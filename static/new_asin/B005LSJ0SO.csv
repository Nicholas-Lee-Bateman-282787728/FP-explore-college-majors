4830173,5,B005LSJ0SO,"I first learned of this video in a listing of upcoming TV specials in a National Geographic magazine that was designed to promote its cable television network.  Within the first ten minutes of watching the show on television, I knew that I just HAD to buy the DVD for my library.  I make no secret of my high degree of respect and admiration for President George W. Bush, and this show only increased both.  For the first time in the ten years since the horrific events of that day, I saw an in-depth interview with President Bush that gave him plenty of time to share his feelings beyond, as another reviewer said, the typical soundbite.

This production is brutally candid, and we see a range of human emotions from the President, including anger, frustration, fear, impatience.  He shares in an honest and vulnerable approach the stresses of being the Commander-in-Chief when we've come under attack as a country.  President Bush admits some faults in hindsight, but this video, much like the book he wrote and released last year, are not designed to make him appear perfect.  Rather, he seeks to explain himself by taking the viewer through a chronology of the day's events.  While I'm sure that, just like anyone else, he would be grateful for people's approval of, or agreement with, his decisions, I sense that Mr. Bush would be content to have people's understanding.

In addition to putting himself and his thought processes out for everyone to see, this video includes some fascinating video footage and still photos that I'd never seen before.  So, beyond just a political retrospective, this is a great history lesson about the behind-the-scenes events of a huge day for our country.  If you are a supporter of President Bush, you will like this video.  If you are a historian, you will like this video.  Even if you are neither, but just want to see the enormous effects of those 90 minutes that will forever be etched into the culture and history of the United States, I encourage you to get this video.",1341100800,4,2017,4.744985673352436
4830174,5,B005LSJ0SO,"I watched this program when it first aired last fall.  I was so impressed with it that I decided to buy the DVD.

It is an insight into how the former President George W. Bush felt during the 9/11 crisis from start to finish.

I am amazed at the details that went into it.  We have the narration by George Bush with detail video footage starting with his jog in Florida in the early morning hours.  Then we are onto his encounter with the children at a Florida grade school.  Then he is informed, in the middle of a children book reading, that a second plane has crashed into the World Trade Centre.

From there we get the intimate details of what happens from when he leaves the school to when he finally arrives home in Washington, D.C. late at night after two stopovers in Louisiana and Nebraska.

A must see for those who wanted to know what the former President was going through that day and the intricate details that were going on behind the scenes at the White House as he makes regular contact on Air Force One.",1331510400,3,1021,4.336842105263158
4830175,5,B005LSJ0SO,"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen showing the thought processes, and reasoning from the sitting President during an emotional decisive time in their career.
It does not matter what your personal opinions of George Bush are, this shows what happened from his perspective during 9/11. What shaped his policies, and how he led the United States through this period.
Personally I found his honesty and forthright talking refreshing, compared to what you normally see during sound bites on the evening news.
A must if you are interested in history, whether you a Bush fan or not.",1326585600,4,590,4.91
8478498,4,B005LSJ0SO,"This features President George W. Bush ten years after 9/11 sharing his perspective of what occurred on that day and his responses. Considering that he appeared on the 700 Club his swearing is surprising and unnecessary. When he shares that other people were telling him what to do it becomes quite sad, he was essentially a prisoner of the machine. Occasional insight.",1485475200,,369,4.967741935483871

8478502,5,B005LSJ0SO,"I originally watched this on TV and believe it is a must have item. It is about President Bush's personal account of that tragic day. I'm amazed how all these years later, there are still new pictures of the events and still new stories to tell. The whole account of how they kept Air Force One in the air for so long is incredible. I don't think we will ever truly know how well Bush handled those events and how well he encouraged our nation through such a difficult period.",1441843200,2,476,4.3

8478504,5,B005LSJ0SO,"This is a great piece of history.  Although President George W.

Great perspective from the man in the top decision seat at one of our worst times.  Shows what he was thinking and what he dealt with during this crisis and what guided his decision to go after the Taliban and Al Queda to enact justice.",1353974400,2,336,4.317460317460317
