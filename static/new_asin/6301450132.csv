Her all girl band was the forerunner of several, and her tap dancing and singing were too much fun to miss.",1386028800,,250,4.229166666666667
7813305,5,6301450132,"This is one of a series called ""MEET THE BAND LEADERS"" distributed by Swingtime Video.  The video is done on a fairly low budget (clamshell case, Scotch video tape) but what makes this so good is the work they did tracking down rare vintage performances by some of the greatest band leaders of the 30's, 40's, 50's, & 60's for this series.  The quality of the old footage is not perfect but you won't be disappointed!
