2327214,3,B0009WFFTA,ok cd I got a few different one's,1364169600,,33,3.25
2327215,2,B0009WFFTA,From the previews and trailers you think this movie is really juicy but it's not.  Of 1hr and 30 min approx there's about 2 min of good stuff.  The editing literally will show a flash then change to something else.  It's frustrating.,1360281600,,233,4.5
2327216,5,B0009WFFTA,I MUST ADMIT THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THE DVD WAS FOR CATHY BACH.IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE SHE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IN THE FILM.LESLIE CARON IS ALSO BEAUTIFUL.THE ACTUAL FILM WAS INTERESTING.I HAD HOPED THE PICTURE QUALITY TO BE BETTER BUT STILL IT WAS OK.I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BUY TO ALL.,1346803200,,302,4.611111111111111
2327217,3,B0009WFFTA,"The plot is hard enough to understand without the low grade cinematography and sound (perhaps a result of several generations lost?). It seems that Leslie Caron, playing Nicole in the originally eponymous movie is an unstable, though wealthy and successful widow (a Dance Instructor more for a time-filler than eceonomic necessity) about in her late 30s/early 40s, who enjoys living out fantasties by manipulating anyone from an apparent runaway with cool looking jeans, to a cool looking Used Car Salesman, another character of means and a day job just for fun money. Catherine Bach (Kathy Bach in this c. 1972 to 1978 deal) is a beautiful Dance student who bears a remarkable resemblance to Nicole, who is so intriqued that she pays for plastic surgery to make the similiarity that much more pronounced.
It appears that Nicole is bisexual and actually has a perverse interest in Sue, on that basis! (Not clear on that one, folks).
The disturbed socialite has a violent counterpart, a Chauffer who was involved in a double homicide, and then adds to that list through a misunderstood communique from Caron.
Many characters pop in and out in this strange movie. Seems stranger that Leslie Caron would actually participate, but she is very strong throughout; has some terrific close-ups.
Regarding the advertised naughty business, it's handled alot more sensitively than one might imagine.
Sue, played by Catherine B., who had to undergo a makeover through surgery in this flick; the flick itself could use a technical makeover; some deleted material maybe re-inserted for continuity purposes.",1232150400,8,1592,5.174418604651163
2327218,1,B0009WFFTA,"This boxed disk was very well marketed, with a nice picture of Catherine Bach on the cover(which sadly you don't see in the film). The film's only redeeming feature I think is that you catch the only semi nude glimpse of this firm young actress who aspires to every young Petrol Head's fantasy as ""Daisy Duke"".
Feel free to make me an offer........  She comes cheap.",1202428800,5,366,4.545454545454546
2327219,1,B0009WFFTA,"Its not a skin flick by any standards! Not worth watching even otherwise. Its a waste of time and money. See the amazon dvd reviews for this, the picture quality problem is also there as in the dvds. (not that better picture quality would have made it worthwhile)",1196553600,23,263,4.5
2327220,2,B0009WFFTA,Awful looking photography. I did not enjoy watching this film because the picture was so faded. Hopefully they will redo this DVD some day.,1131667200,23,139,4.833333333333333
8068159,1,B0009WFFTA,"You probably need to see a really terrible movie every now and then to realize how bad they can get. This very low budget movie is incomprehensible and one wonders why Leslie Caron would have consented to do it. Knowing a bit about her, I'm guessing she needed the money, and one's heart bleeds for ""Lili"" that she should have to do something like this.

The film quality and sound quality are atrocious, so much of the conversation is unintelligible.  But, you aren't missing much because it seems like the script was only a suggestion, and everyone just ad libbed from there. The producer, director, and script writer should spend eternity apologizing for this film.

The only redeeming conclusion is to know that Leslie Caron survived this low point in her life, and in the long run her career has triumphed.",1506124800,,811,4.73758865248227
8068160,1,B0009WFFTA,Slow to start.,1485475200,,14,4.0
8068161,1,B0009WFFTA,Bad production. Terrible resolution.,1475539200,,36,8.25

8068163,3,B0009WFFTA,"Kinda bland when considering the usual Troma fare, but not without any charm or ideas",1463529600,,85,4.733333333333333
8068164,3,B0009WFFTA,This movie sucks the only good part is at about 1:03:00 when Catherine Bach shows her top area (perfect),1461024000,,104,4.526315789473684
8068165,1,B0009WFFTA,not much. poor video,1453507200,,20,4.25
8068166,3,B0009WFFTA,ok lets face it the only reason you buy this movie is to see Catherine Bach nude well you see that but the storyline is beyond bad it is all over the place. Makes zero sense if the reason to see this movie is Catherine Bach nude save your money you won't remember this movie 2 min after seeing it,1451433600,3,296,3.95
8068167,1,B0009WFFTA,"BOOOORRRRING!!!! This one will putcha to sleep! The only thing that kept me watching was the Katherine Bach ""Daisy Duke"" nude scene which turned out to be disappointingly brief. Skip this one unless you just GOTTA see it!",1448841600,3,221,4.842105263157895
8068168,3,B0009WFFTA,A few women are topless only,1445040000,,28,3.8333333333333335
