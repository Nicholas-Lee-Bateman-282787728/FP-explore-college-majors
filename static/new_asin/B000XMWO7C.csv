8228847,2,B000XMWO7C,Not a favorite. Acting was not that great. Donated it.,1455408000,,54,4.5
8228848,4,B000XMWO7C,"Don't need to be a Mormon to enjoy this movie. Scenarios could adapt to anyone. Serious and light moments. Not an academy award winner, but enjoyable just the same.",1369872000,,164,4.689655172413793
8228849,5,B000XMWO7C,"I thought this film was well done. My wife and I really enjoyed watching it. The movie follows the three couples through the course of an evening. Sure, it has its cheesy, over-the-top moments, but overall this made for an enjoyable evening at home. We would definitely watch it again.",1355270400,,285,4.72
8228850,1,B000XMWO7C,"Just watched this movie with my husband of 19 years, and my daugther who's 14, and I must say, we tried so hard to understand......
As contrary to the above reviews, the conversations and interactions were absurdely false and superficial.  Also, they were SO negative overall about marriage until a tiny little reference at the end.  We spent most of the movie at the edge of our seats waiting for it to develop a plot....it never came.  I want my 80 minutes back.",1354406400,,464,4.566265060240964
8228851,5,B000XMWO7C,Thanks  for the movie we do enjoy having it. Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks Thanks,1353801600,,121,5.05
8228852,1,B000XMWO7C,So I'm really not that hard to please when it comes to movies. And I have lots of LDS inspired dvd's but this one was really really not the best - like the worst one I have ever purchased. Rent it somewhere if you really are interested but I seriously would not recommend purchasing this.,1320364800,,288,4.254545454545455
8228853,4,B000XMWO7C,"I was surprised not to see a review for this movie as I believe it is definitely one of the best 'Mormon' movies that has been released. (My wife and I try to see every 'Mormon' film released, and I'd put The Best Two Years at the top of my list and Sons of Provo at the bottom for a frame of reference)

The movie follows the story of 3 different couples as they deal with the struggles and joys of being in a relationship (or entering into one).  The dialogue is wonderfully written and well-delivered in a way that makes you feel like you are seeing real conversations, and in the case of the long married couple several arguments.

The sense of reality throughout is made more enjoyable by it not being tinged with the self-absorbed selfishness that permeates so many movies that discuss relationships.  The characters are honest and are truly trying to figure out how to make a relationship be as enjoyable as they believe(d) it can and should be.  The presentation is sincere and heart-felt throughout without ever being sugar-coated or ignorant of the real troubles that come up in a relationship.  There is no glossing over things here.

The Dance is also very well acted, with a variety of interesting scenes from the dance itself to a bar fight, which makes the entire experience a very enjoyable one.  It's easy to recommend!",1235347200,20,1336,4.6075949367088604
