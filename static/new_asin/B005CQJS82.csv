4653766,5,B005CQJS82,"I wish I'd seen this film a long time ago.  It catches perfectly the complicated mixture of optimism and regret.

We all hope for a loving relationship, even though we know we're emotionally stunted, twisted, estranged from ourselves by our many years in the closet.  We try to believe that ""there's someone out there for me"" in the face of the odds stacked against us.  Pickin's are slim.  We wish we hadn't wasted our lovely youthful bodies on the opposite sex.  But we did, most of us.

We concentrate on growing our LGBT families, a hedge against loneliness and isolation, feelings we know all too well from our lives lived in secret.  We try to see our LGBT friends for who they are, just as we wish to be seen.  And cross our fingers that a friend of a friend of a friend will see us as we are, and love us for our bravery and scars.

Here's to all the late bloomers out there.  We're a plucky bunch.",1395792000,,906,4.3017751479289945
4653767,5,B005CQJS82,"I did not just like this documentary, I loved it! Society does not understand what it takes for someone to come out when there is so much controversy on the LBGT community. The folks in this film were closeted due to hatred of being who you are if it did not conform to society's expectations. I congratulate all five people for finally getting to be who they are. I am a grad student in social work and chose to view this documentary but this would be something for everyone to see, to educate themselves on the pressures and discrimination that this population has to deal with.",1393891200,2,580,4.481132075471698
4653768,4,B005CQJS82,"Wonderful ordinary men and women, people just like you and me, sharing their experiences of 'coming out' late in life. All 'of a certain age' will have compassion and understanding for their journeys, their questions,  their honesty and their love.  It would be so nice to sit down and talk with them all.",1393027200,,305,4.735849056603773
4653769,4,B005CQJS82,"Presented as a documentary, it is very well presented with very credible characters and a work that should be made public on PBS and network TV.",1378166400,3,144,4.576923076923077
4653770,5,B005CQJS82,"Thoroughly enjoyable and great insight into realizing our dreams even at a later time in life. Nice to add to my collection,",1377907200,,124,4.681818181818182
4653771,5,B005CQJS82,"I waited until my husband was out of reach before watching this documentary.  I knew it would touch me in ways that he would only find baffling.  I was impressed by the variety of people describing the complexities of their lives surrounding their ""secrets.""  How painful it was for them to hide for so long, often leading seemingly straight lives for over 50 years and then coming to terms with the passage of time as well as the twists and turns of coming out to friends and family members who had known them for so many years without suspecting.  It was heartbreaking for those who were never accepted by their families and I cried when one fellow explained that he wasn't even told about his mother's funeral because his step-sibling didn't want him to ""cause trouble.""  So many films/TV series and so much literature is available about young people coming to terms with their sexuality and their identity awareness; it is wonderful that there is something out there to show the side of seasoned adults still learning about themselves and how they, too, are evolving with their newly embraced lifestyles.  Bravo!",1372291200,5,1116,4.816753926701571
4653772,5,B005CQJS82,"This is a powerful movie.  I showed it to friends on an Olivia cruise and gave it to them to take to the minister of their ""open and affirming"" church.  In the event that there are a few members of that church still a little reluctant to accept gays and lesbians as fully human beings, this movie will open their eyes.  I'll never forget the sad, hopeful, brave individuals in this film and certainly recommend it to everyone on the planet.",1360972800,,440,4.407407407407407
4653773,5,B005CQJS82,"Excellent, wish it was longer to look into more of their lives. Education is the key to letting people understand what someone endures to be happy in life",1359936000,,154,4.535714285714286
4653774,5,B005CQJS82,"Terrific movie. It is a story about men, woman and Trans who came Out of the closet AFTER the age of 55. Some older than others.
The movie follows the lives of 5 individual people from different places. Approx 10 minutes is spent on each individual. Heartfelt stories. One lucky person finally came out of the closet at the AGE of 79! I'm glad that I wasn't born in those times. A must see for anyone and everyone, who would like to get an in depth and personal look at the different life styles of the people.",1465084800,,510,4.268041237113402

4653776,4,B005CQJS82,"A look into lives of over 60 group that waited to come out until then. Pretty interesting and I really liked the females that were featured.

4653779,5,B005CQJS82,"I felt rather bad for these people having to lead their lives in secrecy almost all their lives.

4653788,5,B005CQJS82,Well done documentary illustrating some of the reasons and challenges experienced by LGBT people who came out after 55 years of age. The people who were interviewed seemed to do their best to be as honest as possible. That showed through the movie so credit also goes to how it was edited. It is interesting and a thoughtful study. Definitely worth watching.,1435968000,,358,4.790322580645161

4653798,5,B005CQJS82,I thought l was a late bloomer at 50. I don't know that there is a better time to have come out but all is courageous. As in the film l wonder what it would have been like younger with family and friends. At my age l don't care so much and am just happy to have put the puzzle together and begin living as l am meant to be. Plenty of gay women sites to find friends and support. You would be surprized how many come out late. The film addresses so many issues in a possitive upbeat way!,1425859200,,486,3.87

4653805,4,B005CQJS82,I started watching this thinking I probably wouldn't like it. Most of these type of shows the people in them kind of overdo it and make themselves look kind of foolish in my eyes. I liked all these people and enjoyed hearing them tell their stories. They all seemed to have their lives together and didn't tell their stories to say poor me. I would like having these people as friends.,1420502400,,385,4.436619718309859
4653806,4,B005CQJS82,"Kind of charming, nice people who changed direction in life late. Good for anyone who wants to do the same, change direction. Become an artist, lawyer, fly a plane, act or be Gay. I came out at 62. But this movie is good for any change I think. It is often hard for someone to start a different path late.",1420243200,,305,4.1
4653807,5,B005CQJS82,"It is great to be able to learn the lives of our older folks and to know that it is never too late to express and be who you are.

We are not the only ones that benefit from the work of those who have gone before us.  Even those who were with them during those times, are now benefiting from the courage of those able and willing to fight for what is right and true.

Often times the gay community leaves out the elderly and as we all know if we lid]sten we can learn allot, they have been there and done that and are now in aw of the freedoms they never thought they would live to see, its an exciting documentary for anyone that cares.",1412380800,,414,3.8255813953488373
4653809,4,B005CQJS82,Educational and Enjoyable. It was very interesting to see a documentary that focused solely on the older generation and the challenges they faced. It was also interesting to see how each of them embraced their new lives and the goals they had for their new found freedom. very insightful.,1412035200,,288,4.8979591836734695

4653811,5,B005CQJS82,"One of the BEST movies on Aging that I have seen since Pride in June 2014.  And best of all, it talks about the Older Generation, those of us who have for years hid in Closets because we lived in the years when being a homosexual was considered to be a mental illness that could cause you to get electric shock or even frontal lobe surgery.  And it is told by the real people who have come out of the closet after age 55.  Wish I could give it TEN Stars.",1411430400,6,454,3.967032967032967

8465795,5,B005CQJS82,"I watched this because I was questioning my sexuality recently (early 50s) and am so glad I did. Theres a lot more material out there for those of us that came to terms with our sexuality later in life, but the stories told here are inspirational. There are a number of adult themed topics, which are ok but may not be a part of your personal journey. I'm also asexual, so that influenced my perspective on the more blatantly sexual discussion.

8465800,4,B005CQJS82,Wonderful movie that brings the reality of LGBT life into perspective.  Would highly recommend for those seeking to understand the struggles and for those who refuse to acknowledge them.,1482019200,,186,5.413793103448276
8465801,4,B005CQJS82,"Just prior to watching this movie I had watched ""Trans"" which had taken me on such a large roller coaster of emotions that it took me several days to regain my composure. I watched this movie and I needed the more lighthearted approach to the 5 individuals situations. Only being trans I could not relate to the 4 gay/lesbian situations but I did appreciate hearing their viewpoint. I agree with one of their friends statements that marriage should be between 1 man and 1 woman. Nevertheless, government should not be in the business of approving marriages. Rather, they should get completely out of marriage regulation and turn everything into approval/disapproval of civil unions. It is ludicrous that people that have committed their hearts to each other cannot be together when in a hospital.

It is encouraging to see older folks make these life-changing decisions. I am not sure what direction my transformation journey is going to take. I am 60 and still not ready to come out yet. It is much easier for young people now than when I was young. Any suggestion to being LGBT when I was young would have gotten me committed to an institution. Even though I would like to be viewed as female, I have gone 53 years without going through the transition. For me, I do not feel like I have to transition to feel female. However, if I get to the end of my life and I still have not transitioned, I will feel like I will be broken having never lived as my true self.

I also think that family members/friends that cannot accept a LGBT person should be ignored. It is of course very gut wrenching to loose connections to these people, but whose business is it of theirs what another person does.",1467676800,,1691,4.596026490066225
