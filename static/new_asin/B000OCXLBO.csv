8463043,5,B000OCXLBO,"VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has come and gone many years ago. The sounds of screeching steel along the rails and the distant sound of the steam engine whistling its way to freedom have long been silent, but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, Jerry Goldsmith's moving score, the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining, yet ever important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. This is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart. To paraphrase ... I once told you Ryan, if only one gets out, it's a victory. That still brings a tear to my eye.",1424736000,,1173,4.726829268292683
