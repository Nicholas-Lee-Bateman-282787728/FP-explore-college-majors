956624,5,6305028699,"Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple, continues the journey of Musashi Miyamoto's (played by the incredible Toshiro Mifune) quest to become an enlightened samurai. This second installment is more violent than the first and includes an amazing sequence in which Musashi dispatches 80 armed samurai. The 3 films in this trilogy cannot be judged interdependently from one another-the epic story (which clocks in at nearly 5 hrs for the entire trilogy) takes the viewer along with Musashi for what I think is one of the highpoints of 1950's Japanese film.",1113004800,3,550,5.122222222222222
956625,5,6305028699,"WHAT defines a man's greatness? Is it power and ambition, or something more? Part II of the magnificent Samurai Trilogy brims with action, force, kinetic energy, beauty and emotion. This film continues the saga of Musashi Miyamoto (performed by the venerable TOSHIRO MIFUNE) and his quest for perfection amidst the lives and loves that surround him.
The film begins with one of the most exciting scenes in the trilogy, in which Musashi duels with Chain-and-Sickle master Baiken using his trademark Two-Sword Stance. After the battle Musashi comes upon a priest who chides him for his lacking the chivalry and grace to match his power.
Much water has passed under Seijuro Bridge as Otsu (the lovely Kaoru Yachigusa) awaits for Musashi's return after three years -a testament to the Japanese virtue of loyalty. During her wait she comes upon the courtesan Akemi (Mariko Okada), who unfortunately also harbors feelings for Musashi, and the already-complicated romance becomes even more difficult as both vie for the same man's affection.
In his search of worthy opponents, Musashi makes enemies with Seijuro Yoshioka, head of one of Japan's most prestigious kendo schools -which in actuality has become little more than a band of thugs. Musashi's brave performance under pressure and growing reputation attract the man who will be his archenemy into the scene, the handsome yet deadly Kojiro Sasaki (played to perfection by Koji Tsuruta), a swordsman of unsurpassed skill whose trademark ""Swallow-Cut"" can slice a bird in flight!
The most awe-inspiring scene in the trilogy is Musashi's final battle against Seijuro's EIGHTY students: the greatest mismatch in history, AND YET he manages to defeat them and face off with the schoolmaster! Once victorious, Musashi prepares to deliver the coup-de-grace when he remembers the priest's words and the lessons of his new experiences. His soul became as polished as his sword. He spares Seijuro.
Hiroshi Inagaki shows his masterful abilities as director (or poet?) of this film. Breathtaking cinematography and color shows the beauty and spirit in nature, which parallel the actions and events in the lives of the characters. A memorable example is a scene of two sparrows singing together, which immediately precedes the reunion of Musashi and Otsu. Ikuma Dan's score is every bit as stirring and triumphant as for the first film.
The depiction of life and culture in 17th century Japan is rich and vibrant in this film, as is the evocative character development of each person. In addition to the superlative, complex storytelling, this motion picture is graced with a noble philosophy: One's greatness is not defined by action or ability as much as motive and intention. It is a testament to the human spirit. INCREDIBLE.",1025913600,27,2765,5.201793721973094
956626,5,6305028699,"In this movie Musashi continues to polish his soul and find The Way. Now he has a purpose in his life and is rapidly becoming famous and sought after. He begins to learn that to be a Samurai involves more that just Kenjutsu, but also requires Kensho(knowing thyself).
Musashi also aquires an apprentice and a determined suitor. Both willing to follow him across Japan and back.

956627,4,6305028699,"Second part of director Hiroshi Inagaki's SAMURAI trilogy, DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE presents two of the best samurai fights of movie history. You have to see Toshiro Mifune defend himself against several dozens of  adversaries in order to understand why this actor has become an  international star.
DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE shows us what implies the  life of a Samurai : strongness with the ability to be pitiful in peculiar  occasions, ingenuity because the Samurai cannot count on his forces during  his whole life and the sense of Honor. With such a commitment, there is  scarcely a time for women. Miyamoto Musashi will have to face a courtesan,  a loving young girl and his wife-to-be : don't be afraid, he won't succumb  to them ! (after all, there is still the final part of the  trilogy...).
DUEL AT ICHIJIJO TEMPLE is a little bit slower than the  first part, with more talking and less wild purchases, but is nevertheless  always entertaining (Jesus ! these coloured kimonos in Eastmancolor !). The  images are not so flamboyant than those of MIYAMOTO MUSASHI but are still  good. Don't forget that it's a 1955 movie.
A DVD dedicated to John  Frankenheimer.",956534400,13,1166,4.852791878172589

956793,3,6305028699,"Better, at least we got to his dueling days and I still wish they would have done more. There was a whole lot of drama, too much and too overdone, very little sword fighting which was sad because they kept building it up and building it up, then when the fight came it was a whole lot of very little. I don't understand the direction this movie took and for those who are not familiar with Musashi Miyamoto's life story the movie was out of sequence. I am once again disappointed, the story was okay, but wasteful, and the whole love affairs, not really, but maybe should be, or can't be, because of no particular reason just confused the hell out of me. I keep expecting it to get better, but it just stayed the same.
Musashi Miyamoto's path to perfect his sword skills was just that, a path, the famous sword man just kept walking away, and away, and away, and away. The duel at Ichijoji was okay, a tleast that part managed to keep me entertained, but this is not a movie for swordsmen. It was a movie for women about a man who looked good in a Samurai costume.",1434499200,,1064,4.272277227722772

956854,3,6305028699,"The follow-up to 1954's excellent Musashi Miyamoto, Duel at Ichijoji Temple picks up the story several years later, as an exiled orphan-turned-swordsman gains notoriety via a bloody tour of fatal duels. His reputation precedes him in returning to his hometown, where old rivals of both a violent and intimate nature await. This is a film about personal growth - specifically that of the samurai himself, who struggles to learn the key concepts of what his new life actually entails and where the rift lies between honor and reverence. We're never quite sure if Musashi takes this lesson to heart, particularly since he's so keen to maintain an impenetrable outer facade in almost every situation. It's a tricky role for period veteran Toshiro Mifune, who struggles with the more nuanced, flatter aspects of the character. In the previous episode, with the fires of young-adulthood to toy with, he excelled. Here, faced with the malaise of mid-life and the accompanying questions of his own being, his performance is far less sublime. The plot, cramped with too many faces and several seemingly-pointless subplots, does him no favors in dancing around the issues and repeating itself on more than one occasion. This could have been an excellent one-act show, and the final half-hour could still stand alone as precisely that. It lacks the gumption of its predecessor, however, and too often cuts away just as the action is getting good.",1401321600,,1435,5.084745762711864

956930,5,6305028699,"The picture is a bit dark (the transfer)at times so it looks like a television show from the '60s, but I would watch a Toshiro Mifune samurai film if he only used his katana to chop vegetables for a salad. Fortunately, Toshiro is Musashi Miyamoto, the greatest fencer of his time, so he slices and dices opponents at will. Make sure you get all three of this trilogy as you will wonder where the day went trying to figure out Musashi-san, why they keep calling him Takezo, and why Otsu is such a big deal with him. Who needs distractions, right? Start from the beginning (a very good place to start they say) and get the full story. It's worth it.",1367798400,,647,4.355371900826446

956935,4,6305028699,"Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai II Duel at Ichijoji Temple picks up where the first film left off. Takezo (Toshiro Mifune) is now on his travels to learn the way of the Samurai. The film opens with the framous ball and chain fight with the warrior Baiken Shishido in which Takezo emerges victorious. However he is chided by a priest for being too tough. The way of the Samurai also requires chivalry and the use of one's mind in addition to physical force.

Takezo then fights with students of the Yoshioka school. After defeating many he asks to fight the school's master Seijuro Yoshioka (Akihiko Hirata). Yoshioka is the lover of Akemi (Mariko Okada)who still pines for Takezo).

Much of this second installment finds our hero on the road to enlightenment. He needs to learn that more than physical strength is needed to become a full Samurai. He leans that it also takes affection and humility. He is taught this by the Geisha Yoshino (Michiyo Kagure). The second installment also introduces the mysterious figure of Kojiro Sasaki(Koji Tsuruta) who seems the orchestrate the violence that surrounds Takezo.

The second fim is presented by Criterion in standard definition with a full screen aspect ratio. The print shows a great deal of wear which is rare for a Criterion release. The disc features a trailer as its only bonus feature. This is a great film that makes the viewer long to complete the story in Samurai III.",1232928000,,1419,4.8312757201646095
956936,4,6305028699,"This second installment of the epic samurai trilogy starring Toshiro Mifune, has much more action than in the previous episode. And while one must view all of the episodes in order to get a sense of the film, and how director Hiroshi Inagaki is trying to develop the characters in the film, especially Miyamoto Musashi (Toshiro Mifune) this is still a very good film on its own merits. But the first and second films are only planting the seeds of this character development, which will fully emerge and develop in the final [and best in my opinion] episode of this great samurai trilogy. This second installment, ""Samurai II: Duel at Ichijoji Temple,"" begins where the first episode left off.

As the headstrong samurai Miyamoto Musashi (Toshiro Mifune) attempts to become a great samurai, we see him battle many opponents, and vanquish them in pursuit of becoming a famous samurai. Moreover, by his challenging others in duels, he is also becoming more skilled. As this second episode clearly shows, the brutish form of combat that Musashi is employing in order to become a better samurai [such as challenging other skilled samurai] leads a Buddhist monk to admonish Musashi becaues he has no compassion, according to this monk. Hearing those lines reminded me of the film ""Sword of Doom,"" in which the antagonist, Tatsuya Nakadai's sword was an extension of his personality. Although, the two characters are a world apart in terms of their personalities, they both use their swords as an extension of who they are, or want to become.

For Miyamoto Musashi, his entire goal of becoming a great samurai is obscured by the fact that he lacks compassion for those he has slain in his duels. And although Miyamoto Musashi is shocked to hear these words, he continues to Kyoto, where he wants to challenge Yoshioka Seijuro. Seijuro is the head sensei of a swordmanship school; and killing him in a duel will go a long way to establishing Musashi's credentials as a samurai with a great reputation. Musashi also runs into Otsu (Kaoru Yachigusa), or should I write, Otsu runs into Musashi, who tells Otsu that he loves his sword more. However, she still remains loyal to Musashi. This is a decent film, however, it is not as good as the first, and of course the final episode is the key film in the trilogy, and by far the best. But this is still a very good episode. But it is the arrival of Kojiro Sasaki (Koji Tsutura) that is of great importance in this episode, which will reveal itself in the final episode. Recommended. Watch them all! More importantly, you will be pleasantly surprised with the final episode.",1166486400,2,2612,4.789356984478935
956937,4,6305028699,"DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE is Hiroshi Inagaki's second installment in his samurai trilogy starring Toshiro Mifune.  In the first movie, `Miyamoto Musashi,' Mifune played a headstrong young who fled his quiet village to find adventure and fame as a warrior.  DUEL AT ICHIJOJI TEMPLE joins Musashi in mid-career.  He's a stud samurai warrior now, not too sure how he made it to that point, but he's a professional warrior whose weapon is the sword and whose code of conduct and strict and exacting.

 I watched the first installment in this trilogy recently and, to be honest, didn't understand what all the fuss was about. I'm beginning to get it now.  DUEL is a tighter movie than its predecessor, its plot (vanquish the enemies from the local fencing school) is more straightforward and linear, Mifune's character's struggle for self control is more understandable, and many of the characters from part one return without the burden of having to establish who they are or how they fit into the story.

  Even the action sequences, particularly the sword fights, are better staged and choreographed here, although they don't receive the loving indulgence given to such sequences today.  In fact, we leave Musashi during one big fight scene, jump cut to a different location that he enters after defeating his opponent.  Leaving him during such times, coupled with the fact that the movie doesn't show much of any of his training, still strikes me as a little odd.  If you're looking for a slam-bang cut-`em-up pass this one by.  The focus is on Musashi and his battle for control, and his striving attempts to `polish his soul' and make of himself a noble samurai.  Interesting, unusual, and engaging.",1139184000,4,1698,4.933098591549296
956938,2,6305028699,"This film has some flaws that bother me.  Let's start with the overall concept, of a samurai who travels the country seeking opponents to kill, in order to become famous as the greatest fighter in the country.  Does that bother you?

First there is the obvious.  This man is killing people who have done nothing to deserve it.  Second there is the value system, the hero worship of toughness, the disregard for humanity, the unethical quest for fame itself.  I consider it disgusting.

Another problem I have with this film is that Takezo has two women pining over him, and yet we don't see any reason at all for it.  No relationships are developed in the film.  It is actually pathetic.  We are given no foundation for either of these relationships.  Otsu and Akemi are in love with Takezo.  Why?  I don't know.  The film didn't show us why.  They just are.  Well, that's not good enough.  Uncommunicative Takezo really has to win their hearts for me to believe it.  He is a lump.  Off he goes.

Communication in this movie is often dripping with phoniness, with ritualization.  People don't level with each other, don't speak from the heart.  They speak and act the way they are supposed to.  It is nonsense.  Ritualization is no basis for honest communication.  Ritualization kills communication.

The cleric is presented to us as a wise man, I suppose, but he is an empty shell.  He actually reminds me of the cleric in Romeo and Juliet who made such a mess of everything.  We are offered packaged wisdom that makes no sense at all.  I think this priest is a moron.

The great book Musashi was not done justice in this samurai trilogy.  And the more unattractive aspects of pre-Hiroshima Japan are focused on too much, making it impossible to root for the characters and their bushido nonsense.  Machismo be damned.  It's not worth a thing.",1130025600,4,1844,4.644859813084112
