I was really sad to see that they haven't put out a complete collection of this series, so sadly the only way to own it right now other than an import is through single dvd's which there are 4 in all. I love the covers, and slipcovers, it looks great on a shelf and it's clean and streamlined. The outer slipcases are a dark blue, and on the dvd case itself the picture is reversible (a different set of characters on each side). Each volume comes with a different poster (which is a superb bonus) that is double sided with a different picture on each side.

Overall a great release of the series, if you can't like me wait for the complete collection to come out.",1356998400,,802,4.276315789473684
