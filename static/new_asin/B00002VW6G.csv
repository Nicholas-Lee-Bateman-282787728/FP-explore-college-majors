1256285,4,B00002VW6G,"I watched this movie when it was new and the leading characters were my parents age.  I loved it then.

I love it now, though, suddenly, the characters are my age, which I found disconcerting, but I still love the movie.

As to the complaints about MS's singing, she is playing a normal woman, like most of us, and is not necessarily supposed to be a good singer.  It is very realistic that she has an average voice.  I loved the very first song she sang when she was newly widowed, something, like ""who told you that you could leave""?

This is a movie I love to watch alone, with a cup of cocoa, and just enjoy.",1226361600,4,612,4.188034188034188

1256287,5,B00002VW6G,"I""m watching it at this moment. I'm about 1/2 way through and I find it interesting, heartwarming, and fulfilling.

My mother was a widow in 1956 and went dancing. I didn't see what fun it was for her, though I had little to say about it.

Watching the movie is like seeing why mother loved it so.

They don't make movies like this anymore. I'd say its one of the sweetest films I've seen in many years.",1174176000,2,403,4.207792207792208
1256288,5,B00002VW6G,"This film was written when the screenwriter discovered that his widowed mother had a secret life when she passed away. He found out she was a ballroom dancer at Roseland. The story was later converted to a Broadway play titled ""Ballroom.""

It is interesting to watch a movie when you are young and compare the difference to your reaction 30 years later. I was all of 20 when I watched this movie when it appeared as a made-for-TV film back in 1974-75. I loved the dancing, and in fact, some 13 years later, my husband and I took up ballroom dancing. The ending was sad and left me rather disappointed, even back then.

At age 51, I find this film harder to watch, because I now strongly identify with the main character, definitely more than at age 20. I've also experienced life more. Although Bea is probably 10-15 years older, the events that happen to her are not too far off for me. It is especially difficult to watch the beginning, when Bea's husband dies, because I've been in that situation already where you are sitting in the hospital, waiting for your loved one to pass on. The ending is also difficult, because you grow to care for Bea and want the best for her, especially after she fought so hard with family members to keep this new life she created for herself. Although a romance, this film leaves you feeling slightly sad and let down after watching it. That's a sign of an excellent film --it makes an impact, evokes emotions, no matter if you're 20 or 51.

One small nitpick: Maureen Stapleton cannot sing--her offkey singing is a little jarring. I wonder why her voice wasn't dubbed. Durning does a better job, but he's no Michael Buble. However, the two actors have a nice chemistry on screen and do a good job with the dancing. This is a wonderful, timeless film and features some great dance music.",1144108800,16,1823,4.5349544072948325
1256289,4,B00002VW6G,"For anyone that is a Maureen Stapleton fan, this story is a wonderful, old fashioned love story.",1142812800,,96,4.705882352941177
1256290,5,B00002VW6G,"I just saw this movie last night for the first time and I absolutely loved it. I bought the DVD because it seemed like a very good movie with a terrific cast and I couldn't agree more. Maureen Stapleton is excellent in this film and she plays Bea Asher, the recently widowed wife with great warmth and sincerity. She even sings in this movie and she does it very well I think. She is also a wonderful dancer who makes ballroom dancing very interesting to watch and learn. Charles Durning is also great in this fantastic movie and they both have great chemistry together. QUEEN OF THE STARDUST BALLROOM, is a magical film and the acting of both Stapleton and Durning is superb. I couldn't help feeling a little sad in the end (I won't tell you so I won't spoil the movie for you). However this is a wonderful movie and it shows that you're never too old to fall in love and follow your heart. They certainly don't make movies like this anymore.",1086134400,33,943,4.394285714285714
1256291,4,B00002VW6G,"I bought this film thinking it would be a concert of the rock band queen, of course it wasn't. When I saw it I got very into the story. It is a very intriguing film to enjoy with all the family, buy it you won't regret it.",980985600,15,222,3.74468085106383
1256292,5,B00002VW6G,"This is a wonderful romance.  Stapleton loses her husband and instead of hibernating buys a\ resale shop and begins to go out dancing.  She meets Charles Durning, falls in love, dyes her hair and both of them sing.  No  great shakes as singers but they deliver the songs better than  professionals would.  Great dance sequences probably filmed at Roseland and  40s singer Martha Tilton sings a song.  For incurably romantics this is the  best thing you will ever see.  I am glad that the DVD is now available  because with a quick push of the button you can edit out the final scene if  you wish.  You can't go wrong with this one. \",963187200,10,633,4.447368421052632

1256297,5,B00002VW6G,"I saw this as a made for TV movie many, many years ago. I managed to get a VHS copy years later. Now I wish I had the DVD but it is no longer available. Now that both stars have passed on it is something to cherish. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Though the ending wasn't what you would have hoped for it left you with the feeling that she did have her chance to find love and renewal again.",1378512000,2,420,3.839080459770115
1256298,5,B00002VW6G,"If there was one video I had to have, after seeing the original production on TV, it was "" Queen of the Stardust Ballroom.""  Searched and searched until I finally found it.  Final performances by Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning  in a beautifully written and acted love story about love between elders.  Show later made into a musical, ""Ballroom"" with Dorothy Loudon, that fell flat because it missed the heart of the show.  Stapleton proves to be an outstanding actress, and Durning excels in his role.  And who ever thought they'd be such good dancers?  Buy it.  You'll love it.",1375056000,,585,4.78
1256299,5,B00002VW6G,"I watched this with my mom and we cried all through the movie,some incredibly sad moments.
But,such is this life..

It's most beautiful,but you have no idea of it's beauty until after it's gone.

This is a hauntingly beautiful film you will never forget. It caught us off guard,the depth of this
movie. We knew zero about it but it had Charles in it,so we sat down and watched it.

His acting is so incredible,it seems like you are in the room with him,and he is in your family..
He's that good !

I had no idea of his incredible bravery..what a man. God,I am afraid we don't have enough of them.

I haven't mentioned Maureen Stapleton yet.. oh my gosh what a performance !!
She has as much talent as he..
This movie rates so high on my list of all time favorites.

It's unforgettable. What a crime someone would ask such a high price from the public so they could see it.
 I could make you copies from my dvd onto vhs,but I can't give out personal info. I want you to see it that badly.

And what a sad thing that it's been virtually ignored. You all impress me that you want to see it. I bought my DVD years ago.",1357171200,,1114,4.172897196261682

7916290,5,B00002VW6G,"This was my Dad's favorite movie of all time. He died very young, in 1978, and one day, I started thinking about old movies and decided to try to find ""Queen of the Stardust Ballroom"", which was almost impossible or monetarily prohibitive as the offers posted were over $100! Anyway, I was persistent and finally got a copy and enjoyed it so much. It is probably not for the younger set now as it is of a time and age that has long passed. But, the acting by Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning was superb and the dancing was fun to see as that's how my parents used to dance. For nostalgic people, as I am, you'd enjoy this old movie and some great acting.",1420934400,2,659,4.28

7916294,5,B00002VW6G,Forget the negatives. this movie is a classic great. A widow gives herself a second chance on life and lives. The Stardust ballroom is alive with life.
