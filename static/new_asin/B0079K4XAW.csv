5067383,5,B0079K4XAW,"I've been a Gintama fan for a while, even though I've only seen the first 30 or so episodes. The main reason I got the movie is for the English language track. Don't hate me anime fans, but I prefer Anime in English. Well my thoughts on the Dub is that they really pulled it off. I was surprised with most of the casting (Apart from Kagura and Katsura). There were a lot of names in the cast I never had heard of. Although I can't compare the dub to the sub. Haven't seen the movie in Japanese and to be frank don't plan on it.

The rumor is that if this movie was a hit Sentai might go back and re-release the series dubbed. Conveniently at the end of the movie all of the characters had a cameo  and all sounded good to me.  I'm all for it. Not sure how well the movie sold. Hopefully well.

As for the quality. I bought it on Blu-ray. Quality looked good. The logo on the menu got cropped off, but maybe the reason for that is I wasn't using my better TV. All in all, it's not a problem. As for the DVD not sure how it looks obviously.  I don't see why it could be poor. The price however was a little steeper than I'd usually pay. I spent $39.99 at my local movie store. You can easily buy it online for a way cheaper price. As I look it's currently about 13 dollars for DVD and 18 dollars for Blu-ray here at Amazon. I figure seeing Gintama finally was release I'd go all out and buy it full price.

My Thoughts on the movie itself. The story was really great. Action packed. Full of comedy. Very likable character. Loved the soundtrack. That said I rather enjoyed it.  The thing that I thought was funny was the show was bloodier than I remembered. I don't mind blood at all. Just thought it was funny.

My final thoughts: It was worth the purchase, and I'd recommend it to any Gintama fan whether you want it for the dub, or just watch it in its original dialogue.  I'm glad I bought it, and I hope Sentai will consider going back and redo their Gintama sales.",1342396800,,1967,4.114882506527415
5067384,4,B0079K4XAW,"I have been a Gintama fan ever since it began many years ago although It took me a few episode to get into the comedy and their silliness since there is a lot of parody in it.
I love all the seiyuu in this anime and the numerous improvisation they have done aside from the scripted story.

So when this DVD came out I was very skeptica to how Sentai did the ADR .The voices of some main characters took me abit of getting use to for example Hijikata and Gintoki because both japanese seiyuu Nakai san and Sugita san has very strong voices and their counterparts don't have the same quality of voice but their performance are up to par.

Both Katsura and Takasugi VA are pretty good. Even Kamui was good. Kagura is not too bad either.

However, Shinpachi's dubb  is pretty weak ,he need to sound more annoying and whiny  he is not quiet there with the character also, he sound too old and the second time I listened to him talk , he sound so ggrrr .. his delivery... sucks.,,ahhh.its very sing songy  .

I also noticed some of the impact sounds are too muted .

 Remember in this movie , all the seiyuu have worked for many years together already while the american VA do not, So some are off and some are not.

 We Gintama fans ,we know the characters more than they do.

Anyway,Its not too bad over all.

The translation are not too bad either for most part  although they changed some context to make it work but man some of it doesnt make sense .And if you watch it in Japanese with the english subtitle you might get annoyed if you understand some of the spoken  Japanese  . Some of the japanese names are  americanized or missed mispronounced as well which will annoy peeps who knows this anime or know Japanese names.

I actually enjoyed watching it in english at first .

The movie version made awesome improvements of the action sequence.

In the first scene after the Warner Brother intro , I noticed the recording of the 3 VA sounded as if they were in the sound booth together because it sounded as if they are really reacting to one another.

I love the extra part in the end as well, it is like a Gintama trademark almost ha ha ha.
I do hope Gintama the series comes back here and there.
(p.s. Everytime I type Ha ha ha ha , I have Tatsuma in my head and so it is his laugh HA ha ha ha ha)",1341532800,,2302,4.210045662100456
5067385,4,B0079K4XAW,"I'm not going to repeat what Gintama the series is all about because it's been done in the other reviews.

This movie was SO good. It takes what Gintama is all about, serious themes mixed with hilarity working together in harmony. There's nothing awkward about how the two go together. If you aren't already a fan, I do hope that this encourages you to watch or read the rest of this wonderfully done series. It's really rare that a good manga has a good anime to go along with it. This movie is only one of many awesome story arcs that are in the anime.

As for the dub itself, it was pretty well done although I don't agree with some of the voices or some of the pronunciations of Japanese words, but what can you do? Hopefully if this leads to a Gintama English dub the people working on it will take a little more care to pronounce things correctly and to ... give Shinpachi better lines and some direction cuz he's honestly the only character that was really wayyy off.

So yeah, this was a good purchase and I am very happy that I was able to buy it and watch it on my PS3!! Totally awesome (cherry blossom ;) ) to have an English dub of Gintama, even if it wasn't **PERFECT** I greatly enjoyed it as a whole. I hope a lot of people buy it! I want this series dubbed for TV viewing <3",1339372800,4,1290,4.172690763052209
5067386,4,B0079K4XAW,"Got the movie and seen it with my brother.

My thoughts about the movie: IT WAS AWESOME. AWESOME AWESOME! Just hearing them have english voices makes me over excited. After a only a few days of having this movie, I had already seen it around 9 times.

Here's my review:
With the dub, there were parts were my brother and I finally understood what was happening. We actually found some stuff in the story that we didn't know. Also, I was able to pay attention and catch pivotal moments in the art work and character emotions that was tough to catch when reading subtitles.

Now as for the voices. Some voices did sound a bit odd to me but I got used to them easily. This movie is definitely professional quality tho. There were some mispronunciations but as long as I know who they're talking about than it's alright. ALso, there is cursing but that's not so unusual for Gintama lol

Kyle Jones did well. There WERE scripting errors that didn't fit the scene, and lines that were given to the wrong character and some lines that were even dropped. I think this could have been prevented if there was more research done on the show. Also, some lines on the movie weren't as funny as I thought it was when it was in japanese, but some lines were even more funny when they were said in English.

Don't let that stop you because this movie is AWESOME. The actors pulled it off.",1338854400,11,1372,4.407114624505929
5067387,5,B0079K4XAW,"Finally, the Gintama movie makes its way over to our humble shores, courtesy of Sentai Films, complete with both Japanese and English dubs (a first for the Gintama series) as an experiment to see if people here would enjoy the dub; after viewing the film, I would say yes, yes we would.

Pros:-amazing animation

-good score

-quality voice acting for both dubs (the exception perhaps of the character Shinpachi, who is a bit rough at the beginning, but by the credits, warms up to his role considerably; on the other hand, Chris Patton does a brillant job of Gin, something most didn't even dare hope could happen)

-hilarious script

Cons:-If you didn't know anything about Gintama going into this film, you will be left rather confused.

-Inconsistent name pronunciation, though it is often barely noticible or worth fretting about.

Blu-Ray VS. regular DVD: truth be told, I'm not sure which would be better--either way, you get an amazing presentation, so really, it comes down to whichever size fits best with your anime collection.

Also, there are no special features, excluding some trailers for Sentai's other productions; this is a shame though, I would have enjoyed hearing what the English cast had to say about their roles in the movie. Regardless, the movie itself is solid and has that trademark Gintama humor we all know and love at this point, and if you consider yourself remotely a fan of anime or Japanese culture, I cannot recommend this film enough. Besides, if you are a fan of Gintama, please support this brillant release, as it would encourage Sentai to continue with this beloved series and, with the quality work they put into this film, it appears the series is in good hands. The potential future of Gintama in the United States is here and it looks (and sounds) worth the wait.",1338681600,2,1809,4.831715210355987
5067388,5,B0079K4XAW,"This movie is kinda a remake of the Benizakura story arc episodes 58 to 61 gintama seires. For those who are unfamiliar with it, Gintama is a comedy series set in an alternate universe, where Japan is taken over by aliens. It follows the adventures of Sakata Gintoki who is always broke. He works like a mercenary together with two teenagers and does various tasks to make a living. The series are more like a parody of popular anime series and characters. samurai, space technology, aliens and comedy may sound strange, but Gintama is really funny and original. However, the Benizakura arc is probably the most action-packed in the whole series. So even those, who don't like comedy with sci-fi elements, will enjoy the spectacular sword fights.

The Benizakura story itself is kept unchanged. Katsura leader of anti-government faction, has disappeared. Some believe he has fallen victim to a murderer, who targets samurai on the streets of Edo. Gintoki wants to look for his missing friend, but is given a job. He has to find a stolen sword, the Benizakura. While he is searching for it, Kagura and Shinpachi are looking for Katsura. They all face some dangerous enemies and eventually discover a conspiracy aiming to overthrow the government.

 The Benizakura arc is awesome and watching it again never gets old. Those, who haven't seen the series, can still watch the movie and enjoy it. The story is easy to follow and the action is good. The movie is Good. The English Dub is Good,shinpachi is one character i didn't like, the voice for him idk, other than him, everyone else was great.

Hoping everyone, fans, buys the movie, so it can sell alot and maybe Sentai Filmworks can consider dubbing Gintama series",1338336000,19,1715,4.843003412969283
5067389,5,B0079K4XAW,"I'm a huge fan of Gintama, and I was really excited to listen to the English dub for the first time. But I was a bit disappointed in it, don't get me wrong it's an okay dub but there are a lot of times where they pronounced some of the names or words wrong. And some of the translation from the original audio wasn't exactly right in some spots either. There was also some parts where listening to the voice actors made me cringe but that's just because I'm so used to the Japanese voice actors. Not everything about the English dub is bad though, I thought they had some of the characters voices spot on.

If you are not familiar with the series, this movie could be a bit confusing and some of the jokes are hard to get if you don't have knowledge of Japanese culture. If you like this movie definitely check out the series if you haven't already. I think next time I watch this movie it'll be with Japanese audio w/ subtitles, the English dub is just too different from what I'm used to, but then again that's just me.",1338336000,,1021,4.235897435897436
5067390,5,B0079K4XAW,"Figured i should put my spin on this if i may,im just gonna get right into this,for those who are already familiar with the series. This adapts the benizakura arc from the Gintama anime,for the most part with the exception of one single cut or two and a pointless added scene (which is made fun of at the end of the movie),the movie is practically identical to that of the anime. However it does have a pretty good boost in quality that the TV anime just doesn't get,so that in itself is a good motivator to get this.

Now for the dub itself: i really had no problem with it myself. Everyone seemed to act out their roles according to their characterizations. The Voice direction given out to the actors seemed to fit within the charterers as well,the best in my honest opinion being kagura. One character in particular:shinpachi,the straight man of the trio was a bit odd. At the beginning of the movie his acting was pretty out there,with him sounding incredibly obnoxious and annoying (of course this making sense as that's what his character amounts to),but as the movie continued on he just snugly fit into his character.

Certainly not a deal breaker, as some other reviewer noted here,but i figured i should mention it as some might find him (shinpachi, off putting.)However the good thing is at the end of the day if the English dub is not your thing, you can always switch the audio to the original Japanese with English subs. However i must say that you should give the English dub a try and judge it by your own merits,you might be pleasantly surprised,i certainly was. Having seen it all in its original language.

No special features to speak of, as many of sentai's releases rarely do get any of them. There really isn't anything else to speak of here,if your already a fan of this series,chances are you already bought this product and already know how awesome it is. enjoy :)",1338336000,8,1891,4.588757396449704
5067391,5,B0079K4XAW,"Let me just say that I love the Gintama anime and was excited to hear that they made a movie retelling one of the best arcs of the show. But as with all retelling anime movies I was also a little worried how well they were going to fit the whole arc (4 episodes) into just over 90 minutes. I was pleasantly supplies to find that my fears were for nothing. Unlike most movies based off of long running shonen anime this one is taken from the main story line, so the main focus is thus on central characters not on the ""new made up just for this movie"" characters. Another thing I like about this movie is that it can stand on its own but also fits nicely into the main overriding story line of the anime; making it enjoyable for newcomers and long time fans alike.

The only sore spot in this release is the English dub; which is too bad because I was looking forward to showing this movie to friends and family who don't like to watch subtitles, but I am too embarrassed to share this dub with anyone.  For the recorded I usually enjoy watching dubbed and most of the cast does an ok job reading their lines, but the voice actor for Shinpachi is downright terrible and laughable (really I laughed out loud, because it was so bad). Now it would be tempting to say that the entire fault lies with the actors, but I have to placing the blame on to the director because it's really obvious he didn't care. The English dub is also pledged by prevalent mispronunciation of names, and just weird localization choices. I think it is safe to say that all my future viewings will be done in Japanese with English subtitles.

Basically if you are already a fan of the show then you will want to buy this movie, and if you are new to Gintama this movie is a good introduction to the series. Probably the best reason to buy this is that Sentai has already said that if this movie sells well they will look at releasing more seasons of the show;let's just hope they won't further insult the series or its fan with another half hearted attempt at a dub.",1338249600,,2038,4.288311688311689

5067442,5,B0079K4XAW,"OK, this is a hoot, but then Gintama almost always is a hoot, period.

Gintama is a very tongue-in-cheek Japanese anime that went some 279 episodes before folding. The comedy is self deprecating, again very tongue-in-cheek and treads on the line of good taste ALWAYS. They way things that would never get past the prutanical censorship that exists in America, especially for a children's show (of Course ALL animation is cartoons for childre...). The series was often in trouble with production executives and sponsors, many times they would break the fourth wall to mention these troubles, which was always a LOL moment while watching the series.

This movie was released after the demise of the show. The series even made jokes about this. As some have said, this is basically a re-do of one of the story arcs, the Benizakura arc. I personally didn't care for the Benizakura arc. That doesn't mean it's bad, I just didn't care for the arc. It is very good, decent story, fun characterization and many jokes and in-references.

As a whole, I can recommend this to Gintama fans. I can also recommend this to not-Gintama fans, but with some mild reservations only because if you aren't familiar with how the characters act and react, especially to each other, you'd be at a bit of a loss to fully appreciate what the hell is going on. Give it a try anyway, the people are fun even if you wouldn't invite them over to your home for dinner (they'd wreck the place).

Difinitely worth it.",1409961600,,1484,4.718146718146718
5067443,5,B0079K4XAW,"Despite me giving it 5 stars (because I totally love this anime and manga series) my only negative comment about this movie is the voice actors for the English dubbing and the pronunciations of the names and Japanese words. Not to mention how the talking is super slow compared to hearing it in Japanese. I just wish the voices in English matched the characters. Hopefully should this series be dubbed in English I hope they'll match the voices much like the Japanese version.

Other than that, this is a must have for all fans!",1405382400,,528,4.617021276595745
5067444,5,B0079K4XAW,"This. This is what I would want if I was to be trapped on a desert island (with a 60"" HDTV and a Blu-Ray player and just one disk of anime. Oh yeah, I guess I'd need some sort of source for electricity too. And maybe some shelter, and a decent source of water and food). I might consider Gurren Lagan if it is available on a single Blu-ray disk, but I think ""Gin Tama tMP"" is marginally better.  Certainly better than being stuck with the never ending Naruto or Bleach. Then again ""Cowboy Bebop"" on a single HD Disk would be pretty sweet. There really aren't many sources of entertainment that can begin to compare to Gin Tama though, for the blend of comedy/drama/action. So if you're about to be trapped on a desert island with food, water, electricity, a 60"" HDTV and a blu-ray player, you should get this. Or Gurren Lagan, or Cowboy Bebop. Or Tri-Gun, I loved Tri-Gun. Whatever... This is a friggen epic anime, and if you aren't already a fan of Gin Tama you need to get yourself familiar with one of the most popular shows in Japan.",1376006400,2,1037,4.345360824742268

5067449,5,B0079K4XAW,"I've been watching the anime since it started six years ago.  When I found out that I was finally able to buy the movie, I was so happy.  However, I'm going to say a couple things here.

So basically, Gintama is an anime that parodies other animes.  The movie however, is a rehash of one of the more serious story arcs in the series.  Edo, Japan has been taken over by aliens (Amanto) and they've advanced Edo's technology far into the future. Gintama follows Sakata Gintoki and his adventures through Edo.  I don't feel like summarizing the story, as other reviewers have done quite a good job at that.

I absolutely adore the Japanese version.  It's amazing and well worth the wait.  I wish it didn't take so long to be released here. Five stars all the way.  I'll probably be watching it every day until they start the new episodes in October and release the next movie and I can get my hands on it.

However, I really dislike the English Dub. It's not that they messed up the story in translation.  They did really well with sticking to the story. I hardly agree with any of the voices.  They don't match the characters.  Most of them sound too light and airy.  And don't get me started on Kagura, who is supposed to be 13 or 14, but sounds like a valley girl in her mid-twenties.  Shinsuke's voice actor does a great job.  Katsura isn't bad either.  But most of the others just don't sound like they should.  They sound light and airy and I just can't take them seriously.  Chris Ayres does an amazing Kamui; he sounds like just like the original seiy.  Maybe it's because everything to do with Gintama has been in Japanese until now, but I can't adjust to the English Dub.  The English Dub gets 2 stars from me.

Still, I'm quite excited for the next Gintama movie.",1347580800,,1771,4.398148148148148

The movie was good, but I didn't like the fact that it had F*** in it. I know anime has curse words, but some of the one's I've watched didn't say F***. I can't stand that word and it makes the show sound bad. The series is awesome so in the future making Gintama in dubb leave out the really bad F word.  :-)

I hope that in the future, the episodes would be available in Blu-Ray along with the final movie. As for the video itself, it offers both English and Japanese choices. The sound though can vary in the sense it can be hard to hear when a character mumbles to himself as opposed to regular conversation. But that's normal. I can tell, when watching this, this is the type of movie you need to have your TV set on a high volume since it's trying to deliver a theatrical experience (sort of like watching a movie in your living room that you always wanted to see with your volume set high to give off that theatrical feeling). I do not regret buying this. The little special scene after the credits where each character was discussing sequel ideas was simply hilarious as well, featuring characters that weren't even introduced until later episodes (like Yagyuu Kyubei for instance).",1437436800,,1017,4.532608695652174
