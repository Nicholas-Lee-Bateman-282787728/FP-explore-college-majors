8091148,5,B000BQYX4W,"Rambo: Force of Freedom animated series is not something I believe most will come here looking for a hard sell. This is something you either grew up with in the 80's and are acclimated to the style and vocal performance that is standard for this era or you're likely a Sly/Rambo fan wanting to grab some unique merchandise from the character's heyday when Rambo was in the hearts and on the lips of millions all over.

If you collect all six DVD's you will have the entire series. Volume 5 is no different from the others when examining chronological order of the episodes. In short, there is no order. But then again I wouldn't look at this series as some tremendous saga that somehow needs to have any real logistical order to establish fairly one dimensional characters. For all relevant purposes the majority of these adventures are self-sustained. If you enjoy the tone and attitude of this show, I think you will see little reason to jump around to reconstruct the mini-series that composed the first five episodes. These are fun and youthful. Kick back with a glass of milk and some cookies and enjoy the fun.

Video quality is completely fine but nothing stellar. From all accounts, this is a straight transfer from the existing prints with little or no clean up in the process. But I would say for an 80's cartoon the clarity is actually better than most, so the overall presentation is actually above average for this kind of viewing. The sound is Dolby Digital Stereo which is plenty adequate for this presentation, but nothing of note to make you think they enhanced the listening experience. Like most cartoons of this period, the sound is a bit flat but works just fine given the basic transfer of the material.

There are no special features, so each volume is a bare bones presentation of the series and nothing more. Note the episode index screen will only show you two at a time but there are arrows at the bottom to advance the selections. This volume comes with 11 complete episodes. A good time for those who want to reminisce or capture a piece of the Rambo marketing campaign during that period.",1488931200,2,2118,4.657754010695188

8091150,5,B000BQYX4W,"This is a great cartoon to have in your collection. Not only is the voice of Rambo by Neil Ross (Lion-o of the Thundercats cartoon series) but it is a great action cartoon. the thing i like most about this series is that when Rambo fires his weapons actual bullets are being fired, not lasers as most other cartoons. The only thing bad about this cartoon release is that the episodes are not in the correct order of television release but if you can get a episode list, you could watch them in the correct order. Other than that, this is a great dvd.",1217030400,,550,4.298076923076923
8091151,5,B000BQYX4W,"Jumpin' Jehosophat! It's another `outstanding' collection of adventures with everybody's hero and everybody's buddy, Rambo! This coveted fifth volume of the Force of Freedom's mind-blowing mishmash includes episode numbers 30, 45, 22, 36, 21, 27, 50, 61, 42, 47, and 25.  Episode 45 is the little-known Rambo Christmas special, `When S.A.V.A.G.E. Stole Santa,' in which the one man army encounters a cynical brat named Brian who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  ""Only jerks believe in all that junk,"" says the grumpy orphan.  Brian changes his tune when he stumbles upon `Santa's Village' and meets Rambo's gray-bearded friend, Chris.  Chris is a full-time toymaker now, but he used to be known as the greatest rocket scientist who ever lived--and Warhawk wants him to return to the weapon building business...or else!  I won't say exactly what the silver-spectacled tyrant threatens to do to this would-be Saint Nick, but it involves a giant circular saw.  There's even more holiday fun to be had with the Halloween show, `Return of the Count.'  Here, you'll watch Rambo use his trusty survival knife to carve a jack-o-lantern to resemble the odious General Warhawk.  ""It's a messy job, but someone's gotta do it,"" says Rambo.  Later, the intrepid pumpkin whittler rushes off to the haunted mansion of Count Vladimir to rescue Colonel Trautman's hapless nephew from a gang of glow-in-the-dark wolves with bad breath.  Episode 50, `Robot Raid,' is sort of an animated version of `The Terminator,' with a terrified young woman in a pink nightgown running for her life from an indestructible android named Max who fires projectiles from his chest.  As your watery eyeballs scan the rest of this disc, you'll see Rambo hop in a catapult jet to chase a runaway missile in Utah...pull Mabuto the sacred white rhino out of a pool of quicksand in Africa...slip into a suit of armor and enter a jousting tournament in Morovia...blast a hoard of hungry rats with his machine gun in the Okefenokee swamp...and wrestle a baboon, an alligator, and a persistent pack of Doberman pinschers!  You'll also see him launch more exploding arrows than you can shake a flamethrower at, and hear clever quips like: ""I smell Warhawk,"" ""Have a rocket, on me,"" and, ""It's tire poppin' time!""  The excitement's not over yet, though, `cause more action awaits on Volume 6!  Like Rambo says: ""I'm not that easy to get rid of.""

Now here's Volume 5's Words of Wisdom, from Rambo:
""That's what it's all about, Colonel: saving lives.""
""Hopefully, Brian, when you grow up the world won't need someone like me.""
""As long as we keep our heads we'll be fine.""
""Anyplace is a great place for a peace conference.""
""The best way to handle a bully is to kick sand in his face.""
""Africa is the second largest continent in the world.""
""If at first you don't succeed, try again as fast as you can.""
""A crown doesn't make a king; and respect can't be commanded--you have to earn it.""
""You can't be a leader without other people's trust.""
""Crayfish swim backwards.""
""It's the person that counts--not the symbol.""
""We're all the same tribe.""
""Nothin' wrong with primitive; nature's always been OK with me.""
""Doctors are there to help.""",1186876800,8,3190,4.925373134328358
8091152,4,B000BQYX4W,"Rambo and the Force of Freedom fights against the S.A.V.A.G.E. evil forces led by General Warhawk and his hechmen who tries to impose their will and control different countries in the world.

The Pentagon has Colonel Samuel Trautman and the Force of Freedom in charge of dealing with all situations that compromizes the world's peace.

Expert mechanic Turbo,master of disguise Kat and ninja White Dragon helps Rambo on his tasks against Sgt. Havoc and an all sort of villanins and mercenaries.

I used to watch this when I was a kid and I like it. Graphic violence is show but noone is hurt(audiencies are 5 and up).

Overall a great entertainment.",1135814400,4,648,4.8108108108108105
