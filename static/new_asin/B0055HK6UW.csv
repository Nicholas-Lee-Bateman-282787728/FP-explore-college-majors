4578150,5,B0055HK6UW,"I was looking for Christmas movies with a nice plot and ones that I would not mind watching every year. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year was a very good Christmas movie. Henry Winkler did a great job as well as the other actors.
The Christmas Choir was also a good movie to watch.
My favorite was Moonlight and Mistletoe. I would definitely watch this movie every year.
It is about the spirit of Christmas. Thumbs up for all 3.",1324944000,,430,4.320987654320987
4578151,4,B0055HK6UW,"Excellent Christmas movies.  The Most Wonderful Time of the Year was great!  Good movie, funny, just a good movie. The other two were also good, but would recommend the movie mentioned above.",1324425600,,191,4.9375
4578152,5,B0055HK6UW,"Love, love, love Christmas movies!  The Most Wonderful Time of the year is great wtih Fonzie.  The others are good also but you just can't beat the Fonz!",1323216000,13,153,4.428571428571429
4578153,5,B0055HK6UW,"This is a DVD worth having. I can see myself playing it year after year. All 3 movies have snags in peoples lives; however, they all have happy endings. I had never seen ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" before and was surprisingly happy with the unexpectedness of it. Also, I had never seen ""Christmas Choir"" before and didn't think it would be very good so I put it aside. Because I wanted to watch something I hadn't seen before I decided to put it in (this is about a week after I watched the 1st 2 movies)and was pleasantly surprised. I recommend watching it. It's a good story line and am glad it was on the DVD.",1322956800,18,622,4.235294117647059
4578154,4,B0055HK6UW,"I bought this because I really like 2 of these films. ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" is about a busy business woman who has a list for everything but can't seem to get any of it finished. She has to get her son the IT item of the season, which has sold out everywhere months ago. She has to prepare for the arrival of her uncle, who practicly raised her. And she has to prepare a Christmas dinner for them and her boyfriends parents. Then in walks a man of mystery. He arrives with the uncle and is invited to stay the night when she learns that he is a chef. Things goes topsy tirvy when he installs the white Christmas lights the neighbors insist with a twist. Help The child keep Santa in his heart. and even help stop a burglary. It's sappy and you sort of know how it will end. But it is fun seeing Henry Winkler, Brooke Burns and the rest of the cast get the Christmas spirit.

""Moonlight & Mistletoe"" is about a busy business woman, do you see a theme, who has a connection with Santa Claus. Her dad, after the death of his wife, puts his heart and soul into SantaLand, a small US theme park that celebrates Christmas all year long. His daughter worked there till she went off to college and began her career in the big city. After a Freak accident involving a sleigh, a reindeer/horse and a beautiful woman, the daughter comes home for a couple of days. She starts off angry that she has to be there. Then she is furious that her father is behind on his bills to the tune of $50,000. Then after being taken by sham artist she gets the Christmas spirit as she tries to save SantaLand. Candace Cameron-Bure and Tom Arnold star in this heart warming story.

""The Christmas Choir"" is about a busy businessman, same theme different gender, who seems to have lost touch with everything. So much so that he is dumped by his Fiancee in the first 10 minutes and is in a bar listening to a homeless guy singing. He goes to the shelter where the man stays and gets a life lesson about how things can change in the blink of an eye. He starts up a choir with a group of guys from the shelter. They struggle to get gigs and struggle with each other but in the  end it shows how one man's faith in mankind can make a difference. This is based on a true story. Jason Gedrick stars as the busy businessman and Rhea Pealman plays Sister Agnes, who runs the shelter.

3 different films with a same theme sort of running thru each. Give them all a chance. It is worth the price.",1321833600,46,2473,4.221987315010571

4578281,4,B0055HK6UW,"I would Give ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" and ""Christmas Choir"" a 5 rating, but because of the ""soft"" ""Moonlight and Mistletoe"" I rated this package a 4.  Really Moonlight and Mistletoe would get a 3 from me, it doesn't stink, but it's just ok.  It doesn't have a very good story line or acting, but the other two are well worth the purchase.  How it got grouped with these other two excellent movies, I'm not sure.  Buy this for Most Wonderful Time of the Year and Christmas Choir, and consider the third one a bonus.  I can't say enough good about the two great movies on this DVD.  Excellent acting and storylines.  Christmas Choir is based on a true story, besides.  Henry Winkler, as always, is great in the other movie.  They are two of my favorite Christmas movies, that I enjoy anytime of the year when I need a lift in spirit.

He brought Christmas spirit into their home.  He showed compassion and helpfulness to them.  It was very touching.  Moonlight and Mistletoe was also very touching and romantic.

4578327,5,B0055HK6UW,"I purchased this after watching these shows during the Christmas season on TV. The main one I wanted was Most Wonderful Time of the Year with Henry Winkler. A great love story where two people should never even met let alone fall in love. Yet Winkler works his magic to bring his daughter and a stranger he meets on an airplane together. And the Christmas season does the rest, but not without a lot of interesting complications including a fiancee. I thought Winkler did a great job in this film. The Christmas Choir is an added bonus and deals with a guy who tries to help some homeless guys pull their lives together by putting a choir together. But he has a lot to learn too about himself and so grows as much as the choir does. But it is a rocky road getting to Christmas. And Moonlight and Mistletoe will touch your heart for sure. Three great movies for a really cheap price. I find myself looking at them even when it is not Christmas since the stories carry Christmas throughout the year.
