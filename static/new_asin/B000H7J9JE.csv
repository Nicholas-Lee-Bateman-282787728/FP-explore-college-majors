2630355,4,B000H7J9JE,"Wanda Sykes is one of the best comics out there. she has a way of pointing out the obvious and making it hilarious. The language here isn't for kids, there are a lot of 4 letter words, but I didn't find it offensive. If you've seen her first DVD ""Tongues Un-Tied"" and liked it, you'll like this. If you haven't seen either, you should see both!",1168300800,3,344,4.2272727272727275
2630356,1,B000H7J9JE,"Don't waste your money on this.  ""Wanda Sykes:  Tongue Untied"" from when she was at Comedy Central is excellent, she performs with true wit and humor, that touches her audience.",1167868800,6,177,4.866666666666666
2630357,2,B000H7J9JE,"I love Wanda and think she is one of the funniest comedians, but I really didn't like how she used jokes to state her opinions about politics especially since there were some inacuracies. Besides the political jokes it was great.",1167264000,3,229,4.75
2630358,5,B000H7J9JE,"Highly recommended, SICK AND TIRED (2006) is comedic great, Wanda Sykes's first solo HBO special.  Filmed in Seattle's Moore Theater before a crowd that howls with laughter for the entire 60-minute performance, it was directed by the legendary Keith Truesdell.

In it, Sykes perfectly delivers the hilarious persona she's developed over years of appearing on Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Chris Rock Show, to name just a few of her performances.  Like a female curmudgeon, Sykes bemoans her unique frustrations with life, Medicare, politicians, scientists, old people, men and everything in between, including NASA.

In the craziest, cranky-baby voice, Sykes steps out of the traditional funny girl role played by popular comediennes like Ellen DeGeneres, Sarah, Silverman, Margaret Cho and Mo'Nique.  Instead she offers the viewer an insider's look into a woman's mind - from an almost male perspective.  But it's not like she's remotely masculine herself.

Supremely feminine, Sykes is a girl's girl: sassy, blunt, confident, practical and an extraordinary wordsmith.  Naturally inclined toward confessing every disturbing thought a woman could ever have, she is a goldmine of information for men interested in decoding how women really think.  And for women, she is the fantasy best friend: smart, chatty and undoubtedly a great chick to hit the town with.

Watching SICK AND TIRED makes me realize that getting to know Wanda Sykes is like learning to use the Internet.  In no time at all, you wonder how you ever lived without her.

2630359,5,B000H7J9JE,Wanda had me laughing so hard the whole show.  It was great.

2630365,1,B000H7J9JE,"She's had a decent run thank to Larry David.  Her 'comedy' is based upon a lot of crass and divisive humor; of course all tethered to that filthy mouth. I am certainly no prude, but after a while one can easily surmise that the language provides caulking for the cracks in the level of talent. I was never a fan and for those of you on the fence about this woman, now is your chance to land on the side of the sane.  Utter garbage.",1456963200,,431,4.0588235294117645

Yes it's a few years old, but she starts talking about some historical perspectives in her cynically/comic manner, and you know which buffoon  she's talking about.

2630434,5,B000H7J9JE,"Wanda Sykes ""Sick and Tired"" is refreshing if you are a black woman -- or any race of woman. She is wickedly hilarious about women, the realities of race and women in this country, and the Bush Administrations' policies and personalities. Wonderful, biting social critique that perhaps only women who are not religious freaks or anti-profanity can truly resonant with. If you're hung up on profanity, don't watch this; it's not meant for you. If you're a right winger, don't watch this; you'll miss Sykes social critique entirely. If you're interested in a woman speaking the truth, then this hour of stand-up comedy is for you. I will watch this many times over, belly laughing the entire time.",1346457600,,695,4.898305084745763

2630445,4,B000H7J9JE,"Comedian Wanda Sykes is a funny lady with an in your face style, and a wicked sense of humor.  In this performance recorded in 2006 in Seattle, her routine plays to her strengths, good timing, and an expressive physical delivery, liberally punctuated by profanity.  Wanda may get a little tongue twisted at times, but it never keeps her from telling you exactly how she feels, as the opinionated Sykes is far from shy.  Her audience seems to be nicely engaged, throughout the 70 minute performance.

Subjects like sex, relationships, and discussing her personal life, work well for Sykes, while topics like technology, dislike of the space program, and politics, may not resonate as well.  Sykes' humor is often observational, focusing on current events or her personal adventures.  Some of her better material involves a racist dolphin, older people on the internet, and women's body parts.  Perhaps her most daring venture involves the scenario where a woman has the ability to leave her sex organs at home.

Sick and Tired has a few misfires, but the humor is mostly on target (3.5 stars).  If major profanity isn't an issue, you may appreciate some of what Wanda has to say.  The concert is also currently available on Amazon Prime.",1329004800,2,1236,4.927536231884058
2630446,1,B000H7J9JE,"I'm a casual fan of Wanda, but NOT this DVD!!
I had expected better. The ""F"" bomb all over the place!! - Which I DO have a problem with!  I think she filmed this in Seattle. And to me -- it's like she decided to make a DVD, and instead of going on the road with it - and filming night after night - and capturing the best night - this is like - Tonight is the DVD night -- good or bad, qualtiy be damned!! And the audio, sounds like it was micked wrong -- or poorly. I bought this used for $7.00.  If they had PAID ME $7.00 to watch it -- I still would feel cheated!!
I don't know if she named this ""Sick & Tired"" or this is everyone's reaction to seeing it.
If I ever catch a burglar in my house -- I'll do worse than shoot him -- I'll make him take & watch this DVD -- then send him a thank you card!!  Scott M.",1327017600,5,813,3.7151162790697674

2630451,5,B000H7J9JE,"An unassuming genius.  She turns all my assumptions upside down.

Her solution for ending racial profiling is to treat all people like criminals.

Her argument that gayness is not a choice is that why would men choose to be with men (they are gross and they lie about everything), and women choose to be with women (they overanalyze everything and talk too much).

Kudos for not relying on cheap stereotypes or sexual humor but forcing serious thought about why we think the way we do.",1298937600,,485,4.670588235294118

2630457,5,B000H7J9JE,"Okay, I suppose it's comprehensible that, someday, Wanda Sykes will release a crummy DVD ....but, frankly, I doubt it.  I mean, it's Wanda Sykes.  It's either Funny, Very Funny, or Hysterical ...what's not to like?  In comparison, I suppose I might, if forced, rate SICK AND TIRED a couple of points below TONGUE UNTIED, mostly because it's easier to recover from SAT.  With TU, I nearly hurt myself laughing, and my stomach muscles were sore for hours afterward.  IT is ""Hilarious"".  If I could find anything negative to say about her act --and it's been said by many, it would be only that sometimes the expletives are a few too many and/or unnecessary to make the point, even considering that she's communicating what annoys her and her frustration and/or confusion about it.  i.e., she expresses some of our emotions for us and makes us laugh instead being ostracized from our peer groups for profanity.  And yet, she's pretty darned good at making it an effective tool.  Especially during the Bush years (or ShrubFest, as I like to call it), I swore a lot, and not always under my breath.  There was a feeling of powerlessness and fear.  Now that there's an intelligent, mature adult in the Oval Office who is not an egomaniac, there's not as much to gripe about there --but there are plenty of places in Congress and in everyday life; so I imagine there will simply be a slight angle adjustment in Wanda's routines.  We'll still need to hear her truthful assessments, her insistence that we notice ""the emperor has no clothes""; and we'll still be compelled to both laugh and seriously consider her thoughts and theories.  True, the smarter, wittier stuff is what makes me laugh, not fart jokes and not strings of gratuitous swear words, and Tongue Untied probably one-ups SAT for that reason as well; but SICK AND TIRED, if you're a Wanda fan, is still more than worth owning.  She is a brilliant humorist as well as a brilliant stand-up comic -- you know the difference.  She's got it all.",1253664000,,1996,4.7118155619596545
