I hate when people go on TV and say, ""Honey, I faked having cancer because I wanted you to pay more attention to me.""  These students who cry that they are victims of hate crimes and then admit to lying really chew me up.  So here, a mother who killed her two sons blames a Black man.  Seeing her cry on TV and say ""Momma loves you, boys!"" made me growl.  This is the Scottsboro case replayed decades later.
Most people say murdering mothers don't get the death penalty because common wisdom says they must have been crazy to do such things.  This work is not about the killer's innocence.  It focuses on whether a woman who confesses should get life in prison or capital punishment.  Her stepfather went on stand and admitted something criminal, should he have been imprisoned after his admission in court!?  The work says nothing on that.
You know it has to be a trip to hear one's ex-husband say he wanted the harsher punishment for you.  Folk gossip says child abusers are treated badly in prison, but I'm not sure if that applies to female and male inmates equally.  Something happened to Dahmer and Geoghan in prison.  The work doesn't say how inmates and officers treat Smith.  I haven't decided whether viewers should see this alongside ""Beloved"" and ""The Joy Luck Club,"" films that touch upon this tragic topic.",1225411200,,1390,4.578947368421052
