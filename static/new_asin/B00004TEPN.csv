7922487,3,B00004TEPN,"This documentary answers the oft-asked question, ""How did an area of San Francisco become the gay Mecca of the world?""  The work goes into the Castor's origins and basically explores gay history and culture generally:  clones, AIDS, rainbow flags, etc.  This work was made years after ""The Simpsons"" showing Fidel saying, ""Those Americans named a neighborhood after me.""  It also speaks of a gay family, father and daughter.  One Black interviewee said something poignant, ""I critique the Castro, but also notice that I haven't left.""  This was informative enough.  It may be a great thing for LGBT community centers to own.",1173139200,,624,5.118811881188119
