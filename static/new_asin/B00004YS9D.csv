7927592,2,B00004YS9D,"I know this is a remake of ""The Boxer from Shantun"",  I do like Yuen Biao and Kaneshiro Takeshi was great in ""House of the Flying Daggers"" but what the heck was this?  It's an over-the-top 90's cheesy production which makes the original with Chen Kuan-tai and David Chiang even that much better.",1516665600,,295,4.547169811320755
7927593,4,B00004YS9D,When will you have that movie in stock again? Because that's the  movie i would like to get on DVD Django hero without chains the old version. Please will you let me know when you will have that movie again? Thank you!,1463011200,,218,4.190476190476191
7927594,1,B00004YS9D,"This is one, awful movie...the editing ruins the movie! The flow of the movie is interrupted with abrupt scene cuts. Certain scenes are sped up and look ridiculous. This is one of the worst edited movies I've ever seen...it's almost unwatchable. The dubbing is horrible, maybe it's better in the original language with subtitles, but I doubt it. It appears as if there are two people doing all the voices, one man and one woman, and the guy has the most distracting, obnoxious voice! The fighting is shot too close and spliced together badly, probably because Takeshi Kaneshiro is not a martial artist, but Yuen Biao is. He, Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung came from the Peking Opera and made great kung fu movies in the eighties. I don't know why his fight scenes are filmed so terribly (maybe for consistency's sake). Cory Yuen is the director and he too is an alumni from the Peking Opera. He is known for making some great Hong Kong martial arts movies with Jet Li; Fist of the Legend I and II, My Father's a Hero and Fong Sai Yuk I and II. Unfortunately with Hero, it's a major FAIL! The story appears to be decent, but hard to follow with the strange cuts and exaggerated acting in some places. I give it 1 star because Takeshi is handsome and always great eye candy.",1437264000,2,1268,4.4935064935064934
7927595,5,B00004YS9D,"What a charming movie.  Violent, yes; Anachronistic, agreed. But also funny and romantic, like watching a strange hybrid in which ""Scarface"" meets ""The Man Who Would be King"" filtered through ""Sherlock Holmes, The Smarter Brother"".",1428624000,,231,5.6
7927596,5,B00004YS9D,"Set in Shanghai before the second world war this film has it all.  It is fast paced and action packed, with 30's styled costumes, and music - and period sets.  The kung fu is very innovative - stunts that I have never seen before.  Takeshi Kaneshiro has Kung Fu!  He is excellent!  The cast is great!  The writing is great!  This film has it all!",1343174400,4,346,4.230769230769231
7927597,2,B00004YS9D,"Watching this film was an exercise in frustration. So much of it works, and then so much of it doesn't, but would have if it weren't for the other parts.
Set sometime at the turn of the century when Britain still had control over parts of China, the story follows a young man's rise to prominence in gangland. One interesting early scene takes place in a dance club and features a pure retro swing band. The hero is the embodiment of a handsome youth as they might have looked before 1930, as he plays drums on a dance number. A rival gang tries to break things up, and the film goes downhill soon after the ensuing fight.
I got the feeling that the movie wanted to be all things to all people; martial arts film, light comedy, light drama, romance, violent gangster flick. The film has elements of all, in what can only be described as a jarring jump through all of these afore-mentioned genres and back again.
Initially, I was really hooked. The film came off as a ""Once Upon a Time in China"" type of film. Broad, epic, fun. There's even a great duel over a pocketwatch that takes place on an open horse-drawn carriage racing down a road. Throughout the film, there are other equally brilliant fights, though they lean towards violent gore rather than the fun, skill-testing combat of the first fight sequence.
Frankly, I felt cheated. The first two fights or so had such great promise, along with a OUATIC-type of storytelling style; light, fun, but serious. Then there are seriously gory fights, shootouts, graphic swordplay, and even a brief rape scene, that make the film appear to be a gangster film with ""beautiful"" film violence. Then it goes back to light comedy, then romance, graphic violence, light drama, comedy, romance, graphic violence, comedy, then more violence. These styles do not usually flow together very well, and I don't think they do in this case, either. All are marvelously handled, which made things even more frustrating despite the skills on display all around. As a graphic, violent mob movie, it works. As a light, fun drama, it also works. As a romantic comedy, it works. As a romantic drama, it works. As all four, it fails.
Cinematography throughout is excellent. Visually, the direction is brilliant. Story-wise, the film is a choppy mish-mosh, and that's the real tragedy. If only the director could have settled on one storytelling style, this could have been a classic Hong Kong film right alongside the OUATIC series, classic crime saga, or classic romance. As it is, there are three or four different storytelling styles mashed together, creating disappointment instead of joy.
If only the director could have kept his hand on the tiller and steered the film in one direction or the other, I'd have been a lot happier with this purchase.
As previously mentioned, the climactic fight is indeed cut for no apparent reason. Probably a transfer error rather than editing done on purpose.",1012694400,8,2926,4.796039603960396
7927598,4,B00004YS9D,"The average Hong Kong action movie is packed with fast-paced action, rehashed plots and poor dialogue.  This movie escaped that stereotype by incorporating another dimension.  In addition to the lightening fast fight scenes and well done stunts, the movie boasted a well developed, fairly fresh plot.  I haven't seen another Hong Kong mafia movie that can compare with this one.  I recommend this movie to those who are tired of the antiquated you-killed-my-teacher genre and are looking for something with a little more substance.",977184000,5,531,5.285714285714286
