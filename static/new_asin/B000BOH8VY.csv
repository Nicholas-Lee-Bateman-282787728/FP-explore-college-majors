2432320,5,B000BOH8VY,This is an interesting story and it is well done. It causes the viewer to reflect upon the most basic issue in life.,1239926400,2,116,4.086956521739131
2432321,5,B000BOH8VY,"It was odd seeing the bad guy from ""Kindergarten Cop"" playing a good guy. This is a good movie. It has suspense, comedy, daring, romance, special effects, drug cartels, guns, explosions, good triumphing over evil, reconciliation, forgiveness and best of all...the plan of salvation through Jesus.",1227398400,7,296,5.456521739130435
2432322,4,B000BOH8VY,Full of action and has a nice theme of the Shepherd taking care of the one lost sheep.  Also good example of Christians doing all they can to win souls for the Lord.,1224547200,2,165,4.0
2432323,5,B000BOH8VY,"EDITED: 1/2014 - I am editing my review as I was convicted by the Holy Spirit about the tone I used in my original post back in 2010.

I think this movie nicely produced.
It is a pleasant experience to watch a movie without having to worry that there is tons of sex, profanity, and cursing o God's Holy name!

The story is interesting. It delves into the world of missionaries and what missionaries go through for in their love and obedience towards God and for the lost.
It's a story of faith, hope and love for God and our fellow man.

It does have a couple of scenes with some *small & brief* violent depictions of having to ""knock out"" a man and put another one ""to sleep"" in an arm choke to be able to accomplish what needs to be done for their safety, but other than that it's pretty safe.
I've seen animated ""children's"" movies with more violence then what was present here!

Also a brief ""romantic scene"" (looking into each others eyes, hugging and a brief kiss) between the two main protagonist in the movie

""There is no better place to be than in the center of God's will .... Unless it's in HIS Presence""! - Doc Mateo",1206489600,55,1129,4.306603773584905
2432324,4,B000BOH8VY,"I thought this was a good movie, with a solid action drama story to go along with the christian message of love and hope.",1175212800,15,121,4.083333333333333
2432325,5,B000BOH8VY,"I saw this movie on TV for the first time and right away began looking for it to buy. Last Flight Out is a very clean Christian movie but in no way would I call it lame. It works great for a family movie or a witnessing tool. In this story you have a hard headed, unsaved man - a very 'joyous' Christian - a dedicated Christian woman (who is also a women of prayer) - and a father who is bitter, and afraid of losing his last child. So basically, it covers all the bases.",1172534400,49,471,3.9166666666666665
2432326,5,B000BOH8VY,"Wonderful mix of suspense, drama, romance.  Columbian terrorists try to distroy a South Amerian village.  Well-written.  Teaches character, integrity, and insight into life's ulitmate purpose.  Definitely 5 stars.  After watching it on TV, I had to buy it!",1143849600,41,256,5.631578947368421
2432327,2,B000BOH8VY,"This is an ok movie for a Saturday afternoon. It's inoffensive and perhaps a little more dramatic that an episode of the A-Team and only provokes the viewer to wonder what exactly other actors do do when not working on bigger movies. This is not to say most of the characters don't gel, they do, it's just that the end product is a hodgepodge of something resembling a turd that even though stepped in refuses to offend the steeper.

About the actors involved, I can fully understand most of the actors making an appearance in this movie, except for the delectable Miss Bobbie Phillips who has so much to offer dramatically, sensually and erotically. Bobbie is excellent at times but the script and general lack of story slows her rhythm down and refuses to ignite any real feelings of suffering or tragedy the movie deals with.

Can't help feeling the movie could have been artistically better and more exciting had it not been tied down to so many moral underpinnings.

Keith.",1138665600,10,978,4.707602339181286
2432368,5,B000BOH8VY,Also an excellent movie. Very Christian based . Shows how God works even in the most dire of circumstances!!,1407196800,,108,4.7368421052631575
2432369,5,B000BOH8VY,We brought this to see a particular person who has a small scene and really enjoyed the movie. Good family viewing.,1402185600,,115,4.523809523809524
2432370,5,B000BOH8VY,"**** Really Inspiring & at moments on the edge of your seat movie w/ *Richard Tyson from - ** Kindergarten Cop... that will leave you feeling inspired, believing in hope again and that is quite capable of putting you in-touch with the inner core of *Yourself !..  ***Awesome Movie & ....

2432371,5,B000BOH8VY,"When a movie comes along that can touch even the hardest heart, you know there was a special power ""behind the scenes"" when the movie was being made. This definitely qualifies and I've watched it twice already.",1393200000,,210,4.702702702702703

2432389,5,B000BOH8VY,"If you love children, romance, and biting your nails during a movie....this is a good movie to watch.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will tell you that we thought this was a NEAT movie!",1364428800,,187,4.194444444444445
2432390,5,B000BOH8VY,"I have been so disappointed lately in the choices for ""family"" movies. Whether it is the language, sexual innuendos, or questionable character, Last Flight Out offers excitement, suspense and a focus on a servant's heart. Although the movie is older, I believe produced in 2003, my family with children ages 10,8 and 5 thoroughly enjoyed it! It was a little scary, as there is violence in the movie, but it is also real to the situation. There is a reference to Operation Christmas Child, which my kids thought was great since we have always participated in that program. Needless to say, this has become a part of our permanent movie collection!",1356998400,,646,4.828828828828829
2432391,5,B000BOH8VY,"Showed this movie at our ""Movie Night"" at church last night.  Great message ~ we all enjoyed it.  Would recommend it to anyone.",1356912000,,127,4.478260869565218
2432392,5,B000BOH8VY,I love movies that have to do with God and/or are biographical.  I also love the Billy Graham movies produced by his World Wide Picture Company.  This movie was very good.,1355097600,,171,4.483870967741935
2432393,5,B000BOH8VY,"This is one of the most wonderful films I have watched in a long time.  It more than met my expectations, and I have watched it several times.  In fact, I'm going to watch it again this afternoon.  I would love to see more films like this become available.",1350864000,,256,4.183673469387755

2432395,4,B000BOH8VY,The is one of the earlier films presented by Bill Graham Association. I always loved teh story and was glad to get a dvd of the film for my own.,1320624000,,144,3.8333333333333335
2432396,4,B000BOH8VY,The movie arrived in the condition it was supposed to and as a family we liked the content of this movie.,1313020800,,105,4.0476190476190474
2432397,4,B000BOH8VY,"""Last Flight Out"" is an adventurous movie full of action and Biblical teaching (the plan of Salvation is presented as well- but of course, you can expect that with a Billy Graham movie). With great acting and hardly a dull moment, it has become on of my favorites. When Dan is sent to rescue a missionary from South America, the trip is more difficult than he imagined. Annie will not leave her people. Matteo is trying his hardest to win Dan to Christ. And the local terrorists with their landmines only help to make things harder. However, with all the action and danger, there is not much blood and violence. Several people do get shot, but there's no exploding bodies (although there is a tense moment with a land mine) or decapitations or anything to make you cring. Kids over 8 or 9 would probably be fine with this one. No language or gross romantic stuff (a bit romantic, but not enough to cover your eyes. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think there's even a kiss.)",1291161600,4,971,4.5227272727272725
2432408,3,B000BOH8VY,"The movie was good. It has a good argument,but its too simple.  When I bought the movie was to use it as an audiovisual resource in my biblical study but wasn't good for that.",1289606400,2,175,4.147058823529412
2432409,5,B000BOH8VY,We enjoyed this movie as a family. Truly tells any person who does not know how to be except Jesus into ones heart!! Thanks for this video.,1289433600,,139,4.185185185185185
2432410,3,B000BOH8VY,"I guess it's logical that since it's produced by Billy Graham it would teach things like eternally burning hell and when you die you go straight to heaven.  But had I known this, I wouldn't have bought the video.  It's still a good story in general. The problem is just with the ending.",1273190400,,286,4.377358490566038
2432411,5,B000BOH8VY,"What a nice find this was. This is an action movie, a drama, a bit of a romance, peppered with some comedy. It has familiar famous actors, a good script, nice production values, beautiful jungle locations and more. A pilot (Richard Tyson) who specializes in risky repossession jobs of planes, even in other countries, is hired by a bitter enemy to rescue his missionary daughter (Bobbie Phillips) who is serving a rural village in South America. She is a part of the Billy Graham Samaritan program that serves villages with medial and religious needs, when local drug lord kidnap the men of the village for forced labor in their fields. Complicating things in the rescue is the fact that she does not to get rescued, unless all the villagers are rescued as well. And she is the pilots ex-girlfriend.
Filmed on location in Puerto Rico. Several cameos including Skip Heizek, who is the past of Calvary Chapel Church in New Mexico.
The movie is inspiring.
This is part of the Billy Graham Presents DVD series, which so far have been great. Other good films in the series include ""Road to Redemption"" a comedy, ""the Climb"" action movie, ""Something to Sing About"", and an older move called ""The Hiding Place"" about the Holocaust. If you are looking for good Christian themed movies try searching for ""Movies with a Christian Theme"" on listmania.",1271635200,11,1340,4.805194805194805
2432412,5,B000BOH8VY,"The Last Flight Out was a thought provoking film resulting in a re-examination of my own faith in God and what it means to be in the 'center of God's will'.

2432414,4,B000BOH8VY,"I first heard of this movie while I was on a mission trip to Roatan this summer. The missionary said that we were going to have a movie night and we would watch ""Last Flight Out."" I was glad that we got to see this movie while on the mission field. I know the actors are not the best, but what is to expect. They played their parts and showed their love of God and their devotion to reach others. I'm glad that I watched this movie, and am about to add it to my own DVD library.",1252972800,,478,3.8877551020408165
2432415,5,B000BOH8VY,Very good movie.  Touched my heart and so glad they are not afraid to tell who is the Lord and the necessity of giving our heart to Jesus.

8090163,5,B000BOH8VY,"Packaging was like new. As far as the movie I love this one. Even though some Christian films tend to be cheesy, I don't think this one is. You can watch it with the entire family because it has action, romance and a family friendly faith based message. Nothing gory or over the top here.
