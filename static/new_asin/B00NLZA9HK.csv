6667227,5,B00NLZA9HK,"Let me start off by saying that I love Shout Factory's releases of 90s Nicktoons! I like that I've been able to pick up quite a few from Walmart as well. But given that there was no Walmart in my area that had this item I had to buy it online.

While this show wasn't really my favorites on Nick I did watch it whenever it aired. Mainly because I did think the concept was weird but funny. Watching this (and this goes for other Nicktoons DVDs) again I notice there's a lot of subtle content that I never got as a kid due to my short attention span at the time. As well as the more prominent content that make me say ""Wow, I remember that growing up!"" Revisiting my childhood programming through these DVDs brings timeless sentimental nostalgia to me. Major Kudos to Shout Factory!

Shout Factory also has complete series of Rockos Modern Life, Ahh Real Monster's!, Hey Arnold, Angry Beavers, and Wild Thornberrys. If you ever watched any of those shows growing up (and actually enjoyed them) I highly recommend buying them. You won't regret it!",1500768000,,1045,4.494736842105263

6667230,5,B00NLZA9HK,I love this video to watch.,1491868800,,27,3.6666666666666665
6667231,5,B00NLZA9HK,"Very cool set. It comes with a collectible poster inside. It looks just like the front of the box art. The DVD menu's are on the back of each case, which is more convenient than having to open and close the case to find an episode. It has cool case art both outside and inside the case. It's a repackaging of the volume sets into one big complete series set. I definitely recommend it.

6667261,5,B00NLZA9HK,"This show is AWESOME!!!!!!!! I watch the show as much as I can on Teen Nick on the 90s are All That block. This show is a classic. This show is down right hilarious. I laughted every time I see it. It is better and 100000000000000 times better than breadlosers. Bread losers and other modern nickelodeon is nothing but twerking, butt jokes, and fart jokes and other forms immature humor. This show uses real humor. I love almost every episode. One of my favorites is Surfing Catdog. I laughed every time I see it . I will never get tired of it. Another this I like is the presentation. The animation is amazing and character designs are awesome. My favorite character is Dog. He is the funniest. Plus I think he is one of the CUTEST cartoon characters ever. I think this because I am a huge dog lover. Don't Hesitate to buy it.",1434240000,4,827,4.376623376623376

6667266,4,B00NLZA9HK,"Shout Factory has been churning out these releases, and I must applaud them and Nickelodeon for bringing back my childhood in full force!
Catdog is something that was yearning for the ""Complete Series"" treatment for the longest while now, and I'm glad it's finally here.
Just like the others, you'll get the discs in two cases, each with this neat little flipbook format. Also just like the others, there are no annoying advertisements before the episodes, either (Disney, you could stand to learn a thing or two from Shout Factory.)

If you're a Catdog fan, I highly recommend you get this.
If you're not, but love Nicktoons, get this for your collection and indulge in it.
If you're getting it for your kids, they'll have fun with it.",1428451200,11,736,4.75

6667273,5,B00NLZA9HK,"Bravo Shout! Factory.
This is one of your best Nickelodeon sets.
All 65 episodes are intact and the quality of the masters is pristine quality. If you don't have TeenNick and can't afford digital downloads I highly recommend this set.",1423094400,2,234,4.875
6667274,5,B00NLZA9HK,I was a huge catdog fan as a kid and couldn't resist buying this. Every episode all in one package and an exclusive poster to match. Not regrets at all.,1421366400,,152,4.1
6667275,5,B00NLZA9HK,"All 68 episodes of CatDog are contained in this dozen-disc DVD collection, all of them are reissued from their half- and whole-season sets, in just 2 normal-sized DVD cases in a box, if you're looking to save shelf space or haven't gotten CatDog on DVD before due to the half-season sets (those kinds of sets don't seem right for a long-gone Nicktoon like this, or those of The Angry Beavers). It was almost Christmas in 2014 when I got mine from the Skyland Walmart near Arden in WNC, and it was still just $19.96 from its days as a Walmart-exclusive set, and it's worth every penny just the same! It sure beats paying over $115 plus tax and shipping for the season sets on their own! Somebody made a typo with the season 4 disc saying ""disc 1""; it's the only disc containing the whole final season of this wacky and memorable Nicktoon series! At any rate, CatDog are a pair of best friends/2-in-1 brothers sharing the same snake-like body, voiced by respective toon legends Jim Cummings (who's most famous for playing Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Dr. Robotnik alias Eggman, and Darkwing Duck) and Tom Kenny (also famous for Heffer Wolfe, the Powerpuff Girls' narrator & their Mayor, and eventually SpongeBob SquarePants himself!), both of whom also have numerous other roles in this show, both major and minor! You never know what Cat and Dog will get themselves into, and they (normally) stick together through them all, whether they like it or not! There's even holiday episodes in here for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Brothers' Day (if it's been declared a real national holiday recently), and even April Fools' Day (known in Nearburg, Farburg, and certain other planets, as Kooky Prank Day). There's also all 3 parts of The Great Parent Mystery, where Cat and Dog search for their parents, and found their adopted parents (their real parents were never, ever revealed) who loved them as their own kids, and still do when they reappeared in the first half of the final episode. From Cat living life like a normal cat without Dog butting in, the pilot episode, to Dog going bonkers from not eating meat, or anything else but air or Cat himself, like dogs are supposed to, the series finale, it's a real treasure trove for anybody who grew up with classic Nicktoons like this, regardless of what their elders thought of them; this and others defined the wacky and hilarious side of Nicktoons in their heyday. As far as I know, some folks used to say CatDog had an adults-only cartoon like Ren and Stimpy did, but the one for CatDog never came to be in real life, and thank goodness for that! And I'm glad such a spin-off isn't real, because now we can enjoy every episode of CatDog in this all-in-one reissue of all their season sets, including season 3 which was only sold on Shout Factory's website until this (and the season 3 set remains very high here on Amazon!); the entire series in just 2 cases in 1 box! ""HI-HO-DIGGETTY!"" Like the box says, you'll find this Nicktoon ""Purr-fectly Woof"" watching, if you grew up with CatDog or you're just seeing it for the very first time!",1420761600,4,3089,4.69060773480663
