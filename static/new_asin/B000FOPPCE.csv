2579752,5,B000FOPPCE,Wonderful double feature. If you like George Strait and Willie Nelson you will love these movies. Honeysuckle Rose is a fablous movie with Willie Nelson and has alot of his music in the movie. Great!,1175212800,10,199,4.714285714285714
2579753,5,B000FOPPCE,"The almost legendary country road movie finally on DVD! Never seen a more authentic movie on this topic. Nevertheless that it's an ""oldie"" already and there are no DVD main menu or subtitles - it's a ""must"" for everyone lovin' country music. You shouldn't miss it!",1170028800,10,264,4.760869565217392
2579754,5,B000FOPPCE,"I happened onto Honeysuckle Rose late one night years ago and it has taken me some time to find this gem again. For all you good old boys who think you're the only ones who really understand Country Music, take it from an CM mad Aussie, this is Willie Nelson at his absolute best. OK, so it was never going to win awards for acting or story line, but Lordy, when you hear Willie get into ""Whiskey River"" it makes you want to get up on that stage with him. I love it.",1168300800,9,466,4.021505376344086
2579755,5,B000FOPPCE,The Pure Country/Honeysuckle Rose DVD was not only a great deal---but it was also a great dvd---fantastic picture and sound.......,1163116800,13,130,5.55
2579756,5,B000FOPPCE,"I have been waiting for Honeysuckle Rose for years!  I saw it in the theater and loved it.  If you love Willie, you'll love this movie.  Slim Pickens is also awesome.  Don't look for anything deep - just a feel good movie with great music.

Pure Country is a movie you can enjoy with the whole family.  If you like George Strait, you should see it.  He essentially plays himself.  Enjoyable.",1158537600,19,391,4.408450704225352
2579757,4,B000FOPPCE,"My family and I love Pure Country.  It is a simple and pleasurable movie with a predictable but delightful ending.  While George Strait is not an A-List actor, he gives a solid performance. Besides, his list of lifetime accomplishments far outweigh most actors 10 fold.

Honeysuckle Rose is just packed with Willie Nelson tunes.  While Nelson is also not an A-List actor, Amy Irving and Dyan Cannon certainly fit the bill.  I'm partial to ""Song For You"", a tune Willie sings at the end of the movie.  And, practically stealing the show is veteran character actor Slim Pickens, who comically swears with flair making ""Honeysuckle"" a ""sweet"" affair.",1151107200,50,647,4.944444444444445

2579809,5,B000FOPPCE,"great movie,if  you like willie.i like the movie",1495843200,,48,5.0
2579810,4,B000FOPPCE,"I confess of these two movies, I have only watched Honeysuckle Rose - as I did not want the other, just could not get the one I wanted separate. Many years ago a ""yankee"" I worked with saw Willie in his ""breakout movie"", ""Electric Cowboy"", with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda, and said he was amazed, because he'd always thought of Wille as just, ""some fool that groans over a guitar"", but now had an awful lot of respect for him. In ""R Rose"", he plays off Hollywood icons like Slim Pickens to similar effect. The music is GREAT, story entertaining and believable, and it all adds up to a winner!

To anyone who likes this movie as I did, I recommend ""Songwriter:, with Kris Kristopherson netx!

Willie plays a character pretty much like himself, and the combination of the music and the story and the characters are really great. Slim Pickens, Dyan Cannon and Amy Irving are all great, and there is a guest appearance by Emmylou Harris.",1401580800,,419,4.121951219512195

Nelson is cheating on his wife, and she finds out. She is just a little bent out of shape..  So this is Nelson perdicament, see how he gets back with his wife.  I enjoyed the music.  Diane Cannon is great as willie nelson wife.

Found that the movie was VERY reflective of Willie's experiences in real life.  A must see for anyone interested in this American icon,  The flip side is Pure Country, a movie with one of the best County music soundtracks you will ever hear.  King George Strait at his best.",1394409600,3,437,4.564102564102564

Both movies tell the story of a musicians life on the road, with slightly different tales. My all time favorite is Honeysuckle Rose, about an old love story, but pure country is about a man in pursuit of new love. Both enjoyable.",1365897600,2,354,4.725806451612903

2580183,1,B000FOPPCE,Honeysuckle is better than pure country but still couldn't get through it. the music is much better - but both films are very boring. Not recommended. See my review under pure country as well,1362873600,,191,4.647058823529412

2580186,5,B000FOPPCE,"Pure Country: George Strait was OK, but the movie was disappointing.

Honeysuckle Rose: This movie was pure country entertainment. Willie Nelson's character, Buck Bohnam, was believable and the band was actually Willie's band. The supporting cast with Slim Pickens was great. One of the biggest surprises was Dyan Cannon doing her own singing. She's got a great voice. This movie was just a good time.",1361664000,3,401,5.1692307692307695

I also recognized Main St. in Maypearl, TX.  The rodeo arena was a bit small; but they never said it was the National Finals Rodeo,",1356652800,2,300,4.418181818181818

It would have given it 5 stars, but after viewing the DVD, I realized that my favorite song and scene was cut.  Why would they cut Amy Irving singing ""If You Want Me to Love You, I Will"" from the DVD?  I've read all of the reviews here on Amazon.

2580283,5,B000FOPPCE,I'm personally not a huge fan of these movies...though I have seen them...but I bought them for my boyfriend who just LOVES these types of westerns (and Willie Nelson) and he seemed to really appreciate the gift and has watched them several times.  I can't really give an acurate product review seeing how I've only seen the movies maybe once but I can say this is a really good gift for that country/western enthusiast.,1312070400,2,420,4.675675675675675

That said, I didn't go 5 stars because the stories were a little lame. Put another way- ""Pure Country"" had a marginally better story with country music, and ""Honeysuckle Rose"" had a weak story with great music. I realize they were both done for the sake of the music and nothin' wrong with that!",1297123200,2,416,4.2784810126582276

She has been looking for Honeysuckle Rose for years and could not find it but I finally did and was so happy and she was happy to until she discovered that the only movie on the DVD was Pure Country.

2580291,3,B000FOPPCE,The George Strait movie proves that not all country singers can or should act.  Honeysuckle Rose on the other hand is a fine film that is almost a tribute to Willie Nelson.  I really enjoyed it and loved the music.,1286150400,,214,4.325

An added plus was the reverse side of the DVD was George Strait's ""Pure Country"".  Both reproduced as good or better than the original.

2580322,5,B000FOPPCE,"When I first purchased this cd only one side worked and it wasn't the side that I really wanted, so when I received this e-mail to send a review in it was forwarded to the lady that I purchased it from.  She immediately contacted me to see If I wanted another or a refund. I really wanted the movie so she checked another before sending out which I thought was extremely nice and sent it out then.  I haven't had the chance to check it but I'm sure it's okay if she took the time herself to check before sending it out.  I think that shows a person who is really concerned about what she sells and the concern for the person buying it.

2580369,4,B000FOPPCE,"""Honeysuckle Rose"" story is like a country western song with some classic Willie Nelson music thrown in.

  I am not much of a country music fan, but this movie is one of my favorites.
  The relationship that Dyan and Willie have seems like a true marriage. Honeysuckle Rose shows the daily life of a family at home and on the road; the happiness and struggles of what happens with separation because of road tours. So there is music, but not too much. This is one movie that you will pause if you need to leave the room.",1227916800,2,567,4.035714285714286
