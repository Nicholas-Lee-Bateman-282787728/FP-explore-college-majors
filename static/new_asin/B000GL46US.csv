2614787,5,B000GL46US,"After my  first birth being exactly what I didn't want (lots of interventions), I was determined to have a natural birth the second time around. A friend recommended HypBirth and I immediately bought it and started using it, early in my pregnancy. What a difference!! I was calm right  up to the end of my pregnancy, without any nervous jitters about a repeat performance.

My labor was similar physically (days long) but completely different mentally. At the hospital, just before transition, I heard a few different nurses say ""I've never seen ANYONE so calm during labor"". I got what I wanted - a completely natural birth. AND I felt great after the delivery!

I highly recommend HypBirth to anyone who wants a calm, natural birth.",1197417600,5,734,4.848
2614788,4,B000GL46US,"I began using the Hypbirth program at 33 weeks.  For about six weeks I committed myself to listening to the audio cds and practicing what I came to realize were powerfully effective exercises.  My husband was minimally involved with the effort.  He watched the dvd once and participated with the excercises only a handful of times.

On the morning of my delivery I woke up at 2:30am ... went to the hospital at 4:30 with completely manageable contractions having been 5mins apart for two hours.  When we arrived the receiving nurse didn't believe I was in labor.  We walked the length of hospital to the delivery, checked in and couldn't wait for the nurses to get out of the room so I could put on the cd.  We ran out of time.  My wide-eyed son was delivered at 6:17am - no pain meds, no drugs.

Too bad they don't make a ""Hyp-Motherhood"" program for the first 6 weeks back at home!

I agree with an earlier reviewer that the dvd production quality could be improved.  But the bulk of the value of the program comes from the daily use of the audio cds - which worked great out for me and my new family.",1196640000,9,1103,4.357843137254902
2614789,5,B000GL46US,"I so strongly recommend this, especially used in concert with a doula or other labor support person trained in facilitating these techniques. I used this CD series to learn triggered relaxation techniques. With these techniques, facilitated by my fabulous doula, I had a peaceful, powerful, wonderful birth experience during which I was focused and physically relaxed. We used the triggered relaxation technique and then my doula softly spoke to me using visualizations from the CDs as well as visualizations that I had written down based on concepts of stamina, trust, love, adventure, courage, and others suggested in the CDs--my own words and images coming back to me. It was such a powerful experience and I feel like I was able to experience it really fully because I was able to be mentally focused and physically relaxed. I was in serious labor from about 7pm Monday to 1:30am that night, though I had lighter labor for since about midnight Sunday night, and I did it naturally, with no medication, and I must just say it was a really good experience, even in all its intensity.

A really big plus is that I used these techniques before and after my baby was born to trigger my relaxation and be able to go to sleep really quickly, which is valuable to a tired pregnant woman and an exhausted new mother with only 2 hours to sleep before the next feeding. Here are the benefits listed by the author, all of which were true for me: * Minimize pain dramatically during labor and birth. * Produce a faster and easier delivery. Reduce the need for an episiotomy. * Enhance comfort and sleep in your pregnancy. * 80% of all clients give birth in less than six hours, including first time moms.",1189468800,12,1695,4.707070707070707
2614790,3,B000GL46US,"Overall, the DVD's and CD's helped me during the birthing.  I was able to relax, and keep my wits about me until about 6 hours into labor.  That is when the more severe surges began.  At that point, no amount of concentration, breathing, or finger drops were enough to prevent my whole body from tensing.  I did, eventually, have to resort to an epidural, although I was 4 cm dilated by then.  My husband's help, in reassurring me, and massaging/tickling my lower back was invaluable.

I would recommend your significant other or support system view the DVD and listen to the CDs with you.

Lastly, I should note that the DVD was VERY poor film quality.  It looked as though it were shot, and probably was, in someone's house with an old camera.  With that said, that didn't necessarily change the efficacy of the message, just it's delivery.",1174348800,7,842,4.635135135135135
2614791,5,B000GL46US,"I started using HypBirth at 33 weeks pregnant and diligently used the program everyday (it's not asking a lot of a 8-month pregnant woman to lay on the couch for 45 minutes everyday).  I was so relaxed throughout my last weeks of pregnancy, I actually was 4cm dilated before I even got to the doctor's office for my last checkup.  The day we arrived at my last midwife appointment, we actually decided to go to the hospital and break my water.  I was already 4cm dilated (and 39 weeks) and due to some health concerns it was best to get labor moving.  When I arrived at the hospital, my midwife broke my water at 8:35 am.  At 6cm the nurse asked if I wanted an epidural and I was still walking around, laughing and joking with my husband.  I'm not going to lie, I did feel pain, but it really wasn't painful until I got to about 8cm.  Throughout my entire labor, I was relaxed and did not feel any fear.  I pushed for 28 minutes and my baby was born.  I was able to have a drug-free, amazing birth and I attribute it to HypBirth.  It helped me to understand that birth doesn't have to be scary.  I was relaxed and happy throughout the entire process and even though I felt pain, it wasn't unbearable.  I would recommend this program to anyone and plan to use it in the future if I have more children.",1172016000,24,1300,4.239837398373984
2614792,4,B000GL46US,"What I hoped for was a natural, relaxed, painless birth experience.  What I achieved was an epidural-free birth resulting in a happy, healthy baby.  I could not ask for more.  The hypnosis program did much to calm my anxiety in the weeks leading up to my due date. My husband was able to participate and facilitate the hypnosis during labor. Although I definitely felt pain and discomfort during my contractions (unlike the inspiring women in the DVD!), I felt in control right up until the doctor and nurses started yelling at me about not pushing and then pushing. In the end, I would certainly use the program again and recommend it to others, but with more realistic expectations.",1162771200,19,684,4.779661016949152
8133351,5,B000GL46US,"I found these cds very relaxing and reassuring.  I used this program along with Bradley birth classes.  I thought it was a wonderful combination.  I was able to have a natural birth with very little pain.  The last hour during transition phase was tough, but labor up to that point was comfortable.  I would highly recommend this program to anyone who wants to have a natural birth!",1385856000,,382,4.641791044776119
8133352,5,B000GL46US,"I started the hypbirth program when I was 34 weeks.  It felt a little awkward at first doing the relaxation techniques but I enjoyed it because it really helped me get rest.  The practices were great, at the end of each practice the narrator ended with positive birth words.  The positive words really helped me let go of any fear or anxiety that I had about my upcoming birth.  From starting hypbirth, I never had anymore fear and was not nervous about giving birth- I trusted that my body knew what it was supposed to do and that all I had to do was relax.

I fell asleep quite frequently while listening to the practice tracks but during my labor it did not seem like a problem.  I was also not very consistent with practicing the finger drop technique.  Again, I did not find this a problem during labor.

Even though hypbirth tells you to relax laying down during labor, I imagined myself actively laboring around my hospital room- using a birth ball, yoga mat, tub, etc.  However, at 41 weeks I developed pre-eclampsia so I had to be induced.  When I arrived at the hospital I used the practice deepening tracks to calm myself (I was very upset about having to be induced!) I thought labor would be slow to start since I was going to start on pitocin so I labored in bed to give myself rest while listening to hypbirth.  The combo of laboring in bed with hypbirth was working so well I ended up staying in bed the whole time.  I listened to it until I was dialated to a 7, at which point I thought I was going to throw up on my ipad so I put it away but kept repeating phrases from the tracks in my head.

Over all I would definitely describe my birth as pain-free but not intensity free.  The feeling I got from labor was a surrendering feeling.  I really had to focus on relaxing and just letting the contractions run their course instead of tensing and trying to fight them.  My labor only ended up being 4 hour from the start of pitocin to birth.  I really feel that my mental preparation and visualizing my birth contributed to the speed of labor which I was taught from hypbirth.  I am very pleased with my birth and use of hypbirth.  In the future I am planning to use it again.  Good luck to anyone considering this program!",1369872000,,2238,4.321342925659472
8133353,4,B000GL46US,I started this program a little late in my pregnancy. I was hoping to go all natural. I faithfully listened to the cd's right up to the end. It was great to set aside time each day just to relax. The cd's worked a little too good because I found my self getting so relaxed I would fall asleep. Easy to do when pregnant. They instruct you to practice some of the techniques throughout the day when your not listening to the cd's. I was not so good at remembering to do this. Anyway this practice must be the key to the whole thing because when I finally did go into labor I panicked and refused to even listen to a cd. I was sure that it would be irritating rather than soothing. Oh well. This program might work better for someone who is more dedicated to it.,1346976000,,759,4.135135135135135
8133354,5,B000GL46US,"I used this Hypbirth set just as the instructions suggested and it really worked! My labor was 4 hours from the first contraction until my daughter was born and I found it all very managable by using these techniques. The Labor Companion CD was perfect. It kept me focused and it never even entered my mind to ask for pain medication. My labor was completely natural and drug-free, just as I wanted! I won't say it was pain-free, but it was certainly manageable.",1290297600,2,462,4.578313253012048
8133355,5,B000GL46US,"Wife of Stephen here: I used Hypnobirthing with my first labor (8 hours) and Hypbirth with 2 and 3 (3-1/2 hours and 4 hours once the herbal induction kicked in).  I can't recommend it highly enough.  The hypnobirthing worked fine, but I didn't want to take classes again, since I didn't have the time.  The Hypbirth program was a good alternative and, in the end, less expensive and more effective than Hypnobirthing.  I am now expecting #4 and again starting the program.  It is hard to explain, but even though it isn't ""pain free,"" the pain of the contractions was not scary like pain normally is, and I felt in control and like I could handle it all.

As far as pushing goes, my first was born in the hospital, so they made me push.  I pushed 3 times and tore before my son was out.  The 2nd and 3rd times, I was in the birthing center and home, so I was not forced to push.  Both babies came out quickly without tearing and without me having to push.  I felt like I could go plow a field after those births, but my midwife made me promise to take it easy and act like I was recovering from a lot of labor.  Both my births and recoveries were easy, uncomplicated, and quick.

I am also comforted in knowing that should a complication or need for C-section arise, I have the relaxation tools at my disposal.  I have even used them in the dentist's chair and been told I was a ""wonderful patient."". If he'd known the trouble I had being a good dental patient before Hypbirth, the dentist would have been amazed.",1289260800,5,1513,4.322695035460993
8133356,4,B000GL46US,"The hypnotist has a very relaxing, pleasant voice, much better than the Mongan Method HypnoBirthing's low, masculine-sounding, female hypnotist.  I would definitely purchase this program over HypnoBirthing (Mongan Method) because it is much more complex and provides great visualization practices that are much better thought-out and meaningful.  The Mongan Method's ""Rainbow Relaxation"" is just too elementary for me.  However, if you can get your hands on the Mongan Method's affirmation CD, this is worth listening to every day while preparing for birth, but it is not enough if you want to learn to deeply relax/hypnotize yourself.  The Hypbirth program is simply much better designed and useful because it goes well beyond a silly relaxation using a rainbow image and does teach you how to deeply relax/hypnotize yourself.

I rate this program with 4 stars because, despite my below comments, it is imperative for mothers to actively practice relaxing, and this program excels at teaching this.  Deep relaxation helps with the last month of pregnancy when many mothers-to-be experience anxiety and other issues that interfere with sleep, and is a vital skill to use during labor. The program also teaches visualization, another wonderful skill to cultivate for a positive birth experience.

Unfortunately, there are sound quality issues on the Hypbirth CD's that are relatively minor, but it would be so much better if they did not exist.  Basically, the three different segments on each of the main CD's were recorded with different sound levels, so when transitioning from section to section, while you are deeply relaxed, you will have to adjust the volume level so you can continue to relax without being distracted by the hypnotist's suddenly louder voice.  Overall, this is minor, but it does happen and should have been corrected prior to release.  There is also static on the second section of the third CD that is distracting.  Unfortunately, this is one of the best sections in terms of content, so you will have to overcome the distraction of the static.  Of course, ignoring something as small as this is probably good practice when it comes to teaching yourself to relax despite distracting sounds around you during labor.

Another concern I have is with one of the main techniques of the program called a finger drop.  With this technique, you teach yourself to drop deep into a relaxed state by raising your finger while looking at it and then dropping it onto your leg, and then going totally limp, and then deeper down to feel as if you are anesthetized. I just can't imagine how this will work during actual labor? It seems that a different trance induction technique should have been used that did not require such an physical process that may not be realistic during actual labor.  This is because it implies that you will need to be lying down or totally supported (including your neck and head)when you go totally limp. If you are going to literally follow the Bradley method for natural birth which teaches you to lie down during birth, the finger drop will probably work well.  However, if you plan to be more active between contractions, ie: walking, on all fours, squatting, birth ball, shower, etc, then it becomes more difficult.  Are we supposed to just go limp and fall to whatever surface we are near, and/or totally depend on our birth companions to hold us up? It seems a bit dangerous unless you are lying down or you are just mentally using (not literally using) the cues to go deeply into relaxation without letting go of the muscles that are being used to safely hold you up. I plan to visualize the finger drop technique, but not literally do it with my hand, and then I will relax everything muscle I can that isn't needed to support me. I will come back to this review after my baby is born in a few weeks (around November 18th) and update my review.

Good luck to all of you, and please know that despite some imperfections, this program is worth its price just for its ability to teach deep relaxation and effective visualization.",1288828800,5,4077,4.8925979680696665
8133357,5,B000GL46US,"I really wanted to take the class, but my husband and I couldn't find one to fit our schedules. In the end, I bought these CDs and he read ""the Bradley method."" It turned out to be a winning combination. I really used the techniques in this book for my labor with twins. I was able to do hypnobirthing through the night until I couldn't take it anymore, and called my midwife at 7am. When she got to my house I was at least 3cm dilated. At that time I got in a birthing tub, which was the BEST technique by far. I continued doing the hypnosis until my babies were born at 2:10 and 2:43. No drugs. This is a great coping mechanism, and I feel it helped speed up my labor.",1267660800,2,670,4.045112781954887
8133358,5,B000GL46US,"I loaded all the CDs onto my MP3 player and started listening to them about week 31 of pregnancy.  The instructions state you should start on about week 33, when you should listen to the same CD about 7 days in a row before moving on to the next one.  There are four main CDs and the other CD's have extra material that you can practice with.  Once you are done with the four main CDs you can pick what you want to listen to each day until you go into labor. I didn't think I'd be able to listen every single day so I started early to make up for some lost days.  I found the instructional video content to be okay, but the video quality was very low budget.  If you can get past the chintzy decor and the bad lighting and sound in the video, the content still does what it intends to:  provide instruction on how to use the CDs. You only need to watch a short part of the video once before moving on to each of the four main CDs. I found the CDs to be great, the four main ones are divided in to three sections each, one that is to relax you, one to teach you tools to use during labor and one that had positive birth words or affirmations.  I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but sometimes the sound level varied on the CDs, with one section becoming much louder all of the sudden.

When I used the CD's in the evening, I fell asleep quite often, so during the weekend I would try to use them during the day and sometimes I'd double up so I could make up for days that I fell asleep or missed practicing altogether.

I went into labor feeling like I had some tools to rely on. I did not have a fast labor; in fact, I had a very long labor, over 30 hours from the very first contraction.  It was a great labor though, and I did it naturally without an epidural. I delivered at a hospital with midwives.  There was a jetted tub in the room which I used three different times. I was checked early on at 2 cm and then I was not checked again until much later. My contractions never got really strong or really close together.  The time between contractions was varied the whole time, with 3 minutes in between, then 10, then 5 then back to 3 or back to 10.  When I was checked the second time, I thought they were going to tell me I was at about 5 cm because of the erratic pattern, but I was already at 10 cm.  I had already gone through transition and did not even know it because my contractions were never that painful. I truly think it was because of the Hypbirth tools that I used to relax and let my body do its work. My focus during the whole labor was to relax every single part of my body from head to toe.  Once I found a position that I was comfortable pushing in, I pushed for 30 minutes. Pushing felt very primal with moaning and grunting sounds I had no idea I could make.

Using this preparation kit was worth it. I mentioned to a friend that I wanted to share this with all my pregnant friends, but someone pointed out that I am the type of person that likes yoga a lot and that maybe that's why this worked well for me and that some folks may not want to go inward like that.  I don't know if you have to be into yoga to appreciate this kind of tool, but I think it's worth a try if you have the time.",1260576000,8,3225,4.006240249609984
8133359,5,B000GL46US,"My results: 6 hr labor and no epidural.  The self-induced relaxation technique made my labor speed by.  I slept through the first stage of labor and listened to these CDs while at the hospital (total of 4 hrs from entry at the hospital until delivery).  There was definitely pain as my labor progressed, but I felt in control (up until delivery).  There is not much training for the delivery period, just let your body do what it already knows how to do.
A great side benefit was improved sleep quality during the weeks I listened to the CD sets.  There are several suggestions in the CDs to help you quickly return to sleep after the frequent visits to the bathroom.  They work perfectly!  I feel this CD set earned its value in sleep quality alone.  The relatively easy labor was a bonus.

2013 Update: I had baby #2 last year and had great results again.  5 hr labor with no epidural or any other meds.  Things progressed too quickly for any drugs to be considered.

Note:  Dedicate 45 minutes a day for 6 weeks for improved quality of sleep and the best labor any gal could ask for.",1222732800,6,1086,4.424242424242424
8133360,5,B000GL46US,"My baby is now three years old. I used this product with her.  I was intent on a natural birth and my first birth (a decade earlier) was a c-section.  The labor nurse said that she had never seen anyone as relaxed as I was.  I kept my fingers near my cd player to begin a cd with each contraction.

I delivered in record time.  They admitted me at 11:XX in the morning with the intention of inducing labor.  I guess my body wasn't interested in a round of induced labor drugs, so I went into natural labor by noon.  Hubby arrived with birth bag (which had my cds).  By 3:00pm, my baby girl was here.  The last time I did this it took 27 hours, so I will take less than 3 any day.

I was very worried about this product not working.  Many days, I would fall asleep on the cds.  No fear, they worked like a dream. If I become pregnant again, I intend to purchase again, as I loaned the old set to a co-worker and never got them back.

Invest the time and money, you won't be sorry.",1208736000,8,979,4.010362694300518
