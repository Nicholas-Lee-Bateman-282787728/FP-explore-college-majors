8754289,5,B01CVS4PYK,"I was so happy to find this DVD of the complete original TV series of this Tezuka's masterpiece from 1969.  I heard it was originally created in color but went on air in black & white because sponsors didn't want bloody scenes in color.  I watched its rebroadcasting as a small kid back in 70's and always wanted to see it again but never had a chance. If you are a Tezuka Osamu fan, you'll appreciate its worth even though you may find some cons for its being a collection of very old TV broadcasting (like a repetition of beginning & ending themes between episodes, etc.). I just found out that the same DVD set costs twice as much in Japan and so a little over $30, it's a bargain!",1472428800,5,684,4.253846153846154
8754290,1,B01CVS4PYK,"The silly live action movie, so reviled by some, is light years above this unbearably simplistic series. Do adults think it's beneficial to show their kids stupid cartoons? Skip it.",1469664000,,181,5.066666666666666
8754291,5,B01CVS4PYK,"I first encountered Tezuka's Dororo from playing the video game ""Blood Will Tell"" From then on I was fascinated and intrigued by the story of Hyakkimaru and the titular Dororo. I have since then read the comic, watched the (horrible) live action movie, and caught snippets of the cartoon (sadly, in only in Japanese). Finally, I am able to watch the entire series, including the ending/conclusion, that was not in the comics.

This DVD set is awesome, even if it contains the basic un-remastered episodes. What it does have however is, what I think is for the first time ever, good English subtitles. I could ask for nothing more. The only bonus included is the color pilot of the series that was never produced.
Dororo tells a great story. The episodes are really faithful to the comic, if not almost exactly like it.

I wish that whoever is in charge of the Tezuka  licenses make a new Dororo series, with updated animation( and maybe some filler stories, like from the video game). I for one am tired of seeing so many iterations of Black Jack, that they should give that character and it's unamusing and often times wildly ridiculous stories a break.",1465257600,6,1154,4.702970297029703
