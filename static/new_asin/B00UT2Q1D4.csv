The dialogue was bad, at times so bad as to be entertaining.

7071063,3,B00UT2Q1D4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Im a fan of Gary Daniels. Ive been watching his films since his early output when video was still around through the current films hes made in the past few years. I have always been surprised that he hasn't become a bigger star than he is. A featured actor in many direct to DVD productions his acting has progressed to far better than the roles he gets. He still handles himself exceptionally well in fight scenes. So why doesnt someone use him in a big production?

In this film he stars as Bradley, a hit man working for The Executive (Eric Roberts). His current assignment is to retrieve a disc of information from a crime boss named Vogel (Mickey Rourke). Vogel offers to pay him off but Bradley has some principles and instead takes off with the disc and thumb drive. Along the way he takes on Vogels henchmen, eventually shooting one as the doors to the elevator open. Unfortunately behind that man was Vogels pregnant daughter who was killed as the bullet went through them both.

Fast forward months later. Bradly has been in hiding from Vogel, trying to keep a low profile. He lives in a bad neighborhood in London and watches as low level criminals assert themselves on the locals. When a brutal pimp continues to beat up on one of his girls, Bradley has had enough. He goes to visit the pimp in his brothel and discovers most of the girls have been abducted and hooked on heroin. A raging battle between Bradley and numerous henchmen follows and he sets the girls free.

But one tags along with him. Shes intent on finding her lost sister, another girl who once worked for the pimp. Sent elsewhere shes trying to find her and asks Bradley for his help. He chooses to do so and contacts The Executive to get assistance in finding the girl. But there will be consequences in dealing with the devil. Another job, another performance of some act without knowing exactly the reason for it. As Bradley moves deeper into the world of The Executive he finds out more than he bargained for. Will he find the girl? Will he confront The Executive? Or will Vogel find Bradley and enact his revenge on him for the death of his daughter?

Action fans will delight in this film. The well-choreographed and shot sequences run from near the beginning of the film until the end. Little time is wasted on dialogue of story set ups but they are there. Instead the makers of this film knew they wanted to make it an all action slugfest and the results are all on screen for action fans to enjoy.

The fact that amid all of that action Daniels can carry off any amount of acting is an accomplishment in itself. He does indeed do so making the character of Bradley a sympathetic one. Hes a man whose done wrong, killed many and will more than likely kill again. But he changes from a killer who didn't consider the consequences of his actions to one who does so less willingly.

While Roberts turns in a decent performance here as does Jeff Fahey, another direct to DVD star who deserves better, there are two performers completely wasted. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah play two of the top leaders in the human trafficking scheme though why they appear and how they are used feels forced, as if the film makers wanted to put them in there for name value only. Their scenes could have been omitted with no lost to the end product.

Daniels fans will find a movie to delight in and action fans will be pleased with this release. If you cant find your movie of choice on hand and this one is there, give it a chance.",1445904000,3,3560,4.47457627118644

7071067,3,B00UT2Q1D4,"Ara Paiaya is a veteran of low-budget filmmaking whos even achieved some underground acclaim with his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dubbed-Dangerous/dp/B001W0Z2SM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dubbed & Dangerous</a>&nbsp;series. He breaks into the slightly more mainstream arena of action cinema with Skin Traffik  a vehicle for Gary Daniels that addresses the very real problem of sex trafficking. Bringing a slew of cult costars and his own set of strengths and weaknesses to the production, Paiaya succeeds in making an entertaining but thoroughly flawed adventure thats nevertheless worth the price for most of Daniels fans.

The story: A guilt-ridden hit man (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Misfire/dp/B00LH98REO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Misfire</a>) seeks to regain his humanity by rescuing a young girl from the clutches of sex slavers.

The films biggest selling point is its cast, which constitutes a fine collection of veterans: Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Alan Ford, and Jeff Fahey comprise a pretty sweet lineup for any film, direct-to-video or not. However, the way these actors are utilized and how well they perform is another matter: few of them appear in more than a few isolated scenes, and even fewer of them get in on any of the action. Roberts and Fahey are the most rounded and integrated characters, while Rourke ad-libs awkwardly and Hannah does her best to speak her lines in an undertone. Luckily, Gary Daniels is growing as an actor, and he carries the picture well enough. Overall, the dramatic content is passable, though its clear that most of these stars have been cast solely for their names on the poster.

Director Paiayah may have overspent on this marketing move, for while the film usually looks professional enough, there are surprising dips in technical quality that briefly make it look like Aras no-budget outings of yesteryear. However, the movie remembers itself promptly enough, and it certainly sobers up for its fight scenes. These too are imperfect, but do more things right than not. Ara edits the brawls a lot looser than I expected and often does not utilize sound effects to signify strikes, but the fights possess a level of energy that I haven't seen in a Daniels vehicle in well over a decade. While Garys one-on-one dream matchups (against&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ron-Smoorenburg/dp/0767819640/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ron Smoorenburg</a>&nbsp;and Paiaya himself, respectively) disappoint, the mass brawls are an athletic delight. This marks the first time in Garys later career that the action of one of his films was designed by a younger stunt team with a more modern take on fight choreography, and Im happy to say that Gary holds his own throughout.

With the movies human trafficking theme, Gary joins a slew of fellow action heroes starring in pictures of the same topic. While Im pleased that awareness of this crime is being treated as more than window dressing, I am critical about the proliferation of male heroes in this setting. Sex slavery is something that predominantly affects girls and women, but in this film, their trials exist only to fuel the righteous indignation of Daniels character. (SPOILER) It doesnt do much for the tone of the picture when the only featured victim (Dominique Swain,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Face-Off/dp/B00AEFXWLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Face/Off</a>) is killed off for shock value after being established as a main character. In this regard, consider this review a distress call to Cynthia Rothrock: we need you to put a female face on this particular subgenre.

Nevertheless, when viewed as nothing more than a cheap action flick, Skin Traffik delivers where it counts and most of its faults are overlookable as experimental touches. This one may divide general action fans and devotees of the more famous performers, but if watch this movie primarily for Gary Daniels sake, you could definitely do worse. I hope that Gary continues to seek out ambitious projects like this, and that Ara Paiaya continues to hone his craft  he might yet become a good guy of the karate scene.",1444953600,4,4313,5.7087227414330215
7071068,5,B00UT2Q1D4,Superb action film!,1444608000,,19,5.666666666666667
7071069,1,B00UT2Q1D4,"Thoroughly dire, haphazardly constructed action movie about a hit man (Gary Daniels who apparently has no acting ability whatsoever) that retires after a job goes sideways.  The Gary Daniels voice-over where the hit man claims to only kill bad people and always asks the reason for the hit to make sure the target deserves it doesn't jibe much with a later scene where his former boss (Eric Roberts) talks about how the hit man became soft after his last job--but the whole movie is that sloppy and inconsistent.

During an early scene where Gary Daniels is ordering takeout in a Chinese restaurant two young black hoods wander in and one is apparently supposed to have shoplifted something--except there is nothing around that the teen could have grabbed since there are no visible shelves or coolers.  At another point some Russian thugs beat up two prostitutes outside Gary Daniels apartment--one is frantically knocking on his door for help but he doesn't want to get involved.  The thugs knock around the girls some more, throw them in a car and drive away.  A few minutes later when Gary Daniels finally makes up his mind to act and goes outside the whorehouse turns out to be about four doors down from his apartment--so what was the point of the car?  Did they drive 100 feet?

Dominique Swain's hammy performance as a Russian hooker is actually entertaining and for a brief time helps to offset Gary Daniels inability to express any emotion besides possibly indifference.  Unfortunately Skin Traffik makes the very great mistake of killing her off and with her goes literally the only entertainment value the movie actually had.

The supporting cast is filled with talented actors including Mickey Rourke, Daryl Hannah, Eric Roberts, Michael Madsen, and Jeff Fahey--all of whom are wasted, although Eric Roberts at least seems to be trying to make the most of his limited screen-time--nobody else makes an impression, all were likely hired for one day's work each and considering what a patchwork mess the script is it's quite possible none of them even knew what the movie was about.

Skin Traffik has a cobbled together script that rarely makes sense for more than 20 minutes at a time, action scenes staged with no skill, energy or imagination and a cast of slumming actors--Mickey Rourke's Oscar nominated turn in The Wrestler was already seven years ago but watching Skin Traffik it feels more like twenty.  This one is worthless except for the 10 minutes or so that Dominique Swain manages to enliven--even hardcore action movie junkies would be wasting their time with this one.",1436918400,,2594,4.926605504587156
8708230,4,B00UT2Q1D4,"An assassin searches for redemption in London after he accidentally kills a pregnant woman in ""Instant Death"" director Ara Paiaya's gutsy actioneer ""Skin Traffik"" with martial artist Gary Daniels supported by a solid cast of veterans, including Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Jeff Fahey, and Eric Roberts. This slickly-made, contemporary action thriller qualifies as standard-issue stuff, but Paiaya has a knack for choreographing exciting close-quarter combat scenes with lots of gratuitous gunfire. Gary Daniels is solidly cast as Bradley, and he kicks ass and shoots bad guys galore. Mind you, the villains are a vicious lot, but Bradley also has to worry about a tough cop, Detective Brooks (Jerry Anderson of ""Instant Death""), who is on his trail. After he kills the pregnant girl by accident, Bradley decides to help a couple of prostitutes from their abusive pimps. This madness escalates in Adam Davidson's complicated, globe-trotting screenplay when Bradley learns that the prostitutes are innocent girls sold into modern-day white slavery rings. A well-tailored Eric Roberts plays the chief villain with his usual charismatic flair. There are few surprises in this hard-knuckled melodrama, but Paiaya has delivered a predictable but entertaining shoot'em up with an ending yearning for a sequel. At the rate that he is going Ara Paiaya could turn into a top-flight helmer. Incidentally, he turns up in a peripheral role as a henchman who dies a particularly nasty death.",1498003200,,1494,5.416309012875536
