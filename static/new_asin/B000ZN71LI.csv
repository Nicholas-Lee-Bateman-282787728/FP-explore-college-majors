8236057,5,B000ZN71LI,This movie must have a cult following somewhere. So many one liners...takes me right back to those days between college and adulthood.,1383696000,,134,5.136363636363637
8236058,1,B000ZN71LI,"I usually enjoy toilet humor but this is exactly what the title says...Poop! This was so bad, when I ejected it from the blu-ray, I threw it in the trash. Nothing to laugh at but a whole lot of eye rolling. How did this movie generate an overall 4 stars is beyond me. I've seen better poop in the toilet. Literally, its that horrible. Save ur money, save ur time. You'll thank me later.",1371081600,,386,4.22972972972973
8236059,2,B000ZN71LI,The soundtrack had Lakota on it which is the only part of the movie I liked outside of the nudity.,1229731200,,98,3.95
8236060,5,B000ZN71LI,"Alright, maybe I'm just biased because this movie takes place in my hometown and I pretty much lived it out for two years, but this movie is something different. Of course many people will see this as nothing more than another sick humor teen movie, but I think they're missing a lot. There's an intelligence behind this movie that many people may not recognize, but I sure do. Of course on it's surface it's offensive and sophomoric, but there's also a depth of originality that's lacking in most movies in the same genre. Of course, anyone who's from Connecticut will be amazing at how accurate this movie is. I actually used to party at that exact same place in the woods they have the bonfire and even sat on the very same rock the main character and his girl sit to talk. Parties like that really do happen up there and I could tell many stories about drunken nights stumbling around the woods lost and falling into pricker bushes. I swear I still have scars from that. This really is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I'm amazed someone made a movie that resembled my life in CT after college so much.",1218672000,2,1120,4.46829268292683
8236061,5,B000ZN71LI,"This movie is a MUST SEE if you ever went to college, or just partied like a college student at some point in your life!!  I was literally laughing out loud throughout the entire movie.. the keg-parties, the random hook-ups, the casual and frequent displays of nudity, the quarter-life crisis moment once you graduate and realize you now have to grow up and get a job.  Ahhhh!!  :)  This film is so true-to-life, it's almost scary.. ;)  Buy (or rent) this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",1206921600,,490,4.6395348837209305
8236062,4,B000ZN71LI,"There is some spam on this page, but this movie honestly deserves at least one honest good review.  If you're expecting the subtle and cerebral humor of Dumb & Dumber, you should enjoy it.  There are numerous laugh out loud moments, but it's often cliched.  If you look at the cover, you know what you're getting into.  If it looks like the kind of movie you like, it doesn't disappoint.  There's nothing really new here, aside from the surprisingly good actors, who are basically unheard of.  Keep an eye out for some of these people.  It's off the beaten path and you've never heard of anyone involved.  This movie is worth a chance.",1204675200,7,635,4.557522123893805
8236063,4,B000ZN71LI,"If this movie was compared to other teen/college humour movies then it would do really well. It's got a crass laugh out loud humour some would find hysterical and most would find mildly amusing. There are some good moments in the movie although overall it is fairly moronic in its outlook. However, it doesn't really pretend to be anything else and to that end, I gave it 4 stars",1204588800,7,379,4.507246376811594
8236064,5,B000ZN71LI,"American Poop is by far one of the best movies about college life and the antics we all went through (or heard about!)... funny, entertaining, and a must see if you are a fan of other American cult classics.",1200787200,2,207,4.333333333333333
