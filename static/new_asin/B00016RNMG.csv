8324784,5,B00016RNMG,"This isn't your typical Honda video. Remember, this was made in Japan, not in America. Therefore, all of the Honda's in this video aren't ricers, haha. I found the NSX tests to be very interesting. You would assume the NSX-R is the best, right? Think again. The Tsukuba battle is great, I love the track and they are always having fun while making these episodes. The final battle is also really good. I personally purchased this specially for the NSX and s2000 features. Love to see JDM tuned S2000's and NSX's.

Cheers",1308787200,,520,4.6521739130434785
8324785,5,B00016RNMG,This is good if you want to learn more about Honda cars.  Great comparison of the NSX from different years.,1206921600,,107,4.35

8324787,5,B00016RNMG,"This is by far my favorite BMI video, with superior video and audio quality. Concise is the word that comes to mind when describing the topics covered. All of the key points are covered in english, and if you happen to read hirigana or katakana, you'll know more than you need to. All japanese speech is converted to english, which can be a bit aggravating if you know japanese, but the main points are always covered when it's converted to english.",1191196800,,449,4.555555555555555
8324788,4,B00016RNMG,"After several years of seeing the import scene build as it has, I had made a horrible generalization about Honda cars in general:  They suck.  NOT a good thing to say, especially since I saw this DVD.  You see, the average ""Honda Tuner"" here in Southern New Jersey has a tendency to place an inordinate emphasis on the ""bling"" aspect of tuning, meaning ridiculously large spoilers and mufflers, and graphics that contrast sickeningly with the factory paint (correction, for I have seen a Honda Civic hatchback painted day-glo orange.  Yuck!!!).  In this DVD (Roaring VTEC:  The Battles at 10,000 RPM) the tuners here are true enthusiasts wringing every hidden drop of horsepower from their diminuitive engines.  A large majority of these (naturally aspirated) engines exceed a specific output of over 120 bhp/liter of engine displacement.  All of the cars are tuned with performance in mind, and the folks that tune them are genuinely humble and inquisitive.  They take criticism (from Drift King Tsuchiya and race driver Orido) in stride, for these gentlemen are clearly superior drivers and are keenly aware of what works and what does not.  You also get a good helping of Japanese humor, which is an acquired taste (for better or worse).  They also show you what was done to these cars to make them the formidable machines that they are.  My only gripe, and I am reaching for one here, is the rough translation from the original Japanese to English.  Sometimes the producers overdub the voices, or they just use subtitles with some misspelled words.  Other than that, this video is a must for the guy or girl who wishes to tune their VTEC powered Honda.  Do it the right way!!!",1093824000,9,1680,4.84561403508772
