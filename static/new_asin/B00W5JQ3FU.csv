7120234,5,B00W5JQ3FU,Awesome!!,1439769600,,9,9.0
7120235,4,B00W5JQ3FU,"As host DDP predicted at the end of Volume 2, here we are with more Monday Nitro action--and back as host once again is the 3 time, 3 time, 3 time World Champion, Diamond Dallas Page. It's always good to go back and revisit what was the wrestling business at its peak, during the awesome Monday Night War between WCW and the WWF--now, of course, WWE who own the entire NWA/WCW video library.

I'm still wondering however about some of the material not used--i.e., the many awesome promos that Ric Flair cut not only on Nitro, but Thunder as well. Even when WCW was at its lowest points--the low point being Vince Russo in charge--it seemed that we the viewers could always count on the Nature Boy to cut some of the most entertaining promos in the business.

But--as I said on another review--it seems requisite to point out what WWE didn't include on these wrestling collections. And I'm wondering if I'll do the same sort of griping when the new Sting DVD comes out in a few months, heh.

But--all that aside--this is another good collection of a bygone era & who knows, maybe, just maybe, there's a 4th volume of ""Monday Nitro"" to come (one can only hope).

4 stars",1439251200,,1168,4.495283018867925
7120236,4,B00W5JQ3FU,"I have volumes 1 and 2, so I can't wait for this! When they say the ""best of,"" they really mean it. These collections provide some great behind the scenes stories from host Diamond Dallas Page, as well as the most hard-hitting matches, and most memorable promos from the glory days of the WCW/nWo war.

If you watched wrestling at all in the mid to late 90's, pick up volumes 1 and 2 now, you won't regret it!

I do have one complaint though...since it's presented by WWE so long after the buyout, they changed a LOT of the audio. For example, Goldberg's theme song is changed in all matches to that of his WWE appearances, and since they doctored the audio, you can hear the audio track of the crowd cheering loop over and over. It's not a big enough complaint to suggest not buying it, but it does wear on you in the first few matches.",1438041600,4,837,4.291139240506329

For whatever dumb reason; Amazon will not let me upload the rest of the DVD content. So for what's posted and what's not I will say that this looks to be yet another amazing set in the continuing ""Best of Nitro"" series. Amazing matches and moments like Savage vs Luger, NWO takes over Nitro, Jericho vs Juventud, Outsiders vs Luger and Page, Bret vs Booker T, the Texas Tornado US Championship Ladder Match, and several others are reasons to pick up this DVD set and add it to your collection. If you're a fan of Nitro or reliving the old WCW days, this is definitely a set for you. If you haven't gotten the previous 2 Nitro sets, it's best to get them along with this set to have all the best Nitro moments and matches at your fingertips. This Nitro series has been great but I'm hoping that they move from Nitro in the future and put out a Best of Thunder DVD set.",1436745600,,1349,4.502057613168724

7120264,4,B00W5JQ3FU,"Back by popular demand is another volume of ""Best Of WCW Monday Nitro"" with Diamond Dallas Page once again returning (looking like he wore the exact same outfit) as the host of this series.  A couple of notes here in that some of the theme music has been changed again (Sting's ""Metallica"" theme changed to his ""crow"" theme, Chris Jericho uses his WWE theme, Hollywood Hogan's ""Voodoo Child"" into a generic version of that) while Michael Buffer's ring announcing & image hasn't been removed unlike the previous sets.

Normally I give my review at the end but I'll leave it here as the usual criticism I have for these sets is that they caught some memorable moments here while still leaving out some important ones but this volume does that more than the previous two as I see no justification in not having Arn Anderson's emotional retirement speech while moments like Hall & Nash diving in a swimming pool & the first verbal confrontation between Savage & DDP when they had better & more memorable confrontations on the show plus I wasn't a big fan of the whole nWo Monday Nitro segment where they took close to 20 minutes to tear down the set only to have another long promo segment dedicating the night to Hogan.  Same goes for the matches as well as some of these were picked for name value only but were nothing more than clusters & easily forgettable while others made question ""what was the point of that?"" when again quality matches are still left on the cutting room floor (I remember one lucha libre crusierweight match where Juvi was sent into the crowd landing on a fan in the front row, another Juvi/Kidman match from that same era that was probably their most physical encounter, the forgotten Hogan/Giant match before Souled Out '98 where Giant got a clean pinfall win, one of the Sting/Flair matches from 1999, we got Sting's title win from DDP on a previous set but still missing the four way where he lost it later in the night, Flair's last World Championship victory, and after the influx of the Network & Mysterio no longer under contract that I think we can finally start showing the matches without his mask).  The positives I can say is that with this being the third volume is that we got some performances from some of the high to mid-card talent that constantly gets overshadowed & forgotten about (Johnny B. Badd, Kidman, Booker T, DDP himself, and tons of Bret Hart matches that he was almost the featured star of the set) while I do admit they got some of the important & favorite moments that was forgotten about in the past (like kicking Giant out of the nWo).  In the end, this would definitely be a set I highly recommend to pick up for fans of WCW, the Monday Night War era, or specifically Bret Hart since this is the most that his WCW career has ever been showcased.

Matches include:
Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Luger put his WCW career on the line here as both men started the match off so intense that they locked up & went from the ring to the outside without breaking as Luger used his power along with taking advantage of his surroundings while Savage went aerial in the ring & to the outside while also fighting fire with fire with the ringside environment in a intense physical match that ended with more questions about Luger than there was before the match.
Oct. '95

WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men were trading momentum early exchanging the same holds along with different offense from a springboard position along with a series of counters & reversals as they got equally more competitive as the time went on delivering such impactful holds from a DDT to tombstone piledriver along with having the same offense in mind at the same time as this was a highly competitive encounter between two evenly matched opponents.
Nov. '95

Sting vs. Diamond Dallas Page - DDP got an unfair early advantage as he resorted to various brawling & illegal tactics to keep the advantage while Sting relied on his trademark offense in the ring & even going out over the top to the floor at one point in what was a solid match but good showcasing for DDP at this stage in his career against a top talent.
Jan. '96

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage - Randy Savage played his own set of mind games against Flair coming into the match as he was lead to the ring by an entourage of women (featuring an unnamed Linda Hogan & Debra McMichael) lead by former Horsemen manager Woman who had a strong response to when Flair attempted to relive old times as this match started off mostly on the floor before eventually making it back & staying in the ring with both men exchanging momentum in what was a short & average but entertaining match here memorable for end result.
Jan. '96
[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Collection]

Sister Sherri vs. Madusa - This started out as an interview with Sherri over what happened a week earlier at her wedding only for Madusa to attack her taking this fight to the floor whipping Sherri into the steps & suplexling her out of her shoes only for Sherri to take back the advantage in the ring as this was a very short match but aggressive for what it was as this was definitely about who would be the last woman standing.
Jan. '96

Lex Luger vs. Kevin Nash - Luger recently became the #1 contender for the WCW Championship but Nash made it clear Luger would would have to go through him to get his shot at Hollywood Hogan as Nash had fellow nWo members at ringside who kept causing a distraction whenever Luger started to get the advantage as the match was just a backdrop to the bigger story of who & what came to Luger's aid against the nWo.
Apr. '97

Giant & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Harlem Heat - This was a segment more than anything else as the nWo attacked & completely dominated not just all the participants in the match but anyone else who tried to get involved along with other areas of the show as well.
May '97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Jericho's first title defense since winning the championship only 2 days earlier as he attempted to keep Juvi grounded with submissions & stretches along with other offense such as a backbreaker while Juvi relied on his lucha libre offense of different head scissors & ranas including a counter from a powerbomb into a frankensteiner while also attempting high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off on more than one occasion while Jericho got more aggressive including variations of the powerbomb & a frankensteiner that was heavily impactful in a high impact match that also saw a post match interview that not only saw an interruption but possibly one of the funniest one-liners said in the history of the program.
June '97

Scott Steiner vs. Randy Savage - Savage had Elizabeth in his corner while Scott had his brother Rick in his as Scott was in control with his fast paced offense causing the ""Madness"" to come out of Savage taking a shot at Rick on the outside & using the ringside environment only for Scott to match the intensity with both men fighting in the crowd more than once & executing his trademark suplexes along with a super frankensteiner in what was an intense match that saw Savage bring out a side of Scott that foreshadowed the future ""Big Poppa Pump.""
July '97

WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger - Both teams were going back & forth with each team playing to their strengths hitting one big move only for the other to come back & hit one of their own while the Outsiders continued to use whatever tactics possible from singling out one opposing member & bending the rules to their advantage in a good tag team encounter.
Aug. '97

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Stevie Richards - This was just a quick average match that was only noteworthy of the post match staredown DDP had with someone from his past.
Sept. '97

Eddie Guerrero & Chris Jericho vs. Chavo Guerrero & Dean Malenko - This took place in El Paso, TX which is the the hometown of the Guerreros as Eddie started out very intense only for Chavo to match it countering Eddie's offense into his own along with hitting his own impactful moves on Jericho while Malenko himself picked up his intensity with a shot on one opponent on the apron that knocked him into the outside guardrail head first only to later get a receipt with a missile dropkick directly to the back of his head while he had a submission applied while Jericho kept being his usual ""role model"" self to the point where he still didn't take his crusierweight championship off throughout this highly physical & intense match.
Feb. '98

Juventud Guerrera vs. Kidman - Both men attempted to use high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off well with one man over shooting his target while the other would get caught in mid-air in this very short match that was more about Juvi's issues with another member of the Flock during this time.
May '98

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage - It was during this time that Savage was a member of the newly formed nWo ""red & black"" Wolfpack faction & still wearing a knee brace from his injury while Hogan had his Disciple in his corner as Savage was completely dominate causing Hogan to resort to various dirty tactics & pushing the limits of a disqualification in order to gain the edge in what was an average match between the two but more about who else decided to make an appearance with the issues he had with everyone involved.
May '98

Billy Kidman vs. Scott Hall - It was during this time that Hall was having a drinking problem to the point where Vincent had his cup of booze but refused to give it to him until he won the following match as Hall kept easily toying with Kidman but kept getting distracted asking Vincent for a drink allowing Kidman to keep taking advantage with his speed advantage & aerial assault including a counter to the Outsiders Edge in what was a solid encounter.
Sept. '98

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Kanyon - Raven was in Kaynon's corner as DDP was able to take advantage of mistakes & accidental distractions only for another distraction to finally work in Kaynon's favor as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being the face to face that happened after the match.
Oct. '98

Goldberg vs. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Kevin Nash - Bigelow arrived on the scene targeting Goldberg weeks earlier only for Nash to win his title shot going into Starrcade making this match here with one man showcasing his brains over brawl on multiple occasions by just sitting back & letting the other two fight or forming an alliance to double team one of the other competitors as all three men had moments of interaction with each other such as one big move being executed only for the third man to attack right after as this was a non-stop action brawl between all three men along with one more who had an interest in what was happening.
Dec. '98

Bret Hart vs. Booker T - This was a #1 contenders match for Scott Hall's United States Championship as Booker started out very fast paced causing Bret to keep resorting to tactics trying to break his momentum & slow the pace down such as grounding him & pushing the limits of a disqualification as they continued to trade momentum with Bret targeting an area of the body with submissions & strikes along with other dirty tactics while Booker continued to use his athleticism with various styles of kicks in a very hard fought contest with the only negatives being the distractions during the match from a backstage segment & commentary on other storylines instead of the match itself.
Feb. '99

Goldberg vs. Ric Flair - Hollywood Hogan & Kevin Nash was on commentary for this match as Flair kept trying to get some offense in against Goldberg to no avail as he was literally ""running into a brick wall"" & constantly being overpowered resulting in Flair resorting to using dirty tactics often from going to the eyes to going low & using the ring environment around him to his advantage. This was a different type of match for Goldberg as he faced Flair who resorted to his ways of being ""dirtiest player in the game"" that he never encountered before.
Mar. '99
[Golberg: The Ultimate Collection]

Hollywood Hogan vs. Diamond Dallas Page - It should be noted that this was DDP's first match back from his injury by Scott Steiner, WCW President Ric Flair was in DDP's corner without DDP's approval, and despite being a member of the heelish ""nWo Wolfpack/Elite"" faction that the crowd supported Hogan over DDP.  This started out as a brawl as the match went from the ring to fighting on the announce table to destroying the Nitro set before heading back into the ring using different objects to beat on each other with Flair attempting to get involved in more ways than one only to not keeping getting the reaction he was expecting from both Hogan & DDP as they traded momentum with Hogan using offensive moves such as submissions that we haven't seen from him before in a match that Tony Schavonie said ""will leave you breathless"" to the point where DDP after the match talked about a phone call he received the next day from the WWE Champion asking how he dragged that type of performance out of Hogan.
Mar. '99

Sting vs. Randy Savage - This match started out of control from the very start with an unusual distraction allowing Savage to dominate right from the start working over Sting in the ring & around ringside with brawling & illegal tactics while his valets in Team Madness having no issues getting physical themselves multiple times as this match only got more out of control with anyone getting in the way ending up getting taken out themselves as Bobby Heenan defined this encounter perfectly on commentary, ""Savage is exactly that...A SAVAGE!""
June '99
[Best Of Sting]

Hardcore Match: Hak vs. Rick Steiner - Rick Steiner came out in street clothes as this fight didn't stay in the ring long making it's way backstage quickly with anyone who was in their way getting nailed as both men used whatever they had around them while dismantling cars in the process in what was an out of control brawl with quite the visual of who decided to thrown whom into a camper trailer & what happened.
June '99

Sting & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious - Nash had a mystery partner in Sid while there was some clear tension between Hogan & Sting just based off their past but worked well together staying one step ahead of their opponents while Nash & Sid singled out one individual using whatever tactics they could to keep the advantage in their favor in a solid tag match that was more about who else decided to get involved in the fight & which team was left standing.
July '99

New York Evening Gown Match: Madusa vs. Mona - As a side note for those who don't know or remember, Mona is better known as ex-WWE Womens Champion Molly Holly as Madusa was forced into this match she didn't want any part of by the new ""Powers That Be"" to the point where she didn't even wear an evening gown as Mona tried to wrestle only for Madusa to take her aggression out on her along with getting in the face of anyone who was going along with the match in any capacity as this was more of a segment than an actual match.
Oct. '99

WCW Champion Sting vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.
Oct. '99
[Sting: Into The Light]

Ladder Match w/special referee - Kevin Nash: WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs. Bret Hart vs. Scott Hall vs. Sid Vicious - You knew the direction this match was going when two of the participants started brawling before the other two made their entrances before the mystery referee in Kevin Nash came down to ringside with the ladder as this was nothing more than a quick four way brawl that saw more than one person get involved in the action as this was more of a segment than a ""match"" as this all about screwing over more than one person in favor of another.
Nov. '99

WCW Champion Bret Hart vs. Jeff Jarrett - Jarrett walked out wearing Bret's championship belt with Creative Control at ringside as we saw Bret be more aggressive than usual from the start as he resorted to brawling tactics from fighting on the floor to low blow & raking eyes across the ropes while Jarrett gave it all right back to him as they went back & forth in what was a physical brawl.
Nov. '99

Texas Tornado Match: Sting & Vampiro vs. Lex Luger & Ric Flair - Sting & Vampiro started this match off with a bang as one set of opponents stayed fighting in the ring while the other set fought from the stage area to the swimming pool area to the beach into the actual Gulf Of Mexico using whatever they could get their hands on such as ranch dip & salsa to surfboards (I can't make this up) in a match that I can only describe in one word: FUN!
Mar. '00

WCW Champion Booker T vs. Mike Awesome - This was Booker's first title defense as Awesome dominated with his power along & crusierweight ability while also taking shortcuts using weapons on the outside only for Booker T to match him with his aerial ability & even taking advantage of his surroundings setup by Awesome at one point with the bigger story behind not only who decided to attack afterwords but who saved whom from the attack but be sure to watch this match on mute as the commentators were too busy doing a subliminal burial of a specific person on commentary that it heavily distracted from the match.
July '00

WCW Tag Team Champions Mark Jindrak & Sean OHaire vs. Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - One team was very dominate in the beginning causing them to become the odd team out with the two opponents working together to take them out of the match using double teaming & high flying offense before focusing on each other as this match in what was a non-stop fast paced tag match with a new alliance formed in the aftermath.
Nov. '00

Booker T & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that both Steiners held the top two singles championships (Scott as World & Rick as U.S.) with both men set to meet their opponents in title matches at the upcoming Greed PPV as this started out as a brawl with the Steiners constantly resorting to illegal tactics such as blind tags & double teaming along with taking advantage of the environment not just outside but backstage while DDP & Booker put up a strong fight themselves with not just their wrestling but throwing fist & getting aggressive themselves in a solid tag team encounter.
Mar. '01

(Blu-Ray) WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Steiner Brothers - Kevin Nash was out with knee surgery causing Syxx to defend his half of the championship as the Steiners used their power advantage to while Hall & Syxx relied on quick tags & double teaming along with taking some shortcuts that caused more than one person to have a response to in what was a nice back & forth tag team encounter.
Oct. '97

(Blu-Ray) Kanyon vs. Raven - The match started before both men got in the ring being very physical to the point where one attempted move landed both men on the outside as they took advantage of ""Raven's Rules"" utilizing their environment & whatever weapon they could get their hands on along with members of The Flock getting involved but this was more about another man who had issues with both men making his presence known as well.
July '98

(Blu-Ray) WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Lex Luger - Luger showcased his superior power early causing Bret to keep using the same tactic to break the momentum only for Luger to adapt & used a different strategy to avoid that happening before Bret was able to heavily target an area of the body to neutralize Luger's power using his wrestling ability & dirty tactics which didn't always work in his favor in a solid encounter.
Aug. '98

(Blu-Ray) Bret Hart vs. Hollywood Hogan - Don't judge a book by it's cover here because this match is advertised as the first (and to my knowledge, ONLY) ""Hogan vs. Hart"" match but was nothing more than a segment as Hart heavily hurt his knee causing nWo Wolfpack to help him get medical help while Sting (who Bret had formed an alliance with weeks earlier) took his place in the match only for Hogan's nWo stable to attack the Wolfpack in the back leading to Hart turning on Sting & beating him down in the ring with the assistance of Hogan.

(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting - Sting came out very intense from the start taking the fight to Jarrett from the outside all the way to the stage area with Jarrett gaining control due to a mistiming heavily focusing on a part of the body using whatever he could in a quick but intense match that came down to someone having unfinished business.
May '00

(Blu-Ray) WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash vs. Scott Steiner vs. Goldberg - One of the participants was attacked backstage making this a glorified handicap with two of the participants singling out the other using double teaming & just beating on him one at a time with another person getting involved in the action as well as this was pretty much a huge cluster that was about ""strength in numbers"" that's really only remember for one of the rare matches Goldberg had being a heel at that time.
June '00

Other moments include Sting confronting Rick Steiner, The Giant getting kicked out of the nWo, a verbal confrontation between DDP & Randy Savage, highlights of nWo Monday Nitro, nWo attempts to recruit Rick Steiner, Giant tossing Scott Hall into a pool, Lex Luger joined the Wolfpack, Hollywood Hogan calls out DDP & Karl Malone, Giant chokeslamming DDP through the Nitro stage while Ric Flair confronting Bret Hart & nWo Wolfpack flipping nWo Hollywood's limo is on the Blu-Ray.

I already gave my summary at the beginning but again, it's a set I would pick up but not before the previous two volumes.",1439769600,4,22247,4.542436345481778
7120265,4,B00W5JQ3FU,"Back by popular demand is another volume of ""Best Of WCW Monday Nitro"" with Diamond Dallas Page once again returning (looking like he wore the exact same outfit) as the host of this series.  A couple of notes here in that some of the theme music has been changed again (Sting's ""Metallica"" theme changed to his ""crow"" theme, Chris Jericho uses his WWE theme, Hollywood Hogan's ""Voodoo Child"" into a generic version of that) while Michael Buffer's ring announcing & image hasn't been removed unlike the previous sets.

Normally I give my review at the end but I'll leave it here as the usual criticism I have for these sets is that they caught some memorable moments here while still leaving out some important ones but this volume does that more than the previous two as I see no justification in not having Arn Anderson's emotional retirement speech while moments like Hall & Nash diving in a swimming pool & the first verbal confrontation between Savage & DDP when they had better & more memorable confrontations on the show plus I wasn't a big fan of the whole nWo Monday Nitro segment where they took close to 20 minutes to tear down the set only to have another long promo segment dedicating the night to Hogan.  Same goes for the matches as well as some of these were picked for name value only but were nothing more than clusters & easily forgettable while others made question ""what was the point of that?"" when again quality matches are still left on the cutting room floor (I remember one lucha libre crusierweight match where Juvi was sent into the crowd landing on a fan in the front row, another Juvi/Kidman match from that same era that was probably their most physical encounter, the forgotten Hogan/Giant match before Souled Out '98 where Giant got a clean pinfall win, one of the Sting/Flair matches from 1999, we got Sting's title win from DDP on a previous set but still missing the four way where he lost it later in the night, Flair's last World Championship victory, and after the influx of the Network & Mysterio no longer under contract that I think we can finally start showing the matches without his mask).  The positives I can say is that with this being the third volume is that we got some performances from some of the high to mid-card talent that constantly gets overshadowed & forgotten about (Johnny B. Badd, Kidman, Booker T, DDP himself, and tons of Bret Hart matches that he was almost the featured star of the set) while I do admit they got some of the important & favorite moments that was forgotten about in the past (like kicking Giant out of the nWo).  In the end, this would definitely be a set I highly recommend to pick up for fans of WCW, the Monday Night War era, or specifically Bret Hart since this is the most that his WCW career has ever been showcased.

Matches include:
Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Luger put his WCW career on the line here as both men started the match off so intense that they locked up & went from the ring to the outside without breaking as Luger used his power along with taking advantage of his surroundings while Savage went aerial in the ring & to the outside while also fighting fire with fire with the ringside environment in a intense physical match that ended with more questions about Luger than there was before the match.
Oct. '95

WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Eddie Guerrero - Both men were trading momentum early exchanging the same holds along with different offense from a springboard position along with a series of counters & reversals as they got equally more competitive as the time went on delivering such impactful holds from a DDT to tombstone piledriver along with having the same offense in mind at the same time as this was a highly competitive encounter between two evenly matched opponents.
Nov. '95

Sting vs. Diamond Dallas Page - DDP got an unfair early advantage as he resorted to various brawling & illegal tactics to keep the advantage while Sting relied on his trademark offense in the ring & even going out over the top to the floor at one point in what was a solid match but good showcasing for DDP at this stage in his career against a top talent.
Jan. '96

WCW Champion Ric Flair vs. Randy Savage - Randy Savage played his own set of mind games against Flair coming into the match as he was lead to the ring by an entourage of women (featuring an unnamed Linda Hogan & Debra McMichael) lead by former Horsemen manager Woman who had a strong response to when Flair attempted to relive old times as this match started off mostly on the floor before eventually making it back & staying in the ring with both men exchanging momentum in what was a short & average but entertaining match here memorable for end result.
Jan. '96
[Macho Madness: The Randy Savage Collection]

Sister Sherri vs. Madusa - This started out as an interview with Sherri over what happened a week earlier at her wedding only for Madusa to attack her taking this fight to the floor whipping Sherri into the steps & suplexling her out of her shoes only for Sherri to take back the advantage in the ring as this was a very short match but aggressive for what it was as this was definitely about who would be the last woman standing.
Jan. '96

Lex Luger vs. Kevin Nash - Luger recently became the #1 contender for the WCW Championship but Nash made it clear Luger would would have to go through him to get his shot at Hollywood Hogan as Nash had fellow nWo members at ringside who kept causing a distraction whenever Luger started to get the advantage as the match was just a backdrop to the bigger story of who & what came to Luger's aid against the nWo.
Apr. '97

Giant & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Harlem Heat - This was a segment more than anything else as the nWo attacked & completely dominated not just all the participants in the match but anyone else who tried to get involved along with other areas of the show as well.
May '97

WCW Cruiserweight Champion Chris Jericho vs. Juventud Guerrera - Jericho's first title defense since winning the championship only 2 days earlier as he attempted to keep Juvi grounded with submissions & stretches along with other offense such as a backbreaker while Juvi relied on his lucha libre offense of different head scissors & ranas including a counter from a powerbomb into a frankensteiner while also attempting high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off on more than one occasion while Jericho got more aggressive including variations of the powerbomb & a frankensteiner that was heavily impactful in a high impact match that also saw a post match interview that not only saw an interruption but possibly one of the funniest one-liners said in the history of the program.
June '97

Scott Steiner vs. Randy Savage - Savage had Elizabeth in his corner while Scott had his brother Rick in his as Scott was in control with his fast paced offense causing the ""Madness"" to come out of Savage taking a shot at Rick on the outside & using the ringside environment only for Scott to match the intensity with both men fighting in the crowd more than once & executing his trademark suplexes along with a super frankensteiner in what was an intense match that saw Savage bring out a side of Scott that foreshadowed the future ""Big Poppa Pump.""
July '97

WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger - Both teams were going back & forth with each team playing to their strengths hitting one big move only for the other to come back & hit one of their own while the Outsiders continued to use whatever tactics possible from singling out one opposing member & bending the rules to their advantage in a good tag team encounter.
Aug. '97

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Stevie Richards - This was just a quick average match that was only noteworthy of the post match staredown DDP had with someone from his past.
Sept. '97

Eddie Guerrero & Chris Jericho vs. Chavo Guerrero & Dean Malenko - This took place in El Paso, TX which is the the hometown of the Guerreros as Eddie started out very intense only for Chavo to match it countering Eddie's offense into his own along with hitting his own impactful moves on Jericho while Malenko himself picked up his intensity with a shot on one opponent on the apron that knocked him into the outside guardrail head first only to later get a receipt with a missile dropkick directly to the back of his head while he had a submission applied while Jericho kept being his usual ""role model"" self to the point where he still didn't take his crusierweight championship off throughout this highly physical & intense match.
Feb. '98

Juventud Guerrera vs. Kidman - Both men attempted to use high risk maneuvers that didn't pay off well with one man over shooting his target while the other would get caught in mid-air in this very short match that was more about Juvi's issues with another member of the Flock during this time.
May '98

WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Randy Savage - It was during this time that Savage was a member of the newly formed nWo ""red & black"" Wolfpack faction & still wearing a knee brace from his injury while Hogan had his Disciple in his corner as Savage was completely dominate causing Hogan to resort to various dirty tactics & pushing the limits of a disqualification in order to gain the edge in what was an average match between the two but more about who else decided to make an appearance with the issues he had with everyone involved.
May '98

Billy Kidman vs. Scott Hall - It was during this time that Hall was having a drinking problem to the point where Vincent had his cup of booze but refused to give it to him until he won the following match as Hall kept easily toying with Kidman but kept getting distracted asking Vincent for a drink allowing Kidman to keep taking advantage with his speed advantage & aerial assault including a counter to the Outsiders Edge in what was a solid encounter.
Sept. '98

Diamond Dallas Page vs. Kanyon - Raven was in Kaynon's corner as DDP was able to take advantage of mistakes & accidental distractions only for another distraction to finally work in Kaynon's favor as they traded momentum throughout the contest with the bigger story being the face to face that happened after the match.
Oct. '98

Goldberg vs. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Kevin Nash - Bigelow arrived on the scene targeting Goldberg weeks earlier only for Nash to win his title shot going into Starrcade making this match here with one man showcasing his brains over brawl on multiple occasions by just sitting back & letting the other two fight or forming an alliance to double team one of the other competitors as all three men had moments of interaction with each other such as one big move being executed only for the third man to attack right after as this was a non-stop action brawl between all three men along with one more who had an interest in what was happening.
Dec. '98

Bret Hart vs. Booker T - This was a #1 contenders match for Scott Hall's United States Championship as Booker started out very fast paced causing Bret to keep resorting to tactics trying to break his momentum & slow the pace down such as grounding him & pushing the limits of a disqualification as they continued to trade momentum with Bret targeting an area of the body with submissions & strikes along with other dirty tactics while Booker continued to use his athleticism with various styles of kicks in a very hard fought contest with the only negatives being the distractions during the match from a backstage segment & commentary on other storylines instead of the match itself.
Feb. '99

Goldberg vs. Ric Flair - Hollywood Hogan & Kevin Nash was on commentary for this match as Flair kept trying to get some offense in against Goldberg to no avail as he was literally ""running into a brick wall"" & constantly being overpowered resulting in Flair resorting to using dirty tactics often from going to the eyes to going low & using the ring environment around him to his advantage. This was a different type of match for Goldberg as he faced Flair who resorted to his ways of being ""dirtiest player in the game"" that he never encountered before.
Mar. '99
[Golberg: The Ultimate Collection]

Hollywood Hogan vs. Diamond Dallas Page - It should be noted that this was DDP's first match back from his injury by Scott Steiner, WCW President Ric Flair was in DDP's corner without DDP's approval, and despite being a member of the heelish ""nWo Wolfpack/Elite"" faction that the crowd supported Hogan over DDP.  This started out as a brawl as the match went from the ring to fighting on the announce table to destroying the Nitro set before heading back into the ring using different objects to beat on each other with Flair attempting to get involved in more ways than one only to not keeping getting the reaction he was expecting from both Hogan & DDP as they traded momentum with Hogan using offensive moves such as submissions that we haven't seen from him before in a match that Tony Schavonie said ""will leave you breathless"" to the point where DDP after the match talked about a phone call he received the next day from the WWE Champion asking how he dragged that type of performance out of Hogan.
Mar. '99

Sting vs. Randy Savage - This match started out of control from the very start with an unusual distraction allowing Savage to dominate right from the start working over Sting in the ring & around ringside with brawling & illegal tactics while his valets in Team Madness having no issues getting physical themselves multiple times as this match only got more out of control with anyone getting in the way ending up getting taken out themselves as Bobby Heenan defined this encounter perfectly on commentary, ""Savage is exactly that...A SAVAGE!""
June '99
[Best Of Sting]

Hardcore Match: Hak vs. Rick Steiner - Rick Steiner came out in street clothes as this fight didn't stay in the ring long making it's way backstage quickly with anyone who was in their way getting nailed as both men used whatever they had around them while dismantling cars in the process in what was an out of control brawl with quite the visual of who decided to thrown whom into a camper trailer & what happened.
June '99

Sting & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious - Nash had a mystery partner in Sid while there was some clear tension between Hogan & Sting just based off their past but worked well together staying one step ahead of their opponents while Nash & Sid singled out one individual using whatever tactics they could to keep the advantage in their favor in a solid tag match that was more about who else decided to get involved in the fight & which team was left standing.
July '99

New York Evening Gown Match: Madusa vs. Mona - As a side note for those who don't know or remember, Mona is better known as ex-WWE Womens Champion Molly Holly as Madusa was forced into this match she didn't want any part of by the new ""Powers That Be"" to the point where she didn't even wear an evening gown as Mona tried to wrestle only for Madusa to take her aggression out on her along with getting in the face of anyone who was going along with the match in any capacity as this was more of a segment than an actual match.
Oct. '99

WCW Champion Sting vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret Hart's first WCW Championship match (to my knowledge) despite being in the company for close to 2 years as Bret took the offense to Sting right away with punches & bouncing his head off various items on the floor only for Sting to resort to desperate tactics & giving a receipt using the ringside environment to his advantage as they went back & forth using their trademark offense against each other resulting in a match that got more aggressive over time.
Oct. '99
[Sting: Into The Light]

Ladder Match w/special referee - Kevin Nash: WCW United States Champion Goldberg vs. Bret Hart vs. Scott Hall vs. Sid Vicious - You knew the direction this match was going when two of the participants started brawling before the other two made their entrances before the mystery referee in Kevin Nash came down to ringside with the ladder as this was nothing more than a quick four way brawl that saw more than one person get involved in the action as this was more of a segment than a ""match"" as this all about screwing over more than one person in favor of another.
Nov. '99

WCW Champion Bret Hart vs. Jeff Jarrett - Jarrett walked out wearing Bret's championship belt with Creative Control at ringside as we saw Bret be more aggressive than usual from the start as he resorted to brawling tactics from fighting on the floor to low blow & raking eyes across the ropes while Jarrett gave it all right back to him as they went back & forth in what was a physical brawl.
Nov. '99

Texas Tornado Match: Sting & Vampiro vs. Lex Luger & Ric Flair - Sting & Vampiro started this match off with a bang as one set of opponents stayed fighting in the ring while the other set fought from the stage area to the swimming pool area to the beach into the actual Gulf Of Mexico using whatever they could get their hands on such as ranch dip & salsa to surfboards (I can't make this up) in a match that I can only describe in one word: FUN!
Mar. '00

WCW Champion Booker T vs. Mike Awesome - This was Booker's first title defense as Awesome dominated with his power along & crusierweight ability while also taking shortcuts using weapons on the outside only for Booker T to match him with his aerial ability & even taking advantage of his surroundings setup by Awesome at one point with the bigger story behind not only who decided to attack afterwords but who saved whom from the attack but be sure to watch this match on mute as the commentators were too busy doing a subliminal burial of a specific person on commentary that it heavily distracted from the match.
July '00

WCW Tag Team Champions Mark Jindrak & Sean OHaire vs. Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - One team was very dominate in the beginning causing them to become the odd team out with the two opponents working together to take them out of the match using double teaming & high flying offense before focusing on each other as this match in what was a non-stop fast paced tag match with a new alliance formed in the aftermath.
Nov. '00

Booker T & Diamond Dallas Page vs. Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that both Steiners held the top two singles championships (Scott as World & Rick as U.S.) with both men set to meet their opponents in title matches at the upcoming Greed PPV as this started out as a brawl with the Steiners constantly resorting to illegal tactics such as blind tags & double teaming along with taking advantage of the environment not just outside but backstage while DDP & Booker put up a strong fight themselves with not just their wrestling but throwing fist & getting aggressive themselves in a solid tag team encounter.
Mar. '01

(Blu-Ray) WCW Tag Team Champions Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Steiner Brothers - Kevin Nash was out with knee surgery causing Syxx to defend his half of the championship as the Steiners used their power advantage to while Hall & Syxx relied on quick tags & double teaming along with taking some shortcuts that caused more than one person to have a response to in what was a nice back & forth tag team encounter.
Oct. '97

(Blu-Ray) Kanyon vs. Raven - The match started before both men got in the ring being very physical to the point where one attempted move landed both men on the outside as they took advantage of ""Raven's Rules"" ulilizing their environment & whatever weapon they could get their hands on along with members of The Flock getting involved but this was more about another man who had issues with both men making his presence known as well.
July '98

(Blu-Ray) WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Lex Luger - Luger showcased his superior power early causing Bret to keep using the same tactic to break the momentum only for Luger to adapt & used a different strategy to avoid that happening before Bret was able to heavily target an area of the body to neutralize Luger's power using his wrestling ability & dirty tactics which didn't always work in his favor in a solid encounter.
Aug. '98

(Blu-Ray) Bret Hart vs. Hollywood Hogan - Don't judge a book by it's cover here because this match is advertised as the first (and to my knowledge, ONLY) ""Hogan vs. Hart"" match but was nothing more than a segment as Hart heavily hurt his knee causing nWo Wolfpack to help him get medical help while Sting (who Bret had formed an alliance with weeks earlier) took his place in the match only for Hogan's nWo stable to attack the Wolfpack in the back leading to Hart turning on Sting & beating him down in the ring with the assistance of Hogan.
