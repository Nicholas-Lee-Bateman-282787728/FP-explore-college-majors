8488066,5,B005WSDN1I,"Love, love, love this movie. So much so, this is my second copy in case anything happens to the first! I've been watching Bollywood since getting introduced to it in 2006 so I think I can say that this is a feel-good romance, with amusing moments. No dramatic action, no big production item numbers, just a romantic movie that feels like we're getting a peek into the lives of some middle class people who are just minding their own business, figuring out their lives and learning to listen to their hearts. If you want to smile and have a distraction from your day, put on this comfort movie, laugh and dance during the great Rab Rakha number, maybe commit to those guitar lessons, and, again, smile.... :-)",1503705600,,708,4.582677165354331

I had already watched it a couple of times from my video streaming  provider. I love watching Hindi movies and this one is a keeper!",1394236800,,252,4.319148936170213

And I was happily surprised to find this film very charming. It had a good message, had wonderful actors, and was very well made film. I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy sweet love stories.",1334880000,,360,4.084507042253521
