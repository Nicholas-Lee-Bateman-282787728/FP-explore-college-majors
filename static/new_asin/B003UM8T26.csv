8620929,3,B003UM8T26,The overall boxset is good but the way it came it kinda sucked with dents on the box and a holder of the disc broken. With the cost of shipping it too Canada it a downer with how much it cost. The actually box set is good though it's a fun keepsake from a great mma org like WEC.,1472601600,,279,3.7457627118644066

BEST OF WEC

The WEC was one of the greatest promotions of all time that started with all weight classes. Soon the Zuffa Company which owns the UFC bought them out and made it a show with Lightweight and below fights. This ended up creating one of the most exciting promotions of all time. Honestly there was never a bad event, ever. This is a best of DVD/Blu-Ray with some of the greatest fights in MMA history.

Spoilers

1. MIGUEL TORRES VS TAKEYA MIZUGAKI-this was a Bantamweight Title fight pitting two of the best fighters in WEC history against each other. The first round is excellent with both guys coming aggressively and swinging for the fences. Both throw some technical shots but mix in some heavy ones as well. The second round is just as exciting with both coming hard once again. There are some great shots landed in this round including some great knees. The third round is more of the same which is a good thing, the action picks up even more though towards the end. The fourth round is full of even more action with great combinations and flurries. Round 5 was another classic round with both guys going back and forth. When one would come forward the other would fire back, Torres keeps the belt in this classic. 5/5

2. ROB MCCULLOUGH VS DONALD CERRONE-the first round here is amazing and full of action. At first Rob was dancing all around and landing back to back, even dropping Cerrone. But soon Rob gets dropped twice and dominated on the ground, he does at one point sweep Cerrone though. The second round was just as amazing with Rob getting dropped again but even after Donald takes his back he still gets on top. After escaping an arm bar Rob gets back up and the action stays quick. The third round features more stand up even though Cerrone gets an early take down, he also takes the fight by UD.5/5

3. JENS PULVER VS URIJAH FABER-I remember when this fight happened I was all about it, Jens Pulver aka Lil Evil is one of my favorite fighters. This was for the Featherweight title and Pulver and Faber were both on a roll. The first round of this still makes me worry like it is new, Faber looks really good with his stand up. I thought for sure Jens would KO him if they stayed on the feet. The second round was excellent as it was back and forth the entire time. At first Faber seems like he is going to dominate the stand up and even rocks Pulver. But Jens comes from no where to start unloading on him and then they go back and forth. The third follows suit with great back and forth action full of fists. I would also like to point out that Frank Mir is great in commentary here. The following round features both landing some good shots but Faber getting a take down and controlling from there. The final round is just as exciting making this an epic battle that was close but Faber clearly won this one. 5/5

4. MIGUEL TORRES VS YOSHIRO MAEDA-this fight for the Bantamweight title is insane and the first round proves it. This is a dog fight and like Frank says more like a street fight. Torres gets bloody but both swing for the fences. Honestly this is one of the greatest fights of all time and round two gets even better than round one. Fists flying and knees and kicks coming at full force, at one point they had each other in leg locks. Insane fight is all one could say about this battle. Round three sees Maeda and Torres just do battle, that is the best way to say it. But after the round the doctors call the fight due to Maeda's right eye being swollen shut. 5/5

5. MIKE BROWN VS URIJAH FABER-I remember when we were watching this live I just knew Faber would not beat Brown. The first round was very even with both guys coming to deliver with both guys landing. Also just so you know Faber breaks his hand some where in round 2 or 3. With that said Brown looked great in the second round hunting Faber down, but Faber still hangs in there. But Faber still landed some nice elbows. The third round sees the action go a little back and forth with Faber getting a take down but Brown lands the heavier shots. The next round sees Brown continue his head hunting and Faber landing some nice elbows. The final round in this rematch for the Featherweight title would see Faber almost pull it off with a choke that looked like he might get. But Brown retains the title after five great rounds of non stop action. 5/5

6. DONALD CERRONE VS BEN HENDERSON-this fight here would go down as not only one of the best fights in WEC history but in MMA history. I remember watching this live and thinking man these two are two of the best in the world. This event took place in San Antonio Texas and what a great night it was. This fight was for the Lightweight title and they went at it like champions should. The first round was full of great submission attempts and escapes and great ground and pound. The second round sees both guys spend most of the time on the ground once again. Henderson lets loose with ground and pound, and Cerrone throws up some submissions. The third round is full of action with Ben coming out on top most of the time, but still very close. In round four Cerrone comes back strong locking in submissions and defending the takedowns wonderfully. The final round is incredible with Cerrone locking in submission after submission but never being able to finish Henderson. Ben takes the win and the title but this was one great fight. 5/5

Special features include a behind the scenes for Faber vs Pulver as well as [only on Blu-Ray] a press conference for Torres vs Maeda and weigh-ins for Cerrone vs Henderson.",1310083200,2,5577,4.401551891367604
8620934,3,B003UM8T26,"All of the Fights on this Disc are amazing. The fact that there is only 6 fights left me wanting more. The WEC had so many incredible fights that limiting it to 6 seems like a mockery.
It would be great if there was an opportunity to buy the complete events or if more fights were offered.
Worth buying but 6 fights is just not enough....",1290124800,5,338,4.136363636363637
8620935,3,B003UM8T26,"1st off, these are all very good fights featuring very good fighters.  Why only 3 stars?  Because this disc really seems like it's trying to push the faces of the organization rather than the best fighters or most exciting moments of the past 2 years.  Torres & Faber are great, but neither has held the belt in over a year & a half.  Why not highlight the current champions (incl. Ben Henderson)?  Or give more time to Mike Brown, who has beaten Faber twice?  Or include some shorter fights?  or highlight reels?  Good fights, just some curious selections.  Even though this is a ""best of,"" I think the Aldo v. Faber DVD is just as good & would recommend that as well.",1284508800,7,669,4.418032786885246
8620936,4,B003UM8T26,"This is a great 1 disk DVD. There are 6 fights on here and all of them are great.

That said 5 of them go the distance and most of them are championship bouts. Think Griffin vs. Bonner at the end of The Ultimate Fighter Season 1. Only WEC fighters are smaller, faster and much more skilled.

A little variety would have made this DVD better. If they took out 1 of the 5 rounders and put 2 or 3 fights were somebody got finished in between them it would have been a better overall viewing experience. I watched this DVD over 2-3 days instead of all at once as a result.

Still, I'm hoping this is Vol. 1 of the Best of WEC and more is on the way.",1284249600,,645,3.9461538461538463
8620937,5,B003UM8T26,"This DVD collection of some of the best fights that the WEC has to offer is a great introduction for the sister promotion of the UFC to fans who may not have been following mixed martial arts that long. The WEC consistently puts on some of the best MMA events and they have some of the most exciting fighters around. These are the guys that rule the lighter weight classes and the result is some of the fastest and most furious bouts in MMA history that end with explosive knockouts and some slick submission finishes. If you are just getting into MMA and want to expand your horizons beyond the UFC, this DVD is a great way to start. Or, if you are an MMA fan and have been for years, then this is a must own for your MMA DVD collection. You won't be disappointed.",1283817600,2,765,4.2465753424657535
