4429188,5,B004M9QNY2,Great information; absolutely fascinating. Just goes to show that you cannot trust what you are taught in school about our history. It opens up the mind to many possibilities. Really enjoyed it and I intend to watch it again so as not to forget!,1394928000,,245,4.590909090909091
4429189,5,B004M9QNY2,This is a great find for a world history teacher who wants students to understand there is more than one story about the discovery of America.  This is great for AP World History students to help them explore the travels of others across the globe!,1374451200,4,248,4.511111111111111
4429190,1,B004M9QNY2,"The doc allocated about one minute to Native crossings along an 18,000 year old Siberian-Alaskan ice bridge. Nothing about subsequent repeated Native crossings either on land or by water and extending as far as South America. The rest of the doc is focused on inferences covering the past couple of thousand years and were often based on a singular questionable written reference or a singular ambiguous artifact and location. A case for Aliens could just as easily have been made given that one can rationalize an ordered pattern in any set of random data. If only those Natives had been resource devouring capitalists the outcome would have been different.",1326758400,6,658,5.045871559633028
4429191,5,B004M9QNY2,"So, if it wasn't Columbus, then who did discover America? This documentary gives good reasons for you to believe it was the Chinese, the Japanese, the Irish, the ancient Hebrews and others, too. Very Interesting. You will probably watch it more than once.",1318291200,9,255,4.953488372093023
4429192,3,B004M9QNY2,"As a professional archaeologist I've taught a critical thinking course, Lost Tribes, Sunken Continents, and Ancient Astronauts, for more than three decades. I seek out videos that make fantastic claims about the past and that demonstrate all the principles of poor argumentation and reasoning that Sagan raised in his ""Baloney Detection Kit"" chapter in Demon-Haunted World. Such videos have been showing up more and more often on the History Channel. In spite of its leading-question title, this 2010 video, ""Who Really Discovered America?,"" is surprisingly good in straightforwardly presenting the various legends and speculations about Pre-Columbian expeditions to the Americas, but the video makers want too badly to have you believe there were many such ""discoveries."" Most archaeologists accept only the Norse presence in Newfoundland, but as is often the case, archaeologists get criticized for not accepting the scanty evidence for others.  Archaeologists, however, follow strict rules for evidence: 1. Artifacts need to be found in undisturbed contexts; 2. Evidence has to be unequivocal (extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof!); and 3. Following Occam's Razor, the simplest explanation is  probably better than more complex explanations. For example, upon finding some Roman coins  near the Falls of The Ohio, saying some Romans came to the middle of North America may sound simple, but getting them there at 25 A.D. to drop the coins is really very complicated. Having some kid lose a few coins from his collection as he walked along the Ohio River in 1924 isn't. Strict rules of evidence make archaeologists very conservative regarding speculative claims. Some early transoceanic crossings? Probably more than we know, but show us good evidence! If there were lots of folks crossing the oceans regularly, there would be plenty. Watch this video, but with a critical eye. Now, about the new Ancient Astronauts series...",1317340800,18,1939,5.478260869565218
4429193,4,B004M9QNY2,"When I went to school, it was drummed into me that Columbus discovered America, ""1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue"".

Archeology has moved on since then, now the argument that just about every region of the world had made contact with America before Columbus is put and well evidenced on this dvd.

I recommend it as enjoyable, well produced, and worth viewing.",1314835200,8,364,4.854838709677419
8435817,5,B004M9QNY2,"What a great documentary. It never gives a definite answer, but offers lots of perspectives and possible evidence.  Really a great way to get students thinking for themselves and making history real.",1516752000,,199,5.21875
8435818,4,B004M9QNY2,I use this in my class room (US History 8th grade) to discuss if we should still have a Columbus Day the students really like to conersation and the activities.,1509753600,,160,4.366666666666666
8435819,4,B004M9QNY2,"This considers loads of circumstantial evidence and mathematical possibilities to share a number of people groups could perhaps have located the North/South American Continent. Occasionally insightful, beautiful scenery.",1474588800,,220,6.892857142857143
8435820,5,B004M9QNY2,"The film itself performed perfectly and was in excellent shape thus living up to its description.
The content of the film was exactly what I expected.
So I am a happy camper.",1433289600,,174,4.46875
8435821,3,B004M9QNY2,"I have to agree with the other, more critical, review for this. I watched this program on H2 the other night, and debated buying it to show clips from for the students in my Early American History class (we have a unit addressing what 'discovery' actually means in context of the Americas).

I was immediately skeptical when one of the first 'discoverers' profiled was Chinese explorer Zheng He - while Zheng He very likely rounded the horn of Africa, it is highly unlikely that he made it to the American continents. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the narration explained that there was actually little hard evidence for this theory of discovery. The rest of the program continued in this vein - proposing a possible 'discoverer' or group of 'discoverers', providing the evidence (very slim in most places), but then, in most cases, explaining why this is probably not the case.

The one big issue I have with this program, and why I would not show the entire thing to my class, is that the final conclusion of the program is that 'more cultures have discovered the Americas than you would think', and this simply isn't true. While the program has great clips about the Polynesians and Vikings (both with harder evidence, and in the case of the Vikings, a permanent settlement) all of the other supposed 'discoverers' are either couched in legend, or based on very little hard evidence.

Overall positives: It does explain why most of these theories are not given credence by historians, and it has some very good material about the Polynesians and Vikings, as well as the Clovis culture of the Americas.

Overall negatives: Simply not enough hard evidence to make the other sections worth watching.",1415145600,3,1710,4.865979381443299

8435824,4,B004M9QNY2,"An interesting documentary covering all (or most) of the theories surrounding pre-Columbian voyages to North America.  As a viewer, I wish that the film spent more time on discussing Phoenician activity since the Phoenicians were great seafarers and made documented sea voyages to what is now Britain and also circumnavigated the African continent.  Be that as it may, the film attempts to discuss all the major discovery theories and does a fairly good job in doing so.",1404518400,3,470,5.090909090909091
