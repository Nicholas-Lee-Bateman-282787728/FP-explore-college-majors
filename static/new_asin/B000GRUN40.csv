2616087,5,B000GRUN40,"This KATT, lol, is on fire... He is HILLARIOUS and his calm demeanor is extremely appealing... He has a very unique comedy style, EFFORTLESS!!!! He pulls laugh after laugh after laugh... It's hard to REVIEW comedians b/c everyone has a different take on what ""FUNNY"" is but I'll say this - if this KATT does not make you LAUGH - U are not ALIVE ON THE INSIDE!!! Cuz anyone who's breathing will find laughs in his comedy style and content... and PIMP-INSPIRED Style and Attitude!! Very much a man made to make others laugh and he blazes the show from BEGINNING TO END - NO FILLER JOKES!!! even the simplest things said by him, are 10 times as funny as they would be coming from someone else.... So - if U wanna gather around, w/some friends, have some drinks, chill and have a REAL GOOD time - A Night AIN'T a Nite without a Katt Williams Invite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1162512000,17,875,4.579617834394904

OMG KATT willis is hilarious, I have watched it so many times after. I even have it on my cell phone and watch it on the way to work.

The whole routine is funny

When he starts dancing, I AM IN TEARS

and being a MJ fan i coupldnt help but laugh at KATT

I only wished my brother was here to watch it with me.  NOT SUITABLE for any children I know or most right wingers, but really funny otherwise.

I have seen most of Katt Williams specials, old underground-ish clips, and just a ton of his work...I love stand up comedy and have a true passion for their ability.

2616325,2,B000GRUN40,Katt Williams is very entertaining with his stories and illustrations. His tapes are hard to watch because its almost like a verbal warfare.

Katt is not trying to talk bad about anyone, just make fun of ourselves has humans.  My husband and I love this video and it has shaped our own little comedic talk that we do with each other.

I just happened to catch him on comedy central one night - loved him ever sense.  You gotta take the language with him - comes with the territory - but he is really funny.  I think he is smart too - pay attention between the lines - he is really more in tune than he lets on with being the silly guy he is.  Just my opinion.  His lifestyle may be wild - I don't know... that is his business.",1254787200,2,549,3.857142857142857

2616363,5,B000GRUN40,"If you're a fan of stand-up comedy or just want a good laugh, Katt Williams- The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1 is what to get. He will keep you laughing all night long.

I first saw Katt Williams in Friday After Next and he was so funny as hell to me. He soon would get a spot on MTV's WildN'Out with Nick Cannon as Money Mike. This stand-up comedy act concert is a 100x's better than anything he did on WildN'Out. I laughed non-stopped through out this whole dvd. This is some funny shiznit.

The event is held in Atlanta, GA at the Atlanta Civic Center and it is hosted by Anthony Anderson. Anderson soon introduces Katt to the stage and then the laughter begins. Special appearences include Snoop Dogg & Lil Jon.

Katt touches on many subjects such as the affects of weed, drugs, haters, gayness, the war in Iraq, children, drinking, white, black, & spanish people but my favorite part is defiantely when Katt gets on Michael Jackson. I cracked up so hard when Katt started janking on Michael. Even to this day, I still bust out laughing. This is just a great stand-up comedy act. The overall story to the whole act is don't take life for granted and don't let the little things interfere with your life.

I also advise you don't buy this for the younger children, this concert has a lot of strong language. This won't be good buy for the little children. Overall this has some great laughter. I highly recommend on this comedy act. This will keep you laughing from beginning to end.",1222387200,,1478,4.462962962962963

2616367,5,B000GRUN40,"Katt played Michael's high school arch nemesis ""Bobby Shaw"" during season 4 and 5 of ""My Wife and Kids"". He had me then - I laughed with tears. In fact Damon could hardly keep his composure.

Next I caught him on MTV's - ""Nick Cannon Presents: Wild n Out"". Improv - two squads battle - each had a captain. One was always Nick and the other a celebrity guest. Last night I saw Katt & Kayne battle in the ""Haters Game"" - very funny.

THE PIMP CHRONICLES PART 1 had me on the floor rolling in laughter. He had me hooked. It's a MUST SEE!

He's the best comedian since Richard Pryor. I really like Chris Rock but he doesn't have anything on Katt. Katt's a natural.

Then I bought a CD made by DJ Drama and Katt Williams ""Gangsta Grillz"".

So, I was disappointed because I thought I was going to hear new jokes and/or different material he was introducing. What's so sad, I just paid $ to see him live in concert on Long Island and he told 75% of the jokes on this DVD. Now that's a huge waste of my money. Katt is hilarious... he needs to write some ""NEW"" material and stop promoting this OLD stuff we all heard to many times over.

I am still laughing at the mere thought of his many facial expressions seen while cutting up. Without giving any details, I highly recommend this as the absolute best of the DVD's of the 3 out as of this posting. Gather some friends up if you want a comedy party, but DO NOT serve food nor drink(s). They will be wearing them more than eating/drinking them - seriously. Just an awesome comedian who I hope (with newer material and getting back to the hunger of the art) will stay visible for a long, long time. We need more PIMPIN'!!",1196208000,,674,4.487804878048781

Don't get it twisted but, knowing what I do know he (and Mike Epps who like a lot) just need more experience as far as stand-up routines go. Both of these cat's have to talent to push the boundaries of black comedy even further. I'd love to see that. Unfortunately, too many newer comics have simply recycled old cliche's and updated older jokes from the 80's and 90's. Peace.",1186444800,,510,4.494623655913978

I knew it would just be a matter of time before he would blow-up and make his comedic mark on the world.  He's done it with the Pimp Chronicles.  His comedy is hilarious but it's truthful.  He does what many African American comedians today do - He takes our everyday lives and he puts a spin on them like no one else.  He also teaches and that's where he earns my respect.  There are a lot of messages for people in this DVD along with side-splitting laughter.  When he talked about Michael Jackson I couldn't stop laughing.  Katt Williams has a long healthy career ahead.  No doubt about it!",1183248000,5,756,4.420289855072464
2616418,4,B000GRUN40,"I must confess that I knew very little of Katt Williams when I bought this disc, so I was able to approach it with an open mind.

From the word go, Katt starts ripping you up with some very sharp wit. There is a dryness to the jokes at times which is juxtaposed to the furious pace at which they are unflinchingly delivered. He is a master craftsman at the top of his game on this disc. Katt is unrelenting in his quest to make you vomit from laughter - and you will too if you are not careful. He is obviously well read and that is always a huge advantage for any comedian. His observational skills are on the money and his topics relevant. There isn't a dull moment with this guy on stage. The jokes are crisp and original; his style and presentation unique; his physical humour spellbinding - with great usage of facial expression and tonality. His pace varies from fast to hectic. There is nothing pimp-like (or distasteful) about this performance all the way through. I rate Katt very highly.

I am eagerly awaiting the sequel. Hope it's just as brilliant
Do yourself a favour and go buy this dvd. Just don't watch it with any sensitive, sanctimonious, characters. It is also unsuitable for kids.",1181520000,5,1201,4.47945205479452
