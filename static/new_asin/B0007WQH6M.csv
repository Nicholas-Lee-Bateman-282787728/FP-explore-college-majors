I was totally drawn in to both characters.  Barry Bostwick is dreamy in this drama!",1138752000,,255,3.8653846153846154

2246966,5,B0007WQH6M,"I like this movie very much. It was made in 1994. It has one of my two favorite actors which are Lindsay Wagner and Barry Bostwick. I like their roles very much, they both done a movie together which is Judith Krantz's Scruples which was made in 1980. The sad part was when Daphne was hit by a car after coming from the Christmas party and her husband Jeff and her daughter Aimee died in the fire while she is pregnant with their deaf son Andrew raising it alone and also met and fell in love with Justin Wakefield the movie star which was not the perfect man for her. During the film Matthew Dane and Daphne Fields were the perfect match for each other and also a father figure for Andrew, At the final of the film Daphne and Matthew were in love with each other all along which I knew during the film and they both became engaged to get marry. Also I'm glad she has survived from her accident from being in a coma and also having an concussion during her accident",1366329600,2,965,4.221621621621622

2246969,4,B0007WQH6M,"I saw the television version of once in a lifetime, and the jeffery character was played by Rex Smith who is also a singer also. would have liked uncut version of movie because viewer usually misses something. storyline somewhat confusing if you come in the middle of story, glad the lead female chose the right man. young actor who played her son, excellent. hope that Mr. Smith does more film work with Ms. Wagner. his part in this film too short. his talent is unrated like Mr. Bostwicks. good to watch on quiet afternoon or snowy day!!",1326240000,2,539,4.56701030927835

8052941,5,B0007WQH6M,"Two of my favorites, Lindsay Wagner and Barry Bostwick give very believable performances as friends that eventually realize their love for each other.  Very entertaining -typical Danielle Steel story, involving the tragic deaths of a women's husband and child, and her eventual search for a new  life and love. Lindsay Wagner's portrayal was so very real, she's a talented actress and excels in roles like this. I really enjoyed it!",1455321600,,432,5.1571428571428575
