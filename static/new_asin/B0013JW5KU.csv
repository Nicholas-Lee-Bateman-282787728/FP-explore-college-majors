8251475,5,B0013JW5KU,All the family really enjoy watching this DVD. We became Monster Jam Fans for my 4 years-old boy and he thanks us everytime we watch the DVD.,1247529600,,141,4.2592592592592595
8251476,4,B0013JW5KU,"We recently went to the local Monster Jam and had so much fun, we decided to order the video for my son's birthday present.  He has really enjoyed watching it over and over.  The combination of the action and the interviews make it enjoyable for adults...but the kids would rather not have the interviews to slow up the action.",1234915200,2,327,4.52542372881356
8251477,5,B0013JW5KU,"My husband introduced my older son to monster trucks a few years ago, and since then we've had another son and lots more trucks enter the house. Then he took them to the shows and watch out! They're now junkies! Got this dvd for them, and my 2 y/o wants it on constantly. No matter how many times they've seen it, all 3 of them still shout ""whoa did you see that"" through-out every jump, crash, flip.  Lots of excitement in these 2 disks. Behind the scenes extras. No interactives (I don't think so). Good interviews with the drivers so the kids can hear their perspectives. Lots of shouting & noise Moms! But good, clean boy fun!",1229385600,,630,4.384615384615385
8251478,4,B0013JW5KU,"I bought this specifically for the Grave Digger Encore of 5 Grave Diggers freestyling at the same time.  Instead they showed only a minute of a four minute encore, very disappointed!  Otherwise it was a great DVD with all the rest of the action.",1216857600,,245,4.545454545454546
8251479,5,B0013JW5KU,"Not originally being a Monster Truck fan but the mother of a 4-year-old one, I began watching our new DVD with some skepticism.  Will this DVD change me into a howling, foam-finger wielding Grave Digger fan or just a tolerant mother who replayed the DVD many times over for the love of my son?  Well, while I might not be painting my body blue to support the Blue Thunder behemoth, I certainly guiltlessly enjoyed watching the heavy-duty engine roaring and junk car jumping competition at the edge of my seat and cheering loudly for my favorite underdog Monster Truck.  Oh, and my son loved it, too!",1216166400,,599,4.632075471698113
8251480,5,B0013JW5KU,My 3 year old loves monster trucks and when we first bought this dvd he sat there and watched the entire show. Now my 15 month old actually sits with his brother and watches the dvd. Love it!!,1210809600,,192,4.078947368421052
