8383691,3,B002XHX5GO,"I haven't seen the previous release Artie did on DVD that many reviewers have said they heard all of this before and better. So I can actually give it 3 stars, because of hearing it for the first time. What causes me to not give it any higher then 2 & a half to 3 stars is the cheap applause method that I am sick of comedians using to extend their shows. Keep in mind, this is supposed to be a comedy DVD, so a 5 min round of applause for saying, ""Bless the American troops in Iraq"" and then spending the final 10 minutes of the show bringing up people who Artie said saved his life and should be given a round of applause for it, is in my book, just time wasting. I'm not being insensitive to Artie's life, I am glad he has kicked his heroin addiction, but this is supposed to be a stand-up comedy performance, not ""This is your life.""",1284336000,,837,4.078787878787879
