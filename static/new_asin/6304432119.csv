Jack Taylor, a cocky investigative reporter, is also in the same boat because he must take care of his daughter for the entire  week.  Taylor, being the irresponsible one, forgets to call Parker to  inform her that she wouldn't need to pick up his daughter to school.  As a  result, their children missed their field trip.  Parker, being upset at  this point, refuses to associate with Taylor.  However, fate comes into  play and they are forced to depend on each other, which will cause them to  develop feelings for each other.  This movie is realistic in that it  doesn't go into emotional overload.  In addition to this, the characters  play out their mistakes like regular human beings. This is a great movie to  watch during a rainy day.",917481600,2,834,4.6875

It's not perfect, but it's a decent series to watch. Beautiful scenery, great actors (except maybe 1...), lovely music, a decent plot though a little far-fetched (aren't all dramas?). I think it's worth at least 3.5 or 4 stars. This is a serene & sad melodrama, not a romance comedy so why compare it to one. Yesasia does a great job on their subtitles and video quality here as always.",1339459200,,521,4.381443298969073
870477,1,6304432119,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm relatively new to the kdrama/kpop scene.  I've only seen a couple of shows. So after watching & falling in love with Coffee Prince, I came to a conclusion. (I didn't realize it until now but) I've been spoiled by watching it.  Were all kdramas this good?  If this is the bar they set over there, then 1 thing was very clear: I needed to get my wetsuit on because the Hallyu Wave was coming on strong & taking me over! To which I say: Bring It Baby! :)

Armed with that optimistic openness, I bought One Fine Day thinking that I'd love it just as much.  I WANTED to love it; I really did.  And when I bought the DVD boxset, I disregarded the MANY (putting this kindly) lukewarm reviews I've seen for One Fine Day. So I sat down with my popcorn & my tissues (just because it IS a kdrama) and gave it shot.

But like I mentioned previously, I've been spoiled.  I can't go back to lesser series.  Unfortunately, One Fine Day falls under this category.

I'll admit that some of the reviews (here and on other sites I've read) have some valid points.  But I wouldn't say that any one particular actor/actress' performance was THAT bad.  Or that the story dragged in certain places, or that the dialogue was cheesy or that I couldn't find the empathy/connection to the characters' dilemmas.  I can't put my finger on it.  It was everything all together.  Or maybe it was just one thing in particular.

There is a lot to be said about on-screen chemistry. It can save a ... lower-than-average drama.  It glosses over the lacking aspects of a series and makes viewers tune in willingly/happily/faithfully. This is because sometimes it can communicate to the audience better than anything in a script or director's editing choices. Do you know what the on-screen chemistry is saying in One Fine Day?

""Knock, knock. Who's there? Not me.""

And after the hearing that for 5 episodes, neither was I. I couldn't take it anymore.  I haven't gone back to finish the series since.  That was almost 3-4 months ago.  And that's a shame because I really wanted to like it.",1332547200,,2091,4.4907161803713525
870479,2,6304432119,"I gave up on this short series after 6 episodes -- skipping to the last to see how it ends. Here's why:

It started out promisingly, in sunny Sydney Australia where we meet the protagonist (played by Gong Yoo), a small time hoodlum, with this adopted family that includes a step-sister who's determined to marry him -- but she has a heart problem cuz many many Korean dramas have to have someone terminally or severely ill (which otherwise doesn't seem to affect their lifestyle). However, he and the family return to Seoul when his long-lost real sister is spotted -- and there the story loses momentum.

One problem is too obvious: Sung Yu Ri as the long-lost sister. She's pretty -- but extremely bland. She's a undead actress who walks and talks -- she's convincing only to those who are taken by her looks. Same goes for the second male lead, Nam Gong Min. In scenes together, they sometimes achieve a negative presence.

Yu Ri's inadequency can be seen when she appears with the cute and vivacious Lee Yeon Hee who plays the step-sister with the heart problem.

Amiable Gong Yoo does well as the brother -- but the role isn't as demanding as the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/COFFEE-PRINCE/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">COFFEE PRINCE</a>&nbsp;-- which is my way of saying the scriptwriting doesn't compare, either.

At least there's nice photography and location shooting.

If you're obsessed with any of the actors, you'll probably get more enjoyment out of this than I did.

BOY, did I get surprised.  I watched the first show of the second season. At this point, I wanted to know more about these characters and started watching the shows from the first season. To say the least, I was hooked and looking forward to each new show.  This is a well written, honest look at college life.  It will make you laugh, smile and sometimes even a little sad.

870562,5,6304432119,I love this movie. Michelle Pfeiffer & George Clooney blow away any Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan boring films away. This is deffinily my favorite movie Michelle Pfeiffer & George Clooney are just the perfect couple characters in this movie. I also absolutily love Sammy Parker (Alex D. Linz) he is just so cute. I thought Home Alone 3 was his first and best well I was deffinitly wrong their. He can deffinilty act and near the end when Melanie Parker (Michelle Pfeiffer) is at the restrunt with her boss and his boss Alex just gives you this smile that makes you want you want to pinch his cheek.

870626,5,6304432119,"My husband and I both watched ""One Fine Day"" and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of acting and plot.  This movie had more depth than most people probably notice.  There was the superficial romance, and comedy.  Then the underlying story of the career chase at the expense of family.
I wasn't sure just how it would be resolved and was happy to see that in the end family won out.  This is a must see in this day and age when parents of both sexes tend to put everything else before their home commitments.  The consequences of power grabs was shown in a very realistic way.  I know.  I've seen it close up with people I know and maybe this movie would be a good gift, subtle hint, to someone you know who could use a little push to make wiser decisions of their own.  Who knows, it might just be the impetus needed to save a family from the problems that happen when career trumps home life.
One of the best movies that I've seen George Clooney in, next to Perfect Storm.  He can actually act.  Michelle Pfeiffer brought more talent to this film than I've usually seen from her also.  The best plots seem to bring out the best in actors.  What a great vehicle for actors, and the improvement of family life in this day and age.  It deserved a PG rating and will be part of my home collection.",1068422400,8,1301,4.282786885245901

We've enjoyed many movies of this style and like both of the stars but we were only able to gut it out for 30 minutes and then bailed. I can count on one hand the number of times that we've done that in the last 40 years. I think it deserved 2.5 stars but since we only watched 30 minutes I rounded up. Why didn't it work? All the humor seemed predictable, overly contrived and annouying.

870632,5,6304432119,"This is old-fashioned cinema at its best:  Charming leading man and beautiful leading lady meet in plausible yet impossible circumstances, only to fall deeply in love, despite efforts to the contrary on both parts.  The casting is superb, the cinematography just right, and the writing excellent. This is romantic comedy at its finest.
If, however, you have a child under age 6, have a full-time job, and/or are single, this movie takes on a whole new level.  I loved this movie for a long time before I became a working mom, now I identify with this movie.  What was so artistically superior is now so amazingly realistic.  Perhaps that is its brilliance: it works on many levels.
There is one scene in which the children need on-the-spot costumes for superhero day at day care and Pfeiffer's character reaches in her tote and proceeds to dress two preschoolers in ad hoc superhero duds.  Upon seeing this, Clooney's character remarks that he needs a bag like that.  It is a hilarious scene, but to a mom, an oh-so-real one.

The story is simple and uncomplicated that makes the movie great, because it could possibly happen to anyone. Michelle and George are perfetly cast, both oozing megawatt charisma. It's impossible to hate the two. I think their pairing is one of the best. Michelle has never been so likable and i think is a must see to all her fans. Part of the greatness of this film is the charming prescence of the 2 kids, they are awesome. Bottom line: I guarantee you that you'll enjoy this movie, whether watch it alone or with someone.

There are certain parts that seem silly and forced (like the Clooney subplot mentioned in the amazon.com review), but Clooney and Pfeiffer pull off their characters with enough charm and realism that any problems you may have with the logic of the story can be forgiven.

I love this movie.  The kids are cute, George is funny, New York is hectic, and Michelle Pfeiffer is adorably anal.  When George takes the kids for the week, he forgets to telephone Michelle (forgive me, I never remember characters names) and let her know that they wouldn't be needing her that particular morning.  This sets off a chain of events leading to their having to trade baby-sitting duties for eachother.  This wouldn't be too big a problem except each is going through a career crises at the same time.

870761,1,6304432119,"Yeah the other amateur reviewers loved this movie but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The love story is ridiculous- I would like to see an ending scene like Animal House  in which the movie says what happens next. In this case it would say the two dated for a few months and then broke up after realizing the other was exactly like their ex-spouse.  Good parenting is portrayed as giving a child exactly what the child wants. Another example of the portrayal of ""good parenting"": A six year old girl wanders out of a store and down the streets of New York following a cat. When she is found Dad's not mad, he gets her a kitten. I have a six year old, he is not mature for his age and I am not very strict but I cannot imagine that he would do this. If he did my reaction would not be to get him a kitten.  Another example of exemplary parenting:  After his daughter has gone to bed on a school night Dad gets her up and goes off to see Mom on a pretext of returning some fish from the school. Why he does this is unknown as he has the fishbowl and could simply bring it to school the next morning. Anyway, Mom gets the son up and the kids are plopped on the bed to watch a two hour movie (The Wizard of Oz) so our romantic leads can be alone.  The story involving George Clooney's job is so unbelievable that the movie is almost worth watching for laughs.

870762,5,6304432119,"I love this movie.  When it first came out, I thought it was great - but I was only 15 - I didn't understand it really, so it wasn't as great as I think it is now.  Actually, I totally forgot it existed until a few months ago when I went to Blockbuster and there was nothing there to rent - I saw ""One Fine Day"" and took it home - I watched it and was surprised that I'd forgotten more than half the plot, which was good - it was like watching a movie I had never seen before.  It was great understanding the movie - the subtle flirtation between Clooney and Pfeiffer, the role of the kids in their relationship, and looks on Clooney's face when he sees Pfeiffer walk into the 9th Street Drop-In Center.  The movie is timeless - the plot is a little cheesy, but I love it - I've watched it so many more times cause I think it's just great. By the way... as a 15-year-old, you don't realize how subtly hot Clooney is until the second time around.",983232000,,945,4.064516129032258
870864,3,6304432119,"Yeah, Momma said there'd be days like this. What she didn't say was that anyone would ever want to film one of them. This movie is a drag. Painstakingly slow and ""sweet"", it almost puts you to sleep while taking a long and pristinely pure route to the budding romance between Pfeiffer and Clooney. This is the type of movie best suited to actresses like Meg Ryan, not to serious and generally talented people such as Pfeiffer.
All that said, why then did I give it 3 stars, let alone 1? Well, I'd give it 2 1/2 actually...but Amazon does not have that option. So I gave it the benefit of the doubt - it was, after all, two bucks.
The reasons behind the stars: The occasional humor was, if stupid in places, hilarious. I am a melter for any cats in a movie, and there were some very sweet ones here. Lest you think me strange - if I love cats why not the movie? - the other reason to give this anything was - of course, the same reason I rented it in the first place - George Clooney. Reprising his role in ER, he shows us  the picture of a bohemian writer who is not exactly businesslike in either work or child care. Why this is supposed to be negative, I don't know - many of us children of the flower children grew up similarily and I don't see the problem. Hey, we'll put the guns down. :>
Yeah, Clooney has bedroom eyes and a good voice, the cats are darling, the humor is pretty good, but unless those reasons appeal to you, don't bother. There are many better movies out there - if you're looking for a sweet screwball romance, try Benny & Joon. That was a work of art, not of spun sugar.

870867,5,6304432119,"This movie was plain cute.  It's rare to see a light-hearted movie where the whole family can enjoy where instead of two teenagers finding romance, it's two parents.  Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney were great  together.  It seemed like they had a lot of fun being in the movie  together.",961200000,2,293,4.78
870868,4,6304432119,"I think I must have been one of the 2 or 3 people in the country who hadn't seen ER when I first caught this movie on one of the premium movie channels.  I wasn't a major George Clooney fan--it's not that I didn't like  him, I just didn't know much about him.
All of that changed after seeing  this movie.  I hadn't even been looking for it.  I was just channel surfing  one Saturday afternoon and caught it by accident.  However, the other 99  times I've watched the movie have been quite on purpose, thank  you!
Granted, it's not the most intricate of plots, but it is very well  acted by 4 gifted professionals.  Clooney and Pfeiffer as the single  parents are quite believable and endearing, and the 2 kids are very  skilled, even at their young ages.  The movie has some of that Cary  Grant/Jimmy Stewart sort of charm and the approach/avoidance of the  developing love affair between the two parents is engaging.  By the time  George Clooney finally plants a kiss on Michelle Pfeiffer's lips, my toes  were curling!
If you want a movie that will leave you with a little smile  on your face, you can't go wrong with this one.",953856000,4,1130,4.419512195121952

Halfway through the movie it skipped and stopped and I had to skip the chapter to move forward. I don't have trouble with any of my other movies and I've checked to make sure it's not my DVD/Blu-ray player. Disappointed with this product, but I love this movie. George Cloony and Michelle Pfiefer make a great team.",1498262400,,401,4.506849315068493
