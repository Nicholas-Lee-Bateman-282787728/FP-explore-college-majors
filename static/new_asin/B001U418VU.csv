8342809,3,B001U418VU,"Despite the fact that Por Un Polvo can be found in movie rental kiosks, it's unusually absent from the Internet Movie Database. The film, set and shot in Venezuela, is your typical low-budget effort with a handful of recognized South American actors.

You don't have to be a movie buff to realize that the lighting job done for any shoot not involving direct daylight was horribly inadequate. There's nothing particularly special about the film's direction or cinematography, either. The soundtrack is surprisingly decent, though, with some funk-blended salsa that keeps the film moving along.

One of the movie's selling points was apparently the eye candy courtesy of bombshell model Jessika Grau, and the director has no reservations about getting every inch of her on film (not that I'm complaining).

Overall, the story was bizarre, the special effects were laughable, and the overacting was just over the top. But despite all of that, it was an unusually interesting movie. I've watched countless movies (major and straight-to-DVD alike) that were extremely predictable. For all of its faults, this movie will keep you guessing until the end, and even the conclusion offers a nice surprise. You will either love this movie or hate it, or if you're like me, maybe a little bit of both. Watch it yourself and find out.",1262736000,,1322,5.055045871559633

This film is ONE (among others) of the big success movies that Carlos Malav have ever made... The acting of Jessika Grau is perfect... ione of the most valuable things i respect about actors is the ability of change the way they look, talk, move... Jessika is a pro model, TV actress, is the face of a lot of products and is a GREAT movie star... Jean Paul Leroux had it's own success here too... the most remarkable acting i have is the acting of William Goit... this professional actor has an amazing acting gift... i personally know this actor and when you see this movie, you can tell HOW great he is... in this movie he looks greasy, bad italian-spanish talkings, a disgusting greasy long hair and bad manners... well... in venezuela, he's one of the biggest actors in the country... besides, he's a cult person, great manners, and have a nice clean look.... i totally recomend this movie... you won't waste your money nor your time!!!",1257984000,2,1157,4.5673076923076925
8342811,1,B001U418VU,"Spare yourself! I can't believe I even wasted the time, contemplating whether or not to rent this at Redbox. Wish I had just thrown $1 on the ground and forgotten about it. It makes me mad that that something like this even finds the celluloid! Maybe my clue should have been that I could not find it, even after checking many similar titles, on IMDB. Folks, I do recommend IMDB when in doubt. DO NOT EVEN think of buying this, let alone your time watching a rental. Amazon needs to drop it!",1257811200,,491,4.3478260869565215
