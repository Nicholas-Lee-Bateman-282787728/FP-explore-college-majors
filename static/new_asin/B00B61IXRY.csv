8563115,4,B00B61IXRY,"I got hooked on this Japanese drama (w/ English subtitles) after watching the first episode on YouTube (I think the whole 10-episodes are there too, if you don't want to pay Amazon's ~$50 price for the series.  But even so, if you want to give as a gift (like I did, to a relative of ours who is an 'Air Traffic Controller'), I found too-late this identical 3-dvd set on Ebay by multiple sellers for just $19.00 to ~$22.00!!  Am now kicking myself for not checking there first ...lacking research, I spent twice what I had to.",1481673600,,526,4.412371134020619
8563116,5,B00B61IXRY,"Editorial review of content is correct, a little bit more information can be found in wiki.d-addicts (Tokyo Airport), therefore I won't go into plot details.
It's a set of three DVDs, you can watch right away (meaning: no annoying ads before the main feature).
Picture and sound quality (spoken language: Japanese) are superb. To be honest I had been worrying about quality of English subtitles (you never know what you will get) but they are actually very good, not flawless however regarding spelling of words, but timing and translation are always perfect.
For fans of Fukada Kyoko this is a real treat because she is present in almost every scene.
