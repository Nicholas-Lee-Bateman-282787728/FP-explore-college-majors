8054674,5,B0007Z0RCE,I have a collection of 75 of John Wayne's movies.  This is one of his best & perhaps because it was directed by John Ford.  It is hard to find this movie.  It is the story of 3 bank robbers who while being harried by the law find a woman having a baby.  As she is dying in childbirth she makes these scoundrels promise to be the baby's godfathers.  John Wayne's character ends up as the only survivor as the godfathers try to get the baby safely across the desert.,1118448000,2,464,4.111111111111111
8054675,4,B0007Z0RCE,"Looks like the ""Three Kings,"" which was advertised as the best original screenplay of 1999, resembles the ""Three Godfathers.""

Wayne (Clooney) and his outlaw friends (Kings' soliders) get greedy, steal gold, and flee into the desert. Along the way they become the ""godfathers"" of a dying woman's baby (abandoned Iraqi rebels). They then get a conscience and realize they need to throw away their plans in order to save the baby (back to ""Kings"" abandoned Iraqi rebels). So some of the outlaws (soldiers) unfortunately die along they way.

""Three Kings"" is a nice movie but give credit where credit is due. You just can't beat the Duke and John Ford! Ford and the Duke did give credit to the past film versions. They even dedicated ""Godfathers"" to the original star of the silent film version.

Get the ""Three Godfathers."" You'll love it!",1117843200,,837,4.880281690140845
