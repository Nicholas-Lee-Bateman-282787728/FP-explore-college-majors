8082782,5,B000B7AOUS,"This performance is simply extraordinary. It's very rare to see a performance where the artist is, well, uhm, perfect, like this.  He sings every note on key, plays every note perfectly, strongly connects with the audience, and yet he is often jumping around on stage and giving an improvisational impression.  Every member of his band is rock-solid.  The audio and video quality are great.  He is accomplished at keyboards, but his true mastery shows on both acoustic and electric guitar. Things to watch for:
-A young lady in the audience at one point in tears at his mastery.
-The forward pickups on his fender guitar completely missing (thus, all scorching tone provided by the bridge pickup).
-Dobro and Mandolin adding some acoustic authenticity.
-Allowing other members of the band to take vocal solos (generous).
-As he's playing, laying down near the audience and grabbing a gal's camera and taking a photo of both of them, and later signing an autograph as he's singing/playing.  Unbelievable.

In terms of musicianship, the only other country music DVD in this class (in my opinion) is the one by the Dixie Chicks.

Since he's an Aussie, I'm very impressed that he understands ""American"" country music so well.  Well done, Keith!",1193270400,4,1240,5.014634146341463
