2109687,4,B0002O7XTU,"First off - the crass language.  [Were they trying to make this movie trashy?] Certainly not intensely masculine!

Beckett is back - [not with the honed body we would have like to see] but still a strong masculine charisma.

Yup! being done dirt to by his superiors? They want him dead too!  That would eliminate all their loose ends.

I was waiting to hear that he had gone back and eliminated them.

I did get what I was waiting for though.  A shot that seems impossible to make.  Doing what seems impossible is what we look for in our Super Heroes and especially our Snipers.

Come on you guys.  What is with you that you cheapen our good movies [almost good] with barnyard language.

I really get disgusted with woman [and men for that matter] with vulgar mouths.  I blame this on the writers and directors who seem to have illiterate minds.

Vulgarity is not a sign of masculine charisma - just low-bred mongrels.

I enjoyed Beckett - I ignored the crass language - and I love the shot! For Mature audiences only.",1127692800,7,1018,4.491803278688525
2109688,2,B0002O7XTU,"For those who still remember the terrific acting of Tom Berenger in Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' it is painful to watch him in 'Sniper 3' (which is also set in Vietnam).  Not that the film is a complete failure.  Actually, Tom Berenger's performace as the veteran sniper Thomas Beckett is fairly good, if not his best.  But the film's lazy direction (from the director of 'From the Dusk till Dawn: 3' ... no wonder) is too conspicous, killing the potential that some of the actions and characters might have.

Not much can be called original about the script of 'Sniper 3.'  Thomas Beckett is sent to Vietnam, where he fought his war with his buddy during the war 30 years ago.  But Beckett is informed that the friend who is supposed to be dead is now ruling the underground community as druglord (the idea inspired by 'Apocalypse Now').  And Beckett's assignment is to kill him.

Byron Mann appears as Sgt. Beckett's partner from Vietnam, and Thailand provides the convincing locations for the backdrop.  Both actors did good acting, and the film tries to show the deeper characterization about Beckett, who talks about his old days, and even attends a wedding party (not drunk for that matter).  The results of the efforts are not bad.

But the actions are so-so at best, with shoddy editing that often makes me wonder what is going on.  For example, after Beckett's first 'hit,' a shoot-out scene at the rooftop begins, but as the film fails to show who is shooting (at) who, the sequence only shows alternately the confusing images of men shooting guns and men who got shot.  And I still do not fully understand what happened in the last chapter, the terribly hurried and awfully incoherent wrap-up that comes with bamboo impalement.  Excuse me, but I thought this is about a sniper's story...right?

Though the film is watchable thanks to the actors and locale, 'Sniper 3' reminds us of the fact that we really need somebody who can save Tom Berenger from this Grade B straight-to-video hell.",1125619200,2,1995,4.758720930232558
2109689,2,B0002O7XTU,This is a long way off from Sniper I & Sniper II.  It is geared towards MOUT environments and nothing is very tactical in this movie.  Keep the Sniper films in the bush and out of urban environments.,1110844800,2,199,4.2105263157894735
2109690,1,B0002O7XTU,"My apologies to fans of this series. I enjoyed the first two of this admittedly low-budget series, but this one should have been left on the cutting-room floor. Who would believe that an aging, overweight alcoholic sniper would be first choice on a sensitive mission? And who would believe that an ACTIVE Marine sniper would be so out of shape at ANY age? I'm not knocking Tom Berenger for putting on a few, but come on -- make the story believable. Instead, we get the cliche of a tormented hero potentially drinking his life and career away. How many times has this been done?

My second biggest gripe was with the editing. Beckett was supposed to have lost his index (trigger) finger on his right hand; it was even a subject for this movie. So I'm sitting here watching his ""missing"" finger in almost every scene -- curled up, of course, but clearly visible. Couldn't they have at least tried to make this believable? This part would've been great on Saturday Night Live.

And what's up with the f-word in every scene with confrontation? Even the SUBTITLES were loaded with expletives. I'm no prude, but even a low-budget movie like this could've had a little class.

Overall, this was so weak as a movie I couldn't get into any of the characters, and I was really looking forward to it. It would have been a more convincing story line to have Beckett as an older mentor of a promising sniper, with a cheap prosthesis on his hand so we wouldn't have to pretend not to see the finger he lost years earlier, and weave his tormented past into his goals of retiring honorably, and even being involved in one last mission. But the way this was done was just plain disappointing.",1102636800,8,1676,4.561461794019934
2109691,4,B0002O7XTU,"This third story about Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett fits in well with the other two because it draws atmosphere and story detail from both without becoming a clone.  I liked the personal history bits about Beckett - we know very little about him as an individual but now we at least learn a few very interesting facets of his life. In the short scene in which he looked at his box of ""memories"", I recalled a scene in Sniper (1) where he was asked why he carried several sets of dogtags around and his reply - ""respect"". If you are a Berenger fan, and especially if you have seen Sniper 1 and 2, you will like this DVD.  His Asian co-star was very good, especially in all the  scenes shot about the slimey underbelly of Ho Chi Minh City. The action was less in this movie, but the story, direction and locales were well done and chosen.  I was a bit sorry to see Tom has put on a few unneeded pounds, but, as the progression of the series warrants, he cannot look and act as he did in the early years - that would be a mistake!  I hope you at least rent this DVD and do not miss out on a worthy episode about the life of Tom Beckett, the now reluctant Sniper.  If you give the story a bit of thought, you'll see the psychological points shown about how Beckett is forever drawn into the former occupation which brought him acclaim and from which he cannot now withdraw.",1099526400,8,1379,4.244274809160306
2109692,3,B0002O7XTU,"This time around Thomas Beckett is sent out by NSA to track down and kill a druglord in Vietnam who happens to be his good friend whom he fought alongside in the war.  Beckett is in for surprises as he finds out more details about his mission and about the reasons why he is sent there.  He also partners with a local cop in Ho Chi Minh City, who is trained in martial arts.

Like Sniper 2, this movie looks low budget and features unknown actors, whose acting are just adequate (except the Vietnamese cop, who did a good job). Tom Berenger, however, is always good and makes up for the bad acting done by some of the others.

There are some things in this movie that are different:

a) It reveals more about Beckett's personal life than the other two films (e.g. his past, his friendships, his emotional side, etc.)

b) Some of the action is influenced by the Hong Kong action style, with the shoot-outs done in slow motion, and Beckett's partner getting to use his martial arts expertise to eliminate some of the bad guys.

c) Tom Berenger has gained a few more pounds since Sniper 2 and he seems to lumber rather than run. (He needs to shed some weight in order to be believable as a Marine Sniper.)  However, to the script's credit, Beckett gets in trouble with his superior for his drinking and his lack of physical fitness.

I gave this movie 3 stars because it could have been a lot better, given a bigger budget, better story, well-known actors and accomplished directors that we recognize.  Even so, there are worse ways to spend an evening.

Unfortunately, the DVD itself does not contain any special features.",1096761600,15,1620,4.513698630136986

2109712,3,B0002O7XTU,"I enjoyed the first two sniper films, and this one had a lot of action, but this one seemed to be a class B film. Beranger looked very overweight, drinking too much, much stress was placed on him having a shaking finger at the start of the film, but was dropped as important to the plot at the end. I also had the feeling that Beranger did a walk through the film without any energy.

2109776,1,B0002O7XTU,"Unfortunately, unlike the original film ""Sniper"", along with ""Sniper 2"", and ""Sniper Reloaded"" (which were at least somewhat believable or plausible in ""the real world""), this one really should never have been made. Tom Berenger's character (Thomas Beckett) was far too out of shape, and most of all, the overall movie plot ranged from silly to outright stupid - especially at the end when these ""Vietnamese child killers"" bowed down to Beckett as their ""new God"" after Beckett killed his best friend who had gone rogue. OH PULLLEEEEEEESE........!! This movie was stupid to the core. Like the others, it started out innocently enough - but very quickly ""morphed"" into something of a ""You've gotta be s _ _ _ ting me"" type of film! TOTALLY unbelievable, and a total waste of film and production costs, in my opinion. I can't believe Berenger actually stooped so low to make this movie - much like Louis Gossett, Jr. stooping to make ""Iron Eagle"" and its ridiculous & subsequent sequels.

I was just going to check it out, thinking it would be a trashy re-hash of a formerly great original movie and I would probably shut it off after the first twenty minutes, but I was really surprised.

Berenger, always a great looking guy in my book, definitely WAS heavier, and somewhat 'lumbering'  but oddly, looked pretty good in the face for his age...and didn't look 'facelifted.""

I would love to see this guy with another 20 pounds off--he would, I swear, look VERY close to how he used to, 25 years ago.  Regardless, there  has always been something about him, even now,  in that he can always hold your interest on the screen, with a kind of no-nonsense, sexy tough guy with a heart, the character that he always plays.

And the fact that he was the first choice for this mission to Asia still made sense, because, due to his former relationship with the target from 30 years before during the Vietnam war, he was the one who could get closest to him.  So that part was not really a problem for me.

The young asian cop was EXCELLENT...sorry I don't have his name here.  He was taut, believeable, charismatic, had the looks, charm and the hard edge..and he really was a good foil for the older Berenger.

And the twists and turns of the plot kept me interested thru the whole movie.  The ending was wild and no, I didn't see that one coming !",1355270400,,1492,4.358695652173913
