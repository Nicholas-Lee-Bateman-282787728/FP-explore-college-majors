8253791,5,B00140PKBY,"Great footage. Looks like a piece of Soviet Propaganda. ""Masses of fighters that can outrun all usaf (not U.S.A.F) fighters"". ""More anti-aircraft missiles than all other countries combined"". Still, if taken as what it is, propaganda, the footage and production values are first rate. Except for the already noted annoying mis-pronunciation of Soviet. Or, if he is one, perhaps WE are wrong.",1524614400,,390,5.306451612903226
8253792,3,B00140PKBY,"The listing claims its a 2013 video but it was originally released on video tape in 1988. The narrator has an old school British documentary narration voice. Its an interesting video but hard to watch because of the interlacing hard coded into the video, not to mention having been made for video tape.",1524355200,,302,4.716981132075472
8253793,1,B00140PKBY,"I can't stand to listen to the narrator call it the Saviot Union, like nails on a chalkboard. It's an O not an A.",1523059200,3,113,3.75
8253794,3,B00140PKBY,"Very dated, I think the claims of the Soviet aircraft are a bit optimistic at best. The systems are not 10 years ahead of the other countries and the avionics in the west are quite a bit better than those of the Soviets. You can see a major problem with mig-29 is that the engines smoke especially during a turn, never a good thing. The only US aircraft with this problem is the B-52. That being said I learned a lot and enjoyed the video. There is a problem with the Hind in that during tight turns it has a tendency  to chop off the tail. Also the stinger is not a perfect weapon but is much more effective than was said.",1519603200,,623,4.10655737704918
8253795,4,B00140PKBY,"Lots of fun, many, many aircraft are shown and described. This *is* a propaganda film, but shouldn't detract from the all the details given at the end of the 80s about Soviet air power, before that wall came down. I'd love to see more. In fact, I'd love to see an American equivalent. (the US *never* engaged in propaganda itself, did it? <wink>)",1517356800,,346,4.507936507936508
8253796,5,B00140PKBY,I really liked it. Well done and interesting with some really good views of the aircraft in flight.,1475452800,,99,4.555555555555555

8253798,5,B00140PKBY,"Fantastic DVD for those who are into Soviet aircraft.  It gives a little history on the Soviet Union and then it describes the steps Soviet pilots go through in order to fly for the VVS. The footage includes the Mig 21, Mig 23, Mig 25, Mig 27, Mig 29, AN 124, attack helicopters, Tu-95 Bear and SAM operations. Most of the footage I had never seen before and they are all from the 70s and 80s. The Mig 29 and AN 124 footage is from the 1988 Farnborough airshow. Well worth having in your collection if you are into Soviet planes.",1365465600,,529,4.237623762376238
