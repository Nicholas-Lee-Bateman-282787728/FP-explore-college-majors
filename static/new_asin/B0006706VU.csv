8039465,5,B0006706VU,"I bought these DVDs for my nephews two years ago and they loved them.  My son, who is now 2, has been in love with these DVDs since he was 18 months.  We will be lucky if he doesn't wear the DVD out.  This is the PERFECT child introduction to golf.  If your child is like mine and enjoys sports, he/she will love this DVD.  Our son has learned so much, specifically with this DVD he is picking up the understanding of what a golf course is and how to hit the ball with his platic golf clubs.  I now give one of these DVD in the Tiny Tots Sports series to every child we go to a party for.  We have received 100% positive feedback from the parents about how much thier child loves it and where could they get more.  The best part has been watching my son swinging to hit the ball with his golf club and yelling ""four"".  He is picking up the basics about the sport while learning how to have fun!  Thank you Tiny Tots.. you give my husband and I a good 30 minutes of fun and education for our son every day!  I can't wait for spring so he can get outside and play again!  Coach Coati Rocks (he is the series mascot)!",1202256000,,1114,3.990950226244344
8039466,1,B0006706VU,"I want my money back! What a waste of time for both myself and my son! It is so poorly put together that if you WANT your child to like golf, don't make him watch this video!!!!",1144627200,2,177,3.810810810810811
8039467,1,B0006706VU,"I recently got this DVD as a gift and had to turn it off after not even one viewing. It does nothing to teach kids about golf, the proper way to play or behave on a golf course.  It looks like it was cheaply put together and the production is second rate. I do not recommend this DVD or any in the series. There are plenty of other golf and sport DVDs out there that do a MUCH better job, so don't waste your money here!",1132185600,2,420,3.883720930232558
8039468,1,B0006706VU,"I purchased this DVD for my 3 1/2 year old son thinking it might help him learn a little bit about the game of golf, with some instructions on how to swing. However, this DVD turned out to be a bunch of kids driving around in miniature battery operated golf carts doing what ever they want, and chasing some guy dressed up in a bad wolf costume. Also, if you want your kids to learn some golf etiquette, this is defiantly not the DVD for you, the children on the video for the most part are left to do whatever they want on a golf course, including driving the carts around on greens. No educational value, great for babies who want to watch children swing clubs hap hazardly and watch an ugly wolf run around.",1122854400,4,710,4.266666666666667
8039469,4,B0006706VU,"My wife dragged me to a baby show in Jersey when we were visiting relatives last week.  Picked this DVD up with a little companion book.  Kyle...my 3 yr odl son loves.  I'm getting tired of all the other videos.  They're fine with shapes and colors, but this one is fun and has other kids...and all the colors and shapes and sports.  Kathy groaned when i bought a golf video, but even she likes it...the book is good for kids.  We got football and basketball now too.  They're great.  Football has cheerleaders that are cute too.",1101081600,,529,4.4375
