8424954,4,B004D8VFNG,"I liked all parts of the movie, but this was not his best work.  Of course, when you've seen many of his movies, you understand that not all of them can be perfect.",1373241600,4,164,3.9696969696969697
8424955,5,B004D8VFNG,"Mario Moreno Cantinflas from Mexico, this is one the great movies he made, you will laugh a lot. Just looking his body language is fantastic. You will enjoy if you know Spanish, but even you understand a little you will laugh. Charles Chaplin call him the best comedian in the world. And you will agree after seeing the movie. Happy laughs.",1353456000,6,340,4.590163934426229
