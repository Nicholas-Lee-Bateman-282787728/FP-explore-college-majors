1353332,5,B00004U0FQ,If you want humor without filth...this guy is it.  He is funny without trying to be funny...There is simply not enough of Jonathan Winters work out there.. Wished there were more like him.,1370217600,,188,4.696969696969697
1353333,5,B00004U0FQ,It bought back fond memories of days when I was  kid and tried never to miss a show where JW would appear.,1368662400,,106,3.8181818181818183
1353334,1,B00004U0FQ,I thought I was getting a Jonathan Winters performance. I got a DVD of useless commentary from others telling me what a great comedian he was. I knew that.....Jim Perdue,1367712000,3,169,4.666666666666667
1353335,4,B00004U0FQ,"An incredibly gifted humorist from Bellbrook, Ohio, Jonathon's most memorable improvisations were a bit on the risque side. Too bad this material has been sanatized to General Audience level, as he was at his funniest in ""no holds barred"" performance situations. I have a reel to reel tape I got from a fellow admirer of Mr. Winters in the 1960's that is delightfully irreverant and off color. Future generations may never know, with this DVD alone, how truly incandescent he was.",1259107200,4,480,4.938271604938271
1353336,3,B00004U0FQ,"They short changed the reason we all get this video: Jonathan's performances. Granted, the docufiller is interesting, but belongs in a section titled ""Bonus Feature"", or ""Bio"" rather than fragmenting some entertaining out takes.

Probably didn't want to pay all the royalties to get more performances included...

Recommend as a rental rather than a purchase.",1171411200,15,359,5.509090909090909
1353337,4,B00004U0FQ,"Jonathan Winters is probably my all-time favorite comedian!  I liked this video but wish it had been longer and that many, many more of his comedy routines had been included.  The clips were too scattered and too brief, and it just whetted my appetite for more and was frustrating.  Appearances by Andy Williams and Robin Williams didn't add much.  I did enjoy learning a little about Winters' personal life over the years, and seeing him as he was a couple years ago.  I must say I was very glad to locate ANY video about him, but it would be wonderful if someone could put together a complete set of ALL of his routines!  That would be fantastic!",1092787200,40,648,4.495726495726496
1353338,5,B00004U0FQ,"This is a video which is sometimes shown on PBS. It is biographical in nature and truly shows the breadth of his comedy. You'll see Winters as you've probably never seen him before. There is improvisational humor galore and there's also black humor (The Execution). It is very amusing to see the ""Straight Men"" so totally lost and just enjoying ""the master"" at work.",994032000,14,366,4.734375
1353339,2,B00004U0FQ,"Jonathan Winters is really a treasure and it is amazing how many people do not know about him.  He is clearly Robin Williams's progenitor, starting out in his television career with sound effects and impersonations, but eventually moving into original characters and amazing improvisations, often based on random objects thrown to him.
This documentary, however, is constantly teasing the viewer who is eager to watch the master.  Seldom does a segment or vignette go uninterrupted by cuts from interviews which are sparse, heavy on adoration and low on information.  The subjects of these interviews are limited to Andy Williams, Robin Williams (who seems to have little to say about his hero), and family members who tell few stories.  Winters himself makes a statement about his nervous breakdown and hospitalization that is firm and uninformative.  There is talk about the work on IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD and MORK AND MINDY but no clips.  Even when we watch him at play in public places, the camera holds so closely on him, rarely showing the setting or the people he is catching off-guard, that the spontaneity of what we are witnessing is hidden.
A little of Winters is vastly better than none, but this disappoints as a documentary.",993945600,70,1247,4.971153846153846

7923323,3,B00004U0FQ,"I gave this DVD three stars instead of two because I love Jonathan Winters.  But I found the included skits a bit droll.  When I was an early teen and first saw Jonathan, I cracked my sides so hard I almost bled.  Rather than think I've grown too sophisticated to enjoy Jonathan's humor anymore, I'd rather think that the producers of this DVD didn't get their hands on the right stuff. If I'd seen it before buying it, I wouldn't have bought it.  And I don't recommend it.",1381622400,2,473,4.340909090909091
