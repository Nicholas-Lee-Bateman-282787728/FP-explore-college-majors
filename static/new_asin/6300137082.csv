I really wish they would start coming out with DVD 1st seaon, 2nd season, 3rd season, etc etc. As i think these would go over real well with people who want to buy the entire serive with a once a month release date.
I still really enjoy the VHS, and the TV show when i was a child.",1063670400,6,437,4.0344827586206895
