8194040,1,B00008G82N,"This DVD is probably the worst I have purchased.  I knew from reviews that Deadly harvest was marginal in creative quality, but Embryo has probably the worst resolution I have seen on DVDs.  I did not even finish watching it since the picture quality was so poor.  Poor quality productions like that should not be sold.  The DVD price was $2.42 plus $3.99 shipping.  I thought the low price was for the marginal quality of the story, but I had watched Embryo in the past which was an OK movie.  It isn't worth the price for return shipping. So, I will dispose of it.",1504310400,,566,4.394230769230769
