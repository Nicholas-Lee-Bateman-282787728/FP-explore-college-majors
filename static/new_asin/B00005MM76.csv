1626988,1,B00005MM76,"I ordered this and got a version from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, not the version in the Amazon product listing. This is a cotinuing problem if you order used Hong Kong films. You order the film used and don't get the advertised version and instead get a cheap (maybe even illegal) copy. It is a grainy pixalated version with blurry lines across the screen. Amazon really needs to crack down on this and make them specify or ensure that you only get the advertised version.",1071446400,16,473,4.642857142857143

7945813,1,B00005MM76,"I waited to receive this copy from the US,and when I checked it out it was very bad quality. Thick of the worst video you have,and I think you can understand. I certainly won't be buying anything off this studio again. I do recommend dvds from Red Sun,Hong Kong Legends and Vengeance Video are ok.

The film is a masterpiece of classic kung fu,but the quality is dire. I hope Red Sun release it.",1165536000,4,395,4.337837837837838
7945814,1,B00005MM76,"Just received the DVD and watched the opening scenes.  That was enough for me.  First off, I blame myself for thinking the ""36th Chamber"" was the original classic ""Master Killer.""  Simply put, the video quality is totally unacceptable.  Its the same or worse than recording at the slowest speed on a VCR.",1133222400,5,304,4.788461538461538
7945815,1,B00005MM76,"I have two reviews for this movie. the first is the film itself and the second is on the actually copy.

This movie is a great Kung fu classic. The title I am more familiar with is ""Return to the 36th chamber"" aka ""Return of the Master Killer""

36 chambers usually refers to the first one. Aka ""the master killer of Shaolin. or just ""master killer""

That being said I do really like this movie and feel that everyone should own it... just not this copy.

Now for the copy being sold here...

the image is so poor it is difficult to watch. it is very grainy the color is off and the cropping is horrible.

My recomedation for anyone really into classic kung fu movies is to pick up a region free player and buy the Hong Kong remastered versions by Celestial released by Intercontinental Video Limited

or Deltamac",1122940800,13,812,4.373333333333333
7945816,1,B00005MM76,"First of all the DVD inside is not the famous ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"". It is ""Return to the 36th Chamber"", sequel to the original movie.

The Video quality is so poor that I think it is a pirated copy.

I cannot believe Amazon can sell such item.",1117843200,6,248,4.145833333333333
7945817,5,B00005MM76,Someone help me with the celestial pictures thing. I would get it if i knew how. SO SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME!!!!!!!!,1109894400,4,114,4.476190476190476
7945818,1,B00005MM76,I was most surprised to receive what is obviously a pirated copy of this film.  The cover is a cheap print out which does not even fit properly in the box.  The quality of the movie is absolutely appaling - like some cheap 80's pirate video.  Do not buy this film!!!,1098057600,35,266,4.176470588235294
7945819,1,B00005MM76,"The only REAL version of this stunning film is the version distributed by Celestial Pictures themselves in their Shaw Brothers Collection.
Don't buy anything else than that.",1089504000,14,173,5.444444444444445
