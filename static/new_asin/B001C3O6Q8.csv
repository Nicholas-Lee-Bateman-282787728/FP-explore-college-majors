3503920,5,B001C3O6Q8,From start to finish non-stop fighting. If your a UFC love and anime lover. You will love this anime. I wanted to see more after this title was over. I would be the first in line fora season 3 if one ever comes out.,1222473600,,215,3.909090909090909
3503921,5,B001C3O6Q8,"I have been trying to find a worthy sequel, or knock off, to Fist Of The North Star and Baki is about the only one that comes close; the action is fast, brutal, relentless and heart pounding. Many different martial arts are shown, the story is moving at times and boring at others, but what really moves this series is its no holds barred action scenes, and there are so many of them!
I highly reccomend Baki, Evangelion fans need not apply as this is not a ""brainic"" (read absolutely boring) type of anime, but everyone else will most likely love Baki the Grappler.",1221350400,,566,4.451923076923077
3503922,5,B001C3O6Q8,"""Baki the Grappler"" is 48 episodes of some of the best animated fight sequences I've ever seen.  There is a story, but it only serves the purpose of propelling the characters into combat with one another.  The simplistic story is kept alive by the wealth of interesting and fully fleshed-out characters that inhabit Baki's world.  Each fighter has a unique persoality, backstory, fighting style, and motivation to be the world's strongest martial-artist.  The battles are intense, the art is typically great, and the theme song really gets your blood pumping.  This is the best show of it's kind and should really scratch an itch for MMA (Mixed Martial-Arts) fanatics.

 Essentially, Baki Hanma is the son of the word's strongest fighter, Yujiro Hanma (aka ""The Ogre""); a man who kills polar bears with his bare hands just for the fun of it, a man who can easily overcome a fully armed battalion of soldiers through sheer martial-arts prowess and cunning, a man so ridiculously strong...well you get the idea: he's a bad mutha (shut'cho mouth!).  Baki's mother, desperately in love, wants nothing more than to be loved in return by this beast of man and she plans to use her son to make it happen.  She figures if Baki can be the best fighter in the world, Yujiro will come sweep her off her feet and they can all live happily ever after rather than The Ogre's usual ""knock 'em up and ditch 'em"" approach to romance.  Women have some weird logic sometimes.  So Baki trains.  A lot.  We first meet him at age 13 challenging 100 gang members to a fight...all at once.  He only gets 30 or so before going down (sissy) and decides that his state-of-the-art training facility isn't enough; he needs some real experience to become stronger.  So begins our hero's journey through the brutal world of martial-arts, each opponent stronger than the last, each teaching him valuable lessons, and each becoming a valued friend.

Season one is the weaker of the two as it deals with Baki's childhood.  I don't much care for his character model at this point and watching him fight a giant monkey (one who supposedly ate Mushashi Myamoto, no less) is just a little bit goofy. Still, the story gathers a lot of steam as it goes and culminates in a fateful duel with his villainous father that sets a brutal tone for the real attraction: season two.

The second season is truly outstanding.  All attempts at standard story-telling are thrown out the window and the show truly becomes all about the fights.  It takes place during an underground fighting tournament (think Kumite) that Baki -as the current champ- is favored to win.  Every single match is shown beginning to end (no cheesy montages), every single character has an interesting style and has their story revealed to us bit-by-bit via flashback, and we even get the behind-the-scenes drama to boot.  My favorite character, one-eyed karate-master Orochi Doppo, while being a man known for slaying tiger bare-handed, never misses an opportunity to wave at his nervous wreck of a wife with a big smile on his face. This is one thing I find very endearing about this series; the way even the fiercest martial-artists are shown as real human beings, not just obstacles for the hero to overcome.

The fights themselves are remarkably unpredictable and feature some great twists and brutal, blood-splattering action.  While the action is obviously beefed up (this IS an anime) most of the moves are actual martial-arts techniques and the ones that are over-the-top are much more interesting than the DBZ nonsense most fighting anime devolves into.  Sumo, judo, jujitsu, pro-wrestling, kenpo, karate, straight street-fighting, and more are all explored and displayed along with some history and philosophy lessons for each woven into the dialogue.  Martial-arts fans will flip at how much respect is shown to each fighting style and at the conflicts that develop between them.  Can modern Japanese karate defeat it's ancient parental Chinese art and finally claim it's independence?  Can pure strength and technique defeat the heart of a true warrior whose only fight training was out on the streets?  Baki and his new love interest get largely lost in the ensemble in season two, but with a cast this strong I really didn't care. I was absolutely riveted by the tournament unfolding before me. It took a lot of guts for the show to take the focus entirely off of the title character, but it worked out great and turned ""Baki the Grappler"" into something really special for fans of real fighting.

 Baki is the consummate hero; powerful, resourceful, a ruthless and determined combatant, but kind-hearted and a respectful sportsman who never fails to befriend his opponent after the last punch is thrown.  You can't not like this guy and his ""Total Fighting"" MMA style allows for great flexibility in how he tackles each opponent.  I was a little bummed that the obvious finale of the show never happened -the final episode was an entirely stand-alone affair dealing with Yujiro's past (it did, however, kick total a$z)- but on the other hand an open-ended finish is a good finish.  The fact is, there is no greater animated series for fighting fans.  The first season starts off a little slow, but you will likely be cheering by the mid-way point of season two.  As far as bonus features go: each disc comes with a list of character profiles and some art.  Not exactly overwhelming, but it's something.

 Baki the Grappler is a 48 episode anime series which ran in 2001 and I believe it made it to the states in 2005. The series is not to be confused with the original Grappler Baki 45 minute OVA released in 1994, despite both of them being based on Keisuke Itagaki's manga. In fact, the TV series has nothing to do with the original OVA therefore it's perfectly fine to come into this series fresh. Now, I'll just come out the gate and say that Baki the Grappler is still among the best martial arts anime an action fan can come into. For me it's number three right behind Fighting Spirit aka Hajime No Ippo and Shura No Toki. In regards to action, Baki the Grappler is very close to their equal, however it falls tremendously in a face off between the other two in regards to story. To be blunt, as the story moves further, Baki the Grappler begins to suffer. In all fairness though, this all depends on who you talk to. In any case, if you're looking for action free of that Dragon Ball Z style of ""powering up"", constant reused cels, and battles being stretched far too long, then this is the anime series for you.

 Baki the Grappler can best be described as MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) anime style. For the most part this anime is all about the fight, as the viewer will be treated to vicious displays of many disciplines such as Chinese kung fu, Kempo, Boxing, Pro Wrestling, Karate, and just so many different types with an exaggerated anime twist. The great part about this is that the viewer will be treated to some detailed, bone crushing action and even some background on these arts, which can also be exaggerated as well but makes it no less fun to get into.

 Baki the Grappler is broken up into two chapters; the first 24 episodes follows Baki as he tries to improve as a fighter by taking on gangs, street brawlers, and even a professional middleweight boxer. This portion is a bit more story driven as Baki also wants to impress his mother in order to earn her love; the anime does a very good job playing with its themes of love, acceptance, and especially respect and friendship through fighting. I love how the anime explores things beyond the bloodshed, and shows that some rivals can move on pass defeat towards understanding each other. Those out there whom practice some type of discipline will find quite a bit of enjoyment in places other than the fights.

 The second half of the series takes place five years after Baki's brutal battle with an unstoppable opponent; this time he returns to Japan and enters the SFC (Supreme Fighting Circuit) which is underground pit fights in a large arena. The second chapter is called the Great Tournament Saga, and here Baki is placed in a 30 man tournament and this is where the action truly becomes outstanding. This part of the anime is awesome beyond words if over the top action is your thing. Many of these fighters receive good face time for growth and their styles can be mind blowing. There's one fighter who's real job is a surgeon in a hospital, and he applies his craft through fighting to surgically break down opponents. There's even a very brutal, steroid user who cuts loose in the sickest of ways. There's so much to enjoy action wise I can't imagine anyone getting bored with the fights.

 The series attempts to develop many of these characters through flashbacks and dialog, and this is where the story will fall for some people. This portion mainly follows these fighters as they seek to win the championship and there is very little beyond that. Baki is still the star here with his own drive, but at least one thing involving him takes a backseat. Therefore, if you're looking for something complex then forget about it. However, the anime still explores its themes through different ways and some of these moments can be a bit heart warming.

 One of the biggest reasons why I enjoy this anime so much is because of its consistent tone. The comedic segments can be seen as dark humor and at times pretty light; the anime never drifts towards feeling like something else, which is something you don't get often in this day and age. There are no perverted scenes, out of place panty shots, or lecherous old men just to ""lighten up the mood"". Even the gay male is more than tolerable, in fact he is likeable because he's not the girly comedic type. It's nice to see that a gay character doesn't have to fall back on too many of the most wretched cliches. This is the anime for people with ""no sense of humor"".

 Among the anime's flaws concerning story; the open ending which leaves room for a third season that still hasn't come around is still a bother, because a couple of major things are left in the air. Plus in the first chapter especially, there are just moments of idiotic writing to push the plot. Normally, in fact almost always I would have a big problem with these things, but everything else is so good that I can't knock this series very much, and this anime has just aged well because there are a lot of bad titles out there.

The animation does an excellent job most of the time concerning the fights. The anime reuses cels sparingly and tries its best to provide detailed, hard hitting action. Blows to the jaw and many other places to the body can almost be felt through the screen, that's how detailed this series can be when played loud. People's jaws and ribs are broken, teeth knocked clean out, legs broken, the action fiend's bloodlust will be satisfied. The action steps out of the realm of realism a lot to the point where these guys are super human, but it's still so much fun to watch. Now on the negative side, the animation can be very bad at times with very inconsistent and deformed character designs, plus it lowers in quality more towards the end. While the soundtrack can be enjoyable with a rocking, blood pumping opening BGM; it gets old since there are no new tracks at any time. The voice acting for the English dub was done very well for me, and there's really no one I care to point out since they were all enjoyable.

 Baki the Grappler is one of the very few long series I can still watch from start to finish. The action is awesome, I like the characters, it's tonally consistent and completely free of the usual comedic elements that destroys most anime. If this anime sounds at all close to something you will watch then I recommend giving it a try.

Pros: Lots of awesome action, some really cool characters

Cons: Ending not that satisfying, mixed feelings on animation",1396483200,2,6870,4.5124698310539015

3503927,5,B001C3O6Q8,"Tons of fighting just enough plot to justify the constant fist poundings, yes for the most part some of the story line is fairly flimsy, a mother not insisting her son go to school a focus on fighting, why is Baki poor in the second half of the movie? but whatever were here for the fighting good series ends a bit abruptly though.",1391299200,,331,4.26984126984127
3503928,5,B001C3O6Q8,"Unapologetic, face smashing fan service.  This show kicks ass.  If you're a student or fan of martial arts, it will have you in heaven or at the gym, quickly.  Let's get to it.

***PROS***

ANIMATION/ACTION:
The fight choreography in Baki is the best.  The entire show is centered on the human body and martial arts (both real and fiction).  There are some 3 frame movements and some weak character design, but only when the cast isn't beating the crap out of each other.  When they are its animated smoothly, and viciously.  A lot of fans are attracted to martial arts, and heavy action anime.  While most series pose this plus, they rarely deliver in large amounts.  Bleach, for example, has one-hit-one-kills, and 2 minute battles placed at the end of each episode.  Baki is the real deal.  The show focuses generously on destroying and how to destroy better.  If you have an overly macho friend who just can't seem to get behind anime, then treat him to this.

CHARACTERS:
The characters are priceless and over the top.  Each fighter boasts an interesting attitude that resembles his style of martial art, and their back stories are the stuff of legend.  Baki's family tree alone is unimaginable.  His mother is a plus 10 hottie, who's evil, totally negligent to Baki, and only cares when he's excelling in combat.  His father's back muscles are so ripped, that they make the face of a demon when flexed, and he spends his spare time bringing whole armies to their knees, and cracking bear skulls in between his ass cheeks.  Baki showcases a peculiar and wonderful attitude about fighting.  If he gets punched in the face, he's usually happy it was a great punch and very grateful for the lesson.  Little depth, lots of fun.

MARTIAL ARTS:
The study of martial arts is the center of the show.  There are 48 episodes that dive deep into the core of many different forms of the arts.  Styles are pitted against each other so we can see the best they have to offer.  2/3's of what you see in Baki is actual martial arts; the other 3rd is fiction, but usually fiction that comes from ancient stories.  The show is a textbook full of moves.

***CONS***

STORY:
The story is simple and straight forward.  You're not going to unravel a new level of consciousness, but you will unravel a new method to deliver unconsciousness.  It ends a little flat, but you'll forgive it.

All in all, Baki is a runaway train with clenched fists for passengers.  KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING.  If you want action, some good laughs and an excuse to hit the gym, or even better, to join a martial arts dojo, then mount up.  With all the anime out there claiming great action, but delivering less, Baki is a welcome product.

I much more enjoyed the first season.  The second season wasn't as anywhere near as good as the first, in my opinion, but still decent to watch.

As an added note, my japanese isn't good enough for first hand knowledge, but my friend yasuo once told me that in the Baki Manga the kanji (chinese characters) that are used are so deep and intertwined with the philosophy of martial arts that Baki is far more than just the story of a fighter.",1286668800,,687,4.206106870229007

The fighting styles of each character really differ from one another making each battle different and unique. The story pales in places but not enough to affect overall. For the price (which was about 20 bucks for me) it's simply unbeatable, it may lack story elements that other more deep anime shows contain but it more than makes up for it with great characters and amazing fights.",1267747200,,552,4.760416666666667

3503940,4,B001C3O6Q8,"I gave it a 4 stars because of its incomplete ending. Yes, it has an incomplete ending, but I won't say what kinda ending it is.

It is, however, a great fighting anime that puts you over the edge. Has some strategic, thought out battles. Battles are awesome and the storyline is okay, simple but in a good way in my opinion. I mean, it's not exactly a mystery anime that has complicated, twisted plots.

The artwork is interesting, the guy has a baby face in the first season. My gf laughs a lot when she sees his face. The proportions of their bodies are completely unrealistic though, but it's a made up anime, it is to be expected I suppose. The artwork is a bit inaccurate, there's a 15 year o' kid that has a 30-40 year old's body and face.

Warning though, it is extremely violent and bloody anime. Buy it for your little kids if you are a bad parent. If you're into violent fighting animes, this is the one for you.",1235865600,,923,4.2628571428571425

8285758,4,B001C3O6Q8,"I discovered Baki through endless previews on my Dragonball Z discs. The show is good, but the Seasons are very different from each other. Season One takes us on Baki's journey through his dysfunctional family (Mom is a shallow, selfish rich girl/Dad is a fiendish, violent demonic man) and his pursuit of being the best grappler. There is an ongoing story here, with Baki at the center. (More on that later!) Along the way, he befriends some cool characters, including Hanyama and Doppo. (More on that later!) Baki's fight with his father, Yujiro, is a turning point in the series and is well-told. The Second Season is a 24 episode tournament. Knowing that, this season can be entertaining. The various fighters backstories are intriguing; and the various fighting styles are explained. Yujiro is as baddass as ever. The Jack Xamma character is fascinating. HOWEVER, the Second Season has some flaws--Hanyama becomes an ex-friend.  But the most significant weakness of this year is Baki himself. He is basically a spectator with a few fights. Baki is also drawn as a slack-jawed , droopy-eyed dufus most of the time. He looks like a druggie.  His ""girlfriend"" is no more than window dressing. And on that note: This show is very violent. Definitely for mature audiences. Yet there is no romance between Baki and his ""girl"" (no, I don't mean sex) At one point, Baki walks right past her as if she isn't even there.  My point is, if Baki was more interesting; and the show had pushed the envelope harder, there may have been a Third Season. The closing themes (one for each season) and all incidental music scores are excellent. On the other hand, the opening theme is horrible! Just loud, screeching and screaming. I mute it every time! (To be fair, it may be a gender gap--I'm 58.)  Packaging/artwork of the DVD's are the best of anything I have ever purchased.",1420934400,,1863,4.794392523364486
