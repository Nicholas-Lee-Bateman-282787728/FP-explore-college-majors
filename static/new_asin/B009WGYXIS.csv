5370122,4,B009WGYXIS,"Frankenstein (Luke Goss) is up for his final race for his freedom. In a hostile take over Weyland (Ving Rhames) has sold the company which sponsors the races to Niles York (Dougray Scott) an immediately unlikeable person. Niles plans to franchise Death Race around the globe, but to have an audience he needs Frankenstein. Frankenstein is given the ultimatum by Niles: Lose or Die.

The race takes place in South Africa through friendly and unfriendly shanty towns as well as desert. Frankenstein races against people who would rather see him dead than win the race. Names like: Razor, Nero, Joker, Pretty Boy, Olga, and Psycho. Prior to the race the female navigators are placed in a caged death match as 16 Xena looking/dressed women fight each other until 10 are left.

There is a quick flashback to explain Frankenstein, but it is short. The film has plenty of inane ""explode on contact"" action, racing, hot babes and a twist. Break out the popcorn.

5370124,4,B009WGYXIS,"The storyline outside of the racing makes little sense, but it's entertaining.",1505520000,,78,5.583333333333333
5370125,4,B009WGYXIS,"A great action flick can be great with all of the right people to star in it, direct it, write it etc, providing great ideas for the plot, characters, and scenes, and for what it's worth the right resources.  In so many respects than not, this movie hit those marks with flying colors thereby offering a far more satisfying and entertaining chapter this time. This chapter delivers on its every promise in spades by upping the ante.

A simple plot summary of the movie:  Corporate businessman R.H. Weyland(Ving Rames) gets the rights to Death Race taken over by a rich, young, business opportunist playboy, named Niles York(Dougray Scott).  York has epic plans to take Death Race beyond just Terminal Island Prison by taking it globally and also looking for other prisons to bring Death Race to.  Carl ""Frankenstein"" Lucas gets highly affective plastic surgery and makes some secret business arrangements with Weyland.  His pit crew of highly talkative but lovable stats boy Lists(Frederick Koehler), his Mexican/Jewish mechanic Goldberg(Danny Trejo), and his smokin' hot Navigator/girlfriend Katrina Banks(Tanit Phoenix) all get wind of Lucas having survived his accident when his Frankenstein mask falls off during a scuffle between his friends and himself fighting off some vicious inmates.  Upset with Lucas's playing dead(even though he had no choice in the matter) Lists, Goldberg, and Katrina, are initially reluctant to help him out.  Now there is a new sexy hostess named Salinas taking on the show alongside Niles York in the new location in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.  The prisoners/racers are all implanted with homing devices so that they don't try to run away.  Outside of miles and miles of desert and really rough sand dunes, heavy heat, and other deadly challenges await Frankenstein and company as they race to fight and survive through their such uncompromising circumstances.

What made this chapter so great is the way that this time the makers of this movie decide to get right down to the brass tacks and offer alot more action, explosives, still offering really hot women for eye-candy, much more scenes of racing, naturally, and more drama for the main characters.

  Luke Goss and Danny Trejo still deliver on the excellent performances and laughs at times.  Frederick Koehler(Lists) was half way decent as always.  Tanit Phoenix was gorgeous, very sexy, and put in a much more memorable performance this time around.  Even as Ving Rames(RH Weyland) isn't in this movie any more than he was in the last one, his character Weyland at least gets to do more in this movie this time.  Dougray Scott(Niles York) was ambitiously evil, conniving, manipulative, energetic, sleazy, and always having his finger on the button both figuratively and literally, making him a villain to contend with.  He needed a bit more charisma though.

The action scenes involving a rough and violent race while going through these bright white desert sands without weapons, racing through a town of vicious criminals out to give the Death Race racers a tough time, some anti-Death Race protesters, and just the desperate racing convicts in general of whom are prepared to win even if they feel the need to fight dirty all make for some awesome edge of your seat action.

The fight choreography between Luke Goss(Lucas), Goldberg(Danny Trejo), and 14 K(Robin Shou) among others and these nasty other inmates and the somewhat sexy yet deadly fight between the sexy Navigators was twice as great and exciting choreography.

While the drama between Carl ""Frankenstein"" Lucas's friends and crew and himself was a bit aggravating as they refused to listen to his good reasons for playing dead, it did make the characters somewhat deeper.  Also, as Lucas wanted to do whatever he could to make total amends with them plus all of the things that he does for them at the end of the movie(Don't worry I won't spoil what it is that he does for them), his character remarkably becomes redeemable in a way that he had not been previously.

My only complaints are that just like the last movie the female nudity is barely shown.  Also while the gore was improved some it still proved flawed.

In closing, if you are into the first Death Race movie, enjoy watching people race eachother, love lots of action, stunts, and explosions, love looking at sexy and attractive women, if you are a fan of Dougray Scott, Luke Goss, or Danny Trejo, love awesome fight choreography, enjoy character building drama, love added humor, and above all want to just plain have an awesome movie experience that Blu-Ray truly brings to life, then this movie is for you.

Listen, I'm almost seventy. But I never grew up. I live near THE, actual, Frankenstein
castle---in Bavaria---I put on my mask... that matches my blue eyes, and race to my
home-away-from-home in our, local, Mercedes' bus. The metal mask in THESE films
doesn't look very comfortable! Mine fits just fine! Look close on the bus's destination!

I have a nice home theatre with a Bose 5.1 surround system...
I don't need one of those 7.1 ; 9.1 ; or ATMOS surround-hookups.
WOULD like one of those rockin' 'n' rollin' theater chairs, though!

5370138,3,B009WGYXIS,This franchise has a great opportunity here and seem to keep missing the mark. I like this movie - it's ok.  I've enjoyed the first one back in the 70's when my brother first introduced me to death race 2000 when he came home after seeing the flick at the local drive in theatre.  You would think after all these year the new franchise would give us so much more and  yet it feels like your driving on a half empty tire when viewing this and the rest of the flicks associated with the 1- 2 and 3 series.  I feel like I'm going back in time versus forward and this is a hueg disappointment for many reasons.  It's the future for crying out loud and the sets appear as if they are from the early 70's...just isn't working for me anymore bro. STEP IT UP!,1490400000,,751,4.116438356164384

5370195,4,B009WGYXIS,"I vaguely remember seeing bits & pieces of Roger Corman's original ""Death Race 2000"" as a little kid at our local drive-in (specifically where a fisherman gets run over). Growing up it was a film a returned to quite often, I loved the whole concept, and the tongue-in-cheek exploitation, the over-the-top gore, gratuitous nudity....it was a blast then, and it's still holds up today. When the remake was announced, I was actually interested to see where they could go with it. While I missed the corny fun of the original, I did like ""Death Race"". It was a cool action flick which updated to premise. When I saw ""Death Race 2"" pop up on my Netflix, I decided to give it a shot, and found that I liked it even more than the first film. Last weekend I'm popping around on Netflix looking for something to watch when I see there is a 3rd film in the rebooted series.

""Death Race 3: Inferno"" begins with Ving Rhames' character, Weyland, losing the ""Death Race"" franchise to Niles York, a billionaire that hopes to take the ""Death Race"" Pay Per View global. York wants the first new ""Death Race"" to take place in desert sands of Africa. Fearing that he will lose his star attraction, the masked driver known as ""Frankenstein"", York arranges for Frankenstein to race, but warns him that he must lose, otherwise York will have him killed. Needing only one more win to gain his freedom, Frankenstein doesn't plan on losing.

These movies are fun, and if you are looking for something ""serious"", then keep looking. If you just want a fun shoot-'em-up with cool stunts, and lots of explosions...then you've come to the right place. Moving the action outside, and to a new location gives this entry in the series a new look and presents some new obstacles which the drivers must overcome. With Danny Trejo in a great supporting roll, and Luke Goss in the lead, this movie is too fun to miss.",1412035200,,1881,4.595238095238095

If you win a certain amount of races, you allegedly are freed from jail. Lucas is only one win away from being freed. However, now the track has changed from asphalt to sand!

5370239,4,B009WGYXIS,"The ""Death Race"" films have been around since 1975.  From the original ""Death Race 2000 film directed by Paul Bartel and starring David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone which was inspired by Ib Melchior's short story ""The Racer"", the cult film would eventually find new life in 2008.

The remake by director Paul W.S. Anderson which starred Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson and Joan Allen did well in the box office and would ensure a direct-to-DVD sequel in 2011 titled ""Death Race 2 starring Luke Goss (""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"", ""Blade II"", ""The Man""),  Ving Rhames (""Pulp Fiction"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Mission: Impossible"" films), Danny Trejo (""Machete"", ""Grindhouse"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Con Air""), Frederick Koehler (""Kate & Allie"", ""Mr. Mom"", ""Death Race"") and Tanit Phoenix (""Lord of War"", ""Safe House"", ""Lost Boys: The Thirst"").  And also featured Dougray Scott (""Mission: Impossible 2, ""Hitman"", ""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"") as the primary antagonist in the film.

And the cast from the second film returns once again for the direct-to-video Blu-ray and 3D Blu-ray release of ""Death Race 3: Inferno - Unrated"". Both the rated and unrated version of the film will be included on each Blu-ray release.

The film was directed by Roel Reine (""The Delivery"", ""Death Race 2, ""The Scorpion 3: Battle for Redemption"") and written by Tony Giglio (""Death Race 2, ""Timber Falls"", ""Chaos"").

To explain what ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" is about, we need to go back to the original film.  In 2012, the economy of the USA has collapsed, unemployment and crime skyrockets and prisons become privatized and for profit.

One prison on Terminal Island has come up with a plan to make profit through a pay-per-view broadcast of a modern gladiator game known as ""Death Race"" and those who can win five races will be granted freedom by the Warden.

In the first film, we were introduced to a masked driver named Frankenstein (played by David Carradine, who starred in the original 1975 film ""Death Race 2000).  A man named Jensen Ames (portrayed by Jason Statham) was convicted for a crime he didn't commit and because Frankenstein, who is very popular with the audience, had died, to keep the legend alive and the ratings to be at its all time high, Jensen Ames takes on the identity of Frankenstein.

Jensen Ames manages to escape prison with a few others, but continuing the prisons wanting to keep the legend of Frankenstein alive and the ratings high, The Weyland Corporation which hosts the Death Match and owns Terminal Island, continues the ""Death Race"".

In the second film, we were introduced to Carl ""Luke"" Lucas (portrayed by Luke Goss), a Getaway driver arrested for a crime that had gone wrong.  He eventually becomes a ""Death Race"" racer and his pit crew included the tech savvy Lists (portrayed by Frederick Koehler), the rough Goldberg (portrayed by Danny Trejo) and a female convict named Katrina Banks (portrayed by Tanit Phoenix).  Suffice to say, Luke has a $1 million bounty put on his head courtesy of his old crime boss.

An explosion occurs and everyone thinks Luke has been killed but it is revealed that 14K (portrayed by Robin Shou, who was in ""Death Race"") of the Triad had helped Luke for saving his life.

While Luke's friends think he is dead, we learn that Luke has now taken on the persona of Frankenstein.

Which leads us to the third film ""Death Race 3: Inferno"".

Frankenstein (which is Carl ""Luke"" Lucas"") has now won four races and needs one more to become a free man. As Weyland (portrayed by Ving Rhames) reminds Luke that he will get freedom if he wins his fifth race but to assure that he gets released, he must keep his identity secret and no one will know he is Frankenstein, or else his friends, Lists, Goldberg and Katrina will be killed.

But before the final race, Niles York (portrayed by Dougray Scott) who is trying to make ""Death Race"" international and takes over the popular program.  He tells Luke that he must compete at a desert ""Death Race"" and in the interest of Frankenstein to keep winning, he orders Luke to lose.  Luke tells Niles that he had a deal with Weyland but Niles tells him that the deal is null and void and must do what he says.  He loves, he lives....he wins, he dies.

Luke is then sent to South Africa, as with other Death Race pit crews including Luke's original pit crew featuring Lists, Goldberg and Katrina and also 14K's crew.

As the group is taken to the facility, they see armed guards coming and see the popular Frankenstein arrive.  When rival pit crews start getting into a fight with prison security, Frankenstein's mask has come off and the crew finds out that Luke is alive and are upset that he never told them.

It is revealed that in this Baja-style Death Race, a driver will now team up with a female convict and that Luke must team up with his ex-flame and navigator Katrina, who is very upset that Luke never revealed himself to be alive to her after all this time.

With many deadly racers taking part in this latest Death Race and Luke being one race away from being released from prison, will he win or will he abide by Niles' ultimatum and throw the race?

VIDEO:

""Death Race 3 Inferno"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  Similar to ""Death Race 2, director Roel Reine did a fine job by making this film not look like a lesser version of its original theatrical version by choosing locations in where the film would look much better.  So, indoor shots are in parking garages or rooms but primarily in dark areas in prison.  Low light scenes that really bring out the feeling of desolation but also a battleground for prisoners.  Even better are the outdoor scenes, which show much more detail, especially with skin and also skin tones during closeups.

But ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" is another example of how a film that is direct-to-video doesn't have to like one!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Death Race 3 Inferno"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, English and French DTS Digital Surround 5.1 and English Dolby Digital 2.0.  Also, like last year's film, lossless audio for this third film sounds great.  With the sheer amount of people featured in the prison, you get a good amount of ambiance in the prison. But where this film shines is during the actual ""Death Race"" and there are explosions, gunfire, metal crunching on metal, the surround channels are heavily used during these sequences, especially LFE.  Dialogue is crystal clear and impressive dynamic range.  Like the video, ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" may be a direct-to-video film but it doesn't have to sound like one.  And this film sounds awesome in HD!

Subtitles are in English SDH, Espanol and Francais.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Death Race 3: Inferno - Unrated"" come with the following special features:

  Alternate Opening - (5:21) An alternate opening for ""Death Race 3: Inferno"".
  Deleted Scenes - (11:51) Featuring nine deleted scenes.
  Deleted Shots Montage - (5:01) Deleted scenes music montage.
  The Making of Death Race 3: Inferno - (10:39) Producer Mike Elliott talks about how much bigger this film is and the director Roel Reine and cast talk about their involvement in the film and also incorporating the female fight scenes.
  Racing for Death - (5:54) Filmmaker Roel Reine and the cast discusses how the third film can use different vehicles made for the desert, more destructive weaponry, violent characters behind the wheel and more!  Especially how the vehicles were designed in South Africa for the terrain.
  Art Imitating Life: Goldberg - (5:19) Producer Mike Elliott and crew talk about working with Danny Trejo and how he draws from real-life experience.  Trejo talks about his second chance at life after prison thanks to movies and how he appreciates life much more.
  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Roel Reine

EXTRAS:

""Death Race 3: Inferno - Unrated"" comes with both a Blu-ray and DVD version of the film plus a slipcover and a UltraViolet code that allows you to stream and download the film to tablets, smartphones, computers and TV's.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The ""Death Race"" films are known for its violence, action and always a corrupt prison taking advantage of its prisoners in order to make profit by having them participate in these gladiator games.

Always a battle between the last one standing, the original film from 1975 received heavy criticism for its use of nudity and violence.  And while a cult hit that was a product of its time for trying to shock the audience, it's also one of the earlier films where people got to see Sylvester Stallone in action before he became famous a year later with ""Rocky"".

With the remake released in 2008 and featuring Jason Statham, the tone of the 2008 film would set a goal to be super-violent like its predecessor, make it a satire of reality television and also make the competition to a race instead of a point system.  And most importantly, play upon the importance of certain characters such as Frankenstein and how it generates profit for these prisons who will do anything to keep their ratings high.

When I first watched the 2008 film, to tell you the truth, it probably made more sense to me than other film critics.  I was not a viewer when the original was released, but raised during the time of films such as ""Mad Max"" and ""Running Man"" but also video games such as ""Twisted Metal"" and ""Carmageddon"", the whole idea of people battling in weaponized vehicles and the violence that surrounds these characters made sense.

And when the 2011 ""Death Race 2 was released, I watched it with an open mind knowing that it was a direct-to-video sequel and for the most part, I found it to be a popcorn action film that was not going to be anything deep or require too much thought.  If you love straight-up action films, you were probably going to enjoy that film.

Here we are in 2013, with the release of ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" and watching the unrated version, the film tries to top the second film in terms of vehicles and overall damage.  The action was fast-paced and as one expects to see people going at war with vehicles in order to win the race, ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" also tries to do something different by featuring more violence and not just the men but showcasing the women fighting to the death in order to become a navigator.

Where the men in prison are people you can instantly loathe, the women are dressed in sexy outfits and are prepared to kill another.  From flame throwers to slicing people to death, ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" seemed as if it was become more ""Mortal Kombat"" at one point.

But the original film was always known for its gratuitous nudity and violence, ""Death Race 3 Inferno"" continues that theme.

As for the difference between the unrated version and the normal version of the film, there is not a lot of extra footage.  In fact, the unrated version has one minute extra.  But you do get both versions of the ""Death Race 3 Inferno: Unrated"" on Blu-ray.

As for the Blu-ray, picture quality is very good considering this is a direct-to-video sequel.  In fact, nothing about this film looks like a direct-to-videos sequel and it helps that the first half of the film is featured in a prison and in a cell where grime and low lighting can be used to the film's benefit, and then the race itself in South Africa.  The outdoor scenes look very good and you can see the detail, especially with closeups of the characters faces.  Lossless audio is also well-done thanks to the many prisoners featured and adding to the overall ambiance.  And of course, its the action that sounds amazing with the actual race commanding the immersiveness of the soundtrack with great use of the surround channels and LFE.  Special features include deleted scenes, audio commentary but also a few Blu-ray exclusives.

""Death Race 3 Inferno: Unrated"" is a film for those who enjoy popcorn action film, especially a film that features a lot of violence.  One is not going to worry about any sappy or sweet dialogue, this is a action-film that is all about its action, its returning characters of ""Death Race 2 and figuring out if any of these people will survive by the end of the movie.

If you enjoyed the previous two ""Death Race"" films, more than likely, you are going to enjoy ""Death Race 3: Inferno - Unrated""!",1364601600,,12327,4.73968105065666

5370245,2,B009WGYXIS,"So ass it goes in January that the direct-to-DVD movies will also closely resemble the theatrical films. With a new Jason Statham vehicle in cinemas, we get a cheaper video sequel to one of his former hits. The fact that it is substancally  better than the big screen Parker, isn't exactly saying much.

No, Death Race 3: Inferno is pretty much what you expect it to be and nothing more. For some viewers that will be enough, I don't now what else you could be looking for. But what ever it is, I didn't find it.

I quickly found myself burnt out on the repetitive nature of the car chases and vehicle crashes. It is all the same game as we've seen in the previous entries of the franchise. Some have complained that this series doesn't have the wit of the 1975 Death Race 2000, one of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures, but that is fine with me. This is a different kind of beast and action movie.

I actually found much enjoyment in the fast and exciting previous installments. They were also helped out in no small amount by a superior cast of actors who handle the material like the pros that they all. This time about we aren't given much in the way of strong screen presences, leading man Luke Goss is no Statham, a little too dull to make a really good action hero. Danny Trejo gets a few good lines, better than might be expected, but isn't enough of a star to be able to carry the whole show himself.

Director Roel Reine is used often in the making of video sequels. I suspect that is because he is so good at mimicking other's style. Like with it's immediate predecessor, Death Race 3 manages to successfully ape the look and feel of Paul W.S. Anderson, director of the Statham starring Death Race. I am one of the few acknowledged who appreciate the style over substance approach that Anderson brings to his B-grade popcorn movies. I like how Reine is able to step behind the camera and make us believe that a better director has made this movie. I also do admire what he is able to get across with his limited budget.

The South Africa setting is a good one. The setting manages to look more post-apocalyptic than the previous films, it is also nice to look at. Certainly better than a lot of the terribly looking shot in Eastern Europe action movies to be found on Best Buy shelves.

So what is my verdict. Well, it didn't really do it for me, it didn't excite me in any way. Even amongst all the hot bodies, decapitations, dismemberment and the like. However as long as now what you are getting into, and who doesn't, you could do a lot worst than this fast and forgettable genre fare.  However, I feel this series has run it's course, and I don`t care if we crossed the finish line or not.

5370249,3,B009WGYXIS,"I'm not afraid to express my love for the first two Death Race movies.  I'm a big fan of dystopic fiction, and the combination of interesting (if not terribly original) storylines, fanservice featuring actors of both sexes, action-filled race scenes, and likeable protagonists is a real winner.  Plus I love the satirical chyrons and promos for the race that are a part of each film.

So when I heard a third DR film was coming out, I was excited.  So excited that I was totally bummed when the release date got pushed back.  So excited that I re-watched the first two DR movies in anticipation.

I probably shouldn't have done that last part as it really highlighted DR3's continuity problems, the most glaring of which is in one of the first scenes.  I don't watch these films with terribly high expectations regarding plot, but it made for a poor excuse of a subplot.

The biggest disappointment for me was how watered down the race scenes were.  I don't agree with another reviewer here that this was the result of a lower budget.  If the same scenes that appeared in this movie had been spliced together with a more coherent narrative and greater character development, they might have been much more exciting.  Where was the thrill of watching Frank take on an opponent like Machine Gun Joe or Big Bill?

The new setting, lack of death traps and shields, and inconsistent and confusing use of the weapons plates removed essentially all of the strategic aspects of the race featured in the first two films.  It seems like the producers wanted to keep the series ""fresh"" by not returning to the track on the island, but in doing so, they unnecessarily left behind the mechanics that made the previous races exciting and memorable.  Car chase scenes involving an occasional rocket or two?  Yawn.  The violence that is on offer is fairly tame compared to something like the Starz series Spartacus.

IMHO, the fundamental problem with this movie is the race's near complete lack of relevance to the overall plot.  The battle between Frank and the corporation behind the race takes center stage, and that's the kind of plot line where poor characterization and heavy-handed plotting can't be hidden behind action scenes and explosions.  While this has always been the ""true"" battle of Death Race, in the past films we actually cared whether Frank/Ames/Lucas wins or loses the race.  Without that dramatic tension, we end up spending most of the movie watching a race that we have no emotional investment in.

DR3 wasn't totally boring, it just doesn't have the spark that made the previous DR movies more than a generic action flick. It's worth watching if you've watched DR2 and want to see some resolution for those characters, but I don't recommend it to those who didn't enjoy DR2 or who are new to the Death Race series.",1361836800,,2825,4.771604938271605

Let me qualify by saying that the action sequences (i.e. the race itself) is kind of meh in my opinion.  I guess it was for budgetary purposes but the race legs are fairly boring.  Acting also meh.  But all around, it's still a pretty entertaining movie if you've seen the other ones.

The switch to making the races more like Paris Dakar Rally through sand dunes and small towns really doesn't work as well as it did in the first two movies on Terminal Island which made for better and more exciting driving sequences.

5370269,4,B009WGYXIS,"With three movies under its belt, we can safely say Universal has established a franchise with the ""Death Race"" movies. Who knew a big-screen remake of Roger Corman's apocalyptic 1970s B-movie ""Death Race 2000"" would do so well in theaters and merit prequels and sequels? The latest entry in the series is the satisfying ""Death Race 3: Inferno.""

Many might see two direct-to-DVD follow-ups to a movie as a desperate attempt at wringing more money out of the concept before it dries up. I see it as returning to its roots, as the equivalent of B-movies these days are cheaply made projects released directly to the home entertainment market.

Carl Lucas is legendary when it comes to the prison sport known as Death Race. He's been known as Frankenstein ever since his supposed death. Lucas is the greatest driver of the infamous race. When Death Race goes global, he's taken to South Africa to compete in a deadly duel across the Kalahari Desert. He has one win left before he and his crew are to be set free. Unfortunately, the new owner of Death Race wants him to lose on purpose or die. What would Death Race be without its most popular driver Frankenstein?

""Death Race 3: Inferno"" definitely doesn't feel like a B-movie in the scale of its production. Huge explosions and expansive shots of vehicles tricked out with all sorts of artillery give the movie a bigger budget look than it should have. You can tell director Roel Reine takes these movies seriously and pushes his budget and shooting schedule as far as he can when it comes to special effects and multiple camera shots.

Writers Paul W.S. Anderson and Tony Giglio don't skimp on a sensible and engrossing script for ""Death Race 3: Inferno."" They could easily have just had a bunch of cars blowing each other up in South Africa. However, they didn't settle for that. Anderson and Giglio put some thought into the storyline and come up with a plot that includes some suspense and mystery as the viewer tries to figure out how Frankenstein's ultimate plan will pan out and ultimately work.

""Death Race 3: Inferno"" is the perfect movie to watch in high-definition. Thanks to great video and audio transfers, every fiery burst looks and sounds phenomenal. There's plenty of gunfire, revving engines, and thundering explosions to deafen and shake audiences in a home theater.

Bonus material for the Blu-ray release includes an alternate opening, deleted scenes, and commentary with director Roel Reine. There are three featurettes entitled ""The Making of 'Death Race 3: Inferno,'"" ""Racing for Death,"" and ""Art Imitating Life: Goldberg."" A ""Deleted Shots Montage"" is featured as well.

""Death Race 3: Inferno"" rises above much of the straight-to-DVD fodder released these days. A good story mixed with plenty of destruction will please fans of the first two entries. What action film enthusiast wouldn't like to watch cars race through the desert while running into each other and blowing up?",1359936000,,2953,4.905811623246493

5370273,3,B009WGYXIS,"I gave ""Death Race 3: Inferno"" 3 stars because it means ""It's ok"" in Amazon's rating system.  I liked the unrated version enough to keep it, but it's easily the worst of the modern ""Death Race"" movies.  (I haven't watched the rated version yet.) First of all, it seems unnecessary to the story because the second film could have easily led right into the first film.  However, I will admit that the writers came up with a clever twist to the overall story.  (I'm not talking about moving the race to a different location.  I don't want to spoil it, but if you give up on this film early on you'll miss the twist I'm referring to.)

Second, two of the characters' behavior is over the top: specifically, the main bad guy and the woman producing the ""Death Race"" show.  They both do ridiculous things and make ridiculous statements, like when one of the prisoners makes a run for it by fleeing on foot into an area populated with civilians, and the producer orders the prisoner to be taken out by a missile; when someone reminds her that the civilians will be killed along with him, she says something like ""they'll be rewarded in the next life."" Is there no FCC in the future? Or police or government officials that would take action against the killing of innocent bystanders? This is insulting to the viewer; it's as if the producers of this sequel thought they could throw all logic out the window because the audience wouldn't care.  WRONG.  Sadly, the main villain is the type who easily loses his cool, gets into people faces and then screams at them to make his point.  Ooh, scary.  Then there's the cave these two brainiacs use as a control booth to run the show.  Yes, cave.  It looks like an underground lair Dr. Evil might use in an ""Austin Powers"" movie, with monitors and computers surrounded by rock formations.  Really silly.

Third, the word ""Inferno"" in the title cheapens the film by overhyping it.  (Big deal: there were flame throwers and explosions.  That's nothing new.) Fourth, for some inexplicable reason, the producers thought audiences would enjoy seeing Danny Trejo's bare ass.  VERY WRONG!

So what's good about it? The video is very crisp and clean, and the audio is loud and well mixed.  If you've got surround sound, your system will get a good work out.  Most of the actors give decent performances, and there's no shortage of action.  There's not a lot of laughs, but Trejo's character made me chuckle once or twice.  The twist I mentioned above is a nice surprise, especially since this is a prequel to the first movie, and audiences go into prequels expecting the plot to unfold in a certain way.  As far as recommending the film, I'm on the fence.  I had to see it to satisfy my curiosity, but I don't see myself watching it too often.  I'd say rent it first.",1359763200,,2795,4.573440643863179

-------------------------------------------

This movie is just one of your regular/average movies until you see the ending. You must see all the previous Death Race movies to really appreciate and understand everything.

At first I was just going to give this movie a 3 stars as nothing really stood out for me. There are hot girls and that was awesome, but not worth 5 stars. The acting is okay. The action is standard. The direction was good, but everything just seem to average. And for the writing? Wow! That was what really made this movie 5 stars. What they did great do?

Death Race 1 was on Terminal island and is the location of the death races. Now in Death Race 3, they moved the location and it's not on Terminal island anymore, but, instead went global and can be on anywhere around the world. For this movie, Death race is set in South Africa. We know that Frankenstein has won 4 races and once he wins the 5th race - he is set free. In this movie, the owner of Death Race, Weyland, is forced to sell the business to Niles York, a pretty boy billionaire. He is the one that makes Death Race a global event. Niles instantly becomes the bad guy in the movie and makes Luke Gross (Frankenstein), his puppet to lose all his races and never win another race again. If Luke refuse and wins another race, he will be killed after the race.

Now as I said before this movie set up the movie well and it turned out average until the end. For the story ending is where everything really makes sense. They will now flashback and reveal what happened in the background while Luke was racing and what everyone else is doing at the time. So what Luke does in the movie is race for Niles. But, what Niles doesn't know is, Luke is actually working for Weyland still. He has made a deal with him. Weyland has an inside person working for him inside death race, (a nurse). Luke has made a plan to get his whole team out of Death Race and it does work. Luke first made Goldberg (pit crew member/ coach) die, which the nurse confirms the death supposedly. Then, Luke has a plan to kill himself and Katrina Banks, when he drives his car into Niles trapped inside the control center. Niles is trapped because he was handcuffed to a table by another ally of Weyland. When the car hits there's a big explosion and everyone is assumed dead, but there is one survivor, Frank???

Lists, another pit crew member of Luke is safe outside of the explosion. What seems like a bad outcome in the movie was actually a wonderful plan in the making. Now all the Nurse needs to do is confirm Niles and Katrina are dead. But really both Luck and Katrina escape the crash just before the explosion and they get away free with the help of the nurse. And now, Nelies is the one alive and being called Frankenstein. What makes it so believable is that the nurse puts in Niles, a tracking device that says he is Frank. Then, no one can really recognize Nile because his face is burned up so badly. Now Lists comes in and he says it is him, Frank! Niles has an assistant that could had helped him and confirmed his true identity, but she doesn't. The assistant is now in charge because of Niles's death.

After that part, Lists has an option to get away free with the rest of the group, but he doesn't want to leave prison and that's why he is also in Death Race 1. Niles's Assistant moves back Death Races to Terminal Island and hires a new Warden too. This how everything is falling in place for Death Race 1 to start out. Now Niles believes that he is actually Frankenstein! That's why he was probably the one tat died after the race in Death Race 1. That wasn't Luke! lol

Now the story of Death Race 1 can continue on with no holes. By the fantastic writing and really kept everything all together.",1358812800,,3944,4.356462585034014
5370287,4,B009WGYXIS,"""More cons, more cars, more guns. Sky's the limit."" Once again Frankenstein (Goss) is one race win away from freedom. This time though the race has changed. Instead of being inside the prison another man has bought the rights and is taking it global. Fighting in his crew and other deals being made make this a harder race then usual. I have to admit that I do like these movies as cheesy as they are. I loved the first one and enjoyed the second one OK. I may have to re-watch that one though because I was a little confused to start this one. I thought some of the people that were in this died and the plot lines didn't seem to match up. Then the race started and I realized that it didn't really matter, the plots of these movies are just background to the racing and violence. To me that is OK. Much like the other two this is not an award winning movie and acting is iffy at best but it is still very entertaining and well worth checking out if you have seen the others.

Sure there are  Issues  but, It's  MUCH BETTER ( More ENTERTAINING )  then ,  Crap like "" It Comes , At  Night "" !!!
