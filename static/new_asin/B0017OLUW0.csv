8266739,5,B0017OLUW0,"Love this movie! I had the awesome opportunity to attend the premiere of The Key and enjoyed myself tremendously! It's a wonderfully entertaining film that had me jumping, groaning and laughing. It's cheesy yet fun and eerie. It was filmed near my home so had that connection not to mention one of the actors is a dear friend of mine, but aside from that, if you get the chance to watch this film, I think you will enjoy yourself. I am a horror buff and my interests go from absolute terror to the total cheesy experience. Watch this flick and be entertained!",1217635200,2,559,4.490196078431373
