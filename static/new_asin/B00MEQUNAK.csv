6574960,4,B00MEQUNAK,Very good movie - interesting and timely.  A bit depressing to think so many kids are going to college to party and are not truly getting an education.,1412812800,2,151,4.392857142857143
6574961,4,B00MEQUNAK,We bought this movie! Good movie that challenges the norms regarding higher education in America.,1412812800,,97,5.533333333333333
6574962,5,B00MEQUNAK,"This film gives an important overview of the issues that impact higher education currently. Institutions are expanding without proper adult supervision and communities and students are left paying for irresponsible decisions. Questions must be asked and explored and this documentary does an excellent job  reviewing many of the issues. Every community with a college or university should view this film and use it as a tool to review what is going on within their educational community. Critical thinking, that much touted skill, should be used when thinking about higher education and this film can be one tool to use in the process.",1412640000,3,635,5.2254901960784315
6574963,4,B00MEQUNAK,Was a very infomitive movie. Lets you decide for the most part if the system of education is broken or not. Leading to the fact that soon somthing will have to change with the cost becoming closer to not being worth the cost.,1412467200,,225,4.255813953488372

6574965,1,B00MEQUNAK,"As someone who has spent the last 17 years working in higher education, and who is thoroughly disgusted with the system to the point where I am currently exploring other opportunities, I found this film a bit disappointing. The film spent an inordinate amount of time on fluff and fillers meant to make the video more hip and interesting, but, alas, not more informative. In many ways it was a rather superficial presentation that focused very little on causes and almost entirely on effects -- often seeming to not know the difference. The documentary offers no realistic solutions, as it is difficult to talk about realistic solutions when you don't quite have your thumb on the real underlying problems. I wish more people would make documentaries on this very important subject. And if they do, lets hope they spend sufficient time researching the topic -- and know the difference between causes and effects.",1412380800,8,912,4.967320261437909

6574969,3,B00MEQUNAK,"This documentary was enlightening in the number of ways that different parties to the problem of high college costs view the problem differently.  In many ways it was like the blind men describing an elephant when each had only felt a different part of the elephants body.  I think that it is becoming more widely accepted that our system of secondary education will crumble under the weight of its cost, even as new, and somewhat experimental, education models are being developed.  What was not really covered in the film is that there is a wide disparity in intelligence among young people that greatly influences their ability to absorb and use gained knowledge to solve difficult problems.  An education statistically does not significantly affect the intelligence of a student not prepared to think.  Education systems must be designed such that each individual may benefit, but recognize that all will benefit to a different extent.  Economic outcomes, or social equality, cannot be linked to how much is spent for an education.  Our colleges are competitive businesses dependent upon high tuitions paid by parents, students loans, or government and private scholarships instead of serving their main purpose of making new knowledge available to students that are receptive.  Not all students are receptive.",1412035200,8,1314,5.253588516746412
6574970,5,B00MEQUNAK,"My daughter watched half of this movie in her college English class, I found it in amazon prime and let her finished the rest of movie. It was shocking to me about the fact of some colleges turn out the way very differently. we expect the college is provide study environment for student to pursuit their goal for their future, not to go for luxury suite for them just enjoy and having fun.

6574982,4,B00MEQUNAK,Every high school senior graduating from high school should watch this at least once before considering going to college. Young people are often told to go to college to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives. The truth is many students become distracted with other things like partying and living the good life while borrowing money without thinking about their futures. American taxpayers will see many third and fourth tier schools closing in the decade ahead because colleges have also sunk deep into debt to compete with one another on prestige and amenities.,1461628800,,585,4.91919191919192

6574997,4,B00MEQUNAK,"It's a good film, and points out some obvious problems in our system of education. I really hope MOOC's take off, but that being said, I'm a self study/self taught kind of person. Not everyone is, sometimes people need the social pressure and societal consequences to motivate them to get through school, I'm really only motivated to learn about what I feel I need to learn about, and what will make me well rounded as a person. I'm a veteran who recently went back to college after completing my enlistment, and I've enjoyed online and in person classes for different topics, fairly equally. I wouldn't have tried to teach myself calculus, but I'll definitely take any social science class online because the level of intensity tends to be much lower, and the professor's preferences don't need to shine through to figure out a strategy for a solid grade, in person I've found my grades tend to be lower, because I don't particularly value professor's opinions on the topics they'd like me to comprehend, but not punch holes in theories, or cite a lack of information about a topic as being an issue, which is why i lean towards hard sciences that I can experimentally prove over and over again. Online though, I can easily read, comprehend, and write about/take assessments without dealing with some particular ""esteemed"" human's bias shining through and skewing the expected tone or level of acceptance involved in a given topic. This Film definitely illustrates that having employment tied to education causes issues, where employees expect a certain level of latitude and respect, but are put in a position of very mild power over their students and some abuse it, while others do an outstanding job with pacing, extra help when needed, and they have a much better finger on the pulse of their class than others. This film illustrates the issues that students have, especially when it comes to affordability, and shows obvious evidence that we need an overhaul to the higher education system, with public colleges actually being inexpensive for those who choose to attend, without requiring all of their students to have perfect academic records their entire lives. This is how society has to function now, because automation is here, lifespans are longer, and people need to learn to play more complex roles than they did 50 or 100 years ago, and we don't do this by teaching people what to think and holding them to a standard agreed upon by people who attend school from age 5 to age 75, when they have an obvious conflict of interest with their students in lots of cases. its time the ""elite"" universities start giving full credit to anyone who can pass their classes or their tests, regardless of age or previous educational experience, It just makes more sense than trying to accumulate an entire life record and showing it to a board of people that are probably no better at selecting successful people than any other group of people, though they believe they are because someone selected them at some point in their lives, and I think this film goes a long way in the right direction, illustrating holes in the system that don't make any sense in a civilized, connected world full of human beings, rather than perfect little robots.",1444089600,,3245,4.838129496402877
6574998,3,B00MEQUNAK,This movie starts on the right foot. The film pulls a 180 near the end that I didn't see coming. It reminds me of Rocky when he makes an incredible and impossible comeback. I wonder who funded the last 20-30 minutes..... AAUP? Harvard?,1443484800,,235,4.488372093023256

6575005,5,B00MEQUNAK,Great information about the benefit of a collage education depending on what school you select.  The market for colleges has grown so greatly that the value student receive has been watered down.  Almost 2/3 of students do not finish in 4 years.

It does point out some serious issues (e.g., student debt is immune to bankruptcy) but doesn't detail them well enough to make it clear to someone who isn't already aware of them.

The film does provide some support in that many, many other people are having the same issues. Both as students and parents.

It provides different viewpoints about causes and directions, which is helpful, whether one agrees with them or not.

It also points out some alternative routes that might not have been considered, so that alone makes it worth watching.",1422144000,,690,4.973913043478261

The university, a public goodand ostensibly a place where the pursuit of truth and learning is the highest aimis being forced to adopt a business mentality and compete for students, specifically for the federal aid money that comes with them. Meanwhile, universities bleed money and incur debt to keep these students entertained, first and foremost.

6575021,4,B00MEQUNAK,"This well-made documentary is both alarming and tremendously discouraging about the state of tertiary education in the United States. The viewer takes a tour of universities from the unconventional to the ""party schools"", from the free to the Ivy League. What the filmmakers present is an educational 'system' that has long ago ceased to be a 'social equalizer'. They present the real and difficult dilemma facing parents of university-aged children. The exorbitant (and ever-rising) tuition costs at American universities impose an unsustainable burden of debt. But in many cases the film-makers point out that the students who emerge saddled with large student loans have had a sub-par education. There are no easy answers - online courses threaten to entirely disrupt the old lecture model but online learning still falls well short of the results that face-to-face student-professor encounters deliver. It's sober viewing - enough to drive many university students away from American universities, or into long-term debt.",1420329600,4,1025,5.535031847133758
6575022,5,B00MEQUNAK,"A shocking documentary. Wow!  All I can say is that the astronomical cost of going to the university will bankrupt most families. Again, if we are looking a the upper ""cast"" of society in the USA, this is no problem, but for the overall middle class family...well they are at a disadvantage.  This is a brutally honest view of what costs come upon us as parents.  I can compare it because I live in Germany and although Germany sets aside tax money for college, at least students who work hard but come from families who do not have enormous amounts of ""extra funds"" can go to college and study. Germany is based on merit and hard work NOT how much money and status your family has. Having studied in the states as an American, I know the astronomical costs from a B.S. to doctorate.  The documentary clearly outlines our problems in the higher educational system.",1420156800,4,864,4.554838709677419
6575023,2,B00MEQUNAK,"As someone whose college now charges ten times what it did in 1972, this film pulled its punches, I thought.  Hyperbole aside, universities have become dens of grinning thieves charging exorbitant fees for their services.  Publishers wink back at the professors' requiring new editions every year and overprice their books accordingly, what a scam!  Underpaid teacher's assistants carry the teaching burden while eminent tenurees live off their brilliant years of obedient accomplishment.  Sports mania fills the air while duped parents and helpless students get shaken down with each year's baffling cost increases.  How did this happen and where will it end?  Ivory Tower began to raise this question but, in the end, effectively squelched it with tributes to the goddess of learning at such an angle that you couldn't see the tear rolling down her cheek.",1419897600,5,857,5.264705882352941

waste 4 years of your life and rake up $120,000 in debt while having learnt little is anything

The documentary presents a good overview of the recent history of  higher education in north america and the current state of the challenges institutions are facing. You can get all the key point from this film that you would get by reading 5 to 10 books on the subject.  The film is not objective in that the film makers have an agenda and a point of view.

College is NO LONGER the path to the ""American Dream"".  It's the path to the ""American Nightmare"" due to college loans averaging between $50-$100K (or higher) per student.  The average college students are indentured servants to college loans they will likely be paying for at least 10 years.  And the bonus..?  No jobs! Our economy shed more than 8 million jobs since the 2008 economic crisis that won't return.  Add to that fact there are more than 22 million college graduates (and counting) looking for jobs, your college degree is now for all intensive purposes - worthless.  This documentary questions everything we've been told since our kids were in Kindergarten that a college degree is the path to success.  This should be mandatory viewing for very college bound high school student.  Wake up America - Success is no longer defined by college degrees.  It's defined by good old American ingenuity and technical jobs that require certificates.  If you can build something, you'll probably find (and keep) a job.

Post-secondary education, whether stated funded, private,nonprofit, four-year or two-year is at a pivotal point in history that will determine the US position in a global economy. Institution will have to make some critical decisions on how education is provided and at what price. Students and parents are exploring alternative routes to the workforce which challenges the notion that higher ed prepares students for the '""real world.""  The ""Ivory Tower"" is a great resource for parents, students, educational leaders, policy-makers and educational administrators.",1417219200,,682,5.878787878787879

6575039,4,B00MEQUNAK,"Very informative and well produced. I am not sure what point the documentary is trying to make. It attempts to cover pretty much every angle of the US higher education system's pros and cons, however it becomes slightly confusing what the whole point of the documentary is towards the end of the movie. I think it is a great film, and every high school student should see it. On the same note, the message could have been more clear. However, it is nice that the film is not completely biased. Check it out. Worth the hour and a half for sure.",1416873600,,543,4.3861386138613865

The film also fails to address promising innovations - eg. competency certification - instead of the typical four-year liberal arts program, three-year programs (such as during WWII), and the latest efforts to boost MOOC retention and participation.",1416528000,2,768,5.629310344827586

6575053,4,B00MEQUNAK,"As a man who's completed two Master's degrees and a PhD, and also works as a university professor, I found this documentary quite interesting - and quite accurate. We - especially in the US - place far too much emphasis on education for education's sake, or degree-chasing as a cure-all that will ensure a future career. Many myths surrounding this misperception are dispelled (or at least effectively called into question) in this documentary. Definitely worth a viewing for anyone interested in higher education - and I'd even go a bit further and say that parents who are open-minded and willing to question the true value of that investment in time and money will find this worthwhile.",1414108800,27,689,4.948275862068965

6575055,4,B00MEQUNAK,"Ivory Tower is a documentary that questions the cost  and  value of higher education in the United States.

Even though it has been quite a few years since I graduated from a state university, I could still relate to the subject that this documentary details.  I knew exactly what it was like, being the first in my family to get a college education while at the same time wondering how I was going to pay for it.  I had to rely upon a scholarship, Pell grants, student loans and working 35 hours a week to pay for all the expenses that college entails.  Luckily I made it through and managed to pay my loans in a short time, but like the documentary clearly outlines, the costs have skyrocketed since I attended school.

I am normally not a big documentary watcher, but this one was interesting enough to keep me watching all the way through.  It points all a lot of the major issues facing students surrounding the cost of education and the difficulty of paying off those huge loans after.  I don't know if I necessarily agree that skipping an education is necessarily the answer but unfortunately there is no clear cut answer.  What I do know is that for profit universities with Presidents making millions is definitely one of the issues and seems to be a clear disconnect of the purpose of higher education.

A good documentary that gives a widespread view of all the issues and the complications at solving those.  Worth watching, especially if you have kids preparing for that next step in the world.  4 stars.",1413590400,10,1517,4.574074074074074

6575058,5,B00MEQUNAK,"As a higher ed administrative professional, I found this documentary very revealing. It confirmed some of my concerns from working on the field, and highlighted many others I had never considered.

I enjoyed the brief history of the American Higher Education system that was carefully weaved into the documentary. Puts the struggles we face this century in perspective. The statistics highlighting our struggles were also illuminating.

The documentary itself was very well done. Several story lines throughout. The story line about the students at Cooper Union was my favorite. To explain it briefly, Cooper Union has traditionally been a free college. However, because of the institution's large amount of debt, the administration is considering charging tuition. This story line showed the struggles form both perspectives (mostly that of the student but those who watch with a level head and ""unbiased"" view). For me as a viewer, this was also the most emotional of the story lines. Seeing the student protest for something they strongly believe was inspiring.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm an administrative professional in higher ed. I'm not yet sure how this documentary will effect my day to day work, as I already encourage students to seriously consider the costs and expected benefits of their higher education. But it did inspire me take a deeper look of how I can ultimately be an agent of change in this industry.",1413072000,12,1426,5.1645021645021645

I have made the conscious decision to live well below my means since I've graduated to pay off my loans as fast as possible.  We need more education on the cost of....well...education.  People are destroying years of their lives by trapping themselves in financial debt.  Unless you have someone guiding you, it can be easy to not understand the long term impacts of student loan debt when you're 18 and just out of high school.  Every parent, soon to be college student, or current college student should watch this.  Choose community college, state schools, or trade schools.  The return on investment for out-of-state schools or top tier colleges is not there anymore.  Get out of school with as little debt as possible and start working.  Everyone has a degree now so no one cares where you went to school.  WORK EXPERIENCE is the new college degree.  Get as much experience as you can in the field you want to be in and you won't have trouble finding a job.  The degree can't do that for you now.",1512172800,,1076,4.489690721649485

8671819,4,B00MEQUNAK,"Whether or not you agree with liberal or conservative policies, this documentary provides a clear view of the current state of higher education in America. It touched on some really good insights and included some important stats about the nature of college and the various challenges our students face. I think it's important to continue to do your own research on education, however, and not just let this documentary shape your view, because it's not the complete story. However, it is a very well-designed presentation, and you'll get to gain some insights that you may not easily gain just researching on your own.

I think the best takeaway from the documentary is something that investor and entrepreneur Peter Thiel stated in the documentary. He stated: ""Going to college as become a way to avoid thinking about the future."" This could not be more true. In my opinion, the real problem with higher education, at all levels, is that students are using their degree and diploma to gain some sense of self-worth instead of being forced to prove their own worth. The whole idea of ""if I don't to college, I won't have a degree, and I won't get a job, etc."" is the basis of this problem.

What I'm about the say next was inspired by what Tony Stark said to Peter Parker in Spiderman: Homecoming after Peter screwed up on a job he wasn't supposed to get involved in.

Kids are taught to think that they are nothing without college degrees...but the truth is that if they need a college degree to have some sense of self-worth (either personal or professional), they probably shouldn't be trying to get on the first place. With great power comes great responsibility, especially if you're paying $40,000+ a year for that power.",1499990400,,1728,4.7725752508361206
