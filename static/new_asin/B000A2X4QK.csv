2352606,5,B000A2X4QK,I bought this item because my grandkids didn't get a joke on Bones.  The boys are 11 and 5 and absolutely LOVED Mr Ed - even though it's black and white and kids these days think things HAVE to be in color!  Mr Ed still has what it takes to entertain!,1230508800,,251,3.9019607843137254
2352607,4,B000A2X4QK,For nostalgia fans and anyone who appreciates gentle humour. The jokes look back to a more innocent time. Alan Young (Wilber Post) sure knows how to act with a horse. Mr. Ed is still charming after all these years.,1197072000,4,214,4.512820512820513
2352608,5,B000A2X4QK,"I bought this DVD because I loved Mr Ed as a child and I want my children to

have the opportunity to share in the fun as well. Highly recommended!!",1167868800,6,148,3.933333333333333
2352609,1,B000A2X4QK,It was the same as a differently titled DVD so a waste of money since I had the other DVD,1152316800,38,89,3.5
2352610,5,B000A2X4QK,The eight episodes on this DVD also appear on Volume 1 of The Best of Mister Ed. Don't buy this if you already own Volume 1.,1130716800,226,124,3.8076923076923075
2352669,5,B000A2X4QK,"Gave this gift to a 14 year old boy who loves Mr. Ed. He is a country boy, and this Aunt loves the wholesome content.",1397606400,,117,3.72
2352670,5,B000A2X4QK,My husband was telling me about how he loved watching Mr. Ed as a kid (I never saw it). I decided to buy it for his Christmas present. He loved it!  We spent some time watching it. We were laughing out loud. He liked that as part of the menu before each episode there was a brief synopsis of what each episode was about. Great DVD,1389052800,,330,4.0
2352671,5,B000A2X4QK,Arrived quickly and family loved it. They don't make shows like this anymore. Our 8 year old laughed until she cried. Thank you!,1384387200,,128,4.608695652173913
2352672,5,B000A2X4QK,I bought this movie as a gift for my daughter in law as she grow up with the show Mr. Ed. She has enjoyed it along with my grandchildren. It is a timeless movie for all ages.,1382054400,,174,3.72972972972973
2352673,3,B000A2X4QK,"This is a nice collection, but there are many other shows that are funnier. It was good to see how Wilbur and Ed got together!",1370736000,,126,4.08
2352674,4,B000A2X4QK,The key here is that the dvd contains the series first episode when Wilbur meets Ed. This was given as a prize at a Kentucky Derby party and everyone enjoyed watching episode #1. Of course a little bourbon didn't hurt!,1368489600,,218,4.475
2352675,5,B000A2X4QK,"I boought this for my grand-daughter. She loves horses. All I here is laughter while she is watching this classic. To bad they don't do re-runs on the tube. GO ahead and relive your childhood, I do with my grand-daughter. What a silly horse!",1349136000,,241,4.5
2352676,5,B000A2X4QK,"How could anyone not love a 'talking' horse?! For me, its inwardly and heart-fully hilarious! I still don't know how they get Mr. Ed's mouth to move as if he really is 'speaking'. The greatest practical joke of all time ( besides life itself of course ) would be to find out the Mr. Ed really did talk! The way he thinks and acts makes it plausible. The DVD is great because the program is great! Enjoy Mr. Ed and Wilbur on their zany adventures found in this enjoyable DVD. I enjoy Mr. Ed now, more than I did as a kid, when it first aired!",1343692800,,541,4.113207547169812
2352677,5,B000A2X4QK,"Loved it, was brilliant even better than I remembered and could of watched many more..took me back to when comedies made me laugh more than some do now and some American and British humour is stiff and non funny now..American shows from the 50s and 60s and onwards to 90s were really funny with actions and innuendoes rather than when now I watch a comedy with a straight face when instead it should be laughter as it should be..comedy seems to be sexually explicit and filth not like certain ones years ago when to make people laugh it was clever,just take a look at Charlie Chaplin Modern Times it will make you laugh so much,then you will see what I mean..",1326844800,,659,4.454545454545454
2352678,1,B000A2X4QK,"I don't know if this was a flimsy attempt of MGM to stay afloat or not, but this is exactly the same as the first disc (even identical in order) of Best OF Vol. 1. Fortunately, it didn't help them, and Fox took over.",1237420800,,216,3.9318181818181817
8072959,5,B000A2X4QK,"My 4-year old grandson watched the first episode with me. Wilbur and Carol had just gotten married and there was considerable smoochin' going on. My grandson announced, ""Granny, this is not a kid's show!"" I guess times have changed. In the future,  we will skip the first episode. Hopefully we can enjoy a few of the later episodes.",1443744000,,332,4.724137931034483
