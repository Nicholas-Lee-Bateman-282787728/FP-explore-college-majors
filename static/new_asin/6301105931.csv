But both Burt Lancaster and Earl Holliman seemed maybe too much over the top.  But that was then! Now, after a life that has made me a bit less know-it-all snobbish, and tiring of the ""life is crap"" message in too many recent films--- I am totally delighted with this gem. The energy, the verve, the fine script, everybody just right for the parts . . . It's a life-enhancing, life affirming movie and I urge you to watch it. Also, my copy of it is very reasonably priced for a film with such a fine picture and sound.  You just can't go wrong with this one.

322462,5,6301105931,"Broadway plays and musicals are often difficult to adapt. It's a choice, whether to almost duplicate the sets, as in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, The King and I, and The Rainmaker, or to expand the venues as in The Music Man, Funny Girl, Hello Dolly and many more. The Rainmaker was made into a musical, 110 in the Shade, written by the pair who wrote The Fantasticks. It was just okay and not often revived. The Rainmaker has a small cast, takes place in just a couple of days and the setting could be any farm. It's essentially about change. A plain spinster and a snake-oil salesman who's never accomplished anything. How they change is the story.

322485,5,6301105931,"This film has a wonderful cast and though the acting may have been a little closer to over acting I found it a delightful and thoughtful film which dealt with key personal issues such as self esteem, faith separation of reality from fantasy.

Burt Lancaster was terrific as The Rainmaker, Starbuck, a low level but caring con man who really wanted to help but torn by how best to accomplish this. He was searching for his identity as were all but Noah eldest brother and his dad.

Kathryn Hepburn , Lizzie, gave a solid performance which she seemed to go into as the film progressed. She is a little old for this character but this does not interfere with her performance or the film.

I would strongly recommend this film for anyone who is not only a fan of the golden age of Hollywood for this is one of the last good films from that era but also wants to see a good story which addresses real personal issues, has very good acting and just plain makes you feel good!",1434412800,,969,4.372222222222222

322520,5,6301105931,"What is the value of faith and dreams?  Are we happier facing facts?  Does doing so make anything better?  Can a woman be a woman without the trappings of stereotypes.  And, could we all have this father as our own.

It's a very fine movie, with only the miscasting of Katherine Hepburn it's thorn.  Hepburn used, I assume was directed to use, every single Hepburn mannerism in the Hepburn repertoire.  There were a host of fine actresses who would have brought far more to the role than their rubber-stamped idiosyncrasies.  I'm surprised she didn't say, ""My, but aren't the dead steers beautiful in the moonlight.""  And I like Hepburn in most of her films.

From what I've read of the Broadway production, the direction, by Joseph Anthony, elevates the characters from the farcical to the recognizable and human. The L.A. Times reviewed a production of The Rainmaker, saying of this movie, ""By present-day standards, Lizzie's tremulous epiphany that she will be an old maid seems downright archaic. And Starbuck, the dazzlingly glib con man who sweeps Lizzie up into romantic adventure, is overblown. (Note Burt Lancaster's 1956 film performance as a case in point.)""

There is nothing about Lizzie's ""old maid"" epiphany that is archaic.  The term is still used.  The culture continues to fault unmarried women, and unmarried women continue to fault themselves on some level.  There is nothing archaic, sadly, about it.  As to Starbuck, and Burt Lancaster's performance, there is nothing ""overblown"" about it.  Perceiving the performance as such belies the fact that the Starbuck character must be the most convincing, thrilled, dream-making salesman on earth, as well as the fact that Lancaster shows the necessary depth to the character that it deserves.

Wendell Corey is wooden, and remains so.  Script or actor - I'm don't know.  I've never been a fan of Corey. Lloyd Bridges does a fair job, but it is the father, H.C. Curry, played beautifully by Cameron Prud-Homme, (born in Auburn, New York), that is center, heart, home, dreams, and faith.",1409011200,,2051,5.014792899408284

But I think no. We see this movie: in a ranch Southwest of the USA, it doesn't rain many times ago. Lizzie Curry is single woman  played by Katharine Hepburn who isn't physically attractive and passes his life in cooking and caring of the house for his father  and two brothers. A life mostly vegetative and a  raw survival.
But this is the case, for me, the real madman is his brother Noah Curry. This a very realistic man until the extreme he's brutal, because naked truth can be so,  and does from life a desert without any illusion, killing any desire. Noah is good, but he's blind for life, his reality and truth being deadly and sterile.
 Then, appears Starbucks, AKA Tornado Johnson, played by Burt Lancaster, a con man, but not a evil one but mostly a dreamer unable to recognize daily reality, but with the marvelous ability to induce hope in the life of others. One is Lizzie. Many people is capable to do daily work, but few to produce hope.

Directed by Joseph Anthony, the 1956 film tells the story of a ranching family in the drought-stricken American Southwest of the 1930s, and how their lives are changed one night when a travelling con-man comes knocking on their door, offering to bring them rain for one hundred dollars.

Burt Lancaster, in what is certainly a warm-up for his Oscar-winning performance in ELMER GANTRY, is superb as the fast-talking con-man who wants nothing more from life than to produce ""one little miracle,"" and Katharine Hepburn is absolutely brilliant as the ""plain"" spinster daughter of the ranching family who does not trust Lancaster, but is, ultimately, won over by his charms.

Lloyd Bridges and Earl Holliman play Hepburn's brothers, Cameron Prud'homme is the patriarch of the family and Wendell Corey is cast as the town's deputy sheriff who is smitten with Hepburn, but too frightened to do anything about it.

The exterior sets are transparently artificial, and Ms Hepburn played another variation on her patented spinster role (see also The African Queen, The Corn is Green, Rooster Cogburn, Summertime, etc).  Her acting range is better exhibited in ""The Lion in Winter"" or ""Bringing Up Baby.""  Burt Lancaster also played his charlatan/con man role on other occasions (see Elmer Gantry.)

The writing (adapted by the author from his play) was excellent; contrived in plot yes (and remarkably similar to ""The Music Man"" in story), but surprisingly moving, intelligent and even free-thinking for its time--here's a father who encourages his daughter to become a ""fallen woman"". The original play ""The Rainmaker"" was adapted into the lovely musical ""110 in the Shade"" which is currently (June 2007) being revived on Broadway with the fabulous Audra McDonald. The film has comedy of a sort, personal drama, and a scene with Ms Hepburn's Lizzie in which she predicts her old-maid future that brought tears to my eyes. THAT's where her acting shines through.  The ending has an unconventional twist.

322601,5,6301105931,"Bill Starbuck (Burt Lancaster) is a charlatan selling multi-flavored hopes of fulfilled dreams. Take your pick: early-warning tornado devices or cumulous nimbus over drought stricken cattle. It requires more than animated gestures and wild stories to satisfy the matrimonial desires of aging Lizzie Curry (Katherine Hepburn). Their paths cross in the Southwest as THE RAINMAKER promises thunder to the Curry family of hopefuls and hopeless.

At 49 - just six years older than Lancaster, Hepburn appears old enough to be mother to her theatrical siblings - a mistaken assumption expressed by daffy brother Jim (Earl Holliman) when he remarks how wonderful it would be for her to conceive a child so he could have a little brother. Nevertheless, the vigorous passion of this Old Maid desiring change without changing well compliments the undesputed Star - buck. From the moment he enters a scene, Lancaster steals the show with prolific lines of what Hepburn shamelessly labels ""bunk.""

The smile that overcomes me when the film begins is frequently interrupted by tears of joy and thunderous outbursts of laughter. I love it when a DVD investment pays off this well. Put your faith in THE RAINMAKER.

Sometimes he's a little over-ripe, but he definitely leaves an impression.  Hepburn never completely captures her character, although she does have some terrific moments.  Earl Holliman as her rowdy younger brother scores big with this performance, offering some of the films most amusing bits.

More importantly, he can see the con job that Lizzy has played on herself and before he rides out of town he will have redeemed not only the shy spinster but himself.
Katharine Hepburn was well into her period of playing spinsters by the time she made this 1956 film with Burt Lancaster. The idea of Hepburn and Lancaster making a film together is interesting since they had totally different approaches to the acting craft.  Hepburn would have the entire script memorized before shooting began whereas Lancaster preferred to learn his lines the night before. This is one of those films where the Bryn Mawr accent of the leading actress works against the character, but then the whole idea of Hepburn playing a rube--with costumes by Edith Head no less--is a bit of a stretch to start.  Lancaster really sinks his teeth into the role of the charming mountebank Starbuck.  Cameron Prud'Homme, Earl Hollliman and Lloyd Bridges play Lizzy's worried father and brothers, and it is they who really give the film its sense of life out on the farm more than the sets and scenery.
Based on N. Richard Nash's play, the film was directed by Joseph Anthony, who had directed the stage version starring Geraldine Page (presumably an attempt to duplicate the success of Elia Kazan in moving from Broadway to Hollywood).  The story is still produced by community theaters as the musical ""110 in the Shade.""  Hepburn received her seventh Oscar nomination for Best Actress for ""The Rainmaker"" (the winner that year was Ingrid Bergman for ""Anastasia""), but the role of Lizzy Curry is not one of best performances.  Certainly Lizzy is becoming desperate, but Hepburn gives those scenes too much of an edge.  In her earlier films this worked quite well, most notably in ""Alice Adams,"" but in as a mature actress Hepburn was much more successful in underplaying the desperation of her spinster characters, as such did superbly the previous year in ""Summertime.""  This may well be one of those regards in which it is simply difficult to separate the actress from the role.  However, in her strongest scenes she certainly brings dignity to the frightened spinster, and in the end you understand why she would actually pick Wendell Corey over Burt Lancaster.",971481600,15,2594,4.913043478260869

Hot Toasty Rag, November 7, 2017

Katharine Hepburn takes the lead in The Rainmaker, in one of her finest performances. Shes an old maid living in a small town, keeping house for her father and brothers, Lloyd Bridges, Earl Holliman, and Cameron PrudHomme. Shes secretly got a crush on Sheriff Wallace Ford, but he doesnt pay her any attention. The town is going through an unprecedented drought, and Burt Lancaster, a travelling conman, comes to town claiming to be a rainmaker. As he tries to convince the town hes genuine, he also convinces old maid Kate that shes beautiful and desirable.

While Kates and Burts acting really make the movie, the story itself is a classic. It was also adapted to a Broadway musical called 110 in the Shade, by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt. The characters are real and vivid, and even though its obvious it was adapted from a playwritten by N. Richard Nashits still very enjoyable even for modern audiences. Who doesnt wonder with fear and sadness that theyll never find love, and who doesnt want to believe in that last scrap of hope even when it might be fake? I don't actually like the film, but I appreciate how beloved it is by others. I don't really care for Kates character and choices, but it wouldnt be fair for me to write a negative review for personal reasons.

The film is chalk full of famous moments: romantic, funny, and wise. When a man makes a point of ignoring you, he aint ignoring you at all, is one of my favorite lines. And while I won't spoil the ending for you, it is incredibly famous. You might have seen it before in classic film montages. Burt Lancasters iconic final line, which unfortunately I cant quote here because it would spoil things, is my favorite part of the movie.",1510012800,,1765,4.5968253968253965
