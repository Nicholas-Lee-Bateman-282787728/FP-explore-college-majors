7100407,5,B00VNX5S96,"My wife and I were riveted by this film adaptation of the play, which even though I had seen in London 16 years ago, I had forgotten how the story went and how it ended. Typically formulaic stories of today told in movies and books lack the intellectual stimulation and twists in the ending such as provided by An Inspector Calls. It was an excellent production. Acting was very good. The style and even the music was similar to Downton Abbey.",1456012800,5,443,4.481481481481482
7100408,4,B00VNX5S96,As described in a positive review by Alan Bennett in his 2015 Diary in the London Review of Books.,1454544000,,98,4.2105263157894735
7100409,5,B00VNX5S96,"If you loved the original 1954 version with Alistair Sim, you might like this one even more -- I sure did, and the Sim film has always been one of my favorites. The 2015 version not only sticks closer to J.B. Priestley's 1945 play, but the underlying message that we are our brother's keeper comes out even more despite the 1954 version's stunning and moving conclusion.

Pay close attention to the acting, which offsets the otherwise dry aspect of a British parlor drama. David Thewlis is excellent as the mysterious Inspector Goole, who arrives at the home of a prominent (and arrogant) British family and changes their lives forever. The play's setting in early 1912 is highly significant.

This DVD is currently available only in PAL format, but a format playable in the United States will surely arrive at some point. When it does, give it a try.",1451260800,6,851,4.743243243243243
7100410,5,B00VNX5S96,"""An Inspector Calls"" is a true classic of the theatrical 'drawing drama' genre, and a masterpiece of suspense from author J.B. Priestly. First premiered in 1945, it's three acts of turns, twists and surprises- all within a single room, with a handful of people and no weapons, deaths or violence.
This small screen adaptation is admirably faithful to Priestly's script and intent, resisting for the most part the contemporary compulsion to ""realize the author's vision"" by ""freeing the script from the enforced restrictions of the theatre's four walls"".  That restriction in Priestly's capable hands and words make the suspense and tension all the greater, and the twisted tangled ended all the more shocking, when the Inspector calls.",1534550400,,735,5.282051282051282

7100421,3,B00VNX5S96,"Excellently acted and produced but the story is painfully contrived. The story has been hammered into a tiny and predefined shape. Nothing about the story felt real. I kept thinking there'd be an explanation for the coincidences that made everyone at the dinner culpable but there wasn't any rationale.

But what I noticed from reading the reviews on here that there are many other people who don't understand the deeper meaning in this movie just like the two characters in the movie who never get it. If you only take this movie for its entertainment value...yes, you may be disappointed. But please look past the ""plot"" and look for meaning...not just meaning in the movie...but meaning in each of our lives.",1534032000,,470,4.8875

The director and filming. It's just stunning in its intricacy and its insight. The performances are amazing, and it moves quickly, in spite being marketed as a British mystery. In some ways, it is a mystery. But it's so much more. I won't ruin it by saying much more. But W O W. What a darkly beautiful movie that stares deep into the petty cruelty of people and our foibles. The over-arching theme: we're all connected and we all have an impact on one another in ways beautiful and horrific. What a beautiful lesson to be reminded of.",1533859200,2,690,4.564516129032258
7100433,5,B00VNX5S96,"This play is like watching a train hurtling toward a wreck. We know the beautiful piece of machinery will hurtle off the high trestle, carrying all aboard to their doom...yet we cannot stop watching.  The wealthy British family in the piece are a window into the worst of First World Problems - those of us who are affluent enough to have time and leisure to worry about the ephemera of ego, angst and such., forget the sheer struggle to survive of those less monetarily fortunate.  Do we view them, from our lofty heights, as somehow less deserving than we? Of being feckless, foolish, and thus somehow suited for their poverty? Or are we equally to be pitied, for poverty of spirit? An Inspector calls will make you think on these themes.",1533772800,,740,4.641221374045801

7100437,4,B00VNX5S96,Really enjoyed this production. It's a clever story that clearly shows the impact of unnconnected indcidents perpetrated by a small cirlce of people can have on a single life.

I am not kidding when I say it needs to play in the White House, in Times Square, in every city of the world, in every school, every year each class will watch this movie-every year at least once if not twice a year.

7100447,5,B00VNX5S96,"This movie deserves a full 5 star rating because of its unflinching look at human nature. If you have a tender heart & rational mind, be warned, it is gut wrenching. The acting is sublime - especially the young actors, the storyline is compelling & the lighting, set design & editing underscores and ties together the previous into a story that you will not soon forget.",1533513600,,370,4.621212121212121

7100449,5,B00VNX5S96,"A very good dialogue thriller indeed. The message was quite subtle but true. If you are looking for a Sherlock type movie, this is not the one.

7100451,3,B00VNX5S96,"Enjoyed the story and the acting though it became predictable early on. The Inspector's ""sermon"" toward the end was heavy-handed and unnecessary - yes, we all got it - and it changed the character of the movie from an ironic, sad story to a sort of morality play.",1533427200,,263,4.5
7100452,5,B00VNX5S96,This is a film that delivers a powerful story with very modest means.,1533340800,,69,4.384615384615385

7100457,1,B00VNX5S96,"I found it spectacularly boring.
most of it is 6 people in a dining room talking about a girl who committed suicide and slowly revealing how each person had known her.
if you're into that sort of thing, a bunch of peole in one room, reminiscing in fairly un-interesting ways, give this a shot. :-)",1532995200,,297,4.418181818181818

7100461,4,B00VNX5S96,"This was pleasantly unexpected. I really enjoyed it, but my questions are... Who is the inspector? Is he really an inspector at all?

7100462,2,B00VNX5S96,"Two stars for an excellent cast, but the story itself is like someone's bad play written at university.  Contrived and heavy-handed story revolving around a clich bourgeois family.",1532390400,2,180,5.428571428571429
7100463,4,B00VNX5S96,Really enjoyed this from the very beginning.  A delicious number of twists and turns as the Inspector takes us methodically thru his investigation.  I suppose the biggest twist is how you interpret the ending.  Watch and enjoy.,1532390400,,227,5.081081081081081
7100464,5,B00VNX5S96,"Really great movie. I was surprised to see negative reviews but when I read the comments it all became clear. I find it so weird when people judging the opinions or lives in the movie. We can judge bad acting and bad movie making but judging opinions and storyline in the movie means you are a person who is only interested in validating your opinions everywhere. Movies are made to show different stories and belief systems among humans, you might not believe in social justice but there are people who believe in it. So the movie talks about a storyline to contemplate about this belief.

and this story was quite interesting. Acting was also great..",1532390400,,652,4.6695652173913045

7100466,5,B00VNX5S96,"A truly great mystery - with the greatest mystery being the last one.  Not one false steps in this movie - with a premium British cast, great costuming, direction, acting, sound, music, and lighting, and appropriately limited sets, which helps focus on the sad limits of the initial motivating force.  I cant recommend this movie highly enough, and not just because Miranda Richardson is in it.  It is a J.B. Priestly play from the mid-40s - but, timeless.  The carelessness of treating people as objects.  Anyway, truly a wonderful film/movie that leaves one wanting more....",1532304000,,576,5.021052631578947

7100468,1,B00VNX5S96,"Movies are subjective and everyone's tastes are as individual as we ourselves are.  The VAST majority of reviewers enjoyed this film.  I did not.  It was slow to develop and I never did  like any of the characters, hence never gave a damn what became of them.  Weird that a single girl was so intricately involved with every member of the family.  Hmmm - just like the twilight zone.  The sets were great, I admit.

7100472,1,B00VNX5S96,How disappointing. This is surprisingly terrible. The plot is mostly predictable. The pacing is slow. The acting is over-the-top. The script is bizarre. The message seems to be that wealthy people are horrible and deserve to be wiped out in some sort of catastrophic way..... maybe in a big world war or something. Even the period dress is wrong - Sheila's dress and hair are too modern.,1532131200,7,387,4.791044776119403

The story is nonsensical, incredibly contrived and polarized. I had to look up the author to understand why someone would make such a thing.
All aristocrats and capitalists are morally repugnant, got it. This poor thing is what happens when someone is not a writer, but a propagandist. So when I looked up the author I was not surprised to find a propagandist, and a proponent of the welfare state.

7100487,4,B00VNX5S96,"A very nicely handled BBC adaptation of Priestley's 1945 parlor drama. Thewlis tops an excellent cast. The eerie story, wildly implausible, openly metaphorical, and huffily didactic, has always reminded me of Rod Serling. I'll bet he was an admirer. The theme boils down to a simplistic socialist moral -- the callous rich kill the working poor and don't give a damn -- that's as relevant to day as ever, though also as annoying in its simple-mindedness. I can see why some viewers bristle at it. Then again, if you watch it as just a devilishly clever Serling-esque murder mystery with a great twist at the end, it's no more ""socialist"" than -- as other viewers have pointed out -- your average Dickens tale.",1531612800,,709,4.772357723577236

7100494,5,B00VNX5S96,"This movie has been seared on my mind.  It was so well done, and masterfully acted.  Not a single scene seems out of place or unnecessary, and the plot has many layers and opportunities for multiple interpretations. Judging by the reviews I read, some people see it as a morality play, others see it as criticism of the schism between the haves and the have nots.  At least one reader faults it for not showing that the girl in question had exercised poor judgment.  For me, it was not an intellectual experience, but rather an emotional one.  It led me to a confrontation with my own very imperfect soul. The family in this story, though imperfect, did not deliberately set out to be hurtful.  And yet, they were devastatingly so.  How many times, I wondered, have I hurt people without meaning to, or because I was oblivious to the consequences of my actions?  I am at an age when my friends and relatives are dying, and I am attending funerals now the way I used to attend weddings in my 20s, baptisms in my 30s, graduation ceremonies in my 40s and 50s, and a new round of weddings in my 60s.  Those were all rites of passage and they all implied a new future, or a new beginning.  Funerals--particularly if you attend many--are a different story.  Most of the people I once knew have already met The Inspector.  I expect the Inspector will visit me sooner than I want him to, and the movie reminded me to ask myself:  Are you ready?  In the movie, the characters feel momentarily pleased to have avoided judgment, although the Inspector had not come to punish them at all.  But even if they, and all of us, are here escaping judgment for a while, the confrontation with the dark corners of our soul will comeinexorably.  I pray that I will be more willing to accept responsibility for my flaws and humbler than this family was. And I pray that the final inspector will be more merciful to me than the characters in this film were towards the young woman they each either bullied, used, humiliated, abandoned, or simply ignored.",1531440000,6,2031,4.523287671232877

Leading up to the story's climax, the tale presents a number of twists and turns, and with a number of genuine surprises along the way.  All the production values are first rate - costumes, lighting, settings - and all the actors come out nicely credible.  (Possible spoiler coming here) However, the film's one big drawback was the overly didactic ending scene in which we all get counseled on the value of living better lives.  The moral presented is already obvious and is clearly based on the facts of the storyline, but the presentation itself is so blatant and overbearing as to seriously subtract from the beauty of everything that led up to the ending. That was the biggest and least pleasant surprise of the whole film.  In view of the many strong elements in the story's telling and development, I feel that the last 10 minutes of the movie did not erase all the rest of the film's fine entertainment.",1531180800,,1008,4.7102272727272725

True, the family kept making life difficult for her, but there were a couple of moments there when she made some bad decisions. Having money from one brother, why did she spend a holiday at the beach? Why not travel back to her home town and farm there? At least people would know her. Why stay in London where apparently she has no friends? Then, why lie at the women's charity place? That one lie made everything else she said suspect. But the coincidence of everyone in the family knowing her... I think the filmmakers could have made that more plausible instead of trusting in coincidences. It's a good story and probably a timeless meditative piece on human cruelty but since the suicidal girl is played as a victim thrust about by fate, and since the viewer knows so little about her except for her victimization, she is merely an object of pity or cruelty and not really a real person.",1531008000,,1001,4.597765363128492

There has been a suicide of a young woman and the Inspector would like to question the family.

However, there is a twist at the end so keep watching.

For one, this is a morality play.  Absolutely no different than Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" (that everyone loves).

Two, this movie (actually a play) is unlike any other of the thousand of movies I've seen.

Most movies are derivatives of other movies.  Did you ever notice that when you're watching a movie, if feels like you've seen it a hundred times before?  Not this one.

I watched this movie without knowing absolutely anything about it.  I never heard of the movie, didn't know the plot, didn't know who was in the film, never read any reviews, didn't watch the play.

I was totally mesmerized each and every moment during this play -- not a wasted moment.

7100543,1,B00VNX5S96,"In its defense:
The acting is good, and the screenplay shows moments of sympathy towards the characters that it criticizes; allowing them (without too much of a spoiler) a small degree of latitude to break the fourth wall in their own defense, and protest against the absurdity of the narrative being imposed upon them. The play draws a fair (but unconstructive) distinction between law and justice.

These are all points in its favor, for the most part.
But none of that is sufficient to redeem the message: a bratty, self-righteous, lecturing accusation of privilege -- that anyone who isn't destitute is secretly callous and guilty of murder. It suggests that 'justice' is to find fault everywhere, without degree or distinction -- and it celebrates this inquisition as it is served out, inescapably, at the hands of the Inspector.

The Inspector is an embodiment of Karma; a character of semi-mystical powers, who uses his uncanny insight to expose the other characters -- publicly revealing their hidden guilt; torturing them for the entertainment of the audience. And that really is the point. The script is quite deliberate in explaining that the Inspector is neither interested in the application of law, nor limited by any form of due process: it's all about indulging in resentment.
The script relentlessly paints the Inspector as perfect and saintly and above criticism, and it never makes any attempt to clarify the distinction between his role as Karma, and his character identity as an agent of the state. Indeed, it revels in the ambiguity, cheering on the Inspector as he exploits the mandate of his identity to invade the characters' privacy. Of course, when the Inspector's abuse of state power is met with his subject's attempt to abuse the same power in self-defense, the script is perversely quick to find an objection to THAT.
So while the script is at one level an indulgent exercise in spite and class resentment, it is also, at another level, a simpering endorsement of authority, and a complete abdication of personal responsibility in any sense that actually matters. 'It's important for people to be held responsible', the script intones, but it never acknowledges that 'holding people responsible' as a moral prerogative itself implies any sort of obligation.

In an odd quirk of fate, I saw this back to back with the recent Bruce Willis pulp movie ""Death Wish"", and found amusing parallels. Both are essentially revenge stories that delight in the suffering of the villains, and neither makes any real attempt to articulate the counterargument against indulging in this mindset. But ""Death Wish"" at least has the grace to blush and acknowledge that such objections exist. By comparison to those standards, ""An Inspector Calls"" is morally shallow and unsophisticated. Lofty standards indeed.

I think this may be the first time I've criticized a show on the grounds of its political message. I'm not ordinarily in the habit of wearing such things on my sleeve. But this isn't just a film with a slant; it's noxious.",1530316800,8,3045,5.047713717693837

7100609,4,B00VNX5S96,"In a 1912 fictional English industrial town, a well-to-do middle-aged factory owner is over-the-moon.  He excitedly anticipates his own potential knighthood and the merger of his future son-in-laws family business with his own. The maid unexpectedly announces the arrival of an Inspector Goole (curious that). Hes deadly serious, as he announces the suicide of a young woman.  And one-by-one he interrogates all members of the Birling family and the fianc, Gerald Croft, as he eerily links each with the cause of her undoing.  He speaks as if enduring the most bitter of bites. This is a clever drama, revived and reincarnated many times, since its premiere in Moscow in 1945, as a 3-act play by author J.B.Priestly. The location for its dramatic debut is not accidental, in light of the playwrights political inclination. The piece is loaded with intrigue, a hefty dose of wonderfully British melodrama, a few surprising twists and turns, and some predictable ones. Its suggestive of a latter-day morality play, with a stern reprimand for those privileged, who neglect or dishonor those in genuine need.  This 2015 version of Priestleys memorialized play is impressively adapted, directed, and acted. The mysterious Inspector Goole provides the most baffling whodunit of all, and his identity has been the subject of endless speculation for decades.

Bad guys that are just richy-rich snobs. Pretty much no redeemable qualities. They are typecast as an entire social structure. A representation of every wealthy person, according to the director.
The victim is a perfect example of everything goes wrong. She only tried hard and yet lost everything to everyone. In no situation caught any breaks, and it was never in any case even remotely actually her fault, etc etc. Since they are so completely lop sided,  it's not only easy to debunk, but easy to see through.

Only the shallow thinking won't notice that. Or the confirmation-biased, of course.

7100647,5,B00VNX5S96,"Wonderfully written, directed, and acted!  A great twist on the typical murder mystery and well worth watching.  The reviewers who can object to the ultimate message of the story are showing themselves to be morally barren.  Beware possible spoilers:

The play/movie's idea isn't to unilaterally condemn the wealthy, but to show that each person's actions impact others.  We live in a world where power and social class are closely aligned with wealth and when a person is in a position of *power* they have a greater impact upon the fates of others.  That's not the same as condemning the wealthy for having money, which is something certain political groups refuse to acknowledge as a means of avoiding an honest debate about social equality.  JB Priestley was condemning those in a position of power for not using their influence to lift others up, or at least refrain from pushing them farther down to maintain their own status.  The movie makes it clear that Thewlis is intended as a righteous god, more interested in exposing each character to the others and to themselves than any kind of worldly justice.  Many of the characters, particularly the son who is the only one who would stand trial according to the father, could lie to the real inspector without getting caught.  But thanks to Thewlis they will all have to face themselves.  Even as an atheist, I didn't mind the god aspect of justice in the movie; it was a good literary device.  After all, where better to place a god than in a work of fiction.  Five stars!

No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were:
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.

It's even more effective and bamboozling than Bible stories or Steinbeck. The story treats as equal the following actions: bona fide bad things like raping someone, falsely accusing someone of having an attitude to get them fired, and having a biases against classes and women premarital sex and conflates these with actions that are not obviously immoral like not giving all your employees a raise and not giving charity to someone. The move claims that because there is a difference between well-off people and poor people, that is sad and the well-off should be lowered and the poor should raised via communism. It also leaves out the historical fact that *to the extent* people are without individual property rights and equality before the law (i.e. capitalism), everyone is equal--equally dirt poor--every time and every where individual property rights and equality before the law are trampled.",1528675200,2,1026,5.262195121951219

7100713,4,B00VNX5S96,"An Inspector Calls began as a morality play and has been well received several times. It is now a film, and without much fanfare I discovered it on Amazon Prime.

We find the world of 1912 and meet the Birling family, who are celebrating their daughters engagement. After dinner,an unexpected caller, Inspector Goole, played by David Thewlis. Remember him from the most recent Fargo series on television, he is as good in this film. Inspector Goole has come to ask the family questions about a young womans suicide. Each member discovers their part in this event, and it is something to behold.

Ken Stott, plays the insufferable Mr Birling and Miranda Richardson, is his smug insufferable wife. Their daughter, her fianc, and the unhappy son of the family, all come to play a part. The Inspector is unnerving, and is able to question them all with unstinting honesty. This is a wonderful film to see in these amoral times. A tale of morality and how we treat each other is the message,and it was well done and well received.

7100735,5,B00VNX5S96,"Absolutely a 5-star movie.
 I read some of the other reviews and I see that some people felt this drama was great too. Others found it boring or did not like to be given a morality lesson. Personally I was riveted to my chromebook every minute - that is after the opening scenes where the fat, cigar-smoking Limey capitalist and his proper, well-to-do family indulged in being fat, liquer-drinking, proper English capitalist blood-sucking oppressors of the disenfranchised - as the inspector insolently brought the upper-class ivory-tower dwelling, selfish, self-righteous, smug individuals down to the earth that most of us millions of poor people live in.
He stuck to the point, which was to get each member of this family to face their culpability in the death of a young woman, not letting them distract him from the inquiry with their airs of privilege and superiority .
Each member of the cast - all of them unknown to me - was perfect for the character he-and-she played and each one was brought down to harsh reality when confronted by his/her part in the tragedy.
The ending, though, well it was mysterious all right. I read that some critics thought the inspector himself was a ghost. A ghost? That didn't help clear up the mystery for me.
It was pretty clearly black-and-white, right-vs-wrong to me until the inspector left them.
Then it got murky and the fat, cigar-chomping, capitalist oppressor thought maybe they were off the hook - so? He was in danger of losing the life-altering lesson that they all had just learned - had jammed down their throats by the inspector - that with privilege comes responsibility. But the young man of the family and the daughter too,  remained shocked by the horror of their crimes and maybe could grow to be decent human beings despite being members of British upper-class.
And then the ominous dramatic phone call that brought them all clashing down again: the young woman went through with what the inspector had said - I don't want to give the story away too much so
I won't.
Easy to criticize rich, irresponsible, greedy people for being so callous and indifferent to the sufferings they visit on unimpowered people because of their short-sighted, self-righteous attitude, but in the end
I could relate to them all too, mostly the son who was seemingly the most guilty and certainly the most shocked by the harm they had caused.
And in my own small way, on a lesser scale, being poor and unempowered, I am ashamed to think that I have done the same kind of harm.
As the inspector says we are all part of this humanity and we all must have empathy for each other and take care not to do harm to each other - or else God help us.",1527897600,2,2680,4.6758474576271185

Each member of the family, and Gerald Croft, are challenged by the Inspector to face their role in the suicide of a young woman; to acknowledge the wrong they did, and are given given the opportunity to change. Secure in the belief that their way of life will continue as it has for centuries, they maintain their morally bankrupt view of a world which is about to change forever.

The idiotic pro-feminist nut-baggery actual fits the idiocy of the times and the setting and, thus, would be tolerable if it were not for the heavily biased narrator putting a morale perspective on all the characters and their reactions.  Everything in life is difficult and terrible and unfair for the ""poor women,"" and everything is ultimately the fault of the ""white guy""  (or those working/married to a white guy).  And every character ultimately admits/accepts guilt for their evil capitalist white-guy ways that ruins poor wholesome, innocent, hard-working, oppressed white women.  What a joke.  So sad that another piece of entertainment (movies/tv shows/games) with great potential is completely and utterly ruined by the modern-day propaganda machine inserting their displaced narratives into every setting and character.

We need to stop tolerating these ridiculous propaganda pieces wrapped in the trappings of entertainment.  There are plenty of great stories/dramas with unbiased writers/narrators.  This is not one.  It is a propaganda piece from beginning to end.  Every plot point/hook/development is hinged to a present-day feminist/communist ideal.",1527292800,17,1683,5.7028112449799195

The reality of the characters speaks to the heart, even over the ""preaching"" that becomes explicit towards the end.

Who would not finally support the Golden Rule, after all, since it ultimately means that you yourself will be fairly treated? This movie looks a little beyond that to the special category of those who are truly in extreme situations. It opens the heart to a greater sympathy.

Addendum: I just saw it a second time. It is even better than I had thought, if that is possible. So six stars is what I give it now.

It is based on a play written in 1945, during a period of time when all sorts of people began questioning and eventually rebelling, first against hypocrisy and eventually against the still-prevailing Victorian values which, as it has turned out, used to bind us together with a common understanding of the kind of people we should all strive, or at least pretend, to be (e.g., hard-working, honest, modest, chaste, kind, charitable). Able to move through a time slip, the Inspector calls on a well-to-do family of seemingly good people and leads each of them to the discovery that selfishness (its-all-about-me-ism, sometimes justified as capitalism) can harm other people in ways that were never intended and are regretted (at least if the harm done is exposed).  According to Wikipedia, some critics think the Inspector is a ghost, like one of the ghosts in Dickens A Christmas Carol.  I think hes supposed to be a version of God (or Christ).  I don't usually like films with an obvious message (whatever the message might be), but this film tells the story so well that I didn't mind being subjected to the sermon.

7100888,5,B00VNX5S96,"Brilliantly plotted: starts as a drama of Edwardian manners (manors?), but quickly becomes class conscious, then macabre, then truly other-worldly.  An impossible tale, told with eloquence and wit.  Cast are superb.  Recommend this gem.",1526515200,2,236,5.882352941176471
7100889,5,B00VNX5S96,"Well written, well acted, intriguing story, kept me interested the entire time, well paced, tough issues. I don't recommend people watching this until at least age 13-14. (briefly shows/implies non-consensual sex twice.)

7100895,4,B00VNX5S96,I guess Im stupid but I just didn't get the ending.  I thought it was quite well acted although very implausible.  I did enjoy yet another attack on the social elite  even though I chose to believe that this girl fell through the cracks and that hopefully most are saved and helped.  I am NOT a socialist but I do believe that we are responsible for each other.,1526428800,3,361,4.264705882352941

7100898,2,B00VNX5S96,This is a very improbable story. The inspector shows up and wheedles a story out of each family member that lead up to why a young woman committed suicide. He reveals thoughts and emotions that the young woman had that he couldn't possibly have had access to. Really terrible morality tale.,1526342400,9,290,4.705882352941177

Cause and effect is what was in play! I loved the movie! We reap, what we sow!",1526342400,,373,4.054054054054054

7100902,5,B00VNX5S96,"This was an interesting presentation, quite different from most Ive seen from BBC.  Id hesitate to call it a Mystery as there is no who done it.  A drama about Police Inspector questioning a family about a suicide.  They mystery here is who, or better, what, was the Inspector?

I have to disagree with the cries of socialism.  There was nothing socialist about the show.  The moral is as old as time.  In Judeo-Christian terms, what so ever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me.  Or the Eastern philosophies, Karmas a bitch only if you are.  Not religious?  How about something in cold scientific terms, something Newtonian every one of your actions causes an equal and opposite reaction.  How about Albus Dumbledore If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.  If nothing else, listen to Grandma, What goes around, comes around.

I do have one complaint thought.  I don't like that Prime puts some BBC TV shows, like this one, in my Movies section instead of TV Shows.",1526342400,4,1049,4.51063829787234
7100903,5,B00VNX5S96,A morality play for any time. The inspector is the conscience for very selfish people. It examines how selfishness can cause a tragedy. It makes me think how my actions may effect others. I know how the behaviors of others have effected me in my life. We are all connected in this world. For every action there is a reaction. A good film for discussion.,1526342400,,353,4.446153846153846
7100904,2,B00VNX5S96,I didn't enjoy this movie at all.  It wasn't much of a mystery thriller to me and I was disappointed that they played the blame game throughout instead of taking responsibilty for one's actions.,1526256000,7,194,4.705882352941177
7100905,5,B00VNX5S96,"It was an amazing plot up to the very end.  Love it.  And yes, it is so very true that each thing we do impacts another....maybe we should think about that a little.  A helping hand every once in awhile helps.  The acting was very good and so was the 1912 house, cars, clothing....loved it.",1526256000,3,290,4.218181818181818

7100913,5,B00VNX5S96,"what a fantastic movie, brings the truth of our real selves, out in the open for all to see, it remains on us, to be real caring people, daily.  Our lives are a reflection of who we are inside, of our frail shell, but, our inter-self, is made real to others by our actions, attitudes, and the way we behave on a daily basic.  We are made to reflect God's caring everyday that we live and breath.  HE, sees our sinful natures, although we try really hard to cover ourselves, with a rightness, that is cruel, hateful, and divisive, at its best.  Only with HIS spirit living in our souls, can we carry for others, in the proper way, that HE has called us to do.  This movie, brings that all front and center, for each of us to reflect and look into the mirrors of our souls, what do we see, are we kind, caring, loving, and forgiving, if not, we are like the wealthy family, in the movie!  disgusting, dishonorable, frauds, and liars.  WHAT DO YOU SEE!",1525996800,2,949,4.268156424581005
7100914,3,B00VNX5S96,"The concept of this was more interesting than not. However the overwhelming socialism and social justice speeches gave this a heavy handed feel. Yes we are all connected to each other, yes out actions and words have reactions that reverberate through-out those around us. However no, we should not all be taking care of each other endlessly, without self sufficiency we will all parish into nothing. While over all the idea of five people individually causing their own harm to a single person without knowledge of her or her of them is a bit more of a stretch. The feeling I think I was suppose to be left with and what I got out of it might not be the same thing. While all the actors did a very nice and appealing job in their roles, the rather overt in your face ""money bad. rich bad. rich should use all their money to solve all the problems of the world"" was annoying. It was worth a watch though I'm not sure it deserves a recommendation to others unless I know they would appreciate the socialist views of the world in such things.",1525996800,11,1039,4.416666666666667

7100917,5,B00VNX5S96,I just finished watching this video and all I can say is WOW. After all the clap trap that is pumped out with shallow plots and even shallower acting this movie speaks to core values about what it means to be part of the human race. None of us are isolated and our actions can have unforeseen and dire consequences. It really has relevance in this day age with instant social media where people Tweet before they think. Or don't care what they put out there because of the anonymity of social media.,1525996800,2,499,4.376344086021505

7100921,5,B00VNX5S96,"Oh my gosh! What a brilliant film.  I hadn't heard a thing about this movie, so I didn't really know what to expect.  I love all of the British mystery shows like Poirot, Marple and the lot, so Amazon recommended this one and I thought I'd give it a go.  Glad I did!  The plot steadily builds with one twist after another.  The character development is wonderfully rich and the plot is complex, but not confusing.  It is the subtle nuances that make this film, and they are done so incredibly well by a talented cast.  Each character has been perfectly cast, and the actors all give fantastic performances.  Honestly, I was just planning on watching a few minutes of this before I went to sleep, but ended up staying up late because I just couldn't bear to break away.  I think it's also a movie with a message.  One that is very timely and fitting for today's world.  Excellent movie!",1525910400,112,885,4.434782608695652
