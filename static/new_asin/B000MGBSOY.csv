2734676,5,B000MGBSOY,"I purchased this a while ago and just recently rewatched each movie. Personally I feel that Eurotrip is the better of the two movies, but both are great in their own rights.  Both movies have really stupid, mindless humor that appeals to many people, but it is a whole lot of fun and very laugh out loud entertaining all the same. Id say its definitely geared more for older teens/young adults, though I do know many adults who enjoy the type of humor found in each of these movies. In any case, this is a good price to get 2 for 1 movies. However if you're a person who enjoys watching special features I would buy each movie seperately.",1246233600,,638,4.361344537815126
2734677,1,B000MGBSOY,"Company said they would send a new one, but I haven't seen it yet. All you can expect of a used DVD is that it plays. this one didn't make it two minutes. Not good quality control IMO.",1232409600,,184,3.8684210526315788
