3934601,5,B002HRF68A,"I personally like BSG: The Plan as it provides a new perspective on what was going through the Cylon's minds when they attacked The Colonies. Do not expect this movie to give you every last detail as to how they planned to surprise attack the colonies and destroy each and every battlestar in the fleet, but do expect it to at the very least give you new ideas about how Cylons think and why they did what they did in the main series.",1256515200,3,434,4.240963855421687
3934602,2,B002HRF68A,"I love, and mean love, Battlestar Galactica. It hurts me to say it, but this strikes me as the lowest point of the whole re-imagined series. It looks like they had a bunch of good ideas and tried to do all of them, failing to execute any of them well.

I will say, if you're a fan of any of the Cylon Characters who never saw much development, you can definitely see it here. If you're a Sam Anders fan there's some fan service here as well, but otherwise it's just blah. There's an interesting retroconned side character who is married to a Cylon and spends a brief chunk of time with the Chief, but it's so brief it can't carry the whole two hours.

There's even times I have issue with the special effects, which is the first time I can say that.

And as far as it answering the big questions, like who put the ""12 cylon models"" in Adama's cabin, it doesn't even really do that.",1256515200,15,881,4.201183431952662
3934603,1,B002HRF68A,"I love BSG, mostly the first 2 seasons and the beginning of the third one. I think the last 10 episodes of season 4 were not exactly the best ever (some were very good like the rebellion ones) but I was more or less happy at the end in spite of all the problems.
I was looking forward for ""The Plan"", hoping it will give us some new perspectives and answers. It did not. In fact, it even ruined a lot of good things from the first seasons. I don't want to spoil anything but basically, ""The Plan"" does not tell us anything about the Cylon plan (there was none apparently) and is just a nonsensical, bad-written story about the cylons in the fleet and the Caprica resistance during the first 2 seasons. It is even in some places contradictory with what was established. But mostly, we do not learn anything new from it.
Don't buy it and don't watch it if you like BSG.",1256515200,10,867,4.260606060606061
3934604,1,B002HRF68A,"This was the most awful Battlestar Galactica content I've ever seen. Showing lots of skin does not make anything good, especially when it's blended with the incredibly didactic and lethargic Cavil (blargh-- there were multiple scenes involving Cavil with the cylon ladies that made my skin crawl). There are no new clips of Starbuck-- her scar continues to go unexplained. I certainly enjoyed the webisodes featuring Gaeta a lot more (and that's not saying much). This is told in a comic book shooting style where no scene (except those with Cavil) is permitted to play out. Don't expect this to reveal any big secrets, show a particularly new Cylon view, depict more than 2 minutes of any of the colonies before the attack. In fact, don't expect anything at all and don't waste your money.",1256428800,15,790,4.859259259259259
3934605,1,B002HRF68A,"Battlestar Galactica 2003 was an overwhelming experience for me.  This show expanded the possibilities of television, and combined stirring science fiction concepts with characters, human relationships, and plot situations which enveloped the viewer in a world that made powerful claims on the mind and heart.

The show ended in a way that was costly to the characters and the viewer.  The makers of the show earned their way to the ending with a long plan of unfolding the plot over years.

That's why it's painful, with this film, to be dragged back into a story of genocide, betrayal, fear, and loss.  Battlestar was the greatest, because it always earned the right to tug at your heart strings.  It's impossible to re-ignite those feelings and that experience by reviewing the plot in a two-hour movie.

What this film adds to the perspective on the events of Battlestar is not worth the cheapening of the story.  Yes, it is interesting to have some questions answered.  However, I would consider this film more of a DVD-extra than a work worthy to be considered in its own right.",1256342400,18,1084,4.8478260869565215
3934606,5,B002HRF68A,"This is a geat addition to the series, revealing in some points, not for someone who haven't watched the full series.
Althoug I have already watched it.. I will get the blueray just to take a look at the great attack sequences and extra material!

3934607,1,B002HRF68A,"Boring to the point of death, adds nothing relevant to the previous story, what a disappointment !",1255996800,12,98,4.823529411764706
3934608,5,B002HRF68A,"Wow!  I was totally not expecting this from the BSG writers.  This gives an inside look at the Cylon's and their mind set. I wish there would have been a little more info about Starbuck, Baltar, and his Six.  Love that they didn't keep this restricted to PG, also.  This is a must buy for BSG fans!!!",1255996800,5,300,4.2105263157894735
3934609,5,B002HRF68A,"I am a big fan of Battlestar Galactica. I think its one of the best written Sci Fi pieces to come along in a long time. I will openly admit that I was disappointed with the final season and I am not to keen on how it ended. Even as disappointing as season 5 was, it was still head and shoulders above your average sci fi material, especially material that's made for TV and I have no problem admitting that I was hoping to see more material as I just absolutely love the whole cyborg angle to science fiction. Its just such powerful subject matter as its literally becoming less sci fi and more reality by the day. In fact I just saw a BBC Horizon episode a few weeks back entitled Human 2.0. The subject of the show was the future of artificial intelligence and robots and there were aspects to that show that were literally frightening. In 50-100 years we will have the capability of producing robots that are smarter than us and similar to some of the robots we see in science fiction today and this just makes this whole concept extremely fascinating. This is why I love the whole cyborg premise so much and its also why I just cant seem to get enough of it.

With that being said I really didn't know what to expect from The Plan. I had worries that this might just be an attempt to get as much money from the series as possible before its pretty much forgotten about and that may in fact be one of the the main reasons why this was produced. I honestly don't really care what the reasons are as this is definitely one of the more intriguing alternate angles, seeing things from the Cylon side. I honestly wasn't too worried about the fact that most of the main characters would not be present in this film as again the story and writing are so well done with this series that I was sure it could succeed even without those characters.

Anyways I got around to watching The Plan last night and I absolutely loved it. I won't give anything away, ill simply say that if your a fan of this series then you simply cant miss this, not that you would have anyways. The first 15 minutes, which shows the attack on the colonies in much greater detail than previously shown is awesome. The sick and twisted side of me always wanted to see more of the attack and they have finally given us such footage. Some of the shots are really amazing. Its important to note that they have quite a bit of footage that you have already seen from the series inserted here and there as it gives you a reference time wise to the events taking place. It works extremely well in that regard and it also gives the main characters who have no new scenes, like Starbuck, a presence in this film. So really when you take this into account, there really aren't many characters missing from this film, a lot of them just don't have any new scenes.

Overall the film doesn't hold the suspense and mystery that the series held but that is to be expected as we know the outcome of the series. This film isn't revealing anything new in regards to an ending, its simply filling in the holes in regards to what took place on the Cylon side. In other words its more about information than it is about action or suspense or mystery. The only other negative I can think of is that the film jumps around A LOT. Not only from person to person but also from time to time. Then again they are squeezing everything relevant that took place on the Cylon side into a 2 hour movie. They really are forced to jump around or they would have never been able to make this into a movie. It still has a somewhat negative effect on the film as it just seems all over the place at times.

I was going to give it 4 stars but then I realized that most of the faults I saw in this film were simply a necessity in making this a film instead of its own series. There just wasn't the time to slowly reveal things and again the jumping around was a necessity. So I decided to give it 5 stars as they did a great job given the restrictions they had. Overall it was much better than I expected it to be. With the release of Caprica and now the Plan, the Battlestar Galactica series has really come full circle.

5 Stars!",1255910400,42,4158,4.258227848101265
3934610,5,B002HRF68A,"Galactica just keeps getting better!

We had the Sci Fi Channel series, Caprica, and now The Plan...

Executive producer/writer Jane Espenson and director/star Edward James Olmos have gone back in time, just after Caprica's time frame and told a story of the evolution of the Cylons.  Once they became like us, they wanted to destroy us.  From our perspective, we have Galactica, from their perspective, we have The Plan.  Truly frightening and though provoking, this production opens up topics and discussions that have make their way into the United Nations.

One exceptional touch is the simultaneous events followed onscreen.  As Dean Stockwell, in his dual roles as Brother Caviel in space, and the Priest on planet sees the Plan unveil, each has a different reaction and rationale.  Cylon or not, some of 'them' value humanity.

Like Caprica and the shocking last scene, the Plan is equally enthralling.

Who ever thought that a Glen Larson production would lead to this?  Pa Cartright, Lorne Greene, would be pleased.

The DVD includes a whole variety of features.  There is the uncensored 90 minute production, interactive features (blu-ray), a trivia game, bookmarks, interfviews, cylons on attack,and film maker commentary.

The Plan is outstanding drama, no matter what genre you enjoy.  This is still the best TV on the planet!  ""Say Yes to the Dress"", run away now!",1255737600,14,1378,5.112107623318385

3934623,2,B002HRF68A,"When the BSG reboot was first launched, the Cylons were mysterious, relentless and inscrutable. That sense of the unknown made them an effectively chilling enemy, and was responsible for ratcheting up the tension and paranoia that marked the series and contributed to its greatness.

The problem with The Plan is that it peels away whatever layers of mystery were left, and presents the Cylon attack as the work of a handful of skinjobs who are emotionally indistinguishable from humans. You're left thinking that this could've been the work of disgruntled Colonials instead of sapient and powerful machines. In The Plan, the Cylons literally have group meetings to plan their nefarious schemes, and they argue just like humans -- which is not consistent with the united, vengeful and ruthless Cylons of the first few seasons.

Even when we (the audience) know that 12 Cylon models look like humans and are effective infiltrators, there's still that sense that the surviving humans were dealing with an emotionless machine intelligence utterly without sentiment, a machine singular in its purpose that cannot be bargained with. Kind of like how the Borg were first presented way back when Captain Picard and crew encountered them in Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Think of the terror of early episodes like ""33"" and the fear among the Galactica crew when those massive basestars would appear in an eyeblink, Raiders screaming toward the Galactica behind columns of warheads, crossing hundreds of kilometers of space as warheads detonated to the rhythm of Bear McCreary's epic taiko drums

By humanizing the Cylons so much, by retroactively making it look like there was widespread dissent, by turning them into a squabbling group of malcontents, The Plan just destroys whatever mystery and potency the Cylons still had as the antagonists of BSG. There CAN be too much of a good thing, and some things are best left to the imagination, to let the viewer's mind sketch in the details that aren't shown. If you're a fan of BSG, do yourself a favor and skip this one. The series is better without it.",1470009600,,2098,5.0201149425287355

But the series was concluded in such a rushed manner that a great injustice was done to the pace, space and focus of the show's brilliant writing.

If anything, it confused things rather than clearing them up. I feel like if I gave it some thought I could make sense of it, but I don't feel like it would be worth it. I will consider the last ep of the season 4.5 DVD set, which was amazing, to be the end of the show and I'll pass this movie on to the thrift store.

...OKAY, seriously, no one in their right minds would be reading or watching this as a stand alone movie...

This will make zero sense if you haven't seen the series in order, and paid a great deal of attention. Actually, it's best to watch this after a BSG series re-watch, where you can mentally slot this all into the places where it should go. This is not told in any logical fashion - it is an attempt to fill in the gaps, and is an admiral (no pun intended) attempt, truly, since everything production-wise is well and truly wrapped up by the time they pulled this little feat off. Major kudos for everyone they managed to pull back in for this, for the decent attempt at production values, for the music, for Tricia Helfer, and my gods the brain frakking effort to give the fans a treaty treat. Don't forget to watch the deleted cuts, which add to the story.

I keep wanting to make an Ultimate Series Re-Watch Guide, since BSG is SO GOOD (but SO IMPENETRABLE to the dilettante). In my head, I'd put the pieces of this movie right where they need to go, from the very VERY beginning before the miniseries (or ""Before the Fall"", at the very last episode and OW MY BRAIN), then during the miniseries...then all along the first three seasons, during the webisodes that relate, and ending when the Cavils meet and (SPOILER SPOILER OH WHATEVER WHY ARE YOU READING) die.

In Summary:
The Plan is worthwhile for the rabid BSG fan, but not important if you really haven't been paying attention. It's a Love You note to the fans, and if you love BSG back, then buy it to thank everyone involved. Seriously, the gesture is important, and that's why we also bought Dr. Horrible, even though we could get it free online - to thank Joss Whedon for his Horrible Awesomeness. But The Plan really does fix a lot of dangling plot threads, shows Trica at her most versatile, explains poor Boomer, throws a lot of cute Cavil evuls at us, and gives Anders a lot more to do, with bombs! Our series would be incomplete without The Plan. It's all very 'downstairs' to the 'upstairs', which is fun by itself.",1431820800,2,2107,4.507853403141361

3934702,4,B002HRF68A,The DVD is good quality with accurate colors and clear images. Not sure if it truly answers many questions about the Cylons but it was an enjoyable movie. Basically it is bits and pieces of several episodes that were edited from the TV series probably due to time constraints. I'm guessing if these episodes were unedited they would run about 20 minutes over the one hour TV time slot.  It does a  good job adding details to certain key events as well as supplying interesting background information on some characters. Worth buying if you are a BG fan.

Still, that being said, it's still BSG, and therefore, there's a certain level of entertainment and quality that's guaranteed.  I think it's probably not unfair to say that this is just for the diehard fans, but if you've ever watched the show, you probably became a diehard fan.",1391558400,,468,4.658536585365853

Or maybe it would be better to watch the plan first.  That way you aren't as confused as I was when I watched the series for the first time.
Anyway, The Plan, is made up of cut scenes from the series spliced together with original content.  They made it work, but it kinda seems like a rip-off because there is no new Adama content even though he is in the movie via cut scene.  There's plenty of cylon 1 (Dr. Yueh from Dune / Al from quantum leap) so if you like him then this is golden.",1390435200,,642,4.096

""The Plan"" is the complete opposite of the series I fell in love with; it's terribly acted, directed and scripted, full of exposition, and the visuals are horrid. There's also the fact that it contradicts events that the show presented -- the Sharon segments in ""The Plan"" almost had me ripping my hair out in frustration! I made it about halfway through before I had to shut it off and attempt to cleanse my mind of what I'd just witnessed. It's not just a disrespectful, uninspired awful film for fans of Battlestar Galactica -- it's a terrible film in general. Trust me.

3934735,3,B002HRF68A,"I purchased a bluray combo of The Razor and The Plan at Costco. I'm not sure if there are any differences between that version of The Plan and this one. I have only watched The Plan so far so I will only comment on that movie. I thought this was a nice summary of the series. I had a friend that was a BSG fanatic tell me one time that he was hoping the cylons would win the war and kill the humans. His reasoning seemed to be that we are imperfect and should be shown the error of our ways. So I am surprised that he didn't see the imperfections in the cylons too. The Plan spells it out rather plainly for all to see. In many ways they were just as messed up but lovable as we are.

That said, what did irritate me was the quality of the bluray video. It was terribly grainy in many scenes. Probably around 40% of the movie. It was only $8.99 for the combo. I am left feeling that they didn't care too much about this release and didn't want to invest any time or money in making it the best it could be. If it had been pristine I would have been a lot more impressed with the production company. I don't see any reason for the poor quality. Both movies, The Plan and The Razor, were on separate disks so I doubt they were running out of space on the disk. This version may not have the quality problems.

This movie tries to fill in the blanks of how and why certain things happened during certain points in the series, but it ends up filling in details that just didn't need explaining. We didn't need to know how Boomer got her orders in season 1, or how the number 6 pretending to be Shelley Godfrey got away. It was enough that they did, and the explanations in this movie just ruin those earlier moments.

Personally, I'm sure I'll rewatch the series in its entirety in the future, but I'll definitely skip this movie. It adds nothing to my enjoyment of the earlier series, and doesn't stand on its own as even remotely entertaining.",1373241600,2,811,4.586206896551724

3934742,4,B002HRF68A,"I have read many reviews skewering the tv movie ""Battlestar Galactica:  The Plan"".  I don't share those negative opinions.  I think the biggest obstacle to ""The Plan"" was that it came out a few months after the series ended.  So, fans were still very keyed up about the series and hoping for something revelatory or a continuation of the show.  ""The Plan"" is neither, and that's ok.

  What ""The Plan"" is is companion tale that shows many of the back stories and unknown machinations of the main characters, particularly the Cylons as they prepared for their assault on the 12 colonies.  Since the series was over, and all the secrets had been revealed, the details of some of the more shocking plot twists could come into focus.  Additionally, you get to see the nuclear attack from a vastly different, and more devastating, point of view.

  The actual chronological events of ""The Plan"" conclude late in season 2 (but, to not spoil anything, you still need to have watched the whole series first).  When you break it all down, ""The Plan"" is like one large extended `deleted scene', in that it helps fill in a lot of gaps from those first two seasons.",1371168000,,1153,4.643564356435643

When I first learned they had made a remake of the Original Series I am here to say I was MOST CRITICAL and HAD SHIELDS RAISED AND WEAPONS CHARGED just waiting for the NEW BATTLESTAR GALACTICA TO FAIL, in an EPIC MANOR I MUST ADD...  Much to my surprise, let me emphasize SURPRISE here, the New Battlestar Galactica WAS A SCIFI DREAM COME TRUE.

3934746,3,B002HRF68A,"The Plan is something more than a clip show, but also much less than a movie. I'd say the plan is about 50% previous clips and 50% new material. In short, it seems designed to be filler, to answer some of the gaps in the TV series. However, for the most part I didn't feel those gaps were particularly mysterious or needed answering. Who blew up the water tanks in the episode ""Water""? Well, we always figured it was a Cylon, whether it was Sharon or a Six seemed irrelevant.

The Plan is worth watching for the subplot involving the Simon Cylon on the fleet. The Simon model was one that didn't really get much of a chance to shine on the show. However, in The Plan one of the Simons is married to a human and is forced to struggle with his loyalty to the Plan and his love for his family. Also, it's nice to see the John Cavil model again.

The Plan has some graphic sex and violence scenes, far more so than the TV show. Probably nothing that'll disturb most viewers, but it does stick out a bit (stuff that wouldn't have gotten past most network censors).",1368662400,,1059,4.263681592039801

Their were some unanswered questions but any decent show that is worth a salt never gives away everything, ever. However, I have had a problem with the new battlestar as a whole. The orginal battlestar was a fun action show in space, mostly, for younger viewers. Now thou everyone thinks the only way to make a good show is by making it R rated. As a whole the new battlestar has too much drinking, sex, and otherwise way too heavy adult content. They have made it hard for younger people to watch shows like this anymore. When I was a kid I watched star trek with my dad and I loved it. I would be nervous to let my kids watch battlestar, and, this movie has finaly taken this so far to the R rating that I wouldn't even let a teen watch it. Their is way too much nudity in this movie, and even more so, pointless nudity. I can't stand nudity in prime time. I have kids and they are exposed to crap. I don't like heavy R rated activites. At the start they are in another strip club and the barrtenders are topless, at one point the cylons just walk into a locker room, and for what. Why a locker room why not the chapel. All this R rated crap is destroying tv for me and my kids. I want the laws put back in place. I want the R rated crap shows back on HBO where they belong, and I want to be able to watch tv with my kids in peace, and this show I could never watch with my kids.",1367625600,4,1511,4.023255813953488

Who the FRAK can keep track of all that?  In the end Cavill's motivations boil down to he had huge mommy issues that he never got over.

The Plan was supposed to illuminate the Cylon's main motivations to destroy Humanity.  But when you spread your ""evidence"" out so wide and far, you end up casting LESS light on those motivations and just confusing the whole issue.

The series is one of the biggest, best science fiction series ever to be produced.

The acting was outstanding.  The direction was fantastic, and the story-line was (generally) engaging.

All that said, the Plan was more than a bit of a let-down.

If you are a hard-core BSG fan then you are going to be disappointed by the lack of consistency and lack of follow-through with the Plan.  If you never watched the series, or, if you only watched pieces then you are going to be confused and disappointed.

There really wasn't a plan at all.  The Plan did not explain the ""why"" of the fertility clinics on New Caprica.

The fan base realized that the series evolved as time went on, and the fan base had a significant impact on the plot direction and importance of various characters.  In the pod casts, the production crew explained how some of the critical characters were actually designed originally to be side characters.

Bravo to the writers and producers for using the fan feedback.

But, sometimes less is more.  When Lucas tried to explain the origins of the Force as sub-cellular additions, it ruined the concept for many faithful fans.

The same is true about the Cylons' plan.  The Plan tried to explain something that should either have been revealed to the audience around the beginning of Season Two (if a plan really existed at that point), or it should have remained a mystery.

The reality is that there really was not a plan.  The plot evolved based on an intricate dance between the producers, the writers, and the fan base.  That is Good Thing(tm).  Trying to do a redaction at the end of the series to make the inconsistences appear to be planned is a Bad Thing(tm).

The Plan tried to say that the entire Cylon ""skin job"" world was falling apart from the first episode based on their huge moral qualms.  The ambiguity seems to have been inserted post facto.

The new footage with the old characters had them showing prophetic insights that simply were not there in the series.

Also Cylon John was everywhere in the Plan, and that just did not make any sense.  In the series, Cylon Sharon had seemed genuinely confused about what she was doing leading to interesting ""nature vs nuture"" questions.  In the Plan, she is getting direction from Cylon John.  There was never any real confusion.

For those that watched the whole series, the Plan feels like the discussions that the fan base used to have about Star Trek, the original series, or the original 1980s vintage Star Wars movies.  If the fanboys had been able to do a Star Trek movie, it would have felt like the Plan.

Is it worth watching?

I would have to say 50/50 if you are a hard-core fan, and absolutely not if you were either a casual viewer or non-viewer of the series.

In service,

Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
-----------------------------------------
Man, I wish I'd bought this disc a long time ago... I was a *huge* BSG fan, but I held back on picking up ""The Plan"" for over a year, based largely on misleading Amazon comments that made it seem like this was basically a cheesy clip reel of previously-seen footage that was lazily strung together to form a new narrative based on the Cylons' point of view.

I should have known better.  This feature-length film is mostly comprised of new footage, with some scenes from the original series brilliantly woven in, and the BSG producers were still in their full powers when they made it. (Unlike the wobbly ""Caprica"" series, which also explored the Cylon AI issues, but ultimately fell apart under the weight of low ratings and an unsupportive network...)

Although the original series dealt with many of the spiritual issues confronting, dividing and uniting humans and Cylons, ""The Plan"" offers additional depth and a compelling new narrative arc. Indeed, its ending has a more reserved, less far-flung, far more satisfying feel than the big finale of the main BSG show. More subtle, easier to swallow given the gritty feel of what had gone before.  If you are a Galactica fan on the fence about picking this one up, don't hesitate any longer: it's totally worth it.

Faithful BSG fans knew the ""plan"" already, the Cylons wanted to wipe the human race from existence, there is nothing more to know. So what is the point of this movie? The movie is pointless. Little tidbits of new footage are poorly thrown together with previous footage from the series and snippets of uncut footage from the series. The end result of this monster mash lack character development at its worst with almost no CGI effect so well previously used in the series. Film footage jumps all over the place spastically from one useless seen to the next. Watching this movie fans have to ask, where is Madam President, played by Mary McDonnol or where is Jamie Bamber who played the Admiral's son and last but not least we find only previous cut and uncut footage of Starbuck, played by Katee Sackhoff. Without the other mainframe characters and a good plot and point to this prequel, BattleStar Galactica fails on all levels. My review, squashed potatoes.",1302825600,2,1193,4.852941176470588
3934798,5,B002HRF68A,"Engrossing storytelling! The Plan was everything BSG could have been, should have been and tried to be. While BSG was too slow moving, at times preachy, and only sporadically brilliant (but oh so brilliant on occasion) The Plan moved like quicksilver through a back story that outclassed it source material as thoroughly as the BSG revival of the 2000s eclipsed the 1970s original. Parts of this presentation, like the countdown to the destruction of the colonies, the icy, detached progress reports of the Cylon Hybrid---the forests of Virgon are BURNING, the cities of Caprica are BURNING...the Colonies of Man lie trampled at our feet---gave me cold chills. That's how good it was!",1301875200,,684,5.116071428571429
3934799,5,B002HRF68A,"I think many of the other reviewers were looking for something completely new and different and were disappointed as a result.  Personally, I loved how the ""fleshed out"" the attack of Cylons on the home worlds, and gave more background to some of the main Cylons like Cavil as well as the ""sleeper"" Cylons.  I also loved the music, especially the main theme and was glad when they finally released the music digitally.  If you've watched the whole series, yes the Cylon point of view is not a surprise but it's still interesting seeing things from their view.  The commentary is great and adds a lot.",1301011200,6,600,4.632075471698113

It is a great addition to the series and makes for compelling viewing to present the other side's point-of-view for the entire series. There are obviously spoilers though, so this cannot be regarded as a prequel... Instead, it should be seen after the series is over to act as the aha-type of episode that adds clarity to the inevitable set of questions that come after something as epic as the entire show.",1300665600,,451,4.7215189873417724

With a good movie, time flies, in fact, you hope a good movie would keep on playing, at least for another hour after the closing credits roll. And when it finally does end, you can't wait for the sequel/s.

Battlestar Galactica: The Plan is the opposite of all that. I couldn't wait for it to end - thank God for the trusty fast forward button!

3934802,4,B002HRF68A,"First off, you should only see this DVD after you have already watched seasons 1-4 of the main series, since it will tell you who the 12 Cylon models are.  This DVD is not really a movie, it's more of a series of scenes which fill in various blanks of the first two seasons.  Then we get two new short plotlines, one involving a number Four and one involving two number Ones.  It seems to me the purpose of these is to show that no one in the BSG universe is totally good or totally evil, not even the number Ones, since we get to see a contrast between the ""bad"" One which seems to be the mastermind, and the ""good"" One down on Caprica.

When you discover what ""the Plan"" is, you may very well be justifiably disappointed.  ""What about Hera?  What about New Caprica?""  Well, look at it this way: if they started each episode with ""AND THEY HAD A PLAN, BUT THEIR PLAN GOT SCREWED UP AND NOW THEY'RE JUST WINGING IT"" it would have been more honest, but could you take the show seriously?",1299283200,3,986,4.212765957446808

3934805,3,B002HRF68A,"One would expect that after three seasons of being told the cyclon's have ""A Plan"" that by the end of the series even if said plan went awry you would have a pretty good idea what that plan was.  Well I guess that by changing the prologue script for the beginning of season four the writers and producers forgot to put that on the agenda while they were busy trying to figure ways to tie up all the loose threads.  Hence we get another dip into the Sci fy channels most lucrative franchise.  Actually I was being a bit facetious BSG, while setting the bar incredibly high for what a television series could be, suffered from a form of schizophrenia -- it was a SF show that didn't want to be identified as a SF show, hence the one SF element that couldn't be denied was given very short shrift during the series run, namely an artificial life form that became self aware.

That doesn't mean that ""The Plan"" isn't any good, it's actually pretty good if only for giving some characterization to some players that got practically no development while the show was airing (like Simon).  It's just that this is stuff that really should have been worked into the series while it was still airing. It's stuff that the show needed.  If your a fan, or if your just curious give it a look, there are worse ways to spend your time, but if you choose to skip it, it won't affect you feelings toward the series either way.",1295654400,,1409,4.379310344827586

I assumed it revealed what exactly was the Cylon's plan behind attacking the humans. Possibly there was something more to it than just being revenge on their creators. Turns out that was it. There aren't any revelations in this movie. It's more like a bunch of deleted scenes edited together. You get answers to questions you didn't really have or care too much about. You see scenes you really don't need to see.
This was directed by Edward James Olmos and it's noticeably one of the more confusing and poorly directed in my opinion. For fans of DVD commentary I have bad news, the commentary is horrible for this movie, Olmos and the writer Jane Espenson don't really talk much and what they say isn't very interesting. Olmos basically thanks every single person to have ever worked on the show. This commentary is easily the worst commentary for any Tv show/ movie DVD I have heard.
I personally think spoon feeding insignificant details is just a waste of time. The audience can assume what happened in most cases. I watched this after watching the series finale and this movie just left a bad taste. Highly not recommended.",1292889600,3,1222,4.714953271028038

The twelve colonies flee from genocidal killbots for Earth. A whole lot goes on in that little narrative thematically but there's only so many stories you can tell within it.

And then there's The Plan -- the first two seasons from the ""enemy's"" perspective. Except as it goes along, the line between friend and enemy grows blurry (really one of the main points behind the entire show). But that's what happens when your grand Plan is just a hurt little boy lashing out at his parents. There was never any greater cause at work, just a robot trying to understand love. One of the oldest (and moldiest) cliches in science fiction but here mad fresh and poignant.

There are some nice insights into the Cylon world and a couple of...""that's what was going on during that time"" revelations you'll experience, but it's mostly a frustrating empty piece that doesn't fill in any major gaps.  Maybe if this was extended into a few episodes it would have been more complete and easier to follow.  I got this dirt cheap, so I wasn't mad.

3934814,3,B002HRF68A,"Having never watched the series, the movie confused the bejesus out of me. I felt like I walked into the middle of a film with the characters already introduced. Not as bad as ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie lack of character introduction, but darn close.
I never really grasped why Cylons needed planets and didn't just destroy them. Why were their nuclear weapons so puny? Didn't we make them with an off switch? The movie bounced around a lot and I had to figure out who was real, who were Cylons and why would they care they were once ""enslaved"" robots. The movie has far too much dialogue and not enough action. The colony planets all had names with some kind of zodiac sign associated with it, although I don't know why. If these are all colonies, what happened to earth? If you are going to have gratuitous nudity, what is wrong with Tricia Helfer?

After the earth colony planets are poorly nuked, Cylons for some reason occupy the planet Caprica so humans, inspired by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen (Red Dawn), attack the Cylons, although not often enough to make for some exciting action. The latest generations of Cylons who look human also have some human emotions, although I don't know why, other than the fact it made for some lousy scenes.

What made the whole story unbelievable was that the priest Cylon never molested a young boy who would visit him. Like what planet is he from? There wasn't enough fracking ""action or fracking nudity to carry the fracking film. Oh yes the use the word ""frack"" as a substitution for the f-bomb.

If you were a more casual watcher or haven't already seen the entire BSG series, then this isn't for you.  The Plan's own story arc is much weaker than even most of the regular episodes', and the presentation is awkward -- this one movie spans more than two seasons, so it has to jump over lots of periods of time in order to concentrate on the specific moments that relate to this alternate-viewpoint retelling of the story.  If you're not very familiar with the original plot, you'll have a harder time keeping track of what's going on.

This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.

DVD CONFUSION
-------------------------------------------------------
The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.

In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.

Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009).""

========================================

OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD
-------------------------------------------------------
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from customer Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.
-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.

BOTTOM LINE:
-------------------------------------------------------
As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:
(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.
(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).

NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------
-The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!

3934821,4,B002HRF68A,"It seems each successive incarnation of Battlestar Galactica becomes more adult-themed and less suitable for children.  This is probably for the best, the show matures as the audience matures.  The original BSG circa 1980 was like a comic-book sci-fi story adapted for the big screen; questionable special effects mixed with simple dialogue.  Then came the re-do by the Scifi channel with its overt themes of religious conflict, social justice, family breakups, divorce, etc...  Now we have BSG: The Plan.  This movie clocks in at just under 2 hours, and is a recap of seasons 1 and 2 of SciFi's BSG as told from the point of view of the cylons.  Featuring almost all of the known cylon models, this show emphasizes personal drama more than anything else.  It features nudity, sex, swearing, suicide, murder, and betrayal all up close.  There is almost no humor so the show's tones are quite dark.  The central message of the movie is love, and how the effects of love can screw up the best laid plans.  Specifically, the various cylon sleeper agents embedded in the colonies have fallen in love with humans and hence foil their own plans to wipe out mankind.  All told, a good movie that completes the BSG saga.",1276992000,,1212,4.778846153846154
3934822,1,B002HRF68A,"Sometime toward the end of Season 3, the showrunners of the new BSG had started to lose track of what they were doing; season 4 saw the series painfully collapse under the weight of its own mythology, with the writers unable to come up with a more satisfying conclusion to the story than ""God did it and the characters are angels"". ""The Plan"" is the recycled vomit of that mythology, explaining things that were better left unexplained while failing to explain the things that really needed to be clarified. And, as can be expected from a group of people who had completely lost track of what they were doing, it contradicts previous canon. If the Cyclons' ""Plan"" was little more than ""exterminate humanity"", then why did the phrase ""And they have a plan"" continue to appear during the opening for season 3, during which the Cylons wanted to peacefully coexist with humanity and find Earth? All of this, plus a total lack of emotional depth, make ""The Plan"" a disgrace to the new BSG.",1275264000,3,984,4.660919540229885
3934823,3,B002HRF68A,"It's simple as that.  You'd think, given much of what happened in the series and from Cavil himselves, this would be obvious enough.

But given the immense amount of mystery, intrigue, and emphasis placed on the whole ""AND THEY HAVE A PLAN"" bit, I'd expect it to match what the series was giving us in heaping doses---pseudo-religious, mythical, spiritual, perhaps even psychological motivations for the attack on Humanity.  Perhaps something as grandiose as ""The Cylons did not WANT to attack humanity, but God ordered the Cylons to destroy humanity (as per the mythology of the Flood) and test the survivors to prove their worth""

Nope.  ""Kill all Humans"".  That's it.  The Cavils pretty much make this fact non-negotiable.

Without going into spoilers, I'll point this out: Cavil's PLAN with the Galactica and the surviving Colonial Fleet is literally cartoonish in its plotting and execution.  Cavil CONSTANTLY whines and complains and bitches about the Fleet surviving the attack, yet he NEVER just outright destroys the fleet.

Obviously the Cylon fleet cannot catch up with the Colonials, and the Cylons on board the Galactica cannot contact the Cylon fleet directly, but there's so many ways they could have destroyed Galactica or destroyed the Fleet ships, and yet Cavil's actions to carry out the PLAN consist of... have Aaron Doral (Cylon) be a suicide bomber and blow himself up somewhere.  Or... have Sharon Valerii (Cylon) damage the water systems.  Or... have Shelly Godfrey (Cylon) try to discredit Gaius Baltar.

Cavil creates overly complicated plans all leading towards the destruction of the Fleet, but NONE of them are as direct or effective as ""Blow up the engine"" or ""Manipulate someone to lead the Fleet into a Cylon trap"".  It's always half-crazed, ridiculous plots like ""Blow up a minor, insignificant ship"", ""Kill Commander Adama"", those sorts of things.

Meanwhile, we also follow another Cavil on Caprica, following along with Samuel Anders' guerrilla band against the Cylons.  His is the better story, as he begins to feel they were mistaken in trying to kill all humans, and showing the utterly alien notions of humanity to the Cylons, best exemplified when he asks Anders why he still loves certain members of his band, even though they are now dead.

The idea of no longer loving someone because they are dead is something so utterly alien to us, yet it shows us just how alien the Cylons are, at least this early into the series.  Caprica-Cavil is not so alien, though, that he comes to understand this concept, and all at once begins to change, as opposed to Galactica-Cavil, whose hatred of humans only grows the more his daffy schemes are quashed.

Aside from that, ""The Plan"" is a gift for Battlestar Galactica fans who want/need more after the end of the series.  Killer music and a great opening scene which shows the attack on the colonies with much more explicitness than the series offered.",1275091200,,2933,4.983572895277208

What basically goes on here are scenes from the 1st two seasons of Battlestar Galactica are revisited and then taken further in depth from the Cylons', mostly Cavil's, point of view. Nothing earth shattering is going on here, but die hard fans of the series should enjoy this.

I thought it would describe what events led the Cylons to dream up a ""plan"" and attack the humans.  However, it only depicted selected events from Seasons 1 and 2 of BSG from a different point of view.  Although some plot points were interesting and there was bit more character development, it was hardly worth making a 2 hour movie.  Not to mention I thought the title was misleading.  SPOILER ALERT.  It gave the impression that the Cylons had some other plan than the annihilation of the human race.  But no, that was the big plan.  Sorry, no revelation there.",1274832000,2,684,4.540983606557377
3934826,4,B002HRF68A,"Battlestar Galactica's desperate crew members were always great recyclers. Short on replacement parts, they kept their aging spaceships humming by reusing whatever bits and pieces of technology they had lying around. That recycling continues in 'Battlestar Galactica: The Plan'.

Even after all this time, (having purchased this original release last year), I'm still torn over this final Battlestar movie. It's good, but it's not great - it's fun, but it's far from perfect - it's interesting, but at times feels incomplete or leaves you feeling somewhat frustrated in wanting that little bit more exposition or other issues addressed.

But there are some real gems to be found and savoured here if you're prepared to look for them: like the storyline between Cavill and The Boy, which I found particularly rewarding and moving (wonderfully played as ever, by Dean Stockwell), the internal struggle that the Cylon model Simon (Rick Worthy) undergoes, and the tenderness towards his human wife that he retains, is powerful, and sheds new light on this previously mysterious model. There are also wonderful moments with Ellen, Shelley Godfrey and more. There IS much to be savoured here, but maybe like most spreads, it's spread a little too thinly at times and leaves you wanting more.

The real price of admission, however, is two-fold: Firstly, for Dean Stockwell's performance as Brother Cavill. I've always felt he was the most conflicted and complex of all the 'original' models and this film serves as his star turn. He is everywhere -- at once a priest on the Galactica, a resistance warrior on New Caprica, scheming on the baseship. It's equally fun watching him boiling with frustration that The Plan isn't coming to fruition, snapping at his fellow Cylons, and every dry, sardonic aside in-between. The second being the masterstroke that is the Cylons devastating attack on Caprica which is truly quite something to behold, coupled with an amazing score from bear McReary that really comes into its own during this long scene.

Edward James Olmos directs this movie as only someone so intimately familiar with the material can. Reshot scenes on Caprica and supplements to Galactica footage feel seamlessly in place, as though rewatching major plot points unfold from the series again in real time - just from the perspective of others - which of course, is the entire point.

Whether you enjoyed it or not, to dimiss the hard work and effort that actually DID go into bringing this all together into a cohesive whole is just plain insulting and dismissive to those involved. It couldn't have been easy to weave in the major Cylon moments of the series (the attack, the human resistance, Boomer carrying out her orders, etc.) without coming off as disjointed, gimmicky or bloated, but for the most part it is done beautifully. (If anyone is under any illusion that this was some mere hack job, they really need to watch the extras - particularly how the original version of the scene between Ellen and Cavill was to play out, as this only goes to prove how EJO's attention to detail and pacing paid off here in droves - the way it was re-edited into the attack scenes works amazingly well and really ups the ante and the tension).

So far, so good. So...what didn't I like? Well, for one - I was so disapointed that there was no real further exposition to the saga of The Olympic Carrier (personally, I've always been convinced that the voice that is heard over the Talk Wireless during its reappearance is the Simon model Cylon). I thought it would have been really interesting to have found out what really did happen on that ship when it vanished. Were those ""thousand some-odd souls"" killed? Experimented upon? Airlocked? ...Did Apollo really end up killing a ship full of innocents, or were there no passengers left on it as we suspected? For me, I felt like this was such a shame this opportunity was missed to truly tie that up once and for all.

That's my one major gripe. The other is not so much a gripe, more a personal opinion down to taste. The series finale 'Daybreak' served as a wonderful coda for the show, but 'The Plan' somehow seems to dilute and take away from that experience. Yes, I too was clamouring for more. But somehow, for all it's good intentions, 'The Plan' just sadly doesn't quite seem to hit the mark it was aiming for. This is not to say it's bad - it's most certainly not, but after watching it, I felt like I had somehow cheapened my beginning middle and end with Battlestar.

Those who have not had the pleasure of watching the show and are yet to take the journey, be strongly advised - this will blow pretty much everything for you if you make the mistake of thinking you should watch this first.

Therein lies the greatest weakness of the show.

Since to a great degree we know all these characters extremely well it is hard to add a lot to their characters. We get to know the Cylons much better (the whole point of the movie) but not in the depth that I'd have liked.

Being a parent, one of the opening scenes of the mini-series that haunted me for a long time was 6 breaking the neck of the baby. The expression on her face was just on the side of implacable that you sort of get the impression that she is starting to wonder about her role in everything. I was hoping to have closure on this this scene since there were two other scenes involving children (dream sequence where Adama drowns Hera and 6 losing Tigh's baby) and I was hoping that some loop would be drawn. That never happened.

I was hoping to see more Leoben and something to make Doral seem like less of an oaf.

Finally, many scenes just pop up without context so anyone who has not seen the whole series will be completely lost.

These points though are heavily counterbalanced by the excellent dialog and thoughtfulness that went into the rest of the movie.

3934835,4,B002HRF68A,"""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" is a film based on the Cylons Plan ""B"" to eliminate the Human Race, told mostly from the Cylons point of view. For the true ""BSG"" fan there is much to recommend this story and the way it is told. True to one of the major themes throughout four years of ""BSG"" narrative, The Plan shows ""Our enemy is more like us than we would like to admit."" The Cylon foe in ""BSG"" is no more monolithic in its practice than the Humans are.

One thing I do miss in The Plan, is the humor from the the first two seasons of GALACTICA. Humor would not be appropriate here, as this is a grim and earnest story.

While many story and character elements within the GALACTICA 'verse were filled out and expanded in The Plan, as a fan I was disappointed after viewing this DVD. Unfairly,I was expecting more answers. But this is DVD called ""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" NOT ""Battlestar Galactica: The Answers"". (Maybe next year.)

What this film did do was flesh out some areas of question, but not in as satisfying a way as one would have liked.

Spoiler Alert: Do not proceed if you don't want to know...

It seems to me that the PLAN kind of evolved as they went along, that they didn't really have as clear a Plan as was implied. I mean, yes, they wanted to exterminate humanity. Failing that, they sought them out to finish the job - but came to an epiphany through their ""planted"" agents, this being that humanity still had much to teach the Cylons. The evidence is in the repeated phrase, ""This has happened before"", or however it was specifically said. The point is that embedded deep within their pysche, if the Cylons can have that, as it appears they can, and during the series we learn how that came to be, they knew something about the cyclical nature of the ""ride"" they were on. History was repeating itself, and they knew it. How many cycles they had experienced was yet unknown, if that ever could be known. The challenge became - the Plan became - how to break the cycle. But we learned that during the series.

Well, now, if you're a die hard fan of the show, you will find it necessary to own this. I mean, I'm glad I bought it and watched it. It was like having one more visit with old friends, if you will, in a similar way we watched the ""sequel"" material of Babylon 5, because we wanted to return to that universe and visit again for a while. So in that sense, it was satisfying. I just wish there were more done to justify the release.

I did like this movie's development of Anders' resistance on occupied Caprica.  In the series it was only shown for 3 or 4 episodes, so it was nice to see more of it.

The thought that Cavil was willing to silence others of his own model to push his own agenda to finish off what they had started on trying to wipe out the humans was a side we did not see in the original series.  In fact, if that other model had not been boxed, there may have been a quicker end to the whole series.  That Cavil was like the puppet master organizing the other agents in the fleet was not in the series.  That Sharon was being directed by Cavil, was not in the original series.  In fact in the series, you were lead to believe that Sharon was ""programmed"" to take out Adama.

3934858,3,B002HRF68A,"For me, ""BG: The Plan"" came out a little late in the game, long after I'd watched the series conclusion on TV.  It essentially covers, in two hours, the BSG series from just before the Cylon attacks on the colonies to the time when the Brothers Cavill (the Cylon played by Dean Stockwell) get blown out the airlock.  BSG: TP is all about the Cyclon point of view, filling in a few narrative blanks here and there, concentrating primarily on two incarnations of Cavill and their respective viewpoints, with some addtional attention paid to the remaining Cylons and how different they are from their model copies.

The show takes some footage from the BSG series and uses it in the storyline, but a lot of what's presented is new footage.  Cavill's interaction with a human boy on the battlestar is particularly interesting and, in the end, shocking while not necessarily surprising given his incarnation's opinion of the human race.

Some of the more interesting theological and philosophical reasons alluded to in the early part of series are completely ignored, maybe even avoided.

Make no mistake, this is a clip show. A good percentage of what you see in this movie is stuff you've already seen. Many of the characters you grew to love in the show only show up here in clips (such as Starbuck). There is a good percentage of new stuff as well. You see a lot more of what happened with Anders and Co. on Caprica, and it's interesting to see the two Cavil's in their respective handling of the human survivors.

This is not outstanding BSG. It is good BSG. It is a clip show. It is worth it to see, but not one you might watch over and over again.

I also was suprised of how the married cylon handled his mission to destroy a colonial ship.

I really expected it to be about the Cylons' thought processes leading into the attack on the colonies, and further explore what instigated and lead to the attacks.  Instead, it plays like  a recap of everything that happens over the course of the series, just from different perspectives.  There are certainly some good moments and a few interesting revelations, but overall, I was less than impressed.

Aside from a lack of real substance, there was the addition of random nudity at several points in the movie.  I am certainly not opposed to seeing a little skin, but it really served no purpose in the context of the story and felt really inconsistent with the TV series.  The TV series was about being edgy, and pushing the limits of what they could do on TV.  I felt like the series was actually sexier since they only teased you with Six, but never actually revealed everything.  The nudity didn't ruin the show, it just seemed weird and out of place.

3934869,1,B002HRF68A,"""The Plan"" offers nothing new to the BSG storyline, absolutely nothing. Archive material was used ad nauseum. Jamie Bamber, Katee Sackhoff,  et aL actors you'd expect to see listed, aren't. It's old footage (I had been watching Season Two in anticipation of getting ""The Plan"" from my son as a Christmas present). Edward James Olmos directed this mess, and perhaps his reward was the casting of his wife, it certainly was not to show his prowess in telling a non-story. Indeed the theme which Olmos and the writers attempt to convey isn't about Cylons or even the divine interventions that happen throughout the series, but is about how love endures even after death. And the viewer isn't allowed to discover or take the journey of discovery to come up with it himself, but instead the viewer is clubbed over the head with it over and over again. Why are the writers telling us this rather than showing us?
Much of a BSG's fan's time has been spent watching or reading podcasts by Moore or Eick as they explain their thoughts and motives behind what was shown. In other words, either they didn't tell the story in the way they wanted it told, or they failed to convey the message they wanted to share and had to go back and clarify things. ""The Plan"" will not need a podcast to explain its arc, since we are told about it over and over again to the point of distraction.
Olmos and friends have produced a piece that didn't need done. Nothing new, nothing exceptional was presented to the audience. For example, perhaps the most prominent example of unnecessary were the nude scenes in the pilot's locker room. Since Season One, six years ago, fans have known that men and women share the same quarters and facilities. By this time we all have assumed that they've seen each other au natural. Viewers didn't need the concept handed to them. But, for some reason, perhaps to increase DVD sales and rentals, Olmos goes to nudity twice. If nudity has a purpose, say ""Titanic""/ Rose posing for a pic, then certainly it can be argued that it was necessary. In ""The Plan"" it's superfluous.
I'm happy my son bought this DVD for me. It saved me from cursing over the lost of $20; or from waiting six months, digging through copies of every Earnest video ever made, and wasting $5 buying it out of the Walmart discard bin. I'll be happy to loan this out to friends or family after I've given them the appropriate caveat. But I will not recommend this feldgercarb to anyone.",1261958400,5,2463,4.597727272727273
3934870,4,B002HRF68A,"BSG: The Plan is not quite a movie but a bit more than a 3-episode arc.

It answered a number of season 1 and 2 questions but left me longing for another installment that provided more insight into season 3 and 4.

I can't rate this five stars because it felt too rough around the edges.  It is laid out in a somewhat linear, but very disjointed manner.  Various nagging anomalies are still left hanging.  Additionally, the level of nudity and sexual scenes felt more forced than artistic.  This installment, more so than any part of the modern BSG epic, is definitely intended not for kids.

3934873,4,B002HRF68A,"""The Cylons were created by man. They evolved. They rebelled. There are many copies, and they have a plan."" So began the opening of every episode of Battlestar Galactica. Through four seasons we saw the near genocide of the human race through the eyes of the humans, now with The Plan, we see it through the eyes of the Cylons.

It took me a while to get into the cultural phenomenon that is Battlestar Galactica. Throughout it's run I was never really interested in checking it out, but finally after going on enough message boards filled with phrases like ""frak this"" ""frak that"" and ""what the frak"" I had to check it out. I borrowed the first season from a friend earlier this year and got hooked. After that I bought all the rest of the seasons and wasted no time watching them all. Battlestar Galactica has become more than just a fan favorite show, though, it's also become the only show in history to have the UN hold a symposium in it's honor, and has even affected the way the UN writes policies. Now, I should say that I'm not here to get into a fandom debate about what science fiction show has had more cultural impact (after all, Star Trek hosted the first interracial kiss on network television), but rather the (possibly?) final installment in the story of Galactica has recently been released on DVD. The question: does it hold up to the series?

 In all honesty, The Plan is a mixed bag. Directed by the series own Edward James Olmos (Captain Adama), The Plan looks and feels like a two hour episode of the show, if just a little more involved. In most cases, the decisions made on this show do a great job of moving the story along, but cutting them film to remind us who the ""final 5"" Cylons were is great for viewers who are just getting into the series through The Plan, but I would hope that most people would choose not to start here since it would cause you to loose some of the mystery of the show itself. Overall though, the writing and directing is solid, and like the rest of the series touches on pertinent sociopolitical themes: family quibbles leading to war, totalitarianism, genocide, etc.

One of the really great things about The Plan is that the main character is the wise cracking Cylon Brother Cavil. Dean Stockwell plays Cavil with a giddy glee at the thought of genocide, and his character's enthusiasm is infectious, even if you are rooting for the humans. Most of the main characters aren't really seen much, but the performances we do see are right in line with what we remember from the series, and the movie gives us an interesting view of the other side of things.

But while the movie starts out great, it eventually loses it's way. The destruction of the 12 colonies, and the scenes on Caprica are the best, but it's not easy to try to cram two seasons worth of info into just under two hours. This isn't the biggest problem with the movie though, the biggest problem has to do with the fact that this movie doesn't really add much to the proceedings. Since the writers didn't really plan the series as they went along, the Cylons don't really have a plan. So, while there are moments that make you go, ""Oh okay, that makes sense,"" there's nothing here to answer the many questions that were left at the end of the season finale.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it fit well with the series even if it didn't add anything. The general rule with this installment in the series is probably going to be something to the effect of: If you liked the series finale you'll probably like this, if you didn't this probably won't be your cup of tea. When checking this out, I have to warn you, where the series could be graphic at times, The Plan takes things a little further adding in a little extra gore and quite a bit of male and female nudity. It would be advisable to check this out before showing your children.

3934876,3,B002HRF68A,"Unfortunately for BSG fans, The Plan suffers from many of the same problems as the other BSG stand-alone movie, Razor; it's not very illuminating. The fact is both films focus on things we already knew about in the BSG-verse. In The Plan it's the holocaust of the Colonies, the fact that the Cavill's are evil, that he manipulated the Final Five, that Boomer was a sleeper agent, and that some of the skin-job Cylons had reservations about the holocaust. We learn very little new here, and the tale is told in more of a travelougue-style series of disconnected vignettes rather than a cohesive plot with a beginning, middle, and end.

Some of the revelations are far from jaw-dropping; Caprica Six secretly met Cavill after manipulating Baltar on Caprica; all of the ""Final Five"" had hints that ""this has happened before""; the Doral cylons aren't very bright; and ultimately we just don't give a damn about Sam Anders and his pyramid team, the Caprica Bucs. The only truly new information we get is that one of the Simon's was in love with his human wife and adopted child, that love changes things for the cylons, and a small bit about Caprica Six and Boomer really trying for a truce with the human race. Unfortunately this sub-plot was almost entirely left out of The Plan, and can only be seen via the ""Deleted Scenes"" Bonus Features.

In the end none of this (not even the nude scenes, which don't feature any of the series stars naked, sorry) really adds much to the cannon of BSG, nor does it make up for the lack of an ending that Ron Moore gave us just six months ago in the series finale. Ultimately we are still left wanting more, more answers, more mind-frakking twists and turns like the series gave us. The Plan mostly fails to deliver on any of this. If we are ever to venture into BSG-land again, Ron Moore, please don't give us your tired left-overs, give us what we got hooked on, or just don't make the effort.",1260921600,10,1929,4.556195965417867

For the first 3 seasons we were reminded constantly that the Cylons 'have a plan' during the intro sequence of each and every episode of BSG. I, like many, really hoped that plan would be laid out in a way that paid us off for having had to endure the reminders over 100+ episodes (it became a running joke among my friends and I as we watched the show). When the show itself didn't deliver anything meaningful aside from Cavel trying to get revenge on the final five 'creators,' it seemed like we would all be out of luck. When THE PLAN was announced, I had some hope that FINALLY we would all understand what the Cylons were up to aside from the obvious.

SPOILER ALERT

Well, what was the amazing plan revealed in the first 20 minutes of this true bomb of a movie? The plan was to kill all humans. Yes you read that right. I thought that was beyond obvious in the show itself and didn't really need any explanation, but the Cavel character literally states ""the plan was to kill all humans"" at one point, just in case you missed it. Nothing is mentioned about the farms on Caprica where Kara Thrace was held, nor the plan to try and breed human/cylon hybrids. Nothing is explained surrounding the mysterious connection with Leoben, although it is hinted at with new scenes of Leoben painting the same colorful universe painting that Kara did during the original show. Bottom line, there are no interesting revelations to be found here, just hash and re-hash of old material and boring characters (seriously, Cavel is so irritating it is almost infuriating to watch. Petty, silly, and all too childish to really fear).

What follows the shocking revelation that the Cylon plan was to ""Kill all humans"" is about 90 more minutes of wasted time in which original BSG scenes are smashed together into something resembling a seriously long vignette of important parts of the first three seasons of BSG. This is done in shoddy fashion. The art direction of THE PLAN is far inferior to the original show. Cheap 3d rendered environments that look video game like (think of mid 2000s graphics), bad camera work (home camera quality at times) and no sense of style that made the original a feast for the eyes. This is just a BAD movie all the way around.

The show also re-write history (so to speak) by showing how Cavel was personally responsible for just about everything negative that happened on Galactica, the fleet, and even New Caprica. This sort of simplification damages the original story by making the Cylons (and especially their hidden operatives) look like unmotivated, error prone buffoons. By the end of THE PLAN you'll wonder how the Cylons didn't off themselves with all their silly mistakes and lack of insight.

It's incomprehensible why they thought they needed another 2 hours to drudge through the same material. You can safely skip THE PLAN and not miss anything. Razer looks like Academy Award material compared to this.

On paper, it must have sounded like a great add-on to explore the Cylon side of the story in the first two seasons of the show. The problem is that seeing the Cylon's putting into process their plan to destroy the human race actually steals something important from the tv series. One of the things that made the show so engaging was that I experienced the siege mentality the humans developed as they fled from this all-powerful race of robots who worked as one mind. It wasn't until later that some of the Cylon's seemed to develop personality and became relatable as individuals. In The Plan, seeing them as flawed, sometimes child like individuals that somehow managed to destroy billions of humans makes everything seem less plausible.

It seems a mistake to compress two seasons of a show into a relatively short movie, and as such the engagement is superficial at best, forced at worst.

Overall, an experience that weakens the show rather than contributes towards it.",1259712000,,1115,4.802083333333333

The actual ""Plan"" which I had hoped would be some complex, revealing twist turns out to be a complete anticlimax (I'm trying to stop short of spoiling it if that's possible.)
It was a little interesting to see (almost) all of the Cylon models with enough frequency to actually keep track of which is which. In the long run, I'd say the missing element was an actual plot line. Most of the footage was old which could be deemed an excuse to not be able to introduce a new story ... but anyone who has seen ""Dead men don't wear plaid"" knows it can be done.  <-- (I'm guessing that's the first time *that* movie was referenced in the same conversation as BSG :-0)",1259539200,,859,4.269938650306749

3934905,3,B002HRF68A,"First of all, I felt that the ending for the BSG series really killed the series, but as a rather devoted fan of the series I decided to see The Plan anyways.  The title indicated that it would reveal the complexities and nuances of the Cylon plan, as well as tying up the loose ends that were left unanswered.

As far as tying up the loose ends goes, I thought they did that rather well.  They explained who the 6 was meeting on Caprica, they showed how the rebels got started on Caprica.  They explained how Boomer worked.  I was always wondering what her deal was.  I thought they programmed her but instead hypnosis was involved.  They showed how the Cylons in the fleet were being orchestrated.

The Cylon plan was actually pretty simple, destroy all the humans, we knew that much from watching the series.  The plan for the Cylons on the fleet was really non-existent.  They didn't have plan, they were just winging it.  I thought that the biggest weakness of the movie was the amount of scenes added in from the series.  I would guess that about a third of the movie was just scenes taken from the series.  I didn't really want to see all that again, or if I do, I would rather see it by rewatching the series.  But I watched it anyways because I was bored and lazy with nothing else to do.  I think that a major problem BSG is that the way they ended it puts a cap on the storyline that precludes any possibility for a sequel, so they're stuck either doing prequels (like Caprica) or elaborating on the storyline that is already there.  If you choose the latter option then it is going to be hard to do it without integrating footage from the series.  I think if the writers for the BSG SERIES had been smart they would have ended it in such a way that more could be made in the way of series and movies so that they could make it into a franchise, sort of like Star Trek.",1259366400,,1880,4.280453257790368

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem long enough to actually tell the full story.  Still, it does a good job of reinforcing the central themes of Battlestar Galactica: the interference of a 'higher power' in the design of what happens and love causing changes and having unexpected influences on people, Cylon and human alike.  After all, they're both the same in the end, right?  All in all a good end cap to the BSG series for fans.

Lots of this movie is rehashed from the first season, with some new footage focusing on Dean Stockwell's character, Number One.  But the movie also doesn't jibe with the series.  At the beginning of the film, we see Stockwell and other cylons walking among  the as-yet-unresurrected Final Five before the strike on Caprica.  In the series, though, they did not know who the final five were, not at first.  They sought to discover their identity just as eagerly as the humans did.

The polar opposite personalities between Cavil and John really helped frame how the Cylons headed down the path of destruction they did.  I also enjoyed learning more about Simon and seeing that he was another Cylon who loved a human so deeply.

It was okay to watch once especially for the great CGI effects of the cylon base stars mounting their attack on the twelve colonies.

3934919,4,B002HRF68A,"""The Plan"" is not for people new to Battlestar Galactica (BSG).  If you've followed the series, then it is going to inspire mixed feelings.  Overall, I liked it, but I can see how others may not.

This is the BSG story from the Cylon perspective.  A few characters get inserted into the old timeline, a lot of footage is recycled, depth is added to the saga, and the story of how Ellen Tigh escaped the nuclear attack is revealled.

It would be easy to accuse the makers of BSG of milking the cash cow, but I think the back-story in ""The Plan"" is along the lines of ""Razor"".  You can watch and follow the series as broadcast, but the extended episodes and movies fill in blanks and enrich the epic.  The politicking and behind the scenes stories of events that appeared in the series put those events in a whole new light, and enrich the understanding of the Cylon approach and outlook.

A good addition to BSG.

Definition:

Something not built according a design or plan, but assembled from whatever is available to 'make do.'

Kludge
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A kludge (or kluge) is a workaround, a quick-and-dirty solution, a clumsy or inelegant, yet effective, solution to a problem, typically using parts that are cobbled together. This term is diversely used in fields such as computer science, aerospace engineering, Internet slang, and evolutionary neuroscience.

The Plan is a perfect example of a Kluge.  Worse yet, it changes characters and relationships from the series, and even changes the story line.  The idea here was that there was not democracy and voting among the Cylons, they were all controlled to one degree or another by Brother Cavil, who knew who the final five were from the beginning.  This may attempt to be an ""effective solution"" to a 4-5 year series with many plot holes and inconsistencies, but it ends up feeling ""quick and dirty"".  If you have to change the story to try to tie it together, then better off leaving the questions unanswered.",1258848000,,1102,5.0777777777777775
3934921,5,B002HRF68A,"The Film

First off, this is NOT a clip show. If these reviewers even bothered to watch the movie, they would know that the majority of the film (at LEAST 75%) is entirely new footage. They only use old footage to provide the context to understand when the events are occuring. And the reused footage is often from different camera angles, and not exactly what was seen before. The integration of new and old footage is so well done that it gets hard to tell them apart. The visual effect shots are all entirely new (and absolutely stunning). The acting remains fantastic. There are entirely new music tracks, as well as a couple old familiar ones that are sometimes remixed and used at appropriate places in the time line of the story.

Secondly, this film is not really for newcomers to BSG. It might make limited sense to a newcomer, but there is no way you'd get the same appreciation for it, since this is the LAST installment of Battlestar, and spoils the entire preceding series.

For those who have seen BSG, the film itself is not pointless, and not just a reliving of earlier days on Galactica. It has it's own narrative and a plot. It's mainly a study of the motivations of the Cylons, as led by Cahvil, and how their plan (kill all humans) fell apart because of obsession and love. We already knew that they had hated the colonials enough to purge them from the universe, but not enough of an understanding of what precipitated the Cylon Civil War, and why they would ever ally with the Colonials, or why the Occupation wasn't just a wholesale slaughter of humans.

The only real faults of the film was it's pacing, which at first is too quick, and then it becomes too slow. And then there was too much that was glossed over, scenes that felt underplayed, and events that I couldn't help feel like should have been in the film (Olympic Carrier anyone?). And it only covered the time line of the first two seasons, still leaving a lot to be inferred. With so much left out and rushed through, I feel that it might have worked better, and have been more clear to it's purpose as a longer piece. Although there may yet be another BSG movie, since EJO has strongly alluded to that possibility.

Overall I find it a satisfying addition and enhancement of the story.

The Product

The packaging on this one is fine. I saw a lot of people have package issues with the full series box set, but that is not the case here. And in fact I was impressed the seal was surprisingly easy to remove (I've had many bad experiences with these on other DVDs). The disc has some rather nice extras. Unfortunately EJO and Espenson aren't nearly as good as Moore when it comes to commentary, yet they still share some interesting insights on their work.

Rating

Normally I'd give it 4 stars, since the film has it's faults. But I'm giving it 5 to offset the morons who say it's a clipshow, when it's not, and give it only one star on that basis alone, neglecting all it's good stuff. Sure it aint perfect, but I wouldn't have even reviewed this (I'm lazy) if it didn't irk me so badly how some people are bashing it.",1258675200,2,3106,4.454225352112676
3934922,3,B002HRF68A,"I had to review this in the three parts that made up The Plan, because something can be missed in trying to sum up the entire show as a whole. As these three parts take up nearly a third of the show each this is rather easy; the difficulty lies in how to judge how well they were put together.

Firstly, the ""Fleet"" sequences. Sure, a lot of the new stuff was good, even if the nudity (yes, some people ""get nekkid"" in The Plan) seems a little gratuitous, but overall it was new camera angles of clips from previous episodes. While the idea was to get a sense of the cylon viewpoint, it seems more that stock footage was used to save on production costs. After all, why have some actors return to Vancouver to reprise scenes already completed? Just use the different camera angles to give that illusion. Also, there were subtle image-quality differences between that filmed for, say, the mini-series and that made for The Plan- most apparent after Six's famous ""It's about time you got here"" line was followed up upon. Overall, one star. Had there been more original work in this section I'd have rated this higher, but for the most part I found the fleet sequences disappointing.

Second, the ""Resistance"" segment. As the majority of this had to be new footage, here's where The Plan begins to markedly improve. The interplay between Anders, Brother Cavill, and the other resistance members was very well done; Brother Cavill trying to find some sense of absolution for the near-annihilation of humanity from Anders, who has no idea what he is, while Simon's (strangely) clueless about Anders being one of the ""Final (actually, original) Five."" The others in the resistance cell play their parts as athletes-turned-partisans very well, and I found the ""resistance"" segment quite enjoyable overall. Had a few deleted scenes been included, it'd have given it a full five-stars, but there were story gaps that were left on the cutting-room floor so I'll go four stars here.

And finally, the CGI. Here's where they pulled out all the stops. The new imagery was amazing, and we finally had a sense of life on the Twelve Colonies just as they were destroyed. The Hybrid's almost-poetic recital of the ""status reports"" combined with the before-and-after images of the various locations can easily be the highlight of the show. While we had allusions as to what the various colonies were like, it was only as they were being destroyed that we (finally) knew what places the individual worlds held in the Colonial collective consciousness. ""The farms of Aerilon, the plains of Tauron..."" Other CGI images (like the MIRV over Caprica) were also well-crafted. In CGI The Plan truly shines, thus five stars.

Overall, I had to give The Plan three stars. While the CGI and ""Resistance"" segments were well done, the ""Fleet"" sequences could have been much better. Even the brief pre-attack sequences seemed ""thrown together"" in order to give a sense of where the ""Final Five"" were when the bombs fell. (I'm sorry, but did Ellen Tigh always hang out in strip clubs when Saul was deployed or do Piconese waitresses simply work in nothing but g-strings?) The Plan was, overall, an enjoyable wrap-up to the latest incarnation of ""Battlestar Galactica,"" but there was so much more the writers and producers could have done.",1258675200,2,3305,4.833922261484099

3934926,3,B002HRF68A,"I don't know how else to describe my reaction to this DVD.

I enjoyed watching it, recapturing that same sense of anticipation that I recalled from the early seasons of BSG - enjoying the character moments while trying to figure out, deduce what exactly was the Cylon plan that we were teased with in the show's opening every week.

But at the end of the DVD, I experienced the same let down as the series finale... That was it? I was dragged thru an emotional roller-coaster again only to be told the ride is over at the top of the track.

This DVD encompasses all that was good and bad about BSG.

The characters and the character moments sparkle. The dialogue and the acting is first-rate and evoked my fond memories of the series. The problem is, like the series, that's all this really is... a series of character moments (and most pulled from the old episodes). There is no real story here. Like the series, you get to the end and want to say ""Is that it?"". Yeah, I know the BSG creators lamely used the excuse that the show was always meant to just be about the characters, but c'mon, that is just a poor excuse for lazy, lazy writing. I had hoped and half-way expected this DVD was the show's runners' way of after-the-fact filling in the plot holes for the series, but instead it's just another opportunity squandered.

Nevertheless, you will probably want to buy this DVD if you were more than a casual fan of the show. Understand that it is in essence a ""clip-show"" interspersed with a good number of fresh scenes that enhance and expand on the older fare but really add nothing much to any kind of story arc.

Bottom-line: Good, but could have been so much more...",1258329600,,1676,4.46078431372549
3934927,5,B002HRF68A,"The Plan goes back to the very beginning of the (mini) series, and explores the circumstances with the human-like Cylons preparing and executing the massive attack on the Twelve colonies, and then continuing with the ""mopping up"" afterwards in the Rag-tag Fleet and with the Survivors on Caprica.  It is almost all done from the perspective of the 12 or so Cylons, as they carry out their duties and discuss their assignments.  It carries the ""feel"" of about 2 hours of ""Deleted Scenes"", in mostly chronological order.  Most of the scenes are very short, but reveal crucial details on who knew and did what and when, and the scenes are full of what would be ""spoilers"" if they were included in the original series release.  One would need to be very well-studied as a BSG aficionado in the entire series to really catch all the subtle points.

Incidentally, there are also some ""real"" Deleted Scenes at the end, without the ""VFX"" Video (CGI) Effects, but which do seem to fill in some odd ""holes"" in the running dialog.  The parallel story lines as presented do flip back and forth between settings, and make references to ""known"" timeline events on Galactica, and on post-apocalypse Caprica, and elsewhere.  A Time Stamp (xx days after the attack on the colonies) frequently provides points of reference at the beginning of some scenes.  And there are a number of previously unexplored relationships presented between and among the various Cylon models.

Notably absent is the President, D'Anna, and any reference to Razor or Pegasus.  One of the surprises is that the Cylons, including the Final Five, always seem to recognize each other in some way in passing, even if they are not always sure why.  One disappointment is no added clarifications of Starbuck's status.

Some have argued that The Plan is a simple money-grab, using stock footage (etc.) to trick BSG fans into thinking it is a new ""episode"" or something.  It should rather be thought of and treated as crucial scenes and spoiler segments that were withheld, but are a significant part of the Canon.  I would argue that, when taken in context with the rest of the material, it fills in some otherwise unexpected and unexplained gaps in the main BSG storyline.  It starts to clarify how the Humans and Cylons started to adapt and come to terms with their respective circumstances.  Interestingly it only seemed to cover about the first 2 or so ""regular"" seasons; one wonders if there is to be a second Plan - Part 2 - that covers Seasons 3 and 4...",1258329600,3,2513,4.782407407407407

If you are so jonesing for BSG that you are willing to sit through half repeat scenes/half scenes that should have seen the chop block, then you will probably still like this. But if, like me, you were hoping for insight into the psyche and earlier motivatins of the Cylon, then you will be BORED and dissatisfied halfway through when you realize that there is no substance here.

And the dialogue is atrocious. Brother Cavil is the lead and some of his one-liners are abominably bad. Yes, he actually says, ""Let's get this genocide started."" Wow.",1258329600,4,758,4.823076923076923
3934929,4,B002HRF68A,"If you go in to this expecting a big follow on movie or even another Razor then you will probably be very disappointed. From what I had read about the Plan I did not get my self too excited as I knew this was going to go back and cover some issues from the pilot up to season 2 and that footage from those two seasons would be used so I was expecting some small back track kind of story and on the most part I was right.
  But it is actually in my opinion a very good film with a lot of new material the opening attack on the colonies is very cool to watch and looks good despite what you might read else where also there is quite a lot of back story on Anders and the rebels not enough unfortunately if there was more on the rebels and the struggle against the Cylon occupation this film would have been even better.
 The Plan is really about two of Cavils models and the Plan they have for humanity which too be honest is little more than to kill us. One of them is a bit sympathetic to us and the other is the Cavil we know who is damn right evil and hates humanity.
 There are no major surprises on the way but a few holes are filled in without really revealing any thing new to the fan and if you are reading this I take it that you are a fan of the show if not don't start with the Plan.
 Even though this is far from the best BSG has to offer it is still quite good if not brilliant and has the same feel as the rest of the series I think that some people have missed the point and expected way to much from this film, but I also hope this is not the last film made there could be better.

This revisits the first one and half seasons of the show, (with a pre-cursor as well) filling in blanks you didn't even realise were there. At best it extends the original and challenges your original understanding of events in the series. At worst it feels like an ugly revision test. The confusion sets in when there's an easy recollection of some characters and scenes... and then other characters slide right in, until you begin to doubt if you've seen these characters before...

The production flows quickly with vignettes rather than scenes.  A viewer not completely familiar with the show, would be lost and frustrated.  Like most fans, I would have preferred a fresh, new production with all of my favorite characters.  I was disappointed in the absence of Laura Roslin.  Lee Adama and Kara Thrace seemed ghost-like in their brief appearances- all clips from the past.  But, I knew the format of The Plan before viewing it.

What I appreciated about the production was that despite being a collection of snippets, EJO was very effective in weaving the story together and making it meaningful.  Dean Stockwell's performance is pure genius.  I also appreciate that Simon now has his own story and isn't just a Cylon in the background.  I felt that the literal poetry presented in the opening scene- with the Hybrid and the final scene-with Fleet Cavil, was a nice touch.",1258156800,,1155,4.8520408163265305

Maybe, just maybe the story looked actually decent on paper but it so didn't work on screen. There was no coherent plot line. The movie simply jumped from episode to episode and introduced new characters that we had never seen before.  When the plan of the Cylons was revealed, I had to say that I was very disappointed. Not only because anyone who has ever read Milton will recognize it right away but also because it was childish and lame.

3934939,3,B002HRF68A,"For the most part, Battlestar Galactica: The Plan satisfies many expectations while simultaneously disappointing in other areas. Prior to its release, fans had been given some general idea as to what this two-hour special would be about: that it would somehow concern the five final cylons and the participation of the cylons designated as Number One -- or the ""Brother Cavils"" -- in the destruction of the twelve colonies of man as seen in the inaugural miniseries at the start of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-One/dp/B000AJJNFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica  - Season One</a>.

The Final Five are, indeed, very much present and accounted for. As viewers, we are treated to a much more graphic nuclear apocalypse than we'd seen before, portrayed with greater scope as we witness glimpses of the destruction on each of the twelve colonies. We learn a great deal more about the ""Brother Cavils"" and their role in the attack and subsequent events. Most gratifyingly, we finally bond with a Number Four cylon -- a ""Simon"" model -- as it (or rather, he) struggles to reconcile his malevolent machine nature with his newfound love for his very human family. Likewise, Samuel Anders' backstory is fleshed out in greater detail. All to the good, as they say.

Not so good is the exclusion of a more in-depth portrayal of the Final Five's history and their role in cylon culture; a tantalizing plot point mentioned during the series that remains unexplored here. Likewise, the inclusion of generous quantities of stock footage from previous episodes mainly serves to make this film a rather tedious watch for those of us who've seen all this before, however well integrated it may be. Overall, it's as close to a ""collection of clips"" episode as this series has ever come; something that cannot be allowed to occur again if the series is ever to be revisited in future installments. Furthermore, the Region 1 disc release represents yet another missed opportunity to include the 10-part ""The Face of the Enemy"" Web shorts in either Blu-ray or DVD format.

Of course, I enjoyed it to some degree because any BSG is better than no BSG otherwise it would rate a 2. Still, it did remind me that this show was about what it means to be human - ethics, reason, faith, love, etc. The actual series is perhaps one of the few grand works of art to come out of our civilization since the creation of moving pictures and the creators of this series have my gratitude for the absolute joy that I experienced watching it. The Plan falls short of being an episode or a movie. It fills a little gap but that's about it.

I enjoyed every moment of the film. The visuals are outstanding. The music (especially in certain emotionally-charged scenes) beautifully adds to the feeling of sadness and despair. Don't expect to be happy after seeing ""The Plan"". My Gods! Prepare yourself for pretty shocking and depressing moments (and I'm not talking about the often criticized nudity in the film).

Let me congratulate Olmos for the direction, who is in absolute control throughout the whole journey. In addition, the young actress Lymari Nadal (Olmos' wife, by the way) playing the role of Giana O'Neill, makes her appearance for a few minutes in the film but with great style.

3934948,3,B002HRF68A,"Finally watched BSG The Plan last night.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was a bit disappointed.  A few thoughts:

PROS
* Great soundtrack.
* Primary message - it seems that once the initial attack failed to wipe out the human race, the Cylons lost their will to complete the task.  And that is because - to some degree - each of them learned what love looked like and realized that there was something worth saving in humanity.
* More #4 - for one of the 12 models, we saw amazingly little of this guy in the original series (7 episodes total according to IMDB).  It was nice to make a real connection with his character in The Plan.

CONS
* Missing characters - where was Roslin?  And Tory's appearances amounted to a cameo, not a role.
* Sex and nudity - much like Caprica's pilot, this movie had scenes that added absolutely nothing to the storyline.  The only purpose of gratuitous sex scenes seems to be so that someone could say, ""Yeah, we put some sex scenes in there.""  It's almost an insult to their target demographic group to assume that they need those scenes in there to make the movie watchable.

It's worth watching, but I wouldn't have lost any sleep if I'd never seen it.",1257552000,,1201,4.418181818181818
3934949,2,B002HRF68A,"I remember when the previews came out a year ago for this movie.  I was very excited to see it from the perspective of the Cylons, but the Truth of the matter is that this movie should have either never been made, or the writers should have taken a hard look at the incredible series that they had created and written it from a perspective that would have compelled the viewer to  sympathize with the Cylon plight.  I was very disappointed in this film because we do not find anything that drives us to be compassionate toward the Cylons' motives.  I understand that they are machines, subject to their programming, but throughout the entire series we are subjected to cylons that have either exceeded their programming, or supersceded their programming.  All I saw during this film is the anger and nearly unexplicable vengence of one cylon (Dean Stockwell's character).  What happened to the voting and ultimate democracy that we saw throughout the entire series?  The whole need for the cylons to attack was briefly explained away in a few sentences, and then we're rushed through the entire five year series in a couple of hours that are loosely tied together, and bound by the one simple thread of ""humans are a disease.""

One of the things that I really enjoyed about the entire series was that it was extremely complex, and that everyone in the series had their own motives for what they did.  We felt the need to care for each and every character whether they were cylon or human.  I just didn't get that same emotional attachment to ANY character in this movie.  I realize that one movie cannot explain or answer all the questions that evolved throughout the entire series, but there seemed to be too many inconsistencies in the movie as it related to the series.  For example, and here's a spoiler:  The final five were known from the beginning by nearly all the cylons from the start!  What the heck?  And the fact that the final five were placed on various planets as a part of a plan to irradicate the humans?  The fact that they knew they were cylons from the start?  It really cheapens and degrades all the work that was put into the series.

Do yourself a favor:  Don't get this movie if you liked/loved the series.  You will be whole heartedly disgusted.",1257552000,8,2271,4.615960099750623
3934950,2,B002HRF68A,"First, let me say that I am a HUGE BSG fan. Like, nutty huge fan. I pre-ordered ""The Plan"" just to have some more time with the story line and great characters as soon as it came out.

I watched it five minutes after the UPS guy handed it to me. It was like a ""not fully awake"" sensation the whole time I watched it. Familiar characters floated in and out of the almost non existant storyline amongst some very random moments. Like the drunk sorority version of Six having a roll in the bunk with Dean Stockwell's character who seems to be the same the same the same, whatever version of his character he's supposed to be playing. Then there were all these clips that were rehashes of scenes we already saw, like someone raided the editing room trash bin and scotch taped a bunch of them together and said ""Look! I made a BSG movie!"".

I think my problem with this was that it was mostly about the Cavil character- my least favorite of all the characters on this amazing series. Cavil is supposed to be this highly advanced cylon and he comes off as a snotty, backstabbing runt with deep early childhood trauma issues. It's a boring character without any depth, wisdom or redeeming qualities at all. At least Gaius was charming and conflicted while he was being selfish and arrogant. Cavil is like this stupid schoolyard bully who really doesn't have a ""plan"" at all except to be elected president of the cylon student council by killing all the humans and other cylons who won't vote for him.

For me it seemed like it skipped around from even to event, with Cavil lurking in the background or speaking one on one with another character in a dark room, making his plans that never seem to work out as well as intended.

A part of the depth is the real-world quality of not having all the questions answered. So the problem I have with ""The Plan"" is that the clarifications are unnecessary and indeed can diminish the impact of the original. Having said that, there are a few revelations that came as a true surprise. However, mostly the revelations just serve to diminish the series. Having said that, I of course still love the series.

Second, this is far better than the previous made-for-TV movie, ""Razor"" because it contains actual dramatic innovation and some truly great dialogue.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

Why the plan makes sense:
I liked the conceptualization of the plan not being fully coherent but actually makeshift. There is a tendency in most fiction to imply that the enemy is more capable of orchestrating and coordinating events to an almost inhuman level of preparedness. This is the kind of thinking that led to the persecutions of innocents during McCarthyism and the Red Scares of the 20th century as well as the present-day atmosphere of the War on Terror. The idea that the cylons were simply doing what they could to destroy the humans is all 'the plan' ever should have been. However, I wonder if even the notion that Cavil was behind every attack on Galactica might be too much. There is a certain amount of satisfaction in leaving certain mysteries, especially whether Ms. Godfrey is real or Head Six transformed, unexplained.

For this reason, sometimes the most dramatically fulfilling story elements are those both introduced in ""'The Plan""' and having no strong relation to events beyond it. Illustrating this fact is that we finally see the Number 4 cylon model (Simon) developed via two copies more fully than in the entire series to great effect.

Cavil:
For the most part, what lends ""'The Plan""' its power is the Number Ones and their struggle to see their plan come to fruition. For many of the episodes not written by Ronald D. Moore, who introduced the character in '""Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1',"" the Cavils were a shadow of what they were under his penmanship. Except for a brief scene written by Mark Verheiden in ""'Eye of Jupiter',"" the Cavils have remained as uninteresting as most of the cylon race in Seasons 3 and 4. They only came alive again in scenes specifically written by Moore in ""'No Exit""' and again in the finale. It''s a huge comfort to see that writer Jane Espenson is up to the task of reinvigorating the character in a way I had previously thought only Moore could. His every word and movement were a joy to watch, and it was the right decision to focus the story on his model; I just wish that there were even more of him. The ultimate explanation for the Cavils'' actions could have used more elaboration, but was thoroughly satisfying because it was psychologically rooted and, therefore, dramatically powerful.

What I particularly enjoyed about ""'The Plan""'' and what was the main driving mystery that viewers of the show had yet to uncover ' was how the Cavil who lived on Caprica came to see things differently than the Cavils (if they were any different) who would appear after '""Lay Down Your Burdens.'"" Rather than deplore humanity, the Cavil from Caprica delivered a message from the cylon race that it would stop pursuing the fleet and leave the survivors of the attack on the colonies alone. Until this story, it was unknown whether this Cavil was simply carrying out his orders or expressing something in which he truly believed. In this story, we learn, from the outset, that he had indeed internalized this message of peaceful coexistence, but what is left in the air until the end is how and why he came to this conclusion. Rather than being converted by some forced and sudden love of the humans ' which seems to happen somewhat implausibly to Ms. Godfrey ' Caprica Cavil is persuaded more by practicality. He is also forced to look into his psychological motivations more deeply than it is revealed the other Cavils, including the one on Galactica, have done. In this sense, Cavil's journey has an element of relatable realism to the human condition, as human history is full of self-delusion and denial or unawareness of psychological motivations, and that's what makes this story more a blessing than a curse to the overall story of Battlestar Galactica.

Visual presentation and directing:
Even on the more superficial terms of special effects, there is something beautiful in the first several minutes to how the cylon ships are shown moving into place and how the various colonial cities are depicted. Moreover, director Edward James Olmos has done a fantastic job of matching new scenes to a specific timeframe in the older footage from the series' past episodes. So, footage filmed several years apart flows seamlessly within a given scene.

The use of insurgency as plot device and political commentary:
I didn't much care for the insurgency storyline on Caprica because it failed to yield as much political commentary as 'Occupation'/'Precipice', which attempted to explore the causes for and issues involved in insurgency and collaboration across human history and into the present. I also tend not to enjoy action scenes much or that particular aspect of Anders' character, which was quite macho in Season 2. What I did like was the notion that Anders drew upon the idea for engaging in hit and run attacks from a movie. As is often the case on our culture, much of our knowledge of 'the other' is derived from popular culture and not academic works and, in times of crisis, we draw upon this entertainment for lessons on how to comprehend this 'other' and how to behave. The fact that the 'bad guys' in the film had used guerilla warfare and that humanity could, too, in resisting the cylons was, however slight, a moment of political insight. By referring to the reasons for terrorism in this way, the viewer is made to question whether this was necessarily a 'bad guy' approach at all ' as the US and Israel often hypocritically infer of their enemies' terrorist actions, while they use supposedly 'civilized' means of unjust laws and overwhelming force to kill hundreds of thousands more in more brutal and just as indiscriminate fashion.

Another great element was a comment on the nature of heroism that made me think about things in a whole new light. At one point, Anders tells Caprica Cavil that, once he began leading his team in fighting the cylons, he realized that it was much more difficult and terrifying than he had expected when he had rallied them to wage guerrilla warfare. He tells him that he instinctually wanted to run away -- to not live up to his battle cry rhetoric. However, what kept him forging ahead was that one of his team members would have seen him retreat and that he wanted to avoid the shame of abandoning the very task he had pushed them to undertake. In this light, he was driven more by a desire to protect his image than the kind of personal ambition for glory or doing the right thing by the human race. I've never seen this explanation for heroic acts expressed this way in fiction or history, but this was a very honest and realistic and human set of motivations and feelings that I could imagine myself experiencing. I absolutely love it when I learn something new about human nature.

Forced dramatic coherence:
One of the essential ingredients that the best of Battlestar Galactica has maintained in its storytelling is how random life is ' how unexpected. Yet it is difficult to craft engaging drama from complete randomness, so a balance between realism and coherence must be struck to give the program its power and often has been. While 'The Plan' didn't suffer from as much cute tidiness and forced dramatic coherence as '""Razor',"" it still had those problems of tilting too much toward coherence. The most egregious mistake was made in an effort to have an interesting dramatic moment between Chief Tyrol and Giana (played well by Lymari Nadal) upon their realization that Boomer and the Simon she loved had carried out their missions so poorly because of their love for the humans. While Tyrol and Giana were ashamed to be associated so intimately with cylons, they found comfort in their loved ones' 'humanity' because it meant that they weren't simply hateful of the human race; indeed, many of those cylons ' beyond those specific Number 8 and Number 4 copies ' are shown in this movie to be reluctant to execute their orders to hurt or put into disarray Galactica''s crew because of this fact.

This was a real addition to the program's storyline by making sense of mysterious story elements without taking away from the show's consistency. However, their bonding should have ended there. A mistake is made in overdoing the parallels between Tyrol and Giana by having her confess that she is not only suicidal over finding out her husband's identity, but has fantasized about killing herself by 'swan diving' from the upper section of the hangar bay. Through flashes, we are reminded that this is exactly what Tyrol had been dreaming about in ""'Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1'."" This is simply too convenient and completely unnecessary; while both characters might feel suicidal about their shame about loving cylons, it is highly unlikely they would think of committing suicide in the exact same way in the exact same place. Still, I enjoyed the tender way that Tyrol instinctually kissed her and especially the way they both understood that it was a lapse in judgment and how she consoled him as her comrade afterward.

Similarly, a wonderful bit of texture given to the Leoben character had his model obsessively begin to listen to Starbuck's chatter over the radio. However, this was taken a bit too far and made too self-consciously referential to things to come, when he paints a mandala similar to that Starbuck had painted as a child and when he even sees the same visions she would; an error was even made in having him see a vision of himself as the angel that simply took his form (and was not him) that would speak to Starbuck in ""'Maelstrom'.""

Over the top humor:
One upsetting aspect, which is a definite holdover from Jane Espenson's history of writing Joss Whedon-style humor on '""Buffy the Vampire Slayer',"" is the tendency to have over-the-top humor. In one scene, a Doral (Number Five) assumes that no one in the fleet will recognize him because he has a teal colored blazer unlike the red one worn by the Doral copy that was labeled a cylon by the humans in the miniseries. In another scene, an irritating version of Number 6 uses the word 'hum' as a sleazy and forced double entendre, which Joss Whedon shows do far too much. These kinds of attempts at humor lessen the show because the levity doesn''t arise naturally from a context that should respect both the tone of the scene and consistency of the characters (Doral isn''t that stupid) and lacks originality (I could see that oral sex joke coming a mile away).

Structural and pacing problems with the story:
There is a dramatic problem inherent in the structure of the story that seems insurmountable. In many instances, the story is not as gripping as it might be due to having to provide the viewers with context of events by employing footage from Season Two and especially Season One. The dramatic potency of the mostly excellent first and second season episodes is lost by only using portions of those scenes. However, it would have been far worse to use more of this footage because the narrative drag would have been even greater; on the other hand, I cannot imagine not using some means of reminding viewers which incident taking place in past episodes that given cylon activity relates.

Conclusion:
So, while this is a mixed bag, it is considerably more welcome than not as an addition to the series for humanizing the series, which I have always thought was a commentary on humanity's tendency to dehumanize (""They're not like us!"") and homogenize (""They're all the same!"") ""the other"", whomever that might be throughout human history and into the present. In doing so, the show has long demanded the audience to realize that, therefore, we - including our heroic leaders - are just as capable of kindness and cruelty as our adversaries.",1257465600,2,12170,4.819052178075634

A mishmash of a very few new scenes with the few available members of the great cast and with a boring script that hurt as much as clarified characters and plot lines from the series. I hated what it did to the original Boomer's story line. Less was much better in her case.
Nude scenes at best are silly, at worst distracting, gratuitous and insulting -- filmed for the prurient interest of the producers, directors and cast - definitely not for the viewers -- really a head scratcher.
Special effects are awesome in space wars and nuclear mass destruction. Only real quality aspect of this dvd.

Edward James Olmos needs to accept that the series is over -- the sets are gone, the writers and cast dispersed and  attempts to cut paste and bridge a meaningful story are fruitless. He didn't have the sets, writers or cast resources to do the franchise justice. This was obviously done on the cheap.

The best dramatic series in history is over. With all its imperfections, it was over at the end of the TV run. I just wish Olmos had accepted that before attempting this project. Once it was obvious the product  failed to live up to high franchise standard,. I wish he had had the wisdom to take the loss and just archive it somewhere.

3934961,3,B002HRF68A,"For starters, let's just say this film was made for the heavy-duty BSGphiles. I happen to be a BIG fan of BSG, but I recognise the faults so many are grousing about here, on ""The Plan"".

The feel is the same as we all know from watching the series, the SFX are the same, but it has the feel of a different POV. Sure, there are rehashed scenes from the series, but these are few, and are necessary to keep continuity of the ""new"" storyline. In many cases, you ARE treated to a different POV for all these scenes, be they sooo familiar.

I said from the start that this film was made for the hardcore BSG fans, as ""The Plan"" turns no new corners, opens no boxes, to expand the story, rather, it more closely examines the relationships between the Cylons and Man. Personally, I didn't need the extra detail, as the series pretty much laid out the basics, and let's face it, you gotta be pretty dumb to not absorb what was presented previously, even WITH the plot holes and dead-ends. I found ""Razor"", even with it's similar intent: to flesh out a particular plot developement, a bit much. Still, ""Razor"" outclasses ""The Plan"" by a good measure.

I found Edward J. Olmos' direction very nearly the same as the directors that helmed the series. An excellent job! Just so no one out there mistakes my intent, I enjoyed this film, just not to the extent that it requires more than a three-star rating. What transpired beyond the series that was originally aired, was a fun bit of ""how's the scene from here"". All in all, not bad.

The disc has some interesting special features for the Diehards, and the deleted scenes bring just a bit more detail, in case you didn't get enough from the film.",1257379200,,1686,4.446601941747573

New footage is merely there to bridge gaps between clips of old episodes. I loved the Caprica DVD and the regular series but this is just a shady way of getting more cash from old episodes.
Not worth the money. Not even close.",1257379200,6,537,4.223300970873787
3934963,2,B002HRF68A,"Let me state right off the bat that I was a HUGE fan of the recently-concluded ""Battlestar Galactica."" It was arguably the greatest sci-fi TV program ever made, if only because it was essentially one long, grand story arc that never really jumped the shark and came to a logical and reasonably satisfying conclusion. As for ""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" ...

THE GOOD: Some very cool special effects involving the Cylons nuking the colonial worlds. The tension is palpable as various Cylon vessels materialize in orbit and deploy some pretty serious thermonuclear weaponry. Some pretty well-rendered explosions, with imaginative cityscapes reduced to ruin. Unfortunately, all this takes place at the very beginning of the movie. After that, it's ...

NOT-SO-GOOD: Anyone looking forward to more Cylon backstory is going to be greatly disappointed. I suppose that's what the upcoming prequel series ""Caprica"" is going to explore, but even so, I was hoping for a little more detail about how the Cylons went about hatching their plan against the Colonies. Instead, the film begins less than one day before the Cylon attack.

As mentioned above, the attack itself is depicted pretty brilliantly. Sadly, it's the high point of the movie. After that, everyone is basically all dressed up with no place to go. We are left covering a lot of familiar territory, albeit from the Cylons' perspective. It's mostly just melodrama, with a little bit of sex, nudity, and violence thrown in for good measure. While a number of the main characters from BSG did not take an active role in this production, they do occasionally appear in what I can only assume are outtakes from the series.

In a nutshell, disappointing ... and certainly MUCH more so than the pilot for ""Caprica,"" which was released on DVD earlier this year. I thought the pilot for ""Caprica"" was pretty frakking wonderful, and I would highly recommend it. But ""BSG: The Plan,"" sadly, seemed more like a vanity project for Edward James Olmos than anything else.",1257379200,5,2014,5.020958083832335

No new information about the cylons and no discussion at all about their experiments with love and the ""farms"" back on Caprica.  I mean, that's what I want to know more about!  That's the piece of ""the plan"" that is intriguing.  The kill all humans piece was rather obvious.  Making the cylons aboard the Galactica look like bumbling idiots who couldn't do anything right only serves to diminish the perceived threat of the cylons throughout the first two seasons.  We're supposed to believe that the Galactica was literally overflowing with secret cylon agents for the first six months and they were incapable of doing anything significant?  Wasn't the real story that Cavil didn't want to destroy the Galactica because he preferred watching the final five suffer?  I'm pretty sure that's how they explained it in Season 4 but we get none of that in The Plan.

This is a cute side project but that's all.  I really enjoyed seeing more of the initial cylon attack on the colonies.  After that, however, I found myself getting rather bored.  Of all the episodes of the new BSG and Razor, this is the first time I've felt completely uninterested in what the writers had to say.

You can see the development of the civil war and the conflict even within the Cavil models. I found that interesting. I also liked the development of Simon, missed D'Anna, and thought that the explaination of why Sharon was flip-flopping between good and evil was interesting.

I won't be long-winded, either. Both me and my husband who is a luke-warm BSG fan liked this movie. Was it a classic? No, but it was better than an episode, too. Different, but that is what we come to expect from BSG, anyway. I want more!",1257292800,,1029,4.41578947368421

This tells us absolutely nothing new, nothing any viewer couldn't have worked out by themselves from watching what has gone before.

I have no idea why they called this ""The plan"" as it is overly evident there wasn't much of one at all, just a bunch of ever increasing inconsistencies and adhoc ideas which grew to such proportions as to be eventually unworkable - as evidenced in the decline of the writing in the final season. And now this botched attempt to try and superimpose a plan over all this.

All we come away with after watching this is that the cylons masterminded the destruction of 99% of the 12 colonies but due to ineptness couldn't finish off a decommissioned battlestar and defenceless rag tag fleet with their entire cylon fleet. Cavil apparently wiped the minds of the final 5 then 'supposedly' planned their escape of the genocide so they could witness how 'bad ' humanity are. The final 5's journey to get rescued and aboard the fleet was not planned but was merely at best - accidental. Without awareness of their former selves it never explains what lessons they were supposed to learn or when Cavil would make them aware of their former selves. So bearing this in mind - why did the Cylons try and destroy galactica week in week out? Does this make any sense? I suppose you just have to have a leap of blind faith and take it that everything that happened was ""the will of god"" =(deus et machina)=(cop out)= Make it up as you go along regardless.

SF fans who are also atheists should avoid this and the series at all costs as this series will irritate the hell out of you. Plot wise the series was highly contradictory.

The script is utterly inept and the direction pedestrian. I watched this just hoping things would improve - it didn't.

Save your money wait till this screens on TV/satellite. Olmos has said that this will make you want to re watch the whole series in a new light.

Thats what this is, a clip show. Only the editing of the events seem to change what happened so that Cavil knows the identity of the final 5 and so makes everyones visions meaningless, they have spare bodies for each of the 5 laying around in fact so obviously its no real secret.

The story jumps around way too much and there are so many copies I would have to take notes to make sure I knew who was who. The new characters were shallow, and many of the favorite characters like the president aren't even in this.

I wish they saved this material for a special edition boxed set of the seasons and added some of it back in as this would have kept a better continuity and story than this mish mash.

3934981,4,B002HRF68A,"There has been much criticism levelled at ""The Plan"". Much of it in my opinion is unwarranted.

One of the main complaints is that we never find out what the plan was. Well here is the plan - destroy the human race. Plain and simple. However the plan failed as Galatica and roughtly 50 000 survived the holocaust. The cyclons had no plan B so afterwards they chased the fleet down in an attempt to succeed in their plan A. And there you have it. I am not sure what other plan fans were expecting.

Another criticism is that this DVD is nothing but a glorified clip show. How untrue! Did it seem to jump from scene to scene? At times. But there was definitely a coherent structure to this story. Basically ""The Plan"" weaves its way through the original 2003 ministries and the first few epicodes of season one while filling in the blanks and explaining things that we didn't know.

But perhaps the best thing about ""The Plan"" is that is shows the utter destruction that the cyclons unleashed on the colonies of man. The footage of the nuclear warheads destroying cities, the ensuing panic, cyclon centurions walking from car to car and riddling the occupants with bullets, corpses littering the ground, etc was simply breathtaking. This was shown while a hybrid gives a play by play of the destruction. Absolutely chlling!

What could have been done differently? Well I would have liked to see moe of the cyclon society not just hours before the attack but in the years leading up to it. And It would have been great to see how the hybrids were made. Also there was no #3 cyclon (Lucy Lawless) in the story.

3934983,4,B002HRF68A,"""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" is sort of a recap and ""behind the scenes"" look at the Cylon thinking that went into the war against the humans. This straight to DVD movie uses a lot of footage from the series, but new scenes were added to expanded the plot with elements we learned later. A lot of new CG effects were also added, including showing more of the damage the first wave attacks caused to the colonies and the cities. There are a few scenes including nudity and sex, but it mostly is in good taste and used in the story telling.

The extras on the DVD include a few deleted scenes, a look at the special effects, additional insights into the Cylons, and a commentary option. Don't watch the extras without watching the movie first because there are a lot of spoilers.

Recommended for Battlestar Galactica fans, but only after watching all of the rest of the seasons.

3934984,4,B002HRF68A,"After reading many of the critical reviews here, and then viewing the movie, I was presently surprised.

Maintain an expectation that this is not going to compete with the series finale.  If you have watched the entire series, this is 2 hours of story telling that really helps to bring closure to the loose ends or unexplained events in the series.  The major down-side is that it reminds you that the series is over.

Solid story, some surprises, good acting, amazing special effects for at least the first act, but no real revelations like I was hoping for that would address some of the series finale open questions.  It could have been a great 2 or maybe even a 3 part episode.  Again, maintain the right expectations going into this.

I will also admit that I avoided reviews and anything else related to this because I didn't want it spoiled. So, I'll say it wasn't at all what I expected. What I did expect was like a prequel from the Cylons' point of view. Silly me.

A friend loaned this to me and I'm glad I didn't waste $20 on it. Did I like it? Yeah, it was okay. But it felt like ""deleted scenes"" with stuff we've seen before thrown in for cohesion. It really didn't add anything to the story for me. If you're looking for some big revelation, you'll be sorely disappointed in my humble opinion. I own the entire series and don't feel like this will add anything to the story, so I won't be investing my hard earned cash into it.

For the hard core fan, it may be a ""must have,"" but not for me. It was moderately entertaining so I don't feel like I wasted 2 hours. So, in my opinion, this is a rental but not something I'd buy.",1257033600,4,1035,4.093596059113301

And i have liked all of the spinoffs as well including the plan, as far as the story is concerned. But i am totally disappointed with the video aspect of the this blu-ray dvd and therein lies the problem. it is in fact defective and i think that instead of redoing the product the manufactures just slapped the keeping it true to the directors vision disclaimers. I tried two different blu-rays,including have them play it at the store so as to rule out my player, and then i gave up and just bought the regular format dvd, and any scenes that have a soft fuzz on the regular dvd are instead white snow on the blu-ray and is unwatchable, especially on the space scenes. why would i want to spend 30 bucks on a blu-ray, when the idea is for it to look clean and crisp. especially sci fi movies. Furthermore i have the first season in HD-DVD and it is done beautifully. so in closing get the regular format of the plan it is much better viewing than the blu-ray.",1257033600,2,1096,4.248803827751196
3934988,4,B002HRF68A,"There should be no surprise as to what The Plan is, much has been said about the concept and the plot all that needed to be done was see the final product.  For those that may not know The Plan is the story of what the Cylons intended the war between man and machine to be like and what it turned out to be instead.
Told primarily through the eyes of their leader or rather the Cylon manipulating events from the very begging, Number One better known as Brother Cavil.
The Plan is essential viewing since it tells a story we are familiar with yet from the Cylons perspective and it shows you how the best laid plans, even those of machines are not perfect.
Even with a master manipulator such as Brother Cavil at the helm things did not go as planned even as the first bombs dropped.
The special effects are at least as good as some of the best episodes I've seen on BSG and the integration of new and old scenes are seamless and absolutely done appropriately.  The composition does not distract from the overall experience.
There are even a few BSG surprise moments, in the fashion we are accustomed to.  I was truly happy with my purchase and it sits comfortably with the rest of the series.
When I view the series I cannot fathom watching it without this story added. Since it explains so much and gives us a look and a perspective into a world that we only visited briefly from time to time on some of the series episodes.
Of special note, I was impressed on how the movie was able to tell the story it needed to tell and still manage to give us a fresh look at characters that in some cases never received the attention they deserved and in other cases probably would never have received any attention other than a few lines.
The writing, the production values and the series as a whole never cease to amaze me. If you are a BSG fan you can purchase without worry, Ron Moore and company have taken care of their fans yet again.

3934990,2,B002HRF68A,"Three Good Reasons To Watch ""The Plan"" Last

1. Compared to the BSG miniseries/pilot, the subsequent series, the `tween-season webisodes, Razor, and the pilot for Caprica, all of which I'd recommend to anyone,  The Plan is, so far, the weakest element in the BSG franchise.

2. If you are a seasoned fan you're not going to see much that's new or revelatory.  There won't be many major ""a-ha"" moments that many of us were expecting.  In fact I don't think there is anything new revealed that couldn't have been included in the original series - that would have significantly diluted any of the mysteries or conflicts of the story arc.

Moreover I would guess that 75% of the scenes were simply repurposed footage from the original series.

3. If you're brand new to BSG you will more likely be confused than entertained or intrigued.

First, there are inexplicable continuity errors. For instance, in one scene Sharon Valerii is shown walking through the corridors of Galactica  in shackles when her fate intersects with an angry grief stricken Kelly. You know what happened next.  Two scenes later you see Valerii, in uniform and armed, as part of a rescue team on Caprica. With no explanation of how she got from one scene to the next.

Second, while it was clear that ""there are 13 models and many copies""  the plethora of copies running around at different locales at the same time must have been confusing.  By my count, at one point, I think there were three Sixes, two Ones, and at least two Fives all operating contiguously.  .

Finally, that there was a major spoiler in the first 15 minutes. The identify of the last of the Final Five was revealed.  I'm not sure if this was confusing to new viewers, but I found it shocking.  So did a couple of friends who'd only made it half way through Season  Four on DVD -  which was  before the identity  of the final Cylon had been made clear.  Ouch.

I'm a big  BSG's fan but  The Plan was far from their finest hour (or two.)  It just wasn't up to snuff.

Would I recommend it to anyone?  Maybe to someone who'd the series three of four times already who was desperate for a new  BSG fix  (even if it meant the fix  wasn't particularly original or satisfying.)",1257033600,,2213,4.540609137055838
3934991,1,B002HRF68A,"How could they follow up one of the greatest Series ever to come out on television with such a poor put together disgrace of a film.

It is an atrocity and a slap in the face to the fans. The new scenes were just horrible. The special effects must have been done by someone else as they stuck out like a sore thumb.

Do yourself a favor and wait till it comes on Sy-Fi before purchasing this. I really wish I hadn't seen it as it really ruins a television show that was so great but having this as the last ""new"" BSG to be released.

And for whatever reason, because it did absolutely nothing to further the story, the creators decided tho throw in a few gratuitous nude shots of women, and even a quick zoom on one guy's appendages, just because they could I suppose.
As far as the story goes, there was nothing to be learned here. It was completely predictable, except for the parts where Cavil gets to ""get it on"" with the younger hotties. I did NOT need to see that.
If you're a huge fan of Dean Stockwell and thought he needed more exposure in the series, they more than make up for it here. But if you're looking for a good solidly entertaining BSG fix... good luck.",1257033600,3,840,4.356687898089172

Yeah, as if we hadn't known. Very minor aspects are revealed here, the story is thick and slow, and if you haven't seen the series, you sit and wonder what the hell happens.

There was also several other gratuitous naked breast and butt shots so hide the kids eyes. Cylon No. 1 Cavil was the big star and not very big at that.

3934997,5,B002HRF68A,"The Cylons have a plan... We'd heard and seen that concept a lot through the run of the spectacular TV series Battlestar Galactica. We didn't know what the plan was, really, beyond nuking the Colonies and eventually destroying humanity, but we assumed it was a pretty darn interesting plan!

Battlestar Galactica: The Plan, the latest direct-to-DVD release from the SyFy Channel, shows us exactly what the plan was, and, as it turns out, it was... er... basically to nuke the Colonies and wipe out humanity. Everything else that happend was largely them reacting to the fact that there were still human remnants out there.

The movie tells the story of the Cylon attack on the Colonies (and shows it in loving detail), and also tells us some of exactly what the Cylons were doing within the Fleet and on Caprica back during the early days of the series. You see how Cavil controlled Boomer, what Simon was up to both in the Fleet and on Caprica, you see how Anders and his crew ended up fighting as a resistance group and you really get an idea of how much of a puppet-master Cavil was.

You'll see all the main characters on the show, though many of them just through re-used footage. You won't see Lucy Lawless' Cylon character, but you do see all the others, including a wonderful shot with two Cavils seeing the Final Five all standing together.

You'll also see a lot more nudity than you might expect, including at least one gratuitious penis shot, and several breasts. You'll also see Edward James Olmos' wife in the all-together and you'll even see the upper half of the face of the long-missing Boxey.

Extras on the DVD include deleted scenes, some behind the scenes stuff, a trailer for Caprica (which if you haven't yet seen, why not?), and a commentary by Edward James Olmos (who directed the movie), and Jane Espenson (who wrote it).

Ultimately this is an excellent, if somewhat lacking, movie. I would've liked to have seen them do this as a four-hour film rather than two, because it would've been nice to carry it all the way to the end of the series. But that's ok. For what is likely to be the last of the re-imagined BSG, it's pretty good and I'm happy with it!",1256947200,2,2182,4.582051282051282
3934998,3,B002HRF68A,"The Plan is a TV movie that goes right back to the Battlestar Galactica mini-series and then revisits key moments from the first two seasons through the eyes of the Cylons. Along the way, it attempts to resolve several key problems with the series, notably a few major plot holes left gaping and to give a lot more screen time and character development to Rick Worthy's character, Simon, arguably the least-developed Cylon role. In this movie we learn that there was a Simon model in the fleet after all and what he was doing, and discover that this Cylon was married with a step-daughter. This also allows the return of Edward James Olmos' real-life wife Lymari Nadal as Giana, one of the refugees from Caprica that Boomer rescued in the pilot, and a revelation about the ultimate fate of her character.

To some degree, these are small-fry questions, however, with bigger questions like how Boomer's sleeper programming worked, who the unknown person Caprica-Six was meeting on Caprica during the mini-series was and what was going on with Shelly Godfrey and her attempt to manipulate Baltar being more thoroughly explored. In some cases the answers are interesting, but in other cases not really that necessary, with fans long ago coming up with decent answers.

Overall, especially in the first half, the exercise feels like an excuse to show off some excellent CGI (and some rather ropier effects as well, including one terrible shot that makes Caprica look like it's about three miles across) but mainly to fill in some plot holes only obsessive nitpicking fans worry about. In the second half, however, a more interesting story emerges. Essentially A Tale of Two Cavils, in the second half the experiences of Galactica Cavil and Caprica Cavil are contrasted and explored in a decent manner, with Simon's situation and Anders' rise from being a sports jock to a military leader unfolding as decent subplots. These elements are tied together with some great writing and some excellent acting (especially from Dean Stockwell as Cavil, who comes across as calculating, intelligent and utterly ruthless, even moreso than he did in the series). The storylines also have a great conclusion when Caprica Cavil is rescued along with the rest of Anders' rebel group and meets up with his fellow model number in Galactica's brig and airlock where they discuss their conclusions, which are very different.

Whilst that thematic structure works well, the 'unrated' version of the DVD/Blu-Ray makes rather gratuitous use of its freedom to depict sex and nudity, most notably a rather incongruous Galactica crash-zoom on a nude pilot in the locker room. I suppose if you are going to include nudity, doing so for both sexes is fair, but none of it adds anything to the plot and looks completely out of keeping with the rest of the series.

Battlestar Galactica: The Plan (***) is the series' swansong and on that note is altogether stronger than the actual series finale itself. However, whilst the movie eventually gets it together and has a solid second half, the first half is all over the place, story and effects-wise, and takes probably too long to cut to the chase. Still, an interesting addition to the series. It is available now on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States. A UK release has not yet been confirmed (although a region-free UK import of the Blu-Ray is available). An edited version of the movie will air on SyFy in the United States and Sky One in the UK some time in 2010.",1256947200,4,3485,4.871838111298482
3934999,2,B002HRF68A,"The motivation for telling the Cylon side of the story WAS a compelling idea and granted I earnestly waited for this to come out with high expectations. Actually I was really jonesing for any new BSG.  HOWEVER, Like others have wrote, this feels like a bonus video of deleted scenes more than an actual new plot.  It offered nothing new of any significance.  I felt like this was really about ""ok, let's let Eddie make a movie now"" and it did not do the series or the fans that were captivated by its writing ingenuity any justice. For the first time I felt as it the studio/producers were milking the franchise (a la Lucas) and I regret buying before watching.  As I said, I had high expectations and shouldn't have expected anything less especially with all the hype and waiting, but here you have it!  At least Dexter is on point this season 4, which hardly if ever disappoints and gives me something to look fwd to as BSG once did... I think they understand the intellect of its fan base and wouldn't compromise like ""The Plan"" did. To those who loved this, I really am a fan also, but let's be honest now.",1256947200,9,1110,4.421568627450981
3935000,3,B002HRF68A,"I expected a lot out of The Plan, after the spectacular series that BSG was. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by it because it had such high standards to maintain. Let me say this off the bat: Bear McCreary's score was awesome, as always, and the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie were amazing, even gut-wrenching. But it all went downhill fast. I felt like I was watching something like the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, Trials and Tribble-ations, where the crew goes back in time and lurks on the edges of the Original Series episode ""The Trouble With Tribbles"". Hey, we can hear Kirk and Spock talking about tribbles! Sisko is throwing tribbles from the storage bin down on Kirk's head! Same thing here. Chunks of dialogue and footage from the series are interposed on new footage of the Cylons which is supposed to explain what they're doing, and why. Hey, wow, we can hear Starbuck and Anders! Leoben is listening to Starbuck on the radio! It could have been clever, but instead it ended up seeming stilted and forced. It seemed that maybe only 40% of the film was new footage and the rest was old clips.

There were plenty of plotlines that went nowhere. How Cavil came to rescue Ellen and Tori wasn't completely explained - where did the ambulance Raptors come from? - nor was it explained why it was so important for Cavil to assemble the Final Five in one place. And Three, through whose eyes we first knew of the Final Five, was completely missing from this story. And why was Leoben such a mystic? What connection does he have to the same eternal threat that Kara does? Nothing. Instead we get a short clip of Leoben finger-painting, followed by a clip of Leoben thinking about future events just before being airlocked by Roslin (who, incidentally, was completely absent from The Plan, even in flashback footage).

I think the problem with The Plan is that it tried to tell a new story within the context of a tale that had already been told, whereas Razor told an entirely new story in a new context. After Razor, I felt like I could relate to why Admiral Cain became what she did. After the first 15 minutes, the only thing The Plan did was convince me that Cavil is indeed a ""petulant little child"" and that the Cylons weren't evil, just highly annoying.  In fact, a friend of mine cracked a joke: The Plan can be summed up in this sentence - ""The Cylons got mopey so they blew stuff up.""

A word about the skin that everyone's complaining about: get over it. Seriously. There weren't more than 5 seconds of boobies in the entire film. Do you really think that a society which is OK with a flag officer having a same-sex relationship would really give a damn about nudity in a strip club and in a co-ed shower? I found more disturbing the somewhat graphic sex scene between Simon and Giana, played by Lymari Nidal - Edward James Olmos's wife, in a film that Olmos himself directed.

If this is truly it for BSG, and it appears to be, then The Plan was a disappointing ending to one of the best series on television. It had quite a bit of potential, but it failed to meet that potential. Sadly, Jane Espenson's story was less a screenplay than a it was a series of vignettes lacking a coherent narrative until the very end.",1256860800,7,3246,4.494915254237288

3935002,5,B002HRF68A,"Many of the criticisms of ""The Plan"" here don't make sense to me. If you liked the new ""Battlestar Galactica,"" then you will like ""The Plan."" If, on the other hand, you were let down by the series finale because it didn't match whatever expectations you had about it, and you're hoping that ""The Plan"" will resolve whatever lingering dissatisfaction you have with the series, then you will probably be disappointed. I found ""The Plan"" to be absolutely as worthy as many of the best moments of the series, and even better than the other BSG film, ""Razor"" (which I also liked, but not as much as this). ""The Plan"" has great characterization, writing, acting, depth, humor, and special effects. The depiction of the destruction of the colonies at the opening ranks among the best battle scenes of the whole series. And if, like me, you're a Dean Stockwell (Cavil) fan, then you'll get a real treat with this film, since he is the main character(s), and he finally gets the room to develop Cavil into a fully-fledged personality, something which never quite happened in the series. Also, it puts a coda on the underlying meaning of the conflict between Cylons and humanity, and why the conflict became more and more convoluted as the series developed. For those who say that this is nothing but clips from the series, that is blatantly false: there are a few clips included for context, but 90% of the film is original material and even some of the material that was taken from the series seems to be recreated or else taken from different versions of the same shots (there are minor dialogue variations, for instance). And as for the nudity, it occurs in two, brief scenes and is not gratuitous at all - in fact, in the scene set aboard Galactica, it merely makes explicit something that was often implied in the series but could never be shown due to TV censorship. Again, if you stuck with BSG all the way through to the end, then you need to see ""The Plan.""",1256860800,3,1957,4.610315186246418
3935003,5,B002HRF68A,"The cylons were created by man. They rebelled and evolved to appear human and even think as humans. These robotic machines in the universe of Battlestar Galactica destroyed an entire civilization of fictional humans in a quest to right the wrongs of their creators' sins. The moral question of justice has always been a backdrop of Battlestar, but The Plan really brings it to the forefront. What reasoning is there for genocide and mass destruction? What moral imperative drives devastating loss of life? Such are the massive questions the show endeavors to resolve, or at least, question. The Plan examines what it means to be human.

In the Battlestar universe, the cylons have always had a plan. We just never got to see or understand it as viewers. The Plan examines pinnacle moments during the Battlestar show and present clips of the events with supplemental scenes to further extrapolate details about the characters. The destruction of the colonies is witnessed first hand by several members of the Final Five cylons who provided the technology for human emulation, one of the critical innovations the cylons made to infiltrate humanity once and for all. Sweeping shots of glistening cities are replaced with apocalyptic images of mindless destruction through waves of nuclear air strikes. The effects are mesmerizing on a visual and intellectual level, as the viewer is left to ponder the massive outcome of military damage to defenseless civilian targets. The emotional impact is overwhelming.

The cylon plan for human genocide derives from the conniving plans of Cavil, labeled One as a cylon model. Dean Stockwell provides a provocative characterization of a somewhat schizophrenic character. He ""chews the scenery"" a bit as the evil mastermind, but Stockwell emanates his decisions with such moral clarity, such disdain for opposing sides, that he fills the megalomaniac shoes very well. The performance is simultaneously campy and brilliant in his provoking mannerisms. Mixing the personal with the theatrical, he conveys a sensational villain with insistent motives that question our understanding of human morality.

The DVD is chock full of extras, from extended deleted scenes with accompanying soundtrack to special extras which offer insight into the BSG creative process. The special effects team has a feature offering some understanding into the complex creative enterprise of realizing the detailed and realistic visual effects of the series. Edward James Olmos has a feature describing his transition to director and what the process means to him. The extra content enhances the understanding of the creative process and provides additional storylines through the deleted scenes, making for a cornucopia of juicy material.

Most of all, The Plan provides a means of observing our moral universe and the underlying philosophical principles of our existence. Battlestar Galactica has always focused on moral conflicts, and this most recent movie expounds upon Ronald D. Moore's vision as well as human morality. It is a triumph of creative television and moral exploration.

Highs: Exemplary special effects nicely complement a compelling storyline; Dean Stockwell's scenery-chewing brilliance; poetic direction by Olmos; casual confidence of Espenson's dialogue; exciting DVD extras; innovative re-imagining of the clip show.

Lows: Somewhat campy; Cylon evil-ness reduced occasionally to comic slapstick (see Six's wig switch in the middle of the movie).

The Verdict: A, Haunting, nostalgic presentation of the war between man and cylon.",1256860800,3,3565,5.470909090909091
3935004,4,B002HRF68A,"Okay, if you buy this expecting big battle scenes, the answer to who is the cylon god, a full discussion of cylon religion/philosophy, an explanation of what the mental-Six and mental-Baltar were or an explanation of the intricacies of the grand cylon plan, then you will be disappointed.

However, if you appreciate the kind of character development and the intricacies of internal motivation and conflict that make BSG the TV landmark that it is, than you have struck gold.

We witness the unraveling, frustration and conflicts that arise as the cylons are forced to confront their humanity and their feeling of connections both to humans and each other. We see the cylons as conflicted, irritated, frustrated, noble and even incompetent on occasion.

Most of all we see Dean Stockwell, stepping up in his role as two separate cylons, each evolving into significantly different roles.

Perhaps the most interesting thing is the revelation that the One's seemed to be in charge until the war began, a role that they eventually lose.

So if you're up for a movie-length character study that will enhance your appreciation of the series, this is for you. However, if you are looking for action, or a stand-alone movie experience this isn't it.

In short, insiders will love this, but this is not the experience to use to introduce someone to the new BSG.",1256860800,37,1353,4.938325991189427
3935005,4,B002HRF68A,"If you are a dedicated (current era) Battlestar Galactica fan, I think you are going to enjoy ""BSG:The Plan."" Is it perfect? No. But it's quite good.

BEWARE--some spoilers are sprinkled throughout this review.

If you like Dean Stockwell as Brother Cavil (or Cylon #1), you'll like ""The Plan."" He's the main character(s). He's acerbic, witty, devious, murderous, etc. In short, all the reasons why he's my favorite Cylon. All the Cylons, except for Lucy Lawless, are in the film and most of the original Cylons play multiple roles. Most of the Human cast only appears, like Lucy Lawless, in stock footage from the series--other than Edward James Olmos, who directed the film. They give Simon the Cylon much more to do in the film than he ever did on the show, except in that one season two episode ""The Farm.""

The Plan takes place both before and after the 12 colonies are wiped out. Half the story takes place on Caprica, with Sam Anders and the resistance, and the other half takes place with the infiltrating Cylons among the fleet. But ""The Plan"" ends before settlement on New Caprica at the end of season two.

Normally, I don't care for the all too prevalent sci-fi gimmick of re-telling ""behind the scenes"" stories that parallel a work of good fiction, whether written or filmed. In this case, the BSG folk are telling us stuff that makes good sense (for the most part) and adds to, rather than distracting from, the series as a whole. Some of it is a bit silly--like how Shelly Godfrey (Six) evades capture after trying to discredit Baltar. Some of it is tragic--like Boomer wrestling with her ""humanity.""

Could ""The Plan"" have covered more ground? Absolutely. One place they fall short is in the aftermath of the episode Anders spent with the ""war hero"" Cylons on Caprica near the end of season 2. Some of that is covered in the deleted scenes, however.

One thing I was expecting and didn't get was some sort of closure about Starbuck. Or at least some small bit of information more than what we have already. No dice. So we still don't know if she was an ""angel"" or a Cylon or the daughter of a Cylon, etc.

Since in some of the promotional materials I've seen, executive producer Ron Moore blames and berates executive producer David Eick for coming up with the line about the Cylons having a ""plan"" shown in the opening montage each week, and he says he'll never forgive him for it because it was so cheesy. So you can tell both of them didn't really have a plan either. And, as it turns out, neither did the Cylons.

The ""plan"" of the Cylons was to destroy humanity, by any means necessary--which was rather obvious all along. But the lack of a capital P ""plan"" doesn't really detract from the story. And Cavil always has a plan. Or several. Yet what puzzled me was there was no overt mention of the Cylon's human-Cylon breeding program, which seemed to be an important ""plan"" to them at one point in the show, until Hera's birth.

If you want a spoiler, here it is. Despite Lucy Lawless seeming to be in charge of the Cylons as D'Anna (or Cylon #3) in the series, Cavil is the puppet master behind the destruction of humanity. And he was responsible for most of the Cylon plots that bedeviled the fleet in the first two seasons of BSG. Given his character, I found this totally believable. And having no Lucy Lawless around for this new film made it that much easier for Cavil to shine. Cavil could definitely give the nefarious Ben from ""Lost"" a run for his money.",1256860800,,3483,4.55111821086262
3935006,1,B002HRF68A,"The Plan...long anticipated for it's promise of providing some answers to questions left over from the series.

So what was the grand ""Plan"" often mentioned in each episodes sign on?
""Kill all the humans""
DUH!
So that was Cavil's grand plan? I had kind of guessed that after the mini-series. So the plan fails when a fleet of humans escape and the rest of the show is Cavil bumbling around trying to finish the job, and still failing. Then Caprica Cavil shows up, and tells Fleet Cavil they were wrong because they forgot to factor in ""love"" and the show ends.

And I just wasted 20 dollars to learn what I already knew at the beginning of the whole mess. They promised that the end would be so mind blowing that it would make you re-think the entire series and be forced to re-watch it from the start with your newly unveiled eyes. They (the writers) failed.

So lets make a 2 hour time sink and blame it all on Cavil!!!",1256860800,6,921,4.374269005847953

I have seen every second of BSG footage from every season, web episode, interviews, deleted scenes and such. This movie really did nothing to add to the series. I think the ending was very appropriate and this almost tarnishes it. Most of the actors did not come back, it was a lot of flashbacks. It did explain a thing or two, but nothing that was truly critical to the series. Why not answer the question of What Kara was rather than Why Sharon was all wet? What about head Baltar and Head Six? There were just so many left open questions I'd rather have answered if they were going to bother. It's a good watch, and it does make me want to re-watch all the series - only to remind myself why I liked it to begin with.",1256774400,2,804,4.193548387096774
3935008,5,B002HRF68A,I really enjoyed the show and the new point of view. There isn't much room for a series here but as a one time thing it was great. I borrowed it but enjoyed it enough to buy the dvd. One way to encourage good quality entertainment is to throw a few bucks into it.,1256774400,3,263,3.888888888888889
3935009,2,B002HRF68A,"When The Plan was first announced it was billed as  being the BSG series from the Cylon point of view. The SciFi (pardon me,SyFy) network did a good job of wetting the fans appetites. It was going to be cool, it was going to be awesome. We were finally going to see things from a different perspective. We were going to learn what the plan was all about.
What a let down the finished movies turned out to be. The perspective of the Cylons is nothing more than rehashed moments from the series. At times it appeared that scenes were taken from the series and edited into the movie. There were some new elements added into the movie ( a cylon with a family. co-ed showers), but nothing compared to what made the series interesting and fun to watch. And what about the plan? Turns out that the plan was the destruction of the human race. Wow, what a revelation. Of course I am being sarcastic. We knew that the Cylons wanted to destroy the human race from the very first episode.
What the movie needs to be billed as is a two hour recap of the series. Let's be honest. That is all this movie is- a two hour recap. I saw the series. It was incredible and imaginative. Most episodes I can remember quite well. I don't need a reminder. Some die hard fans are going to scream the praises of The Plan. However, if you are open minded and look criticaly at the movie you see that there is very little that is praise worthy in the movie.
I am glad that I rented the movie before buying it. I won't be adding this to my BSG seasons.

[...]",1256774400,3,1528,4.22945205479452
3935010,5,B002HRF68A,"I started watching The Plan really skeptical; I read all the reviews here, and thought it was going to be mediocre at best, as all the negative reviews seem to be saying that in unison.

However, I was really pleasantly surprised. I can understand how some people might be disappointed with The Plan, it doesn't, after all, answer some of the questions left hanging in the air after the series finale. It doesn't have the space battles or insane intensity of some of BSG's better episodes. It doesn't include some of the most important characters (Laura Roslin, Apollo, Starbuck).

But The Plan was never planned or written, I think, as a nostalgia film that is supposed to exploit our feelings for these characters to milk us for some cash. Instead, it has decided to do something bold: to tell an entirely new story that connects with what we already know, happening at the same time as what we've seen during the first two seasons of BSG.

It's the story of how the Cylons, each in different situations and living amongst different humans were in fact influenced by those humans. We see them developing genuine empathy, and utter hate. We see some renouncing their Cylon identity because of what they've done. We see them questioning their actions. We see them at their most brilliant, but also at their most incompetent. We see them for what they truly are: the imperfect creations of imperfect creations. In the end, the moral is simple: it's easy to kill someone from space with a nuke. It's hard to kill someone looking them in the eye.

If your going to watch The Plan expecting some grand revelations about the loose ends in the series finale, then you will come out disappointed. But if you watch The Plan looking for a really well written movie, with some terrific performances, some new insights into Cylon thinking, or just for a little nostalgia, you won't be disappointed.

So, if you choose to buy this DVD, judge it on it's own merits.",1256774400,299,1952,4.695906432748538
3935011,3,B002HRF68A,"This concept had a ton of potential; the destruction of the colonies from the cylon point of view.  The opening scenes of destruction are pretty good and the story starts out ok but quickly loses its direction.  If I thought that was the point I would be more inclined to rave about it.

This gave us no new insights into the destruction of the colonies or really the motivation behind the destruction other than blind hatred.  We learn nothing new about the cylons nor do they make(outside of a really interesting Number 4)their characterization any deeper.  It would have been interesting to so some of the handringging and emotional discussion about the cylons decision to leave the colonies after the destruction.  Instead we are treated to a group of scenes that are neat to watch and fun for a BSG fan.

Director Olmos stated that after watching this you are going to want to watch the whole series; but the movie did nothing to change my view of the early episodes.  There were no ""oh"" moments and no additional layers added to previous stories.  For example when I found out about the final five all the previous episodes and their roles were completely changed and I enjoyed rewatching them for the irony.  This supplies no additional layers.

Despite all of the above if you enjoyed BSG and don't expect too much this movie is worth the two hours to watch.  It is worth a buy to make a BSG collection complete.  This is not necessarily the worst episode but it is in the bottom 1/3.  What keeps it out of the bottom is the performance of Dean Stockwell which, given the material, was excellent.  The MVP award however goes to Rick Worthy who does an amazing job and whose story line gives a peek of what this movie could have possibly achieved.",1256774400,3,1754,4.576923076923077
3935012,1,B002HRF68A,"Although it shows an interesting perspective regarding a couple points--such as that the original goal being the recovery of the Final Five, and the Four's storyline and the discussion between Four's widow and Chief Tyrol--I would not recommend it.  It seems like only 60% new material, and the rest is like a summary documentary to show you what happened in the first 2 seasons.  It's not worth the money, and the nudity is completely pointless.  Razor was also ""not rated"", but it was clean.  But with the direction Edward James Olmos is taking on Caprica and The Plan, there's a certain expectation you should have about buying straight-to-DVD BSG movies.  If a movie is made for SciFi channel or for the theaters, then it might be ok.  But this is not something you can watch with your family.",1256774400,5,797,4.739130434782608
3935013,3,B002HRF68A,"When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get a few answers to the questions that were not answered during the 4+ seasons of BSG.  I was hoping that the reveal of the Cylon ""Plan"" in it's entirety would explain the plot threads that were not tied up.  I really wanted to know what happened to Kara Thrace when she was captured and held at the farm?  What were they doing to her?

But what I got from this movie was a flashback to life on Caprica and in the colonies before the Cylon attack and a bunch of new ""never before seen, deleted scenes"" added to original, season 1-4+, footage to fill in the pieces of what Cavil, Simon, and Anders for the most part experienced off screen .  I never got the feeling of a continuous story that made this final movie worthwhile.

If you're a BSG fan and a completest you have to watch this, but otherwise you can skip this and be just as happy.",1256774400,32,884,4.170588235294118
3935014,2,B002HRF68A,I watched this and of course i have seen every episode so watching this was upsetting. they add a few new clips but nothing in the movie was worth the movie. its all seemed like things they could have used for deleted scenes. it ddoesn't explain much its mostly about the cavil and him throwing a fit. if u could rent it i would don't waste your money.,1256774400,,352,4.1911764705882355
3935015,4,B002HRF68A,"For BSG fans, the opening always referred to the Cylons having a plan for about three seasons and then they didn't. When the series ended, The Plan was left hanging out there for us to ponder (or for others to drive them to madness). So, this movie is the writers' answer to that burning question.
The Plan does not stand alone. You cannot watch this without prior knowledge of the events in the series (and why would you want to?). In fact, I would say that you need a good understanding of what happened in each episode they reference to make The Plan satsifying. Otherwise, you will be left scratching your head.
The Plan is structured as a series of vignettes primarily connected by the presence of Model One (Brother Cavil). At some points it takes a part of an episode and extends it a beat to reveal what the Cylons were doing at that moment and time. At other points it introduces new stories to explain why Cylons did what they did. So, you are not watching a linear story but jumping from point to point within the series. This makes The Plan feel disjointed at times because there really is no reason they move from one scene to the next.
What makes the Plan great is that it shows why the Cylons plan failed. There were times during the series that I could not believe the humans got anyway. But after watching the Plan, I can see that the Cylons were not always sure about what they were doing. This might frustrate some fans of the show but I think it makes the Cylons more realistic and complex like the real enemies we face in the modern world. Their motives changed over time as they were left to deal with the consequences of their actions.
I felt the main theme of The Plan was to show that the Cylons were still only children unable to handle the world they were born into. They loved and hated their creators at the same time a contradiction they could never resolve in their minds. And the presence of creators in their universe made it impossible for the Cylons to find their own path. It was something that was dealt with at the end of the series but was shown in detail in The Plan. I enjoyed looking back at the series from another point of view and while it was a little disconcerting at times, I caught myself saying ""Oh, that's why that happened!"" more often and being satsified with the answer.
The Blu-Ray version looks great. The outer space shots look terrific but cityscape seem a little fake with their overly clean appearance. We did find a great Easter Egg but we didn't really delve into the special features.
I will definitely watch this again and then watch whole series with the new insight I have. I am sure I will enjoy the show even more now.",1256774400,,2686,4.406438631790745
3935016,3,B002HRF68A,"If you are already a BSG fan and episode follower you will know exactly what's going on and be able to appreciate how ""The Plan"" fills in the gaps and shows what what was happening on the Cylon side of the war up to rescue of Sam Anders and his band of Rebels from Earth.

On the other hand, if you have not seen at least the Mini-Series and the first few episodes of Season One then will not understand this film and think it has no plot. The scenes jump around from Caprica to BSG with no satisfactory explanation of who the Cylon's are and why the same ones keep popping up in so many places. Even I, who own all DVD's except Season's 3.5 and 4.5, was scratching my head at the Mother/Father references and was totally floored to discover that Ellen Tye was one of the Final Five. Yeah, something was said about them being the original creators, but since I hadn't seen the second half of Season Four or the final episode I didn't know what he was talking about at all.",1256774400,,972,4.225806451612903
3935017,5,B002HRF68A,"I didn't know what to expect when I heard about this movie. Being a huge fan of the show I was somewhat worried because I never really felt that Battlestar Galactica: Razor was a great fit for the show. However The Plan is no Razor.

The Plan is a far more detailed look at show then one would expect. It shows a lot of details that were overlooked on the show and answers a score of questions about what the cylons were up to. Without getting into any details, it will make you go back and rewatch seasons one and two and truly understand what horrors humanity was up against! I'd recommend this as a must have for any fan of the show! It was outstanding and I hope we see more movies like this in the future featuring the Galactica and her crew.",1256774400,4,747,4.1875
3935018,3,B002HRF68A,"Well, I watched ""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" last night and I have to say it wasn't the best BSG I've ever seen but its not without its good points either. It seems to be stitched together bits of new material along with some older stuff (some we've seen before and some we haven't). Cavil is the main character of this piece and rather than actually focusing on the Cylon's plan for humanity's destruction it really seems to be reiterating the one fatal flaw within the plan: the concept of 'love'. Cavil is thwarted all along the way simply because he cannot comprehend the ideas of love, friendship and fidelity. He seems to be lacking these qualities that all the other 'skin jobs' seem to possess to some degree and his struggle to understand it is sometimes funny, sad and down right scary at times. If the script hadn't been so choppy (which is surprising since it is written by Jane Espenson who has done some otherwise excellent work on this show as well as ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") this could have been a fine addition to the BSG saga.  I strongly suspect that the Scy Fy Channel or whoever didn't want to foot the bill for a feature film with an all new story and consequently forced Espenson and Edward James Olmos (the director) to put something together based largely on previously existing material.  If that's the case then I still have to award kudos to those two for creating something at least half way interesting.

Bottom Line:  If you are new to ""Battlestar Galactica"" DO NOT start here; instead get the Season One box set and begin the epic journey of this fabulous sci-fi series there.  If you are already a die hard BSG fan I think you will find some very rewarding material here as long as you keep your expectations low.

P.S.  The Blu Ray image looks wonderful and I had no complaints in that department.  I haven't had time to check out the extras yet but there are the usual commentaries from director and script writer, deleted scenes and a few featurettes.",1256774400,6,1995,4.584269662921348
3935019,5,B002HRF68A,"While definitely not a stand-alone piece like Razor, The Plan is definitely recommended for BSG fans. Many of the things going for it make it easily criticized, but if you consider what you know after watching The Plan and what you didn't know before watching it, some of those criticisms start to become significantly less extreme.

For example, many reviewers criticize this movie for its arguably excessive use of stock footage from the TV show. While there were definitely times that the footage in the movie looked familiar, I quickly found myself realizing that the scene was evolving into something new and not in a previous season. What I mean to say by this is that the new footage is almost woven in too well to the old footage; in a way you think you're still seeing an old clip when in fact Edward James Olmos has seamlessly woven that old clip into new footage. The end effect is that the viewer feels like they've sort of been taken backstage to see what has been going on from the Cylon point of view.

Another pretty consistent complaint is the lack of new major plot developments (aka the story presents no surprises and doesn't ultimately tell us anything we didn't already know). Again, I would say that it's in the subtle fleshing out of plot points that the movie achieves it's greatest success; you'll find yourself nodding your head agreeing with why characters are doing what they're doing, but at the end of a scene or at the end of the movie you'll find you have gained a deeper understanding into why certain characters did the things they did. Also, would viewers really like anything new plot-wise to occur in a movie that attempts to further explain the events of the first two seasons? I think more complaints would be seen if the movie tried to take the story and plot in a radically new direction.

With a total runtime of almost 70 hours, Battlestar Galactica spanned many different plot arcs and themes and explored many different characters to provide us with a truly excellent show. It's unreasonable, and in fact, arguably unwanted, to try to cram that much exposition into a two hour movie. What The Plan instead tries to do, and what it succeeds in doing, is providing a bit more exposition on characters and plot elements that didn't get as much focus during the show, while also providing some thematic material that allows BSG fans to continue probing the differences and similarities between humans and Cylons. Watch it with an open mind, and most of all, watch it in context; realize that the movie is not trying to tread especially new ground but instead sit comfortably within an existing storyline and take you behind the scenes so that the ground already treaded makes more sense. While the movie certainly didn't have any epiphanies of the scale present in the TV show, thinking about the movie in the hours since watching it has made me aware of the subtle things I did glean from seeing it. These realizations post-movie have really made me want to rewatch the entire series over again, and the insights gained from The Plan will make re-experiencing the show that much better. For anyone who plans on seeing Battlestar Galactica again and enjoying it even more, The Plan is highly recommended.",1256774400,13,3246,4.731448763250883
3935020,4,B002HRF68A,"I've watched the film twice now and was glad I listened to the director commentary before posting my review. I didn't purchase the film but rented it from my local Blockbuster store to see how the DVD looked. I personally don't care for the artificial film grain BSG effects has always added, but I guess others out their love it. I have to expect the Blueray Version would look far superior to the DVD image. Someday I may be able to compare as I will someday purchase this film along with the entire BSG series on Blue Ray.

The Plan is the final installment to the retelling of Battlestar Galactica. The film does not answer every continuity question a fan may have had, but it certainly answers some important questions. Others have said the film is a hacked clip job, I completely disagree and felt Edward James Olmos and his crew did a great job. The effects were excellent and this film truly has the best rendered effects of the series especially with the cylon basestars. The film covers 2 days before the attacks to 296 days after. The film is from the cyclons perspective and Dean Stock well as brother Cavil is the main character of the film. Every human cyclon except #3 D'Anna was able to come back for filming new footage. The beginning of the attacks does feature D'Anna only except its recycled footage from the series. Also any appearance of Kara Thrace in the film is recycled footage from the series. Of all the actors who were able to come back, #4 Simon has the best new footage and perspective not seen in the series.

As I said in the title of my review, I highly recommend watching this film to fans of the series, but feel the film is a tough sell to recommend to first time viewers who never watched the series especially the pilot. Years from now there will always be people who watch ""The Plan"" before watching the rest of the series and it will be a disappointment because they will get answers to questions they didn't have yet. Anyone who buys the series, I say this film belongs at the end of the collection, not the beginning.

Questions I had before watching this film and still have after watching it are:
Why does #1 Brother Cavel destroy #7 model Daniel?
What causes #1 to override what the final 5 had planed with the humans and cylons?
Who are models #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #8 based off of?
Why did the final 5 make human bodies and than assume identities in the 12 colonies?
When did the mechanical centurions make the transition from talking robots that carried firearms to silent walking robots with concealed machine guns in arms?

All these questions I have unanswered hopefully will some day be answered in ""Caprica"".

Battlestar Galactica will always be one of the greatest shows of the 2000s and this film is an great final addition to the series.

Any new information fans may learn of the show they will get from Caprica. As said in the commentary, this really is it with BSG as the sets are gone and the actors have moved on.",1256688000,,2968,4.476894639556377
3935021,3,B002HRF68A,"""Battlestar Galatica: The Plan"" has an ambitious agenda; it's designed to show us all of the things that the Cylons did to destroy and track the fleet from how Boomer was ""activated"", why Leoben developed an obsession with Starbuck to how one of the ships was boarded by the Cylons, to why one of the 5's was strapped with explosives and tries to blow up the BG. It fills in the various cracks that the series never had an opportunity to fill us in on--the ""plan"" that Cylon Brother Cavil (Dean Stockwell) launched once he was aboard the Galatica. The good news is that it answers many of the questions fans had as to how the Galatica was found so easily, why Number 6 tried to discredit Baltar at one point, etc. but because it focuses on these tiny back stories, the film doesn't quite hold together as a narrative jumping through the series four years.

Director and actor Edward James Olmos (Commander Adama)does solid job of integrating pre-existing footage from various episodes and seamlessly blending them in with the new footage that gives us the operrational plan that the Cylons used to try and destroy humanity before realizing that they might be misguided. Unfortunately, he's trapped by the structure and plots of the various episodes that these vinettes are designed to enlighten us about. In many respects, this movie would have played better as webisodes similar to ""Face of the Enemy"" (and why that isn't on here since it does let us see the stories that fall between the cracks of various episodes were resolved is beyond me. I suspect that Universal will put out yet another disc for fans to buy). The script by Jane Espenson (she wrote ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes which makes sense when you see ""The Plan"" as well as being a regular writer on ""Dollhouse"" and ""Tru Calling"")is certainly flawed as it is dependent on knowing the episodes in the series and the outcomes to make sense of them (my wife watched the show and I had to explain what was going on and why because she doesn't seen all of the episodes of the series). As a result, it doesn't hold up as a TV movie much less a direct-to-DVD (or Blu-ray in this case)movie either. It probably should have been released as a bonus disc on ""The Complete Series"" but wasn't ready by the street date of the set).

Still, it is worth watching for fans of the series and for newbies I'd suggest starting from the first episode and working your way through the last and THEN watching this becuae it doesn't hold together as well as ""Razor"" or even some of the webisodes.

Image quality is spectacular with some truly stunning visual effects sequences that shows us the destruction of Caprica. This is probably one of the best looking discs for the show simply because it's a two hour movie and some change (in the form of extras)on a BD 50 disc whereas the series usually had anywhere from three to four episodes per disc. Clarity is remarkably sharp and colors pop. The show deliberately looks grainy and it's not going to be as brilliant looking as, say, ""Braveheart"" because of the gritty look of the show but it looks exceptionally good.

Extras include ""From Admiral to Director"" a behind-the-scenes glimpse at Olmos' turn in the director's chair for a two hour TV movie. ""The Cylons of the Plan"", ""The Cylon Attack"" and ""Visual Effects: The Magic Behind 'The Plan'"" takes us behind-the-scenes into everything from the writing/planning of the episode to the post-production visual effects used to portray the destruction of Caprica. We also get deleted scenes and a commentary track with Olmos and writer/producer Espenson. There's also BD-Live material connectivity an exclusive ""Battlestar Galatica"" trivia challenge for the Blu-ray only.

Flawed precisely because it tells us the behind-the-scenes stories that were portrayed in the series thus making it episodic and hard to follow for newbies, ""Battlestar Galatica: The Plan"" doesn't hold together the way ""Razor"" did (where you could watch the two hour movie without having seen most of the series and make sense of things)nor does it hold togethre as well as the individual webisodes of ""Face of the Enemy"" but it's a nice addition for fans. It's clear after this though that Universal has milked the ""Battlestar Galatica"" franchise dry for this segment of the story. It's good but far from the brilliance that this outstanding series often displayed.",1256688000,9,4382,4.8063660477453585
3935022,5,B002HRF68A,I really enjoyed it.  It fills in the gaps that were in many of the episodes.  I liked seeing much of the focus on Cavil's character with him leading (or failing to lead) the rest of the Cylons.  I also liked seeing how the Cylons were `corrupted' from being around the humans.  It was hard to remember some of the episodes that were flashed back to.  For those that complained about nudity or sex - I don't get it.  There were maybe 2-3 quick scenes with nudity.  Probably would get a PG rating in the theater - maybe.  Overall it is an awesome movie to fill in some of the gaps in some of the episodes.  It was a lot to absorb and I will probably need to watch it a few more times to catch everything.  It was all put together very well.  I hope they do more.,1256688000,,761,4.040268456375839
3935023,4,B002HRF68A,"(NO SPOILERS) I'm sure it was no easy task to meld various new shots with film from the series. With that understanding, I'd rate The Plan just a bit above ""average"". There were certainly some insteresting (even memorable) scenes, but the sum of the parts did not quite measure up to a whole.

Razor was an amazing film, yet The Plan does not come close. Are we still glad to have it? Of course we are.

However, even ""average"" BSG is better than most of the garbage that populates television. Though my high expectations for The Plan did not pan out, I still enjoyed the experience.

So watch The Plan for what it is, and not so much what we would expect (hope) it to be. Just to see some of the cast and characters in action again is worth savoring, in my humble opinion.",1256688000,,773,4.317241379310345
3935024,2,B002HRF68A,"Before watching this I was a bit skeptical .The fact that it went right to DVD was a big warning sign that the quality would be lacking. It looks like a great idea gone not incredibly wrong but definently off the mark of quality that the series often contained . First of all be prepared for a very narrow story retracing the final cylons,limited new scenes and very little battlestar galactica scenes. While some of this is understandable it still leaves one with a feeling after viewing it that this was poorly done. Razor was far better almost 5 stars compared to the Plan which gets barely two.

Maybe this is the best they could have done with the source material and the outcome already known. It really shoudnt have been made and if so could have easily been far better if a few more plot surprises were put in. Like the show coming this winter on syfy Caprica it most likely will just continue to cheapen the series.

What made BSG so interesting was the overall plot of a cylon machine turnig on the human creators and destroying them than relentlessly chasing the Galactica through space as a mythical earth was searched for. Caprica while it probably will be somewhat interesting cant possibly recapture this just as surely as the plan didnt.",1256688000,,1253,4.614349775784754

3935026,5,B002HRF68A,"First off a minor spoiler warning that I refer to various Cylon characters by name below, so if you're not already familiar with the entire series (and really you should be before checking this out anyway) you risk some spoilers by reading this.

I understand where people are coming from in some of the more negative reviews.  Revisiting old territory leaves little room to learn anything new, and the movie certainly lives up to that assumption.  However, I am a big fan of revisiting familiar material from a new perspective, and this was pulled off perfectly.  First and foremost, this is Cavil's story during the first 2 seasons of the show.  Cavil, as fans of the series remember, was introduced at the very end of season two and he would go on to be an amazing character.  Seeing what he and his other self were up to prior to their original appearance on the series was alone worth the price of the DVD.  But it didn't stop there.  Leoben got a nice bit of attention, which pleased me greatly because I felt he was underrepresented in the final episodes of the series.  Doral had a funny couple of scenes.  We finally learn more about Six's Shelley Godfrey persona.  We got to see a whole other side to Boomer's story from season one.  The Final five mostly don't get much revealed, but we do get to see a lot of Anders in action as the leader of the resistance movement on Caprica.  The most pleasant surprise in this film though, was Simon.  The character had a great introduction in the season 2 episode ""The Farm,"" but they never really did anything interesting with him again.  Here he has his own story, and it's one of the better ones featured in this film.  I'm very pleased that they finally gave him something interesting to do.

This film definitely lived up to expectations.  My expectations anyway, which is why it gets a full five stars from me.  Thank you to everyone in the production for this final gift.",1256688000,10,1929,4.539130434782609

I was and still am a BSG Fan. Yes it was nice to see who #6 was talking to. But $23.99 (Blu-ray) for a bunch of all ready recorded scenes splice with cut scenes and few few new scenes was way to much.
(Spoiler if you haven't seen)Plus the ending also I found somewhat odd and leaves another unanswered question. The boy that befriended who befriended Brother Cavil on Galactica whose name was John which near the end of the 4th season of Galactica Brother Cavil's name was John. Was the boy a real person or was it Cavil's ultra-ego?

3935028,3,B002HRF68A,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.  Unfortuantely, The Plan is a rather disapppointing film.  What we were promised was a view of the attack on humanity from the Cylon point of view, which is a very interesting idea with potential for great storytelling.  Unfortuately, all we really got was a glorified clip show that would be better suited for the deleted scenes section of a DVD.  Hell, we don't even get all the Cylon models; Number Three is absent from the film altogether.  Maybe Lucy Lawless had better things to do or maybe Syfy was trying to save money.  Regardless of the reason, the movie was lacking something without her presence.

Of course, The Plan does have some fine moments.  In particular, the character of Cavil really shines through -- even more so than he did during the series run.  Dean Stockwell owns this character in every way.  It was always odd for me to see the guy who played the comedic character of Al in Quantum Leap take on the role Number One.  Stockwell was given a truly unrepentent charcter and made him a joy to watch for that very reason.

Overall, The Plan did not live up to my expectations.  Maybe I've finally moved on from Battlestar Galactica.",1256688000,,1226,4.6465116279069765
3935029,2,B002HRF68A,"...what a disappointment The Plan is. The Cylon plan and machine-god monotheism are given short shrift and serve only to serve as skeleton, fleshed out by a pastiche of scenes from the four seasons of, in my opinion, the best drama series to air on television to date. There are no new revelations, and no significant changes in perspective or tone for the show. The Plan is little more than a clip show.",1256688000,4,404,4.5479452054794525

Just like watching a history of Pearl Harbor or the launch of Challenger, watching events unfold is filled with dread as to what is to follow. The attack on the colonies was stunning.  You need to compair this movies to stargates awful Ark of Truth.  This was as good as any episode in the series. I only wish the movie Caprica was nearly as good.",1256688000,3,422,4.25
3935031,3,B002HRF68A,"I am still a faithful fan of BSG and watched it religiously.  I was looking forward to the DVD since the final episode of the series.  Like others have said, the series was cut way too short, they originally didn't know where it was going or how it would end, but I believe they pulled it off and was pleased.
With that all said, if you know the series, you know this is supposed to be from the view of the Cylons leading up to the attack on the Colonies and the aftermath of the hunt for the remnants of Humanity.  However, with the amount of plot holes and ""What the frack ? or How the frack?"" moments that the series had in it, don't expect this to fill many of them in.  I think they did a good job of filling in the Cylon plan but not much more.
The additional CGI was no better than the series, but wasn't expecting it to be better.  The attack on the 12 Colonies was AMAZING and really pulled me in and made me feel the horror of what was actually taking place.  It gave me a whole new perspective of what the survivors where really facing.
The movie stars F-Cavil and C-Cavil as well as the other Cylons(lots of Anders).  Completely missing from the movie was D'Anna (Lucy Lawless) which I feel was a big letdown.  I also don't believe that Tigh, or Tory had any new scenes either.
Overall, if you're looking to see the attack and up to the first ""truce on Caprica"" from the eyes of the Cylons, then you won't be disappointed.  If you're looking to fill in the missing gaps and wrap up some plot holes, then you'll be let down.  I almost gave this 4 stars but it JUST missed that mark.  Hopefully this is not the END of BSG.  Hopefully the fan support for this DVD and the previously released DVD's will prove that the fans are there and hopefully we can get some future BSG projects that can help fill in some gaps that we all would like to have answered!

3935032,5,B002HRF68A,"I will be the first to admit I was not expecting much from this release after the uninspired BSG:Razor. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. Let me say right up front, this is ***NOT*** the thing to watch if you're taking your first foray into the reimagined Battlestar Galactica universe. They spill multiple events in this movie that should be seen unfolding over several seasons to really grasp. There will be a spoiler about every five minutes that will decrease your enjoyment when you watch the series. Do that FIRST, you have been warned...

Spoilers commence here:

Based on other reviews here, this film seems to be a little hit or miss for some people. Some find it's narrative disjointed, but I'm one of those that finds it a ""hit"". I thorougly enjoyed the way the storyline dances through the first several seasons filling in the bits of unseen Cylon machinations within the fleet and on Caprica. It was intriguing to see the Cylon sabotage campaign which caused the fleet such distress from the flipside, and see Cavil tearing his hair out figuratively as each intrigue never seems to become the final deathblow that he imagined. Dean Stockwell's fine dual performance as the Fleet and Caprica Cavils is worth the price of admission alone as far as I'm concerned. Add to that one of the best musical scores for a SciFi space opera ever, and enough visual effects eye candy to put one into a sugar coma for a week, and I think this is definitely a winner. I was ready to rewatch it almost as soon as it was over.

The Blu-ray image quality is fantastic (yes many interior/action scenes do show film grain, it's a creative choice and SUPPOSED to be there. The destruction of the colonies sequence is eye popping and gorgeous though, and it's going right to the top of the list for demo'ing my home theater. Really shows off HD video to excellent effect.",1256688000,,1860,4.664634146341464
3935033,4,B002HRF68A,"'The Plan' is not a stand alone film; it's more like a Cylon character study full of non-groundbreaking plot revelations and appreciated but possibly irrelevant back-story .  For the unapologetic BSG fans, who even enjoyed the loose ends left post-finale to boggle our minds but who still crave answers , this is certainly a necessary addition to your DVD collection.  It deserves praise, as it provides a fresh perspective on the show's devious skinjobs; however, it is not the end-all, plot hole-filling, series-capper many had hoped for.

The short film is mostly fresh material, but there is a heavy amount of stock footage as well.  It's presented like a series of somewhat disjointed cinematic vignettes, with over-arching themes and an illuminating spotlight on the Cylons, and it explores the side of the story shrouded in mystery during BSG's first two seasons.

We learn how the final five survive the nuclear holocaust on the Twelve Colonies, that set off T.V.'s most epic and well-written Space Opera.  The curtain pulled over their 2000yr old eyes is explained, and Boomer's sleeper state is fully elaborated on.  Ultimately, the primal source of the Human/Cylon conflict is dissected to near-Shakespearean lengths, making the analytic focus on the 'Toasters' a fascinating and welcomed move that accomplishes a great deal in limited amount of time.

The portrayal of the two Cavils is careful and poetic.  Anders receives the much needed attention he never got.  Leoben and Simon are also explored in an empathetic manner.  None of it is quite character-developing, but it does provide a copious amount of insight into the complexities and differences between each Cylon model and even within them.

Something I found a bit of a let down, was the complete absence of Cylon model #7, Daniel or even any mentioning of him.  But the series managed to due without telling that part of the story, so I guess 'The Plan' can too.

Highly Recommended.  With the caution to have practical expectations.",1256688000,,2007,5.076219512195122
3935034,2,B002HRF68A,"Told mainly from Brother Cavil's point of view aboard the Galactica, we're informed of the Plan itself within the first half hour. The rest of this unfortunate TV movie is clumsily stitched to BSG continuity - seeing the planning (or lack thereof) of the Cylon attempts to sabotage the Battlestar and its fleet. Working within such constricting bounds yields blas results, and the oft-revisited footage from seasons one and two of the TV show soon grows tiresome (particularly when scenes fans know intimately are lobotomized for the sake of moving forward the plot). More than ever I was hit with the urge to simply rewatch the entire series, start to finish, instead.

Thankfully, there were two well-crafted subplots that were threaded through the rest of this story. The first is of Anders and the Resistance, the second is of a refugee-turned-knuckledragger. Both of these are well worth your time, because they're incredibly engaging and well-paced (although occasionally the former suffers from the aforementioned plot-stitching).

All in all, this is sadly only rental quality. I'd much rather take 2 hours about Anders and the Resistance, with interludes of our newfound knuckledragging friend (who has issues of her own, but we won't post spoilers).",1256688000,8,1259,5.227722772277228

Should have titled it BSG: The Calvin Story
Maybe this was cobbled together to make some sense of the cobbled together season ""4.5""
I hold Edward James Olmos  in high regard- but he could only do so much with a limp script.
Not a good way to send off the series;
Madam President was conspicuous by her abscence;
There were times I thought this was all outtakes from season one and the miniseries strung together to  make some kind of sense.
Gripes about the whole damn thing:
1. The ""Gods' thing was dumb always stuck out like a sore thumb- a contrivance
2. The shaky zoom cam was dumb ditto or WAYYYYYYY overused
3. The word FRAK- you never hear the Earth equivalent of that anywheres near that in real life-and even less in the Military-unless  you are with the grunts
4. Many times the stories were still written to ""Teevee"" conventions of  plot and contrivances-
I admit it WAS rivetting and interest holding more often that not; I even teared up  at the very last episode-
even though it was foolish-here they all go on their separate ways on a wild unknown planet? Get real -survival would mean team strategy-a communal  outpost -or was that a 7-11 i saw just off in the distance?
5. The show was 'sorta' revolutionary-by normal Teevee standards;
But, by cable standards, wasn't worth nuking Caprica over;  (The titty bar in this episode  was kinda unique-or was that just on the DVD? but again were talking cable)
The CGI: I hate watching something and it all comes to a grinding halt when I see a spaceship and think: hey!-Im in a super Mario brothers game- howd that happen?
I say bring back models;
I must admit though the new RED DWARF 'Series 10' DID have me wonder-Is it live or is it memorex?-so  undetectable CGI isn't impossible
But as long as your eye and brain tell you its  just a flat one-dimension painting of pixels- it will always trigger a red flag with me;
'Just good enough' is NOT good enough
You cant tell the difference? You watch too much Tee vee
I like even numbers or rather whole numbers-BSG should have been FIVE seasons
ill kinda miss that gang (snif) they were like part of the family-oh wait  its just TV
I owned each season individually-and now the box set collection-Im qualified to gripe

I wanted to like this new movie, but it failed to deliver anything new or revelatory. I got closure after Battlestar ended, and watching this cylon perspective movie made with old footage mixed with new didn't re-create any kind of emotional impact for me. It was like watching a rerun with cutting-room floor scenes.

I'm not saying this movie is bad. It could have been so much better if the writer had just stuck to all-new material instead of interweaving old footage with new. Maybe the budget was lacking? And honestly, Cavil just isn't all that interesting when it comes down to his character. He's portrayed as this one-dimensional madman, but his demons are not completely exposed. There's no satisfaction in watching his character arc (it's not even an arc). He's a prick from beginning to end, and then you have the scene where he stabs the kid, which just completely felt gratuitous. You get more emotion and interest from watching Nixon in the Frost/Nixon interviews. Many other parts of the portrayals didn't quite work for me either, and overall, I felt this new movie didn't improve on how the series ended with various threads resolving character arcs.",1256601600,,1221,4.893719806763285
3935037,4,B002HRF68A,"The long-awaited tele-movie from Battlestar Galactica - The Plan has finally been released. Ever since the TV series ended in March 2009, I've been getting withdrawal symptoms. The finale was not overly bad, it was actually rather emotional and sad. However, still too many unanswered questions lingered. With The Plan, some of the unanswered questions have finally been answered.

The Plan actually started from 2 weeks before the Fall of Caprica to just around Season 2 of the TV series and not till the finale. I won't spoil it too much, but you do see more of the Cylons, their plottings and plannings that went completely unnoticed throughout the fleet. It was more like they formed a tiny little cult amongst themselves, held meetings within a makeshift chapel, possibly on Galactica and then plotted. Only the No. 1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 (Sharon Valerii) were plotting.

The entire Plan tele-movie was John or No. 1 driven. He's the leader, leading the rest of his race to destroy the humans. However, his brother model No. 1, Brother Cavil, sees things from a different point of view, which he doesn't and cannot accept. His vendetta against humanity must be absolute and unquestionably followed, even if resistance among his own model seems forthcoming, he will squash it all the same and proceed with his master plan. The disappearance of Shelly Godfrey was explained, it was rather sad what happened actually, but interesting to watch the banter.

I don't want to spoil too much more, but let's just say that through humanity's drive to survive and live on, Brother Cavil saw a possibility for peace between humans and Cylons and acted on it with the rest of the Cylons on Caprica. However, John refused to acknowledge peace, he insisted to teach the Final Five a lesson and hope they would come crawling back to him to tell him that he was correct. And so their plan was destroyed, leading to the rest of the season.

I was rather disappointed that Lucy Lawless didn't make an appearance in this series, because she was the driving force behind Season 3, and she had screen presence and could stand up to the No. 1s. They did show her in a short snippet here and there, probably taken from Season 3, but otherwise, she had no air time. Dean Stockwell was excellent as No. 1, conveying menace and vengeance throughout the entire movie. I will never again see him as Scott Bakula's personal computer from Quantum Leap!

It was also interesting to note that when the Basestars attacked the Twelve Colonies, they turn their top and bottom Y-shaped sections to fit a symmetrical configuration before launching their nukes. Something that was never shown again in the course of the TV series!

Highly recommended to all who followed the entire re-imagined series, and are still suffering from BSG withdrawal symptoms, continually wanting more, like me!",1256601600,2,2851,4.84394250513347

3935039,4,B002HRF68A,"Battlestar Galactica's ""The Plan"" basically follows two of Cavil's clones, with the film starting off with these two Cavil clones waiting in the airlock of the Battlestar Galactica as they are about to be jettisoned into space. We then go back ten months in time to the day of the Cylon attack of Caprica. From here we skip through time following the two Cavil clones, one stationed on the Battlestar Galactica and the other on Caprica, as we witness their failures to finish off the human race. One failed attempt after another follows for numerous reasons, including the fact that some of the Cylons, through close contact with the humans, begin to have feelings for them. And interestingly enough even one of Cavil's clones backs away from killing Kara Thrace ""Starbuck"", even though he has her in his gun sights. The Cylons eventually decide that they no longer have any interest in killing off the rest of the human race. And after a vote, which isn't unanimous, the Cylons leave the humans to pick up the remaining pieces of their kind.

This film has all of the gorgeous special effects of the TV show, but it does sometimes come across like a hodgepodge of the various episodes leading up to the airlock execution scene of the two Cavils, instead of a unique story unto itself, like we had with the Battlestar Galactica movie ""Razor"". I didn't feel like I learned too much more than I already knew from the series, though it was interesting to get a fuller view of the importance of the Cavil character, and learn more about how he was attempting to orchestrate the various Cylon models so as to finish off the human race. Though viewing the film, after recently watching the entire series, I was sometimes feeling that I was being short changed from what I had experienced while watching the series episode by episode. For instance, the incarceration scene of Kara in the hospital in the series episode, is breezed through in this film with merely a scene of her escape. In the episode she was disoriented and wondered what hellish place she was in, and what kinds of operations the Cylons had been performing on her, but in ""The Plan"" we jump from an exterior shot of the hospital, to her stabbing of the doctor, and then her quick escape, and we totally lose the sense of fear and anguish that Kara had experienced in that particular episode. The movie has this rapid fire quality to it that at times leaves one feeling that something is missing. Though one of the scenes that added a surprisingly visceral punch was Cavil's abrupt murder of the young boy, which was akin to Number Six's unsettling murder of a human baby in the pilot episode.

If one hasn't watched the series I wouldn't recommend starting with this movie since it also gives away some of the surprises about who among the humans are the Cylons. And for those who have watched all of the episodes, even though ""The Plan"" fails to create the same kind of drama that the episodes offered as the viewer gradually learned the various secrets of the series, this film is still worth watching, especially in HD, as it fills in some of the missing pieces.",1256601600,,3127,4.64259927797834
3935040,1,B002HRF68A,"I suppose sitting over drinks the idea of retelling the first couple of seasons of BSG from the Cylon POV was a good one, especially when they found out they could use some new material containing nudity.  The realization of this dream, though, is just a warmed-over clip show featuring pointless scenes of (largely) third-tier cast members failing utterly to provide a coherent narrative.  More damningly, it contradicts the series in key places.  Just awful.",1256601600,3,460,5.1066666666666665
3935041,2,B002HRF68A,"The Plan wasn't horrible. It just wasn't that good. If you are a BSG fan, you'll probably buy this dvd like I did. But, don't expect alot out of it. It will give you a slight BSG fix.

Prequels just don't work well. The story felt jumpy, rushed, and disjointed...like a collection of deleted scenes thrown together with some new stuff. Some of the special effects were even shaky. Way below the BSG standard.

Without going into specifics, and (gasp) placing spoilers in this review, a few small questions were resolved. For example, the person who met with Six at the fountain. However, there are no big revelations or reveals in this movie. Just lots of Cavil and Anders with a little Six thrown in.

In summary, you could skip The Plan and not miss anything.

p.s. I heartily disagree with reviewers who say The Plan is better than Razor. Razor is head and shoulders better than this mediocre attempt.",1256601600,7,904,4.63125
3935042,5,B002HRF68A,"First of all, if you haven't seen at least the first two seasons, and if you don't know about the Final Five as revealed in season four, you could find yourself very confused by this movie. In some ways, The Plan is a disjointed film - but it's the nature of the story being told. The Plan shows events that the viewer is expected to have already seen from a different perspective.

And it's pulled off brilliantly.

To avoid spoilers, I'll say only this about the story: The anchor is Cavil, aka Cylon #1. Though we get numerous sub-plots involving other Cylons and their human connections, it's Cavil that provides the main thread that keeps the story going. And make no mistake, Dean Stockwell's performance is a revelation in itself. Already a sci-fi legend, I don't think I could overstate how extraordinary he is in this picture.

Edward James Olmos does a fantastic job directing, matching the look and feel of past episodes, revisiting scenes from the series and weaving in the new elements. And, of course, it all starts with the writing. Jane Espenson has constructed a very complex, multi-dimensional story without talking down to the audience or trying to create a simplistic summary to lure in new fans - because The Plan isn't for new fans. It's a last hurrah for the devoted.

The series finale was wonderful in many ways, but even as die-hard a fan as I am, I have to admit the coda left me a little disappointed. I won't dwell on why here; suffice it to say, for me, The Plan officially concludes the Battlestar Galactica series in stunning fashion.",1256601600,5,1566,4.663043478260869
3935043,2,B002HRF68A,"...and not in a good way. This is a disjointed, disappointing mess, completely devoid of any sort of characterization or narrative arc or, ultimately, a reason for existing. It's random stuff you've already seen, augmented awkwardly by new random stuff you never cared about. For instance--and it's not possible for me to reveal any spoilers, because the movie itself reveals nothing of consequence--in the miniseries, Caprica 6 leaves Baltar in the public square to speak to someone off-camera. And now we finally learn who she said ""It's about time"" to: Cavil! Holy cow! And what was the substance of the subsequent conversation?

Cavil: ""Do you know what time the planet blows up?""

Six: ""7am.""

Cavil: ""Right.""

Major goosebumps!  If you find that exchange exciting, by all means buy The Plan, because it's chock full of such pointless ""revelations."" As for me, it affected my understanding of the rest of the miniseries not one iota. The Plan is completely superfluous.",1256601600,7,974,5.10062893081761
3935044,1,B002HRF68A,"I get that sex sells.  I do.  And I am certainly no prude.  But I am SICK TO DEATH of studios and filmmakers feeling the need to include mindlessly gratuitous sex and nudity just for the sake of making an extra buck.  The nudity and sex in this film get pointlessly graphic, and for NO REASON.  Overall, it does nothing to advance the story, or add to it.  It's just there.  And even when it might make a legitimate plot point, the sex could easily be implied rather that forced into the faces of the viewer.  We're smart people.  We are.  Man and woman lying naked in bed together?  They probably have a sexual relationship.  Man and woman in bed start kissing?  Cut away, and we are still smart enough to figure out what comes next.

But no.  We just HAVE to have a scene with a topless bartender in the background.  And we have to see full nudity in the showers, because as viewers, we are just not smart enough to figure out that people shower naked.  Does full frontal nudity do ANYTHING to help the story along?  No.  They could be wrapped in towels, for crying out loud, and the film would be JUST AS GOOD.

I love Battlestar Galactica: the stories, the actors, the effects, all of it.  But I lose a great deal of respect for filmmakers who feel they have to use sex and nudity to sell their films.  If the story cannot stand on its own without the gratuitous use of sex and skin, then it is a story not worth putting on film to begin with.  And what's sad is that the story of The Plan is a great one.

One can only hope that the broadcast version of The Plan might one day be available on Blu ray.  Am I alone in this?",1256601600,4,1627,4.154340836012862
3935045,3,B002HRF68A,"While as others have pointed out ""The Plan"" is better than ""Razor"" lets be honest everyone that's not saying a whole heck of a lot.  Come to think of it ""The Plan"" was better then the final episode again not saying a whole lot.  I don't hate ""The Plan"" by a long shot but just because something has the BSG label on it doesn't automatically make it good.  The problem with this installment from the BSG universe are twofold the obvious being that we already know what is going to happen seeing what is going to happen from a different angle doesn't make an already resolved plot line any more interesting.  The other problem is that there wasn't enough time now this may seem to contradict the previous sentence but I will explain.  There is some new information in here that is very good for example the boy that the Cavil on Galactica takes under his wing, the little family that the Simon has on a different ship in the fleet, the first days of the Caprica resistance under Anders with its own Brother Cavil undergoing his own crisis of faith.  These aspects could have been stitched into something new and unexplored if the producers of the show had tried a little bit harder but you get the feeling that the only thing everyone was concerned with was one last paycheck.  In the end while it is always a pleasure to see Dean Stockwell in action(one can always rely on him for good line delivery and interesting quotes)  that doesn't make up for a product that feels rushed and underdeveloped.

That being said some important gaps are filled in from the earlier and it is an entertaining enough way to spend two hours as long as you are not annoyed by a little repetition",1256601600,,1674,4.480263157894737

3935047,5,B002HRF68A,"I am not going to preface this with any grand statements about being a BSG fan from day one.  If I am taking the time to write this, you should suspect that already.

This movie really works in that it is a quiet story in a very noisy room.  It is about how life finds ways to disrupt our plans but not always in a bad way.  It is about reconciling what you think you want with what actually want.  It is about learning ""the truth"" isn't always in the safe black and white places we create.  It is about love in all its forms.

First, about the nudity.  It exists.  Get over it.  BSG was never a ""family friendly"" show given its themes, so if you were expecting something different here, then you are about to be sadly mistaken.  There are no basic cable broadcast guidelines to satisfy, so a story can be told in whatever way the storytellers wish.  The nudity is not gratuitous or in your face, so deal with the fact it is just another adult theme that BSG can use without restriction now.

Here is the crux of it: at its heart, this movie is about how the Cylons intended on destroying humanity for their perceived wrongs against the Cylon race, and how that plan changed literally everyone.  In the real world, it would have been nice to have been able to film scenes with all of the cast members, but monetarily that was not to be - everyone (including Lucy Lawless, contrary to another review here) is represented through previous footage in some fashion.  Jane Espenson wound all their stories together in a beautiful fashion, and Edward James Olmos mixed the stock footage together with the new that it was at times hard to tell which was which.  The story was engaging enough that I could suspend the fan's critical eye for the first running of the movie, and just enjoy the story Ms. Epenson and Mr. Olmos told.

Will you like it?  Hard to tell, but only because I don't know you.  If you sit back and let the story unfold, you will most likely find this an engaging work and a worthy addition to the BSG canon.  If you are watching this to see (fill in your favorite actor here)'s story expanded, you might be out of luck - and you also might be missing the point.  This is a quiet story not always about specific individuals, but rather about how an individual can affect others and how that ripples through even the most well laid out plan.  It is an intimate story told on a grand pallette, and thanks to the people in front of and behind the camera, it works beautifully.",1256601600,207,2486,4.3470715835141
3935048,2,B002HRF68A,"Some may hate me for what I am about to write and others may feel as I do. You know that father or mother that always tells their child, ""You could have done better than that"" when their child makes a 92 on a test? Well, that's me when it comes to Battlestar Galactica. Now, I by no means view myself at her mother, but the idea is still valid. Keep that in mind as you read this review.

I know for a fact Battlestar Galactica can be absolutely drop dread amazing. There have been moments watching the show where I've found myself standing on the back on my couch, touching the ceiling screaming ""WHAT!?!"" It is these moments that make the show what it is. It is so unpredictable. Mostly because the writers and producers, specifically Ronald D. Moore, like to just through random ideas into the pot and make them happen. I won't go into detail for fear of ruining the series for anyone but when they started the series they had no idea where is was going or how it was going to end. Somehow, it all worked out and became this epic science fiction phenomenon. Well, phenomenon might be taking a little too far as it only lasted four seasons but I won't go into the details about the show's premature ""cancellation"". I'm here to discuss the film that was released just over four hours ago. ""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.""

It sucked.

Mostly.

Like two out of five stars sucked.

Please don't kill me. I have my reasons.

The first, and I think one of the most obvious reasons, is how can a movie be unpredictable if you've already seen it from a slightly different view? We all knew what was going to happen. We knew which characters were cylons and which characters died and how. We knew. So it would be rather hard to make any giant twists in the plot of the show. That's understandable.

But what isn't...is that the CGI was about equal to a Sci-Fi (note the CORRECT spelling) original movie, which I honestly believe should be burned and never seen by human eyes again. I'm fairly sure this was a budget issue and I don't understand why. I mean, they just got done selling a TON of stuff from the show. They sold props, costumes, weapons...everything. Where did all this money go? It should have gone to this film! *stomps foot*

An increase in budget would have also increased the quality of writing that went into it. Now the writers for the film may be amazing, don't get me wrong, but I think they were rushed. The ideas were underdeveloped. They were there and I knew they had potential but I didn't see them developed as much as I thought they could have been. There were very few ""standing on the couch screaming"" moments and that left me wondering if I had really just watched a Battlestar Galactica movie.

Part of this could be due to the numerous clips from the series, clips we had already seen. Now, I get they were pivotal for the story line and needed to be there in order to make the story coherent but I feel like it could have been done better. It should have been done better. This is Battlestar people. We've got a reputation to uphold.

The bottom line here is don't go in expecting all these twists and jaw-dropping moments. You're watching the same story over again from a different set of eyes. You already know what's going to happen. Appreciate the small amount of fresh material it offers and pray the sales are amazing so we can get more.",1256601600,28,3373,4.434571890145396
3935049,4,B002HRF68A,"Despite being a huge BSG fan, I wasn't really looking forward to ""BSG: The Plan"".  After BSG: Razor failed to impress, I wasn't expecting much from The Plan.  Fear not, The Plan, hereinafter referred to as TP, actually works.  It plays like a filler episode, exploring various mysteries which the writers never fully explained to the viewers.  TP follows a chronological order, beginning before the Cylon attack, going to ""33"", ""Water"", ""You Can't Go Home Again"", ""Litmus"", ""Six Degrees of Separation"", and ending with season 2's finale of ""Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II"".  Kudos to director EJ Olmos and writer Jane Espenson for seamlessly threading in the new scenes and better fleshing out previously thin characters.

Mysteries such as the following are explored...

- Who did Caprica-Six meet with on Caprica, after talking with Gaius Baltar in the marketplace?
- Did Boomer really blow up the water tanks?
- How did Shelly Godfrey escape from the Galactica?
- How did Sam Anders and his Pyramid team escape and form their resistance?
- How did Ellen Tigh survive the Cylon nuclear attack on Picon?
- How did Leoben become so enamored of Starbuck?
- Why did the Cylons suddenly stop their attack when the BSG Marines linked up with Sam's resistance on Caprica?

We also get to see more of Boomer's internal conflicts between Cylon and human facets, as well as a deeper insight into the Number Four model, Simon.  A Simon model is shown to be sympathetic to the human cause, even marrying a human (played by EJ Olmos' actual wife) and raising a family.  We see Cavil's machinations as he attempts to orchestrate several Cylons into causing massive damage to the Fleet.

The computer graphics for TP are vastly superior to the shots used during the TV series, and the viewers are shown some scenes from the Cylon attack on the Colonies.  Interestingly, TP also has a graphic sex scene, as well as graphic male and female frontal nudity not unlike the infamous scene from Starship Troopers.  Some of the nudity felt rather gratuitous and excessive; was it really necessary to show Ellen Tigh and Cavil meeting in a topless bar?

Minus 1-star because President Roslin, aka Mary McDonnell, and Number Three, aka Lucy Lawless, are never shown, either in a flashback or inserted new footage!  Starbuck, Lee Adama, Dr. Baltar, and Helo are shown in clips, but no new footage from them either.

All in all, a very good pickup for any BSG fan.  EJ Olmos has said that if TP sells well, then we can expect to see even more BSG movies in the future.  Other potential story lines might include the origins of the Final Five, what happened to the survivors after they reached Earth, or more about Starbuck's character, especially her fateful mission where she ""died"".  TP makes you wish SciFi (aka SyFy) didn't end BSG so soon.

**A quick word about the Blu-Ray discs; the image quality is solid.  The DTS soundtrack sounds great, especially in the Cylon Attack scenes.  It's a treat to hear Bear McCreary's music again.

Other features; commentary by director EJ Olmos and writer Jane Espenson, 15 minutes worth of deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes look at EJ Olmos' directorial BSG debut, twenty minute visual effects feature, a cylon primer, and a short with Michael Trucco discussing a human resistance attack.",1256515200,129,3306,4.864285714285714

For me The Plan provides supplemental background for the BSG universe. Unless you're a fan or knowledgeable about the BSG universe this probably isn't  so interesting. BUT, I think most BSG fans will find it interesting  and entertaining when considered a background feature. It can feel like a rehash of events from already seen episodes. Still I found this look at the series through the end of season 2 interesting.

The Plan is formatted as a standalone feature length video (1h 55m) and it kept my attention for the whole time. I don't think it's a good as the main series on it's own, but as I said, I see it as a supplement adding depth to the main series arc.
