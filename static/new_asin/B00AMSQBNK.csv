5453358,5,B00AMSQBNK,These are among those films my father in law loved and got me to watch and love. I bought three or four copies and gave them to each of our children.

5453362,5,B00AMSQBNK,"I pre-ordered this 2 months ago and just got it today(3/12).

They have the picture of the 70th anniversary edition of Casablanca on the case but according to the details on back it is NOT! It is the old 2008 Blu-Ray release with inferior picture and sound! Luckily this info is wrong and it is really the latest and greatest that has the 4K transfer yielding much better picture quality and a DTS-HD Master Audio track for better sound.",1363046400,144,437,4.531645569620253
5453363,5,B00AMSQBNK,"I've always considered African Queen and Casablanca as two of the best films of the golden era. The acting ability of Humphrey Bogart, Katherine Hepburn, and Ingrid Bergman is truely showcased in these films, as well as those in supporting roles (especially Peter Lorre and Paul Henreid).
I owned both of these on DVD and have recently upgraded to blu-ray. The blu-ray transfers on both are spectacular. The hi-def sharpness, color saturation, and audio are a huge improvement over the DVD's. It's very nice to see such high-quality transfers on these special classics. Had I known they were going to be available together, as a 2-pak, I'd have waited. This is a great deal.",1361404800,6,674,4.921052631578948
5453364,5,B00AMSQBNK,"Everyone is in love with Rick

It is 1942, the Nazi occupation of France. Refugees must take a long and torturers rout Through Casa Blanca on their way to America; there ""Everybody comes to Rick's.""  Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America. Rick is played by Humphrey Bogart.

Here we also stay for a while to watch a drama unfold. There are overlapping stories. One of a young couple trying to get to America and the girl wondering if a girl should have to do something naughty was wondering what would happen if her husband, ""a boy in many ways"", would find out? A second rate crook (Peter Lorre) obtains something of value at the expense of two German curriers. A Police Captain (Claude Rains) is shocked to find there is gambling going on at Rick's as he stuffs his pocket with his gambling earnings. Many other stories surround the main theme of a love triangle that started in Paris and now can mean so much to individuals or the effort for freedom.

Will the Nazi's win their prize?
Will Capt. Renault get the young girl?
Will Rick get away with Ilsa?

This film has become quite a classic. There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film. You will find yourself kibitzing. One memorable seen for all is the showdown where the Germans are singing ""Watch on the Rhine"" and Yvonne (Madeleine LeBeau) over powers them leading the ""La Marseillaise.""

Cannot tell if it is Blu-ray or just the big screen but many details are all of a sudden visible. It does not add to the story but is improves the viewing experience.

----------------------------------------------------------
Great story punctuated by a great making of film on the Blu-ray

Based on a novel by C.S. Forester, adapted for the screen by Director / Writer John Huston. September 1914, in Africa during WW1, everyone is escaping the Huns. An unlikely pair, drunkard Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) and  the reverend's (Robert Morley) spinster sister, Rose Sayer (Katharine Hepburn) escaping down the river form a relationship that may prove fatal to the Germans pride gunboat ""The Louisa"" with a 6 pounder. And then again, we have to get past rapids, leaches, and a German Fort.

Usually Blu-ray only enhances the visual but cannot enhance the story or dialog. However, with this presentation the DVD extra actually enhances the movie.  Watch the film again after watching the extras. I did not realize that the film was shot in Technicolor. The sound (probably due to a better T.V. seems to have improved also.",1360540800,4,2928,5.437086092715232

I have a  XBR-65X930C and Sony's flagship blue ray player. Just getting the quality of what I am seeing on one picture is a great price!
Getting both of these classic movies is,,  again TOO GOO TO PASS UP. Buy with confidence!
The products arrived well packed and on time! Sound and picture I would rate 10 out of ten and I don't often give so generously
It just dose not get any better than this. By the way the format I bought was BLU RAY / BD. BEWARE!  Some of these reviews are for DVDs and VHS tapes.
Please make sure that the review you are reading is for what this package is. Blu Ray only, I ACTUALLY READ A REVIEW FROM A PERSON WHO REVIEWED A TITLES WERE FROM THEM SEEING THE MOVIE IN THE THEATER.  NO PURCHASE Seriously!!!!
I have been been working around video since I was 11 years old. I AM 61. I can modestly call my self an expert. This combination I purchased was on time and value priced and super quality. What more can you ask.
Get them while they are still available. If you are a Bogart / Hepburn these titles are an absolute must!",1489190400,7,1256,4.199170124481328

5453703,5,B00AMSQBNK,"I really dislike Casablanca but I love John Huston, so I got this mostly for The African Queen. In case you're concerned, it is two separate Blu Ray replete with bonus material. Casablanca has a ton of extras, including a so-awkward-it-hurts introduction by Bogie's widow, the great Lauren Bacall (she reads some horrendously banal promotional copy that one assumes she first became acquainted with moments before the camera started rolling). African Queen has one extra feature, a terrific retrospective documentary made by, oddly enough, Nicholas Meyer, aka, the guy who directed the even numbered Star Trek movies. It features the typical talking head interviews (including, of course, Martin Scorsese) and has a weird moment where someone seems to suggest that John Huston may have unknowingly employed a cannibal during the film's preproduction period in Africa. What a film, though, it still truly holds up - Bogie and Hepburn in a beautiful vision of hard-earned middle-aged love, their gentle domesticity arising amid the harsh indifference of the ubiquitous river's edge jungle. Did I say it ""holds up""? It's actually far more entertaining and emotionally honest than any romantic comedy made since the 90's. Casablanca, though, is really hard to endure - phony and melodramatic with little to offer beyond some amusing work by the great cast of secondary characters. No wonder Marcel Dalio didn't take a screen credit!",1484092800,,1428,5.295154185022026

5453705,5,B00AMSQBNK,"What can you say about ""Casablanca"" that hasn't been said before?  A classic!  Added it to our collection, and had fun watching it again.  Bogart and Bergman work their magic, along with wonderful performances by Claude Raines, Peter Lorre, etc.  ""African Queen"" is just plain fun watching Bogart and Hepburn squabble their way down a river in a derelict boat, toward their target, the Germans.

Casablanca:  American expat Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns and runs a nightclub and casino in Casablanca, Morocco.  Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) is the wife of resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and former lover of Rick Blaine.  Rick who has always maintained a policy of indifference and noninterference in all matters political, must decide if he wants to help the woman he loves and her husband.

The African Queen:  Charlie Allnut (Humphrey Bogart) is the boat captain of the tramp steamer ""African Queen"".

Paul Henreid gives a noble performance that rounds out the core of this excellent drama.  Claude Rains is perfect as the lovingly moral Captain Renaud / Renault, desperately trying to be amoral. Arthur ""Dooley"" Wilson give Sam a nobility and soul that could easily be lost in the pre-civil rights era of the 1940's  By todays standards this film is quaint and dated.  I liked it the first time I saw it.  The second time I saw it, to my surprise, it made me cry.

5454403,5,B00AMSQBNK,"Casablanca, the best movie ever made.

I have over 1000 DVDs and Blu-Rays in my collection.  Casablanca is is by far the best.

As someone involved in the motion picture business I can tell you that students study the movie Casablanca. Many consider the script to be perfect.  It's hard to imagine other characters playing these roles.  Interesting to note that Ronald Reagan was considered for the role of Rick.

About five years ago, I had the opportunity to see Casablanca at the Stanford theater.  ( All movies are better when seen in a theater with others  as opposed to at home.)  It turned out I was sitting next to some female college students whose parents had ""forced"" them to see the movie. Before the movie started they told me they couldn't possibly like a black and white, 60-year-old movie.  I said to them, ""give this movie a chance, you may like it"".  Near the end of the film where Ilsa gets on the plane with her husband I look over at the college girls and they were crying.  On the way out of the theater they told me they loved Casablanca and had a new perspective on old movies.

Another surprise for some is the fact that I went to this movie at about 10:30 PM on a Wednesday night. I did get in, but they were completely sold out!

Actually, I would recommend purchasing these two movies separately.  I find combination movies harder to find on the shelf.
***********
Rick: I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
***********

Rick: Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for.

Victor Laszlo: You might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

Rick: Well, what of it? It'll be out of its misery.

Victor Laszlo: You know how you sound, Mr. Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.
**********

Ugarte: You despise me, don't you?

Rick: If I gave you any thought I probably would.
********

Rick: And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.

Captain Renault: That is my *least* vulnerable spot.
********

Major Strasser: You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.

Captain Renault: We musn't underestimate ""American blundering"". I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918.
********

Major Strasser: Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

Rick: It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

Heinz: Can you imagine us in London?

Rick: When you get there, ask me!

Captain Renault: Hmmh! Diplomatist!

Major Strasser: How about New York?

Rick: Well there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.",1423180800,,2791,4.690721649484536

5454627,5,B00AMSQBNK,"Double-features don't come any better than this one. Casablanca is on almost every list of the ten best movies ever made, often at #1. The African Queen was Bogart's only Academy Award winning performance, and was unavailable on DVD or Blu-ray until 2010. Both make the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 movies of all time.

Casablanca was a 1942 production about life in North Africa at the time of the expected German occupation, not a lot different from many other films of the time, but the stellar cast (Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre) and a topical script caught the wartime mood of the public and the film became a classic, its strength growing rather than diminishing through the many years since. It has two famous lines which have entered the language: ""Play it again, Sam"", which exact line was never spoken in the film; and ""I'm shocked, shocked, that gambling is going on in this establishment"", spoken by a police Colonel (Claude Rains) as he is pocketing his night's winnings at Rick's Caf. ""I'm shocked, shocked"" is used today as a sarcastic prefix to some outrage that the speaker finds not in the least surprising. This edition of Casablanca is loaded with extras, including commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and film historian Rudy Behlmer, a documentary on Bogart with Lauren Bacall, a documentary on the making of Casablanca, a remembrance from Bergman's daughter Pia Lindstrom and Bogart's son Stephen, a Bug's Bunny spoof ""Carrotblanca"", both a television and a radio adaptation of Casablanca, and theatrical trailers.

The African Queen (1951) was a World War I story from what was then German East Africa (Tanzania today). Directed by John Huston, it stars Humphrey Bogart as the captain of the small open steamboat grandly called The African Queen, and Katherine Hepburn as the spinster sister of a forlorn Anglican missionary (Robert Morley). The story is focused almost entirely on the two stars, and being the consummate professionals they were, they carry it off very well. The nature of the on-location African shoot can be surmised from the subtitle of the book that Hepburn wrote afterwards, ""The Making of the African Queen, or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Nearly Lost My Mind"". There is only one extra with The African Queen, but it is a doozy: the hour-long ""Embracing Chaos -- Making The African Queen"".

This is a real value for two of the greatest films from Hollywood's golden era.",1400457600,19,2531,4.950588235294117
5454628,5,B00AMSQBNK,"It's hard to decide which one is my favorite.  They are both truly great movies - with love at the core.  There is an all-star cast in either one, and many, many memorable phrases.  They have become part of our social network.",1399939200,,226,4.333333333333333

5454753,5,B00AMSQBNK,Saw this bargain priced double feature of two classic Bogart films and incidentally two of my favourites too. This was an opportunity not to be missed even though I have both on DVD. This Blu-Ray edition plays fine on my UK Blu-Ray player hinting that both discs are Region Free.

5454754,4,B00AMSQBNK,"I have a 42"" old style Sony WEGA CRT, & as I mostly watch older full screen films, I see no reason to replace it; it's one of the best CRT sets ever made.

For those who don't know, many Full screen films on blu are ""window boxed"": They put black bars on all 4 sides so it looks better on modern wide screen sets. The problem is on a full screen set with a full screen film, it shrinks the picture by exactly 20%.

My Blu-ray player has a 20% zoom option designed to solve the problem. It works; EXCEPT when the disc manufacturer labels zoom as a ""Prohibited operation"" by copyguard. Why they do that I have no clue, as zoom doesn't have any impact on piracy that I can tell!

I ordered this partly in hope that the Window Boxing / Pillar Boxing On African Queen would be defeatable on this (it isn't on the stand along blu of AQ).

Interestingly, on Casablanca, Zoom works & I can defeat the window boxing, but the AQ disc is the exact same disc I already had & Zoom is treated as a prohibited operation by the java copyguards (WHY??)

Oh well, other than the sales tax I'll come close to breaking even selling my old AQ & I didn't have Casablanca on Blu (though I already had 2 dvd versions!)",1392768000,,1194,4.151515151515151
