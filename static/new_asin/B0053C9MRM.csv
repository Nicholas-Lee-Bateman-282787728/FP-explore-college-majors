8455134,3,B0053C9MRM,"The aspect that most attracted me in this film was the turmoil through which the character of Bruce (Rodolphe Marconi) goes. Is he in love or not? Is his friend somewhat in love with him or not? Thats something awfully common in our lives, where love seems to be always in the wrong place, being corresponded to a certain level, but only to a certain level.
Its also interesting to see the boys pretty out of preconception towards their feelings. They don't ask themselves whether they are gay or not. They simply are, and let their feelings flow.
But the movie is awfully slow. We have to deal with sentiments that are going to be shown by gestures, actions, very little by words. And love is something that can bring great anguish. Thats what happens here.
As a hole, I think its a film that will let you enter in a world where people in their twenties will have already dealt with, and most people will be related to. I found the ending a bit out of the film, inexplicable. But lead me to a lot of thoughts.",1479600000,,1010,4.377659574468085
