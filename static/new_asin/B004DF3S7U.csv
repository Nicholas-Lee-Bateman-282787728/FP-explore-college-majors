4332365,5,B004DF3S7U,"This really have me a lovely set of buns in the early 90s and now, twenty+ years later, I am finding the outfits and music to be truly amusing, but am also finding the workout to be a real burner. The first several times I worked the DVD, I was only able to make it part of the way through. Am building up some strength and hope to be rocking buns of steel within the next few months! It worked once, so I'm counting on its effectiveness this time around.",1431388800,,455,4.066666666666666
4332366,5,B004DF3S7U,Here is another timeless classic.  I can highly recommend this video and attest to it's effectiveness.  Five stars!,1430870400,,115,5.333333333333333

4332372,5,B004DF3S7U,"Thanks so much for bringing this back!  I had 3  VHS versions, which I've used continuously since the 90's, and they're almost totally unviewable at this point.  I've been searching for the DVD version for years and I'm thrilled that you've finally made it.  I LOVE the very basic and simple nature of this workout.  I'm no good at learning long routines, which is what most workout videos do, and this certainly WORKS!  Tamilee also is great at explaining the purpose of the exercises and how to do them correctly so you don't injure yourself - critical now that I'm in my 50's and healing takes so much longer.  This is by far my favorite Buns of Steel and it's also short, so I can squeeze it into my busy life.",1417824000,10,714,4.404580152671755

4332374,4,B004DF3S7U,"True Buns Of Steel fans will appreciate this. New ones, not so much, unless you understand that this is a workout video/series that was big in the 90's and is now being released on DVD.  NOT a now 40-something Tammilee Webb doing the same workout, but 1990's 20-something Tammilee Webb.  It does not have the best picture quality, it does have 90's music and yes that's 90's fashion BUT it's being re-released for good  reason: those of us who remember the Buns Of Steel series know that it works and appreciate the new DVD format since VHS is a thing of a long, long past.

So would I have preferred to have seen an older, still-fit Webb performing this workout in present time? Sure.  But then who knows, the 90's version sure brings back good memories of tight buns back in the day, and it's somewhat comforting to know that nothing has changed.",1404172800,3,848,4.516339869281046
4332375,5,B004DF3S7U,"I wore out my VHS copy so i was glad to hear it was on DVD format, still makes me sore and i can definitely see a difference in my legs and butt.",1401148800,,145,3.4242424242424243
4332376,5,B004DF3S7U,"I remember doing this workout video with my mom in the living room when I was little, of course I never finished it though. I'm so glad it's now on DVD, time to throw out the VHS. It's true that this exercise video is old-fashioned and looks outdated, but now that I'm older I can't say just how much I love this workout! My mom and I keep doing this video at least twice a week and all I can say is that it truly works. Try to get past the bad video and sound quality, because this video is golden. If you want a great looking behind, stick with this workout and do it consistently. I will keep working out my bum with Tamilee Webb for the rest of my days.",1400716800,,657,3.984848484848485
4332377,2,B004DF3S7U,I loved these back in the day.  Thought it was a new version but just the old ones with a new case.,1395878400,,99,3.5
4332378,5,B004DF3S7U,Fail-proof workout...have been using this version since the 80's (along with others workouts incorporated) but this workout still kicks my ass. The ugly dimples lessen after 4-6 weeks of consistent use (3-4 days a week). Turn the volume off and put on your own music....enjoy!  Love this workout!,1366156800,8,296,5.166666666666667

4332381,5,B004DF3S7U,"BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE came out in V.H.S. format in 1991, I think, and was the exercise video that put Tamilee Webb on the map.  Other fitness instructors did the first two BUNS OF STEEL videos but starting with this third one, Tamilee Webb makes it her own and in fact BUNS OF STEEL has become her brand.  Kind of like thinking of Phil Collins when the band Genesis comes to mind even though Peter Gabriel founded  the act.

This 2011 CLASSIC BUNS OF STEEL reissue is the same workout - not a remake, but rather the video from twenty years earlier in D.V.D. format. If you're buying BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE a second time just to have it on D.V.D., it does have some new footage, what Tamilee Webb calls a ""challenge segment"" where she shows you how to make some of the exercises she taught two decades ago harder to do.

As if this program had to be any harder!  Considering all the Tamilee Webb workout videos I know, BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE is hands-down the most demanding routine.  One reason, not surprisingly, it is one of the longest workout programs Tamilee's made, warm-up segment to closing stretches running more than 37 minutes.  Funny enough, the original 1991 version includes a post-closing stretch segment where Tamilee makes some of the exercise moves more difficult with a step and hand weights.  She has not done that again in any workout I know.  It's as if Tamilee knew she would one day re-release her work and wanted to have a new thing to include, like bonus tracks on a rock star's greatest hits collection.

With all this video's legs-intensive exercises and going as long as the program does, no wonder Tamilee Webb looks as fit as I've seen the girl.  Despite her curve-laden build, Tamilee's teen-ager slender in BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE, her midsection rock hard.

Then there's Tamilee Webb's two-piece workout attire, French-cut shorts and nude stockings hugging & showing off her big beautiful bottom, speaking of getting rock hard.  As(s) if that duff ain't enough, BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE might be the first video Tamilee made after getting her breast implants, and I tip my hat to the surgeon who enhanced Tamilee's figure as well as the designer of her outfit, the top she's wearing flattering the results.  Not that Tamilee needed any work, with that fine behind of hers.  I've seen clips of Tamilee's workout videos from before Ms. Buns of Steel got breasts of silicone, and with that rear I revere working for her, she has me at hello.  (Good-bye must be pretty good, too, watching Tamilee walk away.)

But(t) with all due respect to the French-cut shorts, BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE proves Tamilee Webb's breakthrough exercise tape mainly because it's such a demanding workout.  Sure, Tamilee gets cheeky via some pASSing glances of her big beautiful bottom, especially at the end (tee-hee) when she rests face down.  Between (tee-hee) this and other workouts where Tamilee's donned French-cut/thong attire and rested on her stomach, I have to say her left profile's the most flattering.  But(t) it is not until videos like THIGHS OF STEEL that Tamilee's moxie improves for even more revealing rear gear - and allowing longer looks at her sweet seat.

So with this D.V.D. reissue of BUNS OF STEEL PART THREE, Tamilee Webb is back where she started even though her backside was just getting started.",1326499200,,3342,4.7357512953367875

I ordered Volumes 1&2. Then this Classic Buns of Steel 3. Only this is the same Buns of Steel 3 work out, that is included, I believe in Volume 1. Although, I like these work out enough to keep all of them regardless of duplicate copies. Thanks for a great work out. One way to take the challenge. I'll say this before I close. Is get a work out step, to step on and off of? Raise the step a little higher.  With that you have got a real burner. Maybe, add some weights, the only reason I don't include weights, is because I'm trying not to make my muscles bigger. Also, she recommends stretch bands. When using leg stretches, from a side stretch leg lift, with the help of a stretch band? In thus adding resistance, accompanying  flexing muscles harder during this work out. However, leg stretches primarily are done laying your side from the floor. Yet, honestly, I don't own any stretchy bands for leg lifts. The Step I use in the warm up. After the warm up, the rest of the work out is mainly on the floor laying on your side, back, or front. Although, for some, these work outs could be considered exerting! If you can get through the warm up? Your gonna be good to enjoy the rest of the work out. I feel this is a nice way to sculpt and shape your Buns. If your looking to impress? You know, it's all about the Buns. This is an exciting way to shape that package that will keep them looking for awhile? I hope you enjoy these work outs. Also, this not for the faint of heart. Talk to your Doctor, if you have any questions regarding your health. Another thing listen to your body, it will tell you when you've had to much. Keep a bottle of water to hydrate your muscles, tendons, ligaments and control breathing. Important, ""Remain Hydrated.""  A good way to put that prize in your step. A work out you can feel. Results, that will make others wish they could touch. ""Ouch!"" Anyway, I feel it's a good guarantee that will keep them interested for awhile. Gotcha, ""Buns of Steel."" Have Fun!
