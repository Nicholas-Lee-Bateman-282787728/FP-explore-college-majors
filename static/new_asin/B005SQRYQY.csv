4886690,5,B005SQRYQY,"Adam 12 was always my favorite show. Although from a time long ago (can't believe we actually wore those kinds of clothes) but Malloy and Reed consistently showed what it was like to be a police officer on a daily basis. Love the cars, their constant banter. Great Jack Webb show,even better than Dragnet.",1327449600,,305,4.666666666666667
4886691,5,B005SQRYQY,"I grew up watching Adam-12 as a young boy and loved the realism that Jack Webb injected into this series.  Adam-12 did a great job of showing some of the mundane aspects of being a cop, as well as some of the adrenaline-charged moments that go into being a uniformed officer.  While the scenes sometimes harken back to an earlier, simpler time, it's neat to see LA in the early '70's.  Malloy and Reed have an interesting relationship, and they become more comedic and relaxed in the sixth series.  If you enjoy watching ""cops and robbers"" or just long for a time when police work was done the old fashioned way, this set of DVDs has your name on it!",1327190400,,650,4.391666666666667
4886692,5,B005SQRYQY,I was to young to remember watching the first episodes and caught the show when I was a little older.  I began watching them recently on HUB and loved them.  It took me back to when I was a young kid playing cops and robbers.  Maybe that's why I got the idea to be a police officer.  I bought the first season and enjoyed it some much I have bought all the others. I am eagerly waiting on Season 6 which will be coming out in January 2012.  It's been so long that I don't remember the stories so it's like watching a new show on TV.,1324944000,5,532,3.9345794392523366
4886693,5,B005SQRYQY,"Loved Adam 12 as a kid growing up in the 70's . Shouts previous releases have been good. But the long delay since the release of season 5 had me worried that this was going to be ""Ironsided"" by shout. But looks like shout is going to finnish out the series with season 6 and 7 release great news for a fun 1970's cop show classic.

Just got mine yesterday via prime 2 day shipping . Its great good video and audio but as usual for Shout release it lacks CC . Cant wait for season 7 to finnish my collection,",1318204800,8,507,4.01980198019802
4886694,5,B005SQRYQY,"Fellow Adam-12 fans:

The Shout Factory has a tentative release date listed in their catalog as December 13, 2011, which is close to Christmas.  The Shout factory website shows a late December 2011, or an early release date sometime in 2012.  This is promising news.

Like Emergency, Adam-12 was a quality show, and I know some real life police officers. I like to see police officers on TV who don't run around firing guns on a daily basis, and I never remember Reed and Malloy riding on car hoods, and I never remember Malloy pulling over an attractive young lady just to get a date.  In seven years on TV, Reed and Malloy only had four police cruisers (counting the beast).  If a real police officer went through four cars in four weeks, at the very least he would probably be assigned to foot patrol or desk detail.

Another police show I would like to see come out on DVD is Night Heat, which was a Canadian production.",1314748800,14,924,4.464285714285714
4886695,5,B005SQRYQY,"PLEASE NOTE:  This is a review created PRIOR to the release.  However, if Shout Factory does as good a job on this season as the others, the release will be a five star value as far as picture/sound/packaging and specials.  Having watched the Season 6 and 7 episodes in the past, I would recommend this season as much as the previous 5.  Adam 12 never really lost its direction or quality in its 7 year run.",1309219200,8,407,4.315789473684211
4886696,5,B005SQRYQY,This was such a good series. I learned much of the basics of poliece work from this. I did not miss all the unnecessary graphics to know what was going on. Great relationship between stars and the rest of the officers. Just enough of their personal lives to make them human but did not take away from the story of their work.,1301875200,,325,4.258064516129032

4886700,5,B005SQRYQY,"A favorite show of mine growing up in the early 70's! I was overjoyed when the discs were released but was a bit apprehensive that it might be dated like so many other shows that seemed so good when you're young but when watched as an adult, they are virtually unwatchable. This is not the case with Adam 12. My boys and I watched every episode together (that in itself is no small miracle) and they loved it ever bit as I did then and now!!
I would give this series 8 out of 5 stars, absolutely fantastic!!",1484006400,,507,4.183673469387755

4886738,5,B005SQRYQY,"I grew-up watching this great series before it was syndicated.  Once in re-runs I watched them all again.  Years later, TV Land rebroadcast them and I watched them yet again.  Fast forward, and the series was made available on DVD.  I bought them all over time and now, approaching retirement, am watching them once more.  If you lived in the era of the series it's great not only to see Malloy & Reed (Martin Milner & Kent McCord) handling all manner of police work, but take the time and look in the background shots and appreciate how different, and in many ways, better Los Angeles once was.",1394236800,3,595,4.5233644859813085
4886739,5,B005SQRYQY,Really great show that takes me back to my childhood. A precursor to Chips with the buddy cop theme. Well worth buying the whole series.,1391817600,,136,4.48

4886741,4,B005SQRYQY,"Los Angeles police Officer Pete Malloy (Martin Milner) and his hotshot rookie partner, Los Angeles police Officer Jim Reed (Kent McCord) return for another beat-blazing season of Jack Webb's police drama classic ADAM-12.

Based on real police cases in and around the city of Los Angeles, This 1973-74 Season lands these patrolmen in helicopters, on horseback and on airport patrol in locations ranging from the foothills to Venice Beach.

The boys in blue have their work cut out for them when they face teenage robbers, angry dogs, a drunken boat crook, bomb threats, armed carjackers and more.

Created by Jack Webb(Sgt. Joe Friday) as a spin-off of NBC's hit police detective series DRAGNET; ADAM-12's 6th Season delivers more gritty tales from the case vaults of 1970s Los Angeles.

These episodes on this 1973-1974 Season of ADAM-12 lets you see them complete & uncut as well as commercial free as opposed to how they were shown in reruns with all those deleted scenes with added commercial disruptions on COZI-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, and TV Land.

So now I can add this 6th Season of ADAM-12 to my DVD collection of DRAGNET, HUNTER, CHiPS, and of course my other seasons of ADAM-12 as well.

BTW, Warner Bros. will be releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1276,4.857142857142857

4886743,5,B005SQRYQY,"I chose this rating because this show is the best police show on TV other than the COPS Show, I know that Adam-12 was not a real police show like the COPS Show is but it kept me watching it and as long as it is on  channel 247 on cable I will keep watching it.",1387929600,,260,3.642857142857143
4886744,5,B005SQRYQY,"This series captures the interactions of two L.A.P.D. field officers in there daily dealings with the public.
Thanks to Jack Webb's acute attention to detail, the series is very accurate with respect to the equipment, policies and procedures of the L.A.P.D. during the late 1960's and early 1970's.",1384646400,2,298,5.229166666666667

4886758,5,B005SQRYQY,"I loved this series when I was young and I finally have the entire collection. Pete Malloy and Jim Reed have always been my favorite characters,but even then I understood what they were supposed to represent, the man on the beat,the person behind the badge. While some of what they encountered was sometimes either funny or downright serious,it was a day in the life of the police officer. It is also a bit of historical review as in some of the commentaries they explain what has changed procedurally since the time the series was made and it is interesting to hear what has changed since Adam-12 took to the road. Still, it is a great series, and one I'm glad to be seeing time and again, at least, on DVD.",1361059200,4,708,4.453846153846154

4886768,5,B005SQRYQY,"Adam-12: Season Six is every bit as good as I remember from when I watched it decades ago when it originally aired.  It's really interesting to to see how the technology has changed over the years...both in the first 6 years that it aired and from then until today.  Those poor cops had to run their buns off! Today's cops have two-ways on their person and cell phones, computers, etc., those cops had to rely on their legs and landlines!
While I like the stories about the incidents that Malloy and Reed worked on, what I really like is the camaraderie between the officers.  Martin Milner and Kent McCord have done an excellent job at portraying partners on the job and friends as well.  I'd love to have friends like them!
I can't wait until I can purchase Season Seven and I'll own the entire series!  Adam-12 is easily one of my favorite TV shows of all time.",1346544000,2,864,4.443037974683544
4886769,2,B005SQRYQY,"Shout! Factory has a long history of treating hard of hearing and deaf customers like crap, and it has reached a new low.  After providing closed captions for Seasons 1-5 of Adam-12, for some reason they abruptly *dropped* captioning from the last two seasons.

Since for almost all DVD publishers subtitles and/or closed captions are included as a matter of course, the absence of those words on an Amazon product description is no longer much of a clue to their absence in the product.  So we pretty much need to rely on reviews like these to spot the small number of outliers who refuse to support this segment of their audience.",1345334400,4,632,4.675675675675675

4886776,5,B005SQRYQY,"I own the first five seasons and like others eagerly anticipated number six. I have watched half of season six and so far it is the same great quality as the first five. This is quite refreshing since not all dvd makers put such care and effort into it. This season has some great episodes. If you are a fan of Adam 12, I definately recommend adding season six to the collection.",1327708800,,379,4.277777777777778

8485395,1,B005SQRYQY,No subtitle or caption for hearing loss and deaf!  Million of hearing loss and deaf in America!  That company already made captions from Season one to five  but  not six and seven.  They don't care about hearing loss and deaf.  I tried to talk to them and the president of company refused and he is SO GREEDY man!,1522368000,,313,4.310344827586207
