7922614,5,B00004TJG9,"This is another great Tenchi volume. We get introduced to a new character. Kiyone is Mihoshi's partner. She is the exact opposite of Mihoshi though. She's always working and cleaning up Mihoshi's mess. Because she's stuck with Mihoshi, her chances for promotion are very small. She is  very dedicated and loyal to her friends. That's my favorite thing about her. There is also an episode on this disc where the girls all open booths at a festival. It's pretty funny. Especially Ryoko's attempts at making a buck. If you haven't seen any Tenchi animes yet, this series is the best. You should definitely check it out.",1353024000,,616,4.811320754716981
7922615,5,B00004TJG9,"Tenchi Universe always cracks me up. This is probably the funniest anime that I have ever seen, and mixed with a good plot and action, you have a great series.

My favorite episode on this DVD is ""No Need For Carnivals"". It's great!",1124236800,,232,4.395348837209302
7922616,4,B00004TJG9,"Mihoshi happened to be Kiyone's partner, a partner she happily thought was dead.  But it seems that Mihoshi is very much alive and Kiyone has to go found her.  Kiyone not only finds her partner, VERY much alive, but also the wanted space pirate Ryoko living in the same HOUSE!  Kiyone tries to arrest Ryoko and, with Mihoshi's end, the fight ends up in the draw.  Soon Kiyone is drunk and telling the others all about Mihoshi's incompetence.  To her horror she and Mihoshi are assigned as Resident Officers for the solar system!  At least she still has a working spaceship.
Because the cost of living is so high and Kiyone isn't one to be a freeloader, the two officers get an apartment in the city and try to pay the bills with part-time jobs.  Between Mihoshi messing up their Earth jobs and the job of policing the solar system, the two become very, very exhausted.  Tenchi and the gang do drop by once, with food, but they wreck the place.  But not all is bad - the two like going to karaoke bars and Kiyone is starting to LIKE Mihoshi.
Then the Carnival is in town and everybody goes to either work in it, like Ryoko, Ayeka and Washu, or just enjoy it, like Sasami on a date with Tenchi.  Even Mihoshi and Kiyone are there, selling cotton candy, before the machine goes out of control.  Well, it's not Mihoshi's fault, Washu made the thing and in this series her inventions break down.  A lot.  Ryoko and Ayeka also get into a fight which only stops when the two are taken out by a flood of cotton candy.  Tenchi feels bad about the whole thing, yet in the end, Sasami really enjoyed herself.
While I gave the DVD only four points I really enjoyed episode 6, ""No Need fo Resident Officers!"", which shows Mihoshi and Kiyone trying to live in Japan.  It really does add to their characters and is somewhat touching.",1087603200,,1818,4.4174174174174174
7922617,5,B00004TJG9,"In the first espiode of this DVD, Kiyone arrives and suprised to see all the people within the Masaki Household.  Kiyone is forced to stay on Earth as Resident Officer with Mioshi.  Kiyone is one of my favorite characters.",1018310400,,222,4.666666666666667
7922618,4,B00004TJG9,"First of all for all of you parents out there this DVD doesn't have any editing on it. So you may want to watch it with your kids... Well anyway I decided to buy this DVD because I wanted to see the 'orignal' Tenchi Universe. Not the stuff I was watching on Toonami. It has the opening part on it (unlike Toonami) and the parts where if you were watching it on t.v. it has a little picture with Ryo-ohki and Ryoko. There are three different endings you can choose and you can either have it in Japenese or English. In this movie when I was watching the subbed version the song is sort of different than the dubbed one! I may be wrong but I swear it is. This DVD is about Kiyone, Mihoshi's partnre finds her and is stationed on Earth. They end up living in an aparment with tons of part-time jobs. The third one was a special one I guess. A part of the OAV or something, I dunno but the last one was sort of boring to me. There was no action whatsoever. I give it four stars because it wasn't the best action packed video i have seen for this show (my opinion). It is a must buy for Tenchi fans because it explains about Mihoshi's partner, Kiyone.",976233600,2,1146,4.120535714285714
7922619,5,B00004TJG9,"The Tenchi universe continues, In this edition Washuu becomes a prominant charactor and Mihoshis' partner Kiyone comes to rescue her, however Kiyone doesn't seem as enthusiastic as might be expected. As usual Ayeka (crown  princess of Jurai) and Ryoko (a devilish space pirate with super-human  powers) continue to compete for Tenchi's love in this hilarious series.",961804800,2,366,5.517857142857143
7922620,5,B00004TJG9,"The Tenchi Universe series was the first TV series of Tenchi ever released. It basically retells the story of the OVAs, only in a slightly different order and fashion. Universe is great, and best of all, where  sadly the OVA series was never completed, the Universe series has a  definite beginning, middle, and end. And it's incredible. Buy it, watch it,  and enjoy it. This is some great anime.",961804800,4,396,4.7101449275362315
