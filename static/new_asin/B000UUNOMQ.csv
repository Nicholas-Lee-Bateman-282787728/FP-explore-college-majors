8214880,4,B000UUNOMQ,"Ippo Makunouchi fulfills his dream in becoming a boxer. He manages to not only win The Japan Rookie of the Year Tournament but he also faced and defeated another Rookie of the Year winner from another region by the name of Takeshi Sendo. Now with new motivation, Ippo later sets his sight on the Japan Featherweight Championship. Will the young boxer be able to fulfill his dream? -summary

For those unaware, Fighting Spirit is a 75 episode anime series that follows the character of Ippo whom found a passion in boxing after being saved by another rising boxer by the name of Takamura. He goes on to set his goals in boxing, and then attempts to balance his boxing life with school and helping out his mother. He eventually finds his way into the ring and rivalries are created as he advances through the Japan Rookie Tournament.  This second volume continues his journey.

Fighting Spirit: Complete Collection 2 contains episodes 41 - 75 and a feature movie titled Champion Road. I have mentioned before that Fighting Spirit aka Hajime No Ippo is among my favorite anime series, and I even regard it as my favorite fighting anime.  These feelings are still the same as it really is a very good series, however, very good is about as far as it can go with me; although it manages to work as an entertaining series on many levels, it does have rather annoying flaws that effected my enjoyment. The movie Champion Road also suffers from these ailments on a greater level and at times was tough to watch.

The plot follows Ippo as he trains consistently and goes through more boxers on his way to meet Japan's Featherweight Champion Eiji Date. The story also continues to delve deeper into the world of boxing, as it provides a summary on some of the injuries a boxer may face from taking too many blows, family issues getting into the way, and even the very large fall in the rankings a boxer must try and overcome when faced with a single defeat or multiple losses. Some of the characters have spent at least 4 years trying to get a title fight, and if they should lose their entire careers will likely go up in smoke in a blink of an eye.  The art of boxing and some of its history is mildly explored, as different tactics are brought to light such as the infamous Dempsey Roll and punching feints.

Directed and written by Satoshi Nishimura and Tatsuhiko Urahata, respectively, Fighting Spirit has areas where it is done really well in regards to its drama and soft humor. The characters are likable enough with realistic drives and I hardly ever found myself wanting anyone to just go away. I will also give further credit to the writing on many details in explaining portions of boxing to those unfamiliar with the sport. The writing gives off the feel as if this anime is for everyone, and it can actually motivate someone into taking up some kind of physical activity or even learning more about certain people involved in the sport whom are mentioned.

Unfortunately, the writing is also one of the series downfalls, but this all depends on who you talk to. The character development seems to have gotten stale by this point and the characters never really break their molds. Ippo is a real problem here; one would think that after at least 10 fights including championship bouts and facing an opponent he defeated before, his confidence would be sky high. However, no such luck as he continues doubting himself and he just doesn't feel too realistic anymore. This is simply the writers sacrificing character for the sake of drama. This has worked for some people's enjoyment, but I began to get annoyed with Ippo's self-defeating attitude. He should have been long pass this stage to doubt himself on such a dreadful level. I understand pressure but this was just ridiculous.

I'm also not too fond of how characters struggles are captured either.  At times, everything seems so easy for Ippo's rivals and future opponents as they destroy competition. There's not a lot of explanation behind their strategies and character development is shaky for a lot of them. They seem to live more for the plot than actually telling an engrossing story. Their matches are so rushed when compared to their encounters with Ippo. Of course, fans of the series will likely point out Ippo being the star so he deserves the complete focus. If that's their case then I recommend they watch Baki the Grappler, as almost every fighter in that series receives some form of focus down to their personalities, styles, and even action segments. I'm not saying Baki the Grappler is better, but it does excel in this one area though.

The production values are still pretty high as the animation during the fight scenes still delivers some amazing action sequences. There are plenty of high impact blows with a clever use of reused cels, and some nice choreography. The sound effects help out a great deal in bringing the action to life, as the viewer will be able to feel some of these beatings. The BGM once again compliments the action and humor rather well, and I still enjoy both the sub and dub; personally I prefer the English cast simply due to some of the dialog and acting being drop dead funny.

In closing, Fighting Spirit is an enjoyable anime that I can still sit back and watch after owning it for several years. Despite its flaws there isn't a single episode I can skip. The movie is pretty much more of the same thing and the flaws in the series are more prominent here. I'll go so far to say this movie shouldn't have been made. It isn't bad, it just doesn't introduce anything new nor does Ippo grow at all as a character. In any case,  more than likely I will forever keep this in my collection and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good anime title with great action and solid storytelling.

Pros: High production values, enjoyable cast of characters, amazing fight sequences

Cons: Shaky moments in writing",1428192000,,5927,4.663793103448276

8214882,5,B000UUNOMQ,"This anime was ""awe"" inspiring, as you watch the entire series from start to finish you will see a boy growing up learning to box originally was a hobby, but turned into a passion.  The characters that add to the story are all compelling, worthwhile, and attribute to the rich environment of the story line.

8214884,5,B000UUNOMQ,"If you're a boxing fan, you'll love this anime. The fights are entertaining and you'll love the characters. The anime is very well paced and only has a couple of filler episodes. Part 2 also includes the Champion Road movie which is an excellent bonus.",1218499200,,252,4.622222222222222

The only aspect that I found a little worse in this set of episodes was that in a couple of cases we get fights that drag on too long. The problem is not as noticeable as in other sports anime, but it is prominent enough to make me take half a star away.

Everything else is just outstanding, and this is still the best anime out there. Ippo is now starting his journey towards the Japanese title and in the process he will face new and challenging opponents. The humor in the series, mainly provided by the ""three stooges"", Takamura, Kimura and Aoki, is still going strong and always provides an enjoyable break from the action. On a different front, I really liked the fact that there are episodes completely focused on other characters, such as Kimura and Aoki. This definitely helps with preventing us from getting bored. The dramatic aspects of the series are more prominent, with Ippo's mother suffering from exhaustion and generating guilty feelings in Ippo, who has neglected the business. Finally, romantic scenes are more frequent and blended well with the humor.

This set of DVDs, also includes the TV Special&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fighting-Spirit-Champion-Road-TV-Special/dp/B000J4QWLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fighting Spirit - Champion Road TV Special</a>, so you do not have to purchase that separately. If you are a fan of the series, like I am, then be aware that the story continues well beyond what you can see in these DVDs. The manga is still going in Japan, with 81 volumes at the time of this review, and the anime only covers until volume 35. Sadly, the manga has not yet been published in English, so the only alternative for those who want to see how the story continues is to get the scanlations online (just in case, the name of the series is Hajime no Ippo). Hopefully, if more people start showing interest in this series the manga will get to the English markets soon!",1200096000,7,2341,5.446280991735537
