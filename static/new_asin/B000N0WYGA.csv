2752578,1,B000N0WYGA,"Did not expect this sad selection of anti-heroes who may be either victims or enablers to plots that consistently defy justice.
The production and acting is of good English quality but is not enough to overcome these sorry stories.
There is sufficient sex or sex related violence in each episode to satisfy those voyeuristically inclined.
The price of this collection is too high, after watching half of the shows I said enough and have put it a way forever.",1291334400,2,458,4.810126582278481
2752579,5,B000N0WYGA,"I have only watched two of the collection so far but have been delighted with those two.  One thing that is very nice touch is that each mystery is in three parts.  Therefore, one is able to watch for an hour, or two or three

I have only watched the first two mysteries in the collection.  I am delighted with those and would highly recommend them to anyone who likes Ruth Rendell and or English Mysteries.
One nice touch is that each story is divided into three parts so one is able to watch for an hour or two or three, as time allows.
These mysteries are so compelling that I believe I may have ""hooked"" my husband into watching them with me. No easy task, taking him away from Football!!!",1286236800,2,693,4.267175572519084
2752580,5,B000N0WYGA,"I rented all of these sets (and loved all of them) and am now thrilled to be able to buy them together at a discounted price. I understand some of the frustration from folks who've purchased these sets indivudally at much higher prices but it's not uncommon for distributors to combine sets together in a ""complete"" package of everything they have available after marketing them individually. As others have mentioned, this does not purport to be an all-encompassing collection of either Wexford or Rendell mysteries - it is simply (and as advertised) a ""Ruth Rendell Mysteries Collection"". If you don't already own these sets, this is an amazing bargain. If you do - you obviously enjoy them, so why give this great compilation only one star? It seems unfair to mislead others into thinking that these are second- or third- rate productions when they are anything but that.....",1280793600,12,878,4.9391891891891895
2752581,5,B000N0WYGA,"This isn't a ""complete"" collection and doesn't claim to be - and it's not an Inspector Wexford Collection either. Acorn can't release titles for which they do not own the rights. This is simply a pull-together of the previously released ""Ruth Rendell Mysteries"" which is exactly what it claims to be and is not an unusual practice in the DVD industry. I don't understand how it being what it says it is merits a one star rating. The rating should be based on what the set is and not what it isn't.",1274659200,38,497,4.413043478260869
2752582,1,B000N0WYGA,"I can appreciate a re-release/more copies made when they are still selling them and there aren't any others available or they are in demand and haven't been available for years.  However, I too am sick of the idiot dvd companies picking and choosing to spend money on things are widely available in another format or thinner boxes or the same freakin' seasons in a slimmer package or a fatter package or a full set of what's already currently available or wasting money on blu-ray releases when clearly DVD is not going away - no offense - I don't care if they do both - but they are making every effort to do away with dvd even when we clearly want shows on dvd.......wasting money time after time and pretending it wouldn't be financially viable to release what we want in it's original form...while fans await so very many series and the rest of the episodes of so many series - whether British Mysteries that I love or other old shows that I love and were partially released eons ago and never completed or disappeared into a vault and were never even considered for release no matter how many fans want them.

I am fed up with basically EVERYONE in the business-in every country!",1268870400,6,1184,4.553990610328638
2752583,1,B000N0WYGA,"I agree, there is no reason for this release.  It is just a rehash of previous US DVD releases.  It is not a true ""Ruth Rendell"" collection, as it omits the UK broadcast episodes ""Talking to Strange Men"", ""The Strawberry Tree"". ""Heartstones"" and ""Thornapple"". It also fails, as it includes episodes 21-23 of the ""Inspector Wexford"" mysteries, all previously issued several times, but again ignores the first 20 episodes of this great series.  So... Acorn has re-released the same 17 DVDs they and others released before and still haven't released the other 24 episodes that were shown on UK tv.  BIG WHOOP!",1265414400,30,606,4.911764705882353
2752584,1,B000N0WYGA,"It's a shame so much production time and money is spent re-releasing the same ole material.  It's obvious the Rendell series are in high demand, just read the reviews!! Since all British mystery series are high in demand on dvd and the Wexford tv series is long overdue for release, you'd think Acorn would spend money more wisely and boost their sales by releasing NEW material and stop dropping us in it with incomplete series releases.",1264464000,18,438,4.7631578947368425
2752585,4,B000N0WYGA,Some are better than others.  Sometimes Rendell is a bit noir for my taste.  But I really like Inspector Wexford.,1415059200,2,113,4.6

2752588,5,B000N0WYGA,"These have received mixed reviews, but I think each one is stellar. I have to admit my favorite is May and June; Phoebe Nicholls is just so brilliant in it. I also enjoyed seeing a young Colin Firth (God, he just keeps getting better, doesn't he?!!) I have watched each and enjoyed each.",1394150400,2,287,4.433962264150943

2752590,1,B000N0WYGA,"I purchased this some time back. I am a huge Ruth Rendell fan and looked forward to watching the mysteries I'd loved in print. However the set I received literally was missing half the stories. FOr instance I received one disk with the first half of ""Simisola"" and another with the second of ""Road Rage"" I have no idea whether this happened just to this set or only to me.",1373241600,2,372,4.328571428571428
2752591,5,B000N0WYGA,"Have enjoyed these movies tremendously.  a great collection, with a solid performances by a wide range of seasoned British actors.",1372032000,5,130,5.5
2752592,4,B000N0WYGA,"Ruth Rendell's fiction is classified as mystery fiction, but most of her books are better described as psychological suspense.  In addition to her superb prose style, she has a unique talent for creating odd, quirky characters that may not be completely believable ... but we still recognize parts of ourselves in them.

These British TV adaptations do not, in general, do justice to the source material.  There are several changes to the stories which don't seem to have any purpose, and they have a rather slapdash feel about them.  They are dumbed down.

However, they are still (mostly) pretty entertaining, unless you're looking for a cozy ""puzzle"" mystery of the Agatha Christie school.  Rendell's stories are not Colonel-Mustard-in-the-library-with-the-candlestick tales, but are much darker.  Since there is little of this kind of fiction on TV or on film, it's nice to have these, at least until someone improves upon them.",1369526400,7,932,5.214765100671141
2752593,3,B000N0WYGA,"My father used to say, ""When the your life gets crazy and chaotic and feels out of control, read a good murder mystery and it will put everything back to order.""

I laughed then but now see his wisdom: The only reality is what we choose to perceive.  My discovery of the murder mysteries of British writer Ruth Rendell - especially the inspector Wexford stories -- has only reinforced my dad's wise words: A good detective makes sense of the apparent chaos.

Rendell, who will be 81 in February, has for over 40 years created stories of insightful psychological behavior as well as believable plots with wicked ironies and startling twists.  Her dark tales nicely reflect the social and technological changes of the last decades.
Earlier this year, Acorn Media released an 11-volume DVD set, ""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries Collection"" that features 17 full-length mysteries based on her award-winning fiction. The series aired on public television in the 90's. (Sadly, only three of them are Inspector Wexford tales -- I think 23 Wexford stories have been produced).
Volume 1: ""Master of the Moor,"" ""Vanity Dies Hard,"" ""The Secret House of Death"" and ""The Double.""  Each titles runs about two and a half hours.

Volume 2: ""Bribery & Corruption,"" ""Front Seat,"" ""A Case of Coincidence"" and ""A Dark Blue Perfume,"" ""May & June"" and a favorite ""The Orchard Walls' -- set during the London blitz, 16-year-old Jenny is sent from London to live with her mother in the country where she senses disturbing and deadly secrets among her reserved relatives.
Volume 3: ""Going Wrong,"" ""Harm Done,"" and another favorite ""The Fallen Curtain"" -- as a boy, Richard Clayton was abducted, but he can't remember what happened during the brief terror.  The mystery haunts him until he reaches the brink of manhood. This is a terrific psychological mystery with a resolution that remains elusive.  Also ""Lake of Darkness"" and ""You Can't Be Too Careful"" the latter titles each with run times of about two and a half hours.

Set 4: ""Simisola"" (two and a half hours) and ""Road Rage"" (almost three and a half hours).
The Rendell collection provides almost 30 hours of engaging English murder mysteries that are perfect to loll away a nippy winter weekend.  Extras are minimal, but there is a nice widescreen feature (all the other titles are full frame) ""Super Sleuths: Inspector Wexford.""  Let's hope a complete collection of Rendell's Wexford stories is on the horizon from Acorn.",1299801600,15,2451,4.9391727493917275
8173890,1,B000N0WYGA,"The real problem with this series and any other regarding Ruth Rendell is that Acorn or any other has not put any Wexford Mysteries except for three:  Road Rage, Simisola, and Harm Donethe last three Inspector Wexford Mysteries that were filmed.  And from what Acorn told me, there are no plans for the remaining Wexford mysteries to be put to DVD much less to BVD.  At least not any time soon.  My guess is that Acorn does not believe that the demand across the pond and in the US would not be high enough to cover the cost of paying royalties, etc.",1513555200,,550,4.362745098039215

8173892,1,B000N0WYGA,"I love Ruth Rendel - I thought - I have some of her audio mystery books and enjoy them.  These however are something else.  I can't tell what the problem is - did the producers poorly translate her work to screen - weird shows where there are no heros and everybody dies, shows that end like an incomplete thought and you what???

8173894,5,B000N0WYGA,"We have started buying these types of BBC Series/Collections because my wife & I have gotten quite taken away with British TV
& /Movies. We watch so much that I buy by the pound now, as I like to call it, lol.. If I find an affordable collection that sounds half way decent and it has 800- 1600 minuets of play, I buy it. This long Series was just what we needed. Each short story has a serious, well thought out plot that we don't always figure it out at first. Many times we have had to wait to the end of the program when the aAuthor decides to let us know. She will keep you guessing who died it all right! I was very surprised at how good these episodes were, truly. She will keep you enrolled to the very end of each & every episode! When I first got it, I thought I might just watch one or tow and save the pst to watch lat in the evening hours...WRONG! When i started watching I watched almost 1/2 the collection. Each & every one a  Masterpiece! I can honestly recommend this Fine Collection to anyone! Enjoy! My copy and others will soon be for sale if interested?",1481932800,,1074,4.138755980861244
