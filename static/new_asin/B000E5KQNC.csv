8105816,5,B000E5KQNC,"Writer/star Jacob Faust and director Eric Leiser, using the conceit of the former's surname as starting off point, have taken the Faust legend, going back to it's earliest source, the so-called Faustbuch, and brought it into the 21st Century through imaginative avant-garde use of cinema verite style (such as using Jacob's actual job as mortician for his screen job), formal narrative (such as scenes with Margarite), puppetry (good and bad angels) and surrealism (Faustus' encounters with the supernatural). The artistry is also evident in how the filmmakers have used their meager budget to propel their creativity rather than hinder it.
This story has been on the screen since the beginning of film, with such pioneers as Georges Melies, Alice Guy and Edwin S. Porter leading the way, followed by others in the silent era, most notably in F.W. Murnau's masterpiece. Faust's sound film career started off slowly till the end of WWII, then making a comeback, mostly in Europe, he has been on the screen ever since, from the comic to the dramatic to the surreal to film versions of operas to a rock opera to low-budget horror films to Underground films, and even a porn film.
Faust is a Western archetype who can represent the search for knowledge, especially ""forbidden"" knowledge, for imaginative artists. And this is what Faust and Leiser have focused on, having the ""pact with the devil"" just one tool to this end.",1288569600,5,1419,4.991561181434599
8105817,5,B000E5KQNC,"Faustus (Jacob Faust) is a mortician on a quest for truth, an odyssey that sinks him further into his work. But each step he takes toward accessing the dark recesses of his mind brings him closer the devil, who offers him knowledge in exchange for his soul. This experimental feature is based on the classic German tale of Dr. Faust, as popularized in literature by Christopher Marlowe and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.",1282176000,2,417,4.805555555555555
8105818,1,B000E5KQNC,"This is a silly, high-school-level comedy that is dishonestly advertised as something serious instead.  Much of the time you will see the corny actor just walking about.  Maybe in a field, maybe among trees, maybe drinking beer, etc.  He reads his lines like the guy who stands up to read whatever the teacher tells him to read and doesn't care at all about doing it.  The audience is expected to be duped into believing the nonsense is deep and artistic by the use of angle-shots and people sitting on benches wearing masks and disconnected scenes that have no thread of continuity and other transparent such.  I've seen a lot of movies but this is the worst I've ever seen.  I actually fast-forwarded it to see if there was any interesting action ahead.  I never had the desire to do such a thing before.  What an amateurish effort.",1268870400,,834,4.625850340136054
8105819,1,B000E5KQNC,"Jacob Faust had a tumultuous back and forth w/ the filmmakers of this film.  He had abandoned the project when he knew it wasn't going to fulfill his vision.  He never provided the ending of his script to the Leiser brothers.  You can tell.  Jake felt this was not going in the direction he wanted and gave up on it.

Leisers sold this on that premise and trys to pretend they will ""donate"" the money to his family currently seeking justice for wrongful death.  They capitalized on Jake's untimely killing to promote other film endeavors.",1207180800,3,538,4.610526315789474
8105820,4,B000E5KQNC,"""Faustbook"" is an extreme character study that will shock you and leave you in awe. It's from first time filmmaker Eric Leiser, who shows real skill behind the camera. It's also written by its star Jacob Faust, who passed away in April of 2005. He's also the composer of the film. All of this really adds to the tone and mood of the film. The film is also presented in black and white. I think the black and white presentation is perfectly suited for a film of this nature. It's the type of that film really surrounds you in its style. You are really absorbed by everything that is happening on screen. With that said, this is a very strange film. At certain points, I was not sure if I really liked it. It's very strange Eventually, I learned to just go with the total weirdness and strangeness of the film. You have to accept it. If not, you'll go crazy trying to figure out the film.

The film follows Faustus, who is a troubled mortician with a lot of questions. He's trying to find some truth behind his job. It's almost like the film ""Sideways,"" but set in a funeral home. In ""Sideways,"" you had two guys looking for some truth behind the wine that they drink. In this film, you have a man looking for truth behind his profession. He also must encounter the devil, who offers him answers for his soul. Not exactly what I would call a fair trade. Now, I have a lot of questions about life, but I'm not going this far to find them. He is starting to wonder if he needs his questions answered that badly. He has one last chance to save himself before the deal is finally signed with the devil. The devil does not enjoy people who don't follow their contract. He's not exactly understanding or patient. Either you follow his deals, or you perish promptly.

As stated above, all of this is really weird and out there. Can you accept the premise of the film? That's the question you should ask yourself before checking out this film. I was able to because it was so different from anything that I had ever seen. You won't be bored watching this film. It's weirdly fascinating and bizarre. To make the film even weirder, it has a lot of dark humor in it. Jacob Faust must have been a very interesting individual in real life. He sure has a unique and dark vision with this film. He would have been an interesting filmmaker in the years to come. His work is all over this film in terms of acting, directing, and even composing. Are you tired of the same old Indy films? You won't find anything boring or predictable in this film. You'll find some unique film-making in this strange flick. You just have to make sure you are ready and prepared for such bizarre fare. If not, you'll be lost throughout the course of this film.

 ""Faustbook"" is a film that I think will polarize audiences right down the middle. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the usual Indy films that seem to be inspired by Kevin Smith. It had its own style and tone. If you are a film fan who takes chances, check out this film.
