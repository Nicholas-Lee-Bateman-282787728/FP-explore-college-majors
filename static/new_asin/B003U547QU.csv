8405657,5,B003U547QU,"Julie puts her heart into everything she does because she cares about the most important gift we have next to our children - our health.  Max's Minutes combines Julie's great loves: her son and her passion to make us all healthier. I have known and worked with Julie for years, she wants for my son and your children what she wants for her son Max - health and health abundantly. That's why she asks us all to take a minute and focus on what really matters!  I love taking time out for Max's Minutes and ""trying"" to keep up with all that Julie knows about eating right - no one does it better!",1278633600,,593,4.238938053097345
