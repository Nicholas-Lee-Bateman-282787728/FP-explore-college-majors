3797302,5,B001U7NVWQ,"As a family, we have been watching Thomas shows since he was on Shining Time Station back in the 1980s.  We have enjoyed listening to Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and Pierce Brosnan reading the stories and doing all the voices.  However, nothing had prepared us for this one!  On this DVD, the characters are all computer animated!  It says nothing about it on the DVD package!  I have heard people say they bought The Great Discovery or the theatrical movie because they heard that the trains' mouths move in those shows.  THIS is the one you're looking for, folks!  Our older children found it ""weird"", and I admit that it was a little disconcerting after all these years (and I still think Sir Topham Hatt doesn't look right), but our youngest son absolutely loves it, and that's all that matters!",1262476800,12,812,4.676056338028169
3797303,5,B001U7NVWQ,"Our 3 y/o grandson is really into Trains. Big trains, model trains and toy trains. All Thomas purchases we have made have been enjoyed and offered hours of entertainment for him. Thomas is not only entertaining but softly presents good lessons for getting along in life.

3797306,5,B001U7NVWQ,My grandson loves the Thomas shows. Can not say much else. It is his favorite thing in the world.....,1406592000,,101,4.368421052631579
3797307,4,B001U7NVWQ,"Our two year old grandson watched this today and enjoyed it. As far as I know, this was his first experience with watching Thomas and Friends. We will watch more of these in the future. Grandma liked that it was non-violent; that, even though Thomas made mistakes, he learned from them; that friendship and helping friends (and accepting help from friends) was a recurring theme. Seems to be entertaining for the two to five year old age range.",1397520000,,444,4.705128205128205

3797311,5,B001U7NVWQ,"If your kids love Thomas and his friends from the island of Sodor as much as my grandson, these being on the Prime streaming make it more than worth the yearly cost.
There are a few episodes...not necessarily around a common theme or anything...with some live-action scenes in between.

Highly recommended.",1390176000,,306,5.0
3797312,5,B001U7NVWQ,"My grandson Jordan simply loves these dvd's! They keep him interested and the content is wholesome and non-violent, which is needed to help develop our kids minds toward something that is of good, moral character. Wonderful for all little minds!",1388793600,2,245,5.15
