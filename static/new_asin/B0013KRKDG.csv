8251572,3,B0013KRKDG,"This is a fairly good overview of Marshall's career.

That being said, there are some oversights:

Marshall's relationships and/or opinions of some of the major egos of the period - Patton and MacArthur - is not mentioned.

Not mentioned was that Marshall's plan for troop replacement in Europe at the end of the war was highly criticized for excessive casualties - you need to reference&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Soldiers-The-U-S-Army-from-the-Normandy-Beaches-to-the-Bulge-to-the-Surrender-of-Germany/dp/0684848015/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Soldiers: The U. S. Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany</a>&nbsp;for detail.

Marshall's strong opposition to Truman's decision to recognize Israel in 1948 is not mentioned at all.

Marshall's relationship with Eisenhower could have benefited from more discussion. Eisenhower criticized the Marshall plan and cozied up with Joe McCarthy during the 1952 campaign. He failed to rebuke McCarthy's false slanders of Marshall. See - [...].

The bonus material is almost worth the price of the DVD. Called FDR-The War Years - it has some of the best quality newsreel footage of FDR during the period. If you have read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FDR-s-Deadly-Secret/dp/1586487442/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FDR's Deadly Secret</a>- it points out that FDR had melanoma - and the tumor is clearly visible above FDR's left eyebrow in the newsreel footage. Also, FDR's decline is obvious in the newsreels of the later years.",1272240000,,1606,6.55188679245283
