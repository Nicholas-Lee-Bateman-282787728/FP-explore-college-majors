2100812,4,B0002KQOH6,"It really is a shame that this dvd did not have a commentary track by director Andrei Zvyagintsev .  I would love to know how a first time director can take less than $500,000 and turn it into something as beautiful and haunting as this.  There are tons of directors out there who will work their whole careers and never come close to making a movie as good as Zvyagintsev has here and in Russia no less!  I'd also like to know more about the death of Vladimir Garin who drown soon after shooting was finished, but I'm getting ahead of myself....

Two teenage boys are surprised one day at the unannounced return of their father who has been gone for 12 years.  He is a man of few words and strangely enough on his second day back he takes the boys out the road for a ""three"" day fishing trip.

Things quickly go downhill as the father's intensions are as unknown as their destination.  He is cruel to both of the boys to the point that it looks like he is trying to make them into ""men"" overnight or break their spirits for something more sinister.

The eldest boy, Andrey (the one who drown in real life) wants to love his father, but is conflicted by his father's brutality and his love for his younger brother who is openly bitter about the father's absence.

I'm not going to give away the whole story.  It's better to let the tense mount, but I will tell you to watch the youngest brother played by Ivan Dobronravov.  That kid can act!  He make the boy from THE SIXTH SENSE look like the red-headed geek from ""Different Strokes"".",1101427200,33,1535,4.347368421052631
2100813,5,B0002KQOH6,"I've seen many emotional films in my life, but I've never seen a film with as much emotional intensity as Vozvrashcheniye. Even though I don't know what it is like to have a distance or missing parent, I feel I've suffered the same feelings that other children in this situation must have.

The emotional content of the film continues if you watch the documentary on the making of the film included in the DVDs extras. This is no ordinary film; the feelings of the director, the cinematographer, the producer, and the personal experiences of each of the actors; words cannot describe the heart every single person put into this film. The insufficiency of words can also be described by the film itself -there isn't a heavy amount of dialogue, and there doesn't need to be (even though for the majority of the film you're screaming at the characters to say something!). To quote from Fyodor Dostoyevsky (a Russian author): ""there is immeasurably more left inside than what comes out in words.""

This little review doesn't do justice to the film for the same reason. It is for this reason, this insufficiency that words have, why films (like this one) need to be created.",1101168000,7,1169,4.753694581280788

At his return, the boys go with him on a one-day fishing trip that turns into four days on more than a fishing trip, but what it was I do not know. The entire movie was a mystery to me. A beautifully delivered mystery but still vague in its message.

The entire film seemed stark, bare, and especially raw in appearance. Of course, the photography in the film was muted in gray, black, and white with the occasional green and blue. The visual aspects of the film lend its self well to the underlying loneliness and despair while capitalizing on the aggression between the children and their father.

Beautifully filmed in wonderful locations with talented actors, the movie had potential if only it had a plot with a message.

If you watch this film be prepared to wonder. There were so many directions this film could go but it didn't go anywhere. I walked away wondering what happened and why.

2100815,5,B0002KQOH6,"""The Return"" is one of the best movies to have recently come out of Russia.  Director Andrei Zvyagintsev, who has been compared to Tarkovsky by quite a few critics, does a wonderful job, and so do the three main actors Konstantin Lavronenko (the father) and Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov (as Andrey and Vanya, the sons).

The movie opens with the two brothers running.  They play on the windy lakeshore with their friends, jumping off a tower into the dark water.  The younger boy is too scared to jump, but too reluctant to climb down for fear of being branded a chicken.  When his worried mom ultimately finds him, he declares that he would have died up there if she hadn't.  Life flows by as usual.  It changes when the brothers come back home one day and their mom whispers to them, ""Be quiet, your father is sleeping"".  Their father (with suggested links to the Russian mafia) had not been home in the last twelve years and their only recollections about him are from an old black and white photograph.  He plans a weeklong fishing trip with the kids to get to know them again.  He is a stranger to them, and in contrast to their mother, is someone who doesn't tolerate childhood tantrums and sulking and wants them to grow up and learn to deal with life the hard way.  The younger boy has a miserable time, while the elder one is torn between suspicion and the desire to bond with his father.  They eventually start out for an island and when the boat's motor splutters and stops, their dad makes them row.  Exhausted, they reach the island ... it is here under the grey skies that the story reaches its unexpected climax.

Throughout the movie the atmosphere is gloomy and the dialogue is sparse.  The movie was shot in the Siberian pine forests near the border of Russia and Finland, and the overcast sky and the drizzle work to complement the sombre moods of the characters.  A lot of what the audience carries away from the movie are only suggested and never explicitly mentioned.  At the end of it, we realize that we know hardly anything about the characters that we had been following for the past 105 minutes other than watching their emotions at play.  All these work together to transform this thriller into an unsettling psychological study seeped in Russian mysticism.",1099094400,59,2292,4.617283950617284

The Return Directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev

Film review by Monserrat Martinez

September 5, 2004

The film opens with young Russian boys daring each other to jump off the tower into the cold lake. The last of the boys decided not to jump and is left alone by his brother and calls him ""chicken"".

The two fatherless brothers from a Russian town, Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov), are engaged in a brotherly fight the next day and chase after each other to tell their mother. They then learn of their father's (Konstantin Lavronenko) sudden return home after twelve years.

The mysterious father takes his sons to a fishing trip and their mother reluctantly accepts them to go with their father. Andrei, the oldest, is willing to please his father and dearly calls him ""papa"" while Vanya, the youngest and most stubborn, resents his father's return. The trip engages in different confrontations between the father and his sons as well as between the brothers. We learn of Andrei's weakness in peer pressure and Vanya's rebel character. The viewer's immediately recognize the father's strong character and violent punishments, but a ""godlike"" figure to the boys. Andrei says to his brother ""did you see him. He is big, he probably works out"" during their last night before leaving for the trip.

The many confrontations between Vanya and his father conveys the ""toughen up"" and military background of the father and ways of punishing his rebel son Vanya - leaving him alone in the rain with the fishing rods. Later on the ""favoured"" son, Andrei is physically abused by banging his son's face on the car during the car trouble.

The climatic point of the film starts with Vanya's grand plan to steal his father's knife and confession to Andrei of his feelings and hatred towards their father. A disaster is bound to happen, as the day gets darker and windy. (A tragic recently happened to the young actor Vladimir Garin just after finishing the film when he had drowned in a swimming accident similar to the beginning of the film.)

Pleasing to the eye as the landscape of Russia, during the spring, blooms in the father-son trip. Visualizing the serene images of the boys' faces during the calm waters to their stern faces during the stormy weather.

Somehow Vanya's decisiveness to prove his courage by climbing up the tower and the fear in his father for his son's safety creeps an uncomfortable thrill to the viewers. The morose consequences change the young boys' character and personality.

The 39-year-old Russian director's, Mr. Zvyagintsev, creation to demonstrate the moving tension and simplicity of his characters evokes a psychological thrill. There are some biblical metaphors or inferences, but that is to judge only to the viewer's own opinion. The sacred relationship between father and son eludes the mysterious persona of the father's mission to get the box and taking his innocent sons with him arose more mystery. ""The Return"" completes itself as a wonderful film filled with human actions with reasonable thoughts. A new talent has arrived from this independent Russian film.",1094342400,21,3531,4.988095238095238
2100819,4,B0002KQOH6,"Having heard in advance that the director is a devotee of Tarkovsky, I was expecting to be baffled, and was, at least in part.  At first watching, the movie comes across as ""National Lampoon's Siberian Vacation"", but I don't think that was the intention! Some things I wish I had been told before seeing it... pay attention to the days of the week (there's evidently some sort of Passion of Christ symbolism going on).

The father character was well portrayed by the Russian actor, and it was obvious that this man did have a certain type of love for his sons.  He seemed to me to be a mariner, and I keep thinking that the business he was attending to when he journeyed with his sons to an isolated island was contained in the small metal box which he dug up out of the ground while on the island.  I felt more empathy for the father, and the behavior of his sons, particularly Ivan, infuriated me.

2100828,5,B0002KQOH6,"I have this foreign film in my DVD collection as an excellent example of mysticism from a Russian point of view.  The Russian producer, Andrei Tarkovsky, provides insight to the Russian Society with Karl Jung type of landscape as a counterculture that caves into the rage, loss and abstract redemption of a Freudian nature.  This film portrays the emotional vacuum of fatherless childhood in which two young Brothers - Ivan and Andrei have never known mysteriously returns.  During a Russian Summer, both boys get in their alleged Father's auto for a fishing trip.  In a frenzy, both Boys crave the need to believe this mysterious man is really their Father.  However, in the Russian Wilderness the vacation morphs into a nightmare of Father-Sons love-like triangle testing their resolves with inexplicable violence.  The boys start to perceive this man may try to harm, exploit or even kill them like a male specie that kills its cubs out of a warped, distorted affection?!

The mysterious figure of the boys' father and his purely erratic behavior (with no clue to the viewer as to why he was acting that way, other than being mentally sick or just a completely careless father) stripped the movie of any sense of drama. Sure real life is filled with this kind of drama, but I didn't think the whole story would have needed to be immortalized in cinematography.

A harsh father who makes promises only to dismiss them; who finds his sons always short of expectations; who's irritation at the unmet expectations leads to an attempt to break both sons' spirit.  Although that sounds very bleak, this story leaves you with enough questions to blunt the bleakness: where was ""Dad?""  Will they being an ""aha!"" moment where everyone loves everyone--or even close?  The father clearly has a purpose for this trip, but what?

2100851,5,B0002KQOH6,"Rarely do we see a movie this brave and this true to life!  I have given many movies that I enjoy 5 stars.  This movie probably deserves 5 stars more than any movie.

This movie offers no apologies for the flaws in the main characters.  It does not try to oversimplify the things that we do not understand.  Instead, it leaves us shrouded in the mysteries of a man's past while allowing us to glimpse at the future through the lens of ""right here right now"".

A father returns after 12 years of hiatus and embarks on a treacherous journey in North Russia with his two young sons.  He is a stranger to them as they are to him.  The older son wants to idolize his father while the youngest has hard questions and resentments.  The resentments and questions persist throughout the movie and boil over into a very unexpected climax.

If you watch this movie and are disappointed because the mysteries haunt you and you think it is an incidental flaw,you might be wrong.  I suspect that the director and the writers intended this movie to be life-like.  Hardly do we get real answers in life.  And rarely are the answers satisfying anyways.  So why not focus on the present and the future?  Is it not where lies our potential for change?

Change does happen for this strange and mysterious man who comes to claim his sons.  If he thought it would be easy to show up and pick up from where he left off, he is seriously wrong.  These boys are boys and as such rebellious and lacking male guidance.  If he thought parenting is about bullying the boys into obedience, he is again wrong.  And he finds out soon enough that parenting takes dedication, concern, charisma, love and foresight.

The boys too will go through major transformations as they are subjected to the whims of their mysterious father.  He teaches them hard skills to survive in the wilderness.  He would have taught them to drive and to fight and to look out for one another.  He would have whipped them into early manhood and they will be all the better for it.

This movie teaches us that life is a mystery and perhaps it is best that way.  And there are blessings in disguise as well.",1445644800,2,2147,4.455012853470437

There is one big thing that goes unresolved which leaves me very confused. Not informing the viewer of the contents of a certain container is head scratching at best. Maybe I missed something here and was supposed to understand what was in there?

2100862,5,B0002KQOH6,"The Return is a film that keeps its viewers waiting for something to happen. Yet in its case that is a good thing. In the situation of this story the-return comes with a dramatic exit. This is hardly a story about life happy ever after.

In The Return is a Russian family, two young boys, whose fathers absence has been his presence for more than a decade. Suddenly, without prior knowledge of his imminent appearance, the family absorbs the fathers presence. So alien to him, the father, are his sons that they have to look at an old family photo to confirm whether the man who suddenly shows up is their father or not. And then within days, of less, of his return it is decided the two boys with the father go on a automobile camping trip. It is on this camping trip the boys realize themselves. Conveyance of such information is realized through visual images rather than through expository dialogue.

Always present in the film is the tension between son and father.
Dialogue in this film is sparse and to the point. Long in duration are many cinematic shots of a car motoring along a road and of the youngest sons face, whose expressions tell about his resentment toward his father, always present as simmering drama rumbling beneath the storys surface. And than at times his pique surfaces as he acts out, acted out in the dysfunctional sense of the word, in opposition toward his fathers wishes. Yet the fathers will always prevails.

Performance of his resentment toward his father is made known by his facial expression and nuances thereof,  giving the surface appearance of his being one ornery kid, a role played masterfully by actor Ivan Dobronravov.

Tension between father and son mounts with each occurrence of his acting-out, voicing his opposition to his father. This tension keeps the story taut. Anticipation of something horrible is about to happen permeates each scene.

2100931,5,B0002KQOH6,"What life is all about, HIGHLY recommended.  This is a haunting movie I won't soon forget- so riveting (with very little dialogue, actually) I hardly noticed the subtitles.  The action speaks for itself.  Highly suspenseful, and you haven't the faintest idea what's going to happen, YET also full of simple, quiet moments that bespeak volumes (AND mysteries) about the characters.

The film is lyrical, poetic, almost subliminal, rather than ""expository"" (i.e., the payoff being in what happens along the way, rather than the ultimate ending).  Actually, lyricism and exposition are so expertly intertwined the film succeeds on BOTH levels.  But be forewarned, it has disturbing events, it's no walk in the park- if you're a sensitive person that can't bear tragic or traumatic themes, this may not be your cup of tea.  But the ending is absolutely seminal to the experience (of both the characters and the VIEWER).

This is the kind of movie rife with multiple possible meanings and interpretations, which invites repeat viewing.  Most importantly- you learn something about YOURSELF in your reactions to what unfolds- what you pay attention to, expect, hope for... fear.

***BIG SPOILERS FOLLOW*** DON'T read further until you've seen the film if, like me you're the kind of person who thrives on discovery and surprise.  Reading others' interpretations in advance will color your own, of course.

I read reviews on IMDB after viewing, and many people decried the ending- some found it very disturbing, others thought it, at the very least, unsatisfying.  No, the film does not have a ""satisfying"" ending [seemingly, anyway, though perhaps there's a kind of symmetry to it], that was the POINT (art imitating life), I thought. The boys learn a terrible lesson. Wherever Dad had been, whether he was a nice guy or not, whether he intended to stick around, whether he planned to make up for lost time, whether they'd resolve issues and forge a relationship- as troubling as those dangling threads [symbolized by the mysterious contents of the box] may have been- they were infinitely better than what actually occurred. (Or WERE they??)  Bring down the curtain on EVERYTHING where Dad is concerned. What a shock. Whether they had dreamed of reunion, hated his guts, been crushed by his desertion, yearned for him, whatever, there would now NEVER be a ""satisfying ending"", no-one would ever find out what the box contained.

BUT, there was ALSO the theme of the younger boy's fear of life, of many things. He cried and told his mother at the beginning if she hadn't come he would've died. He threatens to kill himself by jumping off the tower- then, he sees death up close, for real, he's even partly responsible. Crash course in what death REALLY means. What an enigmatic film- note the pics/selfies of the brothers on the trip home (interspersed with the credits- STAY TUNED)- in some they're laughing, now seem lighter (dealt with something unspeakable, faced it with courage, were transformed by the experience?  Both brothers change over the course of the film). Perhaps they're now FREE of the spectre of their father's desertion, and all the issues related thereto that have been hanging over their heads for 12 years (achieving a kind of closure). So perhaps the question is, did death represent being cheated of answers and what might have been, OR did it precipitate closure (albeit in a traumatic, kick-in-the-gut fashion)?  Could BOTH be true?  (Regret over what might have been and the need for closure are both integral parts of the grieving process.)  One might even wonder if, all things considered, if Dad or ""fate"" or God didn't give the boys a gift- the ultimate sacrifice, so that they might begin life anew.

In a nutshell, I think The Return is disconcerting because you think at its core it's about a relationship but it's actually about death and its ramifications.  In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Never-Sang-For-My-Father-1970/dp/B009PAUN62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Never Sang For My Father (1970)</a>&nbsp;Gene Hackman said ""Death ends a life, but it doesn't end a relationship.""  Or does it?

Thematically and mood-wise this film reminded me a lot of a favorite film, Hayao Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>- at the beginning Chihiro, too, is negative, whiny and pretty much afraid of everything.  While she doesn't face anything quite this bad, her parents will live or die as a result of her actions,  By the end of the film she's transformed- one of my favorite film themes (life themes too, for that matter).

And finally, the two brothers solidified their relationship on the trip, bonding as never before. Each became protective of the other when the father was unreasonable or harsh, later, at different points each threatened to kill him if he hurt the other. At the end the older boy assumed responsibility, never chiding his brother for what he had done, assuming the role of protective big brother or perhaps even ""father"". Contrast this with the way he treated his little brother at the beginning of the film.

However one interprets the film, it appeared that both boys were honed, improved by the sequence of events, and became closer (in this regard, and in every other way, it also reminds me a lot of Robert Redford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordinary-People/dp/B0012B1C3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordinary People</a>, which involves a death in the family and two people bonding at the expense of a third).  LOTS to chew on in The Return!  Highly affecting, and though harrowing at times, I thought it was wonderful, brilliant- a work of art.",1415232000,2,5815,5.345394736842105
2100932,5,B0002KQOH6,"In Russian, with English subtitles.  What a movie.  Absent father returns home to his wife and 2 sons after many years being gone.
Don't want to give away too much, let's just say that he's not very good at being a Dad.  Great acting by all, but the youngest son steals the show in my eyes.  I think he will grow up to be an exceptional actor, as he already is at such a young age.  Let's just say they go exploring with Dad, and little by little things begin to unravel.  It deserves the great reviews it got and it will have you rooting and cheering for the kids too.  Yet, you can't help but eventually realize that the Dad must have had a rough upbringing too, to be like he is.  That's the most I can say without giving away too much. Very worthwhile movie.

I didn't understand the point of this movie the day I watched it, but I think I get it now. At least my interpretation is that sometimes tragedy happens and that causes yet another tragedy: we're deprived of knowing things that would cause our situation to make sense to us.

We never found out what was in the box. We never understood the father's rationale. I think that was the point of the movie. Perhaps we were on the edge of finding out what was going on, only to lose it all. The second tragedy is being deprived of that knowledge. What was in the box, and what was in the father's heart, is secondary.

I gave the movie three stars because, while it was interesting, I was never on the edge of my seat. I was never really nervous about what was happening. It was just life. And that's why I didn't give it one star; the brilliance of the movie is in its authenticity. Situations like this happen, and this movie presented one of those situations at the risk of not conforming to movie norms. So I applaud the movie for being different.

In the end, I'm glad I watched the movie, but it wasn't awesome.",1404518400,,1144,4.331775700934579

The two boy actors are incredible. There are many stories in stories and it all works in to an allegorical tale of human life, loss, grieving and regret. The film leaves you to decide each persons motives for their actions by revealing many of the circumstances and details but never really coming out with a direct cause and effect. The dialogue is sparse and no one is willing to really deal with any issues below the surface, except Ivan. So much is left unknown, this would be an excellent film for a discussion group.

You would think that the fact that it is entirely in Russian would be a distraction, but actually it wasn't -- the captions were spot on. But, the movie itself was a huge disappointment. There are disturbing things about this film, such as the father's long unexplained absence, followed by his somewhat sullen and then hostile attitude toward his sons whom he hasn't seen in many years. Then there's the box that the father digs up and hides in the boat, and you never find out what's in the box.

I don't consider myself a shallow moviegoer by any means but neither can I justify some of the great reviews on here. IMO, this is one you should skip.",1385510400,,436,4.2023809523809526

The movie really is slow, and this makes it difficult for the average American audience to endure.  But the slowness of the plot was appropriate.  I also really enjoyed the Russian idioms.

This movie will stay with me for a long time.  It also heavily influences my views on the father-son relationship.  Everything subtle in this film, which probably makes the characters stand out even more.",1385251200,,638,4.642857142857143

2101028,5,B0002KQOH6,I love coming across foreign films that sweep you away in the story. I felt like I was able to watch this whole movie through while reading the subtitles and not lose a bit of interest. Not your average Hollywood blockbuster. It actually has meaning that is expressed very well by the actors. The movie lets your mind imagine the history of the characters and their relationships and really makes you think about the father's hidden mission. Wish there were more movies similar to this one!,1384300800,,490,4.709302325581396
2101029,5,B0002KQOH6,"Two teenage boys raised by their mother and grandmother in the absence of their father. They just try to replace that father figure with their connection to the group of teenage boys who challenge one another with dares and who play football, and eventually settle their disagreements with some good old fist fights. The younger brother; Ivan, tries to be up to his elder brother, Andrei, but he cant and needs his mother to settle his identity search. The mother and her love-solace. Mummy Andrei has torn my shirt!

Nothing abnormal there for a younger son. Cain and Abem are not far from this situation, the rivalry between two brothers, a dramatic rivalry whose victim is the younger one. But the film breaks that background into a far more tragic outcome.

The father comes back after twelve years of absence. And he decides to take them on a fishing trip in the back country. But they do not know how to react to a father. They check his identity with old pictures and they have to accept their mothers word too.

But it goes both all wrong and all right. All right because the elder son sticks to his father and tries to share this attachment with his younger brother, the two remaining close and sort of non-antagonistic though quite differently-minded allies. All wrong because the father plants a wedge between the two brothers and the younger one develops a systematic and very vocal hostility. The father will not be able to conquer him and in fact this younger brother will lead the elder one into not respecting a rule decided by the father and that will mean some harsh punishment for the elder one and the final peripetian culmination.

The trip that should have lasted one or two days turns into one week. And the situation gets worse and worse to the point when the younger one dares his father with a knife and runs away to the top of a lighthouse and the father will come tumbling down from the top to the sand below.

And the return of the father to his sons will become the return of the sons with the fathers body to the mother, at first, and then without the fathers body, in the crucial moment when they should have loaded him in the homebound car. That ending is an epiphany though because the younger brother will learn then to call after his papa or his dad, a word he had refused to use very stubbornly till that last moment. The father had in a way succeeded but he will remain a trauma in the memory of the two boys, for ever and ever.

A beautiful story about fatherhood and teenage especially because it is tragic, dramatic, traumatic. I guess fathers can often be that, carry in them this authority figure that is more frightening than radiating solace and love. And yet this authority is love, fatherly love and a child needs in their immediate environment these two sorts of love that have been systematically  and wrongly  associated to mother and father. These two loves are love-solace and love-authority. Things become wrong when one of the two or even both is or are missing. Children then look for substitutes and that can lead to dramatic situations, including the refusal of this love or these loves when they are encountered.

Then the return is a return to reality with a trauma in your mind.

2101030,5,B0002KQOH6,"Very deep movie. On the surface it is about the special role only a father can provide. On another level, the father has many similarities to God. The picture of the father in the book where Abraham is going to sacrifice Isaac, is meant to depict the assumption that we do what God asks of us, no matter how abhorrent (since by definition God cannot ask us to do anything evil, so we must have faith that even a sacrifice of one's own child is for the good). The kids do not understand what the father asks of them, and really cannot function without him, as the incident with the boat at the end proves.

The father , after asking the sons to ""cast the first stone"" at the kid that stole the money, gives the thief some money for food, showing a depth of goodness the kids cannot comprehend. Almost every scene has the camera linger after the actors leave the scene, representing the temporary nature of anyone's presence. In fact, at the end, there are no pictures of the father on the trip. There was really no ""evidence"" the father ever returned, just the memories. The implication of course, is objective evidence is not really that important when it comes to some things, like faith.",1383436800,4,1189,4.47926267281106

""Yes"" comes from the feeling of belonging to the family, more so than appreciation of care and protection on the father's side. The big question here is: do we feel true love in a situation when it comes to us as an abuse? Father hits his obedient sun for nothing but dies trying to save life of the disobedient one. Both love and need each other and still talk in terms of control and demand. Looks weird to an outsider, but it is really the Russian way. ""He does not love me if he does not beat me up"". Sounds sadistic, but it is not. Just a drama of miscommunication. Trust me.

It was so obvious what was going to happen in the last chase scene.

2101045,2,B0002KQOH6,"I wouldn't watch it.

I kept thinking it would have some sort of point but it never seemed to happen.  All of the characters in the movie were not likable.  I really tried hard to care for someone, root for them, or feel sad for them.. anyone.  But rotten characters and a script that never made me question anything or do any sort of soul searching.  And absolutely no entertainment value.

A couple of young Russian brothers are being raised in a family absent the father.  The result is the older boy looks for acceptance by any alpha male around and the younger is such a brat I found myself hoping he was the one that something horrible might happen to in this movie.

The father comes back unannounced, takes them on a mystery road trip never explained, and some tragedy happens that you can see coming a million miles away.  And then the beginning of a change starts to happen in one character that we are never allowed to witness and the mystery part of the story is never really explained.

I'm sure there was some sort of great symbolism or allusions too advanced for my simple mind (some of the cinematography was great), but I guess I'm giving the average joe type of review here.

I found myself wondering if the translation from Russian was accurate... I'm not sure how it has so many positive reviews.  I've seen worse otherwise I would have given it a one star.  Mystery budget?  It was too much no matter what.",1379116800,3,1427,4.45945945945946
2101046,2,B0002KQOH6,"The ending is terrible, the acting is good though. Throughout the movie you wonder why the father all of the sudden shows up, what is he involved in? The father seems to be involved with some shady business enterprise.  Is the father ever going to try to get along with his boys? It seems like near the end he might attempt to make amends with one of the boys but the father has an accident.

Then there is a box that the father digs up on an island they camp on. The father knows exactly where to find this box, the boys never find out about the box because it sinks with the boat in the lake. At least we could have found out what was in the box.

I could deal with not knowing some details about the father's life, but can't we have a little dialogue between the father and the boys with the father telling them a little about his life?  Plus maybe the father telling him why he was gone for so many years?  I guess the director wanted us to be like the boys who never find out to why the father came back.  Also for us to be like the boys who never learn much about their father but only know him as a mean, grumpy, and crouchy man with little patience.

2101087,3,B0002KQOH6,"The jacket of the DVD brags that the movie works on many levels. It does not. It works on the visual level almost exclusively. Only a truly rare eye can show us the world in a way that is simultaneously stilted and expansive. It is unforgettable. And the film is not without emotional impact. Apart from this, it is frustrating and unsatisfying.

When will these writers and directors learn that it's unfair to an audience to pose question after question that the plot never resolves. Here, the CENTRAL questions are never answered: Why has this father returned for the boys? What explains his erratic behavior? Why must he take them to the island? What has he dug up that was buried there? What about the mysterious phone calls? Is he really, after all, their father? The characters themselves ask some of these questions, and no one, especially the viewer, gets any answers.

2101091,3,B0002KQOH6,"This film is quite good.  It is really refreshing to see boys acting like boys and neither precious wunderkinds or babyish.  This feels like an epic story of coming of age, or one generation finally giving up, and feeling that its job now is to import its knowledge to the next and nothing more..at which point it becomes irrelevant.  The film moves so slowly as it draws us from civilization and mothering to the male world of hunting fighting and survival.  Manufactured things are old and near broken.  They always need men to keep them going, and they are used sparingly.  As thin as this movie is, I think the flaw is that it still tries to do a little to much.  The sub lot, or reason for the box?  I don't know, but I feel that it is a mystery that shouldn't be.

Even the brief glimpses we get of Mom and Grandma are unforgettable, especially Mom's eyes as she stares off into the dark as her momentarily returned husband gets into bed with her.  The scenery is bleak, barren, and stunningly gorgeous and there are no electronics anywhere in the whole movie.  What he does to the boys is terrible and real and what happens equally so.

2101112,5,B0002KQOH6,"Reviewer Roland Zwick really said it all about this amazing, stirring story.  I just want to second his review.  This is a mesmerizing study of the heartache that fathers and sons experience from enforced separation and how hard it can be to reunite.

People who find this boring have no real appreciation for deep and quiet probing of the human soul, and for the gradual but all the more excruciating buildup of tension that great art like this portrays. The film made me think of Hemingway, particularly his Nick Adams stories, about how boys grow into men in the wilderness,and how manhood itself can become a kind of emotional wildneress of its own.

For those who are perplexed about what's going on with the father, here's what the story line hints at pretty clearly:  the father was a convicted criminal, probably a smuggler and black marketeer, and has recently been  released from prison. He takes he boys to an island in the Gulf of Finland to recover a treasure he buried there before he was caught. It may be gold, or cash or jewelry or drugs, but it's valuable.  But the story is presented from his young teenaged sons' point of view, and we only see what they see.  The details about the father, though, aren't germane to the plot, which is all about how all three of the main characters struggle with trying to create a father-son relationship.",1366156800,,1359,4.656903765690377

The innocent, timid child's descent into hatred, resistance and petty viciousness and the father's poorly communicated, sometimes violent attempts to redeem himself are painfully portrayed in this movie. The movie is slow-paced and the conflicts arise from a clash of personalities rather than from life-threatening situations (ergo, if you were hoping for some pointlessly entertaining, fast-paced, guns-blazing superhero movie made for adolescents, this probably isn't the right type of film for you).

2101128,4,B0002KQOH6,"The other viewers that compare this to Tarkovsky and such are spot on.  This movie is an aesthetic experience, with a sparse plot, driven almost entirely by the actors' performances and the cinematography, both of which are sublime.  A minor chore to watch, but if you are willing to commit to it, and are a rainy day person with even a slight capacity for empathy, meaning even a modicum of soul, at all able to accept and then appreciate that there are people with inner lives and motivations vastly divergent from your own about in this world, then this film might end up pleasing you.  It did me, almost despite myself.

The story is of boyhood and fatherhood, damaged Russian masculinity, beginning and ending with towers looming priapic over the impassive steely feminine water of great northern Russian lakes, that the characters in the story throw themselves against, seeking to prove themselves to one another; climbing, jumping and falling from them seeking metaphoric redemption and ecstatic release..

The dead antihero arrayed like a viking warrior on his charonic skiff subsiding inevitably into the womb of the water, like Ajax fixed to the spire, death obsessed Achilles staring out over the wine dark sea; the hero finally undone, his treasure sunk into the depths of the lake hidden undiscovered in a ruptured boat. You probably need to read Lacan against Jung in Russian translation to truly get it, I almost certainly never will..

2101139,4,B0002KQOH6,"Moody and atmospheric film from Russia. A man returns to his wife and two sons after a 12-year absence. He takes his sons ostensibly on a fishing trip, but it soon becomes obvious that the father has a hidden agenda. The film is shrouded in mystery, and the mystery itself adds to the film's ever increasing tension. The viewer is more or less seeing the film through the eyes of the sons (although we are privy to some of the father's actions that the sons never see) We never find out where the father has been for 12 years (although we can certainly guess), because the sons never find out; we never know what is in the mysterious box the father retrieves from the island because, even though it is what is motivating him, the sons are never even aware of the existence of this box. We learn from a photograph that the elder son is probably old enough to remember his father before he disappeared, so perhaps that is why he is more willing to just accept the father's return, obviously more anxious to earn his father's praise and approval. The younger was just a baby, and so remembers nothing of his father. He is less accepting of the return and, in fact, seems to deliberately try to provoke the father. The father alternates between harsh, almost military-like discipline and genuine concern. These character traits combine with the moody atmosphere to arrive at an unexpected (if you do not read the reviews that summarize the entire plot) climax and a somewhat ambiguous (or at least unresolved) conclusion.

That's what this beautiful Russian film takes as its premise as it assaults the viewer with an overbearing father whose approach to parenting will outrage modern kinder/gentler parenting theory proponents. Although the point of view (from the perspective of the younger boy) encourages us to understand the film in psychological terms, those familiar with Russian Orthodoxy (a version of Catholicism) will recognize that the argument being made here is theological. The parallel between the film's assault on the viewer and the father's assault on his sons suggests a pious attempt on the part of the filmmaker to awaken modern, secular man to what the film argues is truly important.",1314230400,,808,4.992592592592593

But... what in the world was it actually about? I know, I've read the reviews that praise ""The Return"" for its refusal to fall in line with Hollywood convention, and wrap everything up in a neat package in time for the closing credits. But haven't we gone just a little too far here? Sorry, but there are way too many unanswered questions, too many elements left unresolved. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone yet to see the movie, so I can't even list them in this review without doing so.

I will give the movie this: I can't recall ever seeing a movie that so completely took me off guard as to how it progressed. In a million years, I would never have anticipated its climax, or guessed the ending.

2101149,5,B0002KQOH6,"This Russian film is a departure from the norm thriller/psychological drama, in that it offers so little information, you draw your own conclusions... seriously; you, the viewer write the storyline.  The film offers little dialogue and clearly, no explanations. Like any other film, you keep waiting for something that throws a clue your way.  Waiting and waiting...nothing.  The suspense continues.

Two brothers have grown up with a mother and grandmother, and without a father, who one day returns after a 12 year disappearance, nothing said, nothing to give us a clue of his whereabouts.  One morning, the kids find him in bed; he comes to the breakfast table without even as much as a hello to the boys.  It's mysterious.  That scene is predictory of his character throughout the film.

Next thing we know, he is taking them on a fishing trip to the wilderness, specifically to an island.  The father is rough, mentally and physically; and why this journey we don't know.  One thing, he demands that the boys call him father, but the younger one, Ivan refuses.  Ivan has more hostility and resentment against the man, while the other boy, 15 year old Andre, obliges and tries to bond.

Compliant, 15-year old wants to believe in a father, but the younger Ivan is skeptical, fearful, and said he could love him, if he saw a good side of the man.  He hated the father.  The acting is brilliant; we see the cold, untouchable father, unwilling to bend.  Child actor Ivan was amazing for his age.  So much emotion exudes from his little face and so much for a young boy to endure.

I doubt that I have seen a movie like this, tormenting, mysterious, and thrilling that provides such little detail.  The best one can do is pick up some clues from his behavior.  You need to think, analyze, speculate, and it becomes a story of your mind.  .... Rizzo",1275091200,2,1848,4.680124223602484

2101152,5,B0002KQOH6,"I was wondering how I could start this review, and it dawned on me that the best way to convey the meaning this film has for me is to simply state, matter-of-factly, just what it is about this moving that touches me.  Fatherhood.  Yes, being a father myself, I am always drawn to films that express the varying degrees of fatherhood; from the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly.  2003 was one of those years that stands out for me in the way the fatherly role was exposed and elaborated on.  Some of my favorite films from that year took the time to explore facets of this `character'.  `In America', `Master and Commander' (obviously from a symbolic way), `Finding Nemo', `Pieces of April', `Big Fish'; all of them reach that part of me very deeply.

Of them all, this is by far my favorite.

""Who's sleeping?""

This Russian film details a week long trip taken by two young boys and their long lost father.  After a twelve year absence, he returns without warning and decides to take his sons fishing.  The trip, littered with ambiguities, fights, questions and tragedy, will forever change young Andrei and Ivan (often referred to as Vanya).  Young Ivan is the most affected, both before and after the trip, as he struggles with his own perception of this man he (begrudgingly) calls `father'.

""There's all kinds of grown-ups.""

What I found so beautifully moving about this film is that it never once tried to force our emotions.  We are presented with a scenario, and the people involved push us in all different directions, but in the end it is left up to us to decide just how we feel about the individuals involved.  By shying away from an easy answer (there has been a lot of talk about the ending being too ambiguous, but for me the ambiguity is what makes this film so poignant) a broader range of emotional entitlement is allowed.  We can see the shades of pain that come from loss, no matter how much we know or don't know about a person.  Ivan is so clueless as to who his father truly is, but his anger, frustration, resentment and malice is all wrapped up in an undeniable love and affection.  He wants so badly to understand, but he fervently refuses to try.

""With our little hands.""

Presenting to the audience an honest and emotionally gripping exploration of that bond between father and son, `Vozvrashchenie' nails everything needed to cement itself in the mind of the audience.  The flawless performances of the three leads are only illuminated by the beautiful camera work (the gritty realism brought to the stunning cinematography is hauntingly effective) and the poignant and provocative script.  Each emotion is felt long after the scene has ended.

""Go get the ax.""

Oh, and just a little piece of advice; don't worry so much about what is IN the box, focus on what the box represents.",1267142400,4,2817,4.644444444444445
2101153,5,B0002KQOH6,"Everyone has already told you what the story is about, so i won't ramble about that. My curiousity was piqued when the father digs up this old ammo box. Other people have come up with ideas that he was a hit man, a burglar, a Russian gangster.
I imagined the man had been a prisoner of war (remember the wife said, ""he was a pilot"") and the box contained secrets, perhaps mementos and pictures of his family which he cherished and missed which could finally explain his absence and prove to his sons that he did really love them. Yes, he was tough, but other cultures deal with fatherhood and manhood differently than they do in the USA. The father took no nonsense, he was a discipinarian, he wanted to make men out of these boys. Call it tough love, it is necessary to survive in the real world, unlike the unrealistic and impractical American t.v. series, ""the Nelsons' or ""Father knows best"". My father was a lot tougher, this guy tried to bond with his sons. I don't think he was such a mysterious man, he was very human, he lost his life trying to save his sons life.
The end is open to interpretation, so i gave you my take on it.",1254009600,6,1137,4.317757009345795
2101154,5,B0002KQOH6,"After a 12-year absence, the father of two young boys unexpectedly returns home. The very next day, he takes them both on a fishing trip, which doesn't really turn out to be an actual fishing trip. These two boys are constantly ignored, insulted, and ordered around by their father in what seems to be a deadly test of will and manhood.

What makes this foreign film so special is that it's a truly original experience. There's no sappy Hollywood music, no melodramatic fluff, and (best of all) no ADD-induced cinematography. The direction of this film is ponderous and straightforward, which really heightens the suspense. The neverending mysteries surrounding the father makes the film: we never know why he acts the way it is, and that's why we don't fully trust the character. Why is he uncomfortable with fish? Why does he scorn his own sons? These questions become more natural as, near the end, we desperately want to know why he's become a (silent) drill sergeant rather than a real parent.

Director Zvyagintsev has given us a fine psychological thriller. The look and feel of ""The Return"" is something that we don't usually see in today's American thrillers. The actors, especially the kids, have done a splendid job. They actually turn out to look and act believable in their roles. Tragically, though, Vladimir Garin (who plays Andrey) died shortly before the premiere of this film. It's a big loss in Russian cinema because he could have accomplished many other things in the future. So rest in peace, Vladimir.

for any fan of serious film, this is a real thrill.  I can't come up with any more adjectives that haven't been exhausted by the hundreds of reviewers that have been raving about this film.
I can share one story that will illustrate its powerful effect.

At a screening for around 100 teenagers, I noted a real absence of any restlessness. When I turned around to observe the audience, they sat forward, riveted in unison to the screen. At the height of the drama, as one son climbs to the top of a tower, the DVD stuck. It froze.  The agonized scream of disappointment that came from this collective audience was the loudest I have ever heard, and will always stay with me.

2101156,5,B0002KQOH6,"I stumbled upon this 2003 Russian film and was pleasantly surprised by it.  Accolades and words are not enough to describe the film and it's quality. It is done so well, I just had to watch it twice, for the sheer pleasure of the cinematography and compelling story.

Stylish, solid and  beautifully filmed.  The music and sound effects are hunting and the acting is spellbinding especially from the 2 kids. It is a film by first time director Andrei Zvyagintsev, about a father and his two sons. I will not spoil it for you, but all what I will say is that movies are meant to be created this way.  Absorbing, riveting, thrilling and leaving you with so many questions to ask.  But soon as the film was over,  I watched it again, to find so many metaphors and references, it became a spiritual journey.  Observe in the beginning of the film,  the younger kid running up in the attic to look at the only picture of the returned father, and notice where it was placed in the book, look at the illustration.  Galina Petrova plays the silent grandmother and it only appears a few short seconds in the film, nevertheless powerful.  Andrei Tarkovsky has been mentioned for the style of the film and rightfully so.  I am sure the young director is very much inspired by the great master of cinema.  The Return is nothing short of a masterpiece.",1248739200,4,1338,4.525
2101157,3,B0002KQOH6,"I'm not sure how to rate this enigmatic movie: as far as cinematography is concerned it should be somewhere between 4 and 5 stars; as far as script is concerned perhaps 2 stars would be more appropriate. I have therefore gone for a Solomonic solution and given it 3 stars overall.
That does not mean that it is in any way a bad movie.  It's just that, for all the enthusiastic comments about the mystic marvels of this film, it somehow lacks body.  The fact that it is enigmatic does not in itself mean that it qualifies as a masterpiece.
It is very much in the tradition of oriental films, where pace is secondary to ""atmosphere."" If atmosphere were the sole criterion for judging the merits of this particular offering, then 5 stars would be more accurate. I have no objection to adding a good dose of mystery to a story, or indeed, having to scratch my head hard to try and work out what the thing was all about.  Movies that challenge the intellect are certainly up my street.
This movie, however, is not so much an intellectual challenge as an exercise in mystery without any real answers to the various questions it raises. There is no payoff, and nothing to be gained by speculating on the whys and wherefores of the characters and plot here. What we have is a beautifully filmed narrative of two boys who are taken by their unknown father on a somewhat testing outing which extends itself to a few days. It might best be described as an exercise in ""bonding,"" although very much in the Russian idiom, which is quite clearly different from what, say, Americans understand by the term. Whilst the two boys, excellently interpreted by the two young actors concerned, are clearly apprehensive as to the background and motives of their father, we,the audience, are left totally in the dark about him. I'm not sure whether this deserves praise or criticism, but it left me decidedly unsatisfied. It may be that the director left the whole thing in suspense so as to provoke the audience's powers of imagination, or simply that the father's story was so banal that leaving a question mark was preferable to telling us more.
In any event, to sum up, this beautifully made film which delivers the starkness of Russia in spades, was for me a promise unfulfilled.",1244937600,24,2260,4.630922693266833

What makes it so enigmatic that there is certainly symbolism there, of a Messaiah, an unknown father who has come from nowhere and who perishes trying to save his boy.

This symbolism is underscored by the very first scene where the father appears - he is sleeping, but in fact the whole composition, and even his image and facial features, are a direct depiction of Andrea Mantegna's ""Lamentation over the Dead Christ"" picture in Pinacoteca di Brera, in Milan.  It is amazing to think that Russian director obviously knew of this eternal picture.  And when we see the father the very first time as dead Christ, does it not foretell ominously his fate?

2101162,3,B0002KQOH6,"Before we can understnad the underlying themes in this film we have to provide our own answers to a few questions.

  1.  Why was the father gone for 12 years?
  2.  How did he know about the buried box on the island?  Had he buried it, or did he have a map?  What was in the box?
  3.  How did the boat, at film's end, instantly float, against wave action, 100 yards offshore.
  4.  How did the boat instantly sink, even though the boys had just rowed it across the vast lake?
  5.  Why, when Ivan looked at the family picture in the car, had the image of the father disappeared?

  I believe that this is a classic ghost story that goes something like this:
  The father robbed a bank, and his identity was discovered.  He fled to the isolated island that he already knew about, and buried the money underneath the house.  For 12 years he stayed there until he died of starvation.

  Even though he died, he could not continue into the afterlife. He found that he was held back by unresolved issues concerning his wife, his sons, and the money.  He returned to his home, where he was able to re-materialize because of his association with the living.  Do you remember what the reaction was, of his wife, on the one night he spent with her?  Something Isn't Quite Right.

  The ghost believes he still has affection for his sons, which is why he takes them on the fishing trip.  Although he shows intermittant affection, most of the time he seems burdened by their presence.  They camp at the first fishing spot after he buys the outboard motor that came in on the fishing boat.  Without that motor they cannot get to the isolated island.

  On the island he digs up the can full of money from the old house, and clandestinly hides it in the boat.  Because of his fall from the tower, the father is able to mimmic his death.  There is no loss of blood or broken bones, only the declaration by the elder son that he is dead.  On the long return trip to the car park, the father decides that he does not care about his wife or sons, only the money.  The boys, after a mammoth attempt to drag the boat on shore, manage to get the camping gear to the car.  Then they discover that the boat has floated a 100 yards off shore, and instantly sinks.  The father has gone to his grave with the only thing he cared about....the money.

  When Ivan looks at the family picture, the father image is no longer there because he has now passed into the afterlife.  The End.",1225152000,3,2459,4.285087719298246

That being said, I really don't see the magic in this film.  Other than the kid and the really cool scenery this movie has no point.

A pair of boys (a teenager and his younger brother) live with their mother in a decrepit town in northwestern Russia. Suddenly, their absent father returns (a rude and authoritarian figure, who it is suggested, has been a military pilot) and brings them to a mysterious island for what is presumably a fishing trip. But, as it turns out, in the island a treasure is buried, perhaps from a burglary from which the father might be connected. The older brother adores his father, while the younger one loathes him. The father becomes growingly brutal, and as the movie suspense increases, everything points out to a final tragedy. Fine performances by everybody, but specially the boys (sadly, after the movie was shot, the actor playing the older brother die in the lake shown in the movie, in a scene eerily reminiscent of one portrayed in the film).

2101168,3,B0002KQOH6,"""The Return"" aka ""Vozvrashcheniye"" (2003) tries to succeed on many levels - as visual allegory, suspense, road movie, and on the deeper, more dramatic level of the father - sons' connections. Two brothers, 15 year old Andrei and 12 year old Ivan who are very close, live with their mother and grandmother thinking that their father was dead. One day, the father returns after 12 year absence and on the next day, he takes the boys on the week long fishing trip. For all three of them, the trip changed their lives forever.

The Return is an impressive debut by Andrei Zvaygintsev. His camera man Mikhail Krichman and two young actors deserve the praise and the awards. But when I read that Zvyagintsev is Tarkovsky reincarnated and the film is as deep and meaningful as the best Bergman's works, I don't buy it. Why did the father insist on taking the sons with him while his reason to go to the mysterious island was far from fishing? Am I to believe that the best the father could do after 12 years absence was to humiliate and to treat his sons as a drill sergeant? The most important and emotional, central to the film scene on the island with the screams, tears, and hatred felt like so called ""Dostoyevshina"" - a la Dostoyevsky but without his pain, anger, and talent. Dostoyevsky would've gone deep inside his character's soul and heart to give us the reasons for his actions - in ""The Return"" I had to take the director's and writer's words for granted and it is hard for me to do. What did I learn? That the fathers see themselves in their sons, hate themselves and try to break their children so the children will not repeat their (fathers') mistakes? That ""The father always knows better?"" That the generation of the children and the parents will never (or too late) understand one another? Or another idea. Maybe the father represents the old, before ""Perestroika"" Russia. Why not? He was absent for 12 years - he disappeared somewhere in the beginning of 1990s - just when Soviet Union ceased to exist and his sons grew in a new country, and there is no place in their world for the dark past which their father embodiments. Anything is possible. One thing is for sure - it's been done before - poetic symbolism, magnificent indifference of nature, painful and honest dissections of the close relationships, and the return of the prodigal Odysseus.",1181088000,4,2361,4.648325358851674

Meanwhile, there's the creepy uncertainty that permeates the works of the masters of suspense. In its stark focus on three characters traveling alone together, it's also reminiscent of Polanski's early film, ""Knife in the Water.""

Visually the film is striking with its slow but persistent camera movement and the washed out color that reduces some scenes to monochrome. Meanwhile, the soundtrack music is spare and eerie. Most striking of all are the performances, as the taciturn and vaguely malevolent father interacts in unexpected ways with the two boys, who regard him with varying degrees of trust and distrust.

At some level, it's a film about fathers and sons and the distance between them as the immaturity, emotions, fears and physical weakness of boys are confronted by the uncompromising expectations of hardened adult males, who have shed any vestige of their own boyhoods as something to be scorned. And we keep watching the man for signs of his true character as he responds to the two boys, one of them willing to accept the man at his word, the other deeply suspicious and openly rebellious.

Based on a simple premise, it's a brilliantly conceived story that holds the viewer to the end, leaving us finally with unanswered questions that provoke reflection on the loss of innocence and the uneasy relationship between family and self. The DVD includes a one-hour making-of documentary that reveals many of the challenges of directing and shooting the film. Not least interesting is its commentary on working with the film's young actors.",1163116800,16,1846,5.085808580858086

2101171,4,B0002KQOH6,"While I very much admired it, let me say up-front that people with short attention spans will not enjoy the Russian film THE RETURN (a.k.a. VOZVRASHCHENIYE). It has a simple storyline, spare dialogue, and long takes. Watching it, one senses allegorical intentions of an almost Biblical proportion after a while.

Which is another way of saying that this is an art film. (Albeit a gorgeously filmed and affecting one.)

I was very sad to learn that the young man who plays the older brother Andrey (Vladimir Garin) died in a boating accident not long after THE RETURN was completed. This is odd and poignant; as Andrey, he spends a lot of time in a small rowboat. And he was a compelling actor whose face is a fascinating canvas of stubbornness, humor, and hope. (His brother, Ivan Dobronravov also gives a bravura performance.)

As to the film, with its mythic aspirations, it could easily have fallen flat. But it doesn't; instead, director Andrey Zvyagintsev's ambitions are realized through the believable acting, gorgeous cinematography, and intentionally  open-ended storyline. THE RETURN is not the kind of movie that you love, but you sure do think about it after the credits roll.",1149724800,7,1188,4.984848484848484

2101173,5,B0002KQOH6,"Some of the diaries of the German troops heading east to the attack on Russia seem to elicit not so much a fear of the Russian Army as being thunderstruck by the vastness of Russia.

The immensity of the country comes across in this purely Russian movie about two boys reunited with their father after a hiatus of 12 years. Since the boys, Ivan and Andrei, are so young, they have no independant memory of him and are forced to run to a secret hiding place where they have ferreted away a photograph of him. Both nod affirmatively: 'It's him.'

One of our weaknesses as Americans, whether we travel to foreign countries or read foreign books or see foreign movies, is that we expect to see the USA in a foreign tongue. When we don't, we criticise the effort because in our minds, it doesn't measure up. 'It just ain't normal, Gladys!'

So one thing this film isn't is that it isn't American. We don't know what the father was up to. We don't know why he came back. Millions and millions of sons and daughters grew up in that sad, anonymous, fungible childhood that was eastern europe after Communism. And in some families men returned and in some, other men returned. There wasn't any ""Leave it to Beaver"" and there weren't any ""Waltons.""

Beautifully filmed we see the boys taken on a painful and lengthy journey and in a manner of speaking, the journey represents their passage from adolescence to something else, not adulthood but something just before that.

2101174,5,B0002KQOH6,"This is not a film of Realism, but one of symbolic significance that perhaps only an acute observer of Russian culture would understand (Russian or non)--not to say that you could not watch the film and think that it is about abandonment, societal coldness, or irrational revenge, which it is on the surface.  But if you go on here writing a bad review because perhaps you rented it for $3 on Netflix and it ruined your evening then I would suggest that you stick with The Stroll ( Progulka ) or something equally engaging that gives you a taste for modern Russia.  Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but  sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience.  Most people on this side of the world are much too spoiled and naive to be able to grasp the horrors of having your world and everything you believe in turned upside down again and again and again until you have nothing to hold but the earth itself.  No one blames you for that, and I really have no idea why you would buy this movie anyway, unless you simply love the beautiful cinematography.  Sometimes movies do fail to make a point, but this is not one of them in my view.

Basically, if you buy this film without watching it first then you are asking for trouble.  Trust no one and make up your own mind by renting it first.  Do not form presumptions because you like foreign movies or because you are a Tarkovsky fan.  I would say that Tarkovsky is an influence on Zvyagintsev, but Zvyagintsev has his own ideas of what a film should do.  Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises.  This is not a digital camera, you know.  You have the unique opportunity to try it first before you buy.

Amazon reviews are at you disposal.  Make your decision.  Rent it and then buy it...or do not.

The father doesn't transmit his feelings, sunk in his own world and trying to get some affection, he invites his sons to fish.

This journey will be the big frame in which the complex dramatis personae will unfold. A crude and incisive glimpse around one of the most sorrowful and common portraits in any latitude of this world.

""The Return"" to me seems only like an introduction that Tarkovsky could have used to develop a piece of art.  It lacks depth that could have been reached, but it seems as if it was intentionally left unexplored with intention to be deliberately associated with great master himself.

The movie is merely a drama exploring topics of daily life where most of us are victims of unfavorable life situations and where nobody teaches us how to find strength.  So we all look into movies like this with expectations to find wisdom and feel or understand better ourselves and the world.  But that is where this movie does not deliver.  It sets up its characters in the right way and then it wanders aimlessly as if it is trying to uncover a hidden treasure but it can never make a decision.  And it is not `why' that the movie needs to answer here.  A lot of art is created that leaves things unanswered and mysterious, but still delivers not just a beautiful landscapes and great music for the senses to enjoy, but also the patterns to be uncovered in one's mind.  What this move needs is the message that one can take home and reflect and learn something from.  A message that can transcend across the boundaries of our knowable world.  Something that tell us more who and what we are, and not just expose the pain that exists in the world (which one see whenever one watches TV news).  So that one can see ""yes here is the pain, how do I live with it and break it apart and overcome it?.""  There is no such wisdom you will find in this movie. And don't misunderstand me, I am not a proponent of self-help books, Anthony Robin, religious escapes etc.  I am talking about our human situation that Tarkovsy, for example, was able to masterfully represent and build upon it.  The height that he reached may be unsurpassable as the complexity of fugues of Bach today are which brings me to explanation why this move has caused such a hype.

I can only explain the hype as a result of pain that Tarkovsky lovers feel for having lost him prematurely forever, so that anything that appears that is even remotely similar creates a hope that a replacement is possible.

Now, I am not saying that a replacement is not possible and that Zvyagintsev will or will not be another Tarkovsky.  He may very well develop his style on his own and get out of Tarkovsky's shadow.  However, this movie is weak and is only emotionally charged as one wants to see it is, and I am betting that you'll forget it very soon.  Because the mysterious or mythical notions do not linger for long in a reason driven human mind unless they are resting on the foundation of fear of dying. Otherwise, you'll believe in aliens, government conspiracy, God and other forms of escape, you'll click that this review was not helpful :-) and most likely love this movie.",1133481600,13,3043,4.5063752276867035

lacking message. I thought it was a very

simple, but highly imaginative plot.

At times the film moves slowly but it's a

sleeper which climaxes brilliantly and leaves

you stunned.

As for the ""message"", the ""message"" may

be lost on Americans because the film's

characters and their problems are quite

Russian.

The father is a macho, laconic, at times

physically abusive, a drinker--not your

sensitive American type father. He's

quite Russian, actually.

The boys are fatherless for 12 years until

he returns. Why was he gone and why so

casually does he return?

Possibly, he's a Russian mafia type wanted

by authorities or by the mob for a botched

deal or murder.

But the tension of the film seems to lie

in the boys' young minds: why did father

leave us? Does he love us ? Would he hurt

us ? Who is he really ? A criminal ?

This tension is what I mean by ""Hitchcock

suspense"".

And the very macho, laconic Russian male

figure adds to the suspense. The father

and the sons do at the end what suppressed

emotional figures tend to do in real life--

they explode with passion.

The theme of fatherless children is very

Russian when you consider that Russia

lost 25 million to the Nazi invasion. At

least two other Russian films I can think

of deal with similar issues.

If the film has any ""message"", it would

be that ""Still Waters Run Deep"". Men

are not so much lacking in emotion as

they are overwhelmed by its intensity

and unable to express it.

The boy's father is such a figure. He

seems devoid of emotion, a very macho,

seemingly uncaring.

But at the end, you find out how much

he really may have cared for his sons.

And one may suspect that it might have

been his very love for them that caused

him to go away--perhaps to spare them

the danger of being involved in his

shady dealings.

The father is redeemed at the end and

questions about his love for the boys

seem answered.

The tragedy of his character is that he

was unable to communicate well with the very

people he cared most about until it was

too late.",1130803200,21,2109,4.445623342175066

2101182,2,B0002KQOH6,"""The Return"" is a tediously slow epic whose lack of plot detail is apparently being received as profundity.  There are some excellent performances in the small cast.  Ivan Dobronravov in his first picture plays Ivan the younger son who rejects and is suspicious of his father.  The one scene on the beach where he tells his father that he wants to love him and then tears off in the opposite direction is enough to rip your heart out & hand it to you on a platter.  The older brother Andrei played by Vladimir Garin does an excellent job as well.  Perhaps in Russia people have more time to take or life seems more relaxed.  Director Andrei Zvyagintsev takes a very long time to communicate very little.  The father is absent for 12 years and returns with no apparent explanation by the mother other than, ""He's back.""  The boys think he was a pilot, but why didn't he ever come home?  The subsequent clandestine trip with the boys leads one to believe that the father was a criminal, but why take the boys on this trip?  Apparently, the brusque father who can abandon a son on a bridge to suffer a drenching rainstorm does also love the boy as he shouts ""Vanya"" as he tries to scramble to save the boy.  Natalya Vdovina as the mother seems alternately maternal and sleazy.  One wonders why she'd allow a husband gone for 12 years to suddenly take the boys out on a trip without her.  In the end, as the dysfunctional family collapses, I wondered why so little care is given to these young sons.  Perhaps like an epic beer commercial, why ask why.  The answers are not given and the questions are less than profound.  The DVD offers almost no extras.  So if you're a very patient viewer or one whose life is going so fast that you're looking for a way to slow down, this is the film that will do it for you.

I personally love movies where I am unable to predict anything. How refreshing and disturbing!

It is a movie made by a Russian director, with outstanding Russian actors (the kids!), but there's nothing ""Russian"" about the story.

From then on, ""unexpected"" is the guideline and you hold your breath. What is going to be revealed? What is going to happen? How will the three characters deal with their new relationship?

2101184,5,B0002KQOH6,"Communication brings people closer, as shared information removes obstacles such as guessing and assumptions.  For example, if a person says, ""I am scared.""  People know that the person is scared and it offers an opportunity for people to help the person overcome the fear in one way or another.  Thus, communication also becomes the foundation upon, which education and enlightenment rest.  If communication perished, enlightenment and knowledge would see their final days because the next generation would never receive the information from previous generations.  This displays why communication and why language is so essential for human existence.  The Return illustrates a returning father and his inability to communicate, which will leave the audience in a cerebral no man's land guessing and concocting their own assumptions.

The director Andrei Zvyagintsev opens the film by a pier where a large diving tower is located.  Some young teenagers are jumping from the tower while Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov), one of the younger kids, does not jump as her fears height.  His friends and his older brother Andrey (Vladimir Garin) leave him on top of the diving tower whimpering in fear while the cold sea breeze brushes his body.  This leads to a situation where some of Ivan's friends call him a coward, which he denies.  Ivan ends up in fight with his brother, and he runs home to tell his mother while she simply states, ""Don't wake your father.""

Flabbergasted the two boys look at their mother, when she says that their father (Konstantin Lavronenko) is at home.  These two boys have not seen their father for over a decade, and now he has returned for whatever reason.  The first thing the father has decided to do is to take the two boys on a fishing trip; however, the trip turns out to be something completely different than what the kids had in mind.

Throughout the trip, the father is abusive and rough with Ivan and Andrey.  However, besides this the audience has to follow a trail of suggestive ideas, which leaves the viewer with mere assumptions.  Several reviews have pinpointed this speculative atmosphere in the film that the father in the film generates through his persona, as he never provides a motive to his actions.  Some reviews have suggested that he is a crook out to recover some old loot while others have proposed that the father tries to teach his two sons to become men, as their upbringing has lacked a male role model.  It does not really matter what the audience thinks, as all ideas can be true.  What seems to matter is the father's inability to communicate with his two sons, as he often leaves them confused, hurt, and withdrawn.

Cleverly, Zvyagintsev uses the mise-en-scene in the film, which helps create the tentative milieu.  The many majestic shots expand the viewer's mind in several directions, as they provide the audience an opportunity to ponder the insignificance of the character's identity.  This enhances the ominous tension shaped between the children and the father, which might lead the audience's mind in a negative and darker direction of the father's intentions.  The camera filter also plays an important role in producing a negative atmosphere, as it boosts the emotional distance between the father and the boys.

The highly speculative atmosphere that Andrei Zvyagintsev generates through his film suggests the notion of poor communication and highlights the importance of good communication.  Communication is also an essential part of cinema, as cinema is visual storytelling that can use dialogue and other auditory signals to promote a story.  Regardless of the story's outcome, the audience learns a threefold lesson through the film about the importance of language and communication.  The most obvious lesson is in regards to the boys' confusion and pain in the story due to the father's poor communication.  The second lesson that Zvyagintsev teaches the audience is through the viewer's own assumptions and guesses based on the lack of information.  The final lesson of communication that the film provides is in regards to our short existence on earth, which suggests that one should seize the day when the chance presents itself.  Ultimately, the audience can reflect over the pictures at the end in the film, as these images provide several different ideas.  This is the beauty of art, as it leaves the audience with their own interpretations and thoughts, which maybe could lead to a revelation of some sort helping people with proper communication.",1113436800,6,4527,5.067476383265857

Ivan wimps out and gets in a fight with his brother who joins their friends in mocking his cowardice. Then they go home to a bombshell. Their father is there. He hasn't been seen for 12 years and has inexplicably returned. What is more he is going to take them on a trip in his car. It's not clear quite where but fishing will, it seems, be involved. Off they go but it soon becomes clear the father-son bonding isn't really working out, especially with Ivan who is increasingly hostile and rebellious, insisting to his brother that there is something sinister and dangerous about this man. At times indeed it seems he might be right: we know nothing about this man, not even his name, never mind the identity of the person he `phones from the caf or the contents of the strange box he digs up. At other times, it merely seems this is a fairly well-intentioned but awkward man with little understanding of how effectively to engage with young boys. In any case we observe rising tensions and a steadily growing sense of dread until the shocking climax where - well, I'm not such a dreadful spoilsport that I'm going to tell you.

This is youthful director Andrei Zvyganitzev's first movie. Cinematographer Mikhail Krichman, writers Vladimir Moiseyenko and Aleksandr Novototsky and composer Andrei Dergachyov are all also pretty new to the game. All five of them look like pretty good news for Russian cinema. Made for a tiny budget, this is a breathtakingly good movie: deep and beautiful and utterly unforgettable. Krichman's photography is phenomenal. The acting from the three leads, Konstantin Lavronenko as the taciturn and ambivalent father, and the two neophyte child actors Ivan Dobronravov as the petulant younger brother Ivan and Vladimir Garin as Andrei is consistently astonishing. (Heartbreakingly, Garin died in a swimming accident before the film was released.) It's full of scenes that could not be more perfectly realized. One that stands out for me is where Ivan, after a fight with his dad, is briefly abandoned alone on a bridge over a river. He sees a lorry approaching in the distances. It reaches him and drives past. That's all but,...wow. I grant you it certainly doesn't sound very exciting. But then neither does Omar Sharif appearing in the distance and slowly approaching Peter O'Toole across the sand sound very exciting to people who haven't seen `Lawrence of Arabia.'

2101187,5,B0002KQOH6,"...from the heart of (first-time!) director Andrey Zvyagintsev to the soul of the viewer, that is.  This film is nothing short of amazing.  The story is moving, believable and deep on both psychological and emotional levels -- the cinematography, writing and pacing are right on target -- and the acting is as close to perfect as either a director OR audience can imagine.

Konstantin Lavronenko plays the long-lost father with just the right mix of strength, mystery and cool understatement -- his character would give many actors an excuse to overplay and draw attention away from the young men portraying the sons, the true centers of the film.  The balance he achieves here is a tribute to the care with which he pursues his craft.

The two young actors who play brothers Andrey and Ivan (Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov, respectively) turn in some of the most believable, moving performances I've ever seen from people their age.  The depths of emotion and commitment they give to their roles is extraordinary -- it's a level of quality that is a joy to see in actors of ANY age, but to see it in these who are so young is incredible.

The fact that this is director Zvyagintsev's first feature film tells me that this is indeed a filmmaker to watch -- and I don't think a film of this quality can be written off as 'beginner's luck'.  His talent is formidable -- I look forward to seeing more from him.

The story unfolds at just the right pace -- the audience is given no clues as to what will happen next, and is kept is just as much suspense as the characters in the film.  The honors this film received at the Venice Film Festival were justified -- I can recommend it without reservation to anyone, whether they favor 'art house' cinema or simply a well-made film telling a compelling story.

Additionally -- it's nice to see Kino expanding the scope of their 'special features' on this DVD.  They've released a good number of quality films, but the 'extras' on the ones I've seen have been a little thin.  This one has a really nice documentary (63 min) included, a 'film about the film', a well-made and informative look behind the scenes.",1112313600,5,2155,4.624671916010499

The reason: their father who has been gone many years has suddenly come back and is sleeping inside. The kids are confused, delighted and suspicious all at the same time. The Father offers to take the kids for a 3 day fishing trip. Andrei, the elder son wants to gel with his father and follows him everywhere. Ivan, the younger son is a little held back and suspicious.

Father's behavior with his kids fluctuates between the caring to the harsh, but mostly harsh. On one occasion he abandons Ivan on the road and in freezing rain only to pick him up later. At times, he ensures that the kids are wearing jackets for the nippy evening. On the second day they paddle to a desolate island in near blizzard like conditions and camp in the open. Things just get bad on the island and a sudden tragic accident happens. The events thereafter have been directed brilliantly.

Astonishingly enough, this is the feature film debut for director Andrei Zvyagintsev who demonstrates more of a mastery and command of the medium in this his maiden effort than most directors do in a whole body of work.

The film tells the tale of two brothers, Ivan and Andrei, who live with their mother and grandmother in a small coastal village in Russia.  One day, totally unexpectedly, the boys' father returns after a twelve-year absence.  In an effort to make up for lost time, the dad decides to take his sons on a fishing trip, but, almost immediately, he begins to demonstrate disturbing tendencies towards domination and abuse.  He also appears to be up to some sort of nefarious business operations to which neither we nor the boys are entirely privy.

Every single moment of this film is a revelation.  Zvyagintsev beautifully captures the opposite ways in which the boys react to and interact with their father.  Andrei, the oldest, is so desperate for a father figure in his life that he is willing to overlook the often inexplicable, bizarre and possibly even dangerous behavior that this particular father exhibits.  Ivan, on the other hand, embittered by years of absence and neglect, seethes with barely disguised rage at the man who now presumes to enter into their once happy lives and assert his authority.  Of the two boys, he seems the most tuned into the kind of threat the father may pose to their welfare.  Yet, towards the end of the story, the apparently latent love the boy feels for this man as his father does eventually rise to the surface.  Through this intense interaction, the film emerges as a complex and profound study of what father and son relationships are really all about.

It is virtually impossible to put into words just how brilliantly the two young actors use their facial expressions to convey a wealth of meaning and emotion.  As portrayed by Vladimir Garin, Andrey looks up to his father with a mixture of boyish pride and trembling awe, longing for the kind of male affirmation he has been deprived of all these years.  He is desperate to please his father by proving to him that he can perform the acts of manhood that his dad keeps putting forth for him to do.  As Ivan, Ivan Dobronravov spends most of his time glaring at the man, his mouth pursed in a tight unyielding grimace of resentment and hate.  If I could give an award for the best performance by a child actor in movie history, these two youngsters would be high on my list of candidates.  They are that amazing.  Tragically, young Garin drowned two months prior to the release of the film, leaving his indelible mark behind in a performance that will never be forgotten by anyone privileged enough to witness it.  Konstantin Lavronenko is equally impressive as the boy's mysterious father, beautifully underplaying the part of a man who can appear sane and rational on the surface but who is a seething cauldron of untapped emotions beneath.  In fact, it is this constant threat of violence always on the verge of eruption that keeps us off balance and on edge throughout the entire picture.

The film's writers, Vladimir Moiseyenko and Aleksandr Novotosky, deserve special recognition for not allowing the plot to overwhelm the characters.  For this is, first and foremost, a great character study.  The scenarists have intentionally left the background of the father vague and sketchy, the better to enhance the sense of mystery and danger he represents.  We never find out what nefarious activities he is involved with since that is of virtually no importance either to the children or to us.  We are too engrossed in the relationships of the characters to care.  In fact, there are a few hints towards the end of the film that this seemingly cold, uncaring man, for all his myriad faults, might actually just love his sons in his own strange way.  The film leaves us with no easy answers or pat resolutions at the end.  And this is how it should be.  In fact, the scriptwriters even throw a few of Hitchcock's prized ""MacGuffins"" into the mix to keep us off balance (there is a scene in which some possibly stolen money sinks to the bottom of a lake that is highly reminiscent of what happens in ""Psycho"")..

Among other things, ""The Return"" represents one of the most impressive directorial debuts since Francois Truffaut`s ""The 400 Blows.""  Zvyagintsev's ability to draw great performances from his actors is only one of his many talents on display here.  His lyrical use of composition, as well as the way in which he makes nature and weather an integral part of his drama help to draw us so deeply into this world that it takes the viewer literally hours to get fully back to his own existence again once the movie has ended.  It reverberates for days afterwards.  For as with any great film, ""The Return"" finds its way into the depths of one's soul and leaves the viewer a richer person for the experience.

Winner of the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival (2003), ""The Return"" is a true work of art and one of the outstanding films of the decade so far.  Whatever you do, don't miss this film.",1108944000,101,5319,4.723726977248104
2101198,3,B0002KQOH6,"Rarely, I'll see a movie that's unsatisfying all the way through. THE RETURN is unusual in that it captured and held my interest, then left me unfulfilled at the very end.

THE RETURN opens with a group of Russian boys, including brothers Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravon), leaping into the water from a tall observation platform at the end of a stone jetty in a bleak, seaside town. (The town's name is never revealed, but, from the geography seen during the film, is presumably located somewhere on the Baltic.) The younger of the brothers, 12-year old Ivan, is afraid to make the jump, and is subsequently deserted by the others and left alone to get himself and his injured pride down. But Ivan's terror is so great that he eventually has to be rescued by his mother (Natalia Vdovina), whose faded beauty seems out of place in this desolate place. Rejoining his friends the next day, Ivan is jeered as a coward, and chased home by Andrei, where their mother cautions them not to wake their father (Konstatin Lavronenko), who's sleeping. The thing is, you see, Ol' Dad has been mysteriously absent these past twelve years. Ivan only remembers him through an old picture squirreled away in an attic trunk. During their first family meal after he awakens, the atmosphere is strained. Nobody asks, nor does the prodigal parent volunteer, where he's been. (Perhaps the mother knows, but she's not telling.) The father does commit, however, to taking his boys on a lengthy fishing trip beginning the next day.

Thus begins a tense journey of non-discovery for father and sons. From the beginning, Andrei seems content to have his Dad back and doesn't question the where and why of his disappearance. For his part, the father seems to be using the fishing expedition as a cover for some other agenda, especially as the trip takes them to an offshore island, where he goes off alone to dig up a box hidden under the floor of an abandoned hut. Towards his sons, he is, at best, remotely solicitous - concerned in some detached way that they grow into self-reliant, strong men; he certainly isn't a pal. At worst, he's physically abusive, and he never talks about his past or his love for his offspring (if, indeed, he has any). Ivan reacts to this emotional chasm with angry resentment and surliness. At one point, he declares to Andrei his readiness to stab his father if the latter touches him. Talk about an attitude problem! This familial dysfunction eventuality leads to tragedy.

THE RETURN is a dark story about a conflict of wills - the obstinate Ivan versus his uncommunicative father. It's wonderfully constructed around menacing, yet austerely beautiful, landscapes rendered more stark by a purposely washed-out, almost monochromatic, cinematography. If this is the sort of film that appeals to you, then enjoy. However ...

I wanted more. If I wish to observe a battle of wills, then I need only witness my wife trying to get the pet cats to eat a can of feline feast that they don't want. (And you know who wins that contest! Wretched, ungrateful creatures.) While the evolution of the film's plot implies that the father's time away was spent on that island, why was he ever there in the first place? What was in the mysterious box? Those questions were never answered, and I was left muttering with frustration. For that reason, I'm only giving it three stars rather than the five that more sophisticated viewers would perhaps bestow.",1107475200,8,3462,4.81344537815126
2101199,5,B0002KQOH6,"One of the beautiful aspects of Andrei Zvyaginstev's ""The Return"" is that it leaves open any interpretation. The film is emotional, intense, mysterious, minimalistic, and filmed with grayish hues to set a mood of impending questions from the beginning. Two young brothers come home to discover that their estranged father of twelve years is back. They are a bit perturbed and must confirm the reality of what's going on by looking at an old black and white photo taken many years ago to make sure there is a physical resemblance.
The father is a man of few words and intense sad eyes. He decides to take them on a trip to go fishing and camping. During this venture as the plot unravels we discover that this strange man is mean to both his sons. The older boy Andrey, wants his father's love and approval and overlooks the abuse, but the younger Ivan does not and is outspoken about it. The tension in the film keeps building since you have no clue what the father's intentions are and you often wonder why he even came back in the first place.
The young Ivan acts out towards his father and he is actually abandoned on a highway for many hours in heavy rain. Once the father felt Ivan had learned his lesson he goes, back to pick him up and they are stuck in the mud. While trying to drag the car out, the father bashes Andrey's face against the car giving him a bloody nose. After that incident, the quick-tempered Ivan questions if this man is even his father and contemplates stabbing him if he comes near him or tries to hurt him. He confides all this to his older brother, but Andrey being in denial just thinks Ivan is perhaps a bit paranoid.
They go to a shoreline, build a boat, and go off to a remote island. Events begin to get a little weird, the boys are always hungry, and father doesn't pay much attention to that matter and keeps disappearing. At one point, the father is found digging to what looks to be a grave, and digs out a little wooden box that we never find out what's in it. But why dig such a big hole the size of a grave?
Anyway, I don't want to give the film away anymore than I already have because it is a must see. YES IT HAS SUBTITLES, however this film is brilliantly directed, and it will make you wonder and ponder for hours. The ending is almost heartbreaking when those two frail boys have to drag their father's body into the boat to do the right thing, and when they finally get him into the boat (he was a large man), he looks like a much nicer person laying their dead in a coffin.",1106265600,5,2524,4.315789473684211
2101200,5,B0002KQOH6,"Andrei Zvyagintsev's 2003 debut, 'Vozvrashcheniye' ('The Return') throws into sharp contrast much of the dreck that has come out of Hollywood for 200 times the cost of Zvyagintsev's reported $500,000 budget.  This is an incredible film with layer upon layer of meaning and interpretation.  The writers, the cinematographer and director demonstrate nothing short of genius here.

It's tough to even begin to talk about the movie without revealing too much.  A father - gone for 12 years - returns.  Prison?  Mafia?  These are the prosaic reasons my wife and I came up with.  A 63-minute documentatary on the DVD gives you some insight into the shoot, the funding, how the project came together, etc.  But the essence of the film itself - the script, the story concept, its staging - remains inscrutable and opaque.  But after seeing the viewer commentary posted on IMDB, I realized that my understanding of the film had only scratched the surface...there are overtly religious overtones at play here (including one spot-on restaging of Andrea Mantegna's ""The Dead Christ""), some possible commentary about the last days of Communism vs. the 'new' Russia, and one further interpretation about the brothers and their diary that completely turned the movie on its head and - upon further review and thinking - I now see as a brilliant revelation.  Again: it's genius that Zvyagintsev and crew have layered all this in and have us all talking and interpreting and re-thinking.

I had come here with the intention of waxing poetic about the acting skills of 'younger son' Ivan, as played masterfully by Ivan Dobronravov.  But nothing I say is going to top the previous reviewer's comment that he makes Haley Joel Osmont (in 'The Sixth Sense') look like the red-headed kid from Different Strokes.  Now, that's a brilliant way to state it.  Touch, sir!

Tragically, this will be Vladimir Garin's (elder son Andrey) only film.  He drowned shortly after the filming completed and before the movie hit the big screen in art houses here in mid-2004.  He wasn't as strong an actor as young Dobronravov, but towards the end of the film, you can feel him gaining confidence.  The filmmakers even make note of the fact that by the end Garin was leading them.  A real tragedy.",1104019200,26,2258,4.938992042440319
2101201,4,B0002KQOH6,"'The Return' opens with the stark image of a few boys standing atop a tower overlooking the murkiest of bays. It is cold and the drop is quite a large one, presenting them with yet another danger to defeat. Two of these boys are brothers: the teenage Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and the younger Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov). One by one they begin to jump off the top and into the depths of the water, leaving young Vanya curled up in a ball, crying at the thought of descending from such a height. The rest of the boys later learn he never jumped after leaving him there, nearly scared for his life. They call him a pig, a coward, and even his brother joins in the criticism, till the two begin to beat each other up, chasing each other back to their house where their mother stands on an empty porch, smoking, looking into the distance: ""Don't wake your father.""

The boys' father (Konstantin Lavronenko) has been gone for 12 years. During that period of time, the brothers became close, bonding emotionally (as revealed in the first few scenes afore mentioned), and adjusted to life without a father they knew existed and thrived elsewhere. Now, they come to dinner to find him pouring wine for his wife and mother-in-law. He is commanding, stern, stoic: it seems as if he is incapable of expressing emotion, fascinating Andrei and Vanya nonetheless. Their hesitant mother sends the boys with their newly arrived father on what is believed to be a fishing trip, but is exhibited to be something more intriguing, an idea that unfortunately is never fully developed (any attempts to shape the father's other intentions on this trip are often confused and unfocused).

What remains strong throughout is the film's use of metaphor. The story turns into that of a road trip, the father teaching his boys life lessons along the way. He maintains his stern disposition even when he inflicts both physical and emotional hardship upon his sons, both of whom barely know him, in turn taking mere slaps and yells deep to heart, judging his every action. This situation progressively begins to reek of societal and political comparisons. Luckily, the film never reaches that level of didacticism which limits one's room for interpretation. In addition, the intense human emotions demonstrated in the central relationship remain palpable, despite 'The Return' being obviously allegorical.

Much of this emotion is well maintained as a result of strong acting. Lavronenko's father is always nuanced with near-tearful eyes or looks of worry and of pain revealing his deep longing for his sons' affections. Garin's Andrei is perfectly naive, balancing his character's symbolic and human natures. However, it is perhaps Ivan Dobronravov's Vanya that most affected me.

Recently, critics and movie-goers have acclaimed little Freddie Highmore's performance in 'Finding Neverland' as masterful. Though I loved Highmore's work, there is no doubt the also quite young Dobronravov does all Highmore did in 'Neverland' and then some. I was impressed with his ability to completely draw me into his character's feelings, never black-and-white, but honest. There is a scene where he's atop yet another tower --for reasons I will not mention, as not to ruin the film for you-- and he whispers hurtful words to himself, and I sat in my bed in complete emotional shock. Coming out of Dobronravov's mouth, these words were meaningful and dug deep within my heart, as I was able to witness the dimensions in them unfolding, one after the other. This occurs before a drastic, but completely necessary and well-handled twist in the story. As a result of Dobronravov's acting, the final third of the film carries an emotional weight on its back that serves both the film's metaphor and its human message well, elevating 'The Return' to a level you did not see approaching. I applaud this child's performance, and it will undoubtedly end up on my short list for the year's best lead acting performances. Not since Haley Joel Osment in 'The Sixth Sense' have I been this impressed, this moved by a child actor (sorry, Keisha Castle-Hughes).

I urge you to see this movie. Sure, at times it may be a bit slow-moving, but a performance by a child this dimensional, cinematography this gorgeous, a metaphor this well presented: it's all so rare, I cannot help but strongly admire director Andrei Zvyagintsev for giving us a film strong at its core, if not polished on its surface.",1103587200,5,4436,4.941018766756033
2101202,5,B0002KQOH6,"This film's power is revealed in the contrast between the events as they play out and the questions generated by the enigmatic final moments. It worked firstly as a mysterious, psychological drama, but once the film had ended, it fit the definition of the term allegory perfectly.

""The Return"" makes a compelling case in favor of a poetically complex narrative over the expectations of 'The Hollywood Ending', where life eventually makes some kind of sense. The absence of a father can create a psychological 'presence' for the family, both seen and felt in the emotional interaction of the children. This complex, yet all too human condition is played out here, not as a narrative sleight of hand (The Sixth Sense) but rather as film poetry. Life's hardest truths sit like a stone in the mouth and won't be broken down easily. The characters in this film seem to be struggling with the absence of their father or husband, but doing so with him present.

Visual cues which seem to lead to a metaphorical reading of what's happening are scattered throughout the film. For example, when the the boys see their sleeping father for the first time, he's viewed as Andrea Mantegna's ""Dead Christ"". The boys dash upstairs immediately afterwords to see if he looks like their father from an old photo, loosely placed in an old book of engravings - on the page where the angel stays Abraham's hand before he sacrifices his son. Then there is the repeated image of the tower, seeming to both foreshadow and justify a fear of death for the youngest brother. And the mysterious journey to an island, the significance of which changes them all. These don't appear as kitsch cues (as in, ""this image stands for this specific idea."") but appear as symbols whose meaning is more poetic than literal. They're tied to the story and can't be extracted cleanly. In true Tarkovskian form the filmmaker has bled his symbols of specific reference and made them about the characters.

And there's the profoundly enigmatic manner of the father, existing for the two brothers in terms of curt preoccupation, edicts, veiled threats, detachment and blunt instruction. He could very well not be there. This causes both boys to respond to him with a mix of outrage, incredulity and bitterness.

Its a rare film, well worth seeing, if for no other reason than to marvel at the elegiac force of the story, the photography and at the performances that the director managed to coax from his actors. Both the boys in particular are astonishingly subtle. Highly recommended.",1102377600,8,2539,4.87037037037037
2101203,3,B0002KQOH6,"Since a synopsis is redundant, I'll go straight to the review.  Though at times resembling Madonna's ""Frozen"" video, the beautiful shots that linger a few seconds too long and the quiet, tense atmosphere that speaks loudly about the tension between the characters make for an intriguing film.  The mystery of the father's return also draws you into finishing the film through to the end, in spite of the lulls in the action.

Unfortunately [for some], the openended-ness of the film's conclusion leaves an unsatisfying taste in your mouth.  I tend to like films that leave you thinking in the end, but for this film, the ambiguity was a bit too much.  I was greatly invested in the sons, wonderfully played by two very talented young actors, and wanted to see how their story played out.

So if you're looking for a tidy ending, go elsewhere.  But if you're looking for a beautiful postcard of Russia and a glimpse into the complicated workings of father-son relationships, check this film out.",1102291200,5,994,4.846153846153846
2101204,4,B0002KQOH6,"Moody, slow-going and atmospheric Russian film about a man returning to his wife and two sons after a long absence. He takes his sons on a long awaited fishing trip which becomes a strange odyssey of paternal bondage as his interest in the sons reaches psychological tension on the fringes of surrealism. The image of 'father' hangs over this film like a grey Russian sky, and it is only in the reuinion of the three that one understands the absence of the father in the son's lives. The two young actors playing the sons are remarkable, delivering almost uncanny acuracy as embittered and questioning children, but the rather dramatic ending seems an afterthought and besides the point.",1102118400,,687,4.880341880341881
2101205,5,B0002KQOH6,"THE RETURN is one of the most beautifully photographed, eloquent films about the influence of fragmented families this reviewer has ever seen.  Directed with extraordinary, understated, and sensitive perfection by Andrei Zvyagintsev, THE RETURN is a sweeping yet quiet epic story of a small family in Russia, fragmented by the father's desertion of them, and how the two boys and their mother cope with life alone and then with the unexpected arrival of the father after twelve years' absence.

Andrei (Vladimir Garin) is the older brother who runs with a gang that one day challenges his younger brother Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) to follow their game of jumping off a rickety tower into the lake below.  Unable to face the fear of dying, Ivan remains on the perilous tower while his 'friends' leave the 'coward' behind.  Eventually Ivan's mother (the beautiful and sensitive Natalya Vdovina) comes to fetch him and take him home to safety, despite Ivan's remaining feelings of rejection.

Abruptly, the boys return home on an average day to discover their mother's warning to be quiet so as not to awake their sleeping father (Konstantin Lavronenko) who has been gone for the important bonding years in the boys' lives.  Once awake the father menacingly tells the boys he will take them on a fishing trip.  Andrei (obviously out of the need to be loved by a father) is eager: Ivan (who fears the 'father' whom he knows only form old photographs) is wary and nearly refuses to go.  But go they do, and begin a few days of quiet discovery that their long absent father is a creature to be feared.

The three set camp and build a boat to take out to an island.  What happens on this misadventure is horrifyingly tragic and the boys are left to cope with fate, wholly on their own for survival.  And the film simply ends.

There is much more to the simple story than meets the eye (even though the eye is romanced with some of the most evocative, minimalist, atmospheric photography  of a lake in Siberia by cinematographer Mikhail Krichman).  Filial love or lack of same, sibling love, death, coming of age, coping with seemingly impossible ventures, etc fill every frame.  This is one of the most penetratingly cogent films made.  The acting is of the highest order. The musical score by Andrei Dergachyov quietly sets the mood to perfection.  It is sad to realize that the young actor Vladimir Garin (Andrei) drowned in an accident too similar to the diving scene that opens this film.  This event makes this film an even more powerful mood piece.  Highly Recommended.

While watching it I was mesmerized by the cinematography and the landscapes shown throughout the film. It was filmed in beautiful locations, inside and outside the city. I notices a few relegious references (the father is almost a christ-like figure), but at the time didn't think too much about them. Now I know there are even more in the film. Im not saying this is a religious film. I went to see it with a few friends and talked with others who saw it after watching it, and nobody noticed those references, which surprised me quite a bit. However its more than that, in the end the director doesnt give you all the answers, and it will be up to you to figure out what happened, if it actually did happen at all. You can see it as a religious film, as a film about the new and old Russia, or as a film about two brothers who never had a father and one day he comes back to show them important thing that will help them survive through life.
