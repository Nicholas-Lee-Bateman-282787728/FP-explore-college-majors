4021632,3,B002ZG988W,"This is the true story: In 19th century, people of Verona indicated a house as the residence of Juliet from William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Later, in 1937, it became a tradition to go to Juliet's grave in Verona and leave Juliet a letter about one's love problems. In 1990s the amount of letters reached astronomical proportions and a group of volunteers, who call themselves ""Club di Giulietta,"" took it upon themselves to answer each and every letter that's left for Juliet.

Enter Hollywood: A young woman named Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) on her pre-Honeymoon discovers a letter left unanswered since 1957 and decides to answer it. This sets in motion the entire movie and, lo and behold, the audience is following the film's characters through Italy's countryside in the search for one true love.

""Letters to Juliet"" is a cute romantic comedy that has some pretty scenery and captures of Verona, Italy. The movie is rather unrealistic but in a nice, harmless way that makes the most critical of us smile. Although the film never transcends beyond the fairy-tale, it's a sugar-sweet movie that leaves a pleasant feeling.

Amanda Seyfried struggles with the responsibility of carrying on a film as a leading lady and Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is miscast as the fiance that never has time for Sophie. It's up to the film's elders to make the story compelling and Vanessa Redgrave shines as the woman who wrote Juliet a letter and is moved to search for her long-lost true love after fifty years.",1273363200,81,1515,4.91015625

4022147,3,B002ZG988W,"Good movie if you just want to shut your brain off for 2 hours. SPOILER: Otherwise, don't waste time watching this, as the entire script is in the trailer.

Other annoying things about the movie:
- All the actors in the movie smile so unrealistically. Why would anyone who's being followed just smile so much and explain what they do?
- If you've been to Italy, you'll know that many people outside the tourist areas don't speak English as well as the movie portrays it.
- Victor's vocabulary is just so exaggerated to be limited. Does he only really know the words ""amazing"" and ""incredible,"" and can't make a  proper sentence without those words?
- SPOILER: Finally, the two people that we know will fall in love in the end, are two actors on the planet with ZERO chemistry. This makes the ""opposites attract"" love totally not believable, and just ruins the ending of the movie.",1515715200,,880,4.634615384615385

4022149,5,B002ZG988W,Perfect hit the spot love story with two happy endings. Keep tissue close by and be ready to sing along with Taylor Swift and Colbie Callait. It boosts that hopefulness that true love is out there if we have courage. Impeccable acting. Chris and Amanda are charming and develop adorable chemistry with one another. Chris' character is all of the chaos and genuineness that I've ever looked for a man to embody. I see myself in Amanda's character. Very relatable for those with the hopeless romantic or romance skeptic. ;),1515196800,2,521,4.8

My buddy and I do The Greatest Lie with Pete & Taylor podcast and we give one another movies that we enjoy that the other hasn't seen.
Now, we agree with one another when it comes to comic films but otherwise Taylor is into chick flicks and Im into action movies. So...he tossed me this turd.
Youll roll your eyes over and over. The dialogue is awful, the story is cliche and predictable. It isn't the worst movie hes given me but wow...nooooo",1512691200,,488,4.304347826086956

The love letter gets answered by a New Yorker, whose future hubby, an ambitious chef  trying to open his Italian restaurant in New York,  he is now too busy with suppliers during his pre-honey moon to really enjoy Italy with his bride.
Unexpectedly, an elderly woman arrives from London to Verona in reply to the letter,  looking for her lost true love from old letter, whom she left  waiting under ""their tree"" in 1950s, when she left for England, where she got married. The elderly lady is  escorted by her handsome but grumpy lawyer-grandson.

4022554,5,B002ZG988W,Time is the great healer and this film shows how a question is always answered. when we are ready to receive and answer from most high.  Following one's intuition is key as is the willingness to explore no matter how foolish it may appear to others. So much more to this like the power of name and how each with the same name chose to live it to their highest good or or not.

It's one of those movies that has such good dialogue and acting, that you can even watch it over and over again! They put the two young actors on the cover to make you want to buy it, and honestly, they are lovely to look at and can make you laugh, but truthfully, the acting by the grandmother and the old gentleman who was her lost love, is simply amazing. More so than the young lead actors. You know you're watching truly gifted actors when they have lines, even though time has past them by them by a bit. Sadly, I can't even name the older actors? But they're both tremendous at their craft, and they make you believe in true love again! Okay, so this is a girly movie, but I think guys can enjoy it too! It's like, a great movie to watch with a glass of wine, for a romantic night with someone you love!

4025328,5,B002ZG988W,"I rented Letters To Juliet for my wife and I to watch, it is a movie she had seen before and remembered liking.  This review is based on our collective assessment of the movie after watching it together.  The movie does suffer from a bit of predictability and is far from a big budget production being produced by the Hallmark Channel.  It gets 5 stars because it was a movie that wasn't perfect, but also was devoid of trashy politically charged material.  It was a simple romantic comedy that didn't try and be more than it was meant to be and in doing so hit the mark.  It was entertaining and cute with a happy ending, a great escape from the reality that drenches to many movies.  It might not of been a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan level story but it was still a movie we sat on the couch and watched together and enjoyed.  It left us with a smile on our face and the intent to record it on our DVR the next time it runs on Hallmark.  It was a nice move to spend time watching as a couple with decades of marriage under our belt who sometimes just need a little wholesome entertainment and laughs together.  I don't think Letters to Juliet will be winning a lot of awards, but it is what we wanted and expected and therefore a great movie.  If you don't mind a little bit of corny segments and just watch the movie to get away from the strains of real life it is very entertaining and leaves a smile on your face.",1468627200,,1409,4.185185185185185

4025471,1,B002ZG988W,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1192,4.8

Every girl remembers the story of Romeo and Juliet and wonder what they would do if they knew they would be without the man they loved for the rest of their lives, But the idea that the young man's grandmother has a simiar story that is a little more realistic makes this movie work, She's young, meets the handsome young Italian man on holiday but know she has to go back to her real life back in the UK, Now that her husband is gone she takes a chance and sees if that handsome young man is still there and maybe, just maybe, wants to give it a real chance this time, I like Amanda's character is the love cheerleader but (I forgot his name please forgive me) I like the grandson and his protectivness of his grandmother cause you can bet your booty I'd be no different. So if you are in the mood for a feel good romanctic movie go for it, I had to promise some after movie entertainment to get my man to watch it but by the end he liked it so much he both forgot and cried lol swear to God,",1463616000,,1137,4.057777777777778

Very sadly, we had to put up with Amanda Seyfried and Chris Egan who were wooden, predictable and horribly boring. I felt as if I was watching Barbie and Ken. Bad script, and Sofie's obnoxious American personality and predictably idiotic character, played by Seyfried, almost ruined the movie for me. I'd love to have an edited expanded version with just Redgrave and Nero, who are much more beautiful in their later years than the younger actors in their prime.",1458259200,,623,4.831775700934579

It made me wonder if she is like this in real life. It is hard to find a good PG film now days.  I wish we had more to choose from.

My mother in law, who is from Italy, loves this movie and had been talking about it a lot and how she really wanted me to see it and how it's loosely based on a true story (there are actually ladies who write back to people and they call themselves the Secretaries of Juliet). I tried to find somewhere to rent the  movie for her but couldn't find one so I checked here and found it at a great price. I surprised her with it one afternoon and we watched it together.

The key to its real success is Vanessa Redgrave's fantastic performance. She adds depth and reality to the script. I recommend watching her face as she watches the scenery. Her ability to capture how thoughts are presented without words is clearly the result of years of careful working of her craft. She makes this film more than just a romantic comedy.

4026596,3,B002ZG988W,"On the plus side, this movie serves up the most beautiful images of Italy. In fact, Italy is the star here. And I completely enjoyed all of the Italian actors who played smaller roles.  It's a pleasant, likeable, feel-good movie, and if that seems like damning with faint praise, that's because it is..  Very much a chick flick, which is not a put-down.  (And when did movies about relationships, feelings, romance come to be something to sneer at, anyway? )  There are no wizards here, no space aliens, no explosions, no threats to the future of the planet.  No violence at all.  The actors are all fine and Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, superb.  One exception is Christopher Egan, whose performance for most of the movie is over the top, which may be less inept acting than poor direction.

That being said, here's the downside:  It's going to remind you of a lightweight, made-for-tv romance of the type you can find on the Lifetime or Hallmark channel, just with a bigger budget.  The intrusive candy-pop music selections can't help but point you in that direction and make you think that perhaps it's targeted to junior high schoolers. I found myself wondering how Vanessa Redgrave had wandered into a piece of fluff like this.  The plot has more potential than substance as presented here and with each new development it's easy to predict what will happen next.  No real drama, yet no comedy either.  In fact, no tension, no suspense, no surprises, no energy or sizzle.  Which is why the best I can say about it is that it's okay.  Just okay.  But I would have been angry had I spent $10 or $12 to see it in a theater.

If you want to see a 'chick flick' that emotionally touches you, inspires you to think, has more than a passing impact, then I suggest you consider The Enchanted April or Mona Lisa Smile or the marvelous German film, Mostly Martha (the original, not the American remake).",1450656000,2,1900,4.607142857142857

This is a cute movie.  Its got a cute amanda seyfried.  Its got a song by Taylor Swift(Love Story).

It's a romantic light comedy..it really has no comedic parts.

If you couldn't figure out most of the plot...then you're very young or very naive.  LOL.  You should pretty much know the little surprises from common sense but for some reason, i just enjoyed the movie and was surprised a few parts here and there...but i shouldn't have been.

Maybe because of some other character development...it takes away from another romance that you'll end up cheering for...or not, if you aren't hoping for romance.  LOL.

4027928,2,B002ZG988W,"I typically love rom-coms. I even go along with cheesy story lines if the situation calls for it. However, this movie was hard to go along with. The plot never really seemed to flow and seemed forced. The actors had minimal chemistry, and it wasn't very believable. I ended up just joking about it with my husband the whole time. Grabbed a beer and started dubbing the conversations. It was more fun that way. It was a cute movie, but not the typical rom-com feel I was hoping for. In the past I have enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, Fools Rush In, Bridget Jones' Diary, Sleepless in Seattle, and even that selena gomez cinderella movie (and that's saying a lot!). Maybe if you're a teen you'd like this. I won't judge.",1432944000,,715,4.507692307692308

Letters to Juliet is a simple and beautiful story about finding romance and failing in love, but learning to try again for beautiful and true. It is a treasure to just be able to sink into a happy story and not be assaulted with abnormal psychology, crisis, anxiety and evil at every plot turn and commercial break.

This is a very sweet romance story and no matter how many times I watch it, it pulls at my heartstrings. I cry every time because the love story is beautiful and passionate. I don't believe I have ever watched a movie that has pulled at my emotions so much (but in a very good way!). You know it is well-written and well-directed if it can have that sort of effect on its viewers. It doesn't hurt that the movie is set in Italy and deals with Romeo and Juliet, which is perhaps one of the most romantic love stories of all time. Don't hesitate to pick up this movie but have a box of tissues waiting. I love this movie so much I have tried to find others like it that give me the same feeling but none of them even compare.

4029572,5,B002ZG988W,"This is one of the most wonderful romance stories made in the 21st century so far! Amanda Seyfried and the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero (who played Guinevere and Lancelot in the 1967 musical Camelot) star in this beautiful story about a young woman who finds a 50- year old letter to Juliet at Juliet's courtyard in Verona and as a journalist herself, she decides to write back to the lady who wrote it. To her surprise, the now older woman returns with her grandson, Charlie to Verona and the three of them trek around all of Tuscany to find her long lost Lorenzo. See it for yourself. It's INCREDIBLE. And what's more is that it's CLEAN you can watch this film with your grandma and your 10 year old daughter and not cringe, squirm or have the need to turn off the TV. A PG-rated romantic comedy with everything. An absolute must have.",1418774400,9,851,4.496774193548387

4029664,5,B002ZG988W,"I love Amanda Seyfried. This is the second time I watch this movie and I have to say I am a hopeless romantic. I was tears eyed in some parts.

We have Sophie, who is a fact checker but her passion is writing! She is engaged to an idiot who is pays more attention to food than her. (honestly he seems to always be thinking about food) and he doesn't seem interested in anything she says or does because he is always interrupted by the smell of food or a phone call.

There we have Charlie. He seems rude at first but then he grew on me. I loved his accent. He is Clair's grandson. He is cute.

After Sophie answers to Clair's letter of 50 years, they arrive in Verona and embark on a journey to search for her long lost love!

4030239,1,B002ZG988W,"This was, in most regards, your typical trite Hollywood romantic story. Most films such as this are hardly worth watching, not that savvy viewers ever expect much from such a film. I watched it only because we're planning a trip to Italy, and my wife thought it might be nice to have a bottle of wine, watch a meaningless film that didn't require any mental involvement, and enjoy the scenery of Italy. I suppose in that regard, Letters to Juliet didn't disappoint. Vanessa Redgrave does turn in a solid performance, but any benefit is offset by a horrible script, bad writing, and a leading lady in Amanda Seyfried, who simply can't act. She would be well advised to never step in front of a movie camera again. If she does, you'd be well advised never to watch her. This movie was a painful waste of time.",1412121600,,807,4.534246575342466

It's characters are true to life and very believable, and I love that the focus of the story isn't on a love triangle (though you see *some* of that too).

4033582,4,B002ZG988W,"Amanda Seyfried, Gael Garcia Bernal and Vanessa Redgrave present a special love story which is all because of letters left in a wall which is a tradition in a tiny town in Italy.  Amanda's character finds a letter dating back decades and she decides she will facilitate any possibility of love or at least closure for the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) who placed the letter in the wall.  Vanessa Redgrave is MUCH older by the time this occurs and much life has passed since the letter was placed in the wall.  Vanessa has a grandson who is extremely protective and a bit intense in his distrust of Amanda's motives, but these are only the main ingredients in a delightfully developing scenario where we witness many sweet scenes, a long line of disappointing events, but a love finale... or, so we think... love seems to overwhelm our characters so that we are given all the gratification this simple movie provides... a pleasure to watch and a feel-good for those with romance in their hearts.

I give it 4.5 stars and think it's something you might enjoy with a loved one, be it your beloved or just your mom or aunt who appreciates a story with romance as the main ingredient in this tender tale.  Enjoy!",1389139200,3,1202,4.624413145539906

4033830,5,B002ZG988W,"Don't care that it's predictable. .. love love love this movie! Fun, hopeful and well-done. Love and romance is usually depicted as the property of the young.  So nice to see it presented as a timeless part of life.",1385424000,,215,4.512820512820513

4033834,4,B002ZG988W,"The ""main"" romance in Letters to Juliet is about Sophie and Charlie.  It is a fairly standard ""girl engaged to wrong guy finds right guy"" plot line, though the acting is well done (and how can you go wrong filming in Tuscany?).

But I like the other two plot lines better.  For most of the movie, Vanessa Redgrave (Claire) has to romance the memory of Lorenzo. And she turns that memory into a person the audience wants to meet.  When the real Lorenzo finally does appear, Redgrave nails the hope, fear, boldness, and self doubt that are always part of such an important moment.

The other plot line I like is between Claire and Sophie.  They develop a mother-daughter relationship over the course of the movie.  Some of it is obvious (the hair brushing scene) and some is more subtle (Sophie frequently touches Claire's arm as reassurance).  But it is interesting to watch Claire and Sophie lovingly gang up on Charlie when he gets to be a bit much and then see Sophie and Charlie gang up to support Claire when she gets down.

Finally, the soundtrack includes the Italian version of ""I'm a Believer"".

Well acted, relatively complex plot, good music, lovely scenery, and sly jokes.  Letters to Juliet is a better than average romance.",1384300800,2,1236,4.675925925925926

It was like you could tell,though they were making a movie,they were also showing love for Vanessa Redgrave,a love for her once the camera was rolling and not rolling. As though they became family wrapping her in a cocoon of care and shelter so she could mourn and do her job as an actor and still have her privacy. It is a lovely movie. A caring,true to heart movie and I am happy that I  purchased it.  The acting by the  young actors was so believable. The older gentleman,Lorenzo as her  love from  50 years ago was so handsome and I waited with baited breath for them to find one another again.

The main character who has a likable but too busy to pay attention to her boyfriend ends up hooking up with a group that answers letters that people leave for Juliet at the site of her home in Verona. She answers someone who left a lover in the 1950s. The lady ends up returning to Italy to look for her lost love and the main character tags along with her to follow her and write her story. In the end, both of them end up having a romantic experience. This is a nice little romantic comedy with interesting characters and pretty scenery.

4034591,5,B002ZG988W,"Nothing like getting the big blocking obstacle out in the open even before the rompus quest and fun begins!  I wasn't so sure about this movie so I never attempted to watch it when it came out on DVD, and wasn't able to see it when it hit the movie theatres either.  I really thought, because of the PG rating, that there must have been, once again, either some profanity, suggestive scenes, or some so called ""Mild Violence"" (how can any violence be considered ""MILD"" anyway?), so I just decided ""It's not for me"" and never attempted to see it.  I am now quite sorry I did that, because recently, a dear friend gave me a DVD of it as a gift and after having it for about a week or two, I finally broke down and watched it, and I'm so very glad I did!  It was thoroughly enjoyable.  I didn't think it was ""funny"", though there were some amusing moments with back and forth ""verbal banter"" that volley's between Sophie and Charlie, and I felt there were a lot of ""missed"" moments that would have served greatly to show the growing but restrained ""interest"" each was developing towards the other, such as Charlie's seemingly arrogant aloofness and displeasure of and for Sophie and the whole ""Search For Lorenzo"" quest that increases slowly at first, but keeps moving quicker and quicker, into an awkward awareness for him of his own growing ""romantic"" feelings he's developing towards her and his battle of trying to suppress and not show it, should have found him stumbling a few times over his own inadequate attempts to do so.

  There were scenes that were deleted for stupid reasons that I feel would have added to the ""funny"" side of the movie, such as the ""Boating Lorenzo""!  That whole scene should have stayed in, and there should have been maybe two or three other such ""funny"" moments like that.  I feel there could have been more of Miss Redgrave becoming discerningly and acutely aware right away of the repress interest each of her young ""partners-in-quest"" were trying so hard to ""not"" show for the other, and her Motherly wisdom and intercession to bring their ""union"" about.  I also think more should have been done to help develop the relationship between Miss Redgave's ""Clare"" and Miss Seyfried's ""Sophie"".  I adored Mr Franco's and Mr Egan's character portrayals immensely.  Each played their Character's role perfectly as did Miss Regrave and Miss Seyfried as was also Gael Garcia Balan's (I'm not sure I got his last name right ... sorry Gael).  I watch this movie over and over again!!! I love it!!!

  *Slight side note: I didn't much like the pictures of women's exposed breasts in the lead up credits, nor the fact that Sophie goes on a ""Pre-Marital Honeymoon"" with Victor ... not a good moral ethic to be giving our already out of control promiscuous youth of today now is it and certainly does demean even further the sanctity of Marriage ... not everyone in this present society is as laxed in their views on love,marriage and sex ... but, I am also glad to see that except for one incident with Chris Egan's Charlie's response to Sophie's request to meet his Grandmother, there was no profanity!!! ... So, Thanks Hollywood, for making us movie goers and watchers a near perfectly decent movie!  Hope to see more with even more and higher quality and ""Decency""!",1370649600,,3290,4.652849740932642

Drew many comparisons to Under the Tuscan Sun -- but I found Letters to Juliet a bit less complicated and more innocent.

It definitely ties in Romeo and Juliet, which I believe makes it even more interesting. The settings in the movie are amazing real or fake they are stunning.

I was recently surprised to learn that the general premise of the movie is real-- that people who visit the traditional site of Juliet's house in Verona write letters to her about their love lives.

This is the kind of role Amanda Seyfried is perfect for - her character is snarky and strong, but with a vulnerable side that comes out as the movie goes along. And she is a hopeless romantic. Basically all the things most women want to be. :)

4035132,2,B002ZG988W,"This goes counter-current here, but this film struck me as an utterly boring and unoriginal romantic search.  Not only is it emotionally unconvincing, but you know exactly what is going to happen when she meets the boy.  Ambitious girl. Engaged.  Trip.  Connects.  Searches.  New boy.  Amazing discovery.  Sells story.  Back to old life.  Realizes mistake.  New love.

The only thing a bit fun in this is that the love whom Redgrave is seeking is in fact the Lancelot she met on the film set of Camelot, who became her partner in real life.  Aside from that, you can pass this one up and not know the difference.",1362355200,,612,4.607476635514018
4035133,4,B002ZG988W,I enjoyed this story in film. Vanessa Redgrave was very likeable for the first time to me. The storyline had pretty good values & I will view it again in the future as I am a person that buys with this in mind to enjoy more than once & be able to comfortably share it with others.,1362268800,,280,3.9298245614035086

4035135,5,B002ZG988W,"Letters to Juliet is a sweet and touching love story that will tug at your heart strings. It reminds us that true love does exist and miracles can happen at any time or place. I loved how the love story between Claire and Lorenzo became a springboard for the love story of Sophie, the main character. I loved this movie, and I definitely recommend for any romance fan.",1362182400,,368,4.426470588235294

4035159,4,B002ZG988W,"I like this sweet rom-com, but then I like a lot of rom-coms.  The most interesting part of the movie to me is the story of the women who answer the letters left for Juliet at the place that is thought to be her home.  They are such an interesting group of women, reading and answering letters of the lovelorn.  The main character of this story has her own love problems.  She has little in common with her fiance, who is more interested in business than in her.  She answers one letter to Juliet that was actually left decades ago.  The woman who wrote the original letter to Juliet then shows up to thank her for her considered and kind response, even if it is quite delayed.  And a romantic adventure in Italy starts.  This movie is not deep or particularly stellar in any way.  Still it's sweetness and gorgeous cinematography wins me every time.",1361404800,,850,4.432258064516129

Lovely Italian scenery, good acting from all of the characters, and the never-tiring story of finding true love fill this movie with the viewer's desire to see everyone happily ensconced with their own true love, and it's essentially exactly what transpires throughout the length of the film.  Nicely done, with tenderness, sensitivity, and emotional tension all thrown in together.  Nice chik flik.",1359936000,,608,5.0
4035259,5,B002ZG988W,"Amanda Seyfried is a favorite young actor of mine.  I think she is underrated in the business, and she does a lovely job here of a writer finding her way where she really belongs.

4035261,5,B002ZG988W,What a concept to keep the story written by Shakespeare alive in modern times.  The journey of searching through the country for 'the One' who makes your life complete and ultimately find him... is true romance.,1359331200,,211,4.861111111111111

4035264,5,B002ZG988W,"My wife loves the movie.  Vanessa Redgrave is absolutely masterful. Italy is memorably beautiful, especially on Blu-ray.  Still, I was a little cool to the movie until I grabbed a bottle of red wine, sat back and watched it again with my wife.  The movie is definitely romantic and  predictable, but the red wine made all the difference.  I can't think of another movie that tastes best with wine, but wine is the perfect complement to the flick.  Every one of my movie friends who saw the movie and didn't care to watch it again I recommended they try it again with their favorite red wine.  They all agreed the wine was a perfect addition and they will always open a bottle when they pop Letters to Juliet in the player.",1358899200,,722,4.465648854961832

That was the point it was base of Romeo and Juliet and their crazy romance. And they did a wonderful job.

This was definitely a ""feel good"" movie with a wonderful cast and two very romantic story lines all leading up to a heartwarming HEA ending for both couples. (My husband also enjoyed this movie and he seldom likes romantic comedies -- my favorite genre -- enough to watch them twice, but he did this time!) A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and I am very grateful to her so I will pass the recommendation along.

4035335,2,B002ZG988W,"I love romantic movies and my favorite ones have something or other to do with Italy (""Only You"", ""For Roseanna"" and ""While You Were Sleeping"" which isn't set technically set in Italy, but the main character wanted to go there).  This movie did nothing for my romance-loving self.  The two main love interests had no detectable chemistry with each other and were just plain bland.  I thought it was really weird that this movie had some similarities to ""Mama Mia"" (Amanda Seyfried plays a Sophie in both movies and some of the characters said/did similar things to ""Mama Mia"").  Can't understand the praises for Vanessa Redgrave - she moved and acted way too slow.  She looked really frail.  I think she was just too old for the part.  Then again, Betty White is way old and she's all kinds of awesome.  Vanessa Redgrave, along with the rest of the cast were just so vanilla!!",1356739200,,876,4.642857142857143

4035562,5,B002ZG988W,"My sister-in-law recommended this movie to me because she knows I adore good movies. Well, I loved it so much that I purchased 2 copies: one from Amazon.com and the second one from Walmart because Amazon wasn't deliverying it to my address fast enough. ""Letters To Juliet"" is a compelling love story. A love story that is told through the eyes of the old and young.

Christopher Egan is an excellent choice for Amanda Seyfreid's love interest. The two of them appear matched in Heaven with their perfect good looks and classic charm. And it doesn't hurt that they look appealing on screen. Egan is really growing as an actor, already having starring roles in movies like the dark,suspenseful ""Crush"" and he shines even better in this one. Seyfreid is the perfect match for him in casting. She already has skills under belt, coming from her other love story hit, ""Dear John"" with Channing Tannum. She's the one to watch for years to come.

And let's not forget the real star of this movie. The queen herself, Miss. Vanessa Redgrave. Personally, she has experienced major hardships: the death of her talented daughter, Natasha Richardson, the daughter of director, Tony Richardson, and then her only sister, the unforgettable Lynn Redgrave, but her talent still reigns in this one as her character sets out to find her true love in this remarkably funny, but touching romantic masterpiece.

I think most women understand that ""WHAT IF?"" is one of the hardest things to live with and sometimes no matter the consequence you just HAVE to do the ""what if"" and find the answer. Whatever that answer may be.  And in this movie you get to tag along as Vanessa Redgrave does just that.

It's absolutely charming as heck!! And the Italian towns/countryside etc makes me want to go there NOW (and never leave). I enjoyed all the characters and the acting was wonderful but Vanessa Redgrave is probably my biggest draw as far as they go.

She writes anyway and the women (played by the indelible Vanessa Redgrave) shows up with her grandson detailing she's a widow and wants to find out what happened to her Italian love. This is a charming tale which leaps from American to Italy but spends about 85% of its time in the latter. Vanessa Redgrave is brilliant, dominating various scenes and playing the part of the grandmother that many of us wish we had had growing up. The themes on love are done well, the Italian countryside is breathtaking and there is an overall lovely fantasy feel to the movie. It's hard to hate anyone in this film and the humor had some funny takes. The ending is predictable but the audience wants it that way so nobody but the deepest of cynics should feel ripped off. This film was the last one for its director before he died of brain cancer. It cost $30M and the box office yielded roughly $80M. It was based on non fiction novel about women leaving letters to the Shakespearean Juliet. STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; LOVE THEMES: B to B plus; HUMOR: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid September 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B plus. BEST DIALOGUE: Dear Juliet, I didn't go to him, Juliet. I didn't go to Lorenzo. His eyes were so full of trust I promised I'd meet him and run away together because my parents don't approve. But, instead, I left him waiting for me below our tree - waiting and wondering where I was. I'm in Veronoa now. I return to London in the morning and I am so afraid. Please, Juliet tell me what I should do. My heart is breaking and I have no one else to turn to. Love, Claire ///// Dear Claire, ""What"" and ""If"" are two words as non-threatening as words can be. But put them together side-by-side and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your life: What if? What if? What if? I don't know how your story ended but if what you felt then was true love, then it's never too late. If it was true then, why wouldn't it be true now? You need only the courage to follow your heart. I don't know what a love like Juliet's feels like - love to leave loved ones for, love to cross oceans for but I'd like to believe if I ever were to feel it, that I will have the courage to seize it. And, Claire, if you didn't, I hope one day that you will. All my love, Juliet //// Charlie doesn't approve, which makes it all the more fun.",1316736000,,2515,4.2746331236897275

This is one of those films that you already know where it's going when the opening credits roll, so really, there's no use whining about its predictability.  It's decent enough.  Lynn Redgrave lends some credibility to the fluff. Frankly, her story could have been expanded and they could have 86'd the other one.  Scenery is beautiful.  Storyline appropriately contrived for a rom-com.  The two younger lovers have decent enough chemistry throughout the usual hate at first sight, oh really, deep down they're sensitive and soul mates thing.  A small saving grace in the otherwise-expected storyline is that at least they didn't make the Sophie's boyfriend a total ass.  One the down side, I had to laugh that the film's opening moments presents the very famous WWII Life Times Square photograph as one of ""true love"" when in it was actually a fabulous spontaneous moment between two complete strangers  (which, of course, makes Sophie look like the world's crappiest ""fact checker"" but heck, why let reality interfere with a  storyline).

Because Victor will be too busy after the wedding with his new business, the couple decides to take a pre-honeymoon to Italy. Little does Sophie realize how much business Victor plans for this trip until after they arrive. Not too discouraged at the beginning, Sophie plans to use her time away from Victor to write. My guess was that she wanted her work published in The New Yorker.

While Victor is off meeting with suppliers, visiting wineries, cheese shops and other places to help his upcoming business, Sophie decides to go off on her own sightseeing where she happened upon an alley. There she discovered Juliet's balcony, made famous by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. These letters were collected daily and a group of women known as the Secretaries of Juliet would reply back--very much like the US version of Dear Abby only the theme here was issues of the heart.

Sophie, looking for a story, decides to help and stumbles across a hole in the wall where a letter had been left more than fifty years ago. She decides to respond back and believes that the rest will remain a mystery. Imagine her surprise when the lady's grandson, Charlie, (played by Christopher Egan) shows up. He isn't there to thank her either. He's angry because his grandmother (played by Vanessa Redgrave) has it in her mind to find her lost love, Lorenzo Bartollini. Soon the three embark on a sometimes comical, sometimes sad journey about true love.

I loved everything about the movie, but my favorite character was Victor, who wasn't Italian but pretended to be. Though he was made to be the bad guy here, I found his role hilarious.

4035824,1,B002ZG988W,"There are certain films that just cannot overcome the obstacle set before them by the prose suggested on the outset of the film.  It is a gigantic hurtle to overcome, beings that it is something that can cause individuals to roll their eyes uncontrollably and get up to use the restroom even when they have no need to.  It will cause people to stare at their watches and make silent prayers to the movie gods for the film to just END.

That obstacle is, quite simply, stupidity.

In the end, that is the biggest problem to be found with `Letters to Juliet'.  It is problematically clich&eacute;d and predictable and, above all else, it is stupid.  It is preposterous, and to the point where it cannot rebound from its ridiculous developments.  There is absolutely nothing about this film that makes any sense, and because of that one is left simply NOT CARING about anyone involved.  I see a lot of positive reviews for this film (which baffles me) and they I read the reviews and see that many are taking a more sympathetic approach simple because this stars the glorious Vanessa Redgrave.  Don't get me wrong; I LOVE HER, and I strongly consider her one of the finest actresses we've ever had the pleasure of watching do anything.  Even at her ripe age, she is still delivering impeccable performances; and this is no exception.  If anything could have been capable of pulling this dud out of the mire it was Redgrave, and she truly was an inspired casting decision and she made the most of her every moment (I was rooting for her to get that sentimental Oscar nomination that some on the internet were talking about).  She is great; but sadly the rest of the film is far from it.

So, quickly, here are my main issues...

The dialog is soap operatic in that it doesn't even sound like real people would ever say these things.  The relationships between individuals has absolutely no shading; no truth.  Sophie and her boyfriend would never exist within the same circle, and their `non' relationship is an insult to the audience (they wouldn't have made it past date-one).  The relationship between Sophie and Charlie isn't any better...in fact his whole character was unbearable.  The `lovey' connotations heaped upon every sequence of events felt forced and unnatural, and the way that Sophie's past was explored felt extremely underdeveloped.  I mean, if you are going to throw that weight our way, at least have the decency to make it feel like more than a manipulative plot device.

Sometimes predictable fairytale endings work, but in order to make the cheesy and upended ridiculousness of these kinds of films work you really need to WORK at it.  `Letters to Juliet' puts in no real effort and it shows.

All hail Vanessa Redgrave, but next time put her in a better movie!",1310342400,2,2781,4.714285714285714

4035855,2,B002ZG988W,"This is one of those films where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.  No suprises, no twists.  Here's the rundown: Girl [Sophie] travels to Italy with her fiancee (who looks eerily like Balki Bartagamousse from the '80's sitcom Perfect Strangers)completely ignores her beause he is obsessed with finding the best wine/cheese/truffles for use in his soon-to-be-opened NYC restaurant.  Girl finds a letter to Juliet written 50 years ago, and commits to helping it's author [Claire, played by Vanessa Redgrave] find her long-lost love (which she does).  Girl fights with Claire's J. Crew modelesque grandson/chaueffer, which means (of course) that the two will fall in love by the film's end (which they do).  There - I just saved you ten bucks.

For a ""romantic comedy"", it sure was lacking both ""comedy"" and ""romance"".  Oddly enough, the older couple [Claire and her reunited love, Lorenzo] had more sizzle than the younger people in the film, who had so little chemistry that you can't even tell that they're falling ""in love"" (aside from a random kiss in the middle of the flick) until they verbally declare it out of nowhere in the last 10 minutes of the movie.  It's all very predictable and harmless, and I've seen worse films, but this one's nothing to write home about.  It's hard to know who to blame here:  The writers?  Director? Actors?  Maybe a little of each?  In any case, the result is about as exciting as a stale corn tortilla.

I give it two stars because the sceneary [Italian countryside] is absolutely stunning, and having visited Italy, it brought back memories of how beautiful a place it is.  So I guess if you just want a vacation for the eyes, you can watch this film on mute.",1307923200,,1716,4.769491525423729
4035856,4,B002ZG988W,"The storyline in Letters to Juliet may be unrealistic and even sappy, but I found it an engaging and charming watch nevertheless. It doesn't hurt that the movie is mainly set in the beautiful countryside of Verona, Italy and the gorgeous cinematography is one of the major highlights of this movie. Aspiring writer Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is engaged to be married to chef and budding entrepreneur Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal). The pair travel to Italy for a vacation but each is consumed by work, leaving little time for each other. Then Sophie finds a 50-year-old note addressed to Shakespeare's Juliet, and takes it upon herself to answer it. When the woman who wrote the note discovers it, Sophie finds herself being swept up in a real life romantic quest to discover the recipient of the note.

Claire, the genteel woman who wrote the note is played by the majestic Vanessa Redgrave, who always manages to light up the screen in any role she plays, even if it is not a major role. Claire is accompanied on her quest by both Sophie, who is happy to tag along as she finds inspiration for her writing, and Claire's cynical grandson,Charlie, who grudgingly accompanies his grandmother. The trio search for the elusive Lorenzo, whom Claire met as a young teen of fifteen almost fifty years earlier.

The movie worked for me because of the credible interplay between the three main characters. Amanda Seyfried is lovely and charming and plays her role earnestly while sharing a credible chemistry with Charlie (Christopher Egan). The two young people contrast nicely with the aging yet graceful Claire who has much wisdom to impart even as she herself makes new discoveries about the power of love to bring about change. This wonderful interaction between the cast coupled with the magnificent backdrop of Verona, Italy makes for a lovely romantic drama. I recommend this movie for those who love romance dramas set in Italy, and also recommend my personal favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Tuscan-Sun-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0000VD02Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted-April/dp/B004SIP7D0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted April</a>.",1307664000,,2328,5.784256559766764

'Sophie' wears shorts to accompany the elegant 'Claire' who is searching for her 'Lorenzo'.  Shorts!  in Italy!  'Sophie' should never have been let out of Orange County, CA she is so utterly clueless as to culture and place.

She also sounds as though she is 11 years old -- not to insult 11-year-olds who are able to survive without saying, ""Awesome,"" and would know how to dress and act appropriately, and not inflict themselves on someone too much a lady to shun her.

It would not matter, however, if the role was played by a different actress.  The writer, or, I hope, more probably, the studio demanded this horrific portrayal of an American idiot without one iota of passion, or genuine interest in anything, or respect for another country's traditions. 'Sophie' is the classic, stereotypical ugly American through and through.

There is no reason to watch this movie, even for the scenery, (although all non-lead supporting characters are charming), as any scenes of Italy are destroyed by the presence of the clueless wonder.

What a total waste of time.

The only actor who was at least real and natural was Victor.

Claire was nauseatingly sweet and smiley.

Sofie and Charlie knew each other for how many days? 3? And for 2.5 of those they don't even like each other? And then they fall deeply madly and passionately in love.
How UN-romantic and STUPID is that?

What kind of a girl wears a skimpy outfit and lies down in the grass beside a boy she doesn't hardly know...and then kisses him...when she is engaged. And doesn't even seem to feel bad about it.

Sofie breaks up with Victor in his restaurant in the middle of the day in front of others?

I didn't like her character at all. She didn't appreciate Italy either. Whenever they drove anywhere she didn't look out the window once.

4035920,4,B002ZG988W,"Brief summary: Sophie and her fiance, Victor, go to Verona Italy, home of Juliet.  While he looks after dealers to help his restaurant business she gets involved with answering letters to Juliet and finds a 50 year old letter.  She writes back and inspires Claire to come to Italy and seek her ""true love"" despite the decades that have passed and the protests of her grandson, Charlie and wait for it . . . Charlie and Sophie end up falling in love as they search for her Grandmother's long lost lover.  First, the good: Amanda Seyfried as Sophie.  She does a great job and is incredibly likable and there is some depth to her character.  Also great is Vanessa Redgrave as Claire.  She is believable and very likable and manages to be attractive and graceful in her pursuit of love as a grandmother.  The four secretaries to Juliet are very likable and fun and you wish they had more scenes in the movie.  The ending scene is actually touching even though you know the outcome.  The OK: yes, you can guess the ending and there are predictable turns as the story moves along but overall it is enjoyable story.  The  bad: there is really nothing Gael Garca Bernal can do with the character Victor.  Sophie's fiance is a plastic figurine absolutely obsessed/possessed with his restaurant and food in general.  If he even smells food he completely ignores the beautiful Amanda Seyfried/Sophie and is so unlikable you want to hit him as he sniffs like a starving rat after every morsel of food or wine.  If you go to Italy with someone as stunning as Amanda Seyfried and had any inkling of feelings towards her you would not leave her for a minute much less completely ignore her.  Also not so great is Christopher Egan's character of Charlie.  I am sure there are a lot of deleted scenes which they were forced to cut which actually developed his character a little more.  As it is, he moves from annoying nay sayer to charming Romeo a little too quickly.
  Overall, a fun, if not predictable romantic comedy, that is definitely worth watching (which romantic comedies aren't predictable in some sense).  The leading lady performances are also worth watching.",1297641600,,2155,4.680851063829787

4035924,4,B002ZG988W,"A[...] I love Romantic Comedies!!  Especially ones shot in lovely foreign cities with beautiful landscapes and amazingly classic architecture.  Sophie (a name which has made quite the resurgence in recent years), played by the beautiful Amanda Seyfried is a fact checker for the New Yorker with the ambition of becoming a writer for the mag.  She is engaged to the passionate and easily distracted Victor (played enthusiastically by Gael Garcia Bernal), a soon to be restaurateur in New York.  The two embark on a pre-honeymoon trip to Italy to both meet suppliers for Victor's restaurant and to site-see together.  But guess what?  Victor and his passion for food has overshadowed Sophie and the sites of Italy.

So what's a girl to do?  Go off alone and visit the old digs of the most tragic heroine of all love stories'- the home of Juliet Capulet.  Where love-lorn females from all over the world leave letters for Juliet and hope for an answer.  I think most of you know where the film goes after that - Sophie finds an old letter from the 50's and, under the guise of being one of ""Juliet's secretaries, ""has"" to write a response.  Her letter fuels a trip to find lost love, while giving our main characters a chance to find themselves...

All romantics must see this film!  Yes it was cheesy (complete with scaling castle walls and white horses).  Yes it was predictable.  But it was also beautifully shot with likable characters.  And call me easy, but that makes it a must-see film.  I was fully engaged with the characters and their conflicts in this movie.  I appreciated the two versions of Sophie we got to see.  She was sweet and a little bit of a push-over at work and with her fianc, but assertive and unshakable in her position with Charlie (played by Christopher Egan) , the overprotective grandson of Claire (Vanessa Redgrave looking quite striking) who wrote the letter from the 50's.  Can I just say how friggin beautiful Amanda Seyfried is?  She looks like she jumped out of a fairytale story with her blond hair and fabulous pout.

Anyway, I believe that with romantic comedies you always know how it will end up, you simply must enjoy the ride, and Letters to Juliet is quite the pleasant ride of human characters and satisfying encounters.  For fans of this genre, you won't be disappointed.",1297036800,,2316,4.720698254364089

4036491,5,B002ZG988W,"So I love cheesy chick flicks.  As a warning to most, this probably causes me to rate the genre higher than most would.  But I think the most important thing is entertainment, and especially with this film, I find them vastly entertaining.  In a world full of so many romantic movies, Letters to Juliet really does stand out for me.

Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a fact checker for the New Yorker.  Her real dream is to be a writer, but for now she enjoys her work and is quite good at it.  However, now is a time for her to take a break from work.  She and her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), a chef embarking on opening a restaurant, are taking a trip to Italy as a sort of pre-honeymoon.  Sophie and Victor have very different ideas for their trip though.  She is interested in sight seeing the area and local attractions, while he is more interested with the food and meeting with vendors for his restaurant.  They sort of drift in different directions while they find things that interest them on their trip.

Sophie drifts to Juliet's house in Verona.  There she discovers a wall in which people from all over the world write to Juliet to ask for advice on their relationships (perhaps its just me but I find it a bit amusing that they would write to Juliet in this matter seeing how her relationship turned out).  She becomes immersed with discovering the story behind this wall, especially when she sees a young woman take all the letters away in a basket.  To her surprise, she finds a group of women who have taken it upon themselves to answer every letter that is left for Juliet.  She tags along the next few days and finds a very old letter stuck behind a loose brick.  Its from a lady named Claire and she had written it fifty years before.  Inspired, Sophie writes back to her.

She is ever surprised when in the same week, dashing angry Charlie (Christopher Egan) shows up and berates her for writing the letter.  She learns from him that his grandmother Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) received the letter and was inspired to come search for the true love she had left all those years ago.  They travel the country in search of Lorenzo (Franco Nero) despite the fact that there are many Lorenzo's listed in the area.  It begins a wonderful road trip for them and even though Sophie and Charlie argue and disagree on the trip, they both learn the value of searching for true love.

I thought most of the characters in this movie were well cast.  Although he doesn't have a large part, Nero played Lorenzo with true passion and affection and it was very sweet to watch him interact with Claire.  Redgrave as Claire was also wonderful.  She had such a longing in her acting and I really did think she was searching for a lost love in true life.  Sophie was interesting, she could be a bit cold at times, but she had true emotions and wanted the best for the situation, despite the fact that she was using it to write about.  I was a bit disappointed in Charlie.  He came off abrasive through much of the film and it was hard to like him or understand his complete turn around toward the end as it didn't seem genuine.  I also felt sorry for Victor as a character.  Personally I would have loved exploring his Italy with all its wonderful chances at eating delectable food, but alas, that was not what this story was about.

While the plot could be called predictable, I thought it was great.  I had a few tears in my eyes at time and was truly touched by the movie.  It started off a bit slow, but was well worth sticking through and watching the entire movie.

The music fit very well with the movie.  It ranged from Italian pop, to slow ballads and even some Taylor Swift.  Every piece matched perfectly the scene in which it was played.  Another beautiful thing in the movie was the scenery.  Italy is definitely gorgeous and this movie did a great job of showing off the wonder that is the area.

It was definitely a charming romance and one I plan on watching again and again.  Those who don't like chick flicks probably won't enjoy it, but even if you only have a slight taste for the genre, its one of the better ones to watch.

4036560,2,B002ZG988W,"Oh how a genre has fallen. I'm 27, so I grew up with Pretty Woman, Sleepless in Seattle, While You Were Sleeping, You've Got Mail, etc. I also love the classic Hollywood ones like My Man Godfrey, Bachelor Mother, The Shop Around the Corner / In The Good Old Summertime, The Apartment, etc. As an 80s baby/90s teen, I love Ten Things I Hate About You, Clueless, and She's All That.  What Hollywood churns out now and refers to as RomComs leave a lot to be desired. `The Holiday' might have been my last enjoyable romcom.

I rented `Letters to Juliet', and I am not impressed. I turned it off a few minutes ago (didn't finish it) and figured I'd write a review while it's fresh. First off, the previews didn't really appeal to me, so I knew I'd wait til On Demand or Netflix had it. Anyway, I pop it in and w/o fully knowing what it's about, I can see where it's going. It's the total clich of the young New Yorker (who's also a writer), a fianc who is clearly not right for her, international trip, interest in someone else's life, verbal sparring with a handsome guy....LOVE.  Now to be fair, these are common elements of a romcom, but it's about the delivery. For me, LTJ did not deliver.

One reason is that I didn't find Sophie to be relatable.  I didn't find myself rooting for her and I didn't find her motivations very believable. I don't buy AS as a romantic comedy lead. It was clear it wasn't going to work out w/the fianc and I don't think his character was needed. There was no chemistry with Charlie either and this plays into my gripe with the new romcoms. The leads don't have chemistry! It's as if they just pick an attractive guy and girl, and don't try to sell the movie.  One of the big things in romcoms is the two leads start off not liking each other, verbally sparring, something happens to ""open"" their eyes to each other, and then they fall in love.  Nowadays, not only do they not have chemistry, but the sparring isn't funny or witty, the characters come off as crabby and unpleasant (especially the guys), and it's just hard to believe that they'd fall for each other. Shop Around the Corner, In The Good Old Summertime, and You've Got Mail are all the same movie, but all three sets of leads sold the stories. Jimmy/Margaret, Judy/Van, Tom/Meg all played their roles naturally and made you want them to end up together.  You could also see the moment where they discovered that thing about the other person that made them fall in love. This movie lacked that. One minute they were fighting, and the next, they were into each other. Where was the transition? Where was that moment when their eyes connected, and we just knew? Heck, `Beauty and the Beast' got it right and wrote a song about it (`Something There That Wasn't There Before'). I just don't feel they sold it, but being a romcom, they had to get together.

There was also no humor.  I kept wondering when I was going to laugh. Wasn't looking for slapstick, just something to make me crack a smile. I ended up giving up on the film. Turned it off and opted for the Wiki plot summary. I really like Vanessa Redgrave, but I couldn't make it through the film. Romantic comedies are good because they are light and fun, and if the delivery is right, the predictability doesn't bother me. Sometimes I like seeing happy endings and I even like when the endings may not be so happy but are believable (My Best Friend's Wedding), but there's something wrong when I could care less what happens to the characters.

I have to admit that I was a bit concerned that this was going to be little more than a predictable and formulaic romance story.

That's the biggest selling point.  I also have to admit that I've been a Vanessa Redgrave fan for a while, and her role sealed the deal for me with this movie.

This movie is appropriate for the entire family.  Well, little children won't like it, but there's nothing on screen that you would need to worry about if you were watching and they were in the room with you.

.
The story is about wanna-be writer Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) who goes to Verona, Italy with her neglectful fiancee (played by Gael Garcia Bernal). While in the city made famous for being the setting of ""Romeo and Juliet"", Sophie discovers a group of women who have made it their jobs to answer letters written by love-sick woman looking for romantic help from Juliet. Sophie discovers a letter written 50 years ago and decides to answer it. This kicks off a series of events where Claire, the 65 year old letter writer (played by Vanessa Redgrave), follows Sophie's advice and returns to Verona to look for her first love.

The movie follows the adventures of Sophie and Clarie's grandson Charlie (played by Christopher Egan) as they help Claire to find her long lost love and discover love and adventure of their own.

All the actors are just a backdrop for the real star of this movie - the city of Verona and the surrounding countryside. The scenes of Italy in this movie are just beautiful.

Sensitively directed by Gary Winick, the heart and humanity in the storytelling shines through.
This film really does make you think about the meaning of love and companionship and how important they really are in life.
The central message - having the courage to follow your dreams and your heart, and taking the chances that life throws up, is a wonderful message for our times.
I loved the character journey's woven into the script - the idea that we see things around us that cause us to change and grow, that often we need to allow others to show us the way and sometimes we have to make mistakes in order to realise where our passions really lie.
Love really does have no age, a message which the two parallel love stories remind us of so clearly. This is an uplifting film (with some great cinematography) which will move you to tears more than once, and a movie which gives everybody hope that true love never fades and celebrates the basic good that lies within us all.
Oh, by the way - I'm a guy who does not usually watch this kind of film, but  absolutely loved this.
A quick thought on the final scene, which seems to have come in for some criticism.  It's a romantic comedy - is it not SUPPOSED to have an element of fantasy? That's the magic of movies, surely.
If we find it difficult to appreciate the storytelling here then, maybe we have to consider, that may say more about us, than it does about the director's ability to balance the emotion of the love story with the fantasy element of the comedy.
For what its worth, I thought the balance Gary struck was very much in the spirit of the movie.  Maybe we don't watch enough 1950's rom-coms these days, or maybe we really aren't as romantic as we'd like to think.",1289347200,3,1844,4.498507462686567
4036656,4,B002ZG988W,"Homies, a helpful hint: If you ever holiday someplace romantic with your chica, do not, for the love of all that is good, ever, ever leave her to her own devices while you go do your own thing. Case in point, the guy in this movie, Victor - a passionate chef and engaged to beautiful Sophie Hall - all Victor seems to care about whilst in picturesque Verona is attending all these cooking seminars. In his skeevy passive aggressive way - he offers to ""not attend but it'll be missing an opportunity"" - he ends up leaving Sophie to her own devices. Chef should've listened to my helpful hint.

LETTERS TO JULIET is a travelogue of the lush Italian countryside as much as it is a romantic comedy about characters who follow their hearts and have grand adventures while racking up petrol money. This is heart-on-its-sleeve cinema, the sort which steeps itself in unlikely dialogue such as: ""I'm sorry, I didn't know true love had an expiration date."" and ""Grazie, destino."" And the production company must've scampered off with all the rude Italians and locked them away because the locals here are across the board welcoming and charming, and it makes me wanna go visit. Sophie Hall travels to Verona with her oblivious fiance on what is intended to be a pre-honeymoon jaunt. Instead of paying attention to her, the fiance waxes rhapsodic about cheeses and mushrooms. When she offers to do her thing while he does his thing, he calls this a ""Win, win"" situation. You can't see me but I am shaking my head right now. I am wise in the matters of the heart.

Sophie is a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, but she aspires to be a writer. Serendipity arrives when Sophie, in one of her solitary walks in Verona, chances upon Juliet's Courtyard (yes, that Juliet!), on which walls brokenhearted women have posted their lovelorn, sometimes tear-stained letters. We then set eyes on the Secretaries of Juliet, women volunteers who collect these letters every day and then respond to them (and this makes me want to pick up the book this film is based on). When Sophie finds a 50-year-old letter hidden away in the wall, she embarks on an unforgettable journey, with the letter's author Claire and Claire's priggish grandson Charlie as her companions. Or, actually, she tags along while Claire goes off on her quest for lost love while Claire's grandson casts disapproving glances her way. Too much time on their hands? Maybe. Too starry-eyed? Without a doubt. But Italy will do that to you, rob you blind of your senses.

Something about LETTERS TO JULIET allows you to be swept away. The glorious scenic locales inhabit this movie, and they invite you to buy into the mood and the tone. I honestly didn't think Amanda Seyfried and Chris Egan exhibited that much chemistry, although Seyfried is wonderful and pitch perfect in her role, but Egan left me unengaged, sorry to say. The two leads' characters have a prickly first meeting, so that's promising. But then the story doesn't go to demonstrate enough of Charlie's development from cynical cold fish to British gent in love. But never mind. The casting coup is in landing Vanessa Redgrave, and she is simply exquisite as the wistful Claire. She makes you long for the things that happen in this movie to happen in real life. For those incurable romantics who tend to swoon over Audrey Hepburn and Clark Gable, LETTERS TO JULIET delivers a similar whiff. See it for that and for the idyllic landscapes and for Amanda Seyfried and, mostly, for Vanessa Redgrave. And, remember, romantic holiday - stick to your girl like glue. Squirrely things happen if you don't.

4036689,3,B002ZG988W,"Earlier this year, I saw the movie ""Letters to Juliet"" on the big screen at the movie theatre and enjoyed it a lot...at the time. Then I read the book on which the movie was based...and as a result, my view of the movie has changed dramatically.

Hence the reason for this review.

When you compare the two, and despite the attempt by the moviemakers to have a strong tie in between the book and the movie...it becomes alarmingly apparent one is not at all related to the other...and I found that quite disappointing. I felt cheated... as though I had been offered a mediocre fast food meal with diet pop when I could've (and should've) had a five course gourmet feast, complete with fine vintage wine.

If I had a chance to ask the filmmaker and screenwriter some questions, I'd ask first of all, why didn't they follow the book more closely? Next, I'd ask why did they create an unrelated storyline with fictitious two dimensional characters when there was plenty of intriguing real life stories already in the book that they could've been developed? Is Hollywood truly that risk aversive that have to stick with the template even when it's clear it's not all that appropriate for the story?

To me, it's as though the people involved with this film overlooked a 24K diamond at Tiffany's in favor of cubic zirconium from Wal-Mart. I would've LOVED to have seen a romantic movie that was montage of those real life stories, or at least based on some of those stories brought to film rather than coming up with fictitious characters. Ok...maybe it would've been taking a risk into crossing into ""art house"" territory, but it would've been much more interesting...and ultimately enduring.

It seems to me an opportunity was missed here.

Instead of making a truly beautiful film that could've been one that was unique and special, the makers of ""Letters To Juliet"" went for the typical Hollywood box office ""sure thing"" and got all formulaic on us and made yet another status quo rom-com... almost indistinguishable from the others. Sure it made money, and people liked it but let's face it because of the compromise...Letters to Juliet will never be considered the classic it could've and should've been.

Now there are some positives of the movie, however...

I loved the storyline with Claire/Lorenzo, the couple separated by 50 years. So nice to see more and more storylines in movies with age appropriate romantic partners who are over age 50...and I thought was especially cool when I read how the real life actors, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero, have a similar love story to the movie. It seems that Art does truly imitate life, eh?

I wasn't at all enamored with the ""romance"" between Sophie and Charles. I felt it was superficial and yes, predictable. To me, Charles had very little going for him apart from his Prince William good looks...and his cynicism was annoying.  At least Victor the restauranteur was truly passionate about something in life, which to me, made him considerably more attractive than Charles!

If I were to re-write this movie, I would have an alternative ending...my alternative? Have both men be interested in Sophie , but in the end have Sophie remain with Victor the restaurateur after seeing them work through their issues and ideas of what is romantic and have them discover what truly endures in a relationship. After all, isn't part of the purpose of an engagement period to find out those things that can be or can't be worked out in a relationship? If the screenwriters had read the book carefully, they would've realized that the real-life Juliet ""secretaries"" often gave advice to bored and unhappy couples...and that advice was usually in the vein that encourages a couple to stay together and work things out rather than run around looking for an unrealistic or unattainable ideal under the guise of ""romance.""  If that sort of thing was shown between Sophie and Victor, that would've made the movie much truer to the book...

and even if they couldn't let Sophie and Victor be together, then at least they should've let Victor find a nice Italian girl who was equally as passionate about the restaurant biz and let them be together happily...""win win"" as Victor would say! I just thought it was sort of unfair he was left without anyone at all... lol

Another issue I had with this film in comparison to the book?

The film implies that somehow ONLY women visit the Juliet wall, and write letters to her. I was surprised to discover that many of the real-life letters to Juliet asking for her guidance and advice were written by boys and men! Yet this movie continues to assert that men are not romantic...especially with creating the two dimensional stereotypical British ""cynic"" Charles...who only had his Prince William good looks going for him... and the 'workaholic' American Italo-phile Victor who was passionate about everything except his fiance!

Besides, the idea that men are not romantics is a myth...as the book clearly demonstrates. Consider that Shakespeare must have been a romantic at heart if he could write Romeo and Juliet in the first place, and also one of the most romantic poets in Italian history was Dante. If he had been alive today, maybe he would've written to Juliet about his one sided crush on Beatrice? Who knows?

I hate to say it, but Letters to Juliet (the movie) in the future will be one of those movies that will not stand the test of time. It will be as memorable as the bag of potato chips I ate with yesterday's lunch!",1289088000,2,5510,4.783157894736842

I found it enjoyable, but perhaps if it hadn't been trying so hard to be a thoughtful, love conquers all tale, I would have been able to watch it without mentally rolling my eyes every five seconds.  Sophie's fiance's obsession with food borders on hilarity, and the conversations between the two (or really, conversations between any combination of characters at all) are like watching teeth being pulled -- I just didn't see any passion being put in to the actors' portrayal of the characters; they may as well just be reading from the script.  If the script was well-written this would be less of a problem, but the screenwriters are in dire need of a concept I learned in freshman English -- show, don't tell, and for goodness sakes, make use of subtlety!  I shouldn't be able to guess the entire plot of the movie based on the first 15 minutes... Five stars for the concept (the Juliet society, the Verona setting, the fiance's profession as a chef, of all things), two for execution, and you have about a 3.5 quality film.

The two lead characters who eventually fall in love (I hope I'm not giving away anything here) are winning and likeable, and the performance of Vanessa Redgrave is quite rewarding.

A city that breathes art, memory and history. This will be the location in which the power of love will undertake its glorious mission.

When a female writer (Amanda Sygfried) flies with his fiance (Garcia Bernal) tp spent their anticipated honey moon in search of an inspiring history, she will find a curiosity. There's a wall (a mythical gate of missing illusions) visited by many female tourists who, devoted and faithfully, come to send the letters to Juliet to find, recover or reencounter her love. Intrigued by this fact, she will introduce herself into this circle of ladies who respond every single letter.

So, she will find a letter hidden behind a brick a letter sent 50 years ago, and when she firmly decides to answer it she will get into without imagining it, into a modern fable; a rampant love history ornamented by that splendid background, bewitching and captivating Italian atmosphere, where the time seems to have been frozen.

This unexpected act will become to her a double happiness. Please, don't even this movie pass silently in front of you. You've got to watch this singular script, hovered and filled of humanity and radiant sentiment.

4036796,4,B002ZG988W,"Sometimes in life we really need a movie like this one...something that uplifts us from the mundane and ""realistic"" aspects of our lives.

It's a story about romance and longings.  About unrequited or interrupted love.  And about a romantic tradition in which lovers all over come to one site to leave letters for Juliet (of Romeo and Juliet).

Amanda Seyfried's character Sophie has come to Italy with her fiance, but they end up going their separate ways to separate events.  On her own, she becomes fascinated with watching women place their letters at a monument, and then seeing that one woman collects them all at the end of the day.  She follows that woman and learns of how she writes back to everyone (as Juliet).  Shortly afterwards, while helping to collect the letters, Sophie discovers a letter behind a brick that was left there 50 years ago.  She writes to that woman, and a short time later, the woman and her grandson appear.  And thus begins the real romantic quest as Sophie helps Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) search for her long lost love.

Vanessa Redgrave made the movie worthwhile, as did the quest itself.  We got to see a lot of Italian landscapes on this journey, and could vicariously enjoy the moments along the way.

At one point, I wished that Amanda Seyfried's character would burst into song...I loved her singing voice in Mama Mia.  But, of course, that was not part of this character.

4036871,2,B002ZG988W,"Amanda Seyfried seems to have the ability to imbue a role with more substance than it demands, but this doesn't really help LETTERS TO JULIET, a harmless but sparkless overly predictable romantic comedy.

Seyfried plays Sophie, an aspiring author, who is engaged to Victor, a New York chef. She does not wear a ring. That's the first hint that things are amiss in paradise. Sophie and her intended go off to Italy on a pre-wedding Honeymoon, during which he becomes engrossed in Italian cuisine and she becomes engrossed in the city of Verona and its romantic attachment to Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET. They spend no time together. She discovers that there is a kind of Wailing Wall in Verona, where heartbroken women leave messages addressed to Juliet.

By chance, she finds a 50 year old letter from Claire (Vanessa Redgrave, who, thank God, eschews politics in this film) telling the story of her lost love, Lorenzo. Sophie answers, and before long, Claire appears with her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in tow. The three set off, seeking Lorenzo.

The results are predictable all around. The difficulty with LETTERS TO JULIET is that Charlie is initially so rude and so dismissive of Sophie that their eventual attraction to each other seems an impossible outcome. Worse yet, Egan and Seyfried have ZERO chemistry onscreen (Seyfried is lovely and wide-eyed while Egan, squinty-eyed and grimacing, appears to be suffering from a digestive complaint all throughout the film). The mother-daughter affection that blooms between Claire and Sophie seems so much more sincere than the forced and faked ""love"" that Sophie and Charlie proclaim for one another.

I see them advertised at the theater, read the reviews, decide which ones I am interested in and then wait for the DVD. Sometimes, the movie does not live up to my extended expectations. Other times, my patience is richly rewarded. Last night was one of those times.

I was so excited to get to see ""Letters to Juliet""  last night. It tells the story of a wannabe writer, Sophia, who goes off to Verona on a vacation with her fiance. He's busy scoping out suppliers for his new restaurant, so she takes advantage of the time to do some sight-seeing on her own. In doing so, she comes across a group of women called the ""secretaries of Juliet"" who write back to the women who leave their letters asking for love advice at Juliet's wall. She joins them, and finds a letter written 50 years earlier (it had been stuck behind a brick). On a whim, she responds to the woman who had left her one true love behind when she was a girl. The letter finds the owner, the owner's grandson finds Sophia and the adventure to find Lorenzo (the man left behind) begins. I am a sucker for a good love story and this one certainly met the bill. It is a sweet story, rated PG, with nothing objectionable in it. It has a sense of mystery, a good sense of humor, and shows that love can come in many different ways and at different stages of life.

She visits Juliet's famous house, where for generations lovelorn women have left letters asking for advice in Juliet's brick wall. The locals who answer the letters on Juliet's behalf invite Sophie to join them and her response to a 50-year old letter will change several lives forever.

This has all the makings of a charming chick flick, telling an idealistic love story in a stunningly beautiful place. Verona and the Tuscan countryside are so gorgeous, I was ready to pack my bags and go. Seyfried makes a likable enough heroine, but she's paired with wooden Christopher Eagan who lacks depth, looks too young, and is a total cheeseball. They share absolutely no romantic sparks whatsoever.

The movie is saved by Vanessa Redgrave as the woman who wrote the letter decades ago. She's classy, confidant, and doesn't look like she's acting. Her reunited lost love is played to perfectio by Franco Nero who commands the screen even though his part is small. (Their obvious chemistry is for real; they were in love in the sixties, parted, and only recently reunited and married - good plot for a movie!)

It's a shame the story has such a Disneyish fairy tale-feel to it. One knows immediately everything that will happen and how it will end.

However it isn't five-star material for me.  *Most of the movies I watch and re-watch actually aren't.  But that does not mean they are not good movies and this movie is a good one in my book.  I personally recommend that you at least rent it, but if you are a hopeless-romantic; I suggest that you just buy it.  You'll be glad you did.
  I spent about $20.00 on the movie and for one of the first times, I wasn't upset that I'd wasted my money; unlike most of the movie's I've purchased recently.
With that said, I have to let everyone here know that I am a hopeless-romantic and I absolutely love basically everyone love story.  Some are more memorable and well worth their price tags while others I find myself questioning later on, but I'll still re-watch them...

Although I believe that Amanda could have been a little more animated (like I always find myself thinking); she did a very good job and I liked her character Sophie a great deal.  I found her (Sophie) to be refreshing, a little forward, maybe even a little off *but that may just have been Seyfried) at times, however overall the character is good and the acting is as well translated through.

Christopher Egan's character Charlie is just bitter when he first shows up.  But by the end, he's changed.  Normally thats a good thing and overall it is, but I actually think I liked him better before.  At the end, I just couldn't like him as much for some reason.  But Egan did a good job and for the better part of the movie he was my second favorite.

I absolutely loved Claire, played by Vanessa Redgrave.  I loved her from her first line and couldn't resist being happy for her by the ending - which I liked.  Redgrave did a wonderful job and that's that, her character is well worth watching even if you end up not caring for Seyfried and Egan's.

But it's the ""what if"" second-time-around romance and its  magnificently scenic Italian setting that's the real grabber here.

For years, (yes really!)  young women have been posting to the wall below ""Juliet's balcony"" in Verona  letters beseeching  Shakespeare's heroine for help with  their romantic travails. This is a fictional take on  one of them and the ""Juliet's secretary"" (yes, they exist in real life, too) who found and answered her letter...50 years later.

Vanessa Redgrave is sublime in a story that parallels her own life. Last  year I saw her sister Lynn's  one-woman show ""Rachel and Juliet"" about their mother Rachel Kempson who played Juliet in her first role at Stratford and remained fixated on the character for the rest of her life. Vanessa stars here as a widow who comes back to Verona to try to find the man  she lost the courage to run away with 50 years ago. Playing opposite her is Franco Nero, the Italian actor she fell in love when they played Guinevere and Lancelot in the movie ""Camelot,"" and then reunited with and finally married some 40 years  later in 2006.  No wonder they're so wonderfully believable in these roles.

4036931,4,B002ZG988W,"LETTERS TO JULIET is a relaxed, well made romantic comedy/drama that is a step above most other films in this genre: instead of concentrating on pretty young people's hopes for finding love it successfully changes that path to include senior citizens and the result is charming. Written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan and directed in a very calm manner by Gary Winick, this little tour of Verona, Italy provides a lovely setting for a sweet story.

Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a 'fact finder' for a New Yorker Magazine and presents story details to her boss, editor Bobby (Oliver Platt).  She longs to be a writer but is merely on her way up the ladder. She is living with Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) who loves her but is more caught up in his primary love of being a chef and opening a restaurant than in filling Sophie's needs.  The two plan a pre-marriage honeymoon to Italy to spend time together, but on arrival in Verona, Victor becomes enchanted with the wines, the cheeses, etc and drags Sophie around on his culinary investigations.  Sophie discovers the Juliet setting from the Shakespeare pay, a home said to be where Juliet lived and where women from all over the world leave letters on the wall asking Juliet's advice on love matters. The letters are collected everyday and answered by a charming group of women - the Juliet Secretaries - and when Amanda discovers a hidden 50 year old letter from a women named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) who didn't follow her heart years ago and wrote for advice, Sophie writes Claire a response. The result - Claire and her supercilious grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) arrive in Verona to see if they can find Lorenzo Bartolini, the love of Claire's life she ran away from fifty years ago. Sophie, Claire and the very reluctant and pessimistic Charlie set out to find Lorenzo, finding many men with that name but none is the Lorenzo of Claire's past.  Meanwhile Victor has all but deserted Sophie in his excitement of discovering new culinary secrets and Sophie gradually falls for Charlie.  When Claire finally finds Lorenzo (Franco Nero, husband of Vanessa Redgrave in real life) destinies change and love conquers all barriers.

The mentioned cast is excellent as are the actors who fill the roles of the secretaries and the people encountered in the Lorenzo search.  The cinematography by Marco Pontecorvo is lushly beautiful: the musical score by Andrea Guerra is basically a series of semi-popular type songs - not very additive or interesting.

4036959,4,B002ZG988W,"I went to see the movie in the theater.  Obviously, it wasn't my choice.  I saw the previews several times.  Didn't expect any surprises. Just trying to get points.

What I got was an excellent tour flick, several good romances.  Very likeable characters.  Simple enough for children to follow, yet complex enough for even the most analytical.  OK.  Some of the character evolutions were less than true to life.

But I would watch it again.  In fact, my wife insists on buying it.",1280275200,6,480,4.674698795180723
4036960,5,B002ZG988W,"I took a dear elder aged friend to this movie on a bad day in his life, hoping to distract him momentarily from events he couldn't do anything about. Instead, the movie re-invigorated both of us, and brought us repeatedly to tears. Say what you want about ""feel good"" movies, there are times when they are just what the doctor ordered!

Vanessa Redgrave is the heart of this film. The delicately fearless way she sets out to find her young lover, the grace with which she moves through the ups and downs of a process that could end in heartbreak, the care with which she brushes the young Sophie's hair...she is simply and purely lovely. Women d'un certain age should enjoy the possibilities she presents for aging beautifully.

I also suspect this movie was made after the death of Redgrave's daughter, Natasha Richardson, and so the scenes in which she calls Sophie ""my darling"" and loves her so freely are especially moving. Hollywood, listen up! Cast more Vanessa Redgraves, Judy Denschs and Helen Mirrens as stars in movies about life after 60, and you'll fill the theaters.",1279238400,187,1079,4.764705882352941

I promised her I would purchase this for her as soon as it was released on DVD. I am doing so now that we have a release date.
The movie is VERY predictable but also very ""FEEL GOOD"". As a guy you can't go wrong renting or buying this movie and watching it with the special person in your life. The acting is good, the characters believable, and there is also nothing I could find to keep the entire family from viewing it, although it probably won't be enjoyed by persons who have not reached the age of understanding the joy of true love.
Buying this DVD/BLU-RAY disk should save me hundreds in gas money, beverages, pop-corn and admission prices. I highly recommend it!!",1278720000,26,950,4.112903225806452

A couple of girlfriends and I enjoyed an afternoon in a cool theater on a hot day. The Italian countryside washed over us and that alone was worth the price of admission. Gorgeous scenery. The story is sweet as well. Romantics will love the lost letter and the search for love fifty years after it is written, and the adventures on the way. Skeptics may struggle with the moments of lightness and silliness that cross over into cheesy a time or two. I really struggled with liking either of the love interests for Sophie.

However, like I said, it was a fun outing full of gorgeous Italian countryside with enough romance to make most girls swoon, so it's definitely worth a rent.",1278720000,4,781,4.578571428571428

STARRING: Amanda Seyfried, Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Egan, Gael Garcia Bernal, Franco Nero and Oliver Platt

WRITTEN BY: Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan

DIRECTED BY: Gary Winick

Rated: PG
Genre: Romantic Comedy / Drama
Release Date: 14 May 2010
Review Date: 20 May 2010

We were in a real lull there for a while with romantic comedies, but recently there have been a few good ones. Letters to Juliet is one such film.

It's predictable at times yes, but it is fun and warm and beautiful to watch. Some very detailed cinematography capturing glorious landscapes can be found here. The actors and the story add a great deal to the film's warmth as well.

Amanda Seyfried, who I fall a little more in love with in everything I see her do, stars as Sophie. Sophie is an American who travels to Verona Italy with her boyfriend Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), who barely recognizes she is there. Victor adores her in his own way, but is far too engulfed with pursuing his dreams becoming a terrific chef. They traveled to Verona for a romantic getaway, but as fate would have it, Victor heads off to attend cooking classes, leaving Sophie alone.

Being an aspiring writer, Sophie would surely not let this trip go to waste. Her boredom takes her on a tour of the majestic countryside where she stumbles upon a discovery that will change her life forever.

She finds what has been said to be the very house that once inhabited William Shakespeare's beloved character Juliet. Sophie finds thousands of love letters that have been placed snuggly into deep crevasses in the home's outer wall. They are written by women seeking wholesome love advice from Juliet. Sophie is enthralled with this ritual and one letter in particular, captures her heart.

It was written some 50 years ago by a woman who had long since lost touch with a man she once loved so dearly. The woman is Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) and Sophie is so moved by her words, that she writes Claire a heartfelt letter of her own in return, inspiring Claire to track her lost love down.

Claire is in turn so grateful of Sophie's kind words that she comes to Verona with her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in tow. Naturally Charlie is around the same age as Sophie and is dashingly handsome. As clich as this is, I promise you that their humorous meeting and superb acting will have you more than forgiving of it.

In defense of his grandmother who has been heartbroken once or twice, Charlie is not pleased by Sophie's gesture; especially when he suspects she is only interested in seeing these two lovebirds reunite, in hopes of writing a successful story about it.

The dynamic of the relationships between these three characters works like clockwork in every scene. Against Charlie's wishes, Sophie and Claire hit it off right away, and the three are off on a journey to find Claire's Romeo. None of them counted on there being several hundred Italian men named Lorenzo Bartolini to sort through, but hey - that's half the fun.

Director Gary Winick who also brought us 13 Going on 30, has crafted another gorgeous film. He blends solid dramatic moments with dead-on comedic timing and the film is more than entertaining. It's the kind of movie that makes you either want to call up an old flame that got away if you are single, or take a trip to Italy with your significant other; either way, it inspires good times to be had.",1277337600,5,3406,4.683417085427136
4036964,4,B002ZG988W,"In ""Letters to Juliet,"" Sophie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amanda-Seyfried/dp/B0037QGS0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amanda Seyfried</a>) is a fact-checker at ""The New Yorker"" who wants to be a writer.  She is engaged to Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), a chef who is gearing up to open his own restaurant in New York City, which explains not only why they are taking their ""honeymoon"" to Verona before the wedding, but why Victor is more interested in checking out the local food and wine than on spending quality time with Sophie.  Left on her own, Sophie visits Casa di Giulietta, an old house in Verona that has a balcony and is purported to be Juliet's house (of course it is not--for one thing the ""true story"" was set in Siena--but clearly visitors are employing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Velveteen-Rabbit/dp/0312377509/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Velveteen Rabbit</a>"" logic, which I have seen played out with equal emotion at another faux site, namely&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Gables/dp/0399154787/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Gables</a>&nbsp;on Prince Edward Island).  Visitors from around the world flock there and Sophie discovers dozens of women writing letters to Juliet, which they then stick on the wall beneath the balcony.  At the end of the day a woman shows up, carefully removes the letters, and puts them in a basket.

Sophie follows the woman and discovers the Club di Giulietta, a quartet of women who volunteer to respond to the letters left to Juliet.  Intrigued by the whole idea as a possible story to jump start her literary career, Sophie is inspired when she discovers a letter left in a hole in the wall fifty years ago in which a young woman bemoans the fact that she did not keep an appointment with the man she loved.  Sophie responds to the letter and the next thing we know Charlie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Egan/dp/B0024FAD88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Egan</a>) shows up and wants to know what idiot wrote his grandmother Claire (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanessa-Redgrave/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanessa Redgrave</a>) that letter, because she has dragged him to Italy to find Lorezno Bartolini, her long lost love.

Of course, as soon as you know the basic set up you know that Sophie is going to tag along with Claire and Charlie on this romantic question, and it is fairly obvious who is going to end up with whom.  Consequently, there are not any great surprises, although when Charlie first shows up he does tend to make Victor look better, even though by that point it is clear that Sophie should ditch her fianc&eacute; because being with nobody is preferable to being with him.  That being said, there is not a lot of depth to the developing relationship between Sophie and Charlie beyond the looks in Claire's eyes that make it clear this is a consummation that she devoutly wishes.  It ends up being what I think of as a Stephen Stills romance, to wit, ""love the one you're with,"" so this 2010 film from director Gary Winnick (""Bride Wars""), is enjoyable but is not going to be one that you will watch time and time again to make yourself weep at the emotional power of love.

I first heard of ""Letters from Juliet"" when the trailer for this summer romantic comedy screened right after a trailer for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-John/dp/B0021L8V3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear John</a>.""  Apparently actress Seyfried was looking over two scripts about love stories in which letters play a pivotal role and if she flipped a coin it must have landed on its edge because she did both of them, back-to-back.  ""Dear John"" was more of a tragic romance, while ""Letters from Juliet"" would qualify more as a romantic comedy, although with the emphasis way more on the romance than on the comedy, which is rather refreshing given some of the recent films I have seen in this genre.  This is not a great romantic film, but it is certainly more enjoyable than the recent offerings I have seen (e.g., ""When in Rome,"" ""Leap Year,"" and, for that matter, ""Dear John"").

The chief charm of this film, in addition to the lush Italian countryside, is Redgrave, who provides a case study in making acting look completely effortless (and then there is the whole&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Franco-Nero/dp/6304712944/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Franco Nero</a>&nbsp;backstory).  She also gets the big romantic moment in the movie, when she gets around to reading a pivotal letter.  Seyfried is a busy young actress these days, and when I see here I always wonder who would have thought that Lindsay Lohan would turn out to be the least talented of the actresses in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls/dp/B0002IQJ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls</a>.""  I still think at this point&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-McAdams/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel McAdams</a>&nbsp;comes in first, but Seyfried comes in a close second, especially after she showed she could do more than just carry a tune in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia! The Movie</a>.""  This time around I noticed that when her face lights up and she goes for a big smile, that smile reminds me very much of Goldie Hawn's, which is just another plus in Seyfried's favor.

In case it is not clear, people really do write letters to Juliet and for seven decades women in Verona have been writing back, as volunteers of the Juliet Club.  If you are interested in the ""true story"" (or 75 ""true letters""), then check out Letters to Juliet: Celebrating Shakespeare's Greatest Heroine, the Magical City of Verona, and the Power of Love by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman.  The book is acknowledged in the end credits, although it is not a source for the screenplay by Jose Rivera (""The Motorcycle Diaries"") and Tim Sullivan (""Jack and Sarah""), but some sort of accommodation has to be made when you have the same title and the same subject.  So, yes, that really is the Casa di Giulietta, and visitors really do leave letters and rub the breast of the statue of Juliet because legend has it that brings you good luck.  Final note: When I saw this film the plan was to go out for Chinese food afterwards, but halfway through the opening scenes I was suddenly starving and it was obvious we were going to have to go out for fancy Italian food (five cheese crespelle with sausage).  I am glad we did not give in and munch on popcorn, because sometimes the unconventional order of doing a movie and dinner is justified.",1277078400,3,6991,5.685220729366603
4036965,5,B002ZG988W,"I do not cry very often in movies, But in this one, OMG! I've almost drowned in my own tears...

Predictible? Entirely. Cliches? Another big YES!But the movie is never cheesy or corky and that's the reason it conquered me completly.

The film is simply beautiful( Franco and Redgrave meeting, the wedding cerimony and Vanessa reading Amanda's letter to her during the wedding reception soaked my kleenex). Vanessa and Nero are a very sincere tribute to true love and her performance is delicate and sensitive.

The two young guys are less charming but Amanda is adorable and sweet.

I highly recommend. What a beautiful love story! There's not such like this sort nowadays..",1276560000,23,674,4.938053097345133
4036966,5,B002ZG988W,"I went to watch this film last night, mainly to see Vanessa Redgrave, and Franco Nero acting together again, having seen them in Camelot a long while ago.
I am an old romantic, hence Camelot being my favourite film of all time, but I have to say Letters to Juliet will now come a close second.
It was a pleasure to watch, The story line was a bit cute, but enjoyable nonetheless.
I found some of the scenes quite moving. I know wether I am enjoying a film as I smile all the time and thats exactly what I did.
The scenery was wonderfull, and will encourage many visitors to beautifull Verona and the wonderfull Italy.
Pleasant, romantic, sceneic, funny, what more could you ask for. Curl up with a box of chocolates.",1276560000,29,716,4.390977443609023
4037026,4,B002ZG988W,"It's amazing how movies work on people. ""Letters to Juliet"" is a contrived, mushy, predictable story of love and romance, and yet it thoroughly won me over. This is strange given the fact that I'm usually so critical of romances, especially if they're trying to be funny. But unlike the desperate comedy of films like ""My Life in Ruins,"" ""27 Dresses,"" and the newly released ""The Back-Up Plan,"" this movie keeps its humor low key, reserving it for only such moments that it's actually needed. On the same token, it doesn't go for the needlessly weepy melodrama of movies like ""Dear John"" and ""The Last Song,"" both based Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers; it's all rather sweet and charming and fun, a nice way to spend 101 minutes away from the house, especially if you're with a date.

The story begins in New York City, where Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young fact checker for ""The New Yorker,"" dreams of becoming a featured writer. She's engaged to a developing chef named Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), who seems pleasant enough but is really more interested in micromanaging the opening of a new restaurant than in spending time with his bride to be. They travel to Verona on what was supposed to be a pre-honeymoon but, for Victor, ended up becoming a scouting mission for the best wines, olive oils, and truffles. The pre-honeymoon idea is enough of a red flag, I think. Honestly, who actually goes on something called a ""pre-honeymoon""?

For Sophie, it becomes the perfect opportunity to write a story for her magazine. One day, she happens upon the house where Juliet Capulet is said to have lived and watches as emotional women from all over the world post relationship letters to a stone wall. She then becomes involved with a group of women who collect the letters and respond to them one by one. They call themselves Juliet's Secretaries, which, if you ask me, is actually a cute name. Entirely by accident, Sophie discovers a letter from 1957, written by a love-struck but frightened girl named Claire who left her beloved behind and returned home to England. Sophie is touched and decides to write back, apparently confident that, after a period of over fifty years, Claire still lives at the same address.

As it turns out, this is the case. A few days later, Sophie is approached by Claire's grandson, Charlie (Christopher Egan), a cold and bitter young man who disapproves of what Sophie has done. Because of her reply, his grandmother has returned to Verona and is on a quest to find her lost love - an utterly foolish idea if there ever was one. Undaunted, Sophie follows Charlie and meets Claire (Vanessa Redgrave), quite a bit older now but no less in the throes of romance. Kindly and gracious, she immediately takes a liking to Sophie and, despite Charlie's objections, lets her tag along on a cross-country search for her old flame, whose name is Lorenzo Barotlini. Sophie knows that Victor won't mind her going; he's too involved in food hunts and wine auctions to take notice.

If you know anything about movie romances, then chances are you have a pretty good idea of where this is going, so I don't need to describe any more of the plot. Suffice it to say, this is a wholly delightful story with appealing characters, and it's all set against the backdrop of picturesque Italian landscapes. It was an experience that, however hokey, I was glad to be a part of. I have to treasure feelings like that because, quite frankly, I don't often have them; I'm usually pointing out all the ways in which the audience is coerced, if not shamelessly manipulated, into emotional submission. But even I have a sentimental side, and I'm glad there are movie like this that allow me to indulge in it.

I was moved, for instance, by the rekindled love between Claire and Lorenzo (Franco Nero), which mirrors the real life relationship between the actors who played them. Back in 1967, Redgrave and Nero met on the set of ""Camelot"" and became romantically involved. They finally married in 2006. Considering the film's theme of officially claiming a love that had always been, can you honestly say this doesn't warm your heart just a little? Watching them together onscreen, you truly do believe that they're in love, which is more than I can say for most modern romance stories between young people who in all likelihood wouldn't know love if it came up and bit them.

""Letters to Juliet"" is by no means groundbreaking cinema, but boy, is it charming. I liked the story, rote though it may be. I cared about the characters, young and old. I appreciated the fact that, in spite of his standoffish take on Victor, Bernal didn't play him as a crude, unlovable caricature. Most of all, I enjoyed the chemistry between Seyfried, Egan, Redgrave, and Nero. I can imagine a movie like this being used in the field of neuroscience, specifically in how it affects dopamine and endorphin levels, both thought to play a part in how much pleasure a person feels. I suspect most participants would show an increase. No matter how silly they may seem, some movies just make you feel good inside.",1276128000,2,5085,4.740112994350283
4037027,3,B002ZG988W,"The Set-Up: Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a fact-checker for the New Yorker and her fianc, Victor (Gael Garca Bernal), a budding restaurateur (two jobs that, apparently, pay much more handsomely than I would have guessed), go on a ""pre-honeymoon"" to Verona, Italy. There, Victor immerses himself in meetings with wine and food vendors he hopes will become his suppliers and Sophie, left on her own, discovers a group of women who answer love letters left at the home of Shakespeare's tragic Juliet. Invited to join these women in their work, Sophie discovers a letter written some 50 years earlier and pens an answer to it, which brings the letter writer, Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) and her grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) to Verona. There, Sophie, Claire and the argumentative Charlie meet and, over Charlie's objections, decide to seek out Lorenzo Bertolini, Claire's lost love. Rather than (sensibly) making a series of phone calls, they choose to pay personal visits to each of the Lorenzo Bertolini's Sophie (using those fact-checking skills) was able to find within a certain radius of Verona. This calls for a road trip.

Before its release and in many reviews, much was made of the scenery in the film; I seem to recall one reviewer going so far as to call it a character. And I'll agree that there are certainly some stunning shots, particularly of the countryside. On the other hand, I found myself disappointed that we did not see a lot more of Verona and Siena. The glimpses we got of the cities were so wonderful that I found myself longing to see a lot more of them - and a lot less of the interior of the car.

Letters to Juliet is utterly predictable. I honestly felt like I could have outlined nearly every scene just from seeing the trailer, and a good chunk of the dialogue, too. I will say, though, that the predictability wasn't excruciatingly annoying and, at the film's end, I didn't leave the theater feeling like I had just wasted two precious hours of my life. Hence the ""mostly harmless"" in my review title.

While I could argue that I actually found the vibrantly-portrayed Victor (the fianc whose passion for food and cooking made it possible for us to like him even though he was cluelessly neglectful of his bride to be), the most interesting character in Letters to Juliet, the film is most definitely Redgrave's. Claire's search for her Lorenzo is poignant and the enduring passion between them is handled with sweetness and a lovely delicacy. Her search also provided what were, for me, the two best things in the film: humor as each new Lorenzo was found and checked off the list and some genuine suspense as I waited for Franco Nero to finally make an appearance so that I could see how well the actor had aged. (The spoilery answer? Very well, indeed.)

My final verdict? Mildly diverting, but not a film I will long remember nor one I would watch again. Even, you know, for Franco.",1275782400,2,2918,4.7495069033530575
4037028,2,B002ZG988W,"The one strength of this movie is the beautiful scenery of Italy. It is typical Hollywood product - the four and five star movies are few and far between.

Nearly everything that happens in this movie is entirely predictable. The dialogue is painfully poor - I actually felt sympathy for the actors at several points during this movie for having to follow the script.  Vanessa Redgrave deserves better parts than this.

In addition to these serious flaws, I was bothered by the main character's ""issue"" with her fiance. For her to be disappointed that he didn't want to do most of their activities together on this trip was understandable. But the viewer gets the impression that she wanted him to focus ONLY on her during this trip - a very childish and egocentric view of ""true love.""

The friend I saw it with brought her 9 year old daughter and I saw no reason why the movie was rated PG. The 9 year old really liked it.",1275264000,8,924,4.514970059880239
4037029,4,B002ZG988W,"I went to this picture with my mom because I enjoy romantic films and adore Italian landscape. I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was absolutely charming, and I didn't come away with that ""why did they have to put that in there"" feeling.  A true ""feel good"" movie. So many films go along nicely then suddenly BAM! an unexpected horribly sad plot twist. This gets worse than old at times. I'm a big Austen fan, and although she wrote with unexpected plot twists she always ends with a happy, if predictable, ending. And how do ""her"" film adaptations do?! Awesome!  Let's hope hollywood learns something here. I hated to see the film end, and could have turned right around and watched it again. Way to Go! Some great young stars shine in this film. Hope to see them around again.",1275264000,89,780,4.564285714285714
4037030,4,B002ZG988W,"The romantic comedy is a staple of the multi-plex. Studios consistently trot out formulaic offerings pairing two attractive people in a story little better than your average television show. A number of recent examples have used old-fashioned romantic comedies as their 'inspiration'. ""When in Rome"" seems to be modeled after the old Doris Day and Rock Hudson films. Nothing in the film could ever happen in reality and the actors seem to keep winking at the camera. Unfortunately, they seem to be the only ones in on the joke. In ""The Bounty Hunter"", Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler spend the entire film fighting with one another, often inflicting physical pain on one another. In the end, they get together (I'm sure that was a big surprise) but you won't care because the rest of the film is so unpleasant. In ""The Back-Up Plan"", animated, very retro style opening credits clue us in to indicate the inspiration for the film would be any lighthearted romance from the 60s. Unfortunately, the film contains many lengthy sequences, which seem to be funny only to the cast and crew involved. And the filmmakers seem insistent on making Jennifer Lopez appear Caucasian. A very strange film.

So it is a surprise to find ""Letters from Juliet"", a sweet, romantic, fun to watch and slightly formulaic film starring Amanda Seyfried (HBO's ""Big Love"", ""Mamma Mia""), Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Egan (lots of TV work) and Gael Garcia Bernal.

Sophie (Seyfried), a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, dreams of becoming a writer. She and her fianc&eacute;, Victor (Bernal), a restaurateur, travel to Verona for a pre-marriage Honeymoon, Victor's restaurant opens in a few weeks, so they want to get away before the wedding. In Verona, Victor quickly starts to get engrossed in local wineries, cheese makers, and butchers, anything that might help his new restaurant. Sophie was hoping the trip would be something more romantic. One day, she wanders to Juliet's wall late in the afternoon. As she sits composing a letter, she watches a woman gather all of the letters and follows her back to a small room above a restaurant. There, she meets a group of women who are known as ""Juliette's secretaries"". They answer every letter, trying to provide some hope to the lovelorn ladies who feel it necessary to write Juliet discussing their love problems. Sophie becomes intrigued and starts to ask questions. The next day, she finds a letter hidden in the wall for fifty years. She decides to write back to Claire, a British woman seeking advice about her affair with an Italian lover. A few days later, Charlie (Egan), Claire's grandson shows up and wants to know who wrote the letter. Charlie is not a romantic and doesn't appreciate the intrusion. Sophie learns he has accompanied his grandmother, Claire (Redgrave) and wants to meet her. Before you can say ""Shakespeare"", Sophie is accompanying them as they crisscross Tuscany trying to find Claire's long lost lover.

Seyfried is good as Sophie. She is cute but somehow doesn't seem overly beautiful which helps her seem a little more realistic and interesting. She also makes Sophie more intelligent than most of the characters in these films. Perhaps because she already has a fianc&eacute;e, she isn't looking for love and when she finds it, it seems more natural. As she realizes Victor is more interested in visiting cheese merchants and wine auctions, she shows her disappointment in a subtle way. She wants to express her feelings, but she can see how excited Victor is about these things, so she lets him have his fun. She gives us the feeling this is what she believes a new bride should do, make a certain number of sacrifices. And then she finds out about Juliet's Secretaries and meets Claire and her grandson and finds both a subject for a story she can write for the New Yorker and an adventure to fill her time in Italy.

During the road trip, she and Charlie spend a lot of time together and get to know one another better. At times, this is both a blessing and curse for both as Charlie finds himself attracted to Sophie and Sophie occasionally learns more about Charlie, making her even less interested in him. But of course, they also begin to see each other as they truly are, as they let their defenses down and begin to talk. This seems to draw them together.

Christopher Egan is good as Charlie. He is probably the most stereotypical of the three characters and he has the least wiggle room to bring anything new and exciting to the character. But he controls the character, showing his traits in subtle and believable ways. We quickly learn Charlie is not a romantic and finds the entire trip frustrating beyond belief. This makes Sophie dislike him, because she is completely the opposite and can't understand Charlie's skepticism. But as they spend time together, Sophie learns a little about Charlie, allowing us a glimpse into the young man's life, which in turn makes him more empathetic.

The real selling point for this film is Vanessa Redgrave. Her presence simply makes the film more believable and interesting. From the moment she first appears on screen as Claire, you get her. She looks at Sophie with hopeful, yet tired eyes. She is, after all, looking for her long lost love from fifty years ago. As she makes this journey, we get the sense she is waking up, finding renewed meaning to her life. But because she has gone through so much of her life, she is a bit weary and a bit tired. Even though she is hopeful, she is prepared for the worse. Somehow, this makes our emotions more in tune with hers. We feel her emotions more. She also knows her grandson too well and is able to make a quick comment putting him in his place as necessary.

There are a few scenes with Redgrave, which simply make the rest of the film work. In one, she talks with Sophie about her husband, Charlie's grandfather. At the beginning of the journey, Charlie seems more annoyed because his grandmother is looking for ""the love of her life"" and can't understand why that person isn't his grandfather. ""Let's not totally negate my existence"", he asks. Claire and Sophie share a conversation giving us the back-story of this moment. In another, Claire seems to be losing hope but Sophie urges her on, making her believe they will indeed find her long lost love. Redgrave makes this moment work through her reactions to Sophie.

Gael Garcia Bernal plays Victor, an aspiring restaurateur. He is actually cartoonish and dense throughout. Victor is very excited about his restaurant and quickly becomes overwhelmed by the possibilities when they arrive in Verona. His connection sets up meetings with winemakers, cheese makers, butchers and more. And Victor jumps in feet first. But Sophie isn't interested and starts to sightsee on her own. Victor is a stupid man, bringing his fianc&eacute;e to a country on the pretext of a romantic trip and essentially abandoning her for visits to possible food vendors, touring their caves and fields. The fact he seems so oblivious makes him a bit of an idiot and not very believable.

Some moments work really hard to stretch the credibility of everything else. When Sophie writes the answer to Claire, they mail it on the third (?) night of her stay. In the next scene, Charlie shows up with his grandmother and Sophie is still in Verona. Huh? There is no way a letter would make it from Verona to the English Countryside in less than a week. Then, Claire and Charlie have to make the travel arrangements and actually travel to Italy. Sophie is either on the longest vacation in history or we are supposed to believe the letter arrives in one day. A small quibble, because this is a romantic drama and comedy and we have to suspend a certain amount of belief and go with it. The filmmakers need Sophie and Charlie to meet, so we have to take this jump and move on.

""Letters to Juliet"" provides a nice homage to the romantic films of the 50s and 60s and gets most of the moments right. Because it gets it right, we enjoy the ride and believe in the budding romance.

""Letters to Juliet"" is a welcome surprise.",1274745600,2,8114,4.763869132290185
4037031,4,B002ZG988W,"Redgrave (Claire) first met her present husband Nero (Lorenzo) in the late sixties during the filming of CAMELOT. For those who'd followed Redgrave's legendary acting career and her filmography, this is a real treat of celebration of life and its worthiness for reunion of two hearts believing in true love.",1274486400,,307,5.16
4037032,5,B002ZG988W,"Quite honestly, I didn't really plan to go see this movie. Although I really enjoy Amanda Seyfried, when I saw the previews for this movie, it looked a bit too much like a schmaltzy romance, a kind of celluloid goo that doesn't resonate five minutes after leaving the theater. However, wiser heads (and my partner) prevailed, and I found myself almost enchanted over the next two hours at this delightful, quiet, powerful type of romance film that truly has appeal.

Ms. Seyfried finds herself once again playing another Sophie (first one in Mamma Mia!), who once again is engaged (this time to a distractable fiance played by the lovable Gael Garcia Bernal). This Sophie doesn't sing, but writes. No, she doesn't write either, but merely is a fact checker for the New Yorker magazine, but yearns to write. Due to scheduling conflicts, she and her fiance Victor fly to Verona, seemingly to have an early honeymoon, but in reality, Victor wants to dialogue business the entire trip. This leaves Sophie to find the venerable ""Juliet wall"", where hoards of heartbroken women leave love notes to Juliet attached to a wall, hoping she will help them with their crisis (remind me never to fall in love in Verona!).

Seeing a woman pluck the notes from the wall, Sophie discovers a small group of women who answer these lovelorn letters (at least the ones with addresses). Sophie quickly joins the group and finds a letter one day, fifty years in the making. It was written by a young English woman who, due to circumstance, could not marry the Italian boy she loved. Sophie writes back, and invites the amazing Vanessa Redgrave into the movie, playing lovelorn Claire, and her mildly cartoony and thickly irritating grandson Charlie with her.

Predictable? Entirely. You know exactly where the movie is headed ten minutes into it, and the director of the movie Gary Winick, seems to not realize it by giving us a few unnecessary scenes towards the end that could have easily been cut or shortened. However, what makes this movie five stars is the character of Claire. Her story is handled so gently, with kid gloves, a small dash of humor, and most importantly, with respect. Redgrave glows on the screen in every scene she's in, and you get the sense that the trip is more for her grandson that it ever is for her.

It's not often that movies nowadays treats romance of our senior set with any respect or admiration. Sometimes, they are accorded two scenes, while the focus of the movie lands on the young twenty-nothings to carry the plot (and plop popcorn buying teens into the seats). So Claire's story is a wonderfully invigorating breath of fresh air into what could have been a stale movie. Her search is a search for love eternal, and one that the audience goes along with her, with bated breath, waiting to see if she finds her lost love, and cheering her every step of the way.",1274313600,15,2881,4.721669980119285
4037033,5,B002ZG988W,"Ah! Verona, beautiful actresses, handsome men, romance, Italian vino, Mama Mia food, and with Vanessa Redgrave (as Claire) a film topper like whipped creme on top tierra-masu. Short of 5 stars only because of predictability. But we romantics want our classic love stories to end happily ever after. That's why they are classified as romantic rather than relationship-horror.

Here a granny seeks a lost soul-mate while young lovers struggle. maybe the relationship between Claire and Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is the best love story of them all in this film. You can't fault the Italian setting, picturesque streets, classic Italian interiors, charming costumes, and even the subtitles which assist with the fast pace Italian accent dialogue.

Special Features: deleted & extended scenes; Making of...; A Courtyard in Verona; & audio commentary boost this DVD to a full 5 stars after it's 4-star theater film run. I saw it on the big screen--then bought the DVD on release day. And it's 'Dove' family approved.

Relax, sit back beside a spouse or a significant other, have a tray of cheeses, a baguette, and of course sparkling grape juice (or the real thing); then enjoy the romance, provided by ""Letters to Juliet"" and company. good for any age viewer, teens to even seniors--ageless romantics. I just had to give my wife a kiss when the credits began to roll. It's that kind of DVD. You may watch it often.",1274054400,,1408,4.982978723404256
4037034,3,B002ZG988W,"Gary Winick's 2010 film ""Letters to Juliet"" contains all the right ingredients to make a fabulously lighthearted romantic comedy that should teach every lover's torch to burn bright.  However, the overall combination of beautiful young stars, older, dignified stage and film veterans, captivating scenery and Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers does nothing synergistically other than create a rather bland just-under two hour fare.

The problem has nothing to do with the storyline; the overall premise here sugars the heart like the perfect icing on a moist cupcake.  Sophie, (the wide-eyed and silken haired Amanda Seyfried--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dear-John/dp/B0021L8V3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dear John</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia-The-Movie-Widescreen/dp/B001GKJ2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!

Purveyor opportunities send the passionate Vincent on gourmand fare finding missions that take him away from his beloved and catapult her into Capulet territory--literally showing her another brick in the wall of the Casa di Guilietta.  In this case, the wall wails a bit with letters of the lovelorn from a variety of countries collected each day by a quartet of Italian Dear Abbys that act as Juliet's secretaries, dutifully answering the pleas scribbled from present day petitioners of Shakespeare's most famous maiden.  When Sophie finds an undiscovered note written by Englishwoman Claire bemoaning her decision to leave her lover Lorenzo some fifty years prior, she feels compelled to respond, setting an entire chain of events in motion that may motivate her to write an entertaining feature story but threatens her upcoming nuptials.  Enter stage left, the softly aging Claire (the one and only Vanessa Regrave) appears, prompted by Juliet's long awaited response; she comes to seek her man.  Cynical Charlie (Christopher Egan), the handsome blonde grandson scowls attractively and, of course, cannot help but hate to love the ever-romantic Sophie.  Let me reiterate: As the plot has potential, the golden cypress-speared scenes of the Crete Senesi area of Tuscany lull with their stark photographic beauty and the actors exude sex appeal and enough sad-eyed empathy to play without dialogue, why does this film seem like a wasted 105 minutes?

Perhaps `wasted' is too harsh a term. The film attempts to be a pretty confection.  Nonetheless with all these marvelous ingredients, why doesn't ""Letters to Juliet"" play like a modern day Shakespearean sonnet that honors love both old and young?

I think the fault lies mainly in this film's editing.  Perhaps to keep the film under two hours, Bill Pankow went digital scissor happy.  Somehow the character of Charlie transferred from the Sophie hating camp to the Sophie loving camp in crucial moments not seen on the screen.  These pre-loving/lusting moments are shown in montage fashion akin to a music video wonder depicting more Tuscan beauty and unheard dialogue between the two leads that the audience needs to hear rather than imagine.  Seyfried pouts and tears up prettily, but as in her performance in Dear John, she doesn't seem to have the range to portray a more mature character.  Egan charms with a Prince Edward polish, yet the dialogue extended to him could have been more developed, less clipped and much more believable if written to enhance his obvious selling points. As a couple, the duo does have chemistry, but the script is hard put to utilize its foundations to the fullest extent.  Not enough scenes providing more emotional disclosure limits both actors.

Case in point:  both characters suffer from the loss of mothers--why not a flashback so the audience can absorb the emotional impact of this?  We understand that Sophie and her boyfriend care but do not share a passion for each other's work.  An over abundance of this interplay between Seyfried and Bernal certainly exist.  However, the same scene building is not afforded to the bond between the two eventual lovers.  Unfortunately, Redgrave's role resigns her to little significant dialogue.  As the lovesick grandma, she speaks with her eyes while she searches convincingly for the eyes of her Lorenzo.

In such a film, the positive aspects of life are sure to take a warm ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" glow that at times seems more like a travelogue than an adjunct to a scene.  In ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Tuscan-Sun-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0000VD038/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Tuscan Sun (Full Screen Edition)</a>"" Diane Lane and her fellow players exuberantly compliment the loveliness of the scenery and even though there are many moments in Audrey Wells 2003 film that are downright corny and predictable, it somehow works for that particular genre of a film that doubles as two hours worth of tourist marketing.  Who wouldn't want to go Italy and hook up with the likes of Franco Nero, his son and grandson or Raoul Bova? A veritable smorgasbord of men for women of any age.

Bottom line?  ""Letters to Juliet"" is meant to display the landscape of Tuscany and the city of Verona in Venito though the golden filter of love both young and old.  Unfortunately, due to a script that eliminates critical bonding between the two lead characters, the film lacks the warmth that one has come to expect from romantic comedy. Predictability doesn't even come into play here.  Everything looks wonderful--both the cast and locales--but a lack of engagement between the audience and the film's characters makes this reviewer wish she had more to smile and laugh about while remembering this film.  Vanessa Redgrave's quiet performance is recommended.
