8218634,5,B000VHUCD2,"I have been friends with the tibetan photo project almost since their start on facebook. they are incredible devoted people bringing the true reality of life in India and Tibet to the world through their videos.
  India is a beautiful and sometimes intimidating wild world, where children claim that they must support their familes by gaining food for street antics, and cute smiles, once they grow older no one is interested in them, and the families go without food!
  they also have incredible videos of the material industry in india, where some of the worlds finest materials are made., and beautful videos of the peaks of tibet.
  my favorite are the glimpses of the sadhu's some of indias oddities, wise men who sometimes find enlightenment by standing on one foot for years, most of the day!!
  please support the tibetan photos porject, find them on facebook, and youtube, help support them, and the work they do with donations, and by watching and sharing their videos with all your friends.
  thankyou, namaste, jill nerkowski",1318896000,2,1037,4.942196531791907
