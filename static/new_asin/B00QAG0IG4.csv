8690979,4,B00QAG0IG4,"Reminiscent of the BQ movies of the 80's but better. If you can look past the low budget quality level you'll see that the lead character goes on a quest that she's trained for all her life and learns that everything her tribe believes in and has taught her is either completely wrong or a complete lie. She loses an innocent sister to the bad guys, gains a sister-in-battle, then loses that sister to silly spiritual beliefs and ancient customs. Such depth is usually not seen in movies of this type. Would somebody please give Cecily Fay a big studio budget please? I'd like to see what she can do with a sequel. Note to Cecily: you don't need to shake the camera during fight scenes. Camera shaking is a cheap Hollywood cliche' trick employed to hide the fact that the performers have no fighting skill. Your awesome skills stand on their own, and we can't see them when you shake the camera. Take a hint from Bruce Lee, hold the camera steady (or more steady than currently) so the audience can appreciate your artwork. And in today's prudish world, thank you for being courageous enough to allow nudity in your movie, I detest priggishness, it ruins the mood and the moment.",1473811200,,1179,4.566037735849057
