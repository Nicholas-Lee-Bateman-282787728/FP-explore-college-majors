I grew up with this show, FUNimation needs to quit pretending that this show isn't 25 years old. Sadly, there is NO way to watch the episodes contained on these discs in their original aspect ratio unless you shell out hundreds for the Dragon Box. Don't buy this and hopefully FUNi will get the message.",1388534400,15,407,4.746478873239437
6105995,1,B00GS4B7GS,It's one thing to adjust the color and use DNR to clean up the picture. It's another thing to crop the image and call it uncut. Most every wide screen TV out these days has a zoom function. This means that I can turn full screen to wide screen with the push of a button! Make everybody happy and stop BSing us. The level sets were great but over priced for how many episodes they had. Give us our uncut DBZ on Bluray!!!,1388534400,10,419,4.0602409638554215
6105996,5,B00GS4B7GS,"Biggest disappointment ever was when I got the first DBZ/Kai release.  My anticipation was high when I fired it up, was ready to ROCK!  Then.....  4x3?  Are you joking?  I spent probably 10 hours trying to get it to expand, but no go.  Then after a week the blogs catch up and inform me its hard coded, deal with it.  I dealt with it, by reselling it back to wherever I got it.  Since everyone here is stating their opinion, I'm stating mine - 4x3 is retarded, hated every second of it.  Ive been waiting and finally the day is near, what I've wanting from the beginning, widescreen.  And like a few previous posters have stated:  if you don't like it, ignore it, go buy other releases;  there are several to choose from.  This one is for us who want full screen, deal with it.

6105997,1,B00GS4B7GS,"This show is supposed to be in 4:3 aspect, not cut the top and bottom of the image off and force it into widescreen aspect by taking away the tops and bottoms of the video. We want the full video, not cropped off video.

Picture in this set like in the orange sets probably looks great, but the fact that you cut the top and bottom of the video off making their hair, heads, arms, and other stuff disappear out of the image in lots of scenes is stupid to me. Its the only reason I didn't waste my money on the orange sets and I refuse to get this set too because of 16:9 cropped image.

16:9 aspect is okay when it was meant to be in that aspect, its not okay when its supposed to be 4:3 aspect and you cut the tops and bottoms of the video off and force it to be 16:9 aspect.

Great video quality like in the orange sets with 4:3 aspect and not cut off video image forced into 16:9 aspect would be pretty much the ultimate release to me and alot of the other fans out there.",1387238400,10,975,3.9642857142857144

who to blame not funimation,Funimation did a polled survey they listened to there costumes and the survey I have a few things to said first I feel funimation have so many dbz products.

6106000,5,B00GS4B7GS,"It might be a problem for some, but im sick of hearing about this ratio issue. The 4x3 versions were attempted about two years ago, and people couldn't like them as much as they claim because  no one bought them. Back when we had 4x3 tvs 99% of every movie was cropped to fit the screen, its just the way it was. Now that tvs are fit for movies instead of television shows you are going to see the same tthing reversed.
Its not a perfect world, somethings just have to give. In this case its just a lil off the top or bottom....trust me, your not missing much. People with big screen tvs would much rather have there screen filled rather then have two big black bars going up and down each side of the screen, including me!
They even had a poll to see if people would rather the 4x3 version, people voted 16x9 .
The complainers had there chance to put there money were there mouth was and  buy the level sets, they did not...now there trying to rain on my parade... ignore there reviews and don't let them stop you from enjoying this series on beautiful bluray.",1386633600,29,1061,4.27363184079602

Personally, I think you're making a mountain out of a mole-hill.  I love DBZ with all my heart, and yes, while I see your point.  It doesn't bother me.  It's only a little bit off the top and bottom.  You still see about 90% of the picture.  If you don't like it, just don't buy it.  That is your choice, but don't sway possible future DBZ fan's who don't look past the one star on these reviews. Isn't it the idea to help spread DBZ to current and future fans, and not to drive them away?  Again, you're entitled to your opinion, as am I... But your words can steer people away.  I don't think we want that.  What are going to do if they make new episodes or movies and they are 16:9 naturally?  Again. I think it's not that big of a deal, and you shouldn't either.  Make the best out of a ""bad situation"", that's my motto.",1385856000,43,1077,4.154589371980676
6106002,1,B00GS4B7GS,"If 1.33:1 (or 4:3 Aspect Ratio) (or NOT WIDESCREEN) is good enough for one of the most famous television series out there for nerds, then why isn't DBZ?

Star Trek&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Next-Generation-Season-One-Blu-ray/dp/B0083TUEHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season One [Blu-ray</a>]

Add to that most TV shows from the 90's and earlier
Famous Anime like Trigun
Famous movies, Oscar winning movies, etc.

Television shows and movies aren't cropped like the ones I mentioned above because it removes 15-20% of the show, like with this DBZ release. You're paying money to watch something that has it's content cropped. It's like buying food and getting half of what you ordered.

So why does Funimation keep releasing incomplete, and/or cropped DBZ episodes?

Probably greed. I'll describe why I think that's the case.

This series has been edited from how it is supposed to appear. Funimation has removed 15-20% of the image in each frame, or, in simple terms, the entire set of episodes is missing around 15% of the show.

They try and claim the ""pan and scan"" technology somehow improves this. It's bogus. They wouldn't need this ""pan and scan"" technology if they didn't crop the images of each frame. Why use technology, act like it's some amazing improvement in film, when you are placing a bandaid on a wound YOU caused.

There is NO legitimate reason for Funimation to crop the image, and to then use technology to try and undo the damage THEY CAUSED when they cropped the image because they could simply UNDO the cropping they caused.

This is why them and greed makes sense.

Funimation wants to keep releasing DBZ in different formats to make more money. They won't release a set of the series that has what people want because then people won't be as likely, (or so they think), to buy a set they release later that makes changes.

The Orange ""Brick"" DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z-Season-One-Vegeta-Saga/dp/B000KWZ1TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Z: Season One (Vegeta Saga)</a>&nbsp;had cropping, however, it had American Voice Actors, American Music, Japanese Voice Actors and Japanese Music. It had much of what people wanted. This is what Funimation does, they release incomplete versions of DBZ, (in this case it is cropped, and some don't like the remastering) so they can sell a different version missing something else.

The Dragon Boxes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z-Dragon-Box-One/dp/B002KPINF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box One</a>, from Japan, had NO cropping, the images weren't altered, it had American Voice, Japanese Voice, and Japanese Music.

It didn't have the American Music Soundtrack, something that MANY OF US want. Again, an incomplete version of the television show.

Then they release random collector sets, ROCK THE DRAGON,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z-Rock-the-Dragon-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00D7TS972/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Z: Rock the Dragon Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;and then something people call ""Level Sets""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z-Level-1-1-Blu-ray/dp/B005E2YL4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball  Z - Level 1.1 [Blu-ray</a>] which where blu-ray transfers of what the fans wanted, the problem is Funimation was charging 30 bucks for 20 episodes, and the Blu-ray transfer they used cost too much money, so they cancelled it.

Why Funimation won't release a simple DVD set that takes the American Music from the ""Orange Bricks"" and the not-cropped video quality of the ""Dragon Boxes"" is something I think is greed. If it isn't greed, then what is it? They have it, right now, in their studios, the material, the videos, the music, it's there. They could throw together a DVD set with those things, and they wont.

This also makes me think of them and greed.

Funimation wants to market this to people who react to buzzwords like ""HD"", ""1080p"" and ""Widescreen"" and to not get sued for false advertising for using those buzzwords, they need to remove 15-20% of the show.

The Television shows I've mentioned and many Oscar-winning movies didn't need to crop the image, or use buzzwords to get people to buy them.

If Funimation actually tried to sell the product as it should be, people who wanted widescreen could simply press a button the their remote and the TV can make it Widescreen.

More than that, when Funimation had the survey on 4:3 vs 16:9, the picture they showed for comparison made it seem like Widescreen wasn't a problem, that it didn't reduce the image much.

Why didn't Funimation show some of the images where fight scenes have half of peoples faces missing and their legs are missing also? Because Funimation either had someone who didn't know how to make a unbiased survey, or they were cropping this show regardless of the survey results.

That survey was biased.

For those of you who actually think removing 15% or so of the image is okay, would you be okay if when you go to a movie theater someone tapes blocks of wood across the top and bottom of the theater projection screen?

How about sitting behind someone who is tall?

Yeah, most people get mad when they can't see the movie they paid money to see, so for those who say this isn't a problem, I guess you wouldn't mind me removing 15-20% of the image from the movies you see.

So when some of you go to the theatre, to see a movie like World War Z, I guess you wouldn't care if I blocked the image, because as many of you say in these comments, 'it doesn't matter'.

So it's okay if I stand there with some cardboard and block off your view of the movie. It's not a problem, right? I mean, who cares about 15-20% of the image, right? And then I could go to your house, so when you rent and/or buy the movie I'll break the top and bottom part of your TV so you can't see the image there.

Still okay with it? Of course not. You would NOT want me to do that, or anyone to do that, you don't want your movies and television shows to have their content altered, you don't want this stuff edited.

Neither do I.

I'm not asking Funimation to make a DVD set that loses them money, most of us aren't. They have the materials to make what we want, and they won't.

We aren't being fanboys because in the same way you'd be made if I blocked the Theater Screen with blocks of wood, we are mad this show is being cropped. This isn't us being DBZ fanboys because if some of our favorite movies were cropped this way we'd be reacting the same way, and I think most of you would also.

The cropping of this show is almost literally no different than blocking off what you see in a theater or a movie you own. Cropping is cropping, you can crop digitially or simply block off parts of the screen, it's still cropping, and if you claim this cropping isn't a problem then you need to admit you have no problem with 15% or so of the movies you watch in theaters and on TV being cropped too.

Because, like people keep saying, 'It doesn't matter'.",1385596800,30,7254,5.187660668380463

6106028,4,B00GS4B7GS,"These Season sets are a major improvement, a blast to watch, and easily worth the price. I've watched through three of these sets now and haven't encountered any disc errors so it's all good. LIke the previous set here you get the entire Namek/Ginyu saga with the redubbed audio from the previous DVD season sets, but with a cleaned up picture and better recropping. You've got three audio tracks, the English dub with the Japanese music, the English voices with US broadcast music, and the original Japanese. Marathon mode is in tact as well.

The only extra in the previous season set was the US trailer and some textless Intro stuff. This time around we get some interviews with the english cast, in particular Christopher Sabat (Vegeta/Piccolo) and Sean Schemmel (Goku/King Kai). The interviews are spliced randomly with footage of interviews with fans and footage from some convention. It seems a bit disruptive to be listening to Chris or Sean telling a story then to be bombarded with random fans talking about how much they like the series. Also it seems like the interviews go out of their way not to talk about the early Ocean dub for some reason, framing it like Funi's dub was the original and that there was no work on the series prior, but that may have also been because perhaps neither Sean nor Chris may have worked for the company before the in-house dub.

We also get another trailer for this set but this one is about ten seconds long. I wish they would at least package the old trailers in these sets just to give us something else to watch. I guess maybe some of the trailers are owned by Cartoon Network/Toonami because they aired there but it would be nice to have some decent extras since otherwise this set is a straight up repackage. What we got is better than nothing but it feels a little underwhelming.

As far as the show itself it is the same as the previous season sets. You get the redub right up until it catches up with their original dubbing. You can clearly tell where the dubbing ends because of the sharp drop in quality. The early dubbing by Funimation was pretty aweful and it shows here. Luckily like the previous sets some of the old audio has been redubbed to make it more consistent. Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan are entirely redubbed along with Freiza and Captain Ginyu. I wish they had Sean redub Goku because his early stuff was pretty aweful and some of his dialog was super cheesy.

A big upgrade from the DVD sets is the cleaner transfer, the better crop, and the lack of the 'missing lines' flaw from those prints. This is DBZ at it's most complete and best looking presentation with a consistent English dub and all uncut. And for the price, it's a very good deal.",1496188800,,2716,4.570841889117043

Let me explain it to you so you can understand now imagine star trek being released on blu ray and fans complaining and  whining ""why is this fullscreen why isn't this widescreen ?"" Huh that's because when star trek was made for tv they weren't no widescreen TV's but we can make it widescreen if you want but we have to cut everyone's heads off ! is that ok with you ? And the true fans and purist would have said heck no  ! but a lot of dbz fans are ignorant unlike star trek fans and buy this garbage and that's why funimation cancelled the dbz levels blurays release cuz they were fullscreen

6106094,4,B00GS4B7GS,"To start off, I've been a DBZ fan since for nearly 2 decades, I've owned the 3-episode VHS releases, and I've owned DVDs, I wasn't fortunate enough to get the dragon box sets before they became ludicrously expensive, so for the longest time the only readily available AND affordable way to own the show were the Orange Bricks.

The level sets were odd to me, they seemed fragmented and I still don't understand why they couldn't simply title them Season 1, Season 2 etc. Whatever the case may be we have those aptly titled season sets on blu ray now, and as far as raw video quality, it's true that the series has never looked better, they really have done some good work here in terms of cleaning up the original frames.

I'm definitely a purist in terms of wanting the shows to look and sound as they were meant to, but it's no secret that DBZ animation is quite old and can definitely look the part, so to be honest I'm ok with these ""re-masters"", because they give me a fresh new perspective on the series as a whole. About the cropping that so many fans are up-in-arms over: it's really not as bad as the aggregious orange box cropping, they've essentially pan/scanned up, down, left, and right to ensure that no important parts of the image are being cropped out this time around, which I along with many other fans definitely appreciate. So...long story short, the video would get an 8/10 for me, they've done good work, but they should've left it un cropped, I've yet to see a modern TV since 2006 that can't achieve the same effect with digital zoom.

And that brings us to audio. As far as the English dubs...well they're the English dubs, I of course have good memories of the ocean dub growing up but it's no surprise that good old funimation wants to make sure we only hear their new DOLBY TRUEHD 5.1 PRESENTATION. They practically shove the audio selection in your face as it is always default. However, at the very least it does feature original series music director Shunsuke Kikuchi's background music, instead of the Faulconer tracks. Within the English dub the acting is quite hit or miss, all nostalgia aside. Especially in fight sequences, where the language seems to have been heavily modified to accommodate children. Ex: Vegeta saying ""Let's go...UGLY!"" And of course it's plainly obvious that we hear Christopher Sabat speaking to himself during this same scene as he voiced practically everyone in this season. This is a blu Ray release for people to own and watch at home, I do not want a dumbed down, less mature experience simply because funimation felt like I should. Even though the original Japanese version is in mono, the acting is definitely superb and the magical, amazing HD audio that funimation fronts will have you cringing in your seat multiple times over.

The bottom line is these sets are now another very affordable way to own the entire series, it's a good idea for people to get them in their collections before they become rare and out of print when funimation inevitably releases a completely uncropped Blu Ray release later on. It seems to be their market strategy to continually release DBZ sets that are ""close"", to perfect but never quite make the mark, so that 2-3 years later they can announce another set which fixes some old problems and creates new ones, thus the never-ending cycle of purchasing and profits for good old Funi.

Audio gets an 8/10 as well.",1458259200,,3414,4.664451827242525

No grain ( Unlike dragon boxes which I heard from reviews )

For the rest of us this is pretty much what we've always wanted: Dragonball Z in HD!  Loved the show growing up and I was on a nostalgia trip as I rewatched the season that got me hooked in the first place, the Namek Saga.  The animation is much cleaner than I remember and the audio options are much appreciated.  If I have one complaint it's that Funimation didn't include the ""Rock the Dragon"" intro from the dub, always got me pumped before each episode!

6106206,5,B00GS4B7GS,"I have already reviewed Season One, so I'll write this again here (with added content):

This has to be the best release of Dragonball Z that has ever been released. The video is so crisp and clear. Sure the picture is cropped, but not as much as the Orange Bricks were. Plus, to be perfectly honest it really doesn't take anything away from the picture or overall quality of the presentation. Most of the distracting film grain and scratches have been removed. The colors are much more crisp and vibrant as ever. And the video fills the entire HDTV screen (unlike the Kai releases which had black bars on the sides of the TV) without stretching the picture.

The audio is nothing short of astounding. It will sound great on your home theater system or on stereoscopic headphones. Bruce Faulconer's score (starting with episode 68 onward) is still present, but this time it has been remastered and stands large and in charge. It really rounds out the audio with a flourish only Mr. Faulconer could provide.

The extras on this disk are a little different here than on previous DVD releases. Though not as expansive as you'd find on some Blu Ray and DVD releases of theatrical movies, this set does include 3 featurettes that are a total of almost an hour long:

Inside Dragonball Z: Interview with Christopher R. Sabat (series voice director, voice of Vegeta, Piccolo, and Yamcha)
Inside Dragonball Z: Interview with Sean Schemmel (who voices Goku and King Kai)
Justin Cook (voice of Raditz, adult Dende, and Super Buu) Shares His Headshot Collection.

These are all the memories of DBZ from the points of view of DBZ's Cast, FUNimation Staff, and fans of the series. I actually really enjoyed these, apart from the cheesy cosplay fan interviews. You get a sense of the inner workings of bringing DBZ to life in the USA, from FUNimation's infancy to the present.

All in all, I'd say this is the definitive version of Dragonball Z. Probably even better than Kai was. If you want to experience uncut DBZ perfection, then this release is for you. If you want a more fast paced version, go with DBZ Kai. Either way, you can't go wrong. Believe me I have both and never regretted my purchases.",1397088000,,2189,4.6875

6106217,5,B00GS4B7GS,"There are a lot of extreme opinions on this release, so I'm going to try to keep this review as unbiased as possible.  Unlike some fans, I don't have an inborn hatred of Funimation, and I grew up watching DBZ when it first started airing on Cartoon Network, so I've seen it the way it was ""originally"" intended.  I've also seen the way the picture looks on the ""Level Sets,"" so I have something to compare this to.

To start, I'll address the most divisive aspect: the picture.  If you're reading this, you've no doubt already seen reviewers griping about (or praising) the image cropping.  I grew up watching DBZ when it first aired, so I was raised on the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I was thus disappointed when I learned that these Blu-ray releases were cropped to 16:9 widescreen.  Now, after having some time to watch it, I'm still not 100% okay with the cropping.  As an older fan, I'd rather see the whole picture.  HOWEVER, I will say that the cropping is handled well.  You (usually) don't lose any important image details, and it also works surprisingly well in other cases. The image is a bit claustrophobic at times, but in all honesty, it doesn't detract too much from the overall viewing experience.  Some people may prefer that to having black bars on both sides of the screen anyway.  The only REAL complaint I have with the cropping is the end credits sequence.  In this case, they didn't just crop the top and bottom, they zoomed in, so you lose a LOT of the picture from all sides.  I don't understand why they did this, and it seems pretty dang stupid, but hey, it's only the end credits.

Regarding the picture quality itself, frankly I think it's great.  I've seen a lot of people moaning about the lack of film grain and the loss of ""detail"", but honestly, I just don't see it.  First off, film grain is not detail, it's an imperfection.  I've seen the picture on the ""Level sets"", and while the image itself was crisp, the level of film grain was really noticeable, almost to the point of being distracting. There's still a little bit of grain in this release, but much reduced, and I think it makes the picture look even better.  And the loss of detail, if any, is barely noticeable.  Unless you're really nitpicking, you probably won't see it either.  And the colors are nice and vibrant.  Sometimes they're a little in-your-face, but for the most part, they really make the picture come alive.  It's pretty awesome to watch.

EDIT: After finally being able to compare this release to the orange bricks, I can safely say the blu-ray is HANDS DOWN better in terms of picture.  Even with resolution and cropping aside, the orange bricks' picture simply looks...drab and dull in comparison.  In fact, in some parts it looks plain ugly.  The blu-ray release's picture is superior in every way - including color, resolution, sharpness, and yes, the cropping.  If you're on the fence as whether to buy these blu-rays or the orange brick set, my advice is go with the blu-ray.  You'll thank yourself later.

As far as the sound, you have three options: English dubbing with Japanese music in 5.1, English dubbing with the American  music, or the original Japanese dialogue (in mono) and music.  Be warned - for fans of the Bruce Faulconer score, his soundtrack doesn't start until episode 68.  In my initial review, I said that Faulconer's music was on the whole season; this is not so.  All prior episodes have a soundtrack composed by Nathan Johnson (reason being that back in the day, Funimation hadn't taken over the series until partway through this saga).  Personally, I'm a fan of the Faulconer score, but the Japanese music has grown on me a lot. I really like the option of having all three versions, and this is sure to please anyone.  Nothing really to gripe about here.

You also have the ability to watch the episodes ""marathon"" style, which means watching them in sequence without opening/closing credits.  This is a pretty cool feature that lets you watch the show without constant interruptions.  As far as packaging itself, it's nice and compact, and only on four discs.  I was kinda sad there was no booklet insert without any facts/character bios/whatnot that you got with the orange bricks.  That would have been cool, but if you're buying this set, you may already know a lot about the show anyway.  The special features include interviews with Christopher Sabat and Sean Schemmel, a ""headshot"" collection by Justin Cook, as well as some trailers.  I was a little disappointed that we didn't get more in terms of special features, but then again, this wasn't the reason I got this set.

So in summary, my recommendation is YES, buy this set.  Yeah the cropping may suck, but really, this is probably the best the show has ever looked (definitely better than the orange DVDs).  And there are enough features/options to keep most people happy.  It's not perfect, but I am satisfied overall.  And yes, I will probably buy season three when it's released.  So there's my honest, hopefully unbiased review.  If you're still reading this, I hope this was enough to help you make a decision!  Peace.",1395619200,62,5124,4.688340807174888

I will eagerly continue buying the rest of the seasons of this BD edition of DBZ and hoping that Funimation releases the Dragon Ball series in this format also, after a glimpsed of it in the episode where Bulma had a flashback of her adventures with Goku when they were kids, and the quality of the video of that flashback is simply magnificent.

6106237,5,B00GS4B7GS,"This series was the start of it all for me here. While I personally think the series really took after the Frieza saga, this is a good chance to revisit probably the least popular part of the series. All the speculation about how it would look has been thrown out the window for me. Things are crisp and clear and there's no trace of blurring edges on HD screens. While I was willing to take the risk in purchasing this, I can safely say this needs to be purchased by any DBZ fan. And for the price they are currently asking for season 3 pre orders, I'll be making that purchase here very soon.",1394150400,,594,4.219298245614035

6106239,5,B00GS4B7GS,"16:9 HD DBZ, what more can you ask for?? The cropping is top notch, so is the picture and sound quality, far superior to the short-lived and quickly abandoned 'level sets'.  I wish all the net-nerds would calm the crap down with all of the ""oh, its not the original viewing experience, its for the uninitiated"" guess what, if you want the original experience, find a CRT television, and some VHS copies of DBZ in a pawnshop somewhere, and enjoy the grainy crappiness of standard definition VHS...

Also, I lived in Japan during the original broadcasting(I was an army brat)... I watched them in Japanese when they were new, so most everyone who is complaining about the ""originality"" don't know what they are talking about, every DBZ episode that has ever aired, or dubbed into english is NOT the way it was written, they have been HEAVILY edited for content and language to make them 'kid friendly'... they have probably never seen an original episode.",1393977600,2,953,4.7696969696969695

Season one review
http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFALKLSDKCDB/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9IB1M4&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=",1393804800,,532,5.65
6106241,1,B00GS4B7GS,"I bought season 2 while I was in my Best Buy a few days ago, and it was the only copy on the shelf. I knew Amazon still had it for $16.96 so I price matched it and got it. Not bad for 35 episodes, but not good on the restoration and quality of the episodes.

One downer was that in the main menu, if you go to the episodes you cannot choose a part of an episode you wish to go to. It forces you to start from the beginning. Not a big deal, but I frowned on it.

Video: It's obvious while watching that each episode has been stretched a little and zoomed in too much in order to fill the everyday 1:78 aspect ratio TVs we own. Some of the close ups on faces and battles show too much of the black lining and scenes of Nail and other namekians it's clear that all of the grain has been removed making the color flow seem unnatural. It looks almost like bleeding colors. The colors are vibrant, but overly saturated and without the grain, still shots of Frieza and Vegeta looked fuzzy. While Captain Ginyu fought with Goku, lots of times it would only show his forehead to his center chin. The cropping is better than the orange bricks, but the removal of originality of grain, overly saturated colors, and zoomed in filler just does not go well with it. It should have retained its 4:3 aspect ratio.

The closing credits have been horribly cropped and modified. So much, that you can't even see the green part of the dragon and Gohan runs at the bottom corner of the screen.

Audio: The audio is well done. It has all three options of English with Japanese music, Bruce Faulconer's score, and original Japanese mono. However, it does not have the original American opening ""Rock the Dragon"". I was disappointed.

Conclusion: I own the Level sets, and they're by far superior to this. I will NOT purchase any future releases of these season sets and I do not recommend anybody else do so either. I say this not just because of the aspect ratio/format modified, but more so because the video ""quality"" has been tampered with and corrupted causing negative after effects.",1393718400,5,2066,4.397905759162303

Season 2 covers the ""Namek"" and ""Captain Ginyu"" sagas and leads the heroes to the planet Namek. Here, they face off against Captain Ginyu and his elite fighters  -who serve the vicious Frieza-, all while on a quest to find the Namekian Dragon Balls and keep them out of his evil hands. With more fast action, and an unforgettable villain, I highly recommend this blu ray release for Dragonball and Anime fans alike!",1393286400,,516,4.733333333333333
6106251,4,B00GS4B7GS,"This is a nice ""update"" (or clean up) to the original version. The only thing that I was really hoping for from Funimation this time was have a true version.
What I mean by this is when the opening starts I'd like to hear the original Japanese opening and not the crappy American crap. I can still hear it if I switching between languages, but I'd like to hear the original music without having to read subtitles. They have the original Japanese score and even the original Japanese ending track but still missing that.
I've been a big fan of DragonBall Z since I was little and think this is a good update to the orange box set as far as picture and sound goes.",1393286400,,662,4.304

Looks like 2014 is going to be the year of the Super Sayan on 16:9 blu-ray ! I give it a five for all movies coming in the box and shipping earlier than expected plus it came with extra features:D

However behind all that arrogance there is also great fear inside him that one day one warrior or better said a saiyan will rise an achieve a power that has only been mentioned in legend and could mean the end of his reign.,1393200000,,483,4.377777777777778

Along with the enhanced visuals; it contains worth while special features with the two greatest voices to come from DBZ and has three different styles of watching. It has English dub with the Japanese soundtrack, English dub with American soundtrack, and Japanese dub with the original soundtrack. On top of that it has a marathon mode that makes the episodes flow smoothly into each other. Some people dislike it due to the cropping but really isn't noticeable. This is by far the best way to watch DBZ and I hope they continue on all the way to season 9.",1393027200,,640,4.62280701754386

The story is how I remembered it when I was little, except for a few added bits that I did not see as a kid (Like Recoome flipping off Goku for his hidden power level), there was one thing that concerned me though, the last two or three episodes of the season had somewhat of a blur problem, where details on the left side of the screen were as crisp as always, and where some of the picture on the right side was blurred.

The colors are bolder, The scenes are more crisp and the sound is excellent. it just looks great in High Definition, I can definitely  see a big leap up in terms of picture quality. I also love the packaging art, they all connect to make a montage of DBZ Characters.  Season 2 and 3 are probably my favorite of all the DBZ Sagas. I would recommend this release to anyone who loves DBZ and enjoyed watching it on Toonami growing up. You can't beat it for the price and quality.

Take it from me, Im a HUGE DBZ fan and I was one of the people who went to FUNimation's site when they held an OPEN survey for what people would want, 4:3 or 16:9.  We all see who won that debate.  Maybe if this was back in 1999 when HDTV's weren't that big yet, this would be good for 4:3.  But having a 65'...4:3 would suck.  All in all the special features are cool, the sound is 5/5, the picture is 5/5.  Dont listen to the haters who lost on an OPEN survey.  Buy it, enjoy it, Rock the Dragon.

I don't care about your excuses. It doesn't matter. HD TV's do not excuse 16:9. That's not okay. The art on the box is horrible. The voice acting sucks. The English dub sucks. FUNimation sucks. You've re-re-re-re-re- released this and it STILL sucks. You're better off color correcting the Japanese Dragon Box footage, but Toei won't let you put your hands on it because you suck so bad.

People, this series is supposed to be in 4:3. FUNimation is cutting off 20% of the picture, and screwing up the colors. These colors are not what was in the original Japanese broadcast.
