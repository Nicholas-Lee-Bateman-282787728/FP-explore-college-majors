8325123,2,B000G5SBZU,"Geared for English-speaking tourists, this 30-minute DVD captures crisp images of Burgundy and the Loire but offers little historic or cultural depth. Quick pit stops in Beaune, Dijon, and Amboise leave little time to marvel at architectural interests. A crisp picture is the main perk of this film, and while it looks crystal clear on a computer screen, be aware that this disk will not function in home DVD players.",1170806400,,417,4.9714285714285715
