Before we moved across the country, the library in our town had this DVD and we seemed to have it checked out all of the time since my three, nearly four year old son loved it. It's been over a year since we found it and since our new local library doesn't carry it and he wants to keep watching it, he will get it for Christmas. It's not a long DVD, but geared at 4-7 year olds with Iggy and Geo - computer and robot to help with explanations. Lots of real volcanic footage and a fun, easy ""volcanic"" experiment are included. Even my daughter, who is 2 years younger than her brother, enjoyed watching this DVD. My kids were always calling me over to ""watch this, mommy"" - another spectacular volcanic explosion. Check it out if your kids love volcanoes.",1384992000,,839,4.3164556962025316
