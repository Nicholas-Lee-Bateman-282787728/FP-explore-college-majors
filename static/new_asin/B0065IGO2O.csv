The information is still important to know to help others less discerning to know the truth in God's Word, and to point out the errors in false teaching.

I was raised a typical Baptist, baptised young, and very little Bible study in my busy young life.  A well-meaning friend introduced me to WoF books including Hagin, Hinn, Joyce Meyer, etc.  My foolish itching ears read them eagerly!  Then my mother-in-law introduced me to New Age teachings including Theosophy, Transcendental Meditation, Shamanism, Reiki, etc.  My foolish itching ears thought WoF Christian and New Age teachings similar and compatible.  Indeed, they are similar and compatible for a worldly lost soul.

After many years, God in His mercy allowed the scales to fall from my eyes.  I was reading a WoF book describing Jesus dying on the cross, then being buried, then going to Hell and tortured for our atonement,...eeeeRRRKKKK! ....Wha, Wha, WHAT?!!!!  Even as Biblically illiterate as I was, I had read the gospels at least once, and I did not remember that last nugget being in there.  I remembered that Jesus said to the one thief that he would be with Him in Paradise.  And, I remembered that He said on the cross, ""It is finished.""  So, I dusted off my Bible and reread all of the gospels.  Then, I realized that if this author got something so important as the atonement wrong, what other poisons are they sneaking into their teachings.

Since that awakening, I rededicated my life to Christ, became soundly born-again saved, and thought I was gratefully done with those disgusting WOLVES.  Recently I moved, and discovered that my beloved niece belongs to a WoF megachurch and is enthralled by many WoF teachers.  She will not hear a word against them.  She declares that her old Baptist church is ""law"" and her new church is ""grace.""  She thinks that I am a closed-minded hater.  Her behavior is amazingly cultist!  So, the vicious cycle begins again.  I am praying for her, and sadly studying this heresy again to gently point out the false teachings and, like the noble Bereans, guide her to the truth in God's Word.

I, also, recommend going to Justin Peters Ministry website for much more information on discernment and false teachings.",1475798400,2,2392,4.820638820638821
8493374,5,B0065IGO2O,"Very well done, showing how some popular preachers are getting away from the Bible message, but still using Bible verses (albeit out of context) to support their unhealthy message.",1456444800,,180,5.241379310344827
8493375,5,B0065IGO2O,"I don't own this DVD set but I have seen the same presentation live.  Justin Peters is just an incredible asset to the Christian church.  I was raised in Word of Faith heresy and Peters systematically and exegetically dismantles their theology and shows you what the Bible really says on these matters.  If you were raised in TBN and Daystar style churches and always knew something wasn't quite right, this DVD is a must have!",1455840000,,427,4.666666666666667
8493376,5,B0065IGO2O,"I watched this dvd know some of the false teachers on this vidoe, but did not really realize how far away from the real gospel they are!!:-( very sad  for those who are getting deceived  I encourage you to get this vidoe!!!!",1397088000,,224,4.309523809523809
8493377,5,B0065IGO2O,"I first came across Justin Peters when he visited England. It took a while for me to get my hands on this DVD, but the wait was worth it. It is very detailed, covering every aspect of the false teachings of the Word of Faith movement. I understand that a later edition has now been published. I am looking to buy it.",1393718400,,316,4.112903225806452
8493378,5,B0065IGO2O,"Excellent exegesis of the word of God concerning  false prophets, teachers, and heretics claiming to be ""Christians"".  Biblically sound, and right on point.  I could not recommend more highly, especially for new believers, and those who have been believers for some time, but who have not been trained in the rightly dividing of God's Word.  Outstanding job Justin!!!",1383868800,,367,5.275862068965517
8493379,5,B0065IGO2O,"This is the best and most accessible introduction to the word of faith movement.

This DVD series is very easy to understand, well researched and there is never a dull moment in this DVD. I have read a number of books on the subject and it can be quite dry, but this is the first resource on the subject that is really engaging. The word of faith position is accurately portrayed and dealt with using scripture. Justin Peters takes good care not to misrepresent them letting you hear recordings of what these word of faith preachers themselves teach on the subject.

The real eye opener was the lecture dealing with the doctrines of the word of faith teachers. The little god theology, the reason behind the health/wealth/prosperity teaching, their view of the atonement (which differs from biblical Christianity), etc.

If you are looking for a resource to learn more about the word of faith movement in an accessible format, or if you are looking for a gift for a friend who is in the word of faith movement, this is the best. Period.",1377820800,4,1036,4.6502732240437155
8493380,5,B0065IGO2O,Justin Peter's teaching is a must have for anyone who wants to understand the heresies presented in the Word of Faith movement and the biblical truths that it suppresses.,1368489600,2,170,4.896551724137931
8493381,5,B0065IGO2O,"Justin Peters has my greatest respect and admiration for his work, and perhaps most notably, for his warm and genuine demeanor. Unlike some, this man points out heresies and heretics without name calling, ranting and raving, or skewing the facts. Many folks might get pretty upset, in fact watching this video and well, I was indeed very upset. But Justin's attitude is great for me, as I still need to grow.

His work is Biblical and accurate, and it is by far the best video I have seen on the Word of Faith movement. (Here on out WoF) This is a great concern and serious issue in the church that not long ago I knew nothing about. His Call to Discernment might also be said, A Reminder that the Path is Narrow, thought, not entirely the same thing :) Wolves are ravaging the flocks, but in my honest opinion, I am not so sure the true flock is being affected, as people want their ears tickled, and are getting what they want. None the less much damage is being done, and I have come to learn of late that a few folks back home have been turned away from sound doctrine and our now into this movement. This movie brought me to tears, sobbing like crazy at the end. This is such an important eye opening DVD, well worth more then 1000 times it's weight in gold, lol and no, I really aint exaggerating much. This needs to be gotten out to all the churches in my opinion, the WoF teachings are straight up patently un-Biblical lies. People need to be warned, and you can tell that it was with a caring heart that Justin sounded the warning cry. Don't pass this up. Share it with your friends! God Bless",1336608000,7,1602,4.34
