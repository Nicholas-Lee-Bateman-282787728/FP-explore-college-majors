5007906,4,B006NOC1S6,"Araki is an always interesting director.  Don't be dissuaded by one negative review.

The premise of this movie is somewhat similar to his earlier work ""The Doom Generation.""

There is no correlation to ""Shortbus.""  What's this guy talking about?",1301270400,27,246,5.230769230769231
5007907,2,B006NOC1S6,"Araki is imitating recent entries in the genre of extreme cinema (like SHORTBUS) but he has crafted something derivative and forgettable.  This movie is short, fast, colorful, and supremely superficial.  Wilde's famous epigram seems ironically suitable here: those who look beneath the surface do so at their own peril.  In this case, there's nothing underneath the glossy, sexy cover.  The ultimate cinematic c*ck-tease.  In the end, I think it's Araki's desire to be ultra hip that undoes this film.  When fashion and taste have moved on, this movie will remain mired in its own particular cultural moment.  And that in and of itself is ok, since many great films end up that way.  But that's all there is to this movie-- no commentary, no message, no critique.  Just low-budget teenage sexcapades with all the depth of an uninspired fashion spread.  it's intensely disappointing.  MYSTERIOUS SKIN was an incredible film.  This is a big letdown for Araki fans.",1301184000,11,962,5.057324840764331

5007909,5,B006NOC1S6,"Kaboom sees Gregg Araki returning to his early film origins of trashy plots, throwaway sex and an endless parade of pretty actors.
All wrapped up, of course, in a gleeful, accelerated sensibility that is unique to Araki's sensibility. I loved Kaboom, even tho, like too

5007910,2,B006NOC1S6,"With Kaboom, Araki is, more or less, attempting to combine the dreamlike quality of his masterpiece, Mysterious Skin, with the energy and the over-the-top style of his earlier Teen Apocalypse trilogy, which featured Totally F***ed Up (my favorite of the trilogy), The Doom Generation (a film that I am, very slowly, beginning to understand the brilliance of) and Nowhere (an ugly film that I dislike more and more every day). This attempt of his works to a certain degree, but I think the main problem here is that he cannot quite bring anything new or interesting to the table. His high energy approach is no longer as effective as it once was, and so while one can admire the picture from an aesthetic perspective, more often than not the picture does not able to sustain itself like it truly should in order to feel fully realized. No matter what approach I take, this film does not truly feel complete, despite every subplot and plot hole being miraculously resolved by the time the film nears completion, and despite a cast of characters with plenty of distinction, characterization, color, and originality.

No matter what approach I take, this film does not truly feel complete, despite every subplot and plot hole being miraculously resolved by the time the film nears completion, and despite a cast of characters with plenty of distinction, characterization, color, and originality. Kaboom is a film that boasts a number of impressive performances, particularly from Juno Temple who I think gives a performance worthy of being remembered in the next twenty years. We get a lot of creative ideas mixed into this film's novel worth of plot that has everything from perverse love triangles to political conspiracies. The film, however, always feels episodic, as if there isn't a clear thread that we are meant to follow.

The film jumps from subplot to subplot, trying to paint a massive picture full of unique ideas and cinematic power, but the end result feels wholly misguided and misinterpreted. The film sounds better in concept and in theory than it does in execution. I could describe the entire plot and everything that occurs within its unusually short runtime, and the average reader would likely think that it sounded terrific and entertaining. The problem comes with actually watching the film and realizing that it does not keep up with itself as well as it should. Much of the film happens in flashback, which is a refreshing approach at first but then grows surprisingly tiresome. We are unable to keep up with the events of the film, so the film feels the need to guide us as if there's any risk of feeling rushed with such a bizarre plot. There are moments of this film that are nothing less than completely terrifying, and there are moments that are very funny, and there are even some moments that are achingly truthful. However, when you put it all together in the way that this film does, it comes across as less like David Lynch and more like M. Night Shyamalan, only without the suspense or the power that even his weakest films manage to muster up. Kaboom has plenty going for it in the image department, and in a way I could easily see this film being admired just for how visually exciting and creative it is. The issue with this, however, comes from the fact that this film has no reason in the world to look this good.

Even if someone did like this film and enjoy it completely, there is one major problem with it. I'm going to be honest, I actually did enjoy this film a lot more than you may even realize based on what I've written. Much of what I have written comes more from an objective observation than from my actual viewing experience. However, what absolutely killed this film for me was its ending. It wasn't even how the ending unfolded. I was completely on board with this film's wild theories and themes involving underground cults and incest. Even when the film basically turned into an action movie I was into it. However, the last moments of this film are extremely weak for a film with this kind of energy. I wholly believe that Gregg Araki wanted to merely make a fun little piece of artistic entertainment, but he has to be completely crazy to ever even entertain the idea that people could find the final image of this film to be at all satisfying given what was happening up until that point. I was completely on board with this film, flaws and all, but its final moments are what ultimately kill what is otherwise a perfectly fun film.",1380499200,4,5327,4.707395498392283

5007916,4,B006NOC1S6,"John Waters approached Gregg Araki at the premiere of either ""Mysterious Skin"" or ""Smiley Face"" (I can't remember which) and personally requested that Gregg's next film take a trip back to ""classic Araki territory."" Hence, ""KABOOM""!

I won't spoil the plot because I feel that one should definitely go into this foray as clueless as possible for the purpose of expository surprises and shock preservation. However, I will start this review by saying that those unfamiliar with the director's previous work (and unacclimated to the social commentaries wrapped inside unbelievably tawdry plotlines fraught with originally insane one-liners) might loathe this picture, as it is sort of set up to be a film for Araki purists. All the familiar elements are here: the angst filled, witty dialog from the Teen Apocalypse Trilogy (""Totally F***ed Up"", ""The Doom Generation"" and ""Nowhere""), the psycho and sexual tension of ""The Living End"" and ""Splendor"", the absurdity of ""Smiley Face"" and at times, the intensity of ""Mysterious Skin"".

But being more than just a throwback for fans, to me I think this piece of celluloid is a visual and auditory poem of sorts. The soundtrack selections (featuring artists such as Ladytron, Cut Copy & Explosions In The Sky) connect scenes like perfect puzzle pieces to reveal each enigmatic plot point as the film carries us along an initially confusing, yet thoroughly intriguing path. But it's the VISUAL poetry that gives ""Kaboom"" its true beauty ~ the wash of blue light adorning Smith's fantasy of Thor after the film opens, for example, as well as the scene of Smith discovering the mysterious red head in the bathroom stall.

Whatever thier agenda, be it shady or sexual, each character is extremely likeable, which is a first for an Araki film in my humble opinion. The cast (Thomas Dekker, Haley Bennett, Juno Temple) is stellar (HELEN STELLAR...;) and each role has been perfectly assigned to both thier respective actor's strengths and weaknesses ~ the one exception being Kelly Lynch as Smith's mother. As much as I love her as an actress and an individual, she (literally) phones in her performance here, which is my only complaint in the casting department.

Araki trademarks? Yep, they're all here as well! The close up shots on each character's appetizing/disgusting food choices that are either in the process of, or about to be ingested...the vibrant colors seen in both the wardrobe and the uniquely designed dream-like sets that one will never get to see in real life...and more important, Araki's innate ability to stay in touch with mankind's awkward confusion in transitioning from teenager to adult, whatever the generation may be.

As much as I loved the way it ended, I think the pacing contributed to what I DIDN'T like about the film as a whole. It's nothing but a fast cavalcade of dialogue which culminates into the big reveal, then KABOOM...the film is over. It's almost the the first draft of the third act was filmed and printed instead of being fleshed out in rewrites. The film's conclusion might have benefited with less talk and more action, despite being extremely action packed already...which will make sense when you view it for the first time.

So is this film a drama, comedy, science fiction, suspense or horror film? The answer is YES to all five. A feat that I think only Gregg Araki can pull off. I believe that fact, in and of itself, will either make or break this film for the viewer. As for me, I count it as a new future ""cult classic"" for the 21st Century, and a film I'm proud to include in both my DVD and Araki collections, respectively. :)",1365033600,,3624,4.894136807817589
5007917,4,B006NOC1S6,"Finally, a movie where actors sound and act contemporary age appropriate and not scripted by older, cloistered L.A./N.Y. writers that were left clueless the moment they stepped out of their high school graduation. The storyline is an odd assortment of seen before subplots (therefore not too creative) of a secret society out to control the world through nuclear weapons and helped by an animal masked posse as well as offspring with genetically gifted extra-human witchy type powers. Good cast selection; good acting and dialogue. On the downside the directing and storyline was rough and lacked an even flow with enough holes that it was difficult to connect with anyone or anything. I thought it was mis-titled until the final scene. A 100+ ""Special Thanks"", a usual giveaway of a cheap production, but in this case there were enough positives to let it slide.

When I first saw the title and cover I was thinking Bollywood - wrong! Anyone who puts a film together and calls themselves ""Why Not Productions"", ""Desperate Pictures"", ""Wild Bunch"" and ""Super Crispy Entertainment"" deserves some props and a hug.

There is, however, a lot of implied sex for all sexual persuasions. Outside of the usual female upper torso titillation every thing else is camera angle, your guess is as good as any, views.",1341187200,,1302,4.9953917050691246
5007918,4,B006NOC1S6,"Gregg Araki continues his daring sojourn into the arena that other filmmakers avoid - frank sexual adventures of every kind, characters whose placement in the story is often like window dressing for effect, and yet out of it all comes a fascinating if at time discombobulating tale that appeals to a certain audience - and doesn't mind if the rest of the folks who don't approve of his antics even attend!

The film follows the life of one Smith (Thomas Dekker) and his everyday life in the dorm - hanging out with his arty, sarcastic best friend Stella (Haley Bennett), hooking up with a beautiful free spirit named London (Juno Temple), lusting for his gorgeous but dim surfer roommate Thor (Chris Zylka).  Smith parties, sleeps around with both men (Jason Olive, Andy Fischer-Price) and women in various combinations. He's bisexual, is about to turn 19 and is having strange dreams which seem to work their way into his life. There's gay sex, lesbian sex, witchcraft, men in animal masks, murder and some secret organization - it all gets turned upside-down after one fateful, terrifying night when all the signs of Smith's dreams seem to come together in a apocalyptic fusion that involves Smith's father (Michael James Spall), Smith's hedonistic mother (Kelly Lynch), and visits from the Messiah! It is a sci-fi story centered on the sexual awakening of a group of college students.

Dekker somehow carries this film due to his skills as an actor but also his complete involvement in what is obviously Araki's secondary persona. It is a crazy film, rich in color, at many times ludicrous, and at other times very sexy - you know, the way Gregg Araki continues to make these solid little art house movies. It would be silly to fault KABOOM for being shallow or unserious; its whole mode of being is profoundly antiserious, playfully assaulting any form of earnestness other than Smith's emo melancholy.

I did feel compelled to leave this review for 1 reason.

When it comes to movies everybodies tastes are different. Some may love a movie while others hate the same movie.

I for one (and see im not alone) hated this joke/junk of a movie.

Yes, I HATED it.

But why is it those who hate a movie are attacked by those who liked it?

Great, you LOVED it. Good for you. But please understand that just because you like or love a movie does not mean those who hated the same movie are clueless nuts who deserve to have folks dis them via comments.

This movie SUCKED, in MY OPINION.

If you don't like the fact I or others HATED this JUNK movie too bad. Get over it.

I could say nasty things to/about those who loved this movie since I HATED it... just as those who loved it are dissing those who didnt, but that accomplishes nothing so I won't bother.

I'll just end this by saying..Watch it and form your own opinion.

Certainly the idea of an Araki horror movie is intriguing, and maybe he'll try again in a few years after the tiresome stubble/messy hair craze has died (Isn't it dead YET?!). I did manage to get through the movie, but it was not as good as it could have been with a different star, or with the same star after a shampoo and shave.

5007926,4,B006NOC1S6,"Gregg Araki's films share a special signature. As a filmmaker, his interest towards certain themes are aptly exploited in different and peculiar ways.

In Kaboom, Araki plays again with that which surpasses normal humanity, redefining it in the process.

We find ourselves immersed in a story about college, young men and women, mysterious murders, secret societies and conspiracy theories that, somehow, mingle together with a surreal sensitivity. The first scene takes us to Smith's mind, an 18-year-old student... or, more exactly, to a dream he has been having frequently. After that he starts masturbating while fantasizing with his roommate Thor, a blonde surfer with perfect abs. Smith, however, doesn't want to be labeled... he considers himself neither gay nor bisexual. He has indeed sexual encounters with boys and girls, but his best friend Stella is convinced that he leans more towards guys. Stella is a lesbian that finds conflict in a risky relationship with a girl that has, to put it mildly, supernatural abilities.

At the same time, Smith finds out that a girl from college, one that appears in his dreams, has been murdered by men in black disguised with animal masks. Except he cannot be sure if he's imagining things because of the hallucinogen drugs he takes or simply because he's becoming paranoid and losing his mind in the process. It's college and there are drugs and alcohol everywhere; here actually one of Araki's favorite actors, James Duval, interprets the typical school ""stoner"", who pretty much sums up Stella's assertion: ""college is just an intermission between high school and the rest of your life. Four years of having sex, making stupid mistakes and experiencing stuff"".

When Stella has sex with her girlfriend there is a special luminosity that announces a supernatural element... and when Smith agrees to engage in sexual intercourse with a lighthearted girl named London he also experiences a weird luminescence which he attributes to drugs. In the same way he cannot define himself as homosexual or bisexual, he is also constantly escaping out of normal consciousness, which is made clear with the dream at the beginning of the film. Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan would correlate the privileged mode in which we capture our own selves through narcissistic investment with the type of knowledge based on the 'illusion of consciousness' in which it is implied that the entire reality could become accessible to the mind, turned inside-out, and as a result, it could be illuminated and made transparent. Kaboom deals closely with this illusion of consciousness; it explores the mindset of Smith taking him constantly to different extremes of realities.

This illusion, however, is insufficient if Smith is to find his place in the world, and he experiences its limitation when he confronts the phenomenon of the strange -with all its connotations, the stranger, the alien, the unfamiliar- here exemplified by the animal mask men that start chasing him; it doesn't matter if they are after him or if he's only imagining it, but the important thing is that he experiences fear (and thanks to the director's skills, we also experience the suspense of the persecutions); this seriously puts into question the very possibility of auto-transparency or auto-knowledge for Smith.

Perhaps this is all linked with Smith's lack of a parental figure, as Lacanian theory would tell us it is the nom de pere or name of the father that inscribes the subject into the symbolic order. Smith has a loving mother, but he has never met his father who was conveniently reported dead in a car accident just before he was born. Without the name of the father, without the castration which takes place when the father removes any possibility of the mother having the phallus, it's clear that the individual, in this case Smith, would always be out of place or at least displaced from society. In a world ruled by heterosexual normativity, Smith has no clear space or location, and in the same way sexuality means for him to wander around aimlessly, he also starts slipping into an uncomfortable fissure that brings forth elements of reality and also from his personal oneiric world.

I think no other director could have pulled this off. Kaboom succeeds in forcing us, the viewers, to reevaluate what we think, to defy established knowledge. When Smith finds out the truth behind the murders and the truth behind his father's death, he will no longer be able to see the world as he used to. But then again doesn't the same thing happen to us, as we grow up?",1317772800,7,5105,5.398996235884567

5007928,3,B006NOC1S6,"I seriously hope nobody watches this...

The first half of Kaboom deals with nothing but a few college kids being open and experimenting with their sexuality.  That's it.  Besides the occasional funny and immature sarcasm, there's *nothing* else of value.

The film consists of two main characters (a boy who likes other boys sexually, and a bad-tempered girl who likes other girls sexually).  They are both best friends, and don't have a problem being open with each other concerning their encounters with the sexual partners of their choosing, so expect to see the two of them constantly in their dorm rooms and sharing openly exactly what is on their mind.

Pretty soon, more characters come into the picture and now it's focused entirely on boys and girls having sex with each other.  See what I mean?  There's really no reason whatsoever to watch such a crappy movie.  But wait!  There *is* a reason!

After those atrocious 45 minutes of nothingness are over with, the storyline becomes funny.  Why?  Because it turns out the girlfriend of the girl is a psychotic freak with mental issues.  This character is portrayed as humorous though because she tortures the girl in a way that would be more appropriate for an *extremely* low budget horror flick mixed with comedy.

What about the boy you ask?  Well, he's busy spending time on the beach searching for men to sleep with.  He's not as funny or as interesting as his female friend.

Once that portion of the film is finally over with (and hey, if you've made it this far, you must either be really bored or really in high hopes that something good is coming, and you'd be right) the movie actually tries to tell a story about this mysterious cult that hides their identity by wearing animal masks.  They come out at night and torture people at the college.

The ending was terrible beyond belief (concerning the cult) but I suppose it's supposed to be that way.  After all, when you spend half of the time telling no story whatsoever, why bother wrapping up the events in a satisfying and conclusive manner?  I'll leave you with a question.  For those who've played that old video game Mortal Kombat 3.  What's the biggest fatality in the game?  It's the same thing as the ending to this movie.

Like most Greg Araki films, this one is hard to describe or classify.  It is equal parts a light romantic comedy, satire pointing out the fluid nature of sexuality,  murder mystery and story about an international conspiracy.  The story is intentionally funny in parts, unintentionally laughable in others, and frightening at the same time. Acting is capable, the special effects reflect the tiny budget of the film, and some of the scene changes don't flow together very well.  Overall, it can be an enjoyable diversion for those who don't take their movies too seriously, with a reminder that people are not always what they seem to be.

Like any Araki movie, Kaboom is riddled with sex, angst and absurdity. In earlier installments like The Doom Generation and Nowhere, Araki successfully conveyed the confusion and naivety of entering adulthood through a revolving door of bizarre characters and visuals. While Kaboom may share qualities of Araki's earlier work, it's just the shell to an absolute mess of a film.

Kaboom starts off with traces of mindless fun. Dekker is perfect for the lead in an Araki film, and practically carries this film (a couple co-stars are good too). Despite the film being an anarchic void of sex and silliness, it keeps trying to make its poorly paced key plot-line a (painfully) serious matter. Unfortunately, you won't care; you just want to see Thomas Dekker take his clothes off and screw his roommate (Chris Zylka), and appreciate the vivid costume and set choices.

Perhaps it's our shallow, materialist present-day culture that ultimately destroys Kaboom. It seems that ten seconds can't go by without someone's cell phone ringing, an email being answered, or a product being referenced. It's as distracting in the film as it is in real life, and his characters reflect this paper-thin ""complexity."" To make matters worse, Araki tries desperately to show off his ""understanding"" of the modern youth culture. Kaboom displays these grueling efforts to be ""edgy"" through incessant pop culture references. It's not.

I never thought I'd EVER find myself bored during an Araki film, but it happened. He showed the world he was capable of making quintessential teen movies in the early 90's, as well as creating cinematic brilliance in Mysterious Skin (my favorite movie). How one goes from that to Smiley Face and now Kaboom, is somewhat depressing. I don't know if Araki is having a midlife crisis, but I hate to see him squander his talent like this. Hopefully he can gift us with another angsty masterpiece in the future.",1307923200,5,2256,4.99468085106383
5007933,3,B006NOC1S6,"Kaboom starts off sexy, different, and interesting. However, it eventually becomes complicated and boring. It should've just been about college students having sex, but there had to be some overblown conspiracy plot thrown in. Thomas Dekker, who plays Smith, is cute as always, and the actor who played Thor was hot. The movie would've have been much better if Smith and Thor would've hooked up on numerous occasions.",1307664000,4,417,5.147058823529412
5007934,5,B006NOC1S6,"I've never seen anything like it before. The weirdest and most interesting movie I've seen. It is hilarious and ""dramatic"", but I liked it. I loved Smiley Face, the Anna Faris weed cupcake movie with Jim from the Office, and since it was directed by the same director I think I should check it out.",1307404800,2,298,4.4363636363636365
5007935,5,B006NOC1S6,"Kaboom was my perfect movie, as I knew it would be!  It is a pinacle that fully synthesiszes and compiles the style of Gregg Araki, while wonderfully showcasing undeniable allusionary connections to other artform's of music and modern psychology, mythology, sexuality, and spirituality.  I loved the information he was able to capture cinematically.  Interestingly, it's all done through a humorous trek through the reckless abandon of youth in college.

As I watched the movie, I felt compelled to scribe qualities and essences that came to mind as I watched.  Adjectively, I found the film to be funny, enchanting, exhilarating, artisitc, spellbinding, and sexually intense.  The sexuality of the movie is very ripe, but it's prismed to the point of being the medium for a more playful, yet artisitc, release of language on an emotional, instinctual, and primal level playing fluidly in the subconscious of the psyche.  As is prime game for Gregg Araki, sexuality is examined outside any ordinary spectrum, where terms like ""straight, gay, and bi"" lose their validity as permanent fixtures of individuals.  Just to examine the physical objectivity of the ""sex on screen,"" I believe there are 3 straight scenes, one girl on girl scene, two guy on guy scenes, and one threesome of two guys and a girl.  However, throughout all scenes, there are only female breast, and no male penis, shown.  I note this point just because it ironically purports a more heteo-comfortable magneticism to the movie, while obviously commenting louder  through it's presentation on the fullness and mystery of sexuality beyond labels.

Also, sexuality becomes used as metaphor of other orgasmic experiences of ""la petite morte"" encapsulated to the point of an archetypal ""End of Days/Final Judgement"" with flavors reminsecent to that of Donnie Darko.  However, sexual saturation coniciding with the motiff of an ""apocalypse"" as a revelation, literally a revealing, crosses dimensions of interpretation ranging from sexual exposure and discovery, sexual climax, the end of the world catalysed through an extreme parnoid scenario of grandeur, 2012, an extreme altered mind peak experience, and other various examples of ""the end"" or ""the peak"" such as even the end of the moive, which while fittingly for Araki is abrupt, also left me feeling satisfied given the overall atmosphere of the moive.

Other aspects which the film weaves together include dreams, magick/psychics, conspiracy, tripping, religion.  Interestingly to me, these are all elements that I'm prone to enjoy collaborating, as I've found them present in a few of my favorite musical artists, Tool, Nine Inch Nails, and even Deftones.  For anyone capable of ""picking up what I'm putting down,"" a pastiche of ""what the fudge"" can be found in Kaboom that resonates with Tool's expressions through ""Rosetta Stoned,"" citing ""the chosen one syndrome"" of the ""holy SHucking Fit"" episode experienced.  Also, connection to Nine Inch Nails through a Day Zero/Year Zero comparison with ""The Beginning of the End"" also comes up pretty clear...no surprise, especially given Araki's musical penchant to include NIN in the score of previous works.  As an aside, using the phrase ""I'll drive"" to indicate a character's decision to be the one sexually instigating/dominating another is exactly parallel to a key message in Deftone's song ""Passenger,"" (which goes ""roll the windows down/this cool night air is curious/let the whole world look in/who cares who sees anything?/I'm your passenger.../Now to calm me/take me around again/don't pull over/this time won't you please/drive faster"").  Uhhh, yea, that's definitely ""it"" and such playful, clever insinuation of innuendo in language is exactly what all these musical artists, and Gregg Araki, are kings of creating in their artistic arenas...God I love this stuff!

Anyways, Kaboom was phenomenal and I'm glad to have brought it blindly and immediately, and I'm glad to hear about some of the awards it has won.  It's definitely a step above other movies to me, but unquestionably in a realm of its own regardless.  Enjoy.",1307232000,2,4103,5.289676425269645
5007936,3,B006NOC1S6,"Not sure what the director is trying to do here, but I think his aim was well beyond his grasp. On the one hand he tries to explore aspects of sexuality which you rarely see in movies... while the plot devolves into an absurdly stupid storyline that must be post-post-ironic with christian symbolism? Paganism also, and an unscary witch?  Supposed to be funny? Hope it's not supposed to be scary because that pretty much fails. The world ends in a big rapture/ symbolic orgasm? New Order/ Joy Division references? The sexual aspects that the director tries to explore are more successful than the rest of the movie which feels more like something a young film student would make....hmmm, like the character Smith. Maybe the movie is supposed to represent the bad movie that Smith would film. Movie of a dream of a film school student movie, about orgasms or something.
What was the deal with the ugly messed up redhead, is she Mary Magdalene? All the female characters are kinda unpleasant in some way. Smith was born like an immaculate conception brings about the rapture when he turns 19? Why 19? In any event the visuals, dialogue, and much of the cast could and should have been better.

Three stars for making me think, but no more since I don't really care.",1307232000,2,1263,4.684684684684685
5007937,4,B006NOC1S6,"I watched this last weekend, and while I don't think it's Araki's best (that spot, so far, is reserved for SPLENDOR), it's certainly not his worst by a long shot. I'm not sure if the guy that reviewed it down there has even seen it...

As for the movie it's kinda nuts that there isn't a Blu release, as with most of his more recent movies, they're MADE for blu! Araki's penchant for color and lighting is only shadowed by his amazing knack for music picks.

It's fun, it's light, with a classic Araki left field switch towards the end, while actually being quite satisfying. It's energetic, very well cast, and everything you go into watching an Araki film for. Not anywhere near as dark as Skin, but not quite as fluffy as Splendor. Well worth seeing, and a perfect blind buy if you're a fan of his other stuff.",1306800000,10,813,4.413333333333333

8501428,5,B006NOC1S6,"Gregg Araki is always interesting, and most of the time I didn't know where he was going with ""Kaboom"". At times I thought he was writing it as he went, but then I'd notice references to previous stuff and before I knew it, I was totally engrossed in the goings-on. I won't deny that there are certain continuity issues, but nothing major enough to keep me from liking the loveable character of Smith (Dekker), and the journey he's destined to take. Smith's character is written so well, slowly coming to terms with the events of his life, and relying so much on the support of his friends (and those, on him). It's a tight circle, and there are twists and turns and frustrations, culminating in the only logical ending.

I enjoyed ""Kaboom"" on many levels. I was never bored for a minute. I knew Araki would involve me in his roller coaster ride, and I wasn't disappointed. As weird as it got, the straight-forward enthusiasm of the fine cast never let up, and I was pleased with the film as a whole. I haven't had so much fun in a long time. Lighten up, nay-sayers; it's only a movie...and a fun one, too.",1415059200,,1106,4.448275862068965
8501429,4,B006NOC1S6,"This highly sexual but not particularly graphic flick by Gregg Araki caroms from good to bad to so-bad-it's-good and back around again. I'm of two minds about it: Araki probably would approve of that. Despite reservations, I'll give it a thumbs-up, but, as other reviewers have warned, some folks will hate it, so choose your co-viewers carefully.

Smith (Thomas Dekker) is a college student with a thing for his apparently straight roommate Thor and also for a young woman named London (Juno Temple). Araki doesn't seem to like labels, and most of the characters are sexually flexible. Some more openly acknowledge it than others. London specifically discusses Kinsey's 0-6 sliding scale of orientation on which very few people score a 0 or 6. Strange things start to happen around Smith. An enigmatic note identifies him as the ""chosen son."" He has disturbing encounters with men in animal masks. Smith thinks he might have witnessed a murder (he was high at the time), which leads him to question the story told to him by his mother about his father's death. He grows to believe his father is alive and is a leader of some bizarre secret cult that has selectively bred people with some psychic abilities, that has infiltrated governments, and that has an apocalyptic mission. Don't expect this ever to be a cult classic, but it has its pleasures for the type of viewer likely to choose it in the first place.",1411257600,,1411,4.830578512396694

8501432,1,B006NOC1S6,"Unfortunately like all of Gregg Araki's other films Kaboom hasn't been made available for sale in North America on Blu-ray leaving fans like me coughing up extra money for imports. I figured that since this disc is compatible with my blu-ray player that I'd be more than happy to pay a little extra. I mean, hey, you even get a sexy white case which is pretty uncommon.

This French release doesn't allow you to change audio or subtitle tracks on the fly. If you'd like to enjoy this film as it was originally presented you'll be sad to know that the French subtitles are forced when playing the English audio track. Even if you were living in France you would not be able to appreciate this movie in it's original language without subtitles polluting this visually beautiful film.

I thought the dark ages of DVD were over, but it's stuff like this that makes me regret trying to legally purchase the things that I like. I guess what this ultimately comes down to is I wish that there was a way for me to support Gregg's films in the United States without always being forced into the standard definition ghetto. I have a feeling the age of physical media will be dead and gone before I get what I want.

If you happen to be a French fan of queer cinema that has no problem with watching dubbed over foreign films then this is absolutely the release for you, but I somehow doubt you exist.

From what I have read online it seems the German release of this film is the way to go as it does not force subtitles and is region free.",1388620800,11,1529,4.373239436619718
