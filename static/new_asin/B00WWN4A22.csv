8714512,5,B00WWN4A22,"Peter Kay has appeared in very funny TV shows (Phoenix Nights, Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere) and this is no exception. If you are a fan of English comedy (and I don't mean the political garbage being churned out now by pc comedians and writers) then this is a must. It will have you laughing and the acting is excellent.",1473292800,2,323,4.311475409836065
8714513,5,B00WWN4A22,"Superb British comedy!  Almost like a work of art in showing the comedic strength of brilliant dialogue.  If you love programs like ""Gavin and Stacey"" or ""Detectorists"", you will not be disappointed here.

The entire series mainly takes place during a carpool to and from work (a supermarket) for characters John (Peter Kay, also the director) and Kayleigh (Sian Gibson, aka Sian Foulkes). Peter & Sian also share the writing credits with Paul Coleman & Tim Reid, creating some of the most aching, laugh out loud comedies television has offered.  It is impossible to describe how so much fun could be captured in such a small space (a little red Fiat to be exact).  I highly recommend you take this journey with them.  You will not regret it.",1450396800,5,742,4.7578125
