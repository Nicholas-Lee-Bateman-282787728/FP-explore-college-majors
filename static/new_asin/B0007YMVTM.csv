8054236,2,B0007YMVTM,"I was disappointed in both documentaries.  In fact I consider them less to be documentaries and more subjective conspiracy theories with little objectivity.  With little / no tie into the movie or book, the information is scrambled.  I much prefer the History Channel's dvd on the DaVinci code to this one.",1243382400,5,306,4.96078431372549
