8450644,5,B001JP667G,"Wow, I have never seen anything like this before, not of this quality!
This is NOT your old video of a fireplace, no way.
I personally love sitting in front of the fire and getting lost in the flames and some how this dvd captures the true essence.
I highly recommend it.",1225843200,,271,4.230769230769231

I produced it, so I can upload the video. In all fairness, I can not rate it, but it sure was fun to make. We filmed it on a Sony900 HDCam and used a variety of fuels to make the different colors. This is meant to be an art piece. It also warms up the room like the visuals of a fire, but we found watching the flames dance to the music mesmerizing and that the fire seemed to move to the music. Its a bit like a trance or meditation that heats you up mentally. Fire worship is part of many religions, myths and cultures. Its also just plain cool on your screen.",1225411200,,952,6.21969696969697
