7983982,2,B00008G92R,"This movie was okay, so I guess I can give it a 2 1/2 star rating.  The people on the cover have nothing to do with the movie.  It is a low budget film and you can tell.  The plot was okay.  The acting so so.  The cover makes it look like a fun comedy and it's not.  The best I can say is comparing the cover to the movie is like comparing the people in dating adds to the people one would actually meet.",1272585600,4,404,3.6941176470588237
