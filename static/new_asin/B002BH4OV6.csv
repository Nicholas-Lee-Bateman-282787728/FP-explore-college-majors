3894499,2,B002BH4OV6,"I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.

My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models, the rare trim levels, the more desirable luxury models. As an example, one promo was about the (relative) fuel economy of the Chevrolet Impala compared to it's Ford and Chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track. This is not exactly what I would call an interesting classic car commercial.

The segment on the Corvair was okay, so I gave this two-stars. Overall, to me, this wasn't worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a Dodge Polara compared to others in its class.",1331856000,,967,4.616279069767442

 I've seen other copies that are as good as watching the original ads,
 so I know it can be done. This time it wasn't!",1327190400,,182,3.891891891891892

8361372,4,B002BH4OV6,"I laugh when I read most of these customer reviews.  If you read the description -- you get exactly what is advertised.  This is a collection of vintage car commercials, promos and films.  Nothing more.  There are a ton of vintage promotional film for General Motors cars in this collection including the Corvair and Impala.  If some people spent half as much practicing reading comprehension instead of complaining -- the world would probably be a better place.",1363996800,,462,4.9480519480519485

8361374,3,B002BH4OV6,"I tend to agree with the other reviewer on this DVD.
I think the first volume of Classic Car Memories was
pretty good -- but some of the footage on Volume 2
was rough.  I do like that this volume was mostly all
car commercials, but some of them had sound or video
artifacts.

Still to the first volume if you are going to pick
this DVD up.",1337990400,,339,3.9705882352941178
8361375,4,B002BH4OV6,"I have no idea what JAG 2.0 is talking about.

His myopic view of -- if it isn't a muscle car then it's
a crappy classic car... just makes no sense.  Especially,
considering that you can already buy the ""American Muscle
Car"" series for coverage on vintage performance
cars.

This video features segments on the Chevy Corvair,
1966 Chevy Impala and a plethora of TV commercials
of various Fords, Dodges and Chevys.  I was quite
happy with the various vehicles included.",1337990400,,468,4.7407407407407405
