8633874,3,B00HNTOSAO,"An independent movie that was made on a shoestring budget by admitted amateurs. If you watch it for fun and can ignore its dilettantisness while you are having a drink, it might be worth it. The director comes across as something of a tyro.",1521244800,,240,4.4772727272727275

8633882,3,B00HNTOSAO,"Jersey-boy - Heavy metal horror headbanger Bill Zebub is nothing if not prolific in his apparent passion to provide product to all those deviant souls out there who have a hankering to view unclothed Goth chicks being molested in a variety of ways. Some of Zebub's 'work' is obviously 'satirical' in its' parody of the sexploitational horror genre (such as 'Assmonster' and ""Dolla Morte"") but other times the farcical aspects seem to be more in his 'mind' than what actually ends up on the screen. A 'blurb' on the DVD box of ""Kill The Scream Queen"" proclaims it to be a 'satire' but, in my opinion, there is little of the content or tone of this piece to substantiate that claim.

If someone wanted to present a perfect example of the term 'Gratuitous Sex & Violence' this could be the flik to choose! This is essentially a BDSM sorta exercise disguised as a 'horror parody' - but, as previously noted, the satirical elements may be mostly in Zebub's imagination in this one. There are 2 'locations' featured: one is what is likely a (real!) Goth themed stripper bar in Jersey where Zebub (playing himself!) does his 'filming & molesting', and the second is in some picturesque 'woods' where he ostensibly 'buries his victims'. The premise, as noted in the 'review', is of Zebub luring aspiring 'bimbo' horror actresses to 'act' in a simulated snuff film, but the 'snuff' is, purportedly. for 'real' and he 'murders' the girlz after 'having his way' with them.

The flik is actually broken into 'chapters' with 'titles' like: 'humiliation', 'rape', 'torture',  etc. so, in case the subtlety eludes one, Zebub makes sure the viewer knows what he's getting at. A different 'actress' is featured in each of the 'chapters' and the 'action' primarily involves the girl being tied up to a cheesy 1""x4"" x-frame while the 'director' (Zebub - often in a rubber mask) removes their clothes (generally to a topless state w/ lower lingerie intact) and torments them a bit while babbling inanely about his mock drama then he 'dispatches' them (never shown) and moves on to the next 'vignette' of misogynistic mayhem. The girlz who 'put up' with all this nonsense are fairly attractive - one might imagine that some were farmed from the pay roll of the strippers at the club where the filming took place - the stage blood flows freely - and there REALLY is NO 'redeeming social value' to any of it. Zebub seems determined to 'fill the niche' originally created by the likes of Ed Wood or Gordon Herschel Lewis, but there is a 'contrived' aspect to his cheap-o direct to video productions that lacks the naive earnestness that made the old-school schlockmeisters retro-actively 'fun'. I find that a little of Zebub goes a long way -BUT if yer basically lookin' for some lite weight B&D & T&A with a satanic heavy metal soundtrak - this cud B 4 U!",1433548800,2,2832,4.752032520325203
8633883,1,B00HNTOSAO,"There is not story, no subject, no places. A guy got two bars of wood 2 x 4,  tied three topless women to the wood one after one, then took some pictures for them and made a video, Then got another woman fully naked runs in the woods and video her running from top to bottom, that is all the movie, So save your money, and time watching this trash that Amazon lately start selling to their customers to make money. my advice; don't be a fool, save your money, save your money, and stay away from this trash.",1407542400,10,507,4.121212121212121
