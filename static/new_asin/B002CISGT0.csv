8364009,5,B002CISGT0,"If you are interested in these stories I would purchase Miracles Among Us instead.  Since I now own both I can tell you that many of the stories that are in Angels in disguise are retold in Miracles Among Us plus many, many more.  I personally love stories like this and watch them over and over again and each time even though I know the outcome...I end up with tears in my eyes. I have had a couple close call accidents in the car with my child and in both cases I do believe our angels were protecting us especially my little one.  Our angels are always with us some in human form and others supernatural in nature.",1457740800,,618,4.220338983050848

8364013,5,B002CISGT0,"Angels in Disguise was incredible and inspiring.  My faith has suffered very badly in the past few years, and these stories gave my faith a badly needed boost.  The only complaint I have is that it would have been a little easier to follow if close captioning was available.",1433030400,,274,4.571428571428571

8364015,1,B002CISGT0,No closed captioning or english subtitle in video for hard of hearing and deaf people. I was very bored of story voice I cannot hear. Don't buy season if you are deaf. This video is only for hearings. Sorry. One star.,1426118400,,217,4.317073170731708
