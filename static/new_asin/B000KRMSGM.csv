8158773,4,B000KRMSGM,"The AJ Styles-Jeff Jarrett-NWA World title match was not great but pretty good and it could have done alot better without Tito Ortiz as guest ref. The 20 man Gauntlet for the Gold was a high-flying,hard-hitting,smash-mouth,fierce showstealer. The Raven-Sean Waltman(who was subbing for Jeff Hardy)-Clockwork Orange House of Fun match was a bloody,hardcore & a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1282435200,,441,4.972972972972973

They are reviews of Hard Justice '06 when this DVD listing is for Hard Justice '05.  Could somebody please fix this as it makes for much confusion of what is actually for sale.",1220918400,,276,4.3076923076923075
8158775,4,B000KRMSGM,"Hard Justice had some pretty good matches and one moment that made it really unforgettable. I am of course talking about the fire that forced everyone to evacuate the building. However to the luck of TNa fans, the fire was put out and the ppv was allowed to continue. Meanwhile Spike Dudley fought Abyss for the first time ever, a triple threat falls count anywhere match took place between the three powerhouses, Samoa Joe, Rhyno, and Monty Brown. And Sting and Jeff Jarret fought over the NWA title with a finish that might surprise you....

Eric Young vs. Johnny Devine:

This was a good match, but halfway through was when the fire broke out. The entire arena filled with smoke and the crowd was pretty entertaining to listen to, almost as good as the chants you would hear in ECW [the real ECW, not wwecw] As the smoke cleared Eric Young got the pin with a jumping neckbreaker. 5/10 [just because we couldn't see the match for most of the time.]

After the match there was a lot of footage of firetrucks arriving, TNa stars standing around, the crowd evacuating from the building, and Don West and Mike Tenay stalling for time including a promo from Monty Brown. The fire was cleared and the ppv continued...

#1 Contendership Match for the X Division Title

Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley:

Good match between two of the best in the X Division. A back and forth battle and Kevin Nash came down to ringside in a wheelchair. These two put on a good match and the end came when Sabin kicked a chair into Shelley's face after Nash threw a chair to Shelley to help him win. Sabin then hit the cradle shock to Shelley to get the win. 8/10

Abyss vs. Spike Dudley:

I don't like the new names for the Dudley Boyz [just my own opinion] so I will call Brother Runt Spike Dudley, as everyone knows him as. This was a brawl from start to finish, and both men use their moves on the other to try and get the pin. The finish saw James Mitchell throw Abyss his back of tacks and Abyss pressed Spike's face into the tacks, then a press slam onto the tacks, followed by a black hole slam onto the tacks for the win. 8.5/10

I hate Vince for trademarking the Dudley Boyz names, but I will still call them the Dudley Boyz no matter what...

Falls Count Anywhere Match

Samoa Joe vs. Monty Brown vs. Rhyno:

This was a good match with a lot of brawling in the crowd and uses of weapons such as kendo sticks, trash cans, and trash can lids. One cool spot saw Rhyno fall through two tables near the entrance way after trying to throw Monty Brown through them! Samoa Joe got the win after throwing Monty Brown through another table off the entrance way. 9/10 [a good solid match]

Gail Kim vs. Sirelda:

This was sort of like the Beth Pheonix/Mickie James fued, a random woman showed up, then disappeared a few days later... Gail Kim is hot and can wrestle, but this match wasn't outstanding. Gail Kim got the win. 6/10

X Division Championship

Senshi [champion] vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams:

Very fast paced match, this is what TNa needs to use to challenge WWE. A lot of high moves, reversals, counters, and near falls. Petey Williams managed to use the Canadaian Destroyer on Jay Lethal but Senshi dropkicked him and got the pin instead. 8.5/10

NWA Tag Team Championships

AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels [Champions] vs. LAX:

I liked the fued between these two teams, a lot of great chain wrestling and back and forth action. Some good tag team wrestling by AJ Styles and Daniels, and Homicide and Hernandez [LAX]. Hernandez attempted the Border Toss, but AJ and Daniels threw Homicide out of the ring and both knocked down Hernandez and Daniels got the pin. 8/10

NWA World Heavyweight Championship

Jeff Jarret [champion] vs. Sting:

Okay match with a lot of interference by Scott Steiner and Christain Cage. Sting did his usual pumping up the crowd bit, and both Steiner and Cage were kicked out of standing at ringside. The finish came when Steiner ran back out with a guitar and Cage ran down with Sting's bat and took out Steiner and Jarret. However Cage turned heel and took out Sting with Jarret's guitar. Jarret got the pin. 8.5/10

Hard Justice is recommended for the Falls Count Anywhere Match, the X Division Championship, the fire moment, Abyss/Spike Dudley match, and even Cage's heel turn. Solid ppv for TNa and props for getting back on track after the fire incident.",1166745600,2,4376,4.545222929936306
