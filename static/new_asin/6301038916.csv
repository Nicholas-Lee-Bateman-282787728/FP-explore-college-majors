7809722,3,6301038916,"This was the first Judy Garland Video Biography I ever got. I received it as a gift many years ago. I got it when I was trying to research information on Garland on my early days of being a fan of hers. I learned a lot from this video. It basically gives you the HIGHLIGHTS of Garland's life.

This video pretty much just cuts to the chase of her life. Where than most biographies of Garland today by A&E and The Biography Channel don't just cut to the chase of everything. They gave you every specific detail a Garland fan would want in a 1 - 2 hour video. But this video fails to pursue that.

The only time I would recommend this to any person is if they are a NEW fan of Judy Garland. But if you are like me currently, and have been a fan of Judy for at least few years of Judy, this is HIGHLY NOT recommended to you then.",1185753600,,826,4.0

7809724,5,6301038916,"A scrapbook is, by definition, a subjective collection of memorabilia, so the appropriate title for this study of Judy Garland. Our unctuous narrator  prefaces what is to follow by stating that previous efforts have  concentrated on Judy's unhappy private life and ignored her prestigious  body of work, so the aim then is to demonstrate that they don't make `em  like Judy anymore. What does follow however will not satisfy those seeking  a definitive portrait. We see a lot of studio photos, stills, trailers for  her films with Mickey Rooney, one for Meet Me in St Louis (in black and  white!), a radio broadcast of her singing Over The Rainbow, her wardrobe  tests for Valley of the Dolls, and the Who and Look for the Silver Lining  numbers from Till the Clouds Roll By. (It amuses me to think that the  exertion of her dancing in the Who number while pregnant combined with her  pill-taking produces a Liza Minnelli). There is no footage of The Wizard of  Oz, A Star is Born is only covered by the newsreel of the opening, nothing  on The Pirate, Easter Parade, Get Happy or Summer Stock, no footage of her  concerts or TV series, and no mention of A Child is Waiting and I Could go  on Singing. A still from Judgment at Nuremburg used out of context in the  discussion of her marriage to Vincente Minnelli is particularly irkesome.  However, what redeems this video is the surviving footage from Annie Get  Your Gun that Judy was fired from  - I'm an Indian, Too and Doin' What  Comes Naturally. Indian appears the same as it did in the MGM doco When the  Lion Roars, though here the colours are blurier. Having not seen the Betty  Hutton eventual film, since it has been unavailable for years, I can only  go by the cast recordings I have heard where the number is definitely  longer. The sequence here, as in the Lion Roars, feels abbreviated. It is  said that the number was incomplete, whether due to the removal of director  Busby Berkelely or because of Judy's troubles. Either way, it does  contradict the myth that Berkeley was not serving the material well, since  it is remarkeable. Most of it is in one take and features more than 20  dancers, which would explain the length of time taken to film it. The same  thing appears to be true for Doin' What Comes Naturally, which is preceded  and followed by dialogue. Here again Berkeley has used an uninterrupted  take. This time it is more obvious that Judy is not well. She wears a wig  to disguise the fact that her hair was falling out, but despite her  condition and the fact that she did not get along with Berkeley, here is  the proof that they don't make `em like Judy anymore. Here is the essence  of Garland as performer, a showbiz avatar. The real tragedy of Garland  leaving MGM is what she may have achieved if she had been inclined to stay.  In spite of the myth that she herself perpetuated, she wanted out of her  contract, when the studio agreed to let her go. The point is made that the  evolution of her films with Rooney showed her eclipsing him, and she did  salvage her career by re-inventing herself as a live performer. But she was  always a fine actor and the performance we see as Annie Oakley shows her in  a very different light. Vincente Minnelli said that Hollywood had barely  scratched the surface with her, and this makes the footage saved for this  video all the more invaluable.",965692800,13,3377,4.545757071547421
