2382928,4,B000AA4EZC,"The rockumentary is great with cool old footage. The live footage is not as good as worldwide live, but still good. and it proves that the last studio album ""unbreakable"" includes fantastic tracks that fit directly to old classics from Blackout, Love at first sting or Animal Magnetism.",1129161600,8,286,4.979166666666667
2382929,4,B000AA4EZC,"I am a long time Scorps fan (25+ years).  I think this DVD is a must for any ""true"" Scorps fan.  Not only does it include the entire live set, professionally filmed - killer audio, from their latest ""Unbreakable"" tour, it also includes a documentary on the history of the Scorps, narrated by the band (they speak German, but it is translated/spoken in english)...very cool material for one DVD.  The live concert was recorded in Vienna, so the crowd is much tamer than a show here in the states, but no big deal...its a huge crowd.  There are certain points in the live show where it seems Klaus's voice doesn't exactly match the audio...which gives me the impression of lip-syncing, but you be the judge...you have to look close to see it.  At the end of the song ""If You Could See it Through My Eyes"" you see the drummer and bass player singing the backing vocals, but you can tell it's really Klaus's voice...again, no big deal.  If you went to one of the recent ""Unbreakable"" concets, and enjoyed it, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.  If you didn't make it to one of the recent shows, but like the new ""Unbreakable"" CD, which I feel is the best in a looooong time (IMO as good as or better than Crazy World), you'll like this DVD.",1128556800,13,1242,4.421052631578948
2382960,4,B000AA4EZC,"This is a fast paced look (sometimes just a glimpse) into how they like to look and sound, live on stage.  As a female devotee of the band, it's a great stroll down memory lane - flashbacks of concerts I had attended, songs engraved in my mind.  I had to have it for my ""collection,"" but have not taken the time to watch it more than once.",1203033600,,339,4.044776119402985
2382961,3,B000AA4EZC,"Like the title says I can see it both ways. The video is busy and they do show way too much of the drummer even when there is a guitar solo going on. Whats up with that?
A drummer should be heard and not seen for the most part unless its his time to shine. The music is good the video quality is good as well. I like the Scorpions so I can overlook the rapid video changes. Overall its good but not great. I have seen better. But I'm not completely disappointed with it.",1192492800,2,470,3.957894736842105
2382962,3,B000AA4EZC,Wow. The single star dudes don't seem to be able to buy anything they like !! Need help ? Or maybe get another life !!,1174780800,3,118,3.76
2382963,4,B000AA4EZC,"One thing I learn about reading some reviews is that is not allways the case,you have to be a fan first and then the critic,reviewers have different taste in music was it the video? was it the audio?this is an example I won't even mention the reviewer's name but this is what happened keep in mind that every reviewer deserves respect first of all,He gave Michael Schenker a low star score but he gave Madonna 5 stars so you see he wasn't a guitar player fan,in the case of this DVD I think it was a pretty good DVD for the concert the videos and the interesting interviews I kind of balance the reviews and most important to check the profiles first before you make the decision to buy the item or not!",1164240000,2,703,4.293233082706767
2382964,5,B000AA4EZC,I JUST LOVED THIS DVD. MOST CONCERT DVD ONLY FOCUS ON THE SINGERS AND GUITAR PLAYERS. I REALLY LOVE THIS ONE SINCE THEY EVEN SHOW GREAT SHOTS OF THEIR DRUMMER JAMES KOTTAK!!  HE IS THE BEST DRUMMER SINCE SLICED BREAD!  HE PUTS ON A SHOW BY HIMSELF!  ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND THE PICTURE SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT THERE IN THE FRONT ROW!  HAVE NEVER SEEN A CONCERT DVD LIKE THIS BEFORE!,1143936000,9,387,4.1891891891891895
2382965,2,B000AA4EZC,"I sell music DVDs and I have to agree with the 1 star because of the fact the camers would not stop at one person. I was so dizzy after I watched the DVD I had a migrain! if you can handle being on a boat feeling sick, go for it. By the way the sound was good.",1143676800,8,260,3.5
2382966,5,B000AA4EZC,"A masterpiece Great sound and Picture turn it up loud and enjoy a classic concert, Scorpions at their best, a must for any Rock fan you won't be dissapointed. Also contains a Rockumentary with complete history of the band from the very beginings to present line up.",1142726400,3,265,4.659574468085107
2382967,5,B000AA4EZC,"I couldn't agree more on those giving 5 stars to this DVD, perhaps amazon.com should pay more attention to those who give multiple reviews, either good or bad, and delete them.  I don't know the band members' age, but I guess they are all approximately 50, and they could still sing and play better than most of the 'rock' bands, and they are unbelievably energetic - what else could you ask for?  The audio and video are also incredibly good!",1142294400,4,443,4.525
2382968,5,B000AA4EZC,"I have never seen the Scorpions in concert, until now, I was blown away be this dvd, I own many of the cd's, but it's not the same as this dvd, so having said this< I will ad this ALL YOU KIDS OF THE SEVENTIES YOUR REALLY GOING TO LIKE THIS STUFF ALOT, SO BUT IT.

2382969,5,B000AA4EZC,"I've been waiting for  12 years  for a decent Scorpions album and they've disappointed me a lot with poppy albums. Now the legendary german band is  back with a very solid  album (Unbreakable) and a strong DVD. I don't know where this quadriple ""reviewer""  was coming from (maybe he's got used to listen to the smooth and clean sound of some new crappy  pop groups calling themselves ""metal"" - you could easily get used to them if you listen to the lousy radio stations all across America). But this is not rock music.  Good  heavy rock sounds rough and ""bad"" edition can do it only god. I like the heavier sound of this album. Or maybe the ""reviewer "" knows only ""Wind of Change"" and doesn't know that Scorpions were considered as a heavy metal  bvand in the eighties. I wish the Scorpions have included more classics and extended the show a little bit (it's only 75 minutes), but I think it's great for the price! Klaus Meine has still a great voice and Rudolf Schenker and Mathias Jabbs are still on fire! I liked the documentary (although it could be a little shorter) too. Welcome back  Scorpions to heavy music!  I wish  Amazon could screen for multiple reviews from one person (no matter  bad or good) and remove the excess of them!",1141430400,2,1239,4.502242152466367
2382990,5,B000AA4EZC,"It's blatantly obvious that the five reviews which gave this DVD one star, as well as the two-star review, were all written by THE SAME PERSON, under different screen names.  Notice that five of those six reviews contain the IDENTICAL vocabulary/spelling error of using the word ""edition"" in a sentence in which he was obviously describing the ""editing.""  Notice that all six reviews all refer to moving too quickly from one musician to the next.  Notice that all six reviews are nearly identical in length.  Notice that they were all composed within 10 days of each other, several on the very same day.  It's obviously one disgruntled fan's attempt to bring down the average rating of this DVD.  You're not fooling me.  This DVD is GREAT, and it deserves five stars.  I'll go ahead and predict you're one of those fans who refuses to accept new music by any line-up other than the ""vintage"" Scorpion line-up, so you're sabotaging their rating on Amazon.com.  You remind me of many of my fellow KISS fans who share the same closed-mindedness towards any KISS line-up other than Gene/Paul/Ace/Peter.  BUY THIS DVD!  Five stars!",1140739200,37,1126,4.873684210526315
2382991,5,B000AA4EZC,"I really liked this DVD. Even though the editing is a bit crappy, it's still a good quality DVD. This is like the second time the Scorpions actually released a normal rock version DVD other than the Crazy World one. Acoustica and Moment of Glory was not a normal rock one they were projects. I don't think we should complain. I was happy when I heard they were releasing a live concert DVD. The documentary is very long, but it goes really in depth and you see a lot of the Scorpion's footage that you've never seen before. The question is that if they have all these pro footage, why not realease them on DVD and make money?! Other than some editing mistakes, this DVD is a great buy for a fan.",1139529600,7,695,4.2727272727272725
2382992,4,B000AA4EZC,"I own both the DVDs for Acoustica and Moment of Glory.  This DVD is not as good as those two.  The film footage is not as impressive, not as well put together and the footage could have been recorded better but the horrible reviews on here are totally unfounded.  The footage still captures the raw energy of the band (the crowd isn't up to par with the show sadly) live and the sound is great (you can complain about the footage but not about the sound).  If you are Scorps fan you will like the subtle changes in the Zoo.  I have heard a number of live versions (from cds/dvds and in concert) of this Scorpions staple and I really really like this version.  Deep and Dark live also sounds great.  I would recommend this DVD to a Scorpions fan and to a metal fan.  If you are neither, then this might not be for you!",1131667200,18,817,4.1923076923076925
2382993,1,B000AA4EZC,"Although their last studio offer, UNBREAKABLE, was a pleasant surprise, this DVD lacks the quality of its counterpart CD. Edition is atrocious, cutting from musician to musician in less than a second, the whole show.",1131408000,6,216,5.2
2382994,1,B000AA4EZC,"Due to bad edition, this DVD by the greatest German band of all times is almost unwatchable. The sound is strong and crisp. What ruined it all was edition, by someone called Anna Hausing, something like that.",1131062400,5,208,4.648648648648648
2382995,1,B000AA4EZC,"I love stalwart German musicians Scorpions, but this DVD is, unfortunately, very weak. Not in terms of the songs, but in terms of the general production. The imagems are, in general, a great big blur, alternating all the time between the drummer and the rest of the band (the new bass player, Polish guy Pavel Maciwoda, is barely shown), in blinding-fast editing moves that will make you feel disgusted with the whole experience of watching this DVD.",1130803200,4,450,4.857142857142857
2382996,1,B000AA4EZC,"The best band from German of all times delivered a pedestrian package here. The extras contain only a weak doccumentary and one single bonus song.

As for the concert itself, it's not bad, but its edition is weird, done at breatktaking speed (the so-called ""MTV Style""), and that destroys a lot of the watching experience of this DVD.",1130284800,5,334,4.758620689655173
2382997,2,B000AA4EZC,"Up until now, I had never imagined Scorpions to be one of those bands that would release a bad official DVD on the market. Unfortunately, that's what we have in this DVD.

Choppy edition, a old documentary made for German TV included in the DVD. It's not a doccumentary made for the DVD.

Very weak release...",1130284800,5,309,4.5
2382998,1,B000AA4EZC,"It hurts me to tell this about a beloved band of mine, but it's the simple truth. What went wrong with this product? There are two MAJOR problems:

1) Headache-inducing edition. The sound is perfect, you can feel the band is in top notch form. The only trouble is that you can't watch them! Each frame lasts sometimes less than a second, it's awful, it's boring, you can't watch Mathhias Jabs perform a solo, you can't watch the drummer complete a drum roll. It's not Unbreakable, it's Unwatchable.

2) Simply by viewing the musician's clothes during the songs, you can see that they used footage from different shows in the same song!! This is so annoying!!

I already sold my copy of this DVD.",1130198400,3,695,4.588709677419355
2382999,4,B000AA4EZC,"I received a copy from a named company through Amazon that delivered...  However, they delivered a DVD that was great for the concert, but only in true German on the documentary side.  Oh well, if I wanted a documentary I'd watch the Discovery Channel.  The DVD Concert portion is not as good as I have seen in the past, in which I attended, while in the AF (Crazy World Tour, Berlin).  But for a band that has recently ignored the fans in the US that have bought past albums (yes vinyl) and basically put them on the map of Rock, they did not tour well.  At least we helped buy their swimming pools and nice houses, BMW's, etc in Hannover.  Besides the disregard of the US fan base, it is a pretty good DVD.  The sad truth is that I will always be a Scorpoins fan.  Rock on Matthias, Rudolf and Klaus.  And James Kottak is a great drummer, a sleeper.  Catch his beats with the band Krunk.",1129161600,7,889,4.238095238095238

8076687,5,B000AA4EZC,The Scorps have rocked for longer than the 1 star idiots have been alive. Bunch of mylie cyrus fan club members most likely! Just shut your punk asses up and turn up the volume on the scorpions,1363046400,2,193,4.243243243243243
8076688,3,B000AA4EZC,"A good representation the Scorps live show.

Although their live shows pale in comparison to the studio work (I've seen them three times live) this is a very good representation of their live show.

Excluding ""Humanity Hour 1"" (not written by the scorps, what the hell were they thinking?) I can't really think of a bad album.

If you're a fan, this DVD will be right up your alley !!",1330646400,,384,4.457142857142857

8076691,5,B000AA4EZC,Just saw the Scorpions again live in concert. I saw them in 1984 and 1987 and they sound as good today as they did back in the 80's!!

8076692,3,B000AA4EZC,thought this would be excellent...turns out to be average....wacken is better performance ....bio and extras are very nice and make this package worth getting,1232841600,,158,5.625
8076693,4,B000AA4EZC,"Although the audio quality of this DVD isn't perfect the live performance shows the energy that the Scorpions bring to the stage day in and day out.  In the final song they obviously used video clips from different shows because the drummer is shown in a different shirt over and over.  Whoever edited this show....well.......did he get paid?

The history of the Scorpions documentary is about one hour long and is a joy to view.  The only thing about the history production is the playing of music that didn't correspond with that point in history.  A very fun DVD but I would recommend Wacken Live 2006, a DVD that came out in 2007 with very good sound quality and a setlist with 26 songs including the Matthias Jabs guitar and James Kottak drum solos.",1219968000,6,754,4.597014925373134
