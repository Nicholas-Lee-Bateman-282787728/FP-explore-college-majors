7904691,4,B000006QWP,"This is a great tape, full of interesting facts and questions about history BUT, just one warning.  This is NOT the Anicent Inventions with Terry Jones. That show, I believe, was based on the book while this tape is just one episode in a series which deals with history, made by the History Channel (and A&E) and its title HAPPENS to be Anicent Inventions.  Even the cover of the VHS tape they show in the above picture is wrong. Also, this tape leaves you with more questions than answers because they also deal with lost cities and such.  In other words, they don't just deal with inventions alone and near the end of the tape kind of bounce about a lot, but still interesting. Yet, the one with Terry Jones, if you CAN GET IT would still be more interesting.",982800000,14,761,4.421428571428572
7904692,5,B000006QWP,"I saw the premiere on A&E, and then the repeat on the Discovery Channel. Absolutely fascinating!  To see what was actually invented during what time period makes this video worth seeing over and over again.",980208000,,206,4.885714285714286
7904693,2,B000006QWP,"Unfortunately I wrote my original review on the misapprehension that this video was the same one I had seen before featuring Terry Jones. It is not.
This video is interesting, but it is disorganized, featuring some inventions but more about lost cities and building techniques.
The episodes with Terry Jones(not this tape however) are one of the most informative and interesting ways to explore the ancient (and not so ancient) world. Terry Jones' narration and participation make this well worth watching. He entertains and informs, but never condescends. He is so clearly having fun that he brings the viewers along with him on a ramble of discovery. I highly recommend it, and have shown portions to my Latin students. They never fail to be enthralled. Treat yourself and get that video (not this paltry substitute) if you can.",978739200,2,830,5.021739130434782
