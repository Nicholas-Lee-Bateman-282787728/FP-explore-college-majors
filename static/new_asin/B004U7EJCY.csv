So,It's 2012 and the elections are coming up and some primaries already happened for the Republicans with nobody clearly in the lead ?

JP Ritter and FireFuel release this mockbuster of political films and we wonder,Why not make it  `REED 2012',Main title character should be out on parole by now and his goals are probably more refined and focused.

Showing barely distorted versions of faux analysts, What with RUSH LIMBAUGH foundering Again, O'Reilly and Huffington really get scalded by REED film-makers.

The timing of `Amazon' release before June and November makes the public actually think about their realities in voting process.

Lots on extras on the disc and hint of Ritter's 2012 feature OCCUPIERS!",1331683200,,747,5.183333333333334
