8481148,4,B005OAEWYQ,"I loved this show as a kid & I think it's the reason I love backpacking & camping in wilderness now. There is some great footage here, although if you do you homework on Stouffer there are some ethical and representational issues in some of his tactics. I'll let you do your own research & decide for yourself on these issues. Doesn't break the deal for me. The film quality is not remastered but it is better than old VHS. It's pretty much like just watching it on TV (I mean like it was to watch it on TV in the 80s/90s and people who've grown up seeing only HD may not understand what this means and give the quality a bad review based on lack of this understanding. There is much good footage, but a lot of it is recycled many times in many episodes. Don't expect all original footage with each episode & if you do a marathon this recycling becomes more obvious. Another thing is that some episodes and narration are just plain corny & silly without much quality footage scenes to make up for it (""Wacky"" TV had a popular run as a genre in the late 80s/early 90s if you remember). Apart from these issues I'm really happy to relive the awe I had of wilderness & wildlife from this show as a kid & I hope to share it with some kids today to help teach them that there's a lot of wonders out there in Wild America!",1365724800,3,1316,4.18503937007874
8481149,5,B005OAEWYQ,"I watched many of these programs on PBS when they were new, but they're just as good now as they were then.  For anyone who loves wildlife and the outdoors, they'll be facinated with the scenery and photography as well as the insight into the lives of our North American animals.  I also feel this series is a must for kids.  We bring them up with elephants, pandas, giraffes and zebras but neglect the aniimals in their own back yard.  My granddaughter loves the shows and, thanks to this set, we have Wild Americathons.....bowl of popcorn and all.",1363824000,2,549,4.571428571428571
