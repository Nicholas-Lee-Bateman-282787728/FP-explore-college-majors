2690388,5,B000KGH00C,"Murder She Wrote #5 - the shows are solid, entertaining, well written, well produced.  Angela delivers a quality performance as do her guest actors.  I look forward to my trips to Cabot Cove... a time to escape and just relax and get caught up in a good story.  Waiting for Season Six!",1173312000,,285,4.4423076923076925
2690389,5,B000KGH00C,"I highly recommend the complete 5th season for all ""Murder She Wrote"" fans. My 10 yr old can't wait until each season has been released. We enjoy watching them together and guessing who done it.",1173312000,,194,4.571428571428571
2690390,5,B000KGH00C,"How does one review something that he is as familiar with as his face in the morning mirror? While I never really watched ""Murder She Wrote"" much when it was the anchor of CBS's Sunday evening lineup, I became a totally addicted fan when I watched it in syndication during an extensive recovery period after a severe accident. Then, I found an excellent book about the series (The Unofficial Murder She Wrote Casebook by James Robert Parish)that outlined every episode and provided just about everything a true fan would want. So, I took the logical next step and recorded every episode, all 261 of them. My problem was, that VHS tape deteriorates with use and age, and my wife and I watched them so much that the loss of clarity and color became very evident. So, it was with real excitement that we anticipated the release of each season on DVD, hopefully remastered and including all the scenes removed for the extra commercials demanded by syndication.

Angela Lansbury has become our ""favorite aunt"", dependable ""Aunt Jess"" in her character ""Jesica Fletcher"", a bright, inquisitive, somewhat irritating older woman who manages to bring murder and mayhem to the most unexpected places and circumstances. When Jessica Fletcher shows up, someone's gonna die! She makes ""Typhoid Mary"" look like a rank amateur. But, even though the plots may get a bit tired, and the character a bit predictable, she will always be our first love among fictional problem solvers.

My purpose in writing this review is to look at the package and product. That the content of the discs is first rate is a given. The stories are mostly timeless, and the viewer can always pick up something new and unexpected, no matter how many times the episode has been seen. This set, however, brings back the quality and clarity that goes way beyond what we saw on the small screen starting in September 1984 with the ""Murder of Sherlock Holmes"" to the depressing last episode, ""Death by Demographics"" on that sad night in May of 1996. As near as I can tell, the original scenes have been restored, and the quality goes far beyond what was possible to determine in 1984. The packaging is crisp and clean, and the sets display well together on a shelf.

Jessica Fletcher may be gone, and the community of friends and family that surrounded her has departed with her; but this set, it's predecessors and successors, will continue to keep her alive and meddling for a long time. Now, all we need is for the 'made for TV' movies produced for CBS over the past 10 years to be released as 'stand alone' programs on DVD. Until then, I can't wait for the next season!",1173312000,6,2628,4.721132897603486
2690391,5,B000KGH00C,"good quality dvd's.  previous dvd's were double sided and there were several bad spots in the collection to date.  seems to be a trait of the double sided dvd's only.  this set was single sided, so i guess they got enough negative feedback to correct it this time.",1172966400,4,264,4.458333333333333

2690394,5,B000KGH00C,"Absolutely love all the seasons of Murder She Wrote. They are relaxing and interesting to watch before bed. In the Fifth Season Jessica (Angela Lansbury) pretends to be other people several times, including a gambling fluezy and an eccentric wealthy hypochondriac, which is totally out of character and hilarious to watch. I was excited to see a young Megan Mullaley (Karen from Will & Grace) guest starring in an episode and Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's daughter Lucie Arnaz in another. Im only 23 but have always been a huge fan of Lucille ball so it was cool seeing her daughter acting. If you liked watching Murder She Wrote when it was originally aired or any of the reruns, buy this- you will enjoy it.",1170720000,3,709,4.68

2690396,5,B000KGH00C,"I am excited that the series is being released more regular than in the past. Also, the addition of only have a one sided disc has made a huge difference in the discs being played on my DVD player. In the past, I know that many people complained of players not being able to play the double sided disc. That being said I think that the show just continues to get better. I thought that this season in particular rocks. Angela Lansbury continues to be awesome as JB Fletcher. You must be a fan or you would not want info on season 5.",1168905600,30,532,4.174757281553398

2690409,5,B000KGH00C,"The best part of this season was when Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) went undercover, playing another character(s).  If she had done more of this, the series would have improved greatly.  Instead, its just more of the same, which is considerable, due entirely to Lansbury cunning portrayal of writer Fletcher.",1503532800,,313,5.36734693877551

2690587,5,B000KGH00C,"I remember back in the day were you didn't need cable to catch great shows. The tube was dominated by Simon & Simon, Magnum P.I. and this hit. Murder She Wrote lasted 12 seasons and season # 5 is one of the best. If you like show like the ones I just mentioned you will like this hit. This is no C.S.I. but it does get your detective skills going. This show gets the brain going by trying to see who is responsible for the crime. Who says you can't learn from TV? I would recommend this show for anyone who loves detective shows or police drama. I would also recommend this to anyone willing to get away from todays reality TV crap a try getting back to some real TV and acting :).

2690641,5,B000KGH00C,"My grandmother is 90 years old and is in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease.  Nevertheless, she is still able to enjoy watching Murder, She Wrote!

Up until recently, I had never watched an episode of Murder, She Wrote.  This is mainly because I don't enjoy whodunit murder mysteries, so I never had any interest in watching the show.  But recently I have been spending a lot of time with my grandmother.  She is in a stage of Alzheimer's disease where she really can't, for safety reasons, be left alone.
Although I am still a familiar face to her, she no longer realizes that I am her grandchild.

Most days she usually does okay.  But then there are days where she becomes worried that she needs to get to her girls.  She is referring to her four daughters (my mother and three aunts), and she worries that they don't know where she is.

Fortunately, no matter how bad things get with my grandmother, an episode of `Murder, She Wrote' always brings happiness to her.  Although she can't follow the plots in most TV programs, she seems able to understand, without any problems, the 'Murder She Wrote' plots.

I now understand why this program is so popular with the elderly.  It was written specifically for people who are no longer in possession of all of their faculties.  The stories and characters in MSW are all elemental type ideas that don't require complex thinking.  This explains why Alzheimer patients are able to understand and enjoy the episodes.  To give you an idea of the elemental type things that make up an MSW episode, here is a brief list of recurring ideas that might come up in an average episode of MSW:  suspicious looking character, a crime was committed, a threat was made, a lot of money might be involved, Cabot Cove, Jessica Fletcher smells a rat, armed and dangerous men/thugs, escape, Jessica Fletcher writes murder mystery novels, an arrest is made, Jessica Fletcher is trustworthy.

The creators of Murder She Wrote have also cleverly created situations in the show that will stroke the ego of an elderly person by making the elderly person feel smart.  For example, there is a scene where Jessica Fletcher is studying a crime scene and she is re-creating the possible crime scenario in her mind.  In an exaggerated slow motion style, she imagines that she is pointing a gun and firing, just like the bad guy may have done.  So without a word being spoken by JB Fletcher, it can be figured out by an elderly viewer that Fletcher is trying to re-create the crime scenario in her head as a means for possibly solving the case.  This may seem like a small thing.  But anything that can make an Alzheimer patient feel smart has got to be a good thing.

Although I do not personally enjoy watching Murder She Wrote, I now appreciate the role that it can play in the life of an elderly person.  As television art, Murder She Wrote is a pioneering effort in the area of Alzheimer's care.

Update:  I hadn't watched all of the episodes in season 5 when I wrote the above review.  After watching a few more of the episodes, I have to say that some of the episodes are not suitable for children under the age of 18.  In at least 1 of the episodes, the male guest star offers to share his bed with JB Fletcher.  And in another episode, Fletcher dresses up as a bimbo and hangs out in a tavern.  In the last episode that I watched, Fletcher used a four-letter cuss word.  This means that MSW is not as wholesome as we have been led to believe.  But in fairness, the show was made for the elderly, not for children.  So my five star rating stands.  Just make sure to put the kids to bed before you pop in an episode of Murder, She Wrote.",1297814400,2,3666,4.496217851739789

They put a large price on them and give us inferior product.

Season five of ""Murder She Wrote"" is just more of the same. The only major change between this seasons and the ones before it is that Sheriff Amos Tupper (Tom Bosley) has ""left"" Cabot Cove and has been replaced by Sheriff Mort Metzger (Ron Masak) (Bosley actually left to star in his own mystery series, ""The Father Dowling Mysteries"", which is also likely to appeal to ""Murder She Wrote"" fans, although is not currently available on DVD). Although Amos is sorely missed, Sheriff Metzger does grow on you and by the end of the season, I found that I quite liked him. His outburst in the second last episode is absolutely hilarious.

I have faithfully followed all the seasons, and Season Five [1988-89] is as entertaining as ever. I have to say that though I love all the locations for the stories, my favorite is Cabot Cove, Maine and I just adore the quirky townspeople and the scandals around them!

In Season Five, we have some noted guest stars such as Maxwell Caulfield, John Rhys-Davies, Emma Samms, Bo Svenson, Erin Gray, etc. With such talents abounding in each episode, its no wonder that watching this series is such a pleasure! The stories are creative and well-written, with a cohesive plotline and of course, stellar acting.

Of course, the regulars are a hoot to watch as well! Angela Lansbury is flawless in her role as super sleuth J.B. Fletcher, and there are of course  William Windom as Dr Seth Hazlitt, Richard Paul as mayor Sam Booth, Jerry Orbach as PI Harry McGraw etc. Tom Bosley's role as Sheriff Amos Tupper is replaced by Ron Masak, playing Sheriff Mort Metzger. It doesn't take one too long to warm up to Sheriff Metzger as played by Ron Masak. He is the perfect foil to J.B. Fletcher, and I just love watching the comical expressions on his face as Jessica stumps him again and again on cases they work on together!

Angela Lansbury s such a talented actress and continues to amaze till today [at 82!]. What I love most about her portrayal of J.B. Fletcher is that she plays a strong, intelligent, and attractive middle-aged lady [such roles are so scarce in Hollywood], and managed to entertain audiences for 12 years in her most-famous screen role!

2690662,4,B000KGH00C,"Jessica Fletcher continues to solve more baffling crimes on the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"". And while the fifth season is a good one, it's not as great as the first four seasons. For me most of the episodes come off as just good, not great. Though season five does provide a couple of great episodes, as well as a few episodes that I felt were a little dull. Still, the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" gets a thumbs up from me.

Angela Lansbury once again is the whole show here, and gets good support from a few re-occurring co-stars as well as an impressive guest star list. William Windom returns for a couple of episodes as Cabot Cove doctor Seth Hazlitt, and Ron Masak joins the cast as new Cabot Cove sheriff Mort Metzger (replacing Amos Tupper). Season five guest stars include: Jamie Farr (""M*A*S*H""), Emma Samms (""General Hospital""), Hoyt Axton (""Gremlins""), Barbara Bain (""Mission Impossible""), Megan Mullally (""Will & Grace""), Barbara Bosson (""Hill Street Blues""), Richard Roundtree (""Shaft""), Bill Macy (""Maude""), Conchata Ferrell (""Two and a Half Men""), Mason Adams (""Lou Grant""), Shirley Knight (""As Good As It Gets""), Dee Wallace (""E.T.""), E.G. Marshall (""The Defenders""), Elizabeth Ashley (""Evening Shade""), Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order""), Robert Mandan (""Soap""), and Shelley Fabares (""Coach"").

My favorite episodes from season five are: ""Mr. Penroy's Vacation"", ""Snow White, Blood Red"", ""Something Borrowed, Someone Blue"", ""Weave a Tangled Web"", ""From Russia...With Blood"", ""Trevor Hudson's Legacy"", ""Three Strikes, You're Out"", and ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall"" (Parts 1 & 2).

Even though the fifth season of ""Murder, She Wrote"" isn't in the same league as seasons one through four, it wasn't the start of a major decline in the greatness of the show.

2690685,5,B000KGH00C,"Murder She Wrote with Angela Lansbury as the heroine,was one of my favorite shows when it was on TV.When I found out I could buy my own collection, I leapt at the chance. The DVDs are clear and sharp,the video and audio superb - even better than the series - probably because of technology. Angela solved a murder(maybe 2) using deductive reasoning in her sleuthing. She didn't need massive events of gun shooting nor the gore of many movies/TV series have today,just old-fashioned detective work.",1173312000,,497,4.858823529411764
