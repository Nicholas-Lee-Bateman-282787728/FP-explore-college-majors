8315845,4,B001KQFANU,"The best thing about debutant director Navdeep Singh's oddly entitled ""Manorama Six Feet Under"" is the sand-swept Rajasthani ambience. Once, there was the grandiloquent Rajasthan of J.P. Dutta's cinema and now there's the telltale, accusing, culpable and guilt-laden Rajasthan of Singh's cinema where crime coalesces into grime to create a kind of brackish brittle but sturdy concoction that Quentin Tarantino would approve of and Alfred Hitchcock would find hard to recognise.",1301356800,,477,5.732394366197183
8315846,5,B001KQFANU,"It was a very interesting and absorbing mystery, with lots of twists and turns.  The acting was excellent.  We especially enjoyed watching the scenery of the area around Jaipur, and the settings seemed very genuine(ie. what the inside of their houses looked like).  It was long at 2.5 hours, but even my husband wanted to watch the whole movie, and he's not a fan of the typical Bollywood-film.

This was the first non-singing/dancing Indian movie I've ever seen, which makes it relatively unique, but I'm going to look into seeing if there are more movies like this out there!",1280880000,,577,4.797979797979798
