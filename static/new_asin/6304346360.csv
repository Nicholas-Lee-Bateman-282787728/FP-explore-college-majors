7868392,2,6304346360,"I'm certain that the script for Scorpion Spring reads like the tantalizing twisted misadventures of two guys who meet on the road. A very intriguing concept - especially for a fan of 'road pictures' like myself.

But it plays as a lackluster, flat, and unsatisfying ninety-minutes of film. So much potential that fails to deliver. Which, ironically, is a plotline in the flick itself.

There are moments that this thing could've really taken off. In fact, I fully expected them. With actors like Alfred Molina, Esai Morales and the always enjoyable Ruben Blades - this should have been a slam dunk. But as soon as a potential apex of drama builds - it gets dropped off. Time and time again. Like some guy who enjoys telling jokes then repeatedly forgets the punchlines. In Scorpion Spring, we're left with a bunch of jokes with no punchlines - none. Even the ""gimmes"" are pissed away or not even explained.

Example: The final scene leaves one of the main characters without a resolution, so the audience never learns what eventually happens to her! Film School 101 - unless you're intentionally shooting for befuddlement and confusion, a.k.a. The European Ending, then have a resolution for the main characters.

This Brian Cox (not the amazing English actor) is not a director of note for a reason.

The most interesting aspect of this project is asking yourself how Director Cox got Matthew McConaughey to do a small bit part in his film.

Unfulfilling and sadly uninteresting - because I really wanted this to work.

7868393,3,6304346360,"Watching this movie was a pleasant change from the far too common sex, violence and nudity that seems to be in all of todays movies. This movie can be watched by the entire family without having to make the little ones cover their eyes.
The movie is about a mexican drug dealer who comes into the Country with drugs and a female alien. It covers their journey and troubles with other drug dealers, border patrol and other law makers.
This movie is not the greatest, but it has great actors who portray their characters well.",985651200,2,524,4.526315789473684
7868394,1,6304346360,I did not like the movie. It was long and had no plot. It is hard to keep up with the subtittels. A good thing however is you could never Guess who was on what side. So you had to finish the movie to find that out. Matthew McConaghey Did not show up untill the very end so Matthew McConaghey fans will be disapointed. The movie did not pull together untill the very end. If you want a movie were you don't have to think to hard this is it.,982886400,2,439,3.888888888888889
