8730617,4,B014G08QFK,The first two seasons were not filmed well and the subtitles were not completely visible.  But the other four seasons were upgraded and I totally enjoyed this entire series.  It is immensely educational.  Some of the characters actually lived and were in charge of building of the Continental Railroad.  There is much to learn from this series about American History.  I highly recommend it.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the first two seasons were not filmed well.,1484956800,,486,4.795180722891566
