8580070,3,B00CBW646E,"This is a low budget film about filming a low budget film in an asylum, something that has been done before and more importantly...better. This is not a found footage film, which was what I expected and that is a plus. The asylum has been shut down for only six years, after the director killed himself. It looks old because of pipes breaking causing water damage.

This asylum used experimental water on the patients as part of the government's MKULTRA project. The film takes a long time to build all the characters on the set. It does so in different fashions from dinner conversation to the blond actress (Rebecca Whitehurst) being told, ""They're stage directions. You don't read them.""
There are little tidbits in the dialouge to indicate some level of clever writing. The action builds slow, in fact a little too slow as the first snuffing doesn't happen until 36 minutes into the film. No opening hook with a ""6 hours earlier"" following the credits.

The film seems to center on Chris the writer (Andy Rudick) and Beth the grip (Victoria Nugent) who in a geeky way like each other but both being too shy to make a move. There is some minor internal conflict, conflict which escalates as the players get exposed to the water. It is just a question as to who becomes the killers and who becomes the ""kill-ees.""

I thought the scenes were done well. The acting was fairly decent. The film just couldn't put it together and hold your interest. The characters and plot didn't have any hook. Might work as a rental. Not a keeper.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. No nudity, just Rebecca Whitehurst ""side breast""",1402185600,,1613,4.669014084507042
