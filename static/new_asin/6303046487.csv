537038,3,6303046487,"I don't see what all the fuss is about, this film seems to tepid, and too dull for my tastes. If im not mistaken , Terence Fisher ""Hated"" doing ""science fiction"" films, and he only churned one out if he needed the money. And this one is no exception, a formula-bound fantasy story which centers around creatures who the suck the bone matter from the human anatomy. Charming. The only thing going for the film, besides Peter Cushing's exellence as an acotor, is Fisher's flair for dramatic camera placement, at the same time perfectly situating his actors in each frame--it's a lesson in framing,. But thats about it, Fisher just seems to be doing a competent job, he's clearly not intrested, just in it to make a quick buck, and I don't blame him, with the material he was given here--and to contrast this film with his work yet to come is....well it's scary. Such masterwork's such as his masterful touching and most oneiric Frankenstein Created Woman(1967).....his tour de force The Devil Rides Out(1968). and his most peronal masterpiece ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed(1969)""...can this be the same guy? Naw can't be......well it is....he just hated science fiction period!  So Fisher fans,be gone!,Your better off again watching his masterpiece ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed  for the 10,000 time! But if your curious, it might be worth a look, just to note some visual flair of the master, but nothing else.

537039,5,6303046487,"Island of Terror is one of those films that only seems to improve with each viewing.  The first time I saw this film, I fell in love with it!  I mean, what's not to love?  Peter Cushing versus .... ....... beasties created in a laboratory in an effort to wipe out cancer.
Peter Cushing, Edward Judd and Carole Gray star in this shocker from Planet Pictures.  It's directed by long-time Hammer director, Terence Fisher and with Cushing in the cast, it definitely has a *Hammer* feel to it.  It's a modern day setting about experiments conducted on an island off the Irish coast that goes horribly wrong....rather than creating the possible cure for cancer, the experiments give birth instead to creatures that have an unsatiable appetite for human bone!  Cushing, Judd and Gray have come to the island in an effort to see what is causing the strange deaths and in the end, find themselves fighting for their very lives!",981504000,4,918,4.70625
537040,4,6303046487,"I saw this movie as a child and couldn't sleep for a week.  It wasn't uncommon to catch this movie during the evening or late show in the late 60s and early 70s.  Unfortunately, the versions I'd watched as a child wre  often brutally edited by the local television station.  I'd searched -  since the arrival of videocassettes - for a copy of this movie.  When I  finally tracked down a copy a few years ago, I was almost reluctant to  watch it.  I'd enjoyed the feature so much as a child, I was afraid - as an  adult - I'd find it silly and contrived.  Not at all.  I enjoyed it just as  much as I had all those years ago.  Watching the video provided me with the  first opportunity to view the film in its entirety.  It was great!  The  video release also features the original trailer.  Island Of Terror is a  tale set on a remote Irish isle in which experimentation into a cure for  cancer  results in a deadly new organism which feeds on bone.  Peter  Cushing and Edward Judd deliver believable performances and the writing is  better - certainly no worse - than similar movies of its era.  I have read  criticism of the special effects.  Indeed, they pale in comparison to  effects we see today, but considering when the feature was made, I think  they hold up well.  In a shocking scene, one of the ""Silicates""  grabs Cushing by the wrist and Judd must choose between the limb and his  friend's life.  The result is bloody and spectacular.  Okay - I will  concede that the sound of a straw rattling in a milkshake cup when the  creatures are ""sucking"" the bones from their latest victim is  cheesy, but that's a minor flaw.  This is a fun and fast paced thriller and  while the special effects may not always be spectacular, the acting and  storyline make this a terrific film.",949622400,18,1785,4.369230769230769
537157,5,6303046487,"A mid '60s Horror fest starring the late great Peter Cushing. For the most part, I really like this movie and it's story. It's dated, but don't let that stop you from seeing this. The plot is during an experiment to find a cure for Cancer, a few scientists create terrible ""creatures"" that escape and attack anything in their path. The creatures are after the bones in the bodies they attack. Animals and humans alike are the victims. The Island is in danger of attack from these vile things and the humans that are left on it must fight for their very survival. Peter Cushing's character and his colleague doctor, must go through the notes from the scientists that created these horrific creatures to find a way to stop them before it's too late.

The transfer looks pretty good here on Blu-ray. Now, for the time this was made, it is probably the best looking transfer to date. I haven't owned a copy of this before, but almost everything I own is nearly Blu-ray or digital now. SCREAM factory did a great job on the overall package and special features.
Special Features a minimal, but it's great to see them here anyway.

I have seen this film many times. The sound of the creatures eating and crushing bones is creepy. The story is very good and I know the creatures, when they show them, are sort of like snake/turtle creatures, but it's a good film and I highly recommend it.
Great suspense and not bad for children, if you want to show them a scary movie without all the cursing, blood, and other remarks so prevalent in today's films.

537294,5,6303046487,"BOTTOM LINE: A terrific little sci-fi tinged chiller from England. Thankfully, this particular R1 version is COMPLETE, including the gore-ish hatchet sequence, often cut (ha!) from US prints. The movie gets a nice transfer to hi-def Blu-ray courtesy of camp & cult-obsessed crew at Shout! Factory. ISLAND OF TERROR is a lot of old-school fun and comes highly recommended. Movie: 5 STARS, Blu-ray: 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A small team of scientists working in isolation on a tiny island off the coast of Ireland accidentally create a new, aggressive & decidedly deadly silicon-based lifeform, a byproduct of their cancer research. Soon, local islanders & unwitting wildlife alike start turning up dead in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable. For, you see, the blobby, slithery ""Silicates"" subsist on calcium; using thier single tentacle to inject victims with an enzyme that dissolves all bone tissue, which is then sucked out through the wound. Without a skeleton to support their internal organs, the victims' bodies are reduced to suffocating sacks of flaccid flesh. Two renowned British doctors are called in to investigate the bizarre deaths and soon find themselves unwittingly battling not only the killer critters but also the local farmers who are near panic as their friends & families are mercilessly slaughtered by the ever multiplying army of freakish frights. Can our brave Brit heroes devise a method of stopping the slimy skeleton-slurping slugs before everyone has been reduced to mushy meatsacks???

THOUGHTS: A fantastic little chiller from independent studio Planet Film Productions, 1966's ISLAND OF TERROR has all the earmarks of a Hammer film, thanks to its use of several regular Hammer crewmembers & actors. Peter Cushing is his usual unflappable self as the esteemed Dr. Brian Stanley, while no-nonsense Edward Judd plays irascible bone specialist doctor David West. These two make a great team as they attempt to figure out exactly what's going on. The lovely Carole Gray plays Toni Merrill, Dr. West's latest fling, who insists on following the pair to the island, unaware of the horrific nightmare which awaits them. Later, in addition to launching a plan to kill the beasties, the trio must try to calm the rapidly-panicking villagers and keep them gathered at the town hall building, instead of running hysterically into the wilderness in a fruitless attempt to flee the advancing horde of calcium-hungry creatures. The Silicates are quite memorable, resembling vaguely star-shaped amoeba-esque lumps, with one squid-like tentacle. The things divide like huge cells, each reproducing a second being every six hours, (or even quicker after devouring a hapless human or animal). The F/X are crude, but nonetheless effective, as the detestable whatchamacallits are wisely kept mostly in the shadows, increasing their creepiness as they stalk their prey, (aided by some eerie sound effects, courtesy of regular Gerry Anderson 'SuperMarionation' composer & sound bite creator, Barry Gray). The boneless body F/X might seem laughable by today's standards, but it's the idea of what they represent that gives you the willies. Though dated and obvious, this movie still manages to serve up a decent amount of uneasiness, dread and genuine scares.

THE BLU-RAY: A nice effort from the gang at Shout! Factory. The transfer, (reportedly taken direct from the film's original interpositive elements), is clean, clear and mercifully devoid of dirt, debris and scratches. Focus is sharp and there's little in the way of artifacting, pixelation, edge enhancement or crush (video noise). The audio is similarly solid, with no warbling, drop-outs, pops or hissing. Sound mix is level and strong. Bonus features include a full-length audio commentary track with film historian Dr. Robert J. Kiss & Rick Pruitt which I found both informative and amusing. There's also a brief promotional photo gallery and a copy of the film's theatrical trailer. The slipcase insert is also reversible.",1500681600,9,4018,5.334384858044164
537295,4,6303046487,"A beautiful Blu-ray transfer, with colors that really pop in some scenes! A wonderful cast features Peter Cushing, Edward Judd, Carole Gray, Eddie Byrne & Sam Kydd, all turning in solid performances. Directed by Terence Fisher, on loan from Hammer. All in all, an entertaining little sci-fi thriller!",1498953600,4,300,5.270833333333333
537296,4,6303046487,"The four-star rating isn't because Island of Terror is that good. It's because it's so bad--that it's good, chock full of requisite cheezy rubber monsters, thespians who stoically deliver genuinely bad dialogue with completely straight faces and a plot that challenges the viewer not to hurl choice one-liners at the screen. My admiration has grown for actors Edward Judd, Peter Cushing and really the entire cast who managed to sell every ridiculous bit of dialogue with genuine conviction. Terence Fisher directed the film with lots energy--as if pushing cast and crew to get on with it, so as not embarrass themselves any longer than needed.

Thanks to the efforts of Shout Factory the Blu-ray disc is superbly encoded with crisp 1920x1080 resolution that even allows you to spot the wires used to wrangle the tentacles of the rubbery creatures who terrorize the island. I first saw Island of Terror years ago at the old Gemini Twin in Dallas but I didn't recall the film being so absurdly entertaining. If you want to have your own Mystery Science Theater Movie night, I recommend Island of Terror, a generous helping of sci-fi movie cheese.",1498089600,4,1145,4.963541666666667

You would have to watch the SPARTACUS restoration to see any thing better. While I understand nostalgia as well as the next guy, it is incomprehensible why they would have one of the commentators explain what a drive-in is. I worked in one, kid. The cover art is horrendous, with no pains taken to even show Peter Cushing. Why settle for that when you can show Edward Judd twice. Aside from Dr. Robert J.Kiss and his insatiable desire to explain the history of British vehicles, this disc is wonderful. Get the popcorn ready.",1497916800,3,662,4.525
537299,4,6303046487,"A surprisingly strong horror/science fiction thriller, Terence Fisher (""Horror of Dracula"", ""Curse of Frankenstein"", ""Brides of Dracula"") helms this under appreciated low budget gem.

Dr. Brian Stanley (Peter Cushing) and Dr. David West (Edward Judd) head to remote island to find out what is killing the local residents by eating all their bones leaving behind the bodies of their victims.

Many of the horror/science fiction thrillers of the 60's don't hold up for a variety of reasons but Fisher's films all have something to recommend them and here the production holds together remarkably well given when it was produced. Featuring two terrific performances by Cushing and Judd (""First Men in the Moon""), ""Island of Terror"" will be a cool gem for those who enjoy Hammer films (this wasn't a Hammer production but with Cushing and Fisher on board it might as well have been).

I'm not sure who provided the this sharp looking transfer of the film but the colors are bolder, detail sharper than the UK release of the film on Blu-ray. Part of that is a higher bit rate but the other part has to do with the choices made during the transfer process itself. Shout Factory (under their horror Scream imprint) do a terrific job here. I don't know if the 1.78:1 aspect ratio is correct but it looks quite good here. The mono soundtrack sounds quite nice with a DTS-HD presentation. Yes, the same limitations that applied to the original DVD and recently released UK Blu-ray.

I should note that this version features the film unedited which includes some gore that was cut from the original exhibition of the UK print (it was in tact on the original U.S. release).

Shout also provide some nice special features (they could just as easily given this a no frills release). The audio commentary by Dr. Robert J. Kiss and actor/blogger Rick Pruitt (he isn't featured in the film and I'm not familiar with his blog) provides an interesting discussion on the production of the film. Shout also presents a still gallery and the theatrical trailer.",1497916800,8,2038,4.861671469740634

Anyone who's seen ""Fiend without a Face"" -- a true horror classic -- will immediately recognize the thematic and structural similarities -- no, make that identities -- between the films. A scientist accidentally creates a monster that breaks loose and starts killing people -- in one case by eating their brains, in the other by dissolving their bones. The climaxes are the same, with people hunkered down, waiting for the monsters to break in. It's impossible to believe ""Island of Terror"" wasn't at least unconsciously influenced by ""Fiend without a Face"".

Let's be honest... The crawling brains in ""Fiend"" are infinitely more frightening than the ""turtles with tentacles"" in ""Island"".

The dialog never rises above stilted exposition, and the ""science"" is even worse. (Strontium is taken up by the bones over a period of time -- not in just a few minutes.) The characters are so stupid they don't see the monsters a few feet away. And when a monster drops from the ceiling or a tree onto a victim (it's never explained how they climb trees or walls), the struggle with the creature is only slightly less ludicrous than Bela Lugosi fighting a rubber octopus.

It's not even stupid in a ""fun"" way. It's just plain stupid, the product of writers who have no idea how to create an original, clever story.",1431216000,,1466,4.852

Unfortunately, as the movie itself starts, one notices that something is a bit off about the image.  In fact, skin tones are often tinted toward yellow, especially when the subject is on the left side of the screen.  I'm not sure whether or not this is due to fading or a faulty transfer/color correction.  At first, I was so upset and distracted by this problem (which runs throughout the length of the film) that I didn't enjoy the movie much.  Upon second screening, I was more forgiving and got more into the movie itself.  There are very few blemishes to the print itself. The sound is fine.

Reviews on the UK Amazon site mention nothing about this problem, so perhaps it is unique to my setup, although other films I have don't exhibit such color cast issues.

This is really a great film, and if you're a fan, the blu ray is worth having.  Extras are sparse: a booklet with an essay and interview with producer Richard Gordon, a faded trailer, and still image gallery.  Although it's a UK release, the blu ray is region free (A,B,C).  This is probably the only shot for this film on blu ray.  Universal owns the North American rights and they didn't even bother to release it on DVD, much less any hope for a blu ray.  They did issue it on VHS and the print used for that was almost perfect, so I know they hold very good elements on this title.  Too bad their elements weren't available for this U.K. release.

By the way, more people might consider this title if Amazon listed it under its real title, ISLAND OF TERROR, not ISL & OF TERROR!!",1415232000,15,1712,4.439102564102564

Reclusive oncologist Dr. Lawrence Phillips is on the verge of curing cancer. He and his assistants have set up shop on the remote Petrie's Island, somewhere off the coast of Ireland, an island with no working phones, a weekly visit by a supply ship, and only one cop. Phillips' experiment is reaching a head, when, suddenly, something goes wrong. There is a flash of red light, and some breaking glass and we smash cut to the opening credits...

Island of Terror!

The night of the ill-fated experiment, That night, local farmer Ian Bellows is walking home through the woods when he hears a strange, electronic warbling noise coming from inside a cave. He decides to investigate. Bad move, Ian.

When Ian doesn't return home, his wife contacts Constable John Harris, the aforementioned only cop, who finds the waylaid farmer in the cave after searching the forest. But his corpse is in such a state that Harris rushes to get Reginald Landers, the island's doctor. An examination of Ian's corpse confirms Landers' worst fears; the dead man is completely boneless! At his wit's end, Landers heads to the mainland to see Dr. Brian Stanley in London. Unfortunately, although Stanley is Britain's foremost pathologist he has never heard of a disease that dissolves human bone.

Undaunted, Stanley takes Landers in turn to see hotshot young osteopath David West, currently attempting to talk his way into the pants of Toni Merrill, a former patient of his. Thoroughly cockblocked by Stanley and Landers, West is confounded by the tale of a boneless corpse, but agrees to return to Petrie's Island with the other two doctors. Toni, who has a rich father, offers the use of daddy's private helicopter with which to fly to the island, provided the three men let her tag along. Upon arrival however, Toni's father requires the chopper for some last-minute business. The pilot is forced to drop the four people off at the island and then fly away, leaving them effectively stranded until he can return. Uh-oh.

The doctors set immediately to work. They discover Ian was injected with a new enzyme that dissolves calcium phosphate, but can't figure out what produces it. The local clinic doesn't provide sophisticated enough equipment, so Landers suggests they go and see Dr. Phillips, as Phillips' laboratory, located in an old mansion in the woods, is better equipped. Upon arriving however, they discover that Phillips and his assistants are all just as dead as Ian Bellows... and just as boneless. Reasoning that whatever Phillips was mucking around with started all of this, West, Stanley and Landers gathers up the dead scientist's notes to study them.

As soon as they've left, another farmer comes to complain to Constable Harris that one of his horses has been found dead and, shall we say, relieved of its skeleton. Harris hurries to the mansion to tell the three doctors, but arrives after they've gone. Doing a little exploring of his own, he is drawn to one room they didn't go into by a strange electronic warbling, the same Ian Bellows heard coming from the cave before, only to be seized by the throat by a green tentacle killed by the same thing that got Ian Bellows and Dr. Phillips and his assistants.

The entities responsible for all the sudden bonelessness on Petrie's Island, the results of Dr. Phillips' work to cure cancer, are squat, green things vaguely resembling starfish with one long tentacle each, which they use to inject a bone-dissolving enzyme into their victims. Worse, they are nigh impossible to kill, as poor Dr. Landers discovers when our heroes return to the mansion looking for the missing Harris, and he tries to kill one with an axe; Landers promptly exits the movie screaming. The creatures however also reproduce by fission, but luckily they are inert for a brief period after dividing, which allows West, Toni and Stanley to make a hasty getaway.

After learning all they can from Dr. Phillips' notes, West and Stanley opt to inform the islanders about the situation. Here we meet Roger Campbell and Peter Argyle, an older farmer and the owner of the village market respectively, whom the townspeople look to as their leaders. Despite appearing slow at first, the pair are quick to believe everything that the visiting doctors tell them (a little too quickly, in fact; there's being openminded and then there's being gullible), and offer their assistance in helping them destroy the monsters, which West and Stanley eventually dub ""Silicates.""

Campbell and his men attack the Silicates with everything they've got, but the creatures are amazingly tough: bullets, Molotov cocktails, and dynamite all fail to even hurt them. But hope is restored when a dead Silicate is found, and it turns out that the unfortunate monster died as a result of eating the bones of a dog from Dr. Phillips' laboratory, which were contaminated with Strontium-90, an isotope which settles in bone. West hatches himself a hare-brained scheme to destroy the bone-sucking beasties once and for all. After instructing Campbell and Argyle to sequester all the cows on the island in Campbell's cattle yard, he and Stanley return to the mansion and get some more Strontium 90 from Phillips' lab.

To do so, they must don very silly-looking radiation suits (which more resemble something you'd wear to protect yourself from germs, not radioactivity), and after a lengthy and suspenseful sequence (i.e. boring) of them carefully handling the radioactive materials, they are successful and make ready to depart the creepy manor for good. Unfortunately, on their way out, Stanley gets attacked by a lone Silicate whose tentacle grabs him by the wrist. Grabbing the axe dropped by Landers earlier, West is forced to amputate his friend's hand in order to save his life (a shot of the hand actually being cut off was added to the US release of the film).

Although Stanley survives, he spends the remainder of the movie confined to the local clinic. Using a strange silvery injector gun thingy, West contaminates all the cows in Campbell's cattle yard. Toni and the rest of the monster fodder--I mean townspeople are holed up in the town meeting hall until the crisis blows over, while West, Campbell and Argyle keep watch on the cattle. They do not have to wait long: the Silicates very swiftly appear and gobble up all the cow bones, then come after the three humans who hurriedly retreat to the meeting hall.

There's just one problem. The Silicates divide after eating the cows, which means the power and the effect of the Strontium-90 is cut in half, and will take that much longer to kill them. West, Toni, and the islanders have a siege ahead of them. They must hold out long enough for the isotope to kick in...

A minor cult classic of British horror that has sadly fallen through the cracks of time, 1966's Island of Terror is a movie that certainly deserves more fame than it's gotten over time (especially a proper American DVD release!) due to some stellar performances by a great little cast, headed by stalwart Peter Cushing, and also due to its frankly creepy central premise. Having your skeleton sucked out while you're still alive sounds pretty damn nasty! A shame the movie's budget wouldn't allow for actually showing it, although the boneless corpses we're treated to look pretty icky.",1338681600,,7350,4.950527169505271

killings where bodies of humans and animals are killed by having all the
bone removed. It's classic sci-fi horror. Kind of a cheap Hammer movie
but very well written and acted with great atmosphere. The ending is the
only part I am not crazy about but other than that highly recommended.

537736,4,6303046487,"One of my favorite British horror / sci-fi films, it pairs well with Day of the Triffids. What's fun about watching movies like these is that the British, and Japanese, during the 50's and 60's really play it straight! There's not a nod to the audience or a wink of the eye to suggest they think it's all in campy good fun. Maybe it's the accent that makes everything they do seem like their approaching Shakespeare. Whatever the reason, it is to the pictures benefit that cast and crew appear to take things seriously.

I think American audiences don't always realize what a swash-buckler Peter Cushing was. Check out his Van Helsing in the Hammer Dracula series; he swings from curtains, slides across long tables, and generally jets around with great vigor. His co-star, Edward Judd, has lent his brooding matinee looks to several genre films including X The Unknown, The Day the Earth Caught Fire (highly recommended), and H.G. Wells First Men on the Moon. They are accompanied by Carole Gray, previously seen in Curse of the Fly with Brian Donlevy. Her introductory scene wearing nothing but Edward Judd's' dress shirt is quite adult.

As noted (in other reviews) the islanders are a scruffy adult bunch with recognizable traits and concerns. All this 'adultness' is needed to sell the suspense and escalating sense of terror. Deaths, and dismemberment, due to contact with the Silicates is grim. The Silicates themselves are something else! With their saucer shaped body and long upright neck and head, they invoked in me an image of the spacecraft from War of the Worlds. This iconic shape taped into the fear I felt as a child watching the unstoppable alien craft laser beam death and destruction. This helped with the required 'suspension of belief' since the Silicates are obviously made of rubber. And how in the world did they get up in the trees?

As is often the case, the FX monster is the weak link, and it appears sparingly, particularly for the climactic battle when the Silicate ""leap"" from a barn roof onto terrified cows! This is a small budget film, make quick. And it works.",1254096000,,2097,4.803324099722992
537737,5,6303046487,"This is a prime example of a 'B' sci-fi/horror film, done well!  The cast is absolutely outstanding....I mean, how can you go wrong with Peter Cushing in a film?  The story moves along at a nice pace and while the visual effects might be a bit on the cheesy side, the audio effects are rather gruesome.

A quick synopsis......a medical research team is trying to discover a cure for cancer, but what they end up doing in their lab is producing 'creatures' that live on human and animal bones.  When the body of a local is discovered, sans any bones, the village Dr heads to London to seek the help of fellow Dr's.  It's only upon the return to the island that they discover what is causing the deaths and then they are in for a battle for the survival of the island.

Beware that the UK DVD release has the 'hand amputation/blood squirting scene' completely edited out, but I do hear that the German DVD release has the scene still fully intact.

All in all, a fun fifties style 'monster on the loose/trapped on an island' story with a tinge of British flavor which always adds some intelligence to these type of sci-fi flicks.",1149552000,15,569,4.6138613861386135
