8069271,3,B0009X76UK,"It's interesting to see this version of Light of the Western Stars.  However, Roan's print is not that great and not up to par with most of their releases.  This early Paramount western was one of their features re-issued in the 50's.  The opening and ending titles have been replaced.  The replacement title on this DVD is ""Winning the West"".  There is no explanation on the disc regarding this issue, so I do not know if any better prints exist.  Other than the titles, the feature does not appear edited as it runs its original running time of 70 min.  In response to the other reviewer, the man on the front cover is Victor Jory.  Roan also screwed up the cover by using pictures from the 1940 version.  In summary, if this is the best available, I can excuse it.  But Roan needs to offer an explanation so that we know what's going on.",1241568000,2,840,4.396103896103896
8069272,2,B0009X76UK,"I love the novel and of course do not expect the movie version to be comparable to the novel. However, some very important aspects of the novel were downplayed or removed (such as having the actual wedding scene) and the not so important aspects of the novel were emphasized (e.g., the initial drunk scene with the peddler).  It appeared that the peddler had to be the comic relief for this movie, which was par for the time but distracts from the plot.  The peddler should not be the focus of this story.

The presentation wasn't bad for an old 30's movie that wasn't electronically cleaned up, but I expect more from The Roan Group.

The biggest mistake (aesthetically) is that the man on the DVD cover is NOT Richard Arden (check IMDB).  Richard Arden was in the ""Island of Lost Souls"", ""Beggars of LIfe"" and other well-known movies.

The picture on the cover is of a fairly well-known actor of the time, but I cannot think of his name.  Maybe someone who has seen this DVD can assist.",1125187200,,988,4.51685393258427
