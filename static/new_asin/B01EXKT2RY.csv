In my own life, I bear so little resemblance to my siblings that I have often thought one of us must be adopted, and that that person is probably me. STILLPOINT is about a woman (the filmmaker, Penny Peyser) who sets out to understand her estranged sister, eight years after the latter joins the Stillpoint community. Stillpoint (the community) is just that, a place of stillness. Theres yoga, meditation, communal living, the jettisoning of given names and the sharing of everything.  Its a place that is open to all and when we arrive at the community with Peyser and her camera, we meet former Muslims, Jews, Catholics; ex-teachers, trust fund babies and pensioners. Everyone contributes to the extent he or she can for the betterment of all. Its a quiet existence, but as Stillpoints leader says at one point, Boredom is the mind wanting drama.

Shot over a few years, Peyser gives room to all those who have chosen to live their lives at Stillpoint and lets them tell their own stories. She gives them time to change as well as change their minds about being there. Some end up leaving, even as Peysers sister remains.

An event toward the end of the film causes the community and its residents to make difficult decisions and Peyser gracefully does not inject her own point of view into any of it. Ultimately I found the film to be a moving love letter from Peyser to her sister and I hope her sister appreciates it as much as I did.",1469059200,,1585,4.633451957295374

How the right personalities an stars must stay inline and how fragile relationships can be.  You will be surprised by the journey, and with all great tellings, leave you wanting more.  A passionate yet objective look into the lives of the people of Stillpoint.  I recommend it to everyone, but especially to young documentary filmmakers.",1464739200,,495,4.709302325581396
