6565000,5,B00M9HHJLU,"I had always watched this on the ""Destination America"" Channel.  I enjoyed it enough that I pondered on buying the seasons separately on occasion.  While shopping at Wal-Mart one day, I saw the 9 DVD Disc ""Special Edition"" for $20.  So slapped my money down to get it.
  For a TV Show, it's not to bad.  Even though it is HEAVILY edited for TV, I do enjoy seeing different stories.  And seeing that is has been on for 6 seasons is pretty nice.  The Only downside is that the ""Special Edition"", is a bit misleading.  Misleading in the fact that one expects a few extras.  This has no extras what so ever.  Just 9 DVDs with all of the 6 seasons.  So if you are buying this with the expectation that there will be anything more on these, tone down the expectation.
  But I am NOT unhappy with this.  6 Seasons of a TV Show for a good price was good enough for me.",1423699200,17,860,4.158536585365853

6565003,4,B00M9HHJLU,Was worried because reviews complained about quality...there is nothing wrong with the quality. Its not blu ray quality but its hella decent considering you get six seasons. Only complaint is that the seasons aren't labeled but other than that its fine,1500249600,2,252,5.170731707317073
6565004,5,B00M9HHJLU,"Fully satisfied:
1. Video quality looks just like the quality of the show when airing on cable. Nothing less than that.
2. Packaging was not bad all 9 dvd's came in there individual place.
3. Delivered on time.",1499904000,2,210,4.552631578947368
6565005,5,B00M9HHJLU,a haunting is one of my favorite paranormal shows 6 seasons on dvd is great i am happy with my purchase,1499644800,,103,3.9523809523809526
6565006,3,B00M9HHJLU,"Got this set here for a good price from Amazon Fulfillment. However, this is a 9 DVD set and it was packaged in a DVD case that holds only 8 discs.  The 9th disc was put into a paper envelope and shoved in the back of the case.  All the discs on hubs look great but the 9th DVD is scuffed up from being in the un-padded envelope.  I haven't played it, and as I had other discs that have been scuffed play fine I won't judge its play-ability until I try it.  The point is 9 disc cases are manufactured, why they didn't put the discs in one of those I don't understand.",1498694400,2,567,3.9473684210526314

6565008,5,B00M9HHJLU,"These are entertaining shows. Some of the videos are a little ""grainy"" but easily watchable. The sound is great. When we watched these shows on TV the sound faded in and out. That doesn't happen on the DVD's. IMHO, if you're into this kind of program, it's well worth the purchase.",1492387200,2,281,4.529411764705882
6565009,5,B00M9HHJLU,"looks fine, not sure why so many reviews said it looks VHS quality.  The original footage was not shot in hi-def and this hasn't been remastered to look better so it looks just like the original show.  nothing wrong with it at all.  In fact I'm surprised it looks as good as it does with so much content squeezed onto so few disks.",1490659200,5,331,4.222222222222222

6565019,5,B00M9HHJLU,"I was super excited whenever I found this series.
The quality of the DVD's were amazing! I had seen that some customers complained it was dark at some points. They filmed some parts like that for a scary effect. The box is a basic DVD box and none of the dvds were scratched. I highly recommend.",1475280000,3,295,4.285714285714286

6565021,5,B00M9HHJLU,"As other reviewers have stated not HD quality, but the price is unbeatable.  I knew this going forward.  I must say that I was surprised that the quality was better than I expected. Sound is perfect. The quality can be compared to that of a VCR recording. The picture is dark at times, but otherwise clear. I am very happy with my purchase.",1473724800,3,340,4.380952380952381

6565031,5,B00M9HHJLU,"Wow got this for $10 on amazon and what can i say, Its Great for the price. For THE price. Is it High quality ? Nope. Is it $10+ Quality ? Yup. I would even pay $20 for this set but even more happy that i only paid half of that. Worth more then $20 ? Nope. Has zero extras its just the standard Episodes. As for the picture quality,Its watchable and not to bad that you won't be able to enjoy it still. Would be even more nice if the quality was better but we are talking about a $10 Collection with HOURS and HOURS of Binge watching for a very reasonable price running off of 9 Disc. If you expect High quality and pretty pictures then this is NOT for you. Would be better off buying all the seasons separately that are also sold on here on amazon. Bottom line This is NOT for the ppl who who expect High Quality with crystal clear viewing or extra features for such a LOW price because this set definitely don't have those. This is for the ppl that don't mind NOT so good picture quality but love the idea of having Hours of episodes and all the seasons of 1-6 for a great price. Season 7 is sold separately.",1466208000,5,1110,4.073059360730594
6565032,3,B00M9HHJLU,"I love this show.
The DVDs are fine.
No damage.
But the casings for this product is GARBAGE!!!
I've bought this same profuct 3 times already and EVERY TIME the prgs that hold in the flip panels that hold the DVDs have been broken.
Take my advice and save your money.
Buy the series individually, or just stick with the Haunting in Georgia/Haunting in Connection double feature documentaries.",1466121600,,391,4.764705882352941

6565034,4,B00M9HHJLU,"Some people have complained about the picture quality...but realistically, you can't expect HD when the set runs 44 hours long on nine discs.

A great value for those who like the show.

Could the quality be better? Sure. And if it's that important, I would suggest buying the standalone seasons, which are available for more.

Me? I like having more to watch.",1465257600,9,360,4.774193548387097

Basically the show highlights a different paranormal case each episode with dramatic reenactments and interviews with the affected parties. Varies from ghosts to demons to possessions. I enjoy this show more than most of the ghost shows, mainly because of the dramatic reenactments.",1451952000,4,330,5.490196078431373

6565046,3,B00M9HHJLU,"Was disappointed in the first 5 minutes.
Quality looks like a 320p.
And no cc (subtitles) for hearing impaired.
 I haven't even gotten into them far enough to see how bad they are edited or cut up.  I'll update this review again and let you guys k of.

 UPDATE..
WAY TO DARK.. QUALITY IS VHS.  NO SUBTITLES.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE BLACKED OUT(ANONYMOUS).  unlike the ones I've seen.
 But for $15 6 seasons,  I can live with it.

 Find these free so where online and stream them.",1441324800,8,479,4.329545454545454

6565048,5,B00M9HHJLU,I love this television on the discovery channel and to have seasons 1-6 is awesome. This series is kind of like a documentary in my opinion because of the fact that it is based on individuals eyewitness accounts of their paranormal encounters.,1438905600,8,243,4.809523809523809

6565050,2,B00M9HHJLU,"This is a fun show to watch, as I like the documentary style of it. But I would buy the individual season sets rather than this ""complete set"" which is not complete as there are 7 seasons and this only has the first six. All they have done here is taken the previous six season sets (16 DVD's) and compressed them down to (9 DVD's) which leaves the video and audio quality on the episodes horrible! on some episodes they are so dark due to the compression that you can hardly make out what is going on. Also it fail to state that some of the episodes have been edited down from the previous sets to fit more episodes per disk. So again making this FAR from ""COMPLETE"". My advise forget this set and stick with the individual seasons for a few dollars more. Remember you get what you pay for!!",1428192000,39,792,4.251655629139073
8670900,5,B00M9HHJLU,"Absolutely nothing wrong with the quality; feels like I'm watching it just as I did on Discovery Channel. My casing for it is perfect; 9 slots for 9 DVDs. I got my money's worth and then some. I received this on Saturday, watched it all weekend and still had several discs left to watch. I didn't want to go back to work on Monday, lol. I used to watch this show all the time when the series first started airing on Discovery. It was always one of my favorites as a teenager. Some of the episodes are really freaky. I partially blame this show for my irrational fear of moving into a new house.  I will say I like the early episodes aired for Discovery more than Destination America (I'd never seen any by that network until now.) They just changed the feel of the acting and effects to try and be more dramatic, I guess, but it comes off as really cheesy at times. That's about the only thing negative I have to say about it. But I did still enjoy them, too. It may just be because I'm not a fan of change. Over all, I'm loving it and will watch it all many, many more times.",1530662400,,1076,4.148325358851674
