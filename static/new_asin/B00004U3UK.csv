1354084,4,B00004U3UK,"I first saw Sharpe's Rifles on the local Public TV station and enjoyed it. The film does NOT follow the book by Bernard Cornwell, but don't let this stop you. There's plenty of sword play and shooting in all of the Sharpe films.  The costumes, uniforms and weaponry are quite good, although sharp (no pun intended) history buffs will spot inaccuracies. Sean Bean captured the part in the first episode and made it his and Darragh O'Malley is the definative ""Srgt. Harper"".",1010016000,2,472,4.7560975609756095
1354085,4,B00004U3UK,"I've read all the previous reviews here about the Sharpe series. I also saw many of them on TV. So I was prepared when I got the DVD of Sharpe's Rifles the other weekend.
Yes, the quality of the DVD is no better than a VHS master.
In short, who cares? Watching the movie, I quickly forgot about  the quality and simply enjoyed a great telling of a great story.
It would have been nice if it were a little sharper (sorry about the pun) but look at it this way - in five years, the comparable VHS master will be so much video snow, and the DVD will still look the same as it did today!
I gave it 4 stars simply because I've come to expect ""extras"" with DVD's - cast and crew notes, bloopers, etc...none of which were present here. The presentation strikes me as a ""rush it to the market"" approach by the DVD maker. The original story more that makes up for it, though.",982368000,16,866,4.124260355029586
1354086,4,B00004U3UK,"Sharpe's Rifles, (and the rest of the Sharpe series), is a more gritty ""version"" of Horatio Hornblower (series from A&E). No, Sharpe is in no way related to Horatio, just for your information, this takes place in the Army while Horatio's was at sea.) Actually made BEFORE the Hornblower series, this one will engage you and make you want to see them all! (I've seen 4 in the series now.)Although some reviews have commented badly about the video quality, I would rate it as very good. It is about a B+ in my book, above VCD or VHS quality. Set during the early 1800's, Sharpe is an enlisted man that becomes an officer after saving the life of a lord from England. This series details his adventures as an officer, following him through many battles, promotions and romances. It focuses on his inability to fit into the ""officer corp,"" as most officer's from that period were wealthy men who bought their commissions. The ONLY problem I have had is figuring out the ORDER of the DVD's. They are technically ""mini movies,"" so you can watch them in any order, but watching them in their true order is most enjoyable. Here's what I have so far just so you know, (in order:) Sharpe's Rifle, Sharpe's Eagle, Sharpe's Company, and I THINK the next one is Sharp's Enemy. Hint: look on the side binder of the DVD, their are little codes, these should go in numerical hierarchy, for example, ""98579-D,98580-D,98598-D"". These won't necessarly be in sequence, (i.e. 1,2,3,4,5) but more like 2,7,11,14 for example. So you should be able to figure it out when you get them.  Bottom line: if you like mini-series like the early 80's ""Shogun,"" and ""Horatio Hornblower,"" you'll like this one too.",981504000,18,1680,4.714285714285714
1354087,4,B00004U3UK,"This film is the first of a great series following the  career of an English soldier in the Napoleonic wars. The adventures are seen from the viewpoint of Richard Sharpe, played convincingly by Sean Bean,who is always at the fore-front of the action. This first film is mostly about getting to know the characters who will appear in the rest of the series , yet has one of the most interesting storylines , and stays faithful to the book it's  based on (written by Bernard Cornwell).
Action,adventure,romance - this series has the lot,and comes highly recommended. Also worth mentioning are the books - absolutely fantastic ,and strongly recommended for anyone interested in the Napoleonic period , as is the epic film  ""Waterloo"".",974505600,19,731,4.975409836065574
1354088,4,B00004U3UK,"Richard Sharpe is on DVD, and better than ever! Sharpe's Rifle's, the first in the series of Sharpe films made for BBC television and aired on Masterpiece Theater in the U.S. is an exciting starting point for people  who are not familiar with the brilliant series of novels by Bernard  Cornwell. It is also a great showcase for the talents of Sean Bean, who we  will see more of next year in The Lord of the Rings.  The movie follows  Lieutenant Richard Sharpe, a British soldier during the Napoleonic wars, as  he takes command of a rifle company and sends whole bunches of Frenchies to  their graves.  Action galore and interesting period detail.  Fans of the  book series may be suprised at the early appearance of Teresa in  ""Rifles"" (in the books she doesn't show up until ""Sharpe's  Gold"") but fear not! It won't ruin the story for you.

1354103,5,B00004U3UK,"First off its the only time you won't see Sean Bean die on film which is some kind of minor miracle or violation of the cosmic order depending on your perspective.

This episode is the first in a series of mini movies/episodes that introduce Bernard Cornwell's Sharpes novels set during the Napoleonic Wars.  The adaption to the screen is loving and largely faithful to the books.  The role of Richard Sharpe was made for Sean Bean.  Sharpe is brash, reckless, passionate, and brilliant.  The supporting cast is top notch with Brain Cox and Daragh O'Malley excellently playing Hogan and Harper.

The story involves Sharpe, a British man of low upbringing who was promoted from the ranks into the officers corp, executing a daring secret mission on behalf of Hogan, an intelligence officer in the British Army.

Sharpe is a man caught between worlds.  The officer corp of the day was  exclusively composed of the landed gentry.  Sharpe combats discrimination by his social ""superiors,"" and must use all that he's learned in his life as a rank and file soldier to win their respect and that of his men.

Both the series and books are excellent and I highly recommend them.  Also, anyone with interest in or fondness for this series or its ilk should check the Hornblower series and books both of which are also excellent as well.",1353974400,,1327,4.771929824561403
1354104,5,B00004U3UK,"I first caught some of the Sharpe's series on PBS. I instantly became intrigued by the whole Napoleonic era. I bought all the Sharpe's novels and I highly recommend them for the action and historical fiction fan. During the same period of time I bought all of the Sharpe's Dvds, accept for Sharpe's Gold, and I love them.

There are many small flaws to the books and Dvds. The writing in both can be a bit over-the-top and cheesy at times. The acting is solid, but Sir Laurence Olivier has nothing to worry about. Like a lot of British television productions the picture quality is not the best. The Dvds don't have all the back ground information that the books have, but if you watch the whole series you will learn more, and more about Richard Sharpe. Also, the budget for the series doesn't allow for the grander scale of the novels. Battles will have a few hundred soldiers instead of thousands.

Now for the good, these are pure action yarns. The Napoleonic ear makes for an interesting back-drop for these action stories. You will learn to love the good guys and hate the bad guys. Sean Bean does a very good job playing Richard Sharpe. The supporting cast is good especially Brian Cox. The stories are solid and there is plenty of shooting and sword-play. I give this Blu-Ray disk a big thumbs up! The Sharpe's series is one of my favorite action television series ever!",1348272000,4,1378,4.574898785425101
1354105,2,B00004U3UK,"Having read all the Sharpe novels, I was excited to watch the DVDs.  Not knowing how they were going to be, I ordered a few and just watched the first one.  Sharpe's Rifles.  Where do I start?  The acting is horrible.  Sean Bean and the writers catch  none of Sharpe's personality.  The battle scenes which were small ones in this story were terrible.  They looked like what you'd see in a high school stage production.  I don't even know what to say about Wellington except that was not a good portrayal.  Sgt Harper is off by about 6 inches and 100 lbs.  Did I mention how flat Sean Bean is?  It needs to be mentioned twice.  I hope the others are better.

1354106,3,B00004U3UK,"The acting was how can I put it, to much like American TV instead of quality British TV. I know they are trying to establish who Sharpe is in a short time, but it had the rushed feeling of an American TV show instead of the deliberate pacing I expect from quality British TV. Overall I found the character development one dimensional and rushed. But having said that I will most likely purchase all of these on Blu-Ray. I love this period of military history and there doesn't appear to be anything better out there.",1345593600,,516,4.442105263157894

1354109,4,B00004U3UK,"Not many Americans are as familiar with Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series as we are say Hornblower or Patrick O'Brien's seafaring fiction. A & E's films series of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series and the big screen release of Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World starring Russell Crowe have helped these stories find an audience, but the British made for television Sharpe movies have yet to find mass American appeal. Honestly I don't know why.

1993's Sharpe's Rifles starts the series in good fashion. Known for his mostly villainous roles in US productions, Sean Bean (Patriot Games, The Fellowship of the Ring) stars are Sergeant Richard Sharpe, a ruffian journeyman soldier in the midst of England's war with Napoleon in Spain. After saving the life of Arthur Wellesley (David Troughton)-soon to become Lord Wellington-Sharpe is promoted to Lieutenant and placed in charge of the 95th rifles' Chosen Men. Sharpe struggles with the gentlemen above him who have bough their commissions while earning the respect of his sharpshooters-including Irish Rifleman Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley). Intelligence Major Hogan (Brian Cox) sends Sharpe and his men across Spain in search of a missing banker carrying a badly needed gold draft for the English Army. Along the way, Sharpe must help Major Vivar (Simon Andreu) and Commandante Teresa Moreno (Assumpta Serna) and their Spanish guerillas inspire the oppressed Spanish people against the French.

It seems like a lot, yes, and considering Sharpe's Rifles takes from several of Cornwell's books, there's much to set up, back story to explain, people to introduce. This first in the series sometimes falls into the pitfalls that come with introducing one to a series. Which is meant to be the story? Sharpe's bonding with his men and Teresa or the mission? Each storyline presented is tied up all in good time. One need not continue with the series, but one need not see Rifles to appreciate the second film Sharpe's Eagle.

If the story or set up seems thin, then it is the characters that will keep you watching. We may hate him in America if we know him at all (My husband calls Sean Bean a `glorified extra'!) but Sharpe made Bean a household name in the UK. The RADA trained actor can show Sharpe's anger and doubt, as well as his sensitive side. Yet Bean looks the rough and tumble part. Natural to say that if you don't like him, you won't like Sharpe. Richard can be quite an arse from time to time, but he is a soldier of his time. Likewise we may not be used to the stereotypical Chosen Men, but all fit their parts. The educated Harris, The boy Perkins, and of course Harper-the Irish man serving in the English Army.

Not all for the boys, Assumpta Serna is perfectly cast as Teresa Moreno. The tough guerilla leader shows her soft side with Sharpe. It's not an easy role-the ice queen type- but Serna looks the part of this intelligent noblewoman fighting with the consequences of her war torn country.

One miss for Sharpe's Rifles is the score. The nineties electric guitar music is completely off for the time period onscreen, and the style has not stood the test of time. With such British-ness already about it, the `Over The Hills and Far Away' song is perhaps also too English for us across the pond. A rousing classical score would have served the series better. The look of Rifle's may also seem on the cheap now, but the uniforms, weaponry, and locales all carry the right authenticity to them. The scale for the first film here is small, dealing mostly with peripheral action during the war. Some of the fighting does, however, look ill chorographer and edited. In some sequences we see rifleman simply falling on the ground or Sharpe himself merely looking around in the smoke. There's a lot of military violence, but little blood and gore.

Spoiled younger audiences would probably skip Sharpe's Rifles but the solid story from Cornwell adapted by Eoghan Harris is worth a gander. Female fans of Sean Bean will no doubt enjoy, but military fans looking for rough action or Napoleonic authenticity will also get hooked on Sharpe. Kids under 10 may not understand all the military politics or shy from the kissing scenes, but it could be fun to turn tweens onto the films and perhaps the Sharpe novels.

Sharpe's Rifles is available individually on DVD or in several Sharpe sets. Unfortunately there are no features, and the digital transfer doesn't look the best quality. Whether the gritty look is what the production was going for or if its simply weak technology, I don't know, but the ills don't infringe on the viewing. In fact, the negatives are all but forgotten once you get into the twist and turns, action, intrigue, and romance that seem to follow Sharpe.

Is Sharpe's Rifles the best film in the series? No, but as the introductory film, it doesn't necessarily have to be. What you need to know is set for a British boys' good time. Good enough even for us Americans to enjoy.",1229299200,,4976,4.7981330221703615

These productions capture the feel of the books: Sharpe's honest character, his irresistibility to beautiful women (and them to him), exciting battles scenes, nefarious backstabbing, and the colorful characters. Sean Bean excels as Richard Sharpe (though he seems a bit too pretty at first). Brian Cox is wonderful as the intelligence officer Hogan, Daragh O'Malley convinces as the burly Irish Seargant Harper, Assumpta Serna plays the sensual, but fiery Spanish noblewoman and rebel fighter, and David Troughton plays Sir Arthur with just the right touch.

He made the rare advancement from the common rank and file redcoat to the lofty rank of commissioned officer.  This movie does a good job of showing the reader the trials of the common redcoated soldier of the late 1700s.

1354114,4,B00004U3UK,"I came to Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe series after reading other novels by ""Britain's Storyteller.""  Cornwell's series focuses on Richard Sharpe, gutter-trash from the stews of London who rises through the ranks to become a valued player in Wellington's titanic clash against Napoleon.  I'm about half-way through the books, but I couldn't wait before diving into the DVDs of the British TV adaptations of those novels.

""Sharpe's Rifles"" is the first DVD in this series and has the disadvantage of having to conflate several episodes from different novels into its two-hour running time.  The most obvious quirk is that the movie kicks off with Sharpe saving Wellington's life from French raiders while stationed in Spain, whereas in the books Sharpe actually saved Wellington's life while fighting in India.  But this is a minor quibble, for ""Sharpe's Rifles"" is a fun, extremely low-budget romp through Cornwell's novel of the same name.

How low budget is ""Sharpe's Rifles""?  It's hard to say, but it's pretty clear that this movie was filmed in about a month with a few guys running around on ten acres of land.  This isn't a criticism, but instead a compliment to the filmmakers, who still manage to tell an entertaining story despite their modest means.  Sharpe, promoted from the ranks (which was rarely done in the classist British army), takes charge of the 95th Rifles, the ""greenjackets.""  The rifle was a new invention - most soldiers carried muskets that couldn't hit a barn beyond fifty paces.  The musket was cheap and perfect for lines of infantry to line up and blast each other to pieces.  The rifle, on the other hand, was a killer at long range, and the 95th Rifles were made up of the ""Chosen Men.""  These men were chosen for their shooting ability rather than their noble traits - as a result, the Rifles are populated with a bunch of loveable mutts, led by Irishman Sergeant Harper.

""Sharpe's Rifles"" turns on an expedition for the Rifles into Spain to retrieve a critical bank draft to allow Wellington to keep his army together - soldiers get unruly if they haven't been paid for three months.  But the mission takes a side trip as Sharpe meets up with some Spanish loyalists who are trying to rally the country against Napoleon . . . and these loyalists are opposed by Spaniards who want nothing more but for Napoleon to conquer all of Europe.  Bullets fly and bayonets stab aplenty in this pell-mell story.

Sean Bean is perfectly cast as the rakish Sharpe, and Brian Cox is another great choice as the intelligence man Major Hogan.  Everyone else is more or less filler, but quality filler.  One of the few blatant criticisms I have of this movie is the anachronistic heavy-handed use of an electric guitar in the soundtrack - what were they thinking?

But this is a minor criticism of a fine, if low-budget, movie.  Check it out, and you will surely join the legions of Richard Sharpe fans.",1171411200,,2927,4.802395209580839

In Britian at the time the whole of the Kingdom was absolutly hooked on [Our] Richard Sharpe and his Chosen Men.  Like in this country, all waited each year for {Soprano's etc]. For Sharpe and his chosen men.

Well, I returned to the USA and to my utter delight, I saw on BBC American they were going to show the Sharpe series in full.  You [Yanks] as we Brits call the Americans had never seen or heard of Sharpe's Rifle's!  I called all my friend and family, screaming my delight.  Watch this!!

Bottom line, quite a few are hooked. and have bought all the series DVD's.

1354117,5,B00004U3UK,"If you liked Horatio Hornblower, you'll love this series. I missed them when they first aired--my loss! Thank goodness they are available on DVD! We happened across a later episode while browsing the satellite channels, watched part of it, and tried to record a later broadcast. Unfortunately, it was a two part story, but we were so impressed we looked for and ordered the first episode on DVD. We've watched it 3 times, so far, each as entertaining and interesting as the last.

The acting is very good, the casting excellent, the scripting well thought out. The dialogue is occasionally a bit difficult at first, because the actors are speaking very like the dialect of the times, with reasonable accents--but this adds to the marvelous flavor. There are some historical inaccuracies, but the film requires little suspension of disbelief--the changes make the story better, preserve the flavor of the times, or at least are necessary to the practicality of the film. For example, Sharpe's men are supposed to be using rifles. Use of a blackpowder, muzzleloading rifle in combat presents certain significant technical difficulties which would greatly interfere with the flow of the story. So the actors are carrying muskets instead of rifles. Only a historian or historical re-creationist of that era would notice.

If you are interested in the Napoleanic era, the history of the British Empire, or just enjoy excellent historical drama, this is well worth your money, IMHO.",1167955200,3,1476,5.1203319502074685

Seventeen novels to go.

However, I would NOT have had it any other way! The film reminded me of the great British-made TV series' I had watched as a child on Polish TV: ""I, Claudius"" and ""The Forsythe Saga"". Courage, honor, friendship and love are no longer feelings that run deep in today's society. It was fascinating to watch them all revived, even if only for a couple of hours, on the silver screen.

I am glad that I saw the films before reading the novels. Otherwise, I may have been a bit dissapointed. The ""novel"" Sharpe seems to be more real: he is complex and more human then the Sharpe in the films. I will not take part in the ""which one is better?"" debate. To me at least, they are two different characters.

Mr. Bean did a supperb job playing Sharpe. It was startling at first to see this talented actour play a character who was NOT psychotic.

Watch the films, read the books! But be warned: both are highly addictive!

(four stars out of five, for the low budgets cused a severe lack of extras; most of the time you are stretching your imagination in order to believe that Sharpe is taking part in battles that in reality may have involved between 1000 and 600,000 soldiers; pity)",1159401600,,1511,4.401433691756273
1354119,5,B00004U3UK,"I can't imagine an American producer even attempting a epic series of 15 productions like this.  We can't even get Ted Turner to do the last of the God and Generals-Gettysburg-Final Measure trilogy.

I also can't believe I first heard of the Sharpe's series this year.

I did get a fairly bad version of Rifles with sound that did not remain constant and some scenes grainy.  I hope the rest of the series is reproduced better.",1156723200,5,427,4.578947368421052
1354120,4,B00004U3UK,"This television movie is heaps of fun.  I found it to be a satisfying mix of melodramatic adventure with a healthy sprinkling of bodice-ripping.  If you are a geek like me and you like to watch historical dramas for the costumes and good-looking men - it doesn't get much better than this.  Sean Bean is a tough and sexy-as-all-get-out Richard Sharpe, and there's loads of fist-fights and daring-do.

There's only one reason I'm withholding a 5th star.  This was made in the early 90's and I even though I don't know if it was originally shot on film or on BETA I would still expect to see broadcast quality on a DVD.  However, the image seemed about on par with VHS.

That said, I still really enjoyed it!",1142035200,,706,4.46875
1354121,5,B00004U3UK,Excellent.  Sean Bean was great!  I had heard about this series from a friend.  I am a big fan of the Horatio Hornblower series dealing with the British Navy in the Napoleanic era.  This series shows the same period from the prospective of the British Army.  Sharpe is a very strong character and played very well by Sean Bean.  I am used to seeing Mr. Bean as a bad guy which he does very well but I was intrigued by his strength and humanity in this series.  Sharpe is not perfect even though he is an excellent marksmen. The rifleman under his company originally hate Sharpe because he was promoted into the officer class from the enlisted.  But his leadership gains the respect of his men.,1130284800,7,693,4.444444444444445
1354122,5,B00004U3UK,"I suppose the idea that Richard Sharpe is sort of Horatio Hornblower on land is apt enough, mainly because both characters have the advantage of stellar British television productions whereas Lucky Jack Aubrey has only the one cinematic adventure to date. But clearly the Napoleonic Wars are the British Empire's answer to the American Civil War without the problematic element of fighting against brother against brother. Napoleon is a secular anti-Christ trying to force the ideals of the French Revolution down the throats of Europe, so no shades of blue and gray here, this is all black and white.

 The set up is fairly simple and compelling. One day Sir Arthur Wellesley (David Troughton), early in the career that would see him become the Duke of Wellington, is out for a ride on his horse when French dragoons come after him. Wellesley escapes death through the heroic efforts of Sergeant Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean), who is promoted to lieutenant on the spot by the grateful commander of British forces in Spain. Of course, promoting from the ranks makes Sharpe neither fish nor fowl, with the gentlemen in the officer's office refusing to consider him an equal and the enlisted personal dismissing the idea that he is a ""real"" officer.

 Just to make things interesting Major Hogan (Brian Cox), Wellesley's master spy, sends the new lieutenant off on a secret mission. The story is that the men have not been paid in two weeks, going on three, so the mission is to find a missing banker who has funds (although why the men in the field need money strikes me as odd: after all, we are talking pounds and shillings not Euros). But Sharpe is off to a bad start as he buts heads with sharpshooter Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley), the leader of the men, who challenges the new lieutenant's control of his men. Then a wounded Major Blas Vivar (Simon Andreau) has to confide in Sharpe the real nature of the mission.

 Based on Bernard Cornwell's first novel in the Sharpe series, ""Sharpe's Rifles"" has the virtue of strong multiple conflicts. Sharpe has to accomplish his mission and try to earn the respect of his men while that mission becomes more and more complicated. As you would expect, this is a first rate historical drama that has an above average sense of authenticity. Bean's Sharpe is too busy trying to command respect Then we have Teresa (Assumpta Serna), a Spanish lady who has good reason to seek revenge upon the French and another reason for recommending this movie is that the relationship between Teresa and Sharpe is actually an adult one.

 The same thing can be said for the relationship between Sharpe and Harper, which is developed properly without any of the cheap shortcuts that can be taken to move things along. The primary quality that Bean brings to the character of Sharpe is the sense of being a real man in real situations, without being overtly heroic. This is a man with a mission and there are other missions to come, not to mention all those books.",1091664000,70,2991,4.760617760617761
1354123,4,B00004U3UK,A friend of mine loaned me the whole 14 tape series back in 97 and I have loved it ever since. I am a military reenactor and loved the detail that they kept to with the uniforms and food and all the other stuff. For action and adventure as well as seeing the whole class warfare of the time period this is one of the best.,1052611200,4,322,3.893939393939394
1354124,5,B00004U3UK,"I had not read any of Sharpe's books before watching the series. However, I love British TV drama and novel adaptations, and I love the period in which Sharpe's adventures are set, so after reading the reviews in Amazon.co.uk, I decided to give it a try. And now I'm hopelessly hooked! All the actors' performances are wonderful, but Sean Bean's is simply stunning. The story is very respectful to the people who lived in Spain in those times, both those who were for and against the French (I'm Spanish. I know), and it is even respectful to the French enemy. The plot is a mixture of adventure and spy story, with quite a bit of criticism of the British class system thrown in. This is as good as a historical novel can be (and I've read quite a few)especially because of the feeling you get that the characters belong to the period in the way they think and the way they act. In fact, it would answer the question What were all those handsome officers from Jane Austen's novels doing when they were not dancing with her heroines?. This is the other side of the same story, without contradicting it. The hero,Sharpe, belongs to the ""dregs"" of society, he is ""scum"", although he is more human and braver than the petty officers who have purchased their comissions and who are, otherwise, so elegant and so good at dancing with Austen's heorines. I am also beginning to read all the Sharpe's novels and I love them. Bravo Sharpe! Stand and Fight!",1046131200,96,1446,4.565384615384615
1354125,4,B00004U3UK,"Being a big fan of the books, I eagerly awaited receiving the Sharpe DVD's for Christmas. However, in parts, the films didn't quite live up to my expectations.
Looking through the Extras, there was a selection of production notes. Reading these notes, it revealed that none of the shots in the entire series used more than 250 extras, and this is quite apparant when watching the films.
The action and battle sequences are too short by far, and of a poor quality. Here I must level a criticism at Sean Bean, as the Sharpe I see when reading action bits in the book is fierce and relentless. When Bean fights, he does so a little tentatively, and not very brutally as I picture Sharpe doing.
The director, knowing he was on a tight budget, has concentrated on the non-combat sequences, which is a wise move. These parts are far better, and credit must go to the actor that plays Hogan, as the wily engineer is, for me, the best character on the first two films.
Sharpe's Rifles was a bit disappointing, especially the tussle between Sharpe and Harper. This wasn't nearly physical enough or fast enough. Again the final fight was poor as well. 3 stars is my rating for Sharpe's Rifles.
Sharpe's Eagle was drastically better. Hogan for me was the star of this film. His mannerisms are just as I imagined them to be when reading. What makes Sharpe's Eagle better than Sharpe's Rifles is that there are less combat scenes, the emphasis being on Sharpe's vendetta with Henry Simmerson and his two lackeys. The only disappointing bits were Sharpe's fight with Berry and the criminally short final fight.
Overall, these films have stood the test of time well. The battle scenes show the lack of budget, but the films are an entertaining diversion - recommended to anyone who has read the books.",1041206400,4,1786,4.673015873015873
1354126,5,B00004U3UK,"I bought this movie on a whim, after reading one of the books.  The movie was very nicely paced giving you a chance to catch your breath between action shots.  While actually providing you with a since of travel and time passing, by having them camp at night.  Too many movies seem to forget the minor details, like that help show the passage of time.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good action of the Napoleonic Era.",1025136000,4,436,4.4125
1354127,1,B00004U3UK,"The BBC Sharpe's Series DVDs are a very very poor picture (the worst I've seen). I bought all four original Sharpe's episodes on DVD and they all are much worse quality (picture and sound) than are the VHS copies I had purcahsed years ago [and VHSs deterioriate with use]!
The Richard Sharpe series based on the novels by Bernard Cromwell are absolutely fabulous, and they deserve a FAR better treatment than is presented here! The viewer does not even have the option of going directly to a menu screen, but is forced to fast forward through the opening titles and theme song.
Whomever transferred these made-for-tv episode films to MPG2 should be publicly humiliated - this is a disgrace! The picture is fuzzy and grainy as heck! The VHS cassettes actually look better, if you can believe that! I never thought VHS would beat DVD in quality until I compared the Sharpe's series side-by-side. The VHS won out every time.
The sound quality is extremely poor on the DVDs too, it has a hiss and sounds muffled. Again, the VHS wins out!
Buy these on VHS until enough of us complain and they discontinue these ""Joke DVDs"" and deliver the public the Sharpe's Series at a transfer rate that is not just acceptable - but worthy of this incredibly brilliant historic series!",1017360000,56,1266,4.707207207207207

I probably don't have to praise the actors to anybody who has read the cast list but here I go anyway.  Sean Bean is a great action star as the hero, Richard Sharpe, an officer who has come up through the ranks.  Asumpta Serna, as the Spanish guerilla leader and Sharpe's love interest, is beautiful and soulful.  Brian Cox, an actor seemingly incapable of anything other than perfection, gives another one of his flawless performances as Wellington's staff intelligence officer.  And high praise has to go to Daragh O'Malley as Sergeant Harper.

The makers of the movie took a number of liberties with Cornwell's story, but the result is fairly good.

7923586,5,B00004U3UK,"I really hated the first BFS release of this series on DVD, but wow, what an improvement this disk is over the old American license DVD.  When I first saw this series on PBS back in the 90s, the first two or three episodes were presented in letterbox format, and for NTSC video the image was fairly good.  But for some reason later showings showed a low-def regular 16 milimeter print with a 4:3 aspect ratio.

This bluray edition really shows off the quality of super-16 film stock.  The image is crips and clean, and you can see every detail, right down to individual strands of hair and the texture of skin and clothing.  Visually it's really wonderful, and of course it's Sean Bean in one of his most popular roles with Daragh O'Malley as his sergeant.

At the time of this writing I'm very sorry that this edition has gone out of print.  Hopefully more blurays of the first two in the Sharpe series for American audiences will be forth coming.

As a point of interest, he was at the Battle of Barossa and that is where the actual first French Eagle was captured, not as shown in the Sharpe story of Sharpe's Eagle.
