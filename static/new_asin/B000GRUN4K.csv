It is surprising, bracing, at times mind-blowing, full of great performances---a breath of feminist fresh air by an ambitious and talented filmmaker!",1524009600,,249,5.048780487804878

8134074,5,B000GRUN4K,"While it's called ""The Girls"" this is definitely a film about Women -- their rights (or lack of them), their place in society, their happiness & aspirations. And if you think that sounds drearily didactic, think again! Mai Zetterling's exploration of women in  Sweden circa 1968-- and the entire world, really -- is filled with sharp wit & humor, dazzling fantasy sequences in beautifully over-exposed B&W, a complex & nuanced view of both men & women & their relationships, and the chance to watch three superb actresses normally associated with Ingmar Bergman acting in very different directions.

The plot: a touring company of the classic Aristophanes comedy ""Lysistrata"" finds the parallels between art & everyday life for women, as the three friends cope with their own personal relationships & their relationships with society. While the references are topical, now some 40+ years old, the ideas are as fresh & relevant as ever -- perhaps even more so, since contemporary society has hit such a retrograde, conservative obstacle in the form of reactionary fundamentalism. The questions the film raises about the roles of women, sexuality, war, jobs, the usefulness of art, and a meaningful life, are all just as pressing today.

But again, I don't want to make it sound like a preachy tract. Before all else, this intelligent & artistic film is FUN. From the sly, wry, bemused & sometimes confused faces of the characters on their outer (and inward) journeys, to the astonishing cinematography, and especially to the surrealistic fantasy sequences that let us see what these women are thinking & feeling, the film is filled with energy, sardonic jokes, and a dizzying sense of exhilaration & hopes for personal freedom -- very much the tone of the times in 1968! Whether you're interested in how people felt then, or want to see how such a film still applies today, or simply want to watch a work of cinematic art, this film is most highly recommended!",1417824000,,1959,4.984709480122324
8134075,5,B000GRUN4K,"The Girls, structured around a tour of Lysistra, stands the test of time.  Made in 1968 forty years later Mai Zetterling's film still has much to say about the roles of women and men in society capturing both the playfulness of Aristophanes work and the more serious issues raised in the lives of the characters.  But what struck me most was a sense of fun and friendship from the three leading actresses, they know each other they know what they are trying to accomplish and they enjoy doing it together.  It is never a bad thing to watch three fine actors do great work. Harriet, Bibi and Gunnel are stalwarts of Bergman era Swedish film and deliver extraordinary performances once again",1246406400,5,689,4.677685950413223
8134076,5,B000GRUN4K,"Truly was expecting a Bergman feel to this, Zetterling's other New Yorker Video release ""Loving Couples"" could easily fit in with much of Bergman's work from the same period. This film however would make a great companion to ""8 1/2"". It has the same strangeness.

Great slightly abstract scenes (and the movie is full of them) such as Gunnel Lindblom (looking a bit like Anouk Amiee) being chased by an increasing large group of boys through a shopping center can easily be compared to Fellini.

Also Gunnar Bjornstrand gets to present a character that is entirely different than anything he did for Bergman.",1179619200,,608,4.893203883495145
