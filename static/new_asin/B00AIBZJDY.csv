5428301,4,B00AIBZJDY,"Teen sex comedies are a strange beast.  If they are done just for the sake of raunchiness, they can give audiences (particularly the teen audiences) several cheap laughs, but are quickly forgotten.  A lot of films by the Farrelly Brothers, Adam Sandler, and the disasters foisted upon us by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"") fall into that category.

  However, when the films show a greater understanding of their characters and the hormonal confusion of that age, they tend to be more memorable.  The first ""American Pie"" film fit that bill perfectly.  Now, we have ""The To-Do List"", which not only understands what it's like to be a teenager with nothing but sex on the mind, it also understands what it was like to live in 1993.

  The plot of ""The To-Do List"" centers on Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza), a very studious, accomplished and stuck-up high school valedictorian who has led a very sheltered life, partially due to her conservative father and partially due to her on choosing.  Following graduation, she works a summer job as a lifeguard at run down pool and finds herself very attracted fellow lifeguard, Rusty, a piece of man-candy with the all the 1993 cliches:  sensitive guitar playing, ripped abs, and long Seattle-style rocker hair.  Brandy realizes that her insulated upbringing has left her with virtually no sexual knowledge.  So, the highly organized Brandy sets out a `to-do list' of sexual activities she wants to engage in as part of her goal of sleeping with Rusty by summer's end.  The curiosity and embarrassment that ensue are experiences all of us remember during our own `coming-of-age'.

  Aubrey Plaza does a wonderful job of portraying the confused, but determined, Brandy as a curious teenager who is committed to learning about physical activities in her own rigid, regimented way.  Her supporting cast includes her best friends Fiona (Alia Shawkat) and Wendy (Sarah Steele), who talk a big game when encouraging Brandy to go for it with her list, but seem to not be as experienced as they make themselves out to be.

  The audience was in stitches throughout the entire movie (myself included).  Any comedy that can get create that kind of experience for its audience is worth seeing.  ""The To-Do List"" needs to be on your `to-do list'.",1374969600,15,2326,4.935567010309279
5428302,2,B00AIBZJDY,"It's relatively safe to say the teen comedy is on the verge of death - at least for the moment.  With so many different films attempting to ride the coattails of America Pie, film writers have been dead set outdoing each other in the ""outlandish"" department with each new film.  While American Pie can be credited with the modern success of the ""sex comedy,"" it was classics like Porky's, Animal House, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High that set the stage for Pie's eventual success.  In the year's following its 1999 release, several similar incarnations of America Pie were released - including Superbad, Van Wilder, and The Girl Next Door.  Each of these films, and countless others like it, followed the exact same premise, making sex the most important aspect of teen adolescence.  However, due to the over abuse of the ""teen sex comedy,"" it has become an utterly predictable genre, currently lacking originality.  Recent films, such as 21 & Over, Project X, and even American Reunion, have all been commercially successful - yet failed to contribute something new or different to the genre.  Adding to the list of unoriginal teen sex comedies is the new film, The To Do List.

Making her feature-length directorial debut, Maggie Carey writes and directs The To Do List, starring Aubrey Plaza as Brandy Klark.  The year is 1993 and Brady is graduating high school at the top of her class, but she has never had a sexual experience in her life.  Deciding she needs to be experienced before entering college, she makes a ""to do"" check list of sexual maneuvers that will remedy her lack of experience.  She takes a job at the local public swimming pool, which also happens to be where her ""crush,"" Rusty Waters (Scott Porter), is working for the summer.  From beginning to end, it's a summer full of hijinks as Brandy focuses on finishing her checklist while dealing with her straightforward parents, verbally abusive sister, and drunken boss.  Bill Hader, Rachel Bilson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Alia Shawkat, Sarah Steel, Johnny Simmons, Connie Britton, and Clark Gregg also star in supporting roles.

Aubrey Plaza does an admirable job of leading the charge in this humorous, raunchy flick.  Her character has a stern sensibility - unwavering and direct.  And while Plaza is a like-able main character, she's not that loveable.  In comparison to other main characters in teen sex comedies, like Jonah Hill or Jason Biggs, there's really no ambition to root for Brandy Klark.  She exudes far too much confidence to create a believable story and frankly, she really doesn't face a conundrum over the course of this film - other than when or if she should attempt to ""close the deal"" with her male infatuation, Rusty Waters.  Over the course of the film, her character is too promiscuous for her own good, which doesn't exactly paint a pretty picture for the seemingly meaningless acts of her teen angst.

While the Brandy Klark character and her unbelievably direct ambitions are the major hang-up of this film, the rest of the supporting characters make up for it with a great deal of absurd interactions of their own, making for plenty of unrealistic laughs - if you're into sexual humor.  Some of the scenes really press the limit of the R-rating, including a rather memorable movie theater experience, an encounter in the pool's shower room, and a frightfully embarrassing father/daughter moment during the closing minutes of the film.  Speaking of the father, Clark Gregg, whom many will recognize as Agent Coulson from Marvel's The Avengers, plays Brandy's father - a sheltered parent that is easily embarrassed by his wife and daughters.  Friday Night Lights alum Connie Britton plays his wife and Brandy's mother - the brutally honest parent that openly prepares her daughters for sex.  On the plus side, nearly each and every scene involving Clarke and Britton will provide for a substantial amount of laughter.  Rachel Bilson, who plays Brandy's sister in the film, also provides a handful of laughs with her critical, often verbally abusive language towards Brandy.

The To Do List could easily change its name to ""Superbad 2"" as both Superbad and The To Do List mirror each other in plot direction, only from the opposite side of the gender spectrum.  Both films put sex on a pedestal for curious teens, with Superbad obviously focusing on the high school male perspective, while The To Do List focuses on the female aspect of sexual encounters.  And oddly enough, both films feature Bill Hader and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in supporting roles.  Mintz-Plasse, who struck stardom as the awkward teen, McLovin, is not as prominent in this film as he was in Superbad.  Hader, on the other hand, plays a similar character - which doesn't take life too seriously and often spends his time doing irresponsible things, like drinking all day and well, drinking all night, too.  Still - in the grand scheme of things, these supporting players provide somewhat important roles for both flicks.

The bad news about The To Do List, which heavily outweighs anything good about the film, is the fact that it will simply remind you of countless other teen comedies, like the pre-mentioned comedies, Superbad and American Pie.  Sure, The To Do List is chalk full of embarrassing, childish moments and sex jokes that will make for a few belly laughs - but the film focuses far too much on cheap laughs and not enough on an intelligible plot.  While popular films like American Pie or Superbad set themselves apart from the rest of the films in its genre, The To Do List doesn't DO anything new.  It's simply more of the same raunchy sexual experiences that a writer dreamed up in order to achieve these uninspiring cheap laugh.  The film's plot works fine for what it is, and at certain points, it's even charming.  But, it's simply unoriginal and features a film premise that is severely outdated and over abused.  For those that love this style of humor, sure this film is worth a view - but for everyone else, this film has the power to easily offend and remains too uninteresting for any rational person to find meaning in it.

5428303,4,B00AIBZJDY,"""The To Do List"" (2013 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Brandy (played by Audrey Plaza), who has just graduated as the valedictorian of her 1993 high school class. Brandy has been the academic overachiever but is mocked for still being a virgin. Brandy's best friends Fiona and Wnedy convince her that she needs some 'experience' before she heads off to college at Georgetown. Brandy reluctantly agrees and then runs into Rusty at a party. Rusty is the ultimate good-looking all-American hunk and Brandy has the hots for him. Meanwhile Brandy has made a list of sex activities she wants to accomplish, and her lifelong friend Cameron is 'giving her a hand'. To make ends meet, Brandy has taken a summer job as a life guard at the local pool, where Rusty and Cameron also work. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a racy movie about sex. If that sounds like it will offend you or turn you off, save yourself the trouble (and money), and check out another movie instead. But if the subject tmatter doesn't offend you, be prepared for a funny movie with lots of racy language and situations. I have to say that I found myself chuckling and laughing a lot more than I had expected, and the audience in the theatre was equally eating it up. This is the debut feature of writer-director Maggie Carey, so it's not guys who were dreaming up the script! Aubrey ""Parks and Recreation"" Plaza shines throughout as Brenda, but kudos as well to several others (and to me preciously unknown), including Alia Shawkat and Sarah Steele as Brenada's best friends, and a special mention for Scott Porter as the good-looking hunk Rusty, giving a tongue-in-cheek performance. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a stellar soundtrack from the early 90s with songs from 2 Live Crew, Naughty By Nature, Gin Blossoms, mazzy Star, the Cranberries, etc. etc. (Brendy's room has posters on the wall of Pearl Jam and also REM Green World Tour 1989, I suppose the producers couldn't get or afford the musical rights to these superstars.)

Bottom line: this is a racy but funny movie that I found even endearing in a very unexpected way, as Aubrey Plaza will charm you from start to finish. ""The To Do List"" reminds me in spirit quite a bit of ""For a Good Time, Call..."" from last year: a light-hearted sex comedy from the woman's perspective. There is a fine line between racy/funny and vulgar/off-putting, and this movie stays within that boundary that you'll smile more often than not. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati today was quite well attended for a matinee, and laughing out loud at many occasions, so this movie may have some legs on the big screen. Assuming you are not offended by the subject matter, ""The To Do List"" is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1374883200,7,2930,4.665377176015474

It had a lot of laughs, lots of sight gags and the surprising inclusion of Connie Britton and Clark Gregg.

Gregg in particular is given some great lines as he tries to control his daughter's sexuality while simultaneously trying to avoid dealing with it personally.  Britton is the level-headed mother who wants to ease her girl's introduction into adult behavior.  Both of these parts are not so subtle subplots that just make the whole story come together.

5428580,3,B00AIBZJDY,"This is one of those high-school graduation, coming-of-age films thats supposed to be funny.  The main character is Brandy Klark (played by Aubrey Plaza) a girl who takes everything seriously.  All through high school that meant studying hard to get into college while her girlfriends were more interested in dating and learning to handle social life.  Brandys parents are also so straight that one would guess perhaps they are Mormon, or from some equally conservative background (though the mother turns out to have been somewhat more adventurous in her youth than dad realized).

Anyhow suddenly Brandy becomes convinced she has to learn all about sex because after all, college is really where boys and girls start seriously dating, and shed better know what shes doing in advance.  So in her methodical way she compiles a list and starts trying to check the items off, over the course of the summer after graduation.  Half the items on the list, she doesnt even know the meaning of, and she has to look them up or have them explained to her.

Now I admitI didn't know the meaning of a few of the items eitherthough this still does not compare to the astonishing outburst of phraseology from the Indian salesman in 40 Year Old Virgina list that Ive vowed to go back to someday, watch the subtitles, write it down, and figure it all out, but I still haven't done so.

5428641,4,B00AIBZJDY,"The To Do List is the type of comedy you should NOT watch with your parents!  Wow would that ever be a mistake of gigantic unforgivable proportions, haha!  It's about Aubrey Plaza's character who's about to enter college and finds it extremely important, according to her friends approaching womanhood, to lose her virginity.  Basically Aubrey attempts to lose it but winds up in situations where she either embarrasses herself due to inexperience or does it wrong which is where the humor comes in.  She learns gradually until it's no longer the main aspect of the story and honestly I don't even know if teenagers act and talk this way.

When I was 18 yeah, of course I'd have conversations about sex with my friends and classmates, but it was always in a joking way.  Aubrey and her friends often have serious conversations which would be a little awkward if this were reality, but I suppose the awkwardness *is* what makes up most of the comedy in the To Do List  I'd like to give some examples but amazon would probably deem them inappropriate... alright one example is how Aubrey, her sister (Rachel Bilson's character- wow haven't seen her since the OC days and she hasn't changed or aged a bit) and the mother are all sitting around the kitchen table talking about the differences in pleasing circumcised or not circumcised men.  Just imagining two sisters discussing such a thing with their mother is hilarious enough, but discussing it while the father who's sitting nearby?  Now that's awesome!  These are the funniest moments for me, other than Rachel and Aubrey criticizing each other (that's what sisters do!) which happens frequently and resorts to funny name calling.

There's a ton of content that's really extreme to the point I can't share (gotta follow amazon's guidelines here!)  Basically the movie's interesting in how it jumps from tame and light-hearted one moment, to downright dirty and offensive the next without much in the way of a warning.  Aubrey's a beautiful woman and actually she's much older than the young girl she portrays in the film interestingly enough which goes to show how young she looks.  Other memorable segments include such the parents walking in on Rachel Bilson doing a man in her bedroom while the guy she's doing it with wants to shake the father's hand.  Now that's hilarious!  Aubrey getting caught doing a man in a van by her father is another classic scene.

The story is entirely focused around sexual talk, but there's no nudity to speak of.  Just really graphic language.  I never quite understood the reason why the story takes us back to 1993.  I mean it could've easily focused on the year it was released (a couple years ago) but I probably missed a crucial plot point that explained it somewhere along the line.  I mean other than Aubrey's obsession with Hillary Clinton, the year really didn't seem to matter at all.  At least a few references brought back memories for yours truly.  Anyway in addition to Aubrey experimenting her sexual appetite on different men and learning what pleases and what doesn't please them sexually, she does this without any emotion or attachment to any of them not because she's sleazy, but because she comes off so clueless all the time.  A guy has a crush on her (Johnny Simmons) even though she doesn't realize how much he actually likes her because she's busy with some other dude (make that a couple other dudes, haha).  This leads to some funny and even sincere moments (possibly the ONLY moments of sincerity).

Aubrey's acting is questionable sometimes.  I've seen her in other films that I can't remember the name of off the top of my head and she was good in those, but here she tends to act nonchalant but I wonder if it's unintentional or not.  Perhaps Rachel Bilson should have played her role instead.  Honestly Rachel looks more innocent in the eyes and personality than Aubrey does and would have been better for the virgin part.  They should've switched the two.  Otherwise, yeah, the To Do List is all about young adults doing each other, lol.  Again, Aubrey goes around not having any personal attachment to anybody quite is odd, and it's all about sexuality exploration.  I find it unusual that Rachel's character is that she's preparing for marriage and yet we never see the husband, and that she herself, despite being the older sister, often acts just as immature as Aubrey.

A movie you're probably better off watching alone or with a group of friends you feel comfortable with who can relate and not be offended by constant sexual situations and language, and certainly nobody under the age of 20 should see this.",1433376000,,4636,4.789937106918239

5428727,3,B00AIBZJDY,"This movie should have been about a teenage boy who wants to lose his virginity (and also try a lot of sexual things) before going to college. Instead, it was about a girl. Yes, the boy losing his virginity story has been done a million times. But, with a girl, the slut issue ruins it.

It was very funny, I laughed all the way through, but I also was very grossed out and shocked all the way through.
It held my attention and I couldn't wait to see how it would end.
I enjoyed that it was set in the 90s.

I did not like the ending.

There should have been a message, such as : ""Be careful about sleeping around because it can change your life or even ruin your life,""
such as :
(1) you can destroy your reputation,
(2) you could get an STD, worst of all, HIV,
(3) you could get pregnant, and you may not even know who the father is,
(4) you could play around and end up falling in love and getting a broken heart,
(5) you could break someone else's heart,
(6) you could hurt your friends or lose your friends' respect or lose your friends completely,
(7) you could lose your parents' respect, and
(8) you could live with regret later on, because you lose your virginity only once, and it should be special and memorable.

The movie did hint at these things, but it did not give the message.

It was a comedy, and if the only goal was to be funny, then it definitely was.",1419638400,,1373,4.146616541353383

There are some decent moments in this film - but like the protagonist they're still awkward and clumsy in the delivery.  Bill Hader and the gent from the Avengers ensure I don't regret spending a couple bucks, but to friends and family I'd recommend waiting until it hits netflix or the dollar bin at Shop-rite.

5429078,5,B00AIBZJDY,"For decades, movies have treated the teenage sex comedy as an exclusively boys-only subject. So it is quite refreshing to have seen this gem: a raunchy, perverted, debauched and completely hysterical sex comedy but with a girl as the lead.

So if you can't stomach the gross-out jokes, foul language and potty humor of an ""American Pie"" or ""Superbad,"" then stay far away from this one. Otherwise, I think many would find this movie even better than those two.

Besides a rollicking series of great jokes from a fantastic ensemble of quirky characters, this movie is even more intelligent and superior than expected because it wisely disobeys the traditional plot conventions of the genre. Instead of basing the heroine's emotional growth on her falling in love with a boy - a cowardly cliche that is so contrived and dishonest to sell-out the perverted lust of the hero with some corny, redemptive romance - the heart of ""The To Do List"" is rooted in the lead's relationships with friends and family. The princess who doesn't need to marry a prince, one who can be as debased as any boy... this film is indeed a bold step forward for gender equality, and people learning about pearl necklaces.

Also, Amazon says Andy Samberg is a co-star, but he is only a cameo. Bill Hader gets maybe the most screentime otherwise and is great.

Finally: bonus points if you're a child of the '90s. You will definitely enjoy the plethora of nostalgic jokes about silly throwbacks like Trapper Keepers, Hypercolors and Eddie Vedder posters.",1391558400,,1524,4.85

However, if you can get past the exterior, you can tell she has a heart. The movie is undeniably for those who aren't squeamish about sex, and has male characters who are actually good people, which was not what I expected at all. It's all about owning your sexuality and who you are, and is a great little coming of age flick with a pretty good message. (I don't recommend showing it to your kids, though). I laughed at the navet of 90s high school students--I was born in the late eighties and I can still remember what it was like before Wikipedia, so it's a great nostalgia blast, especially during the beginning credits.

Having a raunchy sex comedy with a female lead is refreshing and shows the other side of the card when all we are usually shown in the male perspective in most movies depicting the rite of passage of losing one's virginity.

Secondly, ""Female Empowerment""? The main protagonist is a narcissistic sociopath who views other human beings the way everyone else views toilet paper, as usable and disposable. If a man did exactly the same things, said exactly the same things, and had the exact same motivations and emotional detachment concerning what he had done, every woman on earth would say he was a disgusting pig. Making the lead character female doesn't make her actions any less revolting. This movie is a series of awful people using one another and never once treating one another like human beings.

So perhaps it could have slightly redeemed itself if I had forced myself to finish. But, since I view comedies to be just that - to be funny and entertaining, I refused to treat it as a root canal and as something I should ""push through"" just because I paid for it.

The lead character is painfully and offensively stereotyped as intelligent and overachieving and, therefore, correspondingly unattractive and socially inept. Further still, the attempts at humor were cheap, uncreative, and are already extremely overdone in Hollywood. I was not expecting a raunchy, have-as-much-sex-as-you-can-to-be-cool unilateral approach nor is that amusing to me. So, this is the perspective I am coming from.

This story wasn't really about a girl trying to find love, which I found refreshing!  It was funny, though some the humor might not be for everyone.

5429323,1,B00AIBZJDY,"Brutal. Simply brutal. First of all, I do like these high school coming-of-age movies even if they all are pretty cliched. The problem with this one is there are virtually no laughs in it at all. Despite a decent cast (""SNL"" vets Bill Hader and Andy Samberg, McLovin from Superbad and Tami Taylor [Connie Britton] and Jason Street from ""Friday Night Lights,"" Rachel Bilson of ""The OC"" fame, Troy from ""Community"" and Agent Coulsen from ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.""), it just tries too hard for the gross-out humor and lacks anything clever.

Basically, Easy A beat them to the punch with a better cast and script.

Throw in the odd choice to place the movie in the '90s yet a lot of it looked more like the '70s was bizarre. Seriously, most high school movies are in the now as it's teenagers who watch this fare by and large. Unless I'm missing some untapped group of people in their late 30s who want to relive the '90s?

She creates a comical ""to do"" list, most of which we never see happen. The list, and Brandy's not understanding the terms I found to be the funny part of the film. Once she starts to check things off the list, the film becomes neither funny or erotic. It attempts to be crude with stale humor.

I found Aubrey unable to pull off the role as Emma Stone did in ""An Easy A."" The ""humor"" was juvenile with adult themes and fails even as a teen sex comedy.

Might work as a low brow rental.

I think Alia Shawkat is also amazing. Yes, it's a similar plot we've seen told from the male perspective many times, but it was refreshing to watch it from the female perspective. I loved that it went there with a pretty solid sex-positive message. I was a teenager in the time this film takes place in and the little choices in set design, fashion, and the music were spot-on.

5429364,4,B00AIBZJDY,"The summer comedy sex romp. You've seen it before, although most of the ones I remember center around male protagonists. This one follows Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza) as her graduating class's valedictorian, a well-studied, bookish, painfully honest and socially stunted lady who is worried about entering college with literally no sexual experiences under her belt. So to speak.

Hoping to get a little practice before game time, Brandy drafts a To Do List containing every sexual experience she can think of, including more than a few that she doesn't understand at all (shockers and pearl necklaces, to name a few). With the help of some of her friends, as well as a comedic cast of goofballs (including the fantastic Bill Hader and Andy Samberg), she will stumble through raunchy, nutty, and nearly X-rated experiences as she makes her way to the mostly pre-packaged ending that films like this seem required to have.

In spite of its pretty basic story and foregone conclusion, the film is funny, as long as you calibrate your sense of humor to its goals. After all, this is about as low brow as comedy gets. It's right there in the title. Even though there are more than a few stock characters, nearly every actor does their best and seems to be having fun doing it, which is infectious.

Congrats to Aubrey Plaza for her first top starring role. Innately charming and classically pretty (but not so gorgeous that she's unbelievable as the inexperienced nerd), she actually carried the movie a lot better than I expected her to. However, I still didn't feel, by the film's end, that she completely sold me on her character, especially in the very few moments when the script asks her to be dramatically sincere. She's got some great (developing) comedic chops, but her ability to convey honest emotions like dismay, hopelessness, or fear still isn't up to headliner quality.

These tarnished moments in the film's acting are rare, though. Definitely the kind of film you're better off watching with a group of close friends and maybe a box of wine or two, THE TO DO LIST achieves its meager goals with all the crass aplomb that you should expect. Look for anything more than that, and be prepared to be disappointed.",1385251200,2,2221,4.836842105263158
5429365,1,B00AIBZJDY,"Really stupid, juvenile movie.  I made it 43 minutes in before turning it off forever.  The only good part was the trip back to the 90s in the opening credits.",1385164800,,159,4.266666666666667
5429366,3,B00AIBZJDY,"""Not as much of a thrill as I would have expected like Youth in Revolt, this indie comedy from writer-director Maggie Carey is pretty much a funny, fuzzy, crude, and subtly done sex comedy that takes much of the coarse vulgarity one would find in something like John Waters, Clerks, or Zack and Miri... into the world of a Judd Apatow-inspired comedy about the coming-of-age.

While nothing too special, Aubrey Plaza's performance as timid, ambitious, and feminist-leading Brandey Klark is a character that many can relate to, boys and girls, and her sexual curiosity with the film title list is a one full of gross, silly sexual acts that line up to show that she can be a ""cool kid"" before she goes to Georgetown University. However, the film does not develop much from that point and goes right into the chaos. While the sex farce gets tiring and a bit redundant (with the exception of a few interesting discussions and dialogue that could serve as a 16 year old's portal to right or mostly wrong), it is the 1990s chic and set pieces that keep the film going also with one of the most exciting (and even dirtiest) soundtracks (Pearl Jam, MC Hammer, Naughty by Nature, 2 Live Crew) to a film this year.

What sets this film different to a film that opens the discussion about sexuality is that it is knowing of its subject matter in a way like Don Jon, a much better indie comedy-drama about sexual adventures and temptation. If you like Aubrey Plaza's deadpan, hipster flair in her work, you will definitely like this film but if not, do not come in expecting a whole lot other than teenage angst and lust.""",1385164800,,1611,4.590277777777778

Not wanting to embarrass herself she comes up with a list so she can get more experience before ultimately ""losing it"" to the man of her dreams. Since the Hangover hit R rated comedies have been more and more abundant. Since American Pie and There's Something About Mary teen based comedies have been trying to one up each other and see how much more they can get away with. This one goes pretty far in terms of shock factor and is funny for most of the way through. The only real negative I can say about this is like Bridesmaids this one seemed geared more toward the female crowd. A negative to me because I am a guy. Fans of movies like Bridesmaids and The Bachelorette will really enjoy this. Overall, it was funny and I did like it but was just a little too girly for me. I give it a B.",1384646400,,1074,4.375

The key to success here is not only the nostalgic flashback to the 90's (which proves to be somewhat of a comedy gold mine), but also the screenwriting, as well as Aubrey Plaza's performance. She rarely fails to bring something new, original, and funny to the table.

The female friendships in this film are almost as fun to track as the dysfunctional lead family. Overall, it's a winning combination. Plus, the soundtrack and cinematography are consistently ahead of most recent comedic films.

It's also quite fun to watch the cameos from favorites such as Donald Glover, Andy Samberg, and Bill Hader.

Overall, this film is a hilarious 'thrill ride', though NOT for the faint of heart. I strongly recommend The To Do List to any comedy lover looking for a fresh take on an old favorite.",1380931200,14,936,4.905063291139241
5429372,4,B00AIBZJDY,"Aubrey Plaza gets her first lead role as Brandy Klark the nerdy valedictorian of her high school class.  She also wears the big ""V"" sign and wants to eliminate it before heading off to college.  So with help from her somewhat experienced two best friends, Fiona (Alia Shawkat) and Wendy (Sarah Steele) and her encyclopedia, Brandy devises a sexual to-do list.

The premise isn't necessarily new, but historically it is the guys who develop the list in raunchy films like this one.  And yes, there are plenty of descriptive sexual moves that go well past the few better known ones.  In this film, unlike some of the similar themed ones of the past, the filmmakers pull their punches when it comes to actually showing anything.  All the action is below or above the camera lens or covered in heavy blankets.  Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments but this is more a titillating comedy, than a breast-fest.

Brandy uses people she knows like her lab partner, Cameron (Johnny Simmons), to get through some of the easier tasks (the movie was originally named ""The Hand Job"") unaware that he has a big crush on her.  Her ultimate goal is to lose her virginity (and more) to the hunky, older life guard (Scott Porter) where she works.  When it comes to detailed tips, Brandy must rely on her older, slutty sister Amber (Rachel Bilson) for information.  This of course, usually comes at a price.

Connie Britton and Clark Gregg get in a few good moments as Brandy's parents.  Andy Samberg, Donald Glover and Christopher Mintz-Plasse play characters that are little more than checkmarks on the list.  Bill Hader is pretty damn funny as well as Brandy's manager at the pool.
