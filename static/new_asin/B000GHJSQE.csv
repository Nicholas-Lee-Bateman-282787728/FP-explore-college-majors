8132297,4,B000GHJSQE,"While I don't feel this 3rd volume is as great as the 1st, it is still full of really exciting lessons about life under the sea. Captain Nemo (along with Kris and Robbie) teach us more about sea life.

In episode 1, we see that the deeper we go underwater, the less colors we can see; in episode 2, we have an exciting lesson about the Hammerhead Shark. (Bloodhound of the Sea) Robbie gets into some trouble here. And just as we think the Hammerhead fails the test, he comes through and 'wins a cigar!' In episode 3, Kris has to steer them around some coral. 4 is an interesting one about theft of undersea treasures. 5 teaches us about Antarctic Krill.

(In 5 the style of comedy is underlined. Captain Nemo is telling Kris and Robbie about the dangerous Sea Leopard, and he doesn't see there is one right behind them.)

In episode 8, robbie tries to get a phoptographg of a coelacanth (a living fossil) but runs into trouble as the air is too thin and causes an intoxication effect. Episode 9 teaches us about fish farms and the huge but friendly whale shark. With the 12th episode, our heroes play detective and uncover a corrupt oil scheme.

Not only are these great lessons on sea life, they also give us comedy with just the right amount of danger and suspense.",1210118400,,1267,4.424892703862661
