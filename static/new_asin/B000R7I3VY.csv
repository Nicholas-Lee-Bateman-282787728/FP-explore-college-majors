8199125,4,B000R7I3VY,"The Happy Tree Friends are everything that make cartoons great, plus enough blood and gore to make Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, John Carpenter, and Sam Peckinpah proud.  Honestly, when a little cartoon critter gets smashed by a rock or blown up by dynamite, what do you expect would happen?  Thanks for being truthful, Mondo Media!  Also ingeneous is the almost complete lack of text (except for the titles and ""morals"" at the end) and meaningful verbal dialogue in the series (makes it very easy to export the show to overseas markets).  Volume 3 of HTF gives us nine more of the seven-minute TV series episodes.

* A Change of Heart- Disco Bear needs a heart transplant.  Will Dr. Lumpy make this operation a success?

* A Hole Lotta Love- When Cub falls down a deep hole, it's up to Sniffles' latest invention to get him out.

* Mime to Five- Mime searches for a job so he can earn money for a new unicycle.

* Blast from the Past- Sniffles takes his time machine to the distant past and teaches his ancestors how to catch ants.

* Chew Said a Mouthful- Paging Dr. Lumpy again!  This time, Nutty's sweet snack gets his jaws stuck.

* See What Develops- The Mole gets a job as a photographer, while Splendid struggles to change out of his civvies.

* Idol Curiosity- The infamous cursed Idol strikes back as Sniffles leads a jungle expedition.

* Home Is Where the Hurt Is- Handy builds a new house for Giggles, but nobody can find the way out.

* Aw Shucks- Farmer Lumpy goes to war against the crows that are after his prize ear of corn.

The creators' commentary for each of the episodes is just as hilarious as the episodes themselves; definitely play the commentary as you watch!  And of course, stay tuned for Volume 4 which should feature the episode Winging It where nervous-nelly Flaky (my favorite HTF character) has to emulate Stryker from the Airplane! movies and emergency land a jet liner.  And also the two-part final episode Double Whammy where invincible killer Flippy meets his greatest adversary:  himself!",1181520000,4,2023,4.632022471910112
