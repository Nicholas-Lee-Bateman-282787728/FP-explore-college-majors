when I found out I could get it on Amazon I jumped on it....
I don't know of anywhere else one could see this kind of action.
DVD is well made and entertaining...",1377388800,,223,3.977777777777778
8589517,5,B00D4CGZQE,"I really enjoyed watching this video. I'm a relatively new customer to Flyin Miata, and have only had my Miata for about 4 months. The video gives a little background on the Flyin Miata shop which I thought was cool. I especially enjoyed the part about crowd sources the funds for the Targa trip. That really shows you that Flying Miata are doing things right in terms of customer satisfaction.

A majority of the video details the actual Targa rally. If you've ever watched rally videos then you know what to expect, but if you haven't you'll get some really good insight into what it's like to run a Time Stage Rally. Best of all, you get to the Keith's V8 Miata tearing it up.",1374105600,,679,4.432
