8125429,5,B000FPLRQQ,"This movie apparently did quite badly in India and overseas... Can't understand it! Amitabh was fantastic - Arjun wonderful. I especially loved the ""Kung-Fu"" fight scene. The music that accompanied it was sharp, satirical, and moving - quite apt!
Loved the ending - had a real ""Bollywood"" twist to it! Loved it!",1275955200,,311,5.0
