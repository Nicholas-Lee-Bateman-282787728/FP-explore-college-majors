7992900,4,B00009RXLQ,"I really enjoyed this video, and it would have been a full 5 star experience had it not been for the teeny-tiny, Blu-ray size subtitles that I could just barely read.  Blu-ray size subtitles on a standard DVD -- COME ON PROFESSIONALS, use your brains!",1407974400,,251,4.5777777777777775
7992901,3,B00009RXLQ,"I agree with the reviews written prior to this: Moffo fans undoubtedly will want to take a look at the then talented 24 year old. Opera and TV historians will find this an interesting effort at capturing an opera for a then very small screen showing only black and white images and, usually,produced on a relatively small budget. Others, interested mostly in the pleasures the opera has to offer, will probably find their needs better fulfilled by the other DVD available, the 2004 version starring Eva Mei.
I would not want to be understood as suggesting no pleasure for the general viewer in the Moffo version. True, there is the inevitable awkwardness of all the performers and the director in dealing with a medium whose use was still little understood and whose technology little developed; most likely, despite the efforts of VAI, you will see it on a screen whose size is far beyond that of those for which the shots were framed. However, if one can tolerate sound quality beneath the minimum for which many of you have established your audio system, there is pleasure to be had in the youthful singing of Moffo and in the featured tenor. The scenic and costume design is probably closer to that customary in earlier stage productions than is the Mei version.
Withal, a valuable historical document which has some gratification to offer the average viewer.",1235606400,,1363,4.829059829059829
7992902,2,B00009RXLQ,"Apparently, in this day and age, our sound preferences have changed a lot. We look for clarity, dolby style sound, with the quality being the center piece.

I like to watch operas in my house because, although I do not have the excitment of the direct view, the sound and video are excellent. I made quite an investment into the sound and video systems that I work with. The DVD in question, does not provide the today's exigence for neither the sound or for the image. It is deplorable to watch, and it kills the beautiful Bellini's music.

It is only for the collector of music history, or for the ones that would like to have the material proof of the evolution of the recordings and their quality, during different stages of electronic discoveries, in time.",1175040000,2,761,4.588235294117647
7992903,5,B00009RXLQ,"Film is black & white and in mono featuring a very young & terrific sounding Anna Moffo.  Although it looks like a fuzzy black & white tv program - here is a wonderful chance to see Moffo possibly very early in her career.  Her singing is spectacular and at first, I did not recognize her because she had not yet blossomed into a gorgeous beauty. Don't get me wrong, she's still lovely. However, I immediately recognized that creamy voice of hers! Considering there are few recordings or even films of Moffo in the early stage of her career - this is a must have for Moffo fans. I give 5 stars for her performance. Brava La Moffo!",1172707200,8,630,4.3760683760683765
7992904,3,B00009RXLQ,"Anna Moffo's voice was a gift from God. One of those typically beautiful creamy lyric voices (in the same mould as Renee Fleming, Kiri Te Kanawa and Teresa Stich-Randall), she was born to sing Mozart, bel canto, the Villa-Lobos Bachianos Brasileiras No. 8, and more.

Even here, as a young performer at the beginning of her career, the voice is magic. She herself, although she has yet to bloom into the full physical beauty that will be hers, is extremely pretty in this filmed version of Sonnambula. But of the accomplished actress that is also to bloom... as yet there is little, if any, trace. She has a lovely smile, and a good ""I am agonised"" expression, but one really needs more than that. We know that she DID develop and become a good actress, and that her voice continued in its beauty...

However, do not think to find any well-developed acting technique in this film version of the opera. It often has a quaint charm about it, but the acting is often atrocious - by EVERYONE. The chorus are particularly culpable for very bad ""stage"" moves which are under-rehearsed and cringe-worthy. No one is fully convincing... although some are less convincing than others.

As far as the singing goes... well, it is mostly adequate. No one else matches Moffo's exquisite sound, but the Elvino is okay, the Count is better, and the Lisa sounds far too much like a tin whistle to please.

As a historical document of the young Moffo, this is well worth the price. But as a well-staged or well-sung performance of La Sonnambula - no. Get this for Moffo's voice and youthful loveliness - in that sense, you will not be disappointed.",1131235200,26,1630,4.668989547038327
7992905,4,B00009RXLQ,"Produced for Italian television in 1956, in black & white and with mono sound, this film (!!) showcases a young and very lovely Anna Moffo; probably at the beginning of her international career and most likely her first encounter with Bel Canto. Although sound and picture quality are not up to today's standard (who's surprised?) I dare call it a gem. And besides, it's the only SONNAMBULA on DVD todate. Moffo's singing is absolutely delightful and the camera loves her. Of the supporting cast I'd like to particularly mention tenor Danilo Vega and bass Plinio Clabassi. Both fine and very able singers. Bruno Bartoletti is the conductor and, among others, should be remembered for many years of excellent work at Chicago's Lyric Opera. In the tiny role of the Notary a veteran comprimario tenor: Giuseppe Nessi. In the Turandot premiere of 1926 he created the role of Pong. Finally: the picture on the case is not from SONNAMBULA. But it's Moffo alright. Enjoy!!!",1099785600,29,966,4.932515337423313
