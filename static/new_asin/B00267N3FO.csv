3853045,5,B00267N3FO,"The first REAL documentary on Metal in a LONG time.

While ""Decline of the Western Civilization Part 2"" remains the cornerstone of the topic, this show is the first to actually take a look at where metal has thrived for years and years - everywhere but the United States.  It contains very interesting feedback from people all over the world.",1365984000,,342,4.683333333333334
3853046,5,B00267N3FO,"I love this film. I don't love heavy metal but the director's first film: ""Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"" was so terrific, that I had to buy this when my local DVD shop didn't stock it. If you have not seen the first film I recommend it, seeing it first, added to the pleasure I got out of watching this one. But one of my friends who watched this with me and had not seen the other, thought this a stand-alone enjoyable piece of music documentary.

It is made by a guy who is both a headbanger and has a Masters in Anthropology. He focuses on several countries with massive metal scenes: Japan, India, Indonesia, Iran, Dubai, China, Brazil etc and he shows how, in each country, the Heavy Metal music scene has evolved according to the needs of the culture. It is completely fascinating to see the mutations of the music according the needs of place. As a filmmaker, Sam Dunn has a fantastic sense of the particularity of each culture. The taste of each country is so specific - for this alone it is worth watching. Added to this, is the music itself and how each culture has adopted it or adapted it. And then there are the fascinating personalities: the metal musicians, local and global and the wonderful fans, some of whom moved me to tears. (Yes - really!!)

I have learned so much about the scene through watching Global Metal, (and Metal A Headbangers Journey). Through them I have acquired a great respect for the Metal scene. I am still not a big Metal music fan, (although of course, I downloaded several albums after watching these films,  I don't actually play them much) but I love these films and rate them highly. I have loads of Music doco's and I think these are among the best music doco's ever made.(Yes - really!)",1355097600,2,1734,4.498412698412698
3853047,5,B00267N3FO,"This DVD is the most awesome display of photojournalism I have seen in a long time.  Shot all over the world with great scenic backdrops, it has priceless interviews and footage from so many countries across the globe.  Global Metal is a must see for any metal fan.",1349222400,5,265,4.5
3853048,5,B00267N3FO,I like this documentary better than the previous one by Sam Dunn about the history of metal. I am not a fan of metal music at all but the enthusiasm of the fans is contagious!,1343001600,2,175,4.0285714285714285
3853049,3,B00267N3FO,"If you are someone like myself who is into the scene of these places this is not the film for you. Sam picks some of the well known bands from these places. For me I was hoping he would have done more homework and put in the film some bands that where more underground to help out the scene in these places because all these places have great bands that people need to know about. If you look at the film for more of anthropological approach than it's not bad. As I said I was not looking for that. I was hoping for not so well known bands to be in this movie. Like GxSxD, SSORC, Abigail, Fenrisulf, Rusuah, etc. If you don't know the scene than this movie will be for you.",1326326400,,673,4.067669172932331

3853051,4,B00267N3FO,"I loved Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, and although this wasn't quite as good, as with the first film, I could have watched another hour or two easily. It's interesting to see different cultures interpreting metal in their own way and like Headbanger's Journey, Sam Dunn has made another great film about a still misunderstood genre of music. Can't wait until his next film. The Maiden film is fantastic as well.",1257292800,13,412,4.9

8352288,5,B00267N3FO,As a metal fan I was excited to see that this had been released on dvd. Very well done and informative.  I really never thought about other areas of the world who were into the metal scene.,1434412800,,189,4.108108108108108
8352289,4,B00267N3FO,"Another great doc from Banger Films and Sam Dunn.  We get to explore the world wide metal underground, and see how metal is changing cultures.  It moves a little slower than the first movie, Metal: A Headbangers Journey, but it's still full of great stuff and will turn you on to some new groups that you probably haven't heard of.  All I can say is, I hope Banger keeps making more of these.  I haven't been disappointed yet.",1432080000,,426,4.423076923076923
8352290,5,B00267N3FO,One of the best documenteries I've seen! Sam Dunn is a master of finding material and whom to interview. More to come!,1401840000,,118,4.409090909090909
8352291,5,B00267N3FO,"For anyone who wants to see the big picture on metal, this is an absolute must.  I wanted it to give me a perspective on how what has been associated with the British and the American working classes may have evolved around the world.  And it serves that purpose very, very well.  Can't imagine understanding metal from a broader perspective without this video.",1382486400,3,361,4.698412698412699
8352292,5,B00267N3FO,"After seeing Metal - A Headbangers Journey back in 2005, I didn't think that another movie could compare to it, but I was wrong! Global Metal is an excellent continuation of the themes explored in the original film, and it really showcases Sam Dunn's anthropology background.

Global Metal has a lot less of the history of heavy metal, and instead focuses on the history and culture of the respective country Sam is visiting, and how that has impacted the metal scene in that country. During the course of this documentary Sam visits 7 different countries: Brazil, Japan, India, China, Indonesia, Israel and Dubai. In each location Sam interviews some of the big and up and coming bands from that country, and also explores how metal has flourished there. Some of the big names are Max Cavelera of Sepultura from Brazil, Yoshiki Hayashi of X Japan from Japan, Sahil Makhija of Demonic Ressurection from India, and Kaiser Kuo of Tang Dynasty from China. There are several up and coming bands from Indonesia and Israel that are featured, and when the film comes to an end in Dubai, it is at the Desert Rock festival, the only heavy metal festival in the middle- east.

Global Metal is another excellent film from Sam Dunn and Scot McFayden, it explores metal in a new and fresh way, which makes for a very informative and entertaining movie - Definitely a must have for metal fans!!",1368144000,5,1380,4.745833333333334
