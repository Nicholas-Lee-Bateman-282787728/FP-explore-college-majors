8348870,5,B0021AVSEO,"I watched this for Kenichi Matsuyama who I had only seen play L in Death Note years ago and I was enthralled by him in this series.  I had only seen him as the very calm, cool yet intrinsically sexy detective.  In Zeni Geba, as Futaro, he showcased the entire spectrum of emotions, despair, love, happiness, mania, anger, hate, even regret, and broken beyond repair just below the surface.

I felt bad for Futaro because if his unthinkable traumatic past, because he never got the help he needed.  Sometimes it was even a bit comedic but I found it unnerving because of our main characters affiliation with murder, I felt he was going to snap at any time.  The horrific sadness he displayed was disturbing and I'm not moved very easily.  His cruelty towards people, especially near the end, left me speechless.  However, I liked watching his Machiavellian pursuit of money, all of the crazy, all of the smiles (that L lacked,) was electric.  I will certainly re-watch most of it. <3

I know my review is bias for Ken, however everyone else did very well in their parts also. After all, a person is only as threatening as the people around them are affected by them and they were all very affected.  This is a compelling human story, depressing and hard to watch at times.",1489104000,,1271,4.584070796460177

8348872,3,B0021AVSEO,"I bought this series as a fan of the actor Kenichi Mastuyama, and boy was I surprised!
The character he plays of a miserly, conniving, scarred man with a troubled past is a mile away from the quiet character of L, I was very impressed with his acting.

As far as the story goes, it's a heavy drama. The story is both intricate and harrowing, I never knew what was going to happen next, I got invested in all the characters, and cried quite a bit. But there's also some light humour thrown in to mix it up.
The ending is quite a ""blast"" too, with typical Japanese weirdness.

The only thing I was disappointed with were the subtitles.
The disk quality itself was excellent, and the subs were great through most of the series, however by the last few eps they got very lazy and even go Chinese in one episode...
But I was still able to follow the story without too much trouble.

A great Japanese drama series for fans of Kenichi, and Japanese drama in general.",1290470400,,959,4.346368715083799
8348873,4,B0021AVSEO,"I have been a big fan of Ken'ichi Matsuyama since he played L in the Death Note trilogy.  I think of him as the Japanese Johnny Depp in the sense that he seems to take a lot of chances in choosing a wide variety or roles that are often offbeat and/or oddball instead of relying on his 'pretty boy' looks.  This is an interesting series and I enjoyed watching him play a  villian.  Just the look in his eyes made me think I should not like to cross his path in a dark alley.  This is a 9 part series and the first disc was without complaint.  The second disc, however, had far inferior subtitles....I never can understand this.  Even the names of the characters were translated differently and although it wasn't impossible to follow the story, I was gravely disappointed.  I watched the second disc and later I went to YouTube to watch episodes 6-9 again with good subtitles.",1290211200,,875,4.425
8348874,5,B0021AVSEO,I loved this actor in the Death Note movies.  He has a super good acting range...this drama just drew me in by the first 10 minutes of the show.  If you get a chance to see this movie take it!  Worth every minute.,1278979200,,213,3.9069767441860463
8348875,5,B0021AVSEO,"I love Matsuyama Ken'ichi and when I saw he was in this, I had to watch it. The character he portrays is nothing like I have ever seen him play. He was so wonderful in this drama that I eventually ended up hating his character, but I did sympathize with what he went through. I'm not much for giving spoilers, but I will tell the gist of the story...abused child...grows up becoming demented adult...sort of a predictable ending, but it is well worth buying. I love it!!!",1266192000,2,471,4.425287356321839
