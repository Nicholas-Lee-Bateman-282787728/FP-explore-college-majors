2615339,1,B000GNOSFE,"Want to see a movie with the worst acting ever, shoddy production values, horrible writing, and terrible direction?  If so, 'Live Feed' is the movie for you.

This movie is a joke.  The cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves.  I really don't think I've ever seen such an amateur piece of work in my life.  This shot-on-video turd is a mess:  the characters(if you can call them ""characters"" as there is not one iota of characterization in the entire film)are annoying, the plot is pathetic, the writing is sad(one character twists her ankle somehow while taking a dump on the toilet)...ugh, there's just nothing good to say about this crapfest.

The director is a joke.  He really thinks that this film is a great piece of work.  If you shoot over to IMDB, he verbally attacks anyone who has anything negative to say about this ""film"", yet he repeatedly states he ""has no time for haters"".  He just a completely classless piece of trash.  I guess its fitting though because 'Live Feed' is a classless piece of trash too.

Skip this junker like the plague.",1194134400,3,1062,4.620320855614973
2615340,2,B000GNOSFE,"I was fooled by the high star rating and reviews here on Amazon, and I thought this was going to be a throwback to old 70's and 80' explotaion classics, but it just ended up being a low budget version of Saw with bad effects and porn-grade acting.
They just don't make tham like they used to. Maybe it's the digital cameras, maybe it's the fact that it's all been done before, or maybe directors just suck right now, I don't know and I can't put my finger on it, but I do know American Horror is in dire trouble.
If you wan't to see some real Horror made in this decade I'd recommend watching foriegn films. The Asians (especially Japanese) are putting out some amazing stuff nowadays with thought out meanings and messages with extreme elements, and Criterion is also putting out some great stuff.

I bought this movie for 5$ used, I was pretty dissapointed and I'm not sure if I will hang onto it, but it does have some decent soft-core porn stuff so maybe I'll keep it around for when I get lonely.",1191888000,4,1001,4.352941176470588

what it was...like a comic book.  But this film, is surely different.
It mixes film and video..giving it a unequal look, it gives you gore +
violence ..in a kind of sadistic way.

Let me start by saying I love the horror/gore genre, but junk like this needs to be put to an end...at some point enough has got to be enough...this ""movie"" was shot using a canon xl (at best)...apparently film was out of the question...the acting is miserable, the camera work and lighting was a joke...and the violence and gore was laughable...and I don't mean laughable like outrageous...but laughable because it is that bad...hack editing ruins every death scene...the only real gore comes in the form of various characters spitting gallons of blood after altercations...the highlight of the ""movie"" was a dude putting a melon on this dude head and then shooting a 9mm through it...as if things couldn't get any worse...these clowns didn't take the time to sync the dialogue to the lip motions...AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS...you have been warned...",1160870400,24,920,5.0130718954248366
2615347,4,B000GNOSFE,"Where to start.................softcore porn, lots of nudity and sex, lots of blood and gore and a good story to boot! This movie has the elements and ideas Hostel should have had!

Some college kids get trapped in a porn house of horrors. The killings are broadcast thru a ""Live Feed"" to the theater and all the tv's in the rooms of this porn palace.

I actually enjoyed this movie because it was crazy as hell. I thought Hostel was hyped up too much for blood and gore and violence but I thought it was pretty tame (I did love it though). This movie had some great ideas and crazy scenes (the one where the girl was being forced by gun point to eat a guys 3 piece unit if ya know what I mean), and the cannibal scene was good too.

This is a low budget flick and that's the only thing that hurts it. But like I said, the ideas they were going for were pretty twisted and well worth a look. If you gave this movie a big budget, I think it would have become a cult classic. Take Hostel and Live Feed and put em in a blender and that would be a masterpiece.

On the Unrated version of this flick, there is a short film that actually plays in the porn house in Live Feed. It's a silly little soft porn flick called ""Womb Service"". It's a film within the film, and it's corny and stuff but 1 of the chicks ain't too bad lookin!

The reason for 4 stars is because of the low budget blood and gore but it still works well though. The acting ain't all that great either but this is still a great flick. I would definitely rent or even buy this one because it will get your attention in the first couple seconds (stripper girl that shows all, shaven and everything)!!!! And with low budget blood (TONS) and one weird Chinaman with f'd up teeth!!!",1160352000,29,1739,4.17910447761194
2615348,5,B000GNOSFE,"To sum up this movie in one word, would be ""awesome""  The gore is awesome, but the acting could be better, but I'm sure none of us could do any better. If you're a fan of splatter movies, pick this one up.  You need to have it in your collection.",1160265600,13,246,3.9

8133531,3,B000GNOSFE,"I've seen better movies and I've seen much worse. I paid about 2.35 cents for this movie and it's worth every cent. It is atrocious in every way but it also has enough completely over the top messed up garbage to make it completely worth 3.00. Nudity, blood, and more nudity and blood. If you can get this movie for 4.00 or less with shipping in decent condition and like playing random stuff in the background when you are drawing or cleaning, you really can't go wrong with this movie unless you have an aversion to torture porn.

8133533,3,B000GNOSFE,"Live Feed is one REALLY NASTY movie. You know what you're getting into when you see the cover and as far as torturous horror goes this movie definitely delivers the goods (or the 'bads' depending on your point of view). Intended solely for the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' crowd it is VERY brutal! Pornographic Images of bound & gagged women cover the walls of the sleazy hotel in a menacing foreshadowing of what awaits the 'heroines'. The suspense leading up to the kills could have been dragged out longer to better effect but they seemed like they were in a hurry to get to the VERY nasty parts! The kills are quite bloody and some are actually creative (especially the one involving a poisonous snake and a glass tube) but there are no single standout moments that will likely linger in one's memory. Still, it is so well shot, edited and performed that it's hard to fault it for the subject matter alone. The butcher is a dreadful character who is as cold as they come and there are several other unsavory creeps slinking around the place that were very effective in their roles as well. The victims are the usual batch of idiots waiting to fall prey to the evil. A couple of them are obnoxious but not as bad as some horror movie victims. The only weak link in the movie's 'chain' is the dialog. At times characters say the stupidest things that nobody would say in their situations! Sometimes it is clearly intended as camp but other times it seems like wannabe 'cool' lines falling flat. This provides the window of opportunity which many haters' reviews are exploiting. However, if you've watched as many horror movies as I have you get used to bad dialog and don't allow it to taint your view of a movie in its entirety. The movie makers were obviously having fun with such grim subject matter without ruining the serious tone overall. Live Feed is mean, nasty and has a misogynistic streak for sure but if you're looking for a solid 'Hostel' fix you can do much worse than 'Live Feed'.",1260662400,,1987,4.553072625698324
8133534,2,B000GNOSFE,"Live Feed (Ryan Nicholson, 2006)

Another entry into what is becoming known, as much as I hate the term, as the torture porn genre. If it weren't for the release dates of the two movies, I'd call it an unimaginative Turistas knockoff, but it actually looks as if Turistas was an inspired take on Live Feed. Either way, the two movies cover a lot of the same ground, and no matter what aspect you look at, Turistas comes out looking a whole lot better.

You know the drill: five friends on a vacation get into serious trouble by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There's Mike (Lee Tichon, from the upcoming Rock flick The Tooth Fairy), the boneheaded jock type, and his girlfriend Sarah (Ashley Schappert), who used to be the girlfriend of the somewhat more studious, if equally clueless, Darren (Rob Scattergood), who is now engaged to Emily (Romeo Must Die's Taayla Markell). Also along for the trip is Sarah's best friend Linda (Caroline Chojnacki). One night, the five of them stop in a karaoke bar for a few drunken games of pool, and Mike spills his drink on a triad boss (Stephen Chang, whom you've seen in a number of small roles over the years), and are only saved from imminent destruction by the intercession of a friendly chap named Miles (The Butterfly Effect's Kevan Ohtsji). Unfortunately, the five of them are booked into a hotel owned by the triad...

This is absolute by-the-numbers torture porn. The entire movie runs an hour and a half, give or take. The first forty-five minutes of the movie is setup; we meet the young-and-beautifuls, meet the triad boss, meet Miles, see some ""oh, my, aren't those Asians savage beasts?"" footage. And then there's the second half of the movie, where the boorish Americans get what's coming to them, except for the inevitable survivors, and the savage Asians also get what's coming to them, and everyone dies bloodily ever after. The one place where Live Feed does attempt to stray from the path is the interjection of morality-play into the format (as is obvious by the ""boorish Americans"" and ""savage Asians"" stuff above), but then the appeal, if you can call it that, of torture porn flicks is that they are presented outside a moral sphere; this is not to say that one couldn't make a morality play out of a torture porn flick, but here it's handled with such ham-handedness and lack of subtlety that they might as well have dispensed with all the fun ways of killing people and simply hit them over and over again with mallets; after all, that's exactly what they're doing to the audience. * ",1238371200,,2561,4.65929203539823

8133537,2,B000GNOSFE,"I went into this with relatively low expectations, but not low enough i guess. i was hoping for something in the vein of Hostel. thats basically what you get, but the bugdet is so low and the plot is so sparse most people (even if your only goal in this is seeing interesting deaths) will feel like time spent watching it was a total waste.

a couple kills are pretty interesting (as if shoving a tube down her throat wasn't bad enough, they had to put that snake down it) but so poorly executed they won't phase 99% of horror fans. the camera angle keeps the most gruesome things blocked out of eyesight, this is a movie marketing itself as a Hostel knock off, i mean i wanted some kind of effects. what you do see is obviously fake.

the ""organization"" is never explained very well. they're some type of chinese mafia and they kill and eat people. why? i guess just because its fun and they taste good. how do they cover up all the disappearances? doesnt matter. how do you explain how all these people came together and just all happened to be cannibals? doesnt matter. pretty much no plot here.

this movie had some potential. could've been a really grisly, disturbing look into a psychopathic group of cannibals, but bad acting (villains are so over the top at times this feels like a cartoon), absoultely everything being poorly explained, and zero budget make it almost total waste. honestly silly at times, this movie cant be taken seriously.
