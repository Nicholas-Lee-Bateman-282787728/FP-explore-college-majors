Unitel spent $100,000 producing this and then cheaped it out by saving the $500 that it would have cost to hire a grad student to subtitle it.

8520585,3,B007PQ511U,"Marketing the Blu-ray of this Richard Strauss program from the August 2011 Salzburg Festival handed Opus Arte a big problem -- what title to give it. Christian Thielemann conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in all the music on the disc, but the presence of international star Ren&eacute;e Fleming in about a third of the concert proved too attractive a prospect to pass up. And so, the prominence of Fleming's name and the dominant photograph of her on the cover make it appear the package consists primarily of the popular American soprano's performances of Strauss lieder, with the words ""Eine Alpensinfonie"" in smaller print toward the bottom and Thielemann on the podium in the background.

Opus Arte's title difficulty doesn't help trying to find this disc on Amazon, either. If you do a search in Movies & TV for ""strauss eine alpensinfonie thielemann,"" which was my primary interest, all that comes up is the DVD issue, which is not connected with the Blu-ray listing. Do a search for ""strauss fleming,"" and again all you find is the DVD. To locate the Blu-ray, you must search under ""ren&eacute;e fleming"" or for ""ren&eacute;e fleming live in concert."" So much for sighting ""Eine Alpensinfonie.""

As it happens, Fleming's contribution is fine indeed (video and audio quality are superb throughout), but her fans and devotees of Strauss lieder will probably feel cheated that she is called on to sing only four songs and the aria from the end of Act I of Arabella. (Subtitles are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, but lyrics are not printed in the booklet. Also absent is a track listing, although ""chapters"" are accessible on-screen.) Most of the songs are short, and Fleming sings for only about 24 minutes of the disc's 84-minute running time. The highlights are ""Befreit,"" Op. 39, No. 4, the bittersweet monologue of a dying husband to his wife as he sets her free to return to the world; and the longest piece Fleming sings, ""Gesang der Apollopriesterin,"" Op. 33, No. 2, with its opulent orchestration. Fleming and Thielemann enjoy an obvious rapport. And even though I bought this primarily for the Alpine Symphony, I would like to have heard more.

Fleming's performances are oddly matched with the work for full orchestra that makes up the bulk of the disc. In a 2000 concert in the Musikverein issued on CD the following year by Deutsche Grammophon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Strauss-Eine-Alpensinfonie-Rosenkavalier-Suite-Christian-Thielemann-Wiener-Philharmoniker/dp/B00005AAFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Strauss: Eine Alpensinfonie / Rosenkavalier Suite - Christian Thielemann / Wiener Philharmoniker</a>, Thielemann and the VPO made one of the two or three best recorded performances I'd heard of my favorite Strauss orchestral composition. Unfortunately, after watching this concert with the same conductor and orchestra, I still feel the same way.

The VPO has played this work so many times, it can probably do so without a conductor. Extended passages deliver glorious sound -- especially from the VPO's justly vaunted horn section. It's terrific to see them and all the other members of this storied institution in action. The performance, however, has an air of routine about it. To be sure, a routine delivery by the VPO is nothing to scoff at. But Thielemann and the orchestra seem content to play the piece as mere ""cinema music"" -- nothing more than superficial nature painting, beautiful as that may be -- with no awareness of or reference to any underlying philosophical or spiritual program, which Strauss wrote that he had in mind as the work's foundation.

Not all of the execution is squeaky clean. In particular, the off-stage brass in ""The Ascent"" (33:40-33:50 in this recording) are really out of synch. Not only are they too distant, but also they're botched, which badly mars the listening experience. (On Thielemann's CD with the VPO, the off-stage effects are perfect.) Thielemann remains poker-faced as this minor disaster occurs, but viewers can easily imagine the thoughts running through his head. Those at the concert probably forgot about this blunder by the time the descent from the mountain was completed. For a recording, though, it's no fun to sit through again and again.

Thielemann displays one distracting mannerism on the podium. He sometimes bends forward from the waist and waves his arms down below his knees, as though he's trying to scoop the sound up off the floor. I don't think musicians beyond the first row can't tell what he's doing down there, and this recurring peculiarity becomes irritating. Apparently the Salzburg audience thought Thielemann's conducting belonged to the ages because he's brought back out so many times it's embarrassing. When he finally gets around to designating individual musicians to stand, instead of going straight to the principal horn player, it's the oboist who comes first, followed by clarinet, flute, and bassoon. Only then is the principal horn recognized. Of course, all the winds make valuable contributions, but it's the horns, after all, that form the backbone of the entire piece and sound so glorious on the summit.

The three stars are for Fleming, the VPO, and its horn section. The one on stage, that is. Now where did I leave that CD?",1407628800,4,5339,5.259389671361502
8520586,5,B007PQ511U,"Fleming has been one of the world's leading sopranos for many years. Now, at 52 (when this concert was given), she has reached the absolute pinnacle of musical achievement. She only sings 4 songs and an aria on this disc, and if that's all there were, it would be worth every cent. She has mastered the German style of singing as few if any Americans before her. I can only compare her singing these Lieder with Schwartzkopf and Janowitz and she easily holds her own in that exalted company. That she is also beautiful is almost excessive. Others have praised the Alpensinfonie which actually takes up most of this disc and I can only say I agree that this performance, with Thielemann and the Vienna orchestra, is excellent. But to me the major attraction is Fleming's ravishing performance. A wonderful show.",1375315200,2,810,4.75177304964539
8520587,5,B007PQ511U,"Check out the ovation at the very end of the ""Alpen Symphonie"" (Alpine Symphony) to get an idea of how this incredible performance went-over with the normally reserved Salzburg Festival audience. Whatever the reasons (sound quality being one of them), this live performance far exceeds the one that Thielemann made - also with the Vienna Phil. - for Deutsche Grammophon nearly a decade ago. Of course, the VPO is always on its best form when its the host orchestra of the Salzburg Fest. In addition, Thielemann's 'interpreation' (hate THAT word!) has deepened in the mean time, without also shortchanging the technicolor and cinematic moments of the work in any way (waterfalls; cowbell-laced meadows; tall Alpine peaks; mountain storms, etc.). Thus, this performance turns out to be a Mahlerian tour-de-force for all sections of the orchstra: strings, woodwinds, brass and percussion (check out the big 'wind machine', as wells as the even bigger 'thunder sheet').

This may seem like a strange comment, but this particular video is perfect for anyone interested in the nomenclature of the 'late romantic' era orchestra. Within the brass section alone, one gets closeup shots of the indigenous Viennese single F-horns (they look like natural hunting horns on steroids); Wagner tuben; bass and contrabass trombones; bass and contrabass tubas, etc. The woodwinds get quite a workout as well. All in all, this is quite fun to watch, even if there is a shortage of women in the orchestra (and I agree that there should be more). A truly stunning performance captured in excellent sound.

The Strauss songs included here are far less familiar territory for me. Other than the justly famous ""Four Last Songs"", it seems that Strauss' orchestral Lieder have taken a backseat to those of Mahler (THE best in this particular genre, in my opinion), as well as the orchestral Chansons of Ravel, Debussy, Berlioz, Duparc and other equally fine French composers. Regardless, Renee Fleming strikes me as being almost the perfect vocalist for these heady songs. While I wouldn't describe her singing as being effortless, she possess a sort of regal quality combined with a rather dark sounding timbre. While I'm no great admirer of Ms. Fleming in general, she comes across as being very much at home in this repertoire. Needless to say, Thielemann and Vienna Phil. accompany her to the manner born (how's that for Gramophone-ism?).

No, I would say that this DVD is good, if not great, for more than just the Alpine Symphony. But make no mistake, that's the main event here.",1343260800,,2559,5.059241706161138
8520588,4,B007PQ511U,"This is very fine singing and playing, but I felt there were some aspects lacking. The songs are not the most well known that Strauss wrote and are mostly very short. They have no particular link between them and might be seen as disconnected bites from the Strauss collection. Arabella is not my favourite Strauss opera by a long short and overall I found this part of the concert uninteresting despite Ms Fleming doing her best. I blame this on the selection not the performance.

The Alpine Symphony is another matter and here we get a towering performance with the Vienna brass having a field day! The different sections are identified with subtitles to aid a better understanding of the pictorial nature of the tone poem. However I must here express my disappointment that in this day and age the VPO offer almost no places for women. A lone cellist and perhaps 3 more in the back rows of the violins and violas were all I could spot and only the cellist appeared fleetingly in the close ups. The Vienna men are mostly an elderly lot and visually no great beauties. Women in other great orchestras have done much to lift the visual pleasure of the performance and seem to push the men to smarten up as well. With Blu-ray the visual side is almost as important as the playing and I found this disc visually uninspiring. The Vienna Philhamonic would greatly benefit with a massive influx of women to brighten up their very out-dated on-screen image. The Alpine Symphony is the big item here and wonderful to hear but it could have been even more attractive with a mixed orchestra.",1341964800,8,1583,4.633451957295374
8520589,5,B007PQ511U,"Renee Fleming opens this concert and is very much on top form here singing these songs exquisitely with heart-felt expression and meaning. She is also possessed of one of the best-suited Strauss soprano voices on the world stage at present and it really shows in this concert.

The opening three songs were all conceived initially without orchestra and were orchestrated later. In the case of Befreit, Strauss himself provided the orchestration 35 years later and Winterliebe was orchestrated 18 years later. The orchestration of Traum durch die Dammerung was done by Robert Heger. Renee Fleming's opening performance of 'Befreit' is especially moving but the other two songs are also finely done. The concluding song of the four chosen is the rarely performed and powerfully conceived Gesang der Apollopriesterin op. 33 /2. This is conceived on a very large and passionate scale and is operatic in impact. This song was originally conceived in full orchestral splendour and this performance is a powerful delivery by all concerned.

There follows the concluding scene from the first act of Arabella which is in the form of a monologue during which the heroine contemplates her marital options. There are two unappealing options and one attractive but little understood option. Arabella's preference for this more risky option is clearly portrayed and once more it receives a passionately excellent performance.

Thielemann has a considerable reputation for his Strauss interpretations and in this concert he is wonderfully supported by the Vienna Philharmonic which provides playing of tonal splendour coupled with technical brilliance. This concluding performance of Strauss's epic Alpine Symphony is very similar to the one he did for CD with the same orchestra issued in 2001. This interpretation, however, seems even finer to my mind and certainly benefits from the added visual effect. The additional splendour and range of the sound recording in DTS ranges from considerable delicacy to almost overpowering majesty at such peak moments as the summit and the thunderstorm. This is a piece that responds very well to surround sound and the extra capacity of Blu-ray makes the most of this spectacular score, and the playing of the orchestra which can be summarised as phenomenal.

The recording, as mentioned above, is of a very high standard to suit with crisp imaging and exceptional tonal range. The sound is clear and revealing of all the score's complexities and is presented in both DTS 5.1 surround and stereo.

This is a particularly fine disc in every way and will surely give enormous satisfaction to all purchasers. It easily supersedes the CD version of the symphony with the same conductor and orchestra. Renee Fleming's contribution sets the scene for a sumptuous musical experience.",1341619200,8,2802,5.273542600896861
8520590,5,B007PQ511U,"Whoever titled this as ""Renee Fleming in Concert"" should be arrested for major misrepresentation. She takes up only 26 minutes in a 85 minute concert. The major work here is the Richard Strauss ""Eine Alpensinfonie"", one of his better and longer tone poems, describing a trip up and down a mountain in the Alps, including getting caught in a thunderstorm. It is set in 22 sections, and is really an ode to nature. Its composition is said to have been spurred on by the death of Gustav Mahler, who wrote some very memorable and beautiful ""nature"" related music in some of his symphonies. The Alpine Symphony title appears on this blu ray cover in small print, so Unitel will only have themselves to blame if people pass this by on the Amazon site, thinking that it's wall to wall Renee Fleming (not that she's not a great soprano, just that her presence is limited on this disc). Even the songs she sings are not vintage Strauss - the ""Four Last Songs"" would have been a sounder choice, and Fleming has them in her repertoire.

Anyway - enough whining. The Alpine Symphony is expertly played, as you might expect, by the always wonderful Vienna Philharmonic under Christian Thielemann, a great combo. The orchestra is augmented for this outing to Salzburg with Wagner horns, wind machine and a large piece of sheet metal for the thunder (plus more of the regular instruments). What a mighty sound they make, and what a great recording in DTS MASTER AUDIO. This is not deep music, but it will show off your equipment, and it is entertaining.

For some reason, Amazon has this for under $18 for the blu ray on their site. I've no idea why so cheap, but take advantage now, before they change their mind. Think how many more classical music blu rays would be sold if they were priced like this, instead of north of $30. One of my pet peeves is that hours of music can be placed on a blu ray disc, but with a few notable exceptions (Four symphonies/Dausgaard and Mozart concerti/Barenboim, for example} this is not done. So either lets get 3-4 hrs. of music or cut the price to $20!

Anyway, great deal, great performances and great audio and video.",1341100800,21,2143,4.590078328981723
