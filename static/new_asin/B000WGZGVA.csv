Most of the matches try to mimic the ECW style with weapons, ringside brawls, and a fast-paced style. A couple of matches actually originated from the famous Madhouse of Extreme in Queens New York. Matches for the first program include:

-Xavier vs Red [Red is similar to X-pac]
-D-Lo vs Shane Douglas vs Johnny Swinger [3-way dance]
