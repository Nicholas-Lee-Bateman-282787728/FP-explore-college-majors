8414237,5,B00438N6P6,Loved the dvds. My only compliant is that that they go off topic a few times and it barely covers Vancouver.,1398729600,,108,4.190476190476191
8414238,1,B00438N6P6,"I was hoping to see Yuna in her best competitions from 2007 to 2010 when she was olympic champion. Instead you will get short clips of a few of those competitions and not even with music she used for those programs. it also shows how popular she is in Korea and when she did commercials. Short clips of her annual All That Skate special are also shown. and how she overcame a back injury to win her first gold medal is also shown( again, short clips).  the second dvd was completely worthless as it only showed her making commercials, dancing, etc with no Eng subs. both dvd together lasted only about an hour or a little over. I know she's ""Queen Yuna"" and the greatest female figure skater ever but it's a shame they used her name and popularity to cheat people out of $40.  Yuna is the most generous athlete ever giving money to charities every year so I can't imagine her knowingly endorsing this dvd set. she would feel guilty. it's not worth what they're charging.",1357430400,,970,4.443820224719101
8414239,5,B00438N6P6,"This film contains some footage of Yuna Kim, one of the greatest figure skaters in the human history. 2 discs include each ""Happy Skater Yuna Kim"" & ""All about Yuna Kim"". 1st one is about the career of her as the athlete, including narration by Discovery Ch. 2nd one describes the Queen as one of the powerful celebrities in Korea, no narration but fully visual rare documents. This is the must-buy item for the Yuna Kim's fans.",1305504000,3,428,4.571428571428571
