2925220,2,B000UUQG2Q,"I ordered the item, and I kind of ended up noticing how this was a bootleg. I was personally OK with that at first, I just wanted a hard copy of this stuff.
I started looking to see how bad the bootleg screen was, and I have to say, it looked really bad. The copied picture of Tai and Agumon looked really outdated in comparison to the background image. Clearly a cut and paste. I agree with the ""Play Movie"" comment in a previous review, in which I'm kind of taken aback because of it, and then the scene selection wasn't nearly as impressive as I had read about it. I also noticed the Japanese them song in the background. I understand the more authenticity that the product then would offer, but I know that some sort of official American release would not have it. I felt like the Japanese Background cheapened the product.

Then I just did a quick look at an episode, and was incredibly displeased. It may be a sensitive eye thing, but whenever something moves in a picture, I can see what seems to be some sort of pixel-like quality and it became incredibly distracting within the first 10 seconds. And it turned out that it would do the same thing no matter how small the video was.

Another thing I noticed was that the ends of episodes don't seem to have a real definitive ending. In other series boxes I've watched, each episode would play the theme song at the beginning and credits at the end. And the names of the episodes are obviously edited in. They have a basic scheme correct, but they are not the official ones. Makes me sad.

The only real redeeming quality of this product is its box-work. It's really well done, and I was impressed.",1326067200,,1654,4.398692810457517

I loved it when I was a kid and it was awesome to be able to order and buy it myself.  It's an easy show to follow and a great show for anyone, no matter what age.  Only 54 episodes so it's not that long of a show.

I love the show and all, but I agree with a lot of what others are saying about the boxset.  The title screen is really lazy and there are some sound problems with a few episodes, as well as a few parts where the animation freezes.  It does seem like a bootleg.  There are parts where characters are talking and someone else's voice is coming out.

Regardless, I love the show and am happy to have it.",1325980800,,719,3.8698630136986303

2925223,5,B000UUQG2Q,"Alright boys and girls, it's time to stop complaining and face the facts. Disney will NEVER ever ever ever ever release this on video and that's just the way it is. If they ever expire on their rights to it, by then no other company will care enough to release this to the less than 100 fans that still care by then. And in the future everything will start turning into digital distribution anyways. Us diehards of the ""dubbed version"" will never get an official release.

This may not be official, but saying bootleg is way too dirty of a word for this release. It's not like some guy starting making these out of his basement. These are quite nice and a company whether they are somewhat small or not, has made these. The cases are beautiful. I own tons of official box sets of other movies and shows, and quite a few  aren't even up to the quality of this. The menu isn't great, butt the video quality ain't too bad. I watch these on my ps3 and they look and sound great. I was able to get these at about 70 bucks a piece and for any diehard like myself you should have no reason to complain. You want to whine to someone, then go to Disny and do it, not like they will listen though.

Anyways, if you are a diehard of the show don't listen to thro one stat reviews whining about bootleg. Get these because they are worth it.",1312588800,,1328,4.2204724409448815
2925224,3,B000UUQG2Q,"NOTE: This review is the same as the original Digimon: Season 1 DVD review shown here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Digimon-Season-1/dp/B00005221P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Digimon - Season 1</a>

Ever since Digimon: Digital Monsters aired on the now-defunct FOX KIDS Network back in 1999, some people have dismissed it as a hopeless clone of Pokmon. But those who have done their research would know that in actuality the entire Digimon franchise was created BEFORE the Pokmon franchise. It's just that the TV shows made it all look as if it was vice versa, since Pokmon aired just one year before Digimon. Now, I was never a fan of this Japanese ""monster"" craze, but there was something intriguing about Digimon: Digital Monsters. As a matter of fact, compared to most animated kid's shows these days, this one is actually really good.

It's time for Summer Camp, and seven young kids are about to get more than they expect during this time of year. They are somehow transported into another world, where they discover little creatures that evolve into larger beasts whenever there's danger. Seems like a simple premise, but later on in the series it becomes more complicated than usual. Even if it is a clich that we've seen many times before (humans find themselves in a different fantastical world), the plot actually progresses as it steadily moves along. It's such an unusual find in kid shows these days, and Digimon is fairly unique in that it has some true plot development from beginning to end. The first thirteen episodes do look like they're intended for kids, but the second half of the first season look as if they're more for adolescents (same goes for the second season). Another thing I should add is that the show is scarcely formulaic. Each episode doesn't repeat itself with just one structure (unlike Pokmon or Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, where many of their episodes actually look and feel the same). Granted, the digital monsters do ""digivolve"" somewhere near the end, but still the episodes don't feel like they've been rehashed over and over.

But Digimon doesn't only succeed with plot development. I'm going to be perfectly clear about this: this animated series has some of the most interesting and realistic characters I have ever seen. I am serious: the human characters (Tai, Sora, Matt, Joe, etc.) are what make this show. Even though they're only kids, they do seem to have some unique qualities about them. Their distinctive personalities are what make them fascinating: Tai as the determined but sometimes foolish leader, Sora as the kind and caring tomboy, Matt as the silent lone wolf, Izzy as the clever computer geek, Mimi as the sweet but prissy girly girl, Joe as the no-nonsense ""voice of reason,"" and T.K. as Matt's positive younger brother. In the second season, you have Davis, Yolei, Cody, and Ken, and while they aren't as interesting as the characters in the first season, they are still pretty likeable in some corners. In addition to their distinctive personalities, these sorts of characters are closer to reality than we think: for example, Izzy the computer whiz discovers that he's actually adopted, and that his foster parents have kept it secret for so long. In fact, every one of these kids has their issues (Tai's overprotection over his younger sister Kari, Matt and T.K.'s parents divorced, Joe being forced to become a doctor due to tradition. These issues become a part of some of the conflicts between these characters, and therefore there's a lot of tension in the second half of the first and second seasons when the tone of the show starts to become much darker. These sorts of character developments are what I found so refreshing about this animated kid show: it features troubled characters, differing morals, and hard-hitting realism. This sort of thing is now unfortunately rare these days (watch Total Drama Island, and you'll see what I mean), but thankfully Digimon: Digital Monster is a constant reminder that you CAN do wonders with both character development & plot development.

Unfortunately, Digimon: Digital Monsters is not perfect: it has some obvious flaws that one can detect if they only use their eyes and ears. First, the animation in this show is simply awful. In some scenes, you have backgrounds that look only partially complete. In other scenes, freeze-frame is used when an object or a character is moving from one direction to another. Maybe it's because the budget for this show was limited, but whatever the reason, ""unsatisfactory"" is the perfect word I would choose for the animation. Second, the music isn't really anything that's special. You have the infamous theme that's played during the intro, and it's bad. I mean, really, REALLY bad. It's a dreadful aggravation to the ears. The male voices for the lyrics are really agonizing to listen to, and the orchestral music in the entire series (synthesized, obviously) is incredibly mediocre. The rock songs (""Runaround"" & ""Here we Go"") are pretty decent for kids, though. Finally, the screenplays for the show aren't entirely unbearable, but they can be laughable at times (even for a kids show). One-liners and puns become constant, and it can be a bit of a pain as the show progresses. Some of them are indeed funny, but most are overdone.

By the way, do these monsters always have to have ""mon"" at the end of their names? It seems unnecessary.....

In the end, however, I still have a soft spot for this show. Even though the animation and the music do not hold up very well, the plot and the characters are what make this show. Rarely does an animated series that's intended for kids convey real character development & story progression, and this one really delivers both. Unfortunately, the show fails with continuity, as the third and fourth seasons were so drastically different that most of the fans stopped caring. This would lead to the show's cancellation, as well as a reboot that started just a few years ago. I've never seen the newer seasons since the cancellation, but if it's good enough, it'll restore hope in the entire franchise. And hopefully, the official DVD release of the first and second seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters will be released sometime in the near future (complete with uncut episodes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, storyboard comparisons, etc.).

In short, Digimon: Digital Monsters fails with its poor animation, irritating music, and (sometimes) unintentionally laughable dialogue, but succeeds with its solid plot and intriguing characters.

2925225,4,B000UUQG2Q,"Yes, these are bootlegs, but the only thing that gives it away is the japanese video. In the latter episodes the Digimon Analyser is in all japanese, obvious give away.

Many people will complain about the video quality, these people really need to get with the times and upgrade. I have a Samsung LED 40""  with a Samsung Blueray Player. ya that's overkill... really just get a decent upconverting dvd player and these episodes look great. the main complaint is that the mouths and fast movement make a funky line effect. this is caused by interlacing. you see all episodes are 480i (all dvds for that matter as well) but when you convert to 1080p or even 480p your dvd player will deinterlace the frames and your picture will be fine.",1265587200,2,735,4.603053435114504

KICK-F****NG-ASS
i have been reading the other comments
i don't know why they are saying it blurs and freezes
mine doesn't  AT ALL
it could be because i bought it on toonjunkie, or their dvd's were messed up
but i just recently bought the second season on amazon, so i'll see if it's a website thing
also theres this guy who commented on the third and fourth season sets that after a month they stop working
if anyone has the third and fourth season, and have been watching them for a month or two and they still work please tell me
and if they don't, then tell me that please
NOW THE REVIEW:Now first off, about the bootleg thing, i don't know if it is a bootleg or just unnoficial, but i will however say that it is however released by an official company,not some guy who has no life
alliance entertainment is the top head of the multimedia buiseness, so if anything these dvds are NOT bootlegs, just probably unnoficial
you fans, just be happy digimon is released on dvd at all, the episdoes are uncut (kinda) and they have excellent quality along with no pesky, uneeded tv station logos or pop-ups (man i hate those!!!)
So in conclusion i recommend these to any and all digimon fans
just don't buy all them before i do,otherwise i'll get angry, and you won't like me when i'm angry, i know Lou Furignou god-dammit",1265414400,,1351,4.404
2925227,4,B000UUQG2Q,"I got my copy of this today, and yes, I agree with all the reviews, this seems bootlegged. The sound quality is good, but you have to turn your tv up to hear it. The text is all in jap with translations to the side. I saw a few reviews saying the titles looked photoshopped in but the ones I got look like they belong there.

I saw one review that said to get this from ToonJunkies. Mine was from there. Though the shipping adress on here says Denmark or something like that mine was shipped from TookJunki, Chino Hills,, California.

There are also posts of it playing, not playing, and skipping. So far, there has been no skipping or defects. I'm watching it on my 360, so it could just be that it's a better player or something, I don't know.

This is a good box set though. If you like Anime, you surely won't mind the Jap text. If you like Digimon, you surely won't wanna miss this. But, the price is a bit high, and I wouldn't waste the money on the express shipping.

-Edit-

Around the Etamon series, there are a few voice glitches I noticed. Tai talks, but Sora's voice comes out. And when it shows the kids waiting for Tai and Sora it shows T.K. talking but you hear Sora talking to Biyomon when Sora is still tied up and being coppied by Datamon.

Also, come on. There is no Aliance Entertainment Corporation.

[...]

If it were real, there would WAY more stuff on that page, even if it had integrated into a different company or anything!

For those of you who say there has never been a release though, you LIE!!! Bandai actually did release a 9 disk set in Japan. Still, I'm up to disk 4 now and other than the audio glitch, I haven't had any problem.

2925228,3,B000UUQG2Q,"Digimon is one of my all time favourite shows, so to see this available, it felt too good to be true.
Well yes, and no.

I'm satisfied with my purchase, but despite what many of the reviewers are saying, THIS IS A BOOTLEG.
Before this boxset was available on amazon, I had downloaded torrents of Digimon, and my torrent uploads are clearer and better quality than this boxset. Like a reviewer said before me, everytime someone moves, the motion is blurred. And the menu set up is painfully lazy.

I'm not sure what all this talk about a Canadian import is either. Like, really? Are there people out there that are silly enough to believe that? I bet the people who believe that are also wiring money to princesses in third world countries as well. It's a sham, but a well made sham, that will most likely satisfy none the less.

But I have to say, this is the fanciest bootleg I've ever seen. It looks so real on the outside.
I say it's worth the money anyway. The quality may not be perfect, but atleast you'll have the entire collection on dvd.

I hope the real owners to the rights of Digimon release an official boxset someday. That would be a dream come true.

If anything, please, please, please believe me when I say this is a bootleg, before you consider paying for it.",1260144000,91,1277,4.417021276595745
2925229,5,B000UUQG2Q,"Yes, this is a bootleg. But that makes it seem like it's sold out of a truck in an alley somewhere. Instead I propose we call this an unofficial release. The box art and construction are top quality and the discs are perfect and pretty to look at. In fact, it wasn't until I saw a one-star negative review of the product that I realized it was a ""bootleg"". I watched an eighteen-hour marathon of the season and there was not so much as a hiccup. So if the presentation is top quality, the discs work perfectly and it a seasoned TV on DVD collector (That would be me) can be fooled by it, why shouldn't we accept this as the release that Disney never gave us? My only complaint is that the second season is not currently available. Alliance Entertainment should do something about that. And there's no extras, but with fifty-four episode, extras really aren't needed.

In terms of story, Digimon has one of the best. I first watched the series in 1999, when the series first aired, and let me tell you it still stands up today. There is more emotion, action and intrigue than almost any other cartoon show there is. The seven children, later joined by an eighth, journey across a foreign land with their new companions trying to find a way home and then trying save both their world and the digital one they have now come to see as a second home. It's a story of personal growth and friendship. The jokes are a little corny, but come on, it was 1999. There were a lot of corny jokes back then.

I highly recommend the collection if you watched the season when it aired or if you just want a fun show that the whole family can enjoy. And I don't mean that in a corny, salesman way. i mean that in a ""I'm an older brother who watched it with his younger brother and parents"" way. Trust me. It's worth your time.",1257638400,2,1808,4.314705882352941

It is most definitely a bootleg.

I don't know if it is worth [...] bucks, but it looks decent on my older, early 2000's TV.  Buy only if you are feeling really nostalgic.  Again, it's a bootleg, and the quality is decent, but don't buy unless you really want to watch the show.",1257120000,2,660,4.290322580645161

Granted, the description says it's a ""Limited Edition Collectors"" set, the box does not say this; nor, do I know how many copies were made. You could ask Alliance Entertainment, they're the ones who make the Digimon Box Sets. Don't let my rant on scalpers detour you from purchasing any of the Digimon Box Sets. If you are as much of a fan as I, you'll get this, regardless of scalpers.

This is NOT a bootleg, or illegal copy. The quality of the Box and the video is top notch. All of the episodes for the season in one convenient box set. The episodes are at least as good as when you saw them on TV. It doesn't look like they changed anything from the Original American release footage. Special features include comercials, as seen during the original airing on TV. I would've liked more special features, commentary, deleted scenes (I've read that the original Japanese footage was cut by hours to fit a PG rating).

The Digimon series is not copying Pokemon. Pokemon's episodes are simple one episode stories that have little involvement with other episodes.

2925236,4,B000UUQG2Q,"I wanted Digimon Adventure 01 and I got it. I could care less about bonus features, and I don't mind that the video is of the japanese version with english dub, who cares about a slight difference on the digi-analyser shots? It might only be a bit confusing when non-hardcore fans read Tailmon instead of Gatomon but it doesn't really matter. Someone mentioned the quality, but I don't really notice.
I'm pretty sure it's a bootleg, the menu is weird (play movie?) but since there are no official releases, I don't feel very bad about it.
My only gripe is that I would have liked Japanese dialouge with subs, but I personally did want the dub more. If you want the sub, youll have to look elsewhere, I'm still looking. Also, it would have been nice to feature the movies especially in adventure 02's case (I really don't want to write a separate review XD) because Revenge of Dioboromon isn't available on DVD, even in a completely bastardized way (Thanks for Digimon:The Movie Saban!) But seeing as the episodes aren't in japanese, It would fit strangely to include the movies that way. Still, the dub of Revenge should have been in the 02 box set.
Adventure 02 looks like it fixed some weird thing like the menu. Thats all I saw just cause I'm not done with 01 yet, and wanted to peek.
Overall, the focal point of any tricked out Digimon box set is present here-the episodes. So it is definatley worth buying if you are a digifreak like me.",1235001600,,1442,4.528735632183908

The limited screen select is all right, the episodes flow into one another and i can read the episode titles fast enough so i know where I'm at. At first I didn't realize that it has a scene select but it turns out it does as long as you want to start at the beginning of an episode.

2925241,3,B000UUQG2Q,"When I first saw this, I bought it without hesitation.  I was a huge fan of the digimon series and was waiting a long time for a full season release.  All 54 episodes from the first season are present.  The outside packaging is eye-appealing as well.

Now onto the bad.  My first gripe is the menu screen.  I have 2 options: Play movie (movie huh?) or scene selection.  If you choose scene selection (which I can only assume is an episode selection), small circles playing short clips from the episode appear.  Besides the small clip, you have no other way of knowing if it is the episode you want.  They are not titled and are numbered 1-9 on each disc, leaving you only to reference the actual box set to figure out what episode you want to watch.  Not very convenient and only a little bit of effort would have solved this.

My second problem is the video quality.  Now, I do not know if this happened in translation, or was always there but I just did not notice due to the quality of cable TV, but any moment when there is actual movement on the screen (or when the frame changes), you get a slight fuzzy look at that part.  For example, if a character moves his mouth, his mouth becomes fuzzy.  Slowing down and freezing this frame by frame, it seems like it meshes the image of the current and previous frame in alternating bars.  It really bothered me to know they messed this up.  I endured, and got used to it after 9 or so episodes.

I love the series, and I saw that season 2 was recently released.  As much as I want the content, I am hesitating to buy season 2 based off of the way season 1 was presented.  Buyer beware.",1217203200,20,1634,4.263843648208469
2925242,4,B000UUQG2Q,"I was pretty curious about this release, and once I picked it up, realized immediately it was a bootleg. A high quality bootleg, but a bootleg nonetheless.

Whoever made this did a great job. Superb looking box, sort of a clamshell look to it with the discs folding out. Menus feature karaoke versions of Japanese insert music and are a bit awkward to navigate, but fairly professional-looking.

Now, why's it clearly a bootleg? For one, the video footage is of the Japanese version, with all the Digimon analyzer screens and such in Japanese. The episode titles and ""To be continued"" texts are digitally inserted by whoever made it, since the Japanese version didn't have those at beginning and end of their episodes, at least not on the video footage. Finally, while scenes that were cut from the English version are once again removed here, all digital paint is gone. For example, the scene where Puppetmon and TK play ""hide and seek"" has the English dialogue with the edited scenes of Puppetmon shooting at things taken out, but his gun still intact in scenes where Saban painted it over. It's pretty awkward, but doesn't detract from the show, at least not for me.

So yeah, that's it. A high quality attempt at Digimon's complete 54-episode first ""season"". If you can get past the fact that the episodes are simply Japanese footage with English dialogue overlayed (which non-hardcore fans probably wouldn't even notice very much), you have a great release. Hopefully someday we'll have an ""official"" release of Digimon ""seasons"", but with Disney just sitting on the rights, I don't see it happening anytime soon.",1214352000,,1618,4.91941391941392
2925243,5,B000UUQG2Q,"i have recently got my copy of this dvd,and when people say its bootleg and not canada import there lying it is from canada and the discs were clean and it was in perfect condition it contains all 54 episodes of the originial digimon series,... absolutley brilliant :-)",1203984000,,269,4.625
2925244,4,B000UUQG2Q,"When I found the Digimon on DVD, I bought almost without hesitation. The only reason I hesitated was because I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money at the time. But I knew that if I didn't, I would have problems finding the whole first season, let alone in one box set.

The only reason I'm giving it 4-stars and not 5 could actually be because I might not remember the show as well as I thought. The thing I'm talking about is in some of the later episodes, the digimon ID thing that comes up when the kids meet a new digimon was different from the rest of season and all the words were in Japanese. This very well could be just me not remembering that that was the way in the show.",1195257600,2,686,4.0814814814814815
2925245,1,B000UUQG2Q,"I think that's exactly what's going on here.  All the positive reviews sound too manufactured and the same.  They're review history for the most part only include this one box set; along with the fact that the item is only available as one used and the only other places I can find anything about this set is on similar used item markets Ebay and MSN.  I was estatic when I saw there was a box set, but now I'm not too sure.  Anyways, I wouldn't buy a used box-set of anything with out some VERY hard proof. Sorry but I'm going to have to give it a 1.",1192579200,6,551,4.074074074074074
2925246,5,B000UUQG2Q,"I know that for the longest time I have been looking for this set.  It was imposible to find, and I can't begin to explain how happy I was to receive this in the mail.  I have now watched all of the disks, and yes it's all there.  If you are wondering whether you should by this or not, the answer is YES!  If you love Digimon, then this is a must.  It was awesome to go back and watch the episodes I haven't been able to see in years.  The only con is that it does not work well on some DVD players.  I ran into some problems on my first, moved to my second where the problems didn't exist at first, but then it glitched a couple of times.  The glitches can be worked around, and I do not believe that it is a problem with the disks.  But if you do buy this it may require a newer DVD player.

So, buy it!  And love it.",1192233600,5,820,3.7928994082840237
2925247,5,B000UUQG2Q,"I think I speak for all Digimon fans when I say that this collection was long overdue. After being left hanging from the old release that featured only 13 random episdes of Season 1, many (such as myself) were beginning to lose hope. Thankfully all our prayers have been answered! All 54 episodes have finally been released on dvd. If that wasn't enough, the set is graced with a robust and sleek collector's case. The 6 discs are contained inside a fold out panel with the episodes titles on the side. The actual content (video & audio) is superb...even better than the old release years ago. If I had to nitpick on the set, it would be that no extras were included..but oh well..i'll gladly trade some dated digi-bloopers for the entire season.

If you have any remote interest in Digimon, this collection is an absolute must.",1188259200,3,828,4.63265306122449
2925248,5,B000UUQG2Q,"First of all, Digimon is not a Pokemon rip-off.  Digimon has a more deeper story line.  All of the episodes progress chronologically and smoothly.  The writing for the series is top-notch as well.  You can easily tell that a lot of character development takes place on this show.

If you are a fan of Digimon, but haven't seen Season 1 yet, I strongly recommend you to buy this DVD set.  Season 1 is by far the greatest season of Digimon. More studios need to adopt this policy of releasing an entire season of a series instead of individual volumes.",1188172800,5,550,4.505050505050505

I really hope Amazon implements a policy that ONLY allows reviewers who ACTUALLY purchase a product to review it...the review process is to help & inform ^_^  *gets off soapbox*

Ok, now about this set.  First of all, I purchased other Digimon DVDs before, even homemade ones  on eBay (yipes! I know)  This set is anything but a homemade set.  Once you actually get and view the case, you'll be amazed.  Trust me, you will.  The case is by far the best case I have out all of the 80's toons and anime I own.  Needless to say, it certainly stands out on my shelf =P  The set comes with 6 total discs that cotain 9 episodes each for a total of 54 (The complete 1st Season).  The video & sound quality is perfect.  If you are fan of Digimon (like me) or even find the series remotely interesting, then you have to pick this up. Hopefully other seasons of Digimon will make it out to DVD as well.",1188086400,12,1810,6.804347826086956

8214873,5,B000UUQG2Q,"Every episode has great quality video and audio (unlike the season 2 box set!). When I saw the quality of the episodes on these discs and the discs themselves, I didn't believe that they could possibly be bootleg (I still have a small amount of hope that they aren't!). There are a handful of small things that tell you that this is probably bootleg though, but I am not going to waste space listing them because they were such good quality.

The box is one of the best series box sets I have ever seen, and this time I am strictly talking about the box itself. I have seen box sets where all the discs are just sitting on top of one another on a spindle and the inside is all plain black plastic, and that was just terrible and ugly, but this one spreads them out in an attractive and practical way. They are even nice enough to list every episode title inside the box.

Whether or not this box set is a bootleg is beside the point. All that you need to know is that this box set has great packaging, and good quality videos (and audio) to back it up; so I highly recommend this Digimon Season 1 box set.

The other box sets, however, don't seem to have the quality consistency as this one, so don't let the fact that this box set was good determine whether or not you buy one of the others.",1327276800,,1292,4.180722891566265
