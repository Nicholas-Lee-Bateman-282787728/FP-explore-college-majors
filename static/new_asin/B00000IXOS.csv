8194850,2,B00000IXOS,"I ordered this disk in large part due to the other recommendations on amazon about this DVD . That said , this disk  has very poor sound  quality compared to my other DVD's . I can't say that the performances are bad , but the camera work is jerky and the  sound quality is on par with  regular TV. I would not recommend this DVD if sound quality is important to you.",1085097600,,367,4.055555555555555
