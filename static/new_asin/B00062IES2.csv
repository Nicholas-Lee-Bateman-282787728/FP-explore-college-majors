8037278,3,B00062IES2,Eh its Ok it has a good Car Crash in it but i would go for something else a little better.,1386547200,,90,3.3333333333333335
8037279,2,B00062IES2,I wasn't all that impressed by the movie in ANY aspect/ I'm not sure I'd even bother keeping it or seeing it again.,1356912000,,115,4.043478260869565
8037280,1,B00062IES2,"Personally, I like the old New Line movie, ""The Hidden"". Sure, it's a little on the goofy side, but it's a guilty pleasure. There was a part of me that believed that, with all the remakes that are being done now, that it was only a matter of time before The Hidden would get remade at New Line. Probably with Ashton Kutcher as the alien. I was bracing myself for that news when I happened upon Endangered Species.

Well, it looks like somebody beat New Line to the punch.

I haven't seen anyone rip off a movie so directly since J.T. Petty tried to pass off his ""Rear Window inspired"" Mimic 3 as something original. ""Endangered Species"" marks a new career low for Eric Roberts and John Rhys- Davies. Do yourself a favor, skip over this one and buy yourself a copy of ""The Hidden"" instead.",1109635200,4,788,4.390410958904109
8037281,3,B00062IES2,"Eric Roberts is a cop assigned to investigate a massacre at a health spa. Little does he know, the killer is a hunter from another planet, looking for perfect human bodies. Arnold Vosloo is a game warden who studies humans in their natural habitat. The hunting of humans is illegal, so the game warden teams up with Eric Roberts to bring the poacher to justice.

  Writer/Director Kevin Tenney does a good job with a low budget in creating an interesting work of science fiction. Fans of T&A should enjoy the shower scene 7 minutes into the movie, and fans of low budget SciFi effects will enjoy this movie as well.",1104364800,5,615,4.572727272727272
