8388426,5,B0034KX5PA,"This was a very good movie.  It has downplayed the suffering a bit much, but that can be forgiven as necessary to present this subject matter without making the audience feel sick.  The narrative moves along steadily and never drags.  Filming on historical location gave a feeling of realism.

If considering showing this movie to children, be advised that it depicts some physical violence, other human suffering, and male nudity.  This may be acceptable as it also depicts real-world historical events and characters showing great resolve, resilience, commitment, and solidarity.",1519171200,,581,5.411111111111111
