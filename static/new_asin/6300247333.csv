265803,3,6300247333,"Firstly i wanna say that, this film is the worst omen film in this series. Not too much action,not too much horror and not too much tension. This film is not to include these things. So i cant see a watchable film in the middle. This film has a few disadvantages. First one is the casts. The cast's r good but scenario's defiencies r crushing their performances in this film. And the second one is places. The places can not give a horror film tune. So that s a very big defiency in a horror film. Only the advantage is;this film carry a big name(OMEN)",981763200,,552,4.266666666666667
265804,3,6300247333,As a fan or the Omen trilogy the last one I thought fell a little flat.  Sam Neil does a good job as Damien and there are some creepy scenes but the film never realizes it's potential.  The whole movie the characters discuss the final confrontation between Damien and Christ and there really is none to speak of.,972777600,,312,4.362068965517241
265805,1,6300247333,"If this film is to be believed, the final battle between good and evil,  the antichrist vs. the son of god, will entail people sitting in offices,  yakking away, or occasionally making vague and ambiguous taunts to  crucifixes. Oh, and there'll be a fox hunt and some angry beagles, and poor  TV set safety standards. Does this send chills up your spine? Of course  not.
This final chapter (aside from a TV movie, which is really  spin-off) in a horror series that started so auspiciously and so  atmospherically, is cheap and incredibly dull. The plot is a meandering  series of mind-numbingly boring scenes, none of which generate any suspense  or even seem to fit together. There is no sense of eternal conflict or the  fate of the world possibly hanging in the balance. There aren't even any  creative, fun death scenes like in the first two.
Neill is remarkably  bland as the antichrist, but the script never makes him any more than a  somewhat unethical businessman (even ordering his hypnotized but  dull-as-dishwater followers to murder infants doesn't come across as  particularly evil). Goldsmith's score is spectacular, but it only reminds  you how little is actually occurring on screen. Ultimately, The Final  Conflict is just a fish out of water, weakly struggling until it runs out  of air and dies entirely. A complete waste of time and money on a subject  that deserved a true epic treatment. Only bother with this if you liked the  first two Omen films.
The DVD provides one extra: commentary from  director Baker (Alien Nation). He's about as exciting as the movie.",969235200,13,1584,4.879699248120301
265806,3,6300247333,"This third(and final, before the abysmal ""Omen IV"") entry in the ""Omen"" series is not nearly as scary as its two predecessors.  The conflict of the title comes across as rather flat and uninteresting.  What should have been a titanic battle between the forces of evil and the  powers of good is instead an entertaining and mildly creepy time-waster.  Sam Neil is excellent as the adult Damien.  He oozes an icy charm while  still projecting an aura of dark foreboding.  He is thouroughly convincing  as the Antichrist.  The other actors turn in good performances, especially  Rossano Brazzi as Father DeCarlo, the leader of a group of monks whose aim  it is to destroy the son of Satan.  Once again, Jerry Goldsmith turns in a  soundtrack that will send shivers up your spine.  Though a comedown from  previous entries, this is still a good horror flick.",963792000,3,854,4.793103448275862
265807,4,6300247333,I saw this film back in 1983.  It was one of the most frightening horror movies i've ever seen.  I remember chills up and down my spine.  Sam Neill plays the diabolical lead role very well.  He's evil and cunning as the  devil itself.,961891200,2,234,4.2272727272727275
265808,2,6300247333,"Although I liked the Omen and it's first sequel, I didn't like this one.  Although many saw it as a good completion to the trilogy (which wasn't the case with Omen 4) I grew tired of it.  This film relied more on religion  than horror. Sam Neill is well cast as Damien as battle of heaven of hell  clash but I found it tedious, I couldn't understand the boring storyline of  Judgement Day and Christ and the Devil.  I never was a religious follower  in the first place.  The film has a clever plot, but that's all really.  It  didn't hold my attention for too long.",957398400,,565,4.245283018867925
265809,3,6300247333,"In comparison to ""The Omen"" and ""Damien - Omen II"", The Final Conflict is rather weak. It doesn't bring the mounting tension of the earlier films to the satisfactory conclusion one would expect, and Sam  Neill's portrayal sometimes lacks a certain intensity. As a horror/thriller  film, it's not particularly successful either. The horrific elements are  restricted to a handful of scenes and the characters (Dean, Kate, the  priests who assist Father DeCarlo in his hunt for Damien) aren't always  fleshed out the way they should be. But there are some nice touches, like  Damien's monologue in his dark ""chapel"" and the grand foxhunt  sequence. Jerry Goldmith's score is an interesting mixture of bombast and  subtlety. And Rossano Brazzi is always enjoyable to watch.
I found the  ending awkward and somewhat muddled, and contradictory to key plot points  made in the previous films (notably, the importance of having all 7 daggers  when trying to destroy Damien) but the film is worth at least a viewing.",956102400,11,1008,5.085365853658536
265810,4,6300247333,"Omen 3: The Final Conflict is a good ending to the series and is a pretty good sequel. The only problem is that unlike the other too, Damien is too mean, you really don't want to follow him, and the other character we'd  noramlly turn to for someone to root for are paperthin and it's impoosible  to care about them. I really got turned off when Damien demanded that all  the babies be killed. But the ending is good and a suprise cameo .",937440000,2,438,4.190476190476191

Am very glad I bought this last Omen movie of the three original movies that accurately tie into the full story of the theme being presented.

Case in point, when ""the Nazarene"" appears at the end, all gauzy and glowing, im saying, ""Why did he have to go all Herod/ Metallica on the UK and kill all the male babies born in the same day?"" Being the antichrist he certainly must know that Christ (as it reminds in on screen font) returns as King and not as an infant. And why all those knives from Megheto, if one stab-and-remove from some English tart did the trick. Sam Neill is always fun to watch with his twinkling wink. However this time I wasn't charmed. I felt bad for both him and the audience. Watch the tv show Damien instead.

266037,5,6300247333,"This is the last movie of the Damian Thorne saga and he just couldn't claim the earth for his father Satan.

This is just my take on this movie. I d prefer not to have scintillating
and clever banter about religion.

Damian Thorne at his worst. He had great plans for taking over the earth but he was bought down because of his inflated ego.

In the end he was bought down by one of his young prodiges.",1428969600,,402,4.128205128205129

266039,2,6300247333,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two ""Omen"" films, and was looking forward to seeing the end of the trilogy. The first film was so we done, a great story with strong acting and directing. The second film featured a wonderful wintery setting, another set of fine performances and script full of twists and turns, and I was hoping for more of the same with this third entry.

As the film opens we see one of the seven daggers needed to kill Damien unearthed in from deep in the Earth, it makes it's way from the miner's hands through a pawn shop, to an auction house and eventually all seven daggers arrive at a small monastery in Italy. Here seven priests agree that Damien must be stopped as signs point to the second coming of Christ. Damien, now a grown man and running Thorn industries, also knows his arch-rival is coming and prepares to stop him by any means necessary.

I don't want to toss out any spoilers, so I'll keep it vague, but there are some decent parts to this film, just not enough to overcome the tedium you have to sit through for the majority of the movie. I like some of the ideas the movie presents, like the murderous priests trying to take Damien out, and Damien's plan for destroying the Nazarene, but none of the ideas presented here play out very well, and I will also say that if you are hoping for an epic confrontation between the Son of God and the Son of Satan, then you will be disappointed. The so called climax of the movie if a pretty dull affair overall.

Overall a pretty lousy entry in the series, but if you've watched the first two films, you need to see the conclusion to the trilogy.",1420156800,,1625,4.374172185430464
266040,4,6300247333,"Good acting and a decent screenplay lead the watcher on a trip to the dark side again.  This film is entertaining,  and although it lacks the nuances and subtleties of the original,  it is still a great 80's film.",1419206400,,213,4.410256410256411

266080,4,6300247333,"Good movie with a great actor for Damien.

266081,5,6300247333,"I think this is the best of the OMEN trilogy. It is definitely the most believable for this genre. Sam Neil is very good as Damien. Powerful Gerry Goldsmith score and great cinematography and atmosphere are outstanding. There is gratuitous violence and killings along the way but these are played down and are very low-key compared to this film's predecessors. For instance, the outrageous violence was the focus of the second OMEN film. This film puts these on the back burner and focuses on the central characters and theme.

266085,5,6300247333,"This third and ""Final"" part of the Omen trilogy works-for me.  And it hinges on Sam Neill's more subtle than expected performance.  He didn't have to go over the top with an evil grin or glowering stare.  Instead he played it charming, unthreatening-unless he had to take out  a good guy.  And I was disappointed that the final confrontation  was kind of one-sided-pretty well knowing in advance who the winner would be.  Still. for what it tried to be. I'll give it thumbs up.",1412640000,,477,4.607142857142857

266141,3,6300247333,"Few would deny that the original Omen was a masterpiece of dark brooding horror in a Rosemary's Baby vein.

The second installment, whilst not capturing the spirit of the first, acquitted itself well.

Which brings us to the conclusion. Sam Neil is great - the antichrist about to realize his destiny. But it lacks.

To be fair, the first and second acts are great, but the ending is dire, with the whole prophecy being ret-conned into a meaningless mess.

A very limp end.",1394323200,,473,4.662650602409639
266142,3,6300247333,"The third, and final chapter ( we don't count the made-for-tv #4)
takes us to the lush countryside of England and into the secret private world of The Antichrist, Damien Thorn.
He is now 33 and ready to slowly take over the world.  Everything is in place and there is even a scene where he speaks with ""The Nazarene"" (who in his warped vision has been crucified backwards on the cross in the form of a twisted statue) Certainly blasphemous, Damien is evil and enjoys every minute of it!
He literally rapes and pillages and tries in vain to prevent Christ from returning to Earth(conveniently London, just blocks away from Damien's office- ok, it was a bit hard to believe). Early on, we see the very British Prime Minister who has just been mad dogged into setting up the most elaborate suicide in the history of cinema.
All with a simple typewriter ribbon , a .45 caliber pistol , and a well-timed press conference.  After watching it in slo-mo on my flatscreen, I rejoiced as the blood splattered and if you watch closely, a little flap of his scalp falls from the wall behind him. Sam  Neill is brilliant and his screen debut proves he is still amazing today. If you are a fan of The Omen, this is one to see right before bedtime , but you may want to keep that Bible on the night stand and put the dogs outside!",1392681600,,1315,4.403292181069959

Verbatim, Thorn Inc controlling food supply and artificially creating food shortages, and the necessity for all seven daggers to be used in order to destroy Damien. The end of the film couldn't have been more anti climatic as well with Christ receiving a 3 second cameo. Jesus should've eviscerated Damien with light and/or had a lofty diatribe scene in which to leave the viewer satisfied due to the climatic build up posed by the earlier movies. The only reason I am giving the film a five star rating is because, as a fan of the technical aspects of filmmaking, the fox hunting scene was incredible due to its intricacy. The length of the dolly shot and the lighting, both during the chase and when Damien is returning, are marvelous. Bravo to the director for that particular part of the movie, I only wish the dialogue and plot had been commensurate to the directing.

I also wonder what was edited out during production and if the film was butchered due to time constraints. For instance, where the f did ""The Watch"" come from? Was Damien seeking apostles when he was playing polo and receiving accolades in college? How did he amass such a covenant? How did they meet? Where was that location? Was there a party at some remote, isolated mansion before they descended into a rock quarry? Or are these just the people who were on the geldings during the foxhunt? But wait there were only about 40-60 people at the hunt, how did a thousand people end up there? Are they from the Agency?....etc. So many questions... Oh well.",1383782400,2,1604,4.708185053380783

266212,3,6300247333,"The battle between good and evil will now be decided in THE OMEN 3: THE FINAL CONFLICT! Damien Thorn has eased his way in to political power through the international peace missions of his company, Thorn Industries, but with each step closer to the presidency, Damien's plans for world domination near completion. There is only one power that can stop him now: The second coming of Christ, whose rebirth is marked by the alignment of three stars in the heavens. Now, Damien seeks to destroy The Nazarene while corrupting as many souls as he can in the process!

Director Graham Baker follows the same relaxed pace in THE FINAL CONFLICT as we have seen in the first two OMEN films, but unfortunately, his timely approach never pays off. There is no 'final conflict,' as the title suggests. Instead, the series stops short with a disappointing and anticlimactic finale. That isn't to say that this third entry is entirely without merit, however. Sam Neill steps straight out of the Book of Revelations with his frightening portrayal of the Antichrist. He is handsome and charming, yet behind every crooked smile, we can see his sinister intent. Neill delivers several earth-shattering monologues that are sure to make even non-believers uncomfortable. THE FINAL CONFLICT also boasts some of the darkest moments in the series, including Damien's plan to rid England of all male children born on March 24th in the hopes of killing the Christ child. As the closing chapter to the original lineage, THE OMEN 3 is a worthwhile addition to the series, though the abrupt ending and condensed storytelling leave something to be desired.

I thought the acting was ok and agree that the death scenes could have been better.  The suicide scene was pretty good though. My biggest complaint was that they did not stick to the original premise where you had to kill Damien with the knives in a specific way.  This was very important for the end of the first movie. In this one, the sent a bunch of buffoons out with one knife each to do the job.  If they stuck with the original premise, how could 1 idiot with 1 knife do the trick?  Also, where did all the devil worshipers come from that were following Damian?  I thought this was a little silly.

266258,3,6300247333,"A child was born and his father abandoned him, perhaps worse.  The child moved to another country, and at a fairly young age this child came to power.  He was very charismatic, giving great speeches that made the young people rise up to support him, even though he was evil.  At least one old man tried to defeat him - even some women - but they all failed.  After all, this man was born of pure evil.

No, we're not talking about a potential world leader; we're talking about Damien Thorne, a man who is nearly as evil and destructive as the above child.

But what is curious to me is the following:  if I were the Antichrist, I wouldn't waste my time running a company or becoming an ambassador.  I would have bigger fish to fry, like making people suffer, and doing standard human stuff is a real drag on your time.  But how would I make these people suffer?  Well, instead of bringing prosperity, I would bring unemployment and chaos.  I would make the rich and the poor - and all races - hate each other.  I wouldn't waste my time on some useless fox hunt or consume my time by heading some multi-national startup.  Think big!

Well, I had a good time writing this review about a movie that wasn't so good.  Sam Neill?  Yeah, he's not bad as an evil dude.  But I know somebody else, some real life guy, who's far scarier.",1346630400,,1326,4.303643724696356
266259,5,6300247333,This is another great sequel to the omen series. Now Damien is an adult and hes an ambassador to the president. He is now fully aware of his unholy trinity and who and what he is and kills anyone in his way. There are now priests after him with the 7 daggers of Megido the only weapons that can kill him. Each of them try to kill him but most of them end up dead until there is one left. He also has many followers some brainwashed like the children and others who willingly follow him. He also has to worry about how the Christ child will be born and that he'll be defeated. So he has his followers try to kill every baby boy that was born on March 24th. He also has a love interest that complicates matters and I think for a few minutes he looks like he wants to give that up for her but then doesn't cause hes got more important things to accomplish: destroy the christ baby and take over the world. Its a great sequel to the first two movies. It may have its boring parts in it but then so do the other two. But it was Sam Neills first big hollywood movie that made him famous here. And later on you see him in Jurassic Park 1 and 3 and in the Tudors and in many more movies. And hes very handsome in this movie. He's still very handsome today. So if you like the omen movies and you like Sam Neil movies then watch this. And hey even if you don't like it Sam Neil is very handsome so women and girls like me will have some hot guy to look at.,1319414400,,1447,3.958904109589041

Damien Thorn(Sam Neill) is trying to vanquish all opposition to his assuming his place as evil overlord of the Earth before the prophesied return of Christ.  A group of priests are out to eliminate Damien before he can enact his diabolical plan.  ""The Final Conflict"" has to viewed after seeing the preceding films because it assumes that you've seen them.  It works more as a stand alone than the preceding film, ""Damien-Omen II"".  Unlike the previous film, however, I would give it four stars even I hadn't seen the others.",1319068800,,656,4.660869565217391

266262,1,6300247333,"Read other reviews for a description of the plot, because...

Last night a friend of mine, who loves this movie, said, ""Remember that one part in The Omen 3.......blah blah blah...wasn't that a good scene?""  I said, ""I've never seen that movie.""  He said, ""Yes you have.  I brought it over that one time.""  I said, ""When?""  He said, ""Like maybe two years ago.""  I still didn't remember it.  Then he began to describe it more.  Then I suddenly vaguely remembered the movie.  I said, ""Oh yeah...I think I remember now.  That was like in February 2009 when you brought that over.  Yeah, I didn't like that movie.  That's why I forgot all about it.  It's a forgettable movie.  It didn't stick with me.""

The above paragraph sums up my feelings about this movie.  It was so lousy, boring, and not scary that I ended up forgetting that I even saw it.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your time seeing it.",1290297600,2,895,4.4875
266263,4,6300247333,"The first Omen was a masterpiece both from the perspective of acting and screenplay and in terms of being a frightening movie.  The second had a weaker screenplay, acceptable acting though still had a few creepy jolts.  This last in the series still has the tone of classic late 70s horror films (actually 1980) and is about on par with the second Omen in terms of production value.  I found it less scary than Omen 2, and nowhere in the neighborhood of the first one.  Parts of Omen 3 seem a little ridiculous, but overall if you like the vibe of 70s ""scary dramas"", e.g. Omen, Amityville, Exorcist, etc.., then this Omen 3 has a curiosity value that might appeal.  It's not a great film (certainly no 5 stars), nor is it 1 or even 2 stars.  It's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars - I'd understand either.  Since I often give films I didn't enjoy much 3 stars, I'm giving it 4 because I did find it interesting - perhaps not so much for the convincingness of its story, but more for its production and time period.  I found the film fairly well shot.  And again, these devil movies were all the rage a few decades ago while you don't see as many any more.  So perhaps one of my 4 stars is for nostalgia.",1284681600,,1202,4.278761061946903

With this movie, it was told that in the first movie that the Antichrist would rise in the world of Politics and usher in his father's rule.  Although there's one thing that stands in Damien's way and that's Jesus Christ that is shown in the constellations signaling his second coming.  Not only that but some priest have managed to recover the daggers that were supposed to be used on Damien in the previous two movies, the first time by his dad, then the second time by his uncle, neither of them being successful.  When Damien learns of Jesus Christ's second coming, he then tries to do what he can to give himself a upper hand in the confrontation with him, as he orders to have any new born babies born on a date between certain times.  By the time that confrontation comes about, I was hoping that there would be more of a confrontation between Damien and Jesus Christ, knowing how the first two films had leading up to this point though I believe that it could've been handled a little better.  Overall this gets 3 stars out of 5.",1280188800,,1182,4.394495412844036
266265,5,6300247333,"I had never seen ""The Omen 3-The Final Conflict"" until recently. After the first two versions in the ""Omen"" movies were released people pretty much forgot that there was a part three and ultimately a part four. In this film Sam Neill plays the adult Damien (the son of the anti-Christ) who now holds down a serious job as an Ambassador to England for the United States. He decides in order to control the world he must rid those who want to destroy him, namely a series of priests who know about him and his parentage.
 The movie is quite engrossing and involving. The story moves at a fast pace and the script is both strong and intelligent. The death scenes are not to be missed as the production is first rate and horrifying.
 Sam Neill steals the film as his performance is evil, convincing, and sexy. I never thought that when someone played the son of the devil that they would exude an overabundance of sexuality, but that's what Neill brings to his role. This is also Neill's first major Hollywood film with mainstream audiences knowing him now for turns in TV's ""The Tudors"" and ""Jurassic Park"".
 The movie is very short on bonuses, but there is an informative audio commentary by director Graham Baker.
 ""The Omen 3-The Final Conflict"" is available as a stand-alone DVD or as part of the impressive ""Omen"" boxset that features all the ""Omen"" films.",1278892800,2,1358,4.622406639004149

Having been a long-term horror fan, it really says something when a guy like me gets grossed out because a movie is about baby after innocent, defenseless baby being killed. And all because they are SUPPOSEDLY the second coming of Christ. Let me ask you this: if you were Christ and you wanted to come back because Damien was the anti-you, would you come back as a creature that was too weak to fend for itself? Of course not!!! You would come back as an adult so you could have at least a 50-50 chance of winning! In other words, the filmmakers made a conscious choice to have babies as the main victims in this movie. Sick, sick, sick!!!!",1254441600,,761,4.255172413793104
266320,3,6300247333,"Sorry, but I have to talk for a moment about the concept of the ""Part 3"".  I like watching Part 3s, especially Part 3s to successful, blockbuster flicks.  By the time you get to a Part 3 in a series, the screenwriters are trying their damnedest to put a new spin on the story and take it in a different direction to separate it from the first.  This usually results in laughable, silly and outrageous ideas on film.  After all, everything cool and worthwhile was in Part 1, and sometimes you can wring a few interesting concepts from a Part 2, but by Part 3 you're really stretching it(and of course even more so if more sequels are made).  Stuff like Star Wars and Back to the Future don't count coz they were envisioned as trilogies from the getgo.  But Part 3s can be very fun to watch in their own right.  They might be bad films(in rare cases they are better than the Part 2), but can be enjoyed in a different way than the first film was enjoyed.
It's because of Part 3s that Rocky is getting thrown out of the ring by Hulk Hogan, and that Superman is teaming up with Richard Pryor and dealing with an evil twin.  It's also the reason Karate Kid 3 ended up being Karate Kid 3.
Well, in this case of Part 3s, I'm talking about the Antichrist.  No, not Will Farrell, good ol' Damien from The Omen.  In the Final Conflict he has managed to go from 5 to 32 years old in the space of 5 years.  He is now reigning king of Thorn Industries and ambassador to Great Britain.  He gets a bit worried when he finds out that Christ has recently been reborn, and sends his ""Disciples of the Watch""(Ha! Now I know where Testament got that!) to kill all babies born on that particular day.  If that weren't stressful enough for the Antichrist, there's a gang of Antichrist hunters out to assassinate him.  Armed with those daggers that were given to Gregory Peck in the first film, they periodically attack, only to fail of course.  Besides, wasn't this act supposed to be carried out on hallowed ground?  Oh well, it's a Part 3.
There's also a reporter who has the hots for Damien, then eventually realizes who he is, but by that time her son has been brought into the Antichrist fold.  Damien also introduces her to the wonderful world of rough sex.
This movie is okay.  It's not terribly exciting, but just interesting enough to make you want to see it through.  Yes, some new concepts are thrown in, but this movie really doesn't feel like a horror film at all, and that's a far cry from the first Omen.  I've always really liked Sam Neill, but it's difficult for me to buy him as the Antichrist.  He's too nice or something.  He seems more just like a corrupt and shrewd  corporate headhoncho than the son of the devil.  Plus, you'd think the ""final conflict"" between Jesus and the Antichrist would be a bit more epic.  I mean, this is the battle of all battles, baby!!  This should be Cecil B. Demille on friggin' steroids.  This should make Lord of the Rings look like Deathstalker 4.
Oh, well.  I guess for a movie that was pretty unnecessary to begin with, it wasn't all that bad.",1244937600,4,3079,4.3543859649122805
266321,4,6300247333,Omen 3: The Final Conflict (1981) was a four star sequel and pretty darn good for number three in any series.  The best thing about this film was that it introduced many of us to Sam Neill who was quite good in the role of Damien. After this movie I started taking note of all the films that he made.,1244678400,,300,4.0
266322,5,6300247333,"I think this is the best of the OMEN trilogy. It is definitely the most believable for this genre. Sam Neil is very good as Damien. Powerful Gerry Goldsmith score and great cinematography and atmosphere are outstanding. There is gratuitous violence and killings along the way but these are played down and are very low-key compared to this film's predecessors. For instance, the outrageous violence was the focus of the second OMEN film. This film puts these on the backburner and focuses on the central characters and theme. This is a very impressive film.",1239062400,,557,4.9361702127659575
266323,1,6300247333,"The final entry in the ""Omen"" trilogy actually oudoes its predecessors: it represents the nth degree of cinematic tripe.  Sam Neill's rendering of Antichrist conveys all the subtlety of horns, goatee and pitchfork.  Moreover, his mass assassination of British infants could not be more ludicrous: such stuff really out-Herods Herod!  Finally, the Bad Man's defeat plunges to a level of bathos unequaled in the annals of anticlimax: it makes one long for the old Elizabethan stage wherein demons made their exit through a trap door while flinging fireworks at this Sinful World!

  Less horrific than horrible, ""The Omen 3"" is simply the nadir of filmmaking: an utter waste of time and celluloid.  Is it any wonder that horror film cognoscenti--real Goths--prefer European and Japanese movies to such feculent products of Hollywood?",1166572800,3,831,5.297709923664122
266324,4,6300247333,"At first, it would seem The Omen 3 (1981) is mistitled as ""the final conflict"" but really it isn't. This is where the franchise was plannned to end and where it should have ended. If you're as hooked as me and haven't seen Omen 4, stop with this one so you'll continue to have great memories ofthe frightfest called the Omen.

In The Omen 3 (1981), Damien is an adult and CEO of The Thorn Enterprises. He is a smart and charismatic politician and an extremely powerful man positioned to achieve even more greatness so that his father might one day rule the world. To stop him from plunging the world into darkness, there's a group of priests who are after Damien. Damien is well protected by his disciples and can only be killed with a special dagger.

Like the first two films, this film is well made especially considering most horror sequels end up being shlockfests rather than frightfests. The movie has several scenes that'll stick with you and another strong script with good performances from the actors. The story continues to be very convincing and very creepy.  Overall I think that it was a solid effort and a great sequal that wraps up the trillogy though with a lot more gore than the previous films.",1166313600,,1214,4.585253456221198

266326,1,6300247333,"Could it get any worse than this? Forget the OMEN IV TV disaster. 20th Century Fox sold the entire ""Omen"" franchise right down the tubes with this poorly acted, scripted, and Graham-Cracker Baker directed mess. Originally, Fox had planned two further sequels to OMEN II, one in which Damien would be in his 20's and then in his 30's in control of his Uncle's corporation. They settled for one ""final"" conflict and in late 1980 had televised a cleverly edited highlights trailer for this film, shown during a telecast of OMEN II. I waited with bated breath, even though the trailer seemed mysteriously bereft of dialogue or the creative death scenes of which the series was known for. The novelization preceeded the movie and it was essentially a one idea book...Damien in search of the reborn baby Christ. On opening day, it was apparent from critical & audience reaction that Fox had delivered onto us a bomb of major proportions, the dregs of the series and horror in general. Sam Neill may have looked the part, but boy...that acting or lack thereof. Listen to his intonations when he tells Harvey Dean the Messiah will come out of ""ANGGGLAAAND"". Listen to him deliver the line ""don't let the Red CROOSSSSSS beat them to it."" That's acting? Rossano Brazzi, as poor a job as he did in the movie as the head of an all-monk asasination squad, at least brought some unintentional comic relief to the proceedings. Can you not laugh in hysterics everytime he refers to Damien as ""Dum-eon Torn, da Dandychrist""? Who exactly is ""Dumeon Torn""? The acting and mentally challenged long lost brother of actor Rip Torn? The movie lacks pacing, atmosphere, & effects. What exactly did the Ambassador see in the mirror that was so horrifying it drove him to suicide...the tremendous bags under his eyes? How horrifying to see the two priests ""trapped"" by a sliding gate in the old church as pre-CGI lightning rips across the sky outside. How spine-tingling to see a nurse turn down an oxygen lever in a nursery to snuff out a prospective Christ Child! Oh the terror at seeing a child's ball hit a mom in the head and watch as her errant carriage get barely tipped over in perfect condition by an oncoming car? Look at Barbara Dean (this actress must of taken a correspondence school course in acting right before filming began) and the expression on her face when she sees a charcoal faced baby take the place of her infant in its crib. She looks like she's smelling onions.  Can you not cringe when Harvey Dean returns home only to find out DeCarlo has visited her to warn her about Damien? ""A priest was here today and he told me Damien Thorn is and ANDY-CHRIIIIST, and he'll kill my baby just like he murdered all these other children."" Oh, brother. And finally, what about ""the final conflict""? Later on after Dean repudiates Damien he returns home to effectively say ""Barbara....start packing! I just screwed over the Antichrist!"". Were we not cheated in not seeing Damien battle his adversary the Holy One as prophesized? And what's with being done in by one dagger from some frizzy headed newscaster with a penchant for screaming out ""love me Damien"" during kinky sex? The movie goes against its own mythos...all seven were needed to destroy Damien body and spirit. Jerry Goldsmith's score was the one thing that was likable here...he expanded on themes present in the other two scores and embellished them wonderfully with music heralding the second coming. Forget those idiots who claim ""Omen II"" isn't a good movie...it's a respectable followup to THE OMEN with real star power that carries a sense of dread and terror in the Damien's coming of age story. This ""Final Bomb"" concluded the story in the worst possible way...cheaply and without horror or any redeeming drama.",1153872000,11,3770,4.7910906298003075
266327,4,6300247333,"Yes, ""The Final Conflict"" - third in the ""Omen"" Series - suffers from a few flaws at the screenplay level. I mean, let us not beat around the burning bush here- The apocalyptic battle between good and evil is minimalized to seven cossack monks (each armed with one of the sacred Seven Daggers of Meggido, the only weapons known to be capable of ending Damien Thorn's life) wandering the countryside, attempting to assassinate Thorn? That's a bit of a stretch. And, theologically speaking, Christ is due to return as a conqueror,not as a helpless child who could conceivably be executed during a campaign to mass murder all children born at the same time and on the same date.

  Those qualms aside,this is a genuinely chilling and thought provoking film. Watching ""Conflict"" recently, I was reminded that - once upon a time - we expected legitimate PERFORMANCES from our actors,instead of allowing special f/x overkill to tell the story. To wit, it's all about a then young Sam Neill. He is simultaneously compelling, charming and creepy as the adult Damien, never leaving the viewer a shred of doubt that he has nothing but the worst intentions for the souls of mankind.

  It's apparent that the operative budget constrained the filmmakers from pulling off the climactic battle they were going for, and on that level there is a feeling of disappointment. However, all such reactions are overwhelmed by a sense the filmmakers were telling a compelling story, a good one at that, and what we are left with is a modern masterpiece, really. This is a film that - honestly- will NOT resonate well with a bunch of kids raised on a steady diet of CGI monsters, nonstop explosions, endless gun battles and cool,hip throw away lines.

  A quieter, more meditatitve film that allows the true nature of evil to be exposed as it unfurls it's story one chapter at a time is hardly what modern audiences are clamoring for, so it's no surprise ""The Final Conflict""  couldn't find a niche audience until the past few years, when more sophisticated filmgoers began to search the movies of their youth for something - ANYTHING - offering an intelligent counterpoint to the gutter trash occupying most theaters today. ""The Final Conflict"" is one such film, a well-crafted picture which triumphs ( despite it's obvious flaws) and delivers the goods as both a theological drama and a terrifying horror film. I know I've gone on too long here,so let me wrap with three final observations:

  1)This IS a horror film, and the ""creative death"" sequences are -if anything- more craftily orchestrated than ever before. In fact,there is a death by fire early in the picture which,in my estimation, may be the single most horrific method of dispatching a victim these people have come up with yet.

  2)The late Jerry Goldmsith's score to this film is perhaps the greatest score ever composed for a horror film, one as dramatic and sweeping as it is operatic and stirring. The fact that it never recieved an Oscar demonstrates an Academy bias against the genre.

  3) For all those who,in their reviews of this film, lamented that the plot changed to allow the seven monks to hunt Damien down armed with only one dagger apiece - rather than immediately planting all seven daggers into him in the pattern of a cross (as stated in the original film) - I offer this observation: in  ""The Omen"", the exorcist Bugenhagen clearly states that the first dagger planted into Thorn's body will extinguish physical life. I believe this is a no-brainer. These monks were intelligent enough to know that getting one dagger into Thorn - who was the US Ambassador to Great Britian (and therefore heavily guarded at all times) -would be difficult enough. There was no way they were ever going to get get him into a room with seven knife-wielding holy men, so it actually makes thematic sense that they would eschew trying to destroy his spirit, for the time being, in favor of achieving their primary objective- ending Damien's physical existence to insure the safety of the Christ child. If you're going to criticize the film, please pay attention to all of the details.

Peace out,kids!!! - D.S.",1153612800,3,4155,4.832157968970381
266328,5,6300247333,"The Final Conflict is a rare film in its genre...consisting of sumptious production standards, no over the top CGI or hammy lines....just beautiful cimematography, strong acting and the best element of all....Jerry Goldsmith's compellingly beautiful score.... this movie demonstrates how a powerful film score can transcend and lift a film into a higher realm of fantastic possibilities ........in my opinion this film is a perfect-seamless blend of visionary lushness and sound....I believe this to be Goldsmith's greatest score with the exception of that composed for Ridley Scott's film Legend ... again a beautiful example of evocative film making incorporating the undeniable power of a perfect film score.

266369,3,6300247333,"This 1981 film is the second sequel to the oustanding, 1976 gothic thriller ""The Omen"". The Antichrist, Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), is now all grown up and, having inherited the entire family maga fortune, is now in the process of fulfilling both his destiny and a biblical prophecy of calamitous proportions. Unfortunately for him, however, his very existence is in jeopardy, as the second coming of Christ appears imminent.

Damien is kept busy in this film. As Ambassador to England, as well as spiritual leader to a denizen of devil worshippers, he is the target of an assassination plot by a group of priests led by Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi). Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies. He is also hell bent on destroying the Christ child, as it is only by doing so that he can survive and fulfill his destiny.

This is a relatively well acted film that suffers from a somewhat weak script. Sam Neill is well cast as the adult Damien, giving a powerful performance. Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in ""The Omen"" and in the first sequel. Due to its weak script, however, the film pales in comparison to its predecessors.

A rare case of a genuinely good sequel, Graham Baker's superb ""Final Conflict"", brought to life by Jerry Goldsmith's horror opera and soaring on its Samothrakian wings, provides a beautiful conclusion to the story opened by Richard Donner's ""Omen"", and, sadly, soiled by the plotless cartoon sequel, ""Damien the Teenage Slasher"".

Since ""The Final Conflict"" was an intelligent, metaphorical film of subdued suspense rather than a revolting spectacle of special effects (which is what the cretins expected - just glance at the horrendously misspelled ""reviews"" excreted by their ""brains""), 'tis no wonder that a huge number of induhviduals disliked it. Since some 65% of humanity consists of dullards with VIQ of 110 or less, one cannot expect pictures of quality to be accepted and hailed en masse. The rare exceptions - such as the embrace of ""2001"" - usually happen when the dullards' groans are muted out by the enthusiasm and welcome from the thinking audience. In such cases, when the dullards find themselves surrounded by applause for Art that they are unable to comprehend, they mutter ""Huh? Me supposed to like dis?"", and from then on pretend to enjoy the film, understanding only that ""it's trendy to say so"". ""The Final Conflict"" was not given this treatment, but the fact that the dark masses are staying away from it merely improves the experience of savouring its exquisite taste.",1138838400,3,1701,5.181818181818182

On the negative side... Well, the story speaks for itself. Damian Thorne is now 32 years old. He is head of that Thorne company from the second movie. But he has to become ambassador in England, so he can fight Christ - who (according to ""The Book of Hebron"") is going to be reborn in there. Damian Thorne also has a large following of satanists, or whatever, that he preaches to, and commands to kill all the babies that were born on the day Christ was to be reborn (according to an astrological phenomena). Apart from Christ, Damian has some other enemies: seven Roman Catholic priests (or monks? or are they both?) have discovered his secret identity as the Antichrist, and have bought the seven knives that can kill Thorne. Sounds interesting? Didn't think so.

I can turn a blind eye to the fabricated ""Book of Hebron"" that is to be apart of the Septuagint, and even to the nonsense of speaking of the ""original latin"" of its text. There are similar problems in the first Omen, and they don't bother me. But why would the Antichrist be chased by priests? And why does Jesus - who incredously is REBORN in His second coming, according the this film! - play such a minor part in the fight against the Antichrist?

DAMIEN: OMEN II was released in 1978, where Damien had the reached the age of 12 and fulfilled his Prophecy. But in 1981, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT was released to a wide audience. This sceond sequel, although not the last, is absolutely amazing and is one step better than DAMIEN: OMEN II.

  DAMIEN THORN (played by the brilliant Sam Niell) is now 32 years old and is running THORN INDUSTRIES, has been since the death Richard Thorn, Damien's uncle, who had been running it, since Robert Thorn's death. The death of Britain's current Ambassador has allowed the President of the U.S. to point the position U.S. Ambassador to none other than...Damien. The posistion had once belonged to his father and now, Damien is in the game.

  Over the course of the next few weeks, Damien has to thwart out the assassination attempt on his life that is planned by seven monks from Italy, who have possession of the seven daggers. With this in his hands, Damien also has to deal with the second coming of...JESUS CHRIST.

  In order to stop the Christ Child, whom Damien calls the Nazerean, Damien orders his disciples to kill every male infant that was born on March 24th of the year taking place. Damien begins an affair with British Television interviewer, KATE REYNOLDS (played by Lisa Harrow), but with the help of a priest named FATHER DeCARLO (played by Rossano Brazzi), Kate finds that Damien is the true Antichrist and he is readying to reign his command on earth after destroying the Christ Child.

  With the seventh dagger (since Damien has killed all the monk-assassins and taken the first six daggers), Kate stabs Damien, where he sees the apparition of Christ himself and then dies. Damien, after 27 years of killing and bringing nothing but evil to this earth, is now dead. But do not think that all evil is down and out, for their is another sequel coming your way.

  Although, DAMIEN: OMEN II was a great first sequel to its box-office smash of a predecessor, it was not as great as the first film. This second sequel right here, OMEN III: THE FINAL CONFLICT, was just as great as the first film, making up for what the second film did not quite make out to be. Sam Niell is the first major well-known actor to play Damien and he did one hell of a job. Sam Niell, in my opinion, was always a great actor, but he proved that to be 100% true with this role.

Strangely, few people seem to remember some of the controversy surrounding this series and how several Christian groups protested the making of sequals.

The film itself is hardly scary and all the elements of psychological horror are gone. Sam Neil is not bad as Damien...but scary? Hardly.

Without spoiling the ending (not that it's at all possible to spoil it more than the script does), let's just say in this movie that suddenly ceases to be relevant.

The movie for the most part consists of boring sequences in corporate offices, a ridiculous scene in the English woods where a bunch of incompetent priests try to kill Damien, and finally the climax where Damien walks around calling out a challenge to Christ to come face him man on man.

All of this could have been forgiven if the movie at least had some suspense or chill value. It has none - unless you find Sam Neill's Damien ranting to a statue of Christ chilling.

Instead you get a quiet, thoughtful movie about a fully mature Damien Thorne, seeking to begin his rule as a billionaire and CEO, making long range plans to rule the world, but falling in love instead with a sophisticated, strong willed career woman and losing his eternal throne as a result.

In addition, what little action there is in this film consists of bungled assasination attempts by priests who wield ""sacred knives"" and jump out at Damien like mean street punks menacing James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. Most of these scenes are unintentionally funny, some of them laugh out loud incredible.

The only scenes that really carry any conviction are the love scenes between Damien and his lady reporter. It's really odd what a strong, likeable character Kate Reynolds is.

I understand budget restraints and such, but how can you literally change biblical prophecy to fit their lame story?

The people who saw the original film and were filled with dread understood the coming evil embodied in the demonic child.

There are several reasons why this sequel doesn't work. First, the actors are terrible. Sam Neill, a versatile British character actor who can usually be counted on to create top - notch roles, is wooden as Damien. It was obvious this was not his starmakiing vehicle. He had to wait until Steven Spielberg cast him in ""Jurassic Park"" to become a familliar name.

To cut to the chase, this film is agreeably watchable and somewhat thought-provoking but not at all scary or horrific. There is an attempt for the horror to be more psychological than visceral. Despite a high body count, the spectacular set-piece deaths that were the hallmark of the first two films are sorely missing from this one. There is NOTHING that is even close to the dismemberments, impalings, and decapitations that made Omen 1 and 2 so compelling. The only moment that comes close involves a door handle, a revolver, and some typewriter ribbon (remember that?)- all orchestrated by an evil Rottweiler.
Making Damien an adult this time around puts the film at a disadvantage compared to it's predecessors. The idea of a young boy being the originator of tremendous evil is infinitely more disturbing than the rather banal assertion that grown men can be malicious.  Worse, a large part of the attempted mayhem in this one is perpetrated by Damien's dull, one-dimensional human disciples rather than by overwhelmingly powerful satanic forces.
The star-wattage is much lower than in previous efforts despite Rossano Brazzi being mostly wasted as the head of the monastic murder squad. It would have been interesting to have had, say, Richard Burton or Larry Olivier (both of whom were living at the time and had no problems about starring in mediocre junk if the price was right) add a bit of gravitas to the proceedings a la Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in the original movie or William Holden in 'Omen 2'. In fairness to Sam Neill he tries his best with an extremely iffy script, but he's just too charming and doesn't exude the dark menace the audience needs to feel for his character to be truly unsettling.
The final thing that bothered me about this movie is that there is simply way too much daylight for a horror film! This might sound facetious but the majority of the locations are sunny, scenic, and downright NICE! Both the previous films had a darkly Gothic nuclear-winter atmosphere with the action taking place in desolate, ugly, shadowy settings- the kind of locales where one can't help but anticipate gruesome things happening. Large parts of 'Conflict' look like a Constable landscape or a tourist promo for the joys of Middle England- places where the only things anyone is likely to die from are boredom or a noxious attack of hayfever.
And that's pretty much it. Oh, there's a subplot involving a TV journalist (played by a wooden actress with a ghastly rustic Seventies wardrobe) who has an affair with Damien and whose son comes under his evil influence- it's superfluous to requirements and utterly predictable. The aforementioned murderous monks are kind of engaging but are so totally inept in their efforts to kill the Evil One that it's hard to feel any sympathy for them. This plotline also breaks the Code of Sequels by rewriting the rules set in the first film. It's years since I saw it but I clearly recall that Damien has to be stabbed with all seven daggers on holy ground for him to be truly killed-it's why the original movie ends as it does.

Damien keeps busy thwarting his would be assassins, usually by consigning them to a brutal demise. He also carries on a romance that ends badly. Damien is very much aware of who he is and where his destiny lies. He is also hell bent on destroying the Christ child, as it is only by doing so that he can survive and fulfill his destiny.

Rossano Brazzi is excellent as Father DeCarlo, the priest determined to end the stranglehold that the Antichrist has on the world. Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes to the gothic atmosphere of the film with his chillingly creepy, musical score, just as he did in ""The Omen"" and in the first sequel.

266602,5,6300247333,"Although THE OMEN and DAMIEN: THE OMEN II are scary films, as a Christian, this one is by far the best in the series. Even though it is not 100% Biblically accurate, I felt that the Bible's message was represented accurately, and it does seem to follow Biblical prophecy very well. My favorite thing about the film is the ending, where Jesus returns ""not as a child, but as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords."" Sam Neill played Damien Thorne with scary realism and exciting presence. The only thing that could've been kept out was the sex scene (even though it's not as bad as the scenes in HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION and HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME). For anyone and everyone interested in Bible prophecy and exciting conflict. Grade: A+",1010534400,6,732,4.682170542635659
266603,3,6300247333,"I expected Damien the anti-Christ to be further along in his diabolical plans before he would die. Damien is just an ambassador to the UK when he is killed. Instead of bringing the world to the brink of an apocalypse, he is out fox-hunting in the English countryside. With so little of importance at stake, the ""final conflict"" between Damien and Christ is rather feeble and anti-climactic, like getting a Pinto when you expected a Porsche.
This is especially disappointing because the second film was setting up a plot line in which Damien's company would have a strangle-hold on the world's food supply.  I was hoping for global chaos in Omen III -- food riots, revolutions, etc. Omen III briefly reminds us of what Damien's company is trying to do but then drops that plot line completely. Hence the third film does not seem to be organically connected to its predecessor. Indeed, no characters from Omen II except Damien get screen time in Omen III. It's as if with Omen III someone else took over writing the screenplay and decided to take it in a different direction.
It also is odd that Damien was supposed to be such an assiduous student of biblical prophecies but overlooked the prophecy that appears on the screen at the end of the film. What, was Damien's bible missing a few pages of Revelations?
There are some well done scenes, but this film does not measure up to the first two films.  Still, it is fun in its own trashy way.",1008633600,11,1440,4.62109375
266604,3,6300247333,"While Damien Thorn, the Anti-Christ itself, now fully grown and a powerful political figure and businessman, is preparing to dominate the world, as it is prophesized somewhere in the bible, the daggers buried under the rubble of the Chicago Museum of Natural History at the climax of Omen 2 are found.  During an excellent opening credit sequence, we follow the daggers of Megiddo from a pawn shop, across the world, and into the hands of a group of Monks who have been patiently waiting for such an opportunity to be given to them.  Everything after that is rather listless, the 'accident' strewn plot enlivened only by a sorely underdeveloped romance of sorts between Damien and a television reporter.  The 'final' conflict itself is really anti-climatic, but Damien does get a great parting shot of a line.
The Final Conflict offers a few good things, namely a wonderful debut performance by Sam Neil as Damien and another excellent score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The photography is atmospheric and some of the death scenes are show stoppingly energetic, but that does not a good movie make.  On the negative side we have Damien Thorn, Evil Incarnate and out to Rule the World, then destroy it, who turns out to be far too boring of a one dimensional character to build a film around.  He has no conflict within himself and, outside of that pesky squad of monk assassins, he really has no outside conflict in which to engage him.  The previous movies worked better when focusing on a different character that finds out what Damien is and must then grapple with his/her own human doubt as well as the forces of evil.  Also fans hoping for a huge, global, fate of the world in the balance battle as a climax will be sorely disappointed, it is not to be found.  Worth seeing only for Sam Neil's performance and Goldsmith's score, but not for any kind of attempt at satisfying closure.",1003968000,2,1880,4.724770642201835
266605,2,6300247333,"Omen III: The Final Conflict was a bit of a disappointment. A young Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) portrays Damien, now in his thirties who has now fully come to terms with his destiny as the antichrist and seeks to stop the second coming of Christ by having his followers murder all children born during an astrological anomaly. There is also a group of seven 'priest hit men' who have recovered the daggers from the previous films and attempt to assassinate Damien throughout the film. The church assassination plot is probably the most interesting thing about the film, but the would-be killers are so bumbling and inept that Damien dispatches them effortlessly and it kind of defeats the purpose. The film's highlight is the assassination attempt during the foxhunt in which the priests substitute a fox to lure Damien alone to an ambush, which they execute perfectly, but apparently didn't think things through far enough to foresee that there might be difficulties in trying to wade through a pack of hunting dogs to get to Damien with the daggers when he has a history of using animals to do his dirty work...
The infanticides take place off camera, except in the case of a car striking a baby carriage, but it's still a pretty horrible concept which makes the film nearly as evil its predecessors, but Sam Neill's Damien comes across as being entirely too prissy and aristocratic to make a good antichrist. Wouldn't you think that the son of the devil would be way into drugs and debauchery? Damien seems more like the typical corporate CEO. The plot is riddled with holes and the ending is especially bad and don't even get me started on the woman who, after being warned by the priest that Damien is the antichrist, promptly falls in love with him...
Oh, and the murders are as follows: suicide by gunshot to the face, immolation while swinging upside down from a rope, trapped under a grate in an old castle and left to starve (?), fall off a horse and off a bridge, mauled by pack of hunting dogs, and finally, killed by possessed wife with steaming-hot iron to the face.",1003622400,,2078,4.695890410958904

Thank God for him that better roles were to come.  After the first knockout punch of the first two films, this one is a true waste.
The only saving grace is the Goldsmith score that single-handedly ""resurrects"" this turkey.",1003622400,3,501,4.724137931034483

7806829,3,6300247333,"THE FINAL CONFLICT is the weakest of the three legitimate OMEN films, but it is not without its charms. In some ways it is a case of what happens when Hollywood simply tries bunting with an existing franchise instead of boldly swinging for the fences. The result is a single, maybe a double if you're charitable; certainly not a home run.

THE OMEN films are the saga of Damien, the putative antichrist foretold by Christianity, who was illegally adopted as a child into the powerful Thorn family empire. His hapless relatives knew nothing of his true nature, and over the course of the first two films discovered only too late who has been living in their midst and sharing their last name. The first film dealt with Damien's early childhood as the still relatively innocent son of the American ambassador to Britain; the second with his ""tween"" years, when he was being raised by his uncle and slowly coming to understand his true identity and destiny.

In this film we get the final, adult version. A very nasty piece of work.

The third and final movie begins with several portentous events: the recovery of the Seven Knives of Magido from the ruins of the Thorn Museum in Chicago, and some astrological signs that indicate to the faithful that the Second Coming of Christ is imminent. Cut to 32 year-old Damien Thorn (Sam Neill), who has settled comfortably into his secret identity as the Antichrist and is in full control of the Thorn financial empire. Damien has his eye on the White House, but he's understandably concerned that the return of Jesus to Earth will short-circuit his plans. Believing that ""the Nazarene"" will be born in Britain, he arranges to be made Ambassador to the Court of St. James (as his adoptive father was), and commences a plan to slaughter every male child born on the night the star appeared. Standing in his way are a group of monks under the command of a determined abbot (Rossano Brazzi); the monks have recovered the Knives of Megido -- the only weapons that can kill Damien -- and pledged themselves to his destruction. Like everyone who sets themselves against Damien, however, the monks soon discover (painfully) that wanting to kill him and actually getting the deed done are two different things. In the mean time, a beautiful British reporter Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow) is falling for the rich, handsome, charismatic Ambassador, not realizing his true identity, or the fact that her son Peter (Barnaby Holm) is falling more and more under Damien's evil influence.

In this plot sounds a little underwhelming, it is. As many of the other reviewers have noted, THE FINAL CONFLICT has numerous problems, and the largest of these is its utter deviation from the Book of Revelations, those chapters of the Bible which crudely outline the story of the End Times. Naturally budgetary restrictions would have prevented the producers from telling that story in full, but a shrewd producer/director could have made skillful use of news broadcasts, stock footage, radio reports and other tricks to show the world's turmoil as a backdrop to the story. The first two movies, THE OMEN and DAMIEN: OMEN II, establish that Damien's rise to power is going to usher in the apocalypse, but the stakes in THE FINAL CONFLICT are far from apocalyptic. In fact they are pathetically meager. Instead of a demonic corporate titan grasping for political power, starting wars, encouraging a cult of personality and generally setting himself up as a counterfeit God, we get a snarky businessman who wants to kill some babies, shag a hot reporter (mission accomplished, by the way!) and spiritually seduce her son. It doesn't help either that two of Damien's able and sinister minions from the second film, Robert Foxworthy and Lance Henriksen, are nowhere to be found in this movie. Their presence would have put considerable backbone into the otherwise flaccid plot (Don Gordon, who is a fine enough actor in most circumstances, is miscast as Damien's dithering chief henchman). Another major flaw is the failure of the writer to build on the foundations laid by the underrated second movie, DAMIEN: OMEN II. One of the key plot points of that flick establishes that Thorn Corporation is buying up land all throughout the Third World, ostensibly for agricultural exploitation, but in reality to make poor nations entirely dependent on Thorn for their food. CONFLICT makes passing mention of this at the very beginning and then drops it, abandoning the very sort of storyline the film desperately needs. (You aim low, you hit low, and these guys hit pretty low.) Most egregiously, there are plot holes regarding Damien's attempt to kill the newborn Jesus which are so enormous they exert a kind of gravity on the entire second half of the movie. I can't say more than that without ruining things, but suffice to say a single line of throwaway dialogue makes most of what transpires in the first half of the film totally irrelevant.

To be sure, there is stuff here that works. Sam Neill, while somewhat bland (forgive me Sam; everybody loves you, and I do, too), bears an astonishing resemblance to Johnathan Scott-Taylor, the young actor who portrayed Damien in Part II, and there are times when he plays the character with enough depth to get you to like him and even feel sorry for him. He is, after all, the ultimate underdog: the guy who sets himself up to topple God off His pedestal. Rossano Brazzi carries off his role as the senior monk quite well, and there are some extremely grisly kills as the bumbling brothers try and fail to do away with the wily Damien, including a ""burning man"" sequence in a TV studio which has subsequently ascended into Hollywood stunt-man legend. Additionally, the fox hunting sequence where Damien dispatches a monk using dogs, and then anoints Peter with the man's blood, is also beautifully done, and works well within the story framework of the seduction of innocence by evil. And Neill produces a couple of genuinely nasty moments, including a hate-filled monologue given before a statue of Christ which has, like the burning man sequence, become legendary (the band Ghost wrote an entire song, ""Idolitrine,"" about it). But the movie's flaws -- small stakes, annoying departures from the series' canon, and an exceptionally limp ending -- make what ought to have been a triumphant finale more of a spluttering whimper. If only the studio had put some real muscle into the budget and the script, we might have had a terrifying classic on our hands. Instead, Damien's last words to the Nazarene seem more appropriate: ""Nazarene, you have won...nothing.""",1518307200,,6615,4.897413024085638
