8571084,5,B00BMUL2ZY,"When purchasing a low budget film, you know going in the quality might not be the same as a bigger budget Hollywood film, so it didn't bother me that it seemed low budget, because that is what this is. I am able to get past that really fast if the story is good. This story is good.
This type of horror movie is more scary than the Zombie ones so popular now, because this stuff really can and does happen. I believed every moment of it while watching this movie.
It's about the neighborhood guy who is keeping young girls in his home and slaughtering them one by one. None of the neighbors are the wiser, although the one next door does think the guy is kind of odd and has his eye on him. I don't want to give away too much, but it was very suspenseful, especially when someone came to his door to deliver a notice, and he was that close to being found out.
All in all, I recommend this movie to horror film buffs who like real live situations over blubbery things crawling out of swamps or falling down from outer space.",1375660800,7,1023,4.197969543147208
8571085,3,B00BMUL2ZY,"I thought this was pretty creepy and had enough really scary moments to keep me interested. There is gore, but it wasn't overkill. This IS NOT a Hollywood movie, it is obviously a low budget, independent film, but if you enjoy those horror movies you will love this. The ending, I thought, was really surprising and subtle and not what I would expect from this genre. I saw this on one of those 8 pack horror movie DVD's and it was definitely the best of the bunch. Of course the fact that I bought an 8-pack horror movie DVD tells you something about me so if its not your thing, then go elsewhere. But if you like Indie Horror this is a definite thumbs up.",1375660800,3,658,4.272
8571086,1,B00BMUL2ZY,I wish I had waited till someone else reviewed this movie.  It was not worth the time or the money spent on it.  It was cheaply made (like somebody's home movies).  I'm willing to overlook cheapness if the plot is good but there was no salvation in that department either.  I'm not saying this is the worst movie I've ever seen - it just wasn't worth paying money to see.,1374883200,2,371,4.257142857142857
