However, I made a concentrated effort to overlook her absence (Giovanna, where were you?!) in order to immerse myself in the movie and enjoyed catching up with the lives of these characters some ten years later.

I was fortunate enough to see the Los Angeles Premiere and have been waiting for the DVD (U.S. Format) to be released so this review is based on the theatre experience*, not the DVD.

8416050,2,B0044BIZX0,"Ten years after the wonderful "" Last Kiss "" , italian director Gabriel Muccino returns with "" Baciami Ancora "" , an interesting dramedy which finds our heroes from the first film , now reaching their fourties and still struggling with their lovelife troubles . If the focus on the first installment was more on Carlo and his wife-to-be Giullia , now more time is given to other characters like Marco and Veronica whose marriage has reached it's nadir after succesive failures to have a baby or Libia who has to deal both with the troubles of being a single mother and her depressive boyfriend Paolo .

Italians have always been known as a very extrovert people full of passion and our heroes here certaintly live up to that stereotype with their epic fights being followed by epic lovemaking . The movie has certaintly things  to say about adulthood and the large cast gives overall fine perfomances with Sabrina Impacciatore and Pierfrancesco Favino being especially fierce . Considering though that this is a story that wants to demonstrate the reality checks one faces while growing up , the happy ending with the multiple pregnacies felt forced . Also , it was very difficult to sympathize with wide-eyed , clueless Carlo . I really wanted Giullia to stick with Adrianno Giannini's  Simone . Heck , i even wanted Anna to leave him and go find someone more worthy . Good things in life don't come with living on auto-pilot and broken relationships don't get fixed with puppy eyes and endless i-love-you's .",1316304000,2,1509,4.773946360153257
