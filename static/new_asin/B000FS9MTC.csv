8125994,1,B000FS9MTC,"Electric Zombies (2006)
 I have seen several Zombie films made for $10,000, the purported budget for this wretched pile of junk.  Even by those abysmal standards this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel.  Nothing about this film reaches the exalted levels of marginal acceptability.  To whit-
 The sound recording, one of my constant concerns, has such a poor quality that many conversations cannot be understood.  It comes on sometimes too loud and sometimes too soft.  Sometimes the dialog submerges under the music track and cannot be understood.  Just terrible throughout.
 The quality of the cinematography sucks.  Sometimes the film is too dark to be easily seen and we end up trying to imagine what the director intends.  Sometimes the film is too bright, as if the camera shoots straight into a light bulb (not the case but it seems like it) and we cannot make out the details.  Just terrible, but intermittently terrible.
 The acting raises to the quality that you might expect from a film of this caliber and scope.  A couple of the actors stand out because they have some ability but the rest are friends, relatives or people rounded up at the burger shack.
 The writing seems to have been a concept rather than a script.  Actors flounder around thinking up things to say that may or may not make much sense.  The film ends with no conclusion.  What little story line that connects the various threads of the tale dissipate into nothingness.  We think the evil plot to take over the country has been wrapped up, but apparently it hasn't because someone is still stalking and killing the characters.
 John Specht directs from a story by John Specht.  Specht also acts in a supporting role.  Specht has directed a total of four low budget films.  Specht has also produced, acted and done various movie tasks.  Richard M. Novosak penned the screenplay (there must be a screenplay if someone is credited with a screenplay, right?).  The multitasking Novosak also acted in and produced Electric Zombies.  He has an involvement in a project in in progress as the director, producer and writer.  His new project is called Teenage Atomic Zombies in the Twenty-First Century.  One can only hope.  Fellow producer Trudy Lynn Barr also served as a voice actor in Electric Zombies.  She has an involvement in various ways with other John Specht projects.
 The merry band of would be film makers did their dirty deed in Saint Louis Missouri.
 By the way, Zombie fans, the Zombies in this stinker are metaphorical.  The bad guys send cell phone messages to people who then lose all self will and turn into puppets who do the bidding of the cell phone caller.  They aren't even real Zombies.  Not only is the film horrid in every technical and professional way possible, but the title is a fraud.
  Avoid this one brain not-a-Zombie flick.
 R rated.  One hour and 30 minutes.",1430956800,,2872,4.783673469387755

8125996,1,B000FS9MTC,"Wha'? I'm sorry...I must've dozed off...

1) ACTING: I'm torn on this one. I do not know if the stars of this movie just can't act, or if the script was just horrible, or possibly a combination of the two. I got the impression that a lot of the dialogue was ""make it up as you go."" And the director really needs to tell his actors not to stare into the camera.

2) PRODUCTION: The sound was bad, the filming was bad, the lighting was bad; it's as if EVERYTHING was filmed with a camcorder. Scenes don't flow together as the editing is really choppy and bad. This was more of a ""Crime Drama about mind control"" than a ""zombie / horror"" movie. And lastly, this movie had a listed budget of $10,000.00. I really don't see where it was spent, possibly on catering...?

3) THE ZOMBIES: There were zombies in this movie? Well, if you consider ""You are under my control and must do all that I tell you"" I SUPPOSE so, but it seemed like mind control to me. The fact that ""zombies"" was even in the title is very misleading, as we all know what the current definition of a ""zombie"" is.

4) THE CAUSE: IF there were zombies in this film, I suppose the cause would have been the secret microwaves being emitted to everyone's cell phones.

5) NUDITY: No amount of nudity would have saved this movie. I was in so much pain from watching this movie, I honestly do not remember.

There is absolutely nothing positive that I can say about this movie. I don't know what the people behind this movie were thinking. During the video store shoot out, I kept hoping one of those bullets would come through my tv screen and put me out of my misery. You would be better off to just stare at a blank tv screen for 90 minutes. Electric Zombies needs to have its power turned off...permanently.

8125997,1,B000FS9MTC,"The only thing Stephen King's novel Cell and this movie share is a common theme. I just viewed Electric Zombies and it is utter garbage. I still have not figured out why people make these movies. Some will say it is a labor of love, but honestly, if I had made this movie myself I would not love it, I would simply be embarassed.",1161475200,5,329,4.15625
8125998,3,B000FS9MTC,"The Steven King book you talk about sounds like a Japanese movie ""One Missed Call"" and a Korean Movie called ""phone."" So for you to review this by saying that it sounds like a Steven King book is lame. Both of those movies, Phone and One Missed call, came out way before the King book. So to you I say watch the movie before you review it. To King I say, Cell, sounds real original....",1159228800,,385,4.1466666666666665
