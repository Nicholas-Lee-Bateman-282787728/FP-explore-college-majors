Honestly, people should not be paying for this!  This should not be offered.",1489795200,,161,4.714285714285714
8197748,5,B000QUU7MA,Great video of London sights. I enjoyed it thoroughly.,1477526400,,54,5.111111111111111
8197749,1,B000QUU7MA,Waste of $$$  Dopey loud music overpowered the speaking.  Not a good tourist guide at all.  Looks like a home movie.,1359849600,2,116,4.428571428571429
8197750,1,B000QUU7MA,This video is the most boring video of London I have ever seen. It makes me not want to go to London.  Even though it is a DVD the quality of the footage is equal to a quality of the outdated video tapes. It wasn't what I was looking for when I wanted to explore and learn about London.,1315008000,3,286,3.847457627118644
8197751,1,B000QUU7MA,A class project for the sixth grade would be of better quality.  The only redeeming feature of this video is that it is not longer.,1304294400,4,131,4.24
8197752,3,B000QUU7MA,"The footage on this DVD is very dated, at least 20 years. The quality of the photography and the audio is extremely poor. The narration seems adequate and accurate, but I was detracted by the poor overall quality.  This was a waste of money.",1208217600,16,241,4.4772727272727275
