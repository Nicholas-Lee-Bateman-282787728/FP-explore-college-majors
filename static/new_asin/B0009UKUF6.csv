8066719,5,B0009UKUF6,"Biblical Treasures an Excellent film.

I recently viewed both Biblical Treasures of Turkey part one & two  and was compelled to write a review as I thought both films were  great. I have traveled to Turkey and find it a fascinating country  truly filled with biblical treasures. These films expose the  historic sites written in the bible that we have heard about, like  the first church of the Christians in Antioch and highways where  Paul walked. The photography was stunning and the research was  quite extensive. I would recommend these films for those who want  to visit Turkey and for those who have interest in Christian  history. Two thumbs up!",1232409600,3,653,4.8545454545454545
8066720,5,B0009UKUF6,"Robin D. Williams' ""Biblical Treasures of Turkey Part 2"" gives a truly breathtaking view both of ancient artifacts and the Turkish land that holds them. Early Christian sites and icons, Roman ruins and carvings, Islamic architecture, plus stunning views of the Turkish landscape--these are filmed lovingly and described in a narration that combines the knowledge of a scholar with the sensibility of an artist. Unlike some film-makers in this genre, Mr. Williams lingers on places and pans around objects long enough for us to get a real feeling for them. And what a feast! Something to be viewed many times.",1231804800,2,608,5.09
8066721,5,B0009UKUF6,"Turkey was the Roman province of Asia Minor. Until the time of Caesar wild lions prowled the territories. The country remains exotic to this day and has become one of the ""cool"" travel destinations for independent travelers. DVD visits many of the sites of the ancient world, including the Greek (later Roman) coastal cities, that were the backdrop of Biblical events, a number of which are described. Beautiful photography gives personality to the physical settings and makes them come alive. Valuable purchase for travelers and anyone interested in the locationsof the Bible. Second of two parts, some overlap but both worthwhile.",1231632000,2,632,5.267326732673268
8066722,5,B0009UKUF6,"I really enjoyed this DVD production on Turkey. My wife and I happened to watch a small segment at a friend's house and decided to buy our own copy. I particularly enjoyed the broad history and learning about the abundance of biblical sites that exist in Turkey. This is a very unique production with plenty of artistic visuals and a powerful music score. I highly recommend it.

While the program is generally excellent, there are some major negative points that push the rating down from five stars to three and may be sufficiently irritating to keep you from purchasing the disk(s):

[...]

* For some reason, Williams thought it desirable to improve on nature by touching up scenes with intense colors (fire red skies are one of his favorites). The overall effect is both distracting and vulgar. He does this in both Part One and Part Two, but much more in Part Two.

* [].

* Much of the material in this second part is redundant with that in the first. Additionally, Williams tried to become more ""artistic"" in this second part. For me, it doesn't work. So Part One is the better purchase; Part Two is questionable.

From Robin D. Williams' website: Robin D. Williams is acclaimed as one of the top travel filmmakers of America today and a most dynamic public speaker.

From a journey that doubled the size of a nation (Lewis & Clark), to a flight that changed the world forever (Lindbergh's Flight to Paris), to the spreading of Christianity by Saul of Tarsus, Robin D. Williams is a filmmaker who searches for the exact locations where great people made their mark in history.",1205884800,3,4021,5.47564935064935
