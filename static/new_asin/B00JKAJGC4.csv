8651701,5,B00JKAJGC4,"Just received this 4 Audie Murphy DVD collection from Germany. Wow, the picture quality was superb not to mention the packaging. Highly recommended for Audie Murphy western lovers. You need a Multi Region DVD player.  You can get that on Amazon as well.",1491523200,,253,4.883720930232558
8651702,5,B00JKAJGC4,I remember watching most of these movies at the drive-in theater when I was young and they're just as much fun for me now as they were then.  If you're an Audie Murphy fan and you have a region free DVD player they're well worth the money.  The packaging was an extra treat with each disc placed in a foldout of the original movie poster.  I was very pleased with the entire package.,1441670400,5,383,4.219178082191781
