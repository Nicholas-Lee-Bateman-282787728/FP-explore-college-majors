8432988,1,B004KJC1EA,Why would you put radio shows on a DVD? bought these (and they weren't cheap) but they are just unauthorized copies in a DVD format. Do NOT buy from this seller or this product!,1373760000,,177,4.235294117647059
8432989,5,B004KJC1EA,"The two discs have shows you have NEVER heard of.  The shows also feature stars you have (Burl Ives, Phil Rizutto to name but two.)  The $12.98 cost ($10.00 + $2.98 shipping) is a steal if you like old radio.  There are shows from the 30s, 40s and 50s (I have barely scratched the surface of looking at the titles on Disc One), and many are a hoot.  These are typical of what people listened to back when in addition to the ""classics"" we old radio fans love so much.  If you are looking for classics, stay away.  If you are looking to go back in time and just let me your mind wander, grab this!",1361404800,,595,4.086206896551724
8432990,4,B004KJC1EA,"Could you please add what shows and of what there is in this collection?

Only a number doesn't tell buyers/collectors much and it would be nice for people to know what is in the collection before buying it.  I am interested, but want to know what I am buying before I start handing out my money.  Please add the info back then feel free to send me a message and I will check back in on this product.  From the limited info it looks interesting.",1349913600,,445,4.2
