7513781,4,B017RR79FM,"Stumbled across this through following the career of Alexander Skarsgrd, who portrays the antagonist in this tale (Monroe). A long flashback to 1976 San Francisco sounded worth watching, and for whatever reason (probably the movie poster), figured it might be somewhat of a farce (1976 San Francisco!) Instead, I was presented with a stunning, brutally frank look at the world through the eyes of a teenage girl in a chaotic setting during turbulent times. Although she was coming up in an atypical environment, the thoughts of the protagonist, Minnie, seemed authentic enough. Minnie navigates through a mired haze of non-parenting, with only her intuition and her friend Kimmie (well, in addition to institutional and societal influences of the period).

It's disturbing to watch Minnie learn the hard way. Plenty of times you'll be yelling at the screen ""Minnie, don't do it!"" or ""Minnie, can't you see through him?!"" (or at least you'll be thinking it). The occasional levity in a film centered around statutory rape is not misplaced; author Phoebe Gloeckner and screenwriter Marielle Heller infuse The Diary of a Teenage Girl with grim humor and ludicrousness to deride the negative aspects of the era's counterculture and to prove Minnie the strong one. The animated sequences were superb and altogether fitting, given Minnie's artistic talent and ambition. Her correspondence with Aline Kominsky in this movie was almost profound to me, as I remember those same feelings of awe at reading the works of underground artists like R. Crumb, Kim Deitch, Glenn Head, Daniel Clowes, and Aline Kominsky.

While enough to drag you into depression if you let it, The Diary of a Teenage Girl prevails as a work worth viewing. I'm not ashamed to admit my eyes were tearing up during the closing credits of Minnie playing at the beach with her little sister. Most of the film is tough going (it will get negative reviews for this fact), but makes us the better for it. Just prepare to be taken aback.",1452384000,5,1994,5.003012048192771
7513782,5,B017RR79FM,"I saw the movie that at the New Directors/New Films film festival in New York in March 2015. I read Phoebe Gloeckner's graphic novel that the film was based on. Although I did enjoy the book, I did struggle with the characters and a lot of the things the characters were doing, but I couldn't wait to read it every night. I loved the way she told the story of a 15-year-old girl that has just started an affair with her mother's boyfriend in 1970's San Francisco.

I was drawn to read the book and see the movie because I am a huge Alexander Skarsgrd fan and I love to support his films. His character, Monroe Rutherford, seemed like a total jerk in the book. Alex's take on the character was much sweeter. Sure, the content is the same, but the characters in the movie (ALL of the characters) seemed much more likable in the movie. It was hard to see why Minnie would be so into Monroe in the book, but it is quite evident in the movie. Besides Alex's handsome good looks, his Monroe is a happy-go-lucky guy that shows he has a heart. (Very caring) Not that I think that having an affair with your girlfriend's 15-year-old daughter is a good thing or appropriate, you can see how a situation like this could happen (especially in that household). The fact that he could take a character like Monroe and make him so likable, convinces me that this is his best performance to date.

Minnie is the kind of girl that loves to be touched and show affection. She is a highly talented girl that has so much going on around her, and she is receptive to take it all in. I'm happy to see the way that the director/screenplay writer Marielle Heller told her story. I had heard some people said there were cringe-worthy scenes, but I didn't feel that way.

Sure there are plenty of sex and drug scenes in the movie but they are done fairly quickly and with respect and are essential to the story. There is humor throughout and lots of animation in the style of Phoebe Gloeckner and Aline Kominsky.

As I said earlier, I didn't care for the characters in the book as much as I did in the film. Bel Powley is SUPERB as Minnie (you never do detect her natural British accent). Kristen Wiig still plays an awful mother, but you can tell she cares, but in her own way. Christopher Meloni was a caring and humorous ex-step-father. I also enjoyed Madeleine Waters as Kimmie and Margarita Levieva as Tabatha which were two of the characters I particularly didn't like in the book.

Marielle's take on the book was superb. This was a passion project for her and it shows. I hope to see more of her work in the future.

Brandon Trost won the Cinematography award at Sundance and you will see why. It just doesn't feel like any other movie I have seen. It is such a stand-out film.

THE DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL was an excellent movie. In all, I went to see it 6 times loving it each & every time. I also enjoyed the soundtrack. The film may not be suitable to see with the family, but definitely worth a watch or two! It did get a lot of recognition and awards but I feel that is still underrated. No one else could have made this as perfect as Marielle Heller did. She had every piece in place to create a masterpiece.

I'm especially looking forward to owning the Blu-ray because of all of the extras that are on it. Can't wait!",1451088000,17,3308,4.332794830371567

7513784,1,B017RR79FM,"If you're looking for drivel on DVD, you've found it here. Generally boring, drug-filled romp pretending to be a ""coming-of-age"" film. How pathetically sad to see Kristen Wiig selling out to using the tobacco drug, which should never be allowed in any movie. Interesting that someone wisely decided to optically remove the tobacco drug from Kristen's hand in the cover art - thank you.

7513785,4,B017RR79FM,"""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" (2015 release; 102 min.) brings the story of Minnie, a 15 year old. As the movie opens, we are informed that it is ""San Francisco, 1976"", with Minnie starting an audio diary (on cassette tapelook it up, young ones!). We soon learn that Minnie just had sex with her mom's boyfriend. It stirs all kinds of emotional feelings and confusion in Minnie (""I wish I was older than I am, I am so alone"" sighs Minnie). At this point we are a good 10 min. into the movie. Will Minnie's mom find out? What will become of Minnie? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the big screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Phoebe Gloeckner. I have not read the novel, so I can't comment how closely the movie stuck to the novel. Second, this is the feature-length directing debut of Marielle Heller, who also wrote the script. I have to say Heller did a more than spectacular job, as she had to do a very delicate balancing act between portraying the confusion of a young lady struggling with sexual feelings on the one hand, and coming across as exploiting them on the other hand. Third, the acting performances will blow you away: Minnie is played by Bel Powley, an up-and-coming British TV actress making her big screen debut, and I would expect Powley to collect quite a few honors when the award season comes around later this year and in early 2016. Minnie's mom, the free-wheeling Charlotte, is played by Kirsten Wiig, as you have never seen her before. I can't wait for Wiig to take on more dramatic roles. Fourth, the movie is a fantastic time piece from the mid-70s, check out the Polaroid, the references to Patti Hearst, the cars, etc. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a bunch of great songs, and thankfully they are for the most part not the same ol' tried-and-true 70s classics, but instead some songs that you will think ""hey, I haven't heard that in forever!"". The movie's incidental orchestral score is courtesy of Nate Heller (Marielle's brother). Check out the outstanding soundtrack (available on Amazon).

Tis movie made quite a splash at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. I couldn't wait to see it and when it finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati a couple of months ago, I went to see it right away. The early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to say. This is the type of movie that, given the great word-of-mouth it is likely to get, might become a hit on the art-house theater circuit. If you are in the mood for something that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, please check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1447545600,16,2890,4.54510556621881
7513786,4,B017RR79FM,"Lets face it, the ladies are getting their due especially when it comes to coming of age style films.  Were used to the guys, constantly horny, trying and often failing at sexual conquests, excluding self-gratification.  This movie had me squirming from the opening scene where we see a smiling Minnie (Bel Powley) walking down the street but verbally transcribing into her diary, details about her first sexual experience.  Oh and shes only 15.

It turns out that her lover is Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard), the 35-year old boyfriend of her mother, Charlotte (Kristen Wiig).  Now before you decide to hide your eyes and ears, it may help (probably not) to know that the setting is 1976 San Francisco and that Ms. Powley was actually 22 during the filming.  As perverted as this all sounds, the movie keeps the taboo subject as light as possible.  Thanks to a terrific performance by the British born Powley, the film could have easily gone over the edge.

Charlotte is a product of the times and location.  She loves her daughters, Minnie and the younger Gretel (Abby Wait) whose father is never disclosed.  Still, shes a free spirit, both with her friends and drugs.  Minnie is anxious to explore her sexual awakening as well as her artistic talents.  The film is told from Minnies perspective which keeps the film somewhat grounded as far as the ick factor.  And to be clear, director, Marielle Heller (also co-wrote with Phoebe Gloekner) doesnt pull any punches in terms of language, sex and nudity so be forewarned.  At the same time, I never felt like this was a movie about sexual exploitation but one of the complexities of growing up from a female perspective.  Recommended for all but the prudish.",1447200000,15,1706,4.834482758620689

7513879,4,B017RR79FM,"Overall, I liked the movie because it reiterates the powerful need of power, love and self-worth. There are disturbing scenes so I would recommend for 30 years old or older! The concept of the movie is about a young girl who finds her worthiness in an older man. This older man boosted her self-worth. However, its only a few times of sex she realizes she does not know what love is and still lacks self-worth. I enjoyed the concept of the movie in observing how sexual sin led her to an endless pit. In real life many mothers would have been jealous of their child and not take them back, or she would have been raped and scarred for life, or would not have been able to run away from a potential pimp, or boyfriend would be in jail, or she would have anything from STDs, had to have an abortion and/or pregnant. This kind of exploration has fatal consequences, unlike portrayed in the movie. This movie also portrays the warped way of thinking of people wanting to be wanted, or worshipped. After sex the main character was still left perplexed if she was loved or worthy. Overall, I liked the movie because it reiterates the powerful need of power, love and self-worth  and if learned correctly that can only be found through your Creator. Ideally, worthiness should be found in God  then when the worthy guy comes along you will recognize him. Then you will marry and have all the sex you want, however many times a day  and afterwards know you are loved by your partner, yourself and God.",1512950400,,1493,4.501845018450185

The problem is that the character's feelings and emotions are lost in the movie, or at least I thought so. In the book, we know that Monroe is such a jerk, but in the movie, he seems way too nice to Minnie (this is compared to how he was in the book). Also, there are some pretty big differences between the book and movie, and some parts (which I thought were pretty important) were left out of the movie completely. Of course, this is a bit of a biased review because I'm not sure how I would've felt about it had I not read the graphic novel, but for anyone who's watching this because they enjoyed the graphic novel, these are just some things to consider.",1473120000,9,834,4.251572327044025

7514033,5,B017RR79FM,"Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015, dir Marielle Heller)

Bel Powley has pillow lips and enormous eyes, wide and nicely spaced; her eyes do her acting for her the way that, back in Hollywoods Golden Age, Bette Davis eyes worked for her: slightly protruding, always alert, they register the slightest emotion like a thunderbolt has hit the screen; the nervous system jumping into a system of visual shows and tells that can get fatiguing after awhileat least people got tired of Bette Davis, and refused her Oscars for All About Eve and The Night of the Iguana, but Bel Powley doesnt have to worry about middle age yet, she has it all over Kristin Wiig, who plays her mother in Diary of a Teenage Girl, the new feature based on Phoebe Gloeckners renowned 2002 graphic novel, and laid, like Tales of the City, in the San Francisco of the Bicentennial years: fern bars, promiscuous sex, and young people living by their wits while confronting the slightly sinister charms of their more seasoned love partners.

Powley plays Minnie, a school girl attending what looks like the Harvey Milk Photo Center on Scott Street, but must be a private prep school like the one Alysia Abbott attends in Fairyland, her own memoir of growing up fast as the daughter of a flighty, drug-addled parent.  Wiig is perfectly fine playing the mother, but the screenplay gives her only one scene (sort of like the Bechtel test) in which shes not interacting either with Minnie or with Monroe, her adorable boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgaard).  Well, hes sort of adorable, but the movie opens with Minnie, who looks like shes fifteen or soa Bette Davis sort of 15announcing that shes just had sex for the first time, with her moms boyfriend.  I actually think they fudge Minnies age a little bit in the movie, while they make Monroe more sympathetic than he is in the book, and the drug and sex scenes, while hypnotic and well handled, are nowhere near as existential as in Gloeckners original.  Theres a Hitchcock-type appearance by Gloeckner who appears seated at a fern bar, shocked by what she overhears from Wiig, Powley and Skarsgaard having one of their showdown scenes, but she might almost be registering, What happened to my monsters?

I was enchanted by the way the movie made San Francisco look as if forty years of development had been shaved off like a bad perm.  I spent the summer in San Francisco in 1976, the summer Elvis died, I was here, and the filmmakers have it almost exactly the way I remember.  I didn't like the cat, Domino, much.  But Domino, like Kristen Wiig, gets sort of short-changed in the movie.  He has one big scene within the first minutes of the picture, when Minnie asks him Do I look different today now that Ive had sex than I did yesterday? and he makes a revolted facethe only piece of CGI in the movie that doesnt succeed.  And then you never see him again.  Most of the time cats in movies just get bigger and better feels every time they appear.  The movie is a triumph for the actors and director, it hurts but not too much, and it looks fantastic, but that darn cat must belong to someone on the set who has an overinflated opinion of his beauty and talent.  Its like Darryl F. Zanuck trying to persuade the public that Irina Demick or Genevieve Gilles is a great actress.  Just doesnt fly.",1471996800,2,3304,4.612627986348123

7514088,3,B017RR79FM,"Despite the raves of critics no doubt more schooled than I, I could not love this movie.  Just about the only reason to watch it is Bel Powley (Minnie), whose ""diary"" (spoken into a cassette, like a good '70's teenager) is explored in this indie flick.  Minnie (Bel Powley) is a young teenager with bad self-esteem not helped by her dysfunctional family situation.  She, like many young girls, feels ""ugly"", especially compared to her ""gorgeous"" mother, Charlotte (Kristen Wiig), and is longing for love in all the wrong places.  The free love, drug-using culture of the seventies in San Francisco give her license, apparently, to come onto her mother's handsome boyfriend, Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard), who looks kind of like a lounge lizard in this scenario.  It does not take much encouragement from Minnie to draw this drifter and troublingly likable pervert into a full-fledged affair.  One watches in horror (or at least I did) as Minnie flexes her sexual muscles and becomes increasingly drawn into a world that is way over her head.  The language, needless to say, is raw, and one wonders of the casting director chose Powley because she looks even more cherubically young than her character was supposed to be.  I felt the performances were fine, especially Powley, but the subject matter so distasteful, I could not engage.  The comic book angle just seemed tacked on to make it seem like a fantasy.  Not a big recommendation on my part.",1467158400,,1447,4.917695473251029

To those parents out there who might care, this movie is borderline NC-17, by the way, with many graphically obvious sexual situations.  Besides that, the cast is strong and the story kept me interested to the end.

I have found in general that many Americans are far more uncomfortable with sex than violence (just check out the ratings for films here and in in Europe).  And this movie has a lot of sex, much of it statutory rape.  This movie not comfy, or funny, or the sort of thing to watch if you just want to chill.

If you are willing to address these issues this movie is an eye opening experience for teenagers who have never understood how young girls can end up in relationships with much older men.  If you have thinking older teens, this movie will spark a great deal of conversation.
 My daughter has been talking about it for days, about how Minnie was just looking for affection and love and mistook sex for meeting those needs.  She clearly saw that the stepfather was using her, and placed the blame for the inappropriate relationship squarely on his shoulders but also understood that Minnie thought she was getting something from the relationship.  The character of the mother was also complex, and it was her lack of affection for Minnie also fed into her lack of self-esteem.  We have spent a great deal of time talking about the relationships in this movie, and the conversations show me that my daughter is processing the complexity of the movie well.

The acting was superb,  the filming fantastic.  But this is not an easy film to watch because it very clearly shows the confusion experienced by a teen who is dealing with her own sexuality, issues of self esteem and the less than respectable behavior of her stepfather.",1458000000,,1712,4.6072607260726075

Its a blessing to have come to a place where I truly love that 15 yr old me, not just despite, but FOR her mistakes, embarrassments, and brutal emotionality that, at the time, felt nearly too much to endure!

I loved the animation.

I could never sit through this movie a second time, the first time was too much.

I enjoyed it because it held my attention and I have never seen this type of story, so I guess I enjoyed it because of the shock value.

SPOILER  ALERT  ..

Minnie is a 15 year old girl in 1976.
The movie opens with her talking into a tape recorder about how excited she is because she has just had sex for the first time.
We find out that she gave her virginity to her mother's boyfriend.
The movie continues with Minnie sleeping around with several different people (including having a threesome and getting paid for oral sex), getting drunk, doing all kinds of drugs, and constantly making poor choices and letting everyone use her.

Minnie has a very low self-esteem and just wants to be loved, but she does not give love to anyone else to get love back.
She thinks that if a guy has sex with her, then maybe he loves her, and maybe he wants her, and maybe that makes her attractive,
but she can't see that he is just using her and he would go with just about anyone who would lie down with him.
She even wondered if having sex meant that she was now an adult.
No one ever told her that having sex is not being in love.
At no point in the movie did anyone tell her how precious her virginity is, and how she should respect herself,
or even about how dangerous it is to run around with strangers.

The mother suspects that Minnie is having an affair with her boyfriend right under her nose, but she lets herself be in denial.
Maybe she can't believe that her daughter would do that to her.
Maybe she can't believe that her daughter is not a virgin.
But she absolutely could believe that her boyfriend would cheat on her.
The mother eventually finds Minnie's diary tapes, which tell everything that Minnie has been doing.

The mother's reaction was ridiculous.
When the mother said that Minnie should marry him, and when the mother did not even think about getting him arrested, I understood why Minnie lacked self-respect.
But the mother never asked Minnie what she did with her time.
When Minnie disappeared for several days, the mother did not even ask where she had been.
And it certainly was not right for the mother to suggest that Minnie go to a bar with her boyfriend when she was too tired to go out herself.
Minnie got drunk, and I wondered what kind of bar served alcohol to a 15 year old (or even let her in), but maybe things were different in 1976.

The boyfriend was a total creep, a pedophile, a cheater.
He even told Minnie that she is just a child, but he kept having sex with her.
He did not feel any guilt about taking the virginity of a 15 year old and having an affair with her.
He only worried about his girlfriend finding out, but he didn't worry that much.

I was shocked that Minnie sought out an affair with her mother's boyfriend.
It is a common story for a mother's boyfriend to molest or rape a girl.
It may even be common for a girl to flirt with her mother's boyfriend.
But I was shocked that she actually threw herself at him, and actually initiated sex with him, and then continued to have an affair with him when he kept suggesting that they end it.
I can understand wanting a ""father figure,"" but you just don't voluntarily have sex with your mother's boyfriend.
And, of course, Minnie never cared about her mother's feelings in any of this.

I would have written the ending a dozen different ways than the way that it actually ended.",1456012800,,3642,4.328928046989721

Really TDOATG left me feeling sort of the way Kids or Thirteen made me feel. Blistered, cold, and sad. It isn't really the movie's subject matter tiself that made me feel queasy. The central relationship, while illegal, didn't feel all that out of place in this presentation of San Fran in the 70s--the era of free love after all. What did seem odd was the movie's constant nods to female empowerment in voiceover, with the protagonist's journey into some rather thorny territory, to put it lightly, presented without a shred of irony as a sort of handbook for teens experiencing the first pangs of burgeoning sexuality. Critics have lauded the movie for not passing judgement on its characters, something I usually agree with. Let characters speak for themselves is often the way to go. But here it all felt a little nihilistic, and disengenuous, and cold. Scenes of pretty off-putting  'exploration' (a scene with sex for money, for example) were presented as feel-a-little-icky-but-laugh-it-off hjinks that wouldn't be out of place in a normal kid's life. Mostly I just felt bad for the protagonist with her unrepentant drug addicted mother, hedonist friend, and emotionally remote older boyfriend. Ultimately, the movie struck me as more sad than empowering and the whimsical floral texture of the daydreams throughout just felt jarring. Like Miranda July and Larry Clark had a baby, and they left it out in the rain to have sex with a lot of rats.",1455580800,11,1701,4.9475524475524475

7514355,4,B017RR79FM,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Writer/Director Marielle Heller originally adapted the graphic novel The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures by Phoebe Gloeckner for the stage, so she was already quite familiar with the material when she brought it to the silver screen.

The plot is rather simple: 15 year old Minnie Katz (brilliantly played by British actor, 23 year old Bel Powley) is an aspiring cartoonist living with her mother and younger sister in 1976 San Francisco. She keeps an audio diary on her trusty cassette recorder, mainly chronicling her sexual desires, making it clear that she would like to lose her virginity. Her mother Charlotte, a bit of a hippie type, has no time for her boyfriend Monroe (in his late 30s) and suggests that he take Minnie out just for some innocent fun. At a bar, Minnie makes it clear that she would like to have sex with Monroe and soon enough, her desire to lose her virginity is fulfilled. Minnie details all her sexual encounters with Monroe and confides in Kimmie, her fellow teenage friend.

A sub-plot involves Minnie's creative pursuits as a burgeoning cartoonist. She becomes fixated on Aline Kominsky, wife of the counterculture cartoonist, R. Crumb, and mails her a copy of her first series of cartoons, which come to life throughout the narrative. Indeed, the clever combination of the live action characters' obsession with sexuality along with sexual themes illustrated through evocative animated images, lifts the film into the realm of a higher aesthetic.

Heller wisely raises the stakes as Minnie's behavior becomes more self- destructive and her relationship more involved with Monroe. Minnie and Kimmie recklessly pose as prostitutes and give oral sex to two boys they do not know in a bathroom. Fortunately they come to their senses the next day and promise one another never to do such a thing again. For a time, predictably, Minnie becomes overly attached to Monroe, but during a bad acid trip, Monroe tells Minnie he loves her. Again, Minnie's common sense kicks in and she decides to leave him.

The late second act crisis occurs when Charlotte finds Minnie's audio diary and strangely decides that Monroe and Minnie should marry. Completely confused, Minnie runs away for a few days and falls in with an older lesbian woman who introduces her to a man she doesn't trust. Minnie returns to her family older and wiser. When she receives a letter from Aline Kominsky encouraging her to continue seeking a career as an illustrator, Minnie begins selling her comics near the beach. There she runs into Monroe and rebuffs him. The story ends on a positive note as Minnie realizes that you've got to love yourself first and foremost and not depend on others for emotional support.

Normally a simple tale such as this where a teenager has an affair with an older man (and mother's boyfriend to boot) could easily fall into the realm of the bathetic. Unlike some of the typical ""women's pictures"" today (easily influenced by the television soap operas of yesteryear), The Diary of a Teenage Girl manages to rise above predictable formulas and refreshingly addresses sexuality from the female point of view in a manner which we rarely see today in both independent and mainstream cinema. This is a very frank coming of age story which I urge all to see--except avoid the temptation of seeing it with your mother..",1455494400,3,3406,4.904513888888889

7514455,3,B017RR79FM,"**spoilers** - TRIGGER WARNINGS-  Rape, incestual tones, pedophilia, sexual abuse
This is a semi-modern (in thinking), Lolita-esque, glimpse inside the mind of a teenage girl.  It doesn't have to take place in the 1970's, although, it doesn't seem that unfamiliar to growing up in the 80s and 90s, truth be told.

How I related:  Having been a teenage girl, myself, I can attest to the fact that each awkward thought, and hormone induced bad decision, was part of being a teen.

How I was mortified:  Thankfully, I wasn't raped in my teenage years, by a step parent figure.  I understand that this film may be intended to thought provoke, and maybe even to enrage the viewer.  It isn't what I want to pay to see.  There is rampant drug abuse (mother and daughter), graphic sexual scenes depicting prostitution, pedophilia, rape (of teenagers).  I wanted to turn this off 30 minutes in, I didn't because I kept waiting for the film to bring itself to resolution.  I have no problem with the acting, it was stellar.  It took a great deal of talent to bring this story to life.
My issue is with thematic content.  My husband remarked that the film was a non stop teen porn.

She's full on naked with this older man for a good part of the movie, and while the actress was 23 at the time... she is depicting a 15-year-old with a 30-something-year-old. My problem with this movie is more the dark comedy tone. The movie could have worked as a dark comedy if Minnie initially had sex with the boyfriend but then started exploring more with kids her age and thinking that she was the bomb because of her experience with the older guy. She does explore with some kids her age, but it's mostly with the older guy. As is, the story should have handled the topic more seriously. The relationship between Minnie and the older guy is never really treated as a problem...even when she goes down a self-destructive path, it's treated like this minor thing that happened that really isn't a big deal. I watched an interview with the actress and she commented that she liked how the story wasn't about this mistake destroying her life...and while I agree that's important... the relationship between Minnie and the mom's boyfriend is something that would take time to heal from and it's more than just getting drunk at a party or crashing your mom's car. Of course some could argue that things like this happen with girls like Minnie who who has an alcoholic/druggie as a mom, and who isn't really doing much for her daughters...and this may sadly be the truth for many young girls with that family dynamic. However, as is, the tone doesn't work me. That being said... I understand what they were trying to do and I appreciate the movie for that. It's a solid attempt at creating a complex and dynamic story about being a young female. I would say this movie is worth checking out... but just be ready for what you're about to watch.",1453852800,4,2066,4.571428571428571

I could understand if it was sex that was there to make a point, but it's sex, more sex, some lesbian sex, then some more sex thrown on, clearly written by a man because it paints almost every girl in the film as an over-sexed nymphomaniac that craves sex with anyone who will participate...

It's clear where they were TRYING to go, but the sexuality is just SO over the top that it's hard to really watch for the plot line or deeper thought.  Whatever movie reviewers gave this rave reviews are either a.) under-sexed nerds who never got enough in their lifetimes to suit them or b.) simply trying to be ""avante garde""... and failing miserably.

My own teenage existence some thirty years back was filled with some pretty insane sh#t;  my mom is a straight up goody goody ( thank GOD!) So I never had this odd relationship going on but I was with a couple for a while ( that's as far as ill go with that) its just that this movie brought back ALL  of that ; the excitement, the confusion, the sexual awakening,  the emotions that you forget and grow somewhat dim as you get older. I don't want them to grow dim!! I want those powerful emotions back! The feeling that I can take on the world even as it knocks me all around. WOW that's all I gotta say!

7514700,4,B017RR79FM,"Before the advance review screener of the Bluray of this film arrived I was not aware of it. Honestly, based on the title, I would have thought of it as a teen coming of age comedy and passed it by. But while there a few (very few) comic moments in the 102 minute film, it is NOT a comedy. Yes, it is a coming of age film as seen from the female viewpoint and Im not sure that I (as an adult male) can relate to the lead character, Minnie, a 15-year old living with her mother and sister in San Francisco in 1976. Minnie is played by 21-year old British actress Bel Powley, who really hides her accent well).

I often see short reasons for a films rating by the MPAA but Ive never seen one this long. The film is rated R  strong sexual content including dialogue, graphic nudity, drug use language and drinking  all involving teens. Yes, thats a quote  and thats what you get. I am not placing judgement on this,; just pointing it out. The language is very graphic  from the first F-word to the many scenes of sex between the 15-year-old character Minnie and a man twice her age (her mothers boyfriend). This is not a spoiler because it happens in the first 10 minutes.
Ill leave it up to women reviewers to provide their input and now concentrate on the Special Features.

While the BD version includes Deleted Scenes not on the DVD (total about 5 minutes), both the DVD and Blu ray have substantial bonuses. There is a full length commentary with the Director and the two lead actors, a 25 minute Q&A at the LA Film Festival and a 25 minute making of/behind the scenes featurette.

The photography is (I guess) supposed to reflect San Francisco in the 1970s and so had lots of muted colors. Nothing is bright and colorful here. And, even though I watched the Bluray version, the images were not any sharper than they would be on the DVD version.

I did like the film and the acting (when the participants were not having sex) was good. So for me it gets 3  stars but Ill round up to four.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8740271,5,B017RR79FM,I really enjoyed this movie. I loved that she was simultaneously a child growing into an adult world and adult desires and vulnerable because of this but not a victim.,1518220800,,167,4.6
8740272,2,B017RR79FM,"This film is just as it's described: ""A coming-of-age story that is a funny and provocative account of one girl's sexual and artistic awakening, without judgment."" It's well acted and the scene settings are great (San Francisco). The film has won critical and fan accolades. That's why I'm giving it two stars.

On the other hand this film was a box office flop, and I suspect it has something to do with people asking why a film like this was made in 2015. I see that a number of reviewers found it boring, but I don't think that's the problem. This is the problem I had with it: It's about Minnie, a 15-year-old girl who has an ongoing sexual affair with her mom's 35-year-old live-in boyfriend. Everyone, including the mom, gets drunk all the time and takes a lot of drugs, including cocaine and LSD. Minnie has sex with other teen boys and girls, too, and her best friend Kimmie, another 15-year-old girl, sleeps around with adults and teen boys. No one gets in any legal trouble, no one gets pregnant, no one gets addicted, or gets any diseases, or gets depressed, and it ends happily for everyone. I'm not sure how realistic that is and I'm not sure what the point of the story is.

I think the film tries to play it safe by placing it in San Francisco in 1976. The writer and director of this film, Marielle Heller, wasn't even born at the time this story takes place. She seems to be under the mistaken impression that it was okay for 35-year-old men to have sexual affairs with 15-year-old girls (recall the ""without judgment"" aspect of this film). It was statutory rape back then just like it's statutory rape today, though it might be true that statutory rape laws are enforced more often today than in the 1970's. But I can assure you that such laws were enforced in the 1970's. The 1960's and 70's were not a time ""without judgment.""

So why would a female writer and director want to tell a funny, pleasant story about a 15-year-old girl having an affair with her 35-year-old stepfather, especially in 2015 when we're finally acknowledging how much psycho-sexual harm so many adult men have been inflicting on younger or less powerful women? It can't be nostalgia for the 1970's, because Ms. Heller isn't old enough, and like I said, she's mistaken about how it was back then. Is this story a misguided fantasy for Ms. Heller?

Ms. Heller explained that there are a lack of films depicting sexually confident young women. She also wanted to remind people that young girls have sexual thoughts too. Gee, who knew? Where did Ms. Heller explain all this? To the fine reporters at Cosmopolitan magazine - you know, the magazine that's been telling women for decades how to have mind-blowing sex in a million different ways. But why did Heller need to depict a 15-year-old knocking the socks off of her 35-year-old stepfather to get that message out there?

There are a lot of sexually confident 15-year-old boys and girls, because I've seen them on the Jerry Springer and Maury Povich shows getting DNA tests to see who fathered their babies.

Strangely, Ms. Heller doesn't seem to understand the message of the story she presents to the audience. While she intended to remind us that young girls can have sexual feelings and be sexually confident, instead the primary message seems to be that 15-year-old girls can benefit greatly from having affairs with their 35-year-old stepfathers, as long as the stepfathers are ""nice,"" attractive and good lovers. If anyone reading this review disagrees with me, please feel free to post a comment and give me an example of any negative consequence for any of the characters in this film. And if you don't think that Minnie was considerably better off for having the affair, please offer examples of that too. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think so. Ms. Heller, there are good reasons why there aren't too many films showing the benefits to young girls of having sex with their stepfathers. The intended message gets very muddled in this story.

When an intrepid reporter at Cosmo asked Ms. Heller if the film promoted underage sex, she said, ""Nobody criticized the characters in The Godfather for being bad examples of how to be men."" True, but a lot of people got hurt and died in The Godfather, and the message was very clear that organized crime is a terrible scourge on society. In contrast there were happy endings for everyone in this film and there wasn't even a hint that underage sex with adults harms anyone. On the contrary, the film suggests that underage sex with adults is beneficial to everyone.

Ms. Heller also defended her film by saying, ""Movies about teenage girls have this onus of showing perfect people making perfect decisions. And that's not what this movie is about."" The problem is, this film doesn't show any serious negative consequences for any of the imperfect people making imperfect decisions. Indeed, Minnie handles her breakup with her stepfather as well as any mature adult woman might handle a breakup with a boyfriend. She gets on with her life with no trouble at all. (It's not a spoiler to say that Minnie and her stepfather eventually break up. C'mon, you didn't expect them to stay together and live happily ever after like Woody Allen and Soon-Yi, did you?)

I didn't read the graphic novel this film is based on, but according to descriptions the novel features some serious negative consequences that Heller decided to leave out. Isn't that interesting?

Ms. Heller, the next time you want to do a film on the San Francisco scene in 1976, maybe you should consult me. I was there. When I was 19 I had a big crush on a 15-year-old girl, but nothing came of it. I felt guilty even thinking about her in that way, because, believe it or not, that was wrong and illegal even back then, even in loose San Francisco. But gosh, if only I were her 35-year-old stepfather, maybe it would have been great? Your film makes me realize how much I missed out. :-)",1517875200,,5954,4.683556405353729
