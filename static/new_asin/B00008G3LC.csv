7982528,5,B00008G3LC,I absolutely love this video (VHS).  I had formerly had a copy of this video and loaned it to a friend.  It never came back home.  So I was delighted to find another copy available.  It will never leave my possession again!,1250208000,,223,4.238095238095238
7982529,5,B00008G3LC,"THIS ALBUM DESERVES TEN STARS!!!  ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKINGLY GORGEOUS AND WONDERFUL!  The pieces of music are played exceptionally beautifully, and the whole production and presentation is totally first-class and tastefully high-brow!  The performers and performances are amazingly graceful and humbly elegant, and you can just FEEL their radiant joy... it's a great pleasure to see how much they enjoy their music!
The whole album is a colorful tapestry of visual delight from beginning to end, but here are two scenes that I especially got a kick out of:
(1) A ""pre-performance"" shot of two slender elegantly-dressed female musicians... one of the women is powdering up another woman's face prior to their playing a piece together, and the woman having her face done is sitting still and yet is casually talking to the cameraman as if nothing is happening.
(2) A lovely shot from a camera positioned at the end of a row of parallel harps, giving us a ""through-the-harp-strings"" view of a whole long line of slender pretty ladies' hands playing all the harps at once --- take my word for it, folks... it would almost be worth buying the whole album JUST TO SEE THIS PART!",1193702400,2,1171,4.964285714285714

7982531,5,B00008G3LC,"This video is filmed in a very historic castle in Ireland, and once in a while the acoustics become strange. But the talent displyed are well worth overlooking that.  They are all great from the Harp Ochestra (yes, folks, harps can be quite loud!) and they come in all ages and styles which are highlighted in the tape.  It's a lovely overview of the folk harp, which dates back in its present form to the 12th Century.  But there is nothing stuffy or old about these folk... they rock!  And the scenery and backgrounds are lovely indeed.
There are several solo performances that are quite awsome both fo hear as well as see.",1092009600,,625,4.504424778761062
