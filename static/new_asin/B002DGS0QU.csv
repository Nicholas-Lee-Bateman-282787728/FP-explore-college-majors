8365129,5,B002DGS0QU,This is now an app. Very user friendly. Very well done. I use the app all the time.,1417910400,,83,3.6666666666666665
8365130,1,B002DGS0QU,"I suppose there is good information and stretch techniques on the dvd, but it's a nightmare tring to work your way through the menus and find anything. It's NOT a video, but more like a painfully slow Power Point demo.  You have to hit the buttons on the remote several times to get it to respond.  There is no ""routine"".  I expected to work through a stretching routine with a real person.  An antimated person demonstrates each stretch briefly with recommendations and advice.  But at no time (that I ever found on there, do you just work smoothly through a routine of stretches.  And how many people own a low table they can lie on for some of this stuff?  I'm glad I only ordered one of the dvd's.  It was pretty much a waste of money.",1274313600,12,739,4.343065693430657
8365131,5,B002DGS0QU,I found this to be a very good DVD for helping hip and low back pain.,1272240000,2,69,3.375
8365132,4,B002DGS0QU,"I'd been having consistent pain in my leg/hip joint as well as some in the hip that was particularly troublesome at night so it really disturbed my sleep. Doctors, chiropractors, and trigger point therapy only helped for about a week and then it would all start again. I did these exercises and within a few days there was a difference and in about 2 weeks no pain on one side and little pain on the other. Her stretches target deep muscles that typical stretches don't address. You don't have to do all the stretches. I just do the ones that started out as painful and tight.  The cd explains things well but the cd is hard to maneuver; it doesn't return to menu when you push the menu button for some reason.  Nonetheless, the stretches are really valuable.  I've ordered her other cds just because I want to limber up my upper and lower back.",1255219200,13,845,4.438709677419355
8365133,5,B002DGS0QU,"Mary Smithson Hutto helped me years ago with occasional lower back pain by providing instruction on how to  stretch to make the pain go away.  The DVD explains these stretches with out having to travel to Maui every time you need it!

I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone with mild to high back pain as it will make your day vastly better.
