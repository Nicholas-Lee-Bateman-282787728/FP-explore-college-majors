No matter what your age, or present level of fitness, I know you will find, in this course, the recipe for health and general overall wellness, for which you have been searching. The mood is set with a beautiful, calming, ocean and beach background backed by soothing music. Ms. Eastman begins by carefully cautioning her students to  pay close attention to any physical limitations they might have and to tailor their movements accordingly. I believe you will find this is very easy to do, in that accompanying Ms. Eastman, there are two ""models"", a man and an older woman, of widely varying fitness levels, who along with Ms. Eastman, demonstrate and guide you through a wide range of gentle movements, from chair bound exercises, to more advanced, energetic moves. Through mirroring the movements of the person who most closely matches your own fitness level, while following the clear, concise and gentle instructions by Ms. Eastman, you will be able to customize an excellent Qigong routine to do anytime, in the comfort of your own home and at your own speed. There are two separate programs included in this course: one short session and another longer, more advanced program. There is also an extremely relaxing, guided meditation session to be done at the end of which ever program you choose. I'm sure you will find Ms. Eastman's EZ QIGONG MOVEMENTS to be exactly what you need to enhance your life and enable your journey towards  total mind and body, health and wholeness!",1347580800,2,1765,4.88

Take the next step to improving your health with Qigong.",1343779200,3,468,4.329545454545454
8509538,5,B0073XF03O,"I have been meaning to learn Qigong for years, but finally have found an appealing and EZ program by Sheila Eastman that actually makes me look forward to my morning exercises.  This video offers excellent value because Sheila has two Qigong programs plus a ten minute seated guided meditation.  The meditation can be used to relax before sleep or seated in a chair for a break during the day.  If you aren't used to meditating, this is a very helpful visualization for cleansing tension.

The ""EZ"" part of the short and long Qigong programs is definitely appealing, but some moves I found harder than I had imagined they would to keep my balance while moving slowly.  Which is good, because it means a challenge and I am definitely seeing my balance improve as I practice daily.

Sheila does a grand job of making the slow movements and the co-ordinated breathing clear and understandable.  Having her two students with her really helped to allow those at different to levels to enjoy the same program. I enjoy the short program before bed and the long program on waking. Doing these on a daily basis will be the key for long term benefit.  Well worth the effort of learning and practicing an art that does so much for one's body and spirit. I am looking forward to Sheila's second DVD in the series.
