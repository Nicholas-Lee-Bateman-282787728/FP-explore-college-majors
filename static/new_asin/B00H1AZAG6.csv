8629097,5,B00H1AZAG6,"I absolutely love this work out.  I am 60 years old with arthritis in my back and hip and I just had arthroscopic knee surgery 7 weeks ago.  After I finished my physical therapy I started doing this DVD and am in love with it.
I have done other exercises, including yoga class and have always ended up with some kind of injury or increased pain.  With this work out it is actually helping the chronic pain I have in my hip because it is strengthening my glutes and my core.  The small moves Sadie does in her workout are incredibly strengthening even though you aren't doing huge moves that can hurt your joints.
I would highly recommend this work out.  This coming from someone who sees a pain specialist for my joint problems.  My pain has actually improved dramatically with this DVD.",1422662400,13,787,4.468531468531468
8629098,5,B00H1AZAG6,A nice 30 min all standing barre routine from the master Sadie Lincoln!,1411948800,6,71,4.538461538461538
8629099,5,B00H1AZAG6,"This workout is taught by Sadie Lincoln, the founder of Barre 3.  This is a 30 minute workout.  The equipment needed:  waist-high surface for balance, light weights, barre3 core ball.  All exercises are done standing.

My only regret was that it ended too soon.  I was wishing for more.  I usually pair the Barre 3 workouts with some cardio, so I am working out for an hour.
The workout is divided into three 10 minute segments, so you can make this work for your schedule, especially if you only have a little bit of time.

The three 10 minute segments are:

* WARM UP AND YOGA FLOW

I love how Sadie uses yoga flows to gently warm up the body.  The flow is a typical yoga one; you move from sun salutations to Warrior 1 to Warrior 2, while using gentle movements to further stretch the body.

* LEGS AND UPPER BODY

Sadie uses light weights (2 pounds).  You do an upper body exercise like bicep curls or triceps extensions, all while doing leg squat variations.

* GLUTES AND STRETCH

The glute work is the standing on one leg while you have the ball behind the knee of your other leg.  You then do various lifts of the bent leg.

The finale is a well-deserved two minute stretch.

This workout is definitely a keeper.  You work your muscles, but you don't really sweat a lot, so you could do this in the office.",1400976000,21,1314,4.329218106995885
