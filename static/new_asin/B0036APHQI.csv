Other DVDs are as advertised.  Wish there was a way Amazon could replace the one bad , counterfeit ,,disk.  The DVD case arrived broken but discs playable.",1498694400,,306,4.315789473684211
8389714,5,B0036APHQI,My son Wyatt has been begging to get the movie City of Ember after he read the series.  He liked the movie but as usual wasn't as good as the book.  It was a bonus to get two more family movies for the price of one.,1483401600,,215,3.652173913043478

8389716,5,B0036APHQI,"I ordered this because I had read the book to my students, and wanted to share the video with them.  It arrived very quickly, and was exactly as advertised.  I will consider buying from them when I need other videos.",1322006400,,216,4.375
8389717,4,B0036APHQI,"My kids really like City of Ember and Nim's Island. Both are acted well and appropriate for elementary and middle age school kids. Eragon was not done well, and the book is excellent. Die hard fans will be mad it is different than the book and non-readers will find the plot confusing.

So buy this set, knowing that 2/3 are good, and for the price of the set, you are getting a steal.",1296518400,,385,4.273972602739726
8389718,4,B0036APHQI,"There are many reviews about these individual movies, to I thought I would take the time to add one on this 3 movie set.  It appears that there is nothing unique (or special) about the format of the movies in this set.  You get the same thing if you were to buy these individually, but now at a cheaper price in a handy case.

The movies:

1.)  Nim's Island --  a great family film worth watching many times!  This is one of those great movies to watch on a rainy day when there is nothing else to do.  The movie is worth watching just for Jodie Foster alone, but Abigail Breslin is absolutely adorable and a great actress.  There are not really any major surprises in the movie and the ending is just slightly above average, but overall a great family film and one you can let your kids enjoy.  My 4 year old was interested all the way through.  Oh, and there are great extras on this disc with two commentaries!  Overall, I give this one 4 stars!

2.)  Eragon -- There are many negative reviews on this movie and for good reason!  The plot is confusing, the characters are poorly identified, the dragon is just plain goofy in parts, and the special effects are average.  The main reason I didn't like this one is because it is just plain evil (in my opinion).  I do NOT think this is a good family film, nor one for children.  It would probably give the average young child many nightmares!  No language in this film, but a pathetic ending.  I give this one only 2 stars!!

3.)  City of Ember -- Honestly, this movie is worth the whole collection and if it wasn't for Nim's Island....I'd say just buy this one by itself.  This is a HIGHLY underrated film.  The set design is amazing, the characters are fantastic, and the plot is just plain fascinating.  This movie WILL keep you on the edge of your seat.  The movie leaves a lot to the imagination and many unanswered question, but I actually like it that way.  The ending is a bit simple, but I'm not sure it could have been any different based on how the story is supposed to end.  Unfortunately, there is no EXTRAS on this disc (but it did come double-sided for wide and full screen options).  I would have loved some interviews and a commentary, but not on this!  You can find interviews on youtube.  I give this one 4 1/2 stars!

Overall, this 3 disc package is worth your money (I paid about $12 at Sam's Club)!  Buy it, then throw away the Eragon movie!",1289779200,3,2413,4.314732142857143
