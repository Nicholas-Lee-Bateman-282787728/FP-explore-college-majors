8359521,2,B002AIMSXC,"This film is a project of Gil Branco, the producer, director, and star. He wants to film his last bodybuilding competition, on Muscle Beach. I have never heard of this guy at all, in terms of the bodybuilding sport. He was competing in NPC amateur contests, and aside from being very thin, and having abs, he does not have any major muscle tone, and his legs look like he has never worked them out in his life.

The funny thing is that he tries to make this movie as if he were Arnold Schwarzeneggar retiring from the sport of bodybuilding. However, he is a funny guy, and he is usually laughing or joking around, so you get the feeling that he knows it is just for fun, and that makes this video go pretty fast.

He has a lot of scenes of training and going out with his girlfriend, and he really does not give too many training tips or otherwise provide any good information regarding what, if anything, he has been doing. That would have made this video much better, as a serious training tool.

However, the interesting part of this video is that Branca travels around to various Texas and California gyms where there are well known competitors. Some of them are interviewed, and it is interesting to see them training. He also goes to the Arnold Classic, in Ohio, and interviews a few of the old time bodybuilders, and some current competitors.

Overall, this film is mildly interesting, and entertaining if you are a fan of bodybuilding and powerlifting. It is definitely not a training video, and it is not a hardcore weightlifting video where you are going to see a lot of lifting and discussion of lifting.

This video is basically an old-time travelogue, where you get to hang around with Branca as he visits all the places (Muscle Beach, Venice, Arnold Classic, etc.) that he thinks are at the top of the bodybuilding and powerlifting sport.",1358812800,,1852,4.5830815709969785
