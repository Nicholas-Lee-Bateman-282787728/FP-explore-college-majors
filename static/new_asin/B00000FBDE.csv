7908471,4,B00000FBDE,"I watched this because I saw a few of my favorite actors were in it.  I was not expecting much so finding a good story with a good twist in it was a pleasant surprise.  It is well worth a second watch ( if only to watch McCaffrey again). It is a bit dated, cells phones are huge and files are still kept in cabinets not computers, but It was a trip back to the 90's and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1452988800,,394,3.8518518518518516
7908472,4,B00000FBDE,"A real sleeper that appears to be a bigger budget movie then it is.
But is was shot by Vance Piper, who usually works on big budget movies.
A hidden jewel . . . !",1231200000,,162,3.657142857142857
7908473,4,B00000FBDE,"This is a very well-made film marked by solid direction and acting. The script is linear, suspenseful and leisurely enough to permit character development. Although James McCaffrey seems rather wan as someone to be desired, performances by John Glover (excellent as usual) and Polly Draper more than make up for him. The scoring was effective and the blocking unobtrusive. Newport Beach was perfectly cast. The ending was more layered than is immediately obvious. Although this effort is underrated and largely forgotten, an opportunity to purchase it will be rewarding.",1105574400,,570,5.415730337078652
7908474,1,B00000FBDE,"I have to say this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  When we finally figured out what seemed to be the plot of the first half, we were again befuddled as the second half of the movie appeared to have nothing to  do with the first half.  Characters found out things, had epiphanies,  seemed surprised and all, but it was difficult to tell why they were  surprised, all they did was see a beat up car!  The acting was particularly  shoddy, but it was well done compared with the choppy editing, confusingly  split screens, and lack of cohesive plot or convincing conclusion.  Lots of  people standing around in the same room at the end of a movie does not an  oscar win.  Unfortunetly, neither does it satisfy the watcher, or even give  them a clear idea of what they just watched.  This wasn't an artsy film  either where you expect that.  I left with the feeling someone took a pair  of scissors to the reel of a movie, and I was watching what was left.",947376000,,966,4.307262569832402
