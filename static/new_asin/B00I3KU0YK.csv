6248231,1,B00I3KU0YK,"found this film a sad, pathetic and whiny piece of trash.  Michael Landon was a beautiful loving man who deserved better children thAn what he got.  May God forgive michael Landon me for not honoring his father.  No Reason the whole family was angry at him for this film. It's awful and he claims to love his father.  Ha!!",1436918400,2,322,4.406779661016949
6248232,5,B00I3KU0YK,I LOVED THIS MOVIE WHEN IT CAME ON TV IN 1999. I LOVE IT MORE NOW THAT I OWN IT ON DVD. I HAD IT ON A RECORDED VHS TAPE. I'M SO GLAD I HAVE FOUND IT HERE. IT JUST MAKES MY DAY! THANK YOU!!!,1429574400,4,189,3.2222222222222223
6248233,5,B00I3KU0YK,"Surprised to find this dvd.  The title was a little different than the original, but the story turned out to be one that I found to be informative, believeable and a credit to the son of Michael Landon. His direction and the writing of his father's story from Michael Jr'.s viewpoint were done with sensitivity and thoughtfulness.  Where you may not care for this description of Mike Senior, it does present Mike Jrs version of the way life had been.
Well done and worth the purchase.",1424649600,10,484,4.616279069767442
8638682,3,B00I3KU0YK,"Overall this was a good movie. I knew ML had issues, but this movie definitely shows that he did towards his children after he left his wife Lynn for wife #3.
I don't find that MLJr. made this movie to ""smear"" his dad, he made it to let people know the true personality of his father.",1530921600,,284,4.089285714285714
8638683,5,B00I3KU0YK,"After reading the book by Michael Landon Jr's sister, the movie was a good supplement to the story. It was portrayed truthfully, and lovingly, and I'm happy to have seen it.",1519689600,,173,4.612903225806452
8638684,1,B00I3KU0YK,This movie is about Michael Landon yr not Michael Landon sr he blames his Father for everything and yet there is no mention of his mother's trying to be a Hollywood want to be wife this movie just sucks,1518220800,,202,4.205128205128205
8638685,5,B00I3KU0YK,"This was a very informative movie, about Micheal's life, wrote by his son. I learned a lot from watching, about Michael Landon and his family. Very good movie.",1518048000,,159,4.714285714285714
8638686,4,B00I3KU0YK,Yes perfect thanks,1516838400,,18,5.333333333333333
8638687,4,B00I3KU0YK,Good story. Didn't care for old Dukes of Hazard playing Michael Landon.,1500249600,,71,5.0
8638688,5,B00I3KU0YK,This was really a good story that Michael Landon's son told in the movie!,1498608000,,73,4.285714285714286
8638689,5,B00I3KU0YK,"The movie is excellent and quite courageous.  Michael Landon seems to have spent most of his public life trying to convince people that he was some sort of saintly person.  When I saw this movie, I was able to say to myself ""your impression of Landon was correct.""  Basically I always thought he was ""full of it"" so to speak, a giant ego pretending to be a wonderful person.  I hated that sanctimonious look on his face all through Little House on the Prairie and Highway to Heaven.  What a total jerk and thanks to his son for telling the truth about him.",1489363200,2,556,4.359223300970874
8638690,5,B00I3KU0YK,Enjoyed it very much.,1468972800,,21,4.5
8638691,3,B00I3KU0YK,"The actors in this film do a fine job and it is of good quality but the story can leave the viewer a bit drained. If you are huge LHOTP, or Michael Landon fan you may want to steer clear.  It could take you a little while to recover from the truth about his life.",1464825600,3,263,3.7818181818181817
