7834750,4,6303001718,"I remember seeing this a while ago and it was a kick seeing Joanna Kerns (sexy actress indeed), play a total bitch.  It was a nifty little dark cracker, but I have recently bought the dvd release and I noticed that cuts were made for some mild flashes of nudity; simply Joanna's backside getting up. I know it was a tv film, but that's no excuse for these cuts, and it means the censors still treat everyone like kids.  It's not good enough.  I'm not keeping the film.  I want to, but I refuse.  I am sick of these censors.  Release the film properly will you! It deserves better and it ruined it for me!",1282953600,6,604,4.208695652173913
7834751,4,6303001718,Let's not forget that this is a made for TV movie.  I remember seeing this on TV but never finished it until it came out on DVD.  I remember it because Joanna Kerns played a role I had never could have envisioned her in.  She made the movie and it was indeed entertaining and at times kept you glued.  The ending is unique.  Could not give it a five because I could not imagine paying close to $30 for it as I did not pay that amount for a TV movie.,1265760000,2,449,3.89010989010989
7834752,5,6303001718,"a nifty, twisty little movie with a terrific performance by Joanna Kerns, best know as the mom on ""Growing Pains"" - but there is nothing warm or fuzzy about her mom in this film - wonderful sense of place & time - i was really happy to see this come out on DVD - watched it as soon as it arrived in the mail & was overjoyed that it was as good as i remembered it being when i caught it on tv so many years ago",1185321600,4,409,3.7126436781609193
7834753,4,6303001718,"The usually June Cleaveresque Joanna Kerns takes a turn at steamy soft erotic drama in THE NIGHTMAN, directed by Charles Haid (""Renko"" of ""Hill Street Blues"" fame).
The story concerns the sexual competitiveness of Kerns, as the mother/older woman proprietress of a run-down lakeside summer hotel, and Jenny Robertson as her daughter/Lolita. Both women vy for the attention of Ted Marcoux, who plays the young, irresistibly virile handyman/night manager of the hotel.
Kerns is unbelievably sensual and indubitably bitchy in her role, while the gamine Robertson fairly oozes hormones. Marcoux, as the Nightman of the title, is trapped between them, and is forced to make a choice. It is a decision which comes back to haunt him eighteen years later, when Robertson, now a psychologist, confronts him about occurrences at the hotel that long-ago humid summer.
Underrated, low-budget, and peopled with unknowns, without being explicit THE NIGHTMAN nonetheless manages to maintain a level of moody, stimulating tension throughout, which is hardly matched by most ""adult"" films.",1074211200,5,1072,5.463855421686747
