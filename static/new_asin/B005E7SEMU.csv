4663820,5,B005E7SEMU,This movie is not just about horses. It's also about/applies to people too. Loved this movie! Very touching and educational too.  My husband and I would recommend this to all ages.  Wish every horse trainer would buy this.,1313366400,3,222,4.815789473684211

4663822,5,B005E7SEMU,"I saw this movie today in San Antonio. What a fine documentary, not only about a man's love of horses, but the amazing triumph of his own spirit over adversity.  This is a must see even if you have never even ridden a horse. Much of it beautifully filmed in Montana; places familiar to me. I am so pleased this movie is doing well. The DVD will be an excellent Christmas present. Highly recommended",1312761600,4,398,4.378378378378378
4663823,5,B005E7SEMU,This is one great movie of Buck's horse training experiences. I have trained some horses in the past and only wish I had a small percentage of Buck's training experiences. From a troubled childhood to a very successful horse trainer he has accomplished much in his lifetime. Great movie for all to watch!,1312588800,3,304,4.754716981132075
4663824,5,B005E7SEMU,I too liked this movie. I need not repeat what others have said about it. Buck is one of several cowboys of his generation who tour around the country helping people with their horses. A couple others of note are Craig Crawford and John Lyons. Buck's store is well told and documented in this movie. These guys are not what we have been trained to expect in the movies. No drunk horses falling down or getting shot in this movie. What is in it are real stories about real horses with problems and people problems. Horses are not pets and should not be treated as such. Many are treated like dogs but and can become dangerous. The movie tells Buck's story while telling the story of the American Cowboy who is at risk of disappearing. Hopefully a few youngsters will see this and become inspired become what Buck is.,1311379200,,815,4.476510067114094
4663825,5,B005E7SEMU,"Just returned from seeing this movie; an amazing individual who overcame personal struggles in his own life to become a successful and inspirational figure in the horse world with his training tecniques.  A lesson in how creatures respond to respect and dignity which can be carried over into
how we humans treat each other.  Highly recommend this movie to everyone!",1311206400,3,366,5.083333333333333
4663826,5,B005E7SEMU,"For me, this movie was as much about respect as it is about training horses. Buck's scene's and narratives about specific training issues and techniques are certainly fascinating but it is his approach to animals and people that enables him to do what he does so successfully. Clearly, he respects for all animals and all people and expects the same in return. He treats all beings with the same patient, gentle - and often humorous - approach, quietly insisting that they strive to be the best that they can be.
The movie is beautifully filmed and the scenery is breathtaking but it is Brannaman's own story that catches and holds our attention. I suspect that the movie would have been much different if produced and directed by men rather than women. Only by understanding Buck's background and his own struggles to gain self-confidence and respect can we fully embrace his approach to life and training. He doesn't use ""canned"" techniques; all animals are individuals to be treated with dignity and respect. The documentary is informative but not at all ""preachy"" as Brannaman's quiet sense of humor prevails throughout. Certainly, this film is of great interest to the ""horsey"" set but it is a wonderful lesson in life and learning for viewers of all ages and all backgrounds.",1311206400,2,1281,4.907834101382488
4663827,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck Brannaman is the ""real enchilada"", a man for whom it would seem the term, ""cowboy"" was coined. Enduring beatings from their abusive tyrannical father, Buck and his brother were professional trick ropers by the time Buck was 4 1/2. After their mother's death, authorities finally removed the boys from their dark home life. Through the love of his foster parents, Buck managed to leave his haunted past behind, though not without heavy scarring, on his soul as well as his body.

As one of the interviewees pointed out during the movie, perhaps ""tortured souls"", such as she calls Buck, have a special sensitivity to the horses they help that the average trainer lacks. Whatever it is, Buck's feel for the horse has enabled him to help thousands of horses with their ""people problems"", as he is won't to call them. ""Buck"" follows Brannaman as he takes to the road for nine months of each year, giving 2-day clinics all over the country. There is even footage of his daughter, Riata and her girlfriend, as they accompany him for part of the time, as well as Mary Brannaman, Buck's wife of many years.

Fans of Buck Brannaman will slurp this movie up like a kid eating ice cream on a hot day. But its appeal is far broader than just for those who love horses. Scenery is excellent, the music is catchy, and there are scenes of working cattle, Californios roping with Buck and Riata, and what most fans probably are looking for, Buck doing his thing with horses with issues. More than this, though, is the weaving of Buck's past through the film, along with footage of some of the Western horse world's greats, such as Tom Dorrance and Ray Hunt, mentors of Brannaman.

As if all this weren't enough, ""Buck"" shows how oftentimes clinics are about more than getting a handle on your horse. As Buck says, the horse is our mirror. Owners' issues are reflected quite accurately in their horses' attitudes and actions. And when Buck begins to pull threads on the horse, you can just about bet, one or two ends will be firmly attached to the owner. Tears and other emotions often rise to the surface, and people usually find they learn more than they'd imagined they would, at day's end. Sensitive he may be, but Brannaman pulls no punches when it comes to giving ""tough love"" to his clients. If they ask, he will tell them what they need to hear, which is many times far different from what they may want to hear!

""Buck"" is nicely done; not too long, with just the right mix of lightness, humor, and drama to keep viewers' interest high. And ultimately, the scenes of Buck on a horse just shouldn't be missed. No one sits a horse like Buck Brannaman! See it; you'll be glad you did! I can't wait for the DVD!!!!",1310256000,71,2707,4.563786008230453
4663828,5,B005E7SEMU,"This was a ""no holds barred"" documentary during which Buck candidly shares his thoughts on many subjects, not only those related to horses.  Having had a troubled childhood, Brannaman matured into a really fine adult who has helped a lot of horses, as well as many people.  The sequence near the end of the movie shows that some horses are actually beyond help.  However, during most of the movie we can see how well he handles horses that others find to be problematic.  He has real respect for the animals and, in most cases, they seem to appreciate it and respond in kind.  This movie should appeal to more viewers than simply horse lovers.

And no, that's not how you properly sack out a green horse, by scaring and threatening him into attacking. Why give the horse to his idiot Assistant instead of working with the horse himself?  Too scared?? Could have told the owner to geld and sell him, could have offered to take the horse and just pull his shoes and turn him out to pasture with older horses (he's got plenty of land) or give him to Klaus  Hempflinger or Frederic Pignon or several other real ""horse whisperers"".

4663856,5,B005E7SEMU,Buck (aka the Horse Whisperer) has been a champion for horses and giving them the right training from the start. Knowing his background and the struggles he went through as a child I'm sure gave him the insight he has for helping a troubled horse. It was enlightening to see how his life has progressed from there.

4663974,1,B005E7SEMU,"This review has nothing to do with the quality of this effort as a film. As an avid, aspiring trainer of horses I was most interested in learning about Brannaman's approach to 'natural horsemanship', a training model based on a solid appreciation for how horses 'think', how they conduct themselves within their herd hierarchy. One of the most important fundamentals in this regard is to understand how critically important it is for horses to establish, and continuously re-test, for the position of alpha, the leader of the herd. Nothing is more important as horses are prey animals and their safety as a group is fully dependent on having a sound leader.

The key to the successful training of a horse, ie., the building of a respectful, cooperative relationship between human and horse, is for the human to establish themselves as the alpha. Leverage the horse's deep need for a leader and you've got yourself a brilliant horse who will be respectful and trustworthy. Earning a horse's respect is done by doing what horses do in the wild; horses who physically move other horses about get to be higher up the pecking order, and might get to be the alpha, the leader. Horses do this by exerting physical pressure on other horses; human trainers must do the same. In a herd, horses continuously play 'chicken' with each other; in any showdown, the horse who moves first loses and the 'winner' moves up the herd hierarchy.

As the film proceeded, I was most interested in the sequence involving Brannaman training a difficult horse, one that was very aggressive with humans. The female owner of this horse was coming unglued, having no clue of how to deal with this horse who was clearly convinced that it needed to be the alpha. As such, it was very content to play 'chicken', not only with other horses but with any human it encountered. The horse presented as dangerously aggressive.

Training horses requires much skill with respect to knowing how much pressure to bring to any horse. It is this 'pressure' that horses respond and give to, and knowing how much to bring to any horse is the key to earning their trust, ie., helping them accept the trainer as being worthy of being their leader. Some are very sensitive and require a gentle, low pressure approach. Others, like this one, need a whack of pressure.

In this sequence, Brannaman made, IMO, a critical mistake that resulted in a person being attacked by the horse. Brannaman appeared to do a modest amount of training with the animal but never really earned the horse's respect. He moved the horse about, but he did so by hog-tying one of the horse's hind feet. With it's hind foot tied off, the horse had no choice but to comply with what Brannaman was 'asking' it to do. That's the key: the horse was FORCED to comply, rather than convinced to willingly give his respect and comply. Brannaman ended the session and told the owner to stay clear of the horse. Unfortunately a friend of the owner took it upon himself to get back in the round pen with the horse. The horse, having learned nothing from Brannaman's training session, promptly attacked the human, opening up a small head wound on the guy. The sequence ended with the horse being put on a trailer, and the viewer left with the suggestion that the horse had been deemed unfixable, and sent off to some awful end.

I understand that this horse may indeed have been legitimately nuts, and thus untrainable for productive interaction with humans. The trouble is, there is more that should have been done to give this animal the chance to prove his worth. Instead, it seems he may have been sent off to slaughter.

Two years ago, when I lived in Texas, I met a couple of horse owners who had gone to a Brannaman clinic. When I asked them what they had learned, they looked sheepish, unable to state anything pragmatic or concrete that they had taken from the clinic. They thought he said a lot of impressive, wise-like-Yoda stuff, but they couldn't recite one thing, one training concept or technique that would allow them to better work with their horses. In the film, Brannaman comes off as some form of 'horse whisperer', full of misty, philosophical musings about the gentle majesty of horses. That's lovely stuff for all us horse owners. Unfortunately, he also comes up pretty short on how the hell to actually train the darn things. He might have a great natural feel for most horses, but I didn't see much in the way of a concrete method that regular horse owners could successfully apply themselves. There are certainly other trainers who do provide those tangible benefits. I came away very disappointed in Brannaman's method.

If you're generally keen on animals but not an especially 'horsey' person, this film will certainly tug at your heart strings. It's a decent movie. If you wanted to see what the Brannaman training method was all about, for what it's worth you'll see it here, and I suggest you then look for other options.",1446595200,6,4965,4.732947976878613

4664044,5,B005E7SEMU,"I can't remember when I've loved a movie or a character more, and what's so wonderful about this movie is that it's a true story.  From an abused boy to the man who fixes abused horses, Buck is not just a movie for horse lovers, it's the story of what it means to be human.  They say that everything in life mirrors our subconscious and horses make marvelous mirrors. They are so sensitive and so forgiving, which makes them the idea companions. Dogs to do, but dogs might be too forgiving of our human frailties.  Horses make us work harder at being good people.

Buck is the story of a cowboy(in the truest sense of the word) who learned to tame horses by breaking their spirit. Maybe he identified too much with the abuse heaped on a horse during the 'breaking', so he came up with a better way. Buck is the original 'horse whisper' that was made into a movie staring Robert Redford as Buck.  As Redford said in the movie, ""I fix horses with people problems', Buck too traces the origins of a horse's negative behavior with some sort of abuse heaped on them from a human.

In the movie you see Buck sooth the most troubled horses, except for one.  I hate to give away the ending, so stop reading here if you haven't seen the movie, but one horse had problems that were organic and nature and couldn't be 'fixed'.  The foal was starved for oxygen setting him up on life with a brain that wasn't firing on all cylinders coupled with being left out to be raised by a group of stallions, so he was never taught correct 'horse' social behavior.  The horse finally had to be put down which I could see from the movie just about killed Buck.

Not every problem can be fixed, but Buck wasn't someone who would give up without a heroic fight.  He's one of those quietly noble people who is so thoroughly human(in the best ways) that he should be a shinning example to our youth on how to live a good and fulfilled life.  And he gets to work with horses so I'm sure he's the happiest man on earth too.  Forget all those dysfunctional movie stars, rock stars, and sports figures and give your kids someone they can truly look up to.  Make them watch this movie and know what a real man looks like.",1425945600,,2189,4.320293398533007

4664112,5,B005E7SEMU,"This film is brilliant whether you know horses or not.  I knew nothing about them when I first saw this documentary other than they were stunning creatures to look at, and I found this film very informative and heartwarming.  After seeing this, I stumbled into the horse world, being given the opportunity to help care for a horse.  I'm now the primary one who works with her and have been to a Buck Brannaman clinic (sans horse) and plan to go to more.  The movie has a different feel if you are in the horse world, no matter what level you're at.  You notice a lot more about the horses and you begin to have a different kind of understanding of some of the things he says because you know what he means.  It is like a great book.  At different ages or levels of expertise you understand it differently, but at all ages or levels there is something for you and you love it.  I suppose the Buck Brannaman style of horsemanship isn't for everyone, but that's only if you don't want it to be.  He is quoted as saying, ""Horses are incredibly forgiving. They fill in places we're not capable of filling ourselves.""  He speaks for the horses.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.",1416700800,,1177,4.398148148148148

Buck Brannaman has not only proven the absurdity of tactics deriving from fear and intimidation, he has PROVEN unprecedented results from respect and love, together with what he calls ""operating on a feel"", which he demonstrates can take place ""even across the arena"", having horses that have been mistreated following him ""around the pen like a dog WITHIN MINUTES"",  as cited by a childhood friend.

This review does not even take into account Robert Redfords endorsements and pats-on-the-back, as I feel Mr. Redford has failed the most powerful psycho/social dynamics plaguing our communities by not using Mr. Redford's own connections to optimize the missed potential.",1409788800,,715,5.366071428571429

I was heartbroken for what he suffered as a child; I was in awe of those who stepped up to the plate to help the boys; and I am drawn to the confidence and old-fashioned decency of the mature Buck.

4664192,4,B005E7SEMU,"I've seen ""Buck""  as a documentary on tv.  Because my grandaugher loves horses and feelsl more secure around animals; I ordered this for her and she loved it.  I truly believe this DVD and documentary teaches children and adults alike how to be more patient and understanding with the animals and each other.  I've gotten her interested in horseback riding and she says she likes to talk to them.  Only wish I could afford the real thing for her, but;  we've placed various pieces of information out there where she could go pet and just hang around other persons horses.  Buck's life story is one to be watched.

4664197,5,B005E7SEMU,"The intertwining of Buck's life story and his current work with horses is well done.  The man himself is a gift to the horse world and those who work in it in any way.  I have had the privilege of riding in 6 or 7 clinics with Mark Rashid and it seems to me that they have the same compassionate, but emotionally uninvolved in drama (horse or human) approach.  They have both often stated the lack of a need for gimmicks.  I was impressed and enjoyed the movie and the man.",1402790400,,473,4.164835164835165
4664198,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is the story of the true horse whisperer. It tells the story of Buck Brannigan, who travels mostly in Montana and teaches others to break horses.

I must own that I'm terrified of horses, but I do understand, after watching this film, that there is something inherently amazing and simple all at once, about someone who has an insight to calming the terror in them towards us.

4664202,5,B005E7SEMU,"No doubt about it, this man truly gets horses and their intelligence. The bond he speaks of does really exist and is a magnificent gift in itself if you are lucky enough to experience it. The bond is a cross between your best friend; your most comfortable pair of shoes you look forward to each day; and a protectiveness that would rival your own mother. Yeah, and most people call them dumb animals- they're smarter and more honest than most people I know. Wonderful movie.",1401408000,,474,4.588235294117647
4664203,5,B005E7SEMU,Excellent film.  There are very few wisdom voices in our culture and often when you do find them they are in the unexpected places.  Buck is a wisdom voice for sure.,1401408000,,165,4.290322580645161

4664205,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is a gorgeous movie set around horses and how to work with them, but it's so much more than that. It is a look at how to deal with the people in your life too. You learn that kindness and earning respect will get you a lot more from a 1200 pound horse than trying to overpower them will, and of course, the same also works with people. A horse doesn't have to do what you ask them to, but he will if he wants to and if he likes you, he's much likely to do what you ask. People are a lot like that.
There is one very disturbing scene where an unruly stallion is brought to one of Buck's sessions. The horse has never been properly dealt with or cared for and is horribly misbehaved. It isn't his fault, but is sad to watch. In a way, it brings some reality to the horse part on the film.

4664211,5,B005E7SEMU,"Very inspiring movie. It makes me wonder what might have been if someone had taken me or my husband out of our homes when we were kids, and dealing with abusive parents.
My husband and I nodded through much of the movie. The things that Buck says reflect things we have both thought and said over the years.
I do wish that the movie did not perpetuate the notion that abused children are more likely to be abusive when we grow up. I know that there is maladjustment, but the statistics show that two thirds will not be abusive- similar to people that didn't have similar experiences.
But when he talks about how he watches his daughter's development and wonders if he could have thrived in a similar way- I really idententified with that. My husband and I can't afford to give our daughter squat. Hell, we can't even give her grandparents. But our house is rich in love and humor.
There is so much to love about this movie: Buck's clarity of thought, his message of patience, empathy, and kindness, and his message about personal responsibility.
The nurturing, the ability to thrive despite dark circumstances, and the amazing response from animals and people when they have someone's compassionate investment.... this is a great movie to own and share. It will stay with you, and you will be glad for it.",1399248000,,1305,4.653679653679654
4664212,1,B005E7SEMU,"I bought into the hype about this man and I saw the movie.

And I hated it.

Why?

It was about ""poor me"" and my rotten childhood and then he gets a chance to show his stuff, to show what a horse whisperer can do with that stallion with issues.
And he fails.

SPOILER ALERT.

He ropes the horse's hind foot so his assistant can ride the horse.
No prep work. No real training or horsemanship.
It's old school.

I take your ability to flee and you submit to my will.

The horse was never given any choices.

Then in another scene, Buck is in his trailer (mobile home trailer) and leaves his assistant to ""work"" with the stallion.

What's this assistant do? He riles up the stallion by sacking him out for saddling again. He advances and advances and advances on the stallion with the pad, the stallion is clearly agitated, clearly telling him to stop. But gets no relief.

Approach and retreat....that's what real horseman do.

But no retreat. There is flooding of the senses. You will submit.

But the stallion finally snaps and says NO with a bite to the face.

The assistant finally retreats and there is a bunch of crap spoken about, well can't save em all...and the stallion is put to death.

WTF???

I made the mistake of thinking, well, this might be for Hollywood's sake. Dramatic effect. So....

I went to a BB clinic recently and I was even more angry and disgusted at what I saw this man do to riders who came from all over and paid $700 to be there for the weekend.

This was his version of Colt Starting:
(more like colt traumatizing)

He'd put half a dozen loose horses (no riders at first, just saddled horses with halters and lear ropes on) in the round pen and move the horses around with a flag. Swatting at them, to make them move. Don't think waving the flag. Looked like a man swatting at flies that landed on the horses. Hand would raise and swat! fast.

They were clearly scared, but he would swat them to keep them moving in one direction and finally they would. Most of them.

One horse got out of the herd and went to the gate (clearly showing he was scared to be there and panicked), Buck rode up behind that horse and hit him as hard as he could. The horse was so startled he crashed into the gate with his head before bolting to catch up to the other horses.

Horse whisperer???

Then when the riders were called in to sit on their horses. They mounted up and Buck proceeds to swat at the horses to make them move together with the riders aboard.

The horses would bolt around together with the obviously scared riders aboard, holding on.
One woman was clearly VERY scared and her horse froze in place, in fear.

Buck came up behind them and he gave that horse a double swat on the rump.
The horse went into a short bucking fit (because there was not much room before the horse crashed into the other horses/riders)
The woman held on tight, almost coming off. But luckily she didn't. If she would have come off, it would have been in the path of the other riders.

This is compassion?
This is the horse whisperer?

Another group came in and they luckily were calmer than the previous group. They had more skill and so Buck left them alone. He didn't swat at them with his $75 flag.

 Then after them, there was one woman on a (luckily calm) horse.
The woman was too scared to ride her horse in the group.

These are UNBROKE horses remember....

Anyhow, she is on her horse and Buck is clearly agitated that she is scared. He puts his flag away and uses his roping skills instead.
He swats her horse in the face (on the nose) to make him turn when the woman can't get the horse to turn around and change directions.
Buck is even proud of his aim, by telling the crowd, 'look I aimed for his left nostril and right on target.'

He then proceeds to rope the horse's hind feet just for fun. He lets the rope fall off and to his credit he doesn't actually pull the rope to make it catch around and tighten, but he's ROPING the horse's feet WHILE this woman is riding and this is not a broke horse. Luckily, he was a very calm horse though.

4664219,5,B005E7SEMU,"Body, Mind and Soul. BUCK, IFC Films exceptional new documentary, will move you in more ways than you can even dream. A voyeuristic view into the life of Buck Brannaman, the real-life cowboy behind The Horse Whisperer book and movie, BUCK the movie runs the full gamut of emotions  from fun to funny to heart-warming to heart-wrenching.

The vistas and the animals are an eyeful and for the most part nicely  if not beautifully  photographed. Sometimes you can just smell the leather, taste the dust, feel the power of the horses.

And if the open road, ranches and animals aren't your thing, the intelligence of this quiet man is fascinating. You learn more about Buck the man by the way creatures respond to him (2 and 4 legged varieties) than you do by listening to him. He is typically, even stereotypically, the laid-back cowboy who only speaks when he really has something to say. And yet somehow this strong, reserved man leaves you with the impression that he wears his heart on his sleeve.

As The Duke once said, A mans got to have a code  a creed to live by. Brannaman tells you straight  Your horse is a mirror to your soul. Through his work with horses that are brought to him, the animals person cant help but see their own strengths and weaknesses reflected in the behavior patterns Buck is addressing. BUCK the film does an excellent job of intertwining these soul-searching moments with lighter motifs to create an entertaining, fascinating, educating work of art.

Incredibly, this is a first film for director Cindy Meehl. With a background in Fine Arts and fashion design, she formed her film company in 2008 and started making this film. That accounts for the simplistic approach to the film, but fortunately for her, not only can the subject matter stand up to her inexperience, the film is probably better for it. Stripped down and straightforward storytelling is refreshing, and since she didn't have any tricks up her sleeve she wasn't tempted to use them. With a no-nonsense subject like Buck Brannaman, slick film making would have been a disaster.

And as though this truly great film about a truly great man isn't enough reason to watch BUCK, the DVD release features not only good bonus features, but commentary with the filmmakers and Buck himself. This is only the second time in my years of reviewing that I have said this  watch the film a second time with the commentary. While there is the inevitable rambling to fill in the dead air, Brannaman has a lot more to say than the film has time to tell. And hes well-worth the listen.",1397433600,,2565,4.703125

Some of my favorite scenes are the ones with his wife and daughter.

Not all of this is easy to watch however--sometimes Mr. Brannaman is asked to clean up the mistakes of horse owners who are so colossally selfish and stupid and inhumane you wonder how anyone keeps their sanity after having to deal with people like that.

In this documentary, ""Buck,"" Robert Redford gives Buck Brannaman credit for inspiring what Mr. Redford does in the ""Horse Whisperer"" movie. What Mr. Redford should have done is say ""I cloned Buck Brannaman to create this role"" right down to the sliver bracelet, the tone of voice, and the slap of the lasso. When you watch ""Horse Whisperer,"" after watching ""Buck,"" it's as if Mr. Brannaman actually created the entire role (and Mr. Brannaman definitely does not get the credit he deserves in the credits that roll at the end of HW).

But it doesn't matter, because Mr. Brannaman doesn't do what he does for the glory.

Coming from the perspective of the horse and how it sees life, Buck shows people how to get the horse to be a fan of theirs, not an opponent that needs to be dominated.  Kindness, patience and love are all a part of this movie, and people learn how their own hang ups can be the problem.",1389484800,,355,4.057142857142857

4664276,5,B005E7SEMU,I rented this on Netflex a few years ago.  It had really good reviews.  I'm not around horses - nor do I live in the country - but I did enjoy this movie.  My daughter's father-in-law raises and trains horses though.  So I bought it as a gift for him.  He really enjoyed!  It surprised me - being more than a story about training horses - but also a look into the human heart.,1388620800,,376,4.013513513513513

4664292,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is a documentary about the cowboy who was the model for ""The Horse Whisperer.""I love this movie. Watched it on netflix first and realized I wanted to own it and share it with family members. Buck Brannaman's life story is inspiring and his humanity and authentic kindness make him really good at helping the horses AND the people he works with. This is the story of a person who became the man he wanted to be instead of the damaged person he seemed destined to become. As Robert Redford says in the movie, he is "" the real deal.""

4664296,4,B005E7SEMU,"I liked this DVD except for the fact that I had to endure the trailers for other movies right at the beginning.  The main menu did not come up until you waded through several trailers at the beginning of the DVD.  So I had to fast forward through that stuff to get to what I wanted to see.  Yuck.  Otherwise this was a good documentary.  Buck is an example of someone making lemonade out of a bunch of lemons.  Thank goodness he and his brother were rescued from their early childhood situation by people who saw what was going on and took it upon themselves to ACT, not shrug their shoulders and leave it to someone else to get involved.  I just wish the video went into more detail about the way he works with horses but I guess after all, the main thrust of the story is about Buck.  The video arrived well packaged and in reasonable time.  Just because really bad things happen to you in life does not mean you are doomed to a miserable life.  Buck is an example of that.",1386547200,,975,4.221621621621622

4664301,3,B005E7SEMU,"As a horse owner who had already watched Buck's instructional DVD's on horse training and attended clinics with other ""natural"" trainers like Mark Rashid and watching Pat Parelli's videos, I learned very little new about horses in this video. I was hoping it was more of the story of Buck's life and his experiences training horses, but it really is a documentary about his current practices and how he teaches other horse owners to understand their horses better. They throw in a bit about how Buck's father abused him when he was young, but don't connect the dots to how that affected his horse training.

If you have little or no experience with horses, I would highly recommend this movie. My non-horse-owning relatives liked it a lot. It is a real eye-opener relating to both human and horse psychology.",1386201600,2,808,4.81294964028777

I have also bought it as a gift for other people that I'm sure will treasure it as much as I do.

  Buck and his family and almost all the people mentionned in the film are inspiring in one way or another.  I love Buck's adoptive mother (and father, although I'm guessing that he is now ,unfortunately,deceased).  In that case, I wish that there were at least a DVD about his mother's life.  When I see and hear her in this film, I feel as if she has blessed me without even knowing that I exist!

I think this does a great job of looking at how a person does not have to follow in his parents footsteps and he can overcome a poor childhood.  I think the way he relates to horses is more of how I relate to them.  The movie, which my class watches, is a great discussion movie and I liked that they have a horse that is not salvageable... mainly due to human error.

Buck, the horse trainer, grew up under horrific circumstances, yet overcame them through his love of horses.  The training he does, especially the ""horse/foal starting,"" is gentle, understanding of the horse's personalities, and perhaps more importantly, the personality of the owners.  A story of triumph, it is a documentary full of life lessons.",1381622400,,449,5.295774647887324

I would think any horsey person would like to watch this, but you would be surprised the non horsey people who have watched this with me and got a lot out of it too. An amazing person and his living story.",1381276800,,344,4.0
4664346,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck Brannaman is one of the smartest trainers I have seen. He teaches you the patience with horses and ways to get them to get them to do what you want and need them to do and makes it looks so easy. He also tells you what NOT to do with a horse that has lost its Mother and end up losing the horse because you raised it in your home as a child. One horse had a serious problem and had to be put down. He helped do the movie"" The Horse Whisperer"" also using his own horse to do a trick for the girl who owned him and lost half her leg during the accident they had at the beginning of the movie, and that was making him lie down on his side and her mounting him then him getting up with her on his back so she could ride again. Wonderful job! I cry every time I see that movie but it turned out good...horses are beautiful creatures that can give love back as much as you can give love to him/her! You can truly bond with them if they feel that love! I know, I had one once...leaves forever memories in your heart and soul !",1381190400,,1024,3.880952380952381

4664350,5,B005E7SEMU,From a trouble childhood to being one of the most beloved horseman.. Buck is an amazing movie to watch... you won't just learn about buck or horses..youll go even further and learn something about yourself. A great movie to watch with the whole family.,1380672000,,252,4.75

4664352,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck is the buddah of horse trainers. He is a man of few words but what he says matters. The personal story of Buck's difficult childhood and family are interwoven with scenes of his training seminars and competitions. This is a move that appeals to horse lovers and others equally. My goddaughter said at the start, ""I don;t like documentaries."" When it was over she declared how much she liked it...pretty good for a wise 19 year old! You watch this one over and over - terrific flick! Thanks Buck!!!",1380240000,,502,4.588888888888889
4664353,5,B005E7SEMU,I felt that the movie about Buck was an honest appraisal of his life's work.  It definitely should appeal to horse owners but it has something to say about life in general.,1380240000,,172,4.375
4664354,5,B005E7SEMU,"Exceptional Movie.
Went to a screening of the movie ""Buck"" last night with Q&A after with the producer Cindy Meehl.  Very interesting one of the more insightful things she talked about was the woman with the very aggressive stallion towards the end of the movie.  Buck put the blame for the condition of the horse, even with possible brain damage when it was born with the way it was raised by the woman.  Cindy gave her credit for going back to other Buck Brannaman clinics even though she has taken a lot of heat from the way that horse turned out.  It was not only about horses but the human condition as well.  ""Your horse is a mirror to your soul.  Sometimes you might not like what you see..."" -Buck Brannaman-.  Caren I really expected to see you in the movie next to Buck.  I actually caught myself looking for you a few times.",1380067200,,835,4.376623376623376

4664358,5,B005E7SEMU,"I had no idea what was coming when I started watching this film.  After being totally blown away by this story I convinced my wife, who was in no mood for a horse documentary, to see it.  Not even 10 minutes in she was transfixed.

As David Letterman said about this film,  ""If you don't like this film there is something seriously wrong with you.""",1379462400,,348,4.3076923076923075

4664364,5,B005E7SEMU,"I am not a horse person, but I found this documentary fascinating and I loved it! I also purchased a copy for my mom who owns/rides a horse. Be warned, the story of his earlier life is sad, but it's such a beautiful story how he made something good out of his experience. After seeing this and The Horse Whisperer, with Robert Redford, I could really see how Robert Redford became this guy for the movie.",1378425600,,404,4.328947368421052

4664368,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck was the character model for Robert Redford's ""The Horse Whisperer"" and technical adviser during filming. He may well be the most famous and influential horse trainer in the world at this time. That alone might make this DVD worth owning. But the true value of this lies elsewhere.

I thought this documentary would be mostly about horses or at least about training horses. This man has a gift for seeing into the souls of people and the hearts of horses. I'm not really a horse person but I am in love with a woman who is and has been ever since she was a little kid. To celebrate our 24th Anniversary, we went to Elkhorn, Nebraska, last weekend to a Buck Branaman Clinic.

He is the real deal and absolutely the same person in person as he is presented in this documentary. When I commented on that during a lunch break to another middle-aged man who is from South Dakota, he replied, ""I don't believe there's a false bone in his body.""

Whether you care even slightly about riding, training horses or cowboys in general, do yourself a favor and watch this documentary. It is a powerful, touching story of developing gifts, perseverance and the incredible power of a gentle touch. There aren't five people in the world who've ever made me want to be a better person. Buck Branaman does.",1378252800,,1292,4.560344827586207

4664375,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is a truly wonderful documentary for anyone who is interested in animals, especially horses.  ""Buck"" captures the real essence of horsemanship in the purest sense of the word. I felt like I could relate to Buck the man on many levels not only as a horsewoman but as a person who had a similar history.  I only wish it were longer- don't get me wrong.. it's a full length documentary but I wish it was even longer. Could have watched it all day.",1376697600,,449,4.333333333333333

4664378,5,B005E7SEMU,"I must have watched BUCK a dozen times during the rental period. Paused it in places to see the little things that really matter. Then I bought the book!  Really do get both.  As a newer horse Owner I gained plenty of insight or more validation in what I was doing.  I live in Santa Ynez, CA where we still have lots of real cowboys and gals and let me tell you no matter what their level the pros will always recommend Buck, Ray Hunt and all these true horse whisper folks whether they take the title or not they truly have it figured out.  Whether you are a horse person or not you will connect to the story especially the book.  It's incredibly interesting when you think about it all and you will come out really getting a bit more out of life. No pun intended there. Gorgeous filming especially on the intro.  Buck is here in Santa Ynez this October 2013 for Vaqueros Roping and I can't wait to see him out there with all his buddies in the area. A real treat and a highlight.  Redford and other interviews are great to watch.  Watch Buck and then the Horse Whisperer on Amazon for an amazing night of great entertainment.",1375315200,,1127,4.283018867924528

So, of course, when I saw it for sale, I wanted to own it.  Having grown up around Idaho, and raised on the local television of the 50's and 60's, I was drawn to the history of Buck's childhood adventures.  I laughed, I cried, I contemplated.  I have so been inspired by this story, that I have given it to loved ones as gifts.  Watch it!---it's irresistible!",1375228800,,495,4.326086956521739

4664386,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is a very useful thing to put together especially with the book, ""Believe,"" by Mr. Brannaman. It shows problems he has had and how he runs his clinics. It also shows that many riders who have horse with problems are riders who have problems themselves. If you are not ready for that, then you will like the movies and have a problem with the book, I think. You may need to commit yourself to the fact that left to his own devices your horse would do well in a herd of horses in the ""wild."" However in the abnormal situation it finds itself in, you or someone the horse has encountered before, may be the root of any problems. The really wonderful thing is Mr. Brannaman can solve everything anyone throws his way; but you have to be ready and amenable to ""change.""",1374105600,,769,4.347222222222222

I'm not a horseman, but this documentary is more than just about training horses. It correlates training horses to training for life. Buck's background and upbringing really is a miracle. Raised by an abusive father he could have easily continued the cycle. Instead he was rescued by two loving foster parents who took the time and molded him into the man he is today. Unfortunately there are a lot of kids growing up in abusive homes. I think this documentary is very relevant and has a wide appeal, not just to people who own horses.
A worthy rental or purchase in my opinion.",1374105600,,742,4.537313432835821

I actually watched it in entirety TWICE in a row the first time I watched it, and will be watching it several more times. Very enlightening to see a horseman NOT use coersion as his main tool for training. I can only compare it to another gem in the field of horse training, Shawna Karrasch (ontargettraining.com) I highly recommend it! Caledon, Ontario",1373932800,,418,4.739726027397261

He demonstrates his horse whispering techniques that  are superior to harsher methods and explains that at the heart of it is mutual respect. Buck's incredible understanding and empathy spring from his own life experiences. His philosophy carries over to the way people ought to treat one another which is what makes this film so outstanding. It is amazing to see how cooperative the horses are to his firm yet gentle guidance. For one of the side steps, Buck places his hand near the head of the horse without touching the animal, and the horse follows his gesture. It is very inspiring.",1371945600,,880,4.827814569536423

4664416,5,B005E7SEMU,"Great movie, a very good insight into training horses. They are sensitive animals and do respond to kindness and Buck is very good at pointing that out. He also is far more cautions about mounting a horse until it has calmed down and can trust you. People that are around horses have learned a lot because of Buck's manner of dealing with them.  Good story line as well,his abused childhood was the foundation of a wonderful outcome..",1369180800,,434,4.636363636363637

4664423,5,B005E7SEMU,"""The Horse Whisperer"" is one of my favorite movies. Buck Brannaman, the subject of this documentary, was an advisor to Robert Redford and also his riding double. Although ""The Horse Whisperer"" does exhibit some misconceptions about the actual methods of the compassionate training of horses, the documentary shows how best results are achieved in real life situations.  ""Buck"" is a very inspiring movie, about overcoming physical abuse and becoming a skilled horse trainer, whose kindness, sincerity, humor and compassion about humans and their horses shine through.",1368144000,,566,5.5813953488372094
4664424,5,B005E7SEMU,"I worked in our local library for a couple of years and while processing DVDs that were being returned by patrons I learned to look at the cover closely.  I started noticing a DVD called ""Buck"" coming through more and more frequently, so I took a chance and checked it out myself.  I was blown away by this film and watched several times over a couple of months.

I won't summarize the film -- I'm sure others have already done so -- but I'll give you a trick I learned at the library.  When choosing independent films you may not have heard of, look for ones that have won the Audience Favorite Award at any given film festival.  ""Buck"" was one of those winners, and I've found others that was as well.  They're almost universally the best movies out there and often far better than the grand prize winners at the festivals and Oscars.",1368057600,,836,4.396103896103896
4664425,4,B005E7SEMU,Loved this DVD.  It is a must see even if you are not a horse lover.  Good lessons about overcoming adversity.  And about how we as people can learn how to communicate better.,1368057600,,175,4.242424242424242
4664426,4,B005E7SEMU,"While I am not a big fan of Buck Brannaman I believe that every one who is around horses or plans to be should see the sequence with that spoiled Palomino Stallion.  I was a little surprised to see it on DVD.

I grew up handling horses that would try to kill you.  Not many are around today, but there are some.  Every horse handler should be aware that a horse can kill you in a heartbeat.

I am sick of whiners who claim that they were abused as children.  Those of us that grew up during the 1930's really appreciate what we have today.  I wonder, sometimes, if Buck does?",1367884800,2,575,4.126126126126126

4664433,5,B005E7SEMU,"Watched this thinking how I've missed my chance to follow my westward dream of owning a ranch/farm. That should tip off anyone reading this that I will be a bit bias. I felt Buck brought his passions to life, remarkable for such a quiet spoken man. Other reviewers mention how this film offers something for everyone, horse minded or not, and I agree. Seeing my east coast husband and teenagers watching it through and actually enjoying it spoke volumes to me. Not if I could only get them to move west...",1365724800,,505,4.56043956043956

4664437,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck says the single most powerful thing I have ever heard in this movie: we can all make choices. Choices about how we act and react not only affect ourselves, but all those around us. Horses are a mirror to ourselves, and we do not always like what we see in that mirror. What Buck has overcome, and what he helps horses overcome, is a testament to the resilience of both human and animal spirits. This movie is a must see - for horse people and for those who have never touched a horse.

I have to save some money and find a way to get to one of his clinics. I'm feeling the need for some horse psychiatry and a long look in that mirror.",1365292800,,640,4.079365079365079

I will say that unless you have a deep-seated love for horses, this probably is not the movie for you. I know that it would have bored a lot of my friends to tears.

Get the 7 Clinics with Buck Brannaman: Complete Set 1-7 or his ""Making of a Bridle Horse"" series which are fabulous for how-to training.

I am aware of Buck's methods and have ridden on a horse that had the Buck method of training. The video showed the McGinnis Meadow Cattle Ranch near Libby, Montana, where I had my first experience horse-back riding in 2005 when I was in my mid-fifties. If you want to experience horses using his training, McGinnis is the place to go. After a bit of instruction, I was riding my first horse with confidence. We rode through cattle, moved cattle, rode up and down steep hills and the horses behaved so well. The video has instilled in me that a problem horse is most likely the result of something the rider is or is not doing.

4664547,4,B005E7SEMU,"I want to start off by saying I know very little about training horses.  Any and all experience I've had on a horse were with already trained horses that were gentle and people friendly.  That being said I really liked Bucks attitude about being gentle with a horse to train it.

I found one example on point: Buck had a gentleman hold a rope.  Buck pointed out that he liked to maintain a gentle pressure on the rope when training a horse and demonstrated with the man holding the rope the proper technique in how you reached the desired point was very important!  Buck gently applied pressure on the rope in one instance to reach the point he liked.  In another instance he yanked the rope to get to the pressure point.  In both instances he maintained the same pressure but Buck pointed out that the man flinched every time prior to Buck pulling the rope after he had yanked it because he anticipated the jerk even when there wasn't one! Made perfect sense!

Bucks point was that one should be gentle EVERY time.  It really hit home!

There were a few questionable moments for me though as well such as roping the horses leg.  Is that really necessary and couldn't it end up injuring the horse?  Yes it got the man on the back of horse fast.. but it didn't feel totally right.

The main issue I have concerned the horse whose owner eventually stated she would put the horse down.  I would have (like other reviewers of this have stated) liked to hear Buck state that his 4 day clinic was NOT the avenue for this horse and recommend to the owner that she needed to obtain a trainer who could fully focus on her horse for an extended period.  AFTER she had the horse fixed so that he wasn't a stud anymore. Instead, Buck took the `this horse has brain damage' avenue that I found to be reprehensible.  I did not feel this horse was given the proper chance but that the horses owner took this example and ran with it.

It was obvious this woman had no clue how to handle horses and most likely did not want to invest in long term training.. a pity this horse ended up with her as an owner and that the end of the road was Bucks clinic.

I'm of the opinion that Bucks clinics are geared more towards individuals who have minor issues with their horses or who have NO issues but might want to learn a little more (such as learning how to cattle herd.)

Overall I found this interesting and I did like the base `message' behind this: horses should be treated gently and with respect.  It was also good to see how dangerous a horse CAN be and how fast they can be!  Just because they are big does not mean they are slow!

I would recommend this to others for viewing but I would caution this is not to be taken as 100% be all examples on how to. I rate it 4 star for Bucks overall intentions and message of being gentle even if he or his counterparts don't always demonstrate or practice what they preach.

I don't think Buck has any ill intentions toward horses or anyone else.  He seems like a good hearted guy.  And I like the fact this demonstrates just because you have been abused does not mean you will be an abuser.  This movie sets a great example for those who were once in Bucks position as a child with an abusive father.  Hats off to Buck for becoming a great man even after enduring such horrible circumstance!",1355184000,,3320,4.312903225806451

4664569,5,B005E7SEMU,"I love this documentary.  Buck Brannaman doesn't need the glitz and glamour to get the job done.  He is quiet spoken and the proof is in his actions.  The difference between him and others who are out to profit big in this industry, is that he not only changes the lives of the horses he works with, he changes the lives of their owners.  I learned so much about working with horses, but I learned more about myself and that has helped leaps and bounds with my relationship with my young horse.",1351555200,2,494,4.336956521739131

We're not into horses but I know someone who is, so I recommended it to her and she said she'd been dying to see the movie.  She then got it as a birthday gift.

She has her own horse and would like to start training horses as a job, so this was perfect for her.  A friend of hers goes to all of Bucks classes when he comes to town.

4664578,5,B005E7SEMU,"I am Dennis, Sandy's husband. It was on a Saturday morning and I decided to just kick back, turn on the TV and relax. Buck had just started and I was all ready to change the channel. I am a city boy at the age of 70 with a deep love for the country and horses. I have dreamed of horses and their charming ways ever since I was a little baby boy. I didn't know anything about Buck and it looked as if the movie was designed for folks with a stable of show and working horses. So even though I do love horses, I didn't think it was my kind of horse movie. How fortunate that I am slow on the draw. With the remote control in my hand and the buttons pressed against my fingers, I kept resisting the urge to change the channel. After a few minutes here and there I laid the remote down to rest and had tears in my eyes. All I can say is that, it (the movie) is my kind of stuff. I moved out to the country from the city about 20 years ago to take a job. I just could not go through my life without living away from the city. And because I have moved to a small Village in the country I now know many very good and decent folks that work with horses in one way or another. Today I bought 6 Buck DVD's. And these DVD's are going to some of the ranchers that have not seen the movie (I asked them if they had ever seen it). I am having Amazon send the movie to them as a gift. And believe me I am as excited about that as they will be when they get their gift and view it. So, take that, American public and you can do the same.",1348876800,,1521,3.8012618296529967

4664581,5,B005E7SEMU,The Movie Buck is the best I have seen for learning how to train a horse.

The story includes brief accounts of Buck's relationship with his foster parents, people obviously fostering children because they love them, not because there's money in it.

The movie goes into, but doesn't dwell on Buck's traumatic childhood, and shows us we can choose how we react to our past:  we can repeat it or not.  Buck earns an animal's respect, by understanding it, and guides horses thru gentle persuasion instead of intimidation.  If everyone treated the world with the same respect Buck treats his world, we'd live in a much better place.  I bought the movie from Amazon, so I could watch it whenever I wanted to be reminded how a gentle man overcame his own past to help others do the same.

4664600,5,B005E7SEMU,"I'm not a horse enthusiast, but I am an avid student of human psychology and behavior, and I can tell that Buck Brannaman is a master. Buck was amazing to watch -- he can get a horse to behave in about 20 minutes, and to respond to signals so subtle, you can hardly tell he was doing anything. He understands that a horse's behavior, good or bad, is the direct result of the owner's treatment, so he counsels the human beings while he's training their horses. And his style is so down-to-earth and matter-of-fact that they can't help but listen.

I'm utterly inspired by how peaceful he is in his approach toward horses as well as other people. He deeply understands that anger and criticism instills fear rather than discipline, and he applies this understanding in his calm approach to even the most difficult horse (and owner). This is a guy who was terribly abused by his father, who turned around and used his sensitivity in his work.",1340236800,2,939,4.589285714285714

In addition I got to see and hear him instructing in the movie and mentoring to the owners of their horses.  The movie gave me a visual look at Buck's life.  I would like to attend one of his clinics just to see and hear him work.  You don't need a horse to learn from him as his lessons in training, communication and compassion transfer to everyday life.  The scenes Cindy Meehl chose to bring the story to life do indeed enhance everything I have ever read or heard about Buck Brannaman.

Buck Brannaman is unique, part horse trainer, part therapist to the people who come to him for help with their horses.  He shares so much in this movie about his own struggles to overcome childhood abuse, but he didn't just overcome it, he has managed to become an incredible person who deliberately chose to walk a very different path and chose not to carry on the legacy of the abuse he suffered.  Rather he has transformed the lessons of his past into a patient, compassionate and gentle approach with both the horses he trains, and the people in his life.

This is a wonderful and potentially life changing movie with lessons for horsemen, but also for anyone who can accept and learn from his message on how to live a gentler - more compassionate life.",1332115200,,868,4.544871794871795

And like a marriage, its not all roses and candy.  There are a few reallities that have to be faced that don't always go smoothly. Along with others that just don't work, and will never work.

But when I see something so likable and legitimate, then I'll have to throw in with the crowds my support and appreciation for this picture and it's central character. While Buck is pretty simple in it's structure and story, what it is about is paradoxically very deep and very sublime. In short, this guy represents the best side of humanity's ability to connect and understand the animals we live with and use. He travels constantly, 40 weeks a year running a 4 day clinic breaking down poor habits and informing horse owners and lovers of a deeper, more peaceful and real way to connect with these beautiful and sublime animals. And his techniques and style are impressive in their essential humanity. The real life association as the Horse Whisperer is right on, but perhaps The Way of the Peaceful Horseman makes sense too. Countered with his horse clinic life is his past, violent childhood, full of abuse, that speaks to his understanding and calming nature around horses, such sensitive beings, that commonly suffer under the whip and harness. Highly recommended, certainly for children and definitely for horse lovers.

Buck is an interesting man with unique skills, and the movie tells his story well. But Buck hasn't changed my life or made me into one of his groupies, and I feel that he does several questionable things in this film.  As impressive as his techniques are, I think much of what Buck does with the horses would get ordinary people killed. Buck's emphasis on speed with his extreme horse makeovers make them seem more like carnival stunts than actual horse training. (SPOILERS AHEAD!) The movie almost had me sold on Buck as a genius right up until that horrific biting scene. That poor man was dealing with a horse that was known to be a dangerous stud, mentally unstable, and a biter, but the man proceeded without any safety precautions right before Buck's eyes. How about a muzzle next time or some kind of face guard or body armor?  Honestly, what was the point of that unfortunate man taking such an extreme risk? In my opinion, Buck was complicit and contributed to that man getting mutilated for life. Maybe Buck was right about the owner having personal problems that reflected her horses' problems? Or you could also say he was browbeating an insecure and guilt-ridden woman who was still upset about her friend getting bitten. But in any event, how is Buck not responsible for that tragic biting? Buck was supervising the training and it happened on his watch. Bravo to the filmmaker for including that scene! It took what could have been a feel-good horse documentary and made it into something complex and difficult.

4664667,5,B005E7SEMU,"I expected to like ""Buck,"" Cindy Meehl's documentary about the famous horse whisperer Buck Brannaman, but I did not expect to be so moved by it. The trailer was amazing, with its scenes of horses following Brannaman around the ring, unbridled, like well-trained dogs. Those scenes are just as amazing in the full movie, but their impact is increased exponentially by seeing Buck as he really is, and learning of the horrific abuse he survived as a child. That abuse, the movie tells us, gave Buck an early and unique understanding into the psychology of horses, and also a unique understanding of how cruelty--in the handling of either horses or people--creates only resentment and distrust.

Buck spends nine months of the year crisscrossing the country, from North Carolina to California, leading horse-training sessions. Meehl followed him on his travels, recording his interactions with horses and people, incidentally showing us some of the most magnificent country you will ever see. Buck shares some of his travels with his daughter Riata, who clearly inherited her father's passion and empathy for horses. For fans of ""The Horse Whisperer,"" don't worry, Nicholas Evans and Robert Redford show up too. Buck of course was a technical adviser on the film, and he solved problems during the production that baffled all of Hollywood's most experienced horse wranglers.

In almost every case, Buck makes a big difference for the better in the lives of both horses and their owners. The movie, however, does show us one tragic failure. Some horses, like some people, just can't be reached.

""Buck"" succeeds as a character study, a modern Western, a celebration of horses and an inspirational film. Above all, it is the story of a genuinely good man who overcame terrible hardships to attain awe-inspiriting levels of courage, kindness and wisdom. It sounds corny to say, but ""Buck""--both the man and the movie--made me feel better about the world and reaffirmed my pride in being an American.",1326585600,,1993,5.08868501529052
4664668,5,B005E7SEMU,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started watching this movie.  Perhaps I thought it would be about how Buck Brannaman, the 'horse whisperer' worked with problem horses.  Well it was that and so much more.  In fact, while horses dominate virtually every scene, it is Buck and his life that drive an artfully presented story.  Buck overcomes a horrendous childhood, lack of trust and shyness to share his amazing abilities to heal horses and ultimately, people.  Shot mostly on locations in the western states, you become part of those beautiful landscapes and grow to love those who love horses.  What really pulls this movie together are the movies and photos from Buck's well documented childhood as a famous child rodeo star.  Buck's past and present mesh seamlessly into understanding of a 'tortured soul'.

This movie is brutal in showing the reality of horse training past and triumphant in contrasting Buck's methods.  Buck says that horses are mirrors of their owner's souls.  You will understand in a very real way what that means as Buck takes on one of his biggest challenges in a dangerous three year old colt.

As an animal lover, I found this movie to be very moving.  As a person trying to understand the motivations of my fellow humans, this movie gave me great insight into that as well.

When I started teaching these wonderful people thru horse therapy, I saw them transform before my very eyes.  Horses can transform a person who is disturbed into an individual who craves knowledge....especially of horses.  There is one story of an older black man who would not get near the horses because he had been thrown by one when he was little and was afraid.  Within a few hours, I had him in the arena, picking up the horse's feet and teaching him how to clean them.  It was the most rewarding moment of my life....ever.

4664680,5,B005E7SEMU,"A neighbor told me abou this documentary because I trained horses as a young person.  He thought I would enjoy it.  Boy did I!  I was amazed that Buck trained horses in the same manner I did and with the same results!  His story is not sad as one might think it would be as he was abused as a child.  He literally CHOSE to pull himself up by the bootstraps and make something good out of his life. I have always seen life that way.  We have many choices and blaming our parents or significant people in our lives is not the answer.  We can choose to be what we want to be.  Buck's kindness to people and horses is absolutely heart-warming and encouraging. I chose a long time ago to become a Christian - not just in name - but in practice.  There were so many paths I could have taken but choosing to apply Christian principles in my life made the difference for my family and my sons and their families.  That said, I don't know what Buck's religious beliefs are but I do know he chose Christian principles to guide his life.  I recommend this to parents, difficult and misunderstood young people, and, well, to everyone!",1325721600,,1122,4.295238095238095

The man who trains horses like nobody else was the victim of child abuse for many years, but Buck endured, and testimonials to his gentle teaching methods -- including high praise from Redford himself -- help to make Buck, an inspiring documentary.",1325116800,4,588,5.26595744680851

But aside from the message that ""breaking"" horses by breaking their will is cruel and unnecessary, there is a message that every viewer can relate to.  Each person is responsible for becoming an honorable, caring and fair human no matter how her or his life started.  Buck refused to become a man like his father - a man of anger, intolerance and cruelty. In the film he seems to be a happy man, travelling the country 9 months a year to teach people to handle their horses gently, and WELL.  Great message.",1324857600,,598,4.5607476635514015

It is Christmas morning here and we have not heard from her yet, but I know that she will cherish this story.

4664695,5,B005E7SEMU,"Buck The Movie was phenomenal. Not just because of the content - horses, people who love horses, etc...  This film was inspirational on many levels. Buck's story alone is intriguing in itself, how he managed to overcome his past and celebrate the present is what makes a human being keep moving forward and reach for possibilities denied.

Karma is so evident in Buck's life. Conscientiously he knows that he himself is his own redeemer and makes it a point to live his life accordingly. Indeed this is a story of human nature and how regardless of what we've endured, choosing to not let the pain rule our lives, but instead to celebrate accomplishements and reach out to others by example, deeds and courage.

 How we operate within our lives and realize the effect we have to those around us wether they are human or horses is very clear, all we need do is act upon the goodness within us, and we too can succeed.",1324425600,,916,4.567073170731708

I am leery of a lot of the natural horsemanship ""experts"" out there, but I had seen snippets of Buck Brannaman working with the people who own problem horses and liked his approach--that it's actually the people with the problems. This DVD gives the viewer a lot to think about, and it's entertaining as well.",1324425600,,410,4.554054054054054
4664697,5,B005E7SEMU,"I'd first like to address the cowboy reviewer that was so upset over an incident in the movie: a stud that was to be put down. Son, that owner was a catastrophe. She has a lot of work to do just to get her own life together. Unfortunately, her horses are caught up in the middle of the storm.  This horse would require an unbelievable amount of hours with just the right trainer. In the meantime, no matter what precautions were taken (and even if no one got killed) someone was going to get hurt. Maybe very badly. Did the woman ultimately put the horse down? I don't know. Maybe she had a change of heart, gelded him, and put him somewhere he couldn't hurt anyone. I don't know. But Buck is just one man. He can't fix the whole world. With thousands of horses to be helped, there's no way to devote your life to just one, unless it's your own horse and you choose to spend your life that way.

That case was an example to all people of what happens when you don't step up and do your job, whether it's with horses, or dogs, or -- most importantly -- kids. Once the damage has been done, it's going to take a hundred times more work to undo it. Lots of people are sitting in prison because their parents did so much damage it couldn't be undone. And some of them even end up being ""put down.""

AS FOR THE MOVIE: This is an introduction to an exceptional human being; what he does; how he does it.  If you are looking for an exciting, riveting movie, this is not for you. It's simply the story of Buck Brannaman. I loved the movie.  He overcame what could have destroyed him and he used that knowledge to change the paths of thousands of lives (people and horses).

If you are intrigued by people, if you have a passion for horses, watch ""Buck,"" otherwise simply move on, Cowboy.",1324339200,2,1779,4.2485207100591715
4664698,1,B005E7SEMU,"Albeit Buck, the man, deserves gratifying applause for his amazing personal strength, Buck, the movie, doesn't.  As a matter of fact, except for the occassional mishap of man vs. horse here and there, it was far too long and sank into boredom.  ""Buck"", touted as a powerful story of how man is mirrored in the behavior of ""our"" horses and what we can learn about ourselves from these animals... is a philosophy that never gelled.  Professing that how these animals react to their environments is based solely on how they are treated by their ""owners"" is blatant arrogance.  People like myself who view owning animals for entertainment as cruel no matter how much hay and new shoes ""their"" horses get... bristle at such grandiose grandstanding as making a movie out of it.  Man has no rights to any animal that doesn't want to be part of our processes and these horses depicted this in no uncertain terms.  Good for them!  Of COURSE horses and pets and children will reflect how they are raised!  Of COURSE a horse will finally ""break"" (give in) to man out of sheer exhaustion... and do you know why?  BECAUSE IT HAS NO OTHER CHOICE!  And what did they do to the horse that bit the man?  One second later, the ownder said, ""I'm GONNA HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN!""  THE HORSE WASN'T BORN TO BE RIDDEN BY YOUR ARROGANT BEHIND!  To kill it is assaulting!  I was so sickened by this whole process!  No matter how nice or how repetetively ""kind"" we sugar-coat our actions towards horses, we have NO RIGHT to declare ""winning"" any battles with them as this movie boasts throughout.  From ropes to man-made competitions to movies, no horse EVER chose to be a part of any of this.  I am happy that Buck survived his cruel master's faults.  But that's only because he was able to break away.  Horses don't have that option.  Their life is doomed to nothing more than slavery.  And for what?  For man's selfish, even hateful entertainment needs.  Just because the horse isn't speaking his mind and isn't kicking or biting someone DOESN'T mean it is correct or just that horses be kept in a trailer to play out their ""master's"" bidding for the rest of their caged life.  This movie didn't raise any emotional levels except anger and sadness.  These gorgeous, ancient animals, like so many others, are doomed to become property of we devils that destroy more of this planet than any other creature here.  ""Horse people"" need to be seen for what they are.  They may provide basic life essentails to the animal, but when it comes to this kind of takeover of a species; gambling, rodeos, ""work/plow horses"", riding them for our pleasure, etc, it is just plain shameful.  And showing no care of slaughtering an animal simply because it resists our hands and our cages, well, simply put, THE BUCK STOPS HERE.",1324339200,10,2782,4.622448979591836

When I saw this film, I thought ""at least someone had the good sense to share the experience in a much more scalable way"", but most importantly it was put together in a way that would even engage and intrigue the non-horse person.
It's beautifully shot and the moral to the story, a true one at that, is that we can all change our path going forward, from whatever past we have evolved from and make every life that much better when we cross paths with the right intentions.

Coming from an ag community and background I know that a lot of people will have you believe working with horses and cattle and any sort of livestock is a cruel and heartless business, but this film and the way Buck works with horses is a perfect example of how humane it can be if you have the desire to do what's best for the animals and the people you work with everyday.",1322870400,,733,4.375

Buck shows how to make the needed close connection with a horse through some unique training with some amazing results.  This is NOT a action filled western, nor is it purported to be.  Instead it quietly shows what a man who deeply loves, respects, & understands horses, can accomplish...and shares that knowledge with others & so enriches the lives of horses and their owners everywhere.

I've never had a horse (wish I did) but I love them & for me, this video viewing was time so well spent. I'd highly recommend it to others animal lovers.",1322179200,,1241,4.6

Actually, I became a lot more interested in horses after seeing this movie.  Owning a copy allows me to share it with my family and friends who might not have seen it in the theatres.  I also think it is a great story for kids (well, maybe not the youngest)to see how you can overcome adversity and do what you choose with your life.",1321920000,,643,4.079365079365079

The beatings came to encourage them to learn their rope tricks better and for less understandable reasons.  Buck has overcome the challenges in his childhood and has become, in this documentary, a man with a simple truth; that if we are patient and sympathetic, we can get both horses and people to listen and understand.

It is a wonderful account of the two sides of Buck Brannaman - the recovering victim of a violent abusive childhood, and the gentle man who can charm most horses into almost anything.  His doting relationship with his daughter shows the extent to which he has determined not to let the abuse he suffered, carry on generationally to his own children.  Among the standout scenes in the movie are one of a horse putting itself voluntarily into a float while Buck stands nonchalantly at the other end of a slack rope.  Also a dazzling display of trick roping - one of his specialities.  Those who genuinely love horses will love this movie.",1321401600,4,702,4.637096774193548

However, in watching and listening to Buck's childhood story, it dawned on me that he came from the same place my Dad had been.  My daddy  (Shorty) had been abused by his father as a child.  When my grandfather came home in a drunken stupor one night, and proceeded to beat my Dad's baby brother, it was too much for Shorty.  My Dad picked up a piece of firewood and knocked his dad out.

4664754,5,B005E7SEMU,"As a horseperson, I have known who Buck Brannaman is and seen him at clinics for a number of years, but I really never knew the story behind the man who has been called the Horse Whisperer.  We saw this movie when it came out and I knew I wanted to own the DVD.

""Buck"" is about a child, a man, and horses.  And it is such a feel good story because it could have had a much different outcome.  Sadly, his understanding of and success with horses has its roots in the abuse and tumultuous life he suffered as a child at the hands of his alcoholic father. But out of the rough comes a diamond!

This bio-documentary follows horse clinician Buck Brannaman to clinics on the road and his encounters with many horses and their owners, in his efforts to bring understanding and harmony between the two.  That, interspersed with interviews with friends and family, actor/director Robert Redford, with whom he worked as an advisor on the movie, The Horse Whisperer, and his relationship with the late Ray Hunt, give us the story of this remarkable horseman.  He says our horses are a reflection of us and through examining our relationship with them we can learn a lot about ourselves.  For Brannaman, his relationship with horses comes from his childhood.

Viewers will be saddened by the heart-breaking abuse he and his brother suffered as children.  But gladened by the efforts of a coach, a sheriff, and a loving foster family to change the lives of these two boys. Brannaman's candidness about his feelings toward his father, the abject fear and hopelessness he felt as a child when hs mother died, his foster parents, and his thoughts about his own family give us insight into the world of abused children and hope for them. It's a wonderful story of a boy who got a second chance at life, who has become a loving husband and father, and is making a difference in the lives of horses and their people.

Whether you ever heard of Buck Brannaman, own horses or know nothing about them, ""Buck"" the movie is a positive story about overcoming adversity.  A movie for all ages that will leave you feeling good.",1320624000,11,2102,4.576

This is not your typical instructional film and it's easy to see why it received so much attention at Sundance.
This film is a captivating perspective of Buck, and this business of ""natural horsemanship"", that hasn't been shown in any other clinicians production.

The horses I worked with would have been so much happier!  I think one of the most important things that Buck teaches the watcher is the fact that the tools he gives you for working with a horse are also the basic tools for living a good life.
One of the most important and simple things you learn is that you need to make the right thing easy for the horse,  read dog, human etc here) and the wrong thing difficult.  The things you can learn from this video are a very basic beginning. Take a clinic with any good natural horseman or good dog trainer and you come up with a great set of tools to handle most ANY animal! :) Of  course the operant  word here is GOOD. Buck  is one of the very best.
 I aslo learned several new things about him that I hadn't known before. The amazing thing about his being badly abused by his father creating a man who worked so hard to be the very opposite  of him. As you know, usually abuse, gets abuse. To see  it is actually possible for someone to leave the abuse behind and make the opposite his life's goal  is a wonderful thing to see and  know.
 This DVD isn't just for horses lovers. It is a good learning tool for how to get along well in your life and how to treat others.",1319414400,3,1348,4.083650190114068
4664780,5,B005E7SEMU,"Here is a beautifully crafted movie made by first time director Cindy Meehl, a horsewoman who found the passion and drive to tell Buck's story.  She saw first hand that Buck had a gift with horses and the willingness to teach horse folk how to better, as he puts it, ""get with the horse"".

Buck's journey is one of overcoming a cruel and abusive father to make the choice of what kind of man he would become.  His sensitivity extended to the horses he would work and use in his life.  Exposure to great mentors and a real desire to observe and learn from not only mentors but the horses themselves, brought him to see horses as needing what they require in life.  He was fortunate to have been rescued and raised by good people who restored him and set him on the good path.

I admire the role of ""go between"" that Buck has chosen in life.  He has chosen to make life better for the horse that is so often not understood and misused.  The movie shows what is possible between human and horse in the way of a working relationship that is based on respect, empathy, patience, understanding and trust.  The scenes from the clinics that brings Buck's knowledge to horse owners that are having issues or wanting better communication with their horse, were chosen to help illustrate that it is often horses having problems with people rather than people having problems with horses.

Being a horse person myself, I can tell you that most people can't understand that any problem they might have with a horse is because of lack of understanding on their part...not the horse's part.  As Buck states:

""All your horses are a mirror to your soul; and sometimes, you might not like what you see in the mirror.  You can't hold it against him for how his life has been.  Maybe there are some things for you to learn about you; and, maybe the horse is going to be the only damn way you're gonna learn it.""

The movie has powerful illustrations of this to make this film important to not just horse persons.  The choices we make in life are our own...choose wisely.  Scenery, music, Buck's quiet manner in telling his story and communicating with people and animals make for seeing the value and wisdom in this story.",1319328000,3,2203,4.508816120906801

4664782,1,B005E7SEMU,"I found the film entertaining and Buck to be a likeable character; however, I find Buck's horse handling as documented in the film to be appalling. I wish I could give this documentary a zero because it documents such pathetic horsemanship by a man that claims to be a competent professional horseman and claims to have a ""kinship"" with the horse. I make my living training horses and riders to be safe, so I really resent a professional horseman like Buck, who should know better, making drama out of unsafe horse handling in order to make a buck.  This movie shows how low Buck's regard for safety and responsible horsemanship is because a horse handler in the movie gets bit in the face by a horse that was handled in an incompetent and dangerous way and even more pathetic, Buck shows this to the world in this documentary. The mishandled horse gets the death sentence as his reward for his part in this film. You showed great kinship for that unfortunate horse, Buck. Why didn't you help your dangerous horse ""kin"" to survive by training it? You could have made a great movie about saving a dangerous horse's life by teaching it to be safe instead of exploiting the horse's dangerous behavior issues for your glory and profits.

A competent and safe horseman would have taken safety precautions like gelding the dangerous horse before attempting training, muzzling the horse to prevent it from biting and laying it down like Buck did to the dangerous horse in the ""Horse Whisperer"" movie, in order to prevent anyone from getting bit in the face or other injury and to give the horse the best possible chance to learn wanted behaviors for its own survival. Buck has shown in the past that he knows what to do with a dangerous horse like in the ""Horse Whisperer"", movie; Buck laid the dangerous horse down and Robert Redford did not get bit in the face. Instead of safety and responsible horsemanship in this film, we see a man get bit in the face and a horse get the death sentence. It is sad that so many view what is shown in this movie to be 5 stars. Do any of you really care about horses? This documentary showed 0 star safety and horsemanship. Buck should be ashamed of himself.

Buck, please, apologize to the horse world for this pathetic performance and donate your profits from this horse abuse movie to a horse welfare group that will rehabilitate problem horses instead of putting them to death. Buck and your fans, do you really care about horses? Put your money were to your mouth is!

A much better way to spend your time and money if you love horses and want to learn about them is to read a superior book about training horses by a real master horseman. That book is ""My Horses, My Teachers"" by Alois Podhajsky. Here's a quote from page 105, ""One one side there is the unconditional subjection by force and punishment with which the rider may reach his goal more quickly but only if he has a good-natured creature with no tendency to fight. This kind of education, however, will undermine the individual character of the animal and result in obedience out of fear. The brilliance of such a horse will be lost and he will be indifferent towards man or even hostile. If on the other hand, the training of the horse is based on kindness, calmness, and ample reward as well as understanding for his personality, the result will be happy obedience on the part of the horse and pleasure in his work. It make take a little longer than with the other method but there will never be that ugly fight between man and animal. The charm and brilliance of the horse will be maintained, even enhanced, and preserved until his old age.""

Buck's dvd and books are the ""unconditional subjection by force and punishment"" side of training that Podhajsky warns about.

If anyone knows the lady in the movie that owned the stallion that Buck failed to train, please contact me. I would love to talk to her and help her and any horses she still owns.",1319068800,24,3948,4.561354019746121

The principles he explains can be applied to not only horses, but dogs as well. His methods echo those of Cesar Milan, the dog whisperer. You sometimes have to be sharp eyed to spot his subtle moves, but the real story is not about the horses anyway. The real story is how Brannaman has managed to evolve into a strong, mature, zen-like figure who has a philosophy that can be applied to people as well as animals.",1318723200,2,553,4.485148514851486
4664784,5,B005E7SEMU,"While this movie was not the one I thought or hoped it would be, it was an exceptional movie all the same. This movie is about Buck Brannaman, a student of Ray Hunt, who travels 40 weeks of the year to further the Natural Horsemanship movement. What propells this film into movie greatness is the fact that this is an ordinary person who lived through a terrifying brutal childhood and rather than becoming a violent, angry person has dedicated his adult life to becoming an exceptional horse trainer in order to do good for horses and horse keepers of the world. In that sense Buck Brannaman is an exceptional man.

What the film was not about, as I had initially hoped, was a film about a born ""horse whisperer"" who from early childhood has a natural repoire, intimate understanding, and passionate love for the horse and creates a new way of human-horse interaction by truely listening to the animal.

I'm looking forward to watching the film based on my favorite non-fiction horse book, ""The Man who Listens to Horses""/Monty Roberts (the next movie on my list) and seeing how it compares to the ""Horse Whisperer"" and ""Buck"".",1318723200,5,1128,4.720812182741117

The sceens about the horse that had brain damage were heart breaking to watch because I knew nothing could be done. Sometimes this does happen and the girl owning the horse finally seemed to understand that she has major problems too.

4664789,5,B005E7SEMU,"This is an awesome movie. And you can't see it just once. I think it takes a least 3 or 4 viewings before it really starts to sink in and make perfect sense.
There are two sides to this movie. The man part, and the horse part, and they all come together once you finally understand how this is related in the grand scheme of things.
First, Buck Brannaman is immensely likeable. Even before you know what crap he went through as a kid you want to like him. He's laid back, he feels safe, he talks in a reassuring tone of voice, he has a quiet demeanor that make you want hang around. Exactly like the ""passive leader"" Mark Rashid (another horse guru) describes. He also has a cracking sense of humor and seems a genuinely caring and good person. He just makes you feel like having him as a friend.
Second, he's one fine horseman. Among the very finest I'd have to guess. Seeing him work with either innocent but clueless baby colts, or with troubled and even deadly horses, you can see the man has almost an eerie talent for this. He can make decisions too. He can be totally forgiving and he can sentence a horse to death. When he does that though (at the end of the movie in the case of a particularly dangerous horse that just can't be helped) you can see how angry he feels at mankind at this moment for failing this horse and turning him into a beast that just cannot be saved. I bet this horse has haunted a few of Buck's nights ever since...
All in all, after immersing myself in horse litterature, training DVD's, conversation on forums (all that along with actually riding) for a long time, it finally started falling into place for me after seeing this movie. What Buck does is offering deals. To horses, to people, to life. He offers every one the opportunity to make a choice, take a good deal and get better, of leave it and live with the consequences. But in case of the bad choice, he'll offer again. And, as Mark Rashid repeatedly points out, when offered a good deal, horses often become incredibly willing to cooperate and follow a fair human.
I can't say I was having many issues in my relationships before seeing this movie, but I sure know it's helped me applying this philosophy (everybody should be offered their own choices, then take responsability for them) to horses, and grow more confident and better around them. I also loved the part when Buck stressed out the importance of our responsability towards horses, how we must not fail them and give them the best possible education and life so they become worthy individuals, just like with our children. Having 2 3 yrs old at home, my daughter and my filly, it resonated with me very much. I don't think we should get angry at any young child, or young horse. Strict yes, fair always, but angry, never. Buck sure gets down to business as firm as necessary with anyone (horse or human, he can deliver some tough love) but he's always fair, and concerned with being so. After he tells the deadly horse's owner some hard to hear truth and he has her weeping he immediately softens up and asks ""am I fair"". And yes, she agrees that he is.
Cindy Mheel has done a wonderful job of building this movie, the images are beautiful, the soundtrack is suprinsingly good and everything is put together in a very professional and brilliant way.
Either you like horses or not don't let this gem of a movie pass you by. Sure, if you're not a horsey person you'll watch it once, and if you're hoping to become a horseman one day you'll want to watch it over and over again, like I do.",1318118400,18,3544,4.420489296636085
4664790,5,B005E7SEMU,"I saw this documentary in San Francisco when it was released in the movie theater's. This movie has a special meaning for me because I use to live in the northwest and owned horses. I'm also a natropathic doctor who works with animals. The way Buck worked with the horses really moved me. He had a good balance between being gentle and firm while working with each horse. In some parts of the movie you could feel him being one with the essence of the horse. I think it was very important for the filmmaker to reveal information about Buck's difficult childhood. This pain has helped him develop the empathy and understanding he uses in his work with the horses today. He is the real deal when it comes to being called a horse whisperer. I think the only thing lacking in this movie was I wanted it to be longer with more depth about the whole process of being a horse whisperer.

""Buck"" Brannaman is the real deal, a kid taken from his abusive father and raised by foster parents, he learned how to ride, rope and shoe a horse at an early age. His life story is beautifully encapsulated in this documentary, along with marvelous demonstrations of his prowess with horses.

Robert Redford is interviewed because he had been told that Brannaman was a bona fide ""Horse Whisperer."" Once he got past his skepticism, he hired Brannaman as a consultant for the movie and even used him as his body double; they have a great anecdote about the experience.

This is one of the most fascinating documentaries I have ever seen, and this is a movie that appeals to all people, not just horse people. It's hard not to like Buck after hearing his story and listening to him talk. This is a definite must see.

Another thing I love about this movie is that he makes it obvious what is so appealing about the cowboy way of life to those that would just as soon sit in an office on a computer.

So many can relate to his violent childhood to some extent, and you know he perceives this in people with similar backgrounds.  While he understands where they are coming from, he doesn't let them have excuses for bad behavior, and that gives such a fantastic tool for relating to horses.  The movie brings this all out - the terrible fear a small child lived with in the face of a cruel parent, and the whole, mature adult man who had the courage to face his demons and rise above them.  Horses go through the same thing - I can see my sensitive little mare gathering courage and stepping out into a scary situation.  This movie shows how Buck understands this in a horse.  Horses can also be bratty and resistant, and it shows Buck dealing with that behavior in ways a horse can understand -- without hurting them or losing his temper.

I work with horses and use them to help humans who have survived trauma, who have physical challenges, or those who simply want to learn to be around a powerful, gentle, sensitive creature.  Horses are the mirror for the human condition. If you are unbalanced they will not choose to approach you. If you have good, calm, welcoming energy they will be drawn to that. If you are angry - forget it, they will have nothing to do with you. I am delighted with the accurate portrayal of Buck. Kudos to Cindy Meehl and crew on a documentary well done!
If you are not a horse person, you will gain insight into how people can overcome. That old adage that, 'abusers grow up to become abusers' is simply not true. I have several friends that are in the mental health field and they love the film.

If you are a horse person you may find a new path to getting more done with your horse by doing LESS sooner.... ah, that old gem: prepare for the transition and the transition will take care of itself...
Buck is holding the bar high and hoping we can all aspire to finding softness and harmony; in ourselves, with our horses, and in life.

This film is a treasure, we have been invited into the lives of some very special people. Watch it, look in your ""mirror"" assess what is reflected there, change where you need to then go share. Pay it forward and the world will be a better place.

This theme reoccurs throughout this heartwarming video. Buck connects the difficulty people experience with training their horse, with the humans inability to control his own heart.

Your horse is like a mirror. Sometimes you will not like what you see there.

So . . . so . . . true!

Who really, yes, really wants to see the dark side of their soul?

Buck suffered violent abuse (years) in childhood. Fists, screaming, whipped. He saw (lived) the dark side of human life.

Sent to live with family who loved, nurtured and sustained him. He lived the bright side of the human soul for the rest of his life.

Interestingly, he comments:

The abuse made me sensitive to emotion. It made me what I am today.

Fascinating! So counter-cultural (neither victim nor martyr).

Bucks relationship with horses based on genuine compassion. He works to overcome fear, not instill dread. He achieves a warm, trusting bond - not a submissive obedience.

What is so astounding, this connection accomplishes amazing results. Horses dance to the music in both minds!

Most of the video shows Bucks startling successes. Nevertheless, one dramatic story was his effort to recover a brain damaged colt. After working for a while, without success, he reproves the young woman . . .

Youre nuts for having so many studs. Most people don't need studs, and for Gods sake, don't need 18 of them.

I don't know what your trying to prove, and if you have a lot going on in your life probably a lot bigger story than just this horse.

(young woman bows head)

You ought to be a member of a seal team or something, as much risk a you take.

Why don't learn how to enjoy your life?

(sniffling)

This horse tells me a lot about you. Maybe theres . . .maybe theres somethings for you to learn about you that the horses can teach you. Maybe it is the only way you are going to learn it, cause you might not listen from anybody else.

(weeping)

Cowboy shown working with the colt. O.K. Then the colt viscously bites him on the head. Blood, stitches.

 Woman decides that is enough. She will put him down.

Buck expresses - This colt is a predator
