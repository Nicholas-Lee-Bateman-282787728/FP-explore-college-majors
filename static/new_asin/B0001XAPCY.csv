8017725,5,B0001XAPCY,"Tin Tan was the real king of Mexican comedy, a performer loved by all Latin American audiences: he sang and danced, and was a very funny, irreverent and sexy pothead, ready to party. In this movie he is the leader of an inept band of thieves, a sort of Robin Hood who helps people in a poor neighborhood in Mxico City. He does everything to steal, even pretending to teach rich Vitola how to sing opera. His love interest is lovely Silvia Pinal, before her Buuelian films; Marcelo, Borolas and Tun Tun, provide laughs, while Tongolele adds a bit of exotic dancing.",1505174400,,564,4.53921568627451

8017729,4,B0001XAPCY,A simple yet delightful script allowing Tin Tan and his supporting to cast to bring their unique brand of fun and frolic to the screen. This is a sure-fire crowd-pleaser story-on-film which will answer the question: who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?,1140652800,2,263,4.617021276595745
8017730,5,B0001XAPCY,"This movie is not only good because of the several funny gags but it is also because of the cast. A slim Tin-tan looks great as a Pachuco king with a double life: honest workman and gang leader. Silvia Pinal just looks gorgeous. Clearly at her prime. Maybe the acting is not the best one but it is well suited for this easy-going comedy. Director Gilberto Martinez-Solares brings some innovation into this movie involving the actors into a dialogue with the audience. I have never seen another movie of this time showing up this. Could it be said that this movie-audience interaction is an introduction of this director. Aside of technical details, this is a great comedy of the so-called 'Golden Age' of Mexican cinema. Something that should be in the collection of all those interested in the filming of that time in Latin America.",982108800,,833,4.751724137931035
