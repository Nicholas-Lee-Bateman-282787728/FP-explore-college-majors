1422543,4,B00005BGRT,"Okay, it took me a while to recognize that the character of Rossendale was being played by Alexis Denisof a.k.a. Wesley Wyndham-Pryce from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel.""  But the twists of ""Sharpe's Revenge,"" the twelfth of the fourteen adventures of Bernard Cornwell's maverick British officer from the Napoleonic War, were such that I was surprised that Rossendale turns out to be more than a minor character.  We have been waiting for the war to be over, but it turns out the defeat of Napoleon is not the best of all possible worlds for our hero.

In April 1814 Wellington's forces are attacking Toulouse, the final French stronghold still loyal to Napoleon, and when it falls Napoleon falls from power and King Phillipe is restored.  Of course during the final battle another incompetent but well connected officer, Wigram (Tom Hodgkins) is ordered to lead the assault, botches it, and it is up to Major Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) to save the day.  But then several important things happen that ruin the end of the war for our hero.  First, Wigram uses the subject of Sharpe's wife to insult him and set up a duel in defiance of the Duke of Wellington's orders.  Sharpe knows he will be sent home, but that is what he wants since Jane Sharpe (Abigail Cruttenden) has extracted a promise that the battle would be his last.  However, urged on by Lady Molly Spindacre (Connie Hyde), who has her own agenda when she discovers Jane has a signed power of attorney giving her control of Sharpe's 10,000 pounds, Sharpe's wife leaves for home when she hears of the duel.

Meanwhile, Major Ducos (Fodor Atkine) is not only still not dead, despite another opportunity for Sharpe to put Napoleon's master spy out of business, but plotting his final revenge on our hero.  After the duel, in which Sharpe finds a great way of teaching Wigram a lesson, he finds himself arrested.  Not for the duel, but for stealing Napoleon's treasure.  Although defended in court by Frederickson (Philip Whitchurch), who learned his law in a most unusual but totally appropriate way, Ducov has contrived enough evidence to make his convinction and execution almost certain.  So Frederickson and Harper (Daragh O'Malley) break Sharpe out and set off to uncover the truth and save Sharpe's reputation and neck.

The dynamic of ""Sharpe's Revenge"" is different from most of the episodes in the series and not just because the big battle scene comes at the beginning (they still have one at the end).  The most obvious is that Frederickson plays the role Harper usually has when Sharpe is in trouble, but we also have a rather unexpected ally in the French General Calvet (John Benfield), who has been opposing Sharpe on the field of battle for the last several films.  While Sharpe is having problems in France, Jane is back home being swept off her feet by Rossendale and to our surprise she is willing to be seduced.  Meanwhile, Sharpe is being nursed back to health by a young French widow (Ccile Paoli) and while she is interested, he will remain faithful to Jane, unaware she is not doing the same.

This is really the first half of a two-part story, continued in ""Sharpe's Justice.""  That is because as long as he is on the Continent Sharpe can only get his revenge against half of his targets, with the rest awaiting him back home in England.  ""Sharpe's Revenge"" has as much of a ""to be continued"" ending of any of these films and given how rare it is that Sharpe actually kills his enemies in this tales, I have no clue as to how the rest of this one will play out.",1096848000,19,3553,4.681672025723473
1422544,3,B00005BGRT,"Pierre Ducos, like Count Dracula seems to be indestructable. He keeps comming back for more and Sharpe doesn't hesitate to dish it out.
Based on real incidents, SHARPE'S REVENGE has a good plot, but towards the end it becomes a bit bizarre. Some of the acting is really too funny to be taken seriously. The character of Gaston, personal aide to General Calvert reminds me more of a clown, than a trusted servant. He has a few more lines than in other Sharpe films. At times his performance is more like slap stick.
Curiously, riflemen Hagman and Harris are missing from this film.
Of course the war is over and they have been discharged, but the characters should have been involved in the story, even if they were not in the book.
  Fredrickson gets to do a bit of slapstick type comedy of his own, but the character is still interesting. In the book, Sharpe and Fredrickson end their friendship over Lucille and it would have made for a more lively ending for the film. Harper actually has little to say in this one, which is a shame. Jane is more ""bitchy"" in this episode, but nothing like in JUSTICE. In either case, the character is allowed to have more emotion than just worshipping Sharpe. Still, these films are enjoyable and far better than other series.",1011398400,5,1263,4.584070796460177
1422545,4,B00005BGRT,"1814 - Toulouse falls, and with it, Napoleon is exiled to the island of Elba. The war, after nearly 20 years, is over. But Ducos, Napoleon's spymaster and sworn enemy of Richard Sharpe isn't done with him yet. After Sharpe fights a duel against his wife's wishes and Jane runs off to England in a huff, Ducos frames Sharpe for murder and the theft of the former Emperor's treasure. Now Sharpe must make his way across post-war France, aided by allies likely and unlikely, to clear his name and seek his revenge. Meanwhile, Jane is proving less than loyal to her husband...
A typical Ducos plot (although not as intricate as the one in ""Sharpe's Honour""), this has the elements we've grown to know and love. Sharpe gets framed, escapes from death and has to regain his honour. Harper and Frederickson are superb in their acting and banter, and even though they replaced the actor who originally played General Calvert in ""Siege"" and ""Mission"", Calvert gets some of the best lines and plays off Sharpe superbly. Ignore Jane's little peccadiloes in London - they are way too painful to watch, and besides, Sharpe finally meets the love of the rest of his life in the Frenchwoman Lucille Mailliot - the scenes of Sharpe recuperating on her Normandy farm are beautifully brought out by Sean Bean. We've never seen Sharpe this happy, and from that alone we know he's found his place after all the wars are over.
I won't say much more because I recommend it heartily. A fine Sharpe adventure.",989712000,6,1485,4.693486590038314
1422590,5,B00005BGRT,"Sean Bean is cast in his best part in my opinion, as well as Daragh O'Mally and all of the ""Chosen Men"" I wish there were more, the last two are Sharpe's Peril and Sharpe's Challenge. All the gals out there should love this series if you like War mixed with some love the trust of his men and all of the characters.",1326153600,,315,4.015873015873016
1422591,4,B00005BGRT,"Great story and acting, but video quality is sub standard due to producing it from old 1980's TV production. Good buy all the same. Great series.",1266451200,,145,4.615384615384615
1422592,5,B00005BGRT,"The Sharpe films bring the Napoleonic Era to life.  The story of a common man, who has to work his way up the ranks with bold action after bold action.  Sean Bean makes the lead character a hero for the ages.  I have read the books and enjoyed them.  The movies though different at times still deliver the fun and excitement of these great stories.",1265932800,,348,4.3076923076923075
1422593,5,B00005BGRT,This collection of Sharpe's adventures captures the Napoleonic age like no other movie or series. Sean Bean carries the stories ably assisted by an excellent cast. It swings from high action to quiet drama always leaving you satisfied but at the same time wanting more. Not to be missed!,1259712000,,287,4.877551020408164
1422594,5,B00005BGRT,"Classic Sharpe! I found it was less expensive to buy all the mini collections than it would be to buy the complete collection set. I'm glad I went this route - after all, when it comes down to it, it's about the stories, not a fancy box.",1258070400,,237,4.0638297872340425
1422595,5,B00005BGRT,"Having for years appreciated and depended on the reviews here it is time to give back.

I stumbled on this series at least 10 years ago and the more I watched the more I enjoyed the stories and the historical settings and began video-taping (yes, with a now antique VCR) and was frustrated not to have the missing episodes. I cannot say that the settings are accurate but, as one who has appreciated the study of history and human developement (and frailties)I found the more human characterizations to be refreshing and more realistic.  People and motivations have not changed thruout history.

I finally bought the entire set (not boxed) and am glad I did.  I buy only what I feel that I will want to watch ever year or so and this fits.",1257120000,2,739,4.533834586466165
1422596,5,B00005BGRT,I love this series.  I enjoy historical fiction and this series is as correct in detail as any period representation could be.  If you like films of the Napoleonic Era I highly recommed this series.,1238976000,,198,4.628571428571429
1422597,4,B00005BGRT,"I took a brief break from reading, watching, and reviewing Sharpe, but soon enough I had to dive in again with Sharpe's Revenge.  The first of 1997's Sharpe's telefilms, Revenge pulls out all the stops onscreen and off.

Now that the war with Napoleon is nearing its end, Major Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) places his 10,000 guinea fortune in his wife Jane's (Abigail Cruttenden) power of attorney. She makes him promise that this will be his final battle, but after one too many insults, Sharpe fights a duel after the war is concluded. Angered and influenced by her power hungry friends, Jane takes Sharpe's money and returns to England, where she is charmed by Lord Rossendale (Alexis Denisof, Angel). Sharpe, however, cannot pursue Jane, for he is framed for stealing Napoleon's treasure by French Master Spy Pierre Ducos (Feodor Atkine). Along with Sergeant Patrick Harper (Daragh O'Malley) and Captain Frederickson (Philip Whitchurch), Sharpe escapes his trial to find the French witness who could clear him. Unfortunately, Sharpe is wounded by French widow Lucille (Cecile Paoli). Once recovered, Sharpe must unite with French Colonel Calvet (John Benfield) to defeat Ducos once and for all.

Despite the absence of series stalwarts Harris, Hagman, and even Wellington, the cast of Sharpe's Revenge is perhaps at its best. Bean adds a new element of hurt and anger as the jilted husband, and Daragh O'Malley is true again as ever loyal Patrick Harper. Atkine is slick to the hilt as Ducos, and after disliking Calvet for several episodes, it's a fine turnaround to see the fallen commander as another displaced soldier after a lifetime of war. The glue of Revenge, however, is Phillip Whitchurch as `Sweet' William Frederickson. His soldier gritty, grisly appearance meets his intelligent and loyal self here. Who knew what Frederickson would do for Sharpe-or what Sharpe could inadvertently do to his Captain? The depth here has me looking forward to the Revenge novel.

Not only does writer Eoghan Harris and director Tom Clegg give us a worthy story adaptation, but production at last has caught up with the show. This was the height of Sharpe and the series pulls out all the stops here. The locations are fresh and dressed to the hilt. Jane's splendor in London is indeed richy rich. The established electric guitar Sharpe themes open and close the movie, but a lovely score echoes Sharpe's respite in Normandy. True instrumental compositions, eureka! Revenge finally puts everything all together. Sure we have the guilty pleasures that make Sharpe Sharpe, but we have extra high class touches that give this episode some umph. It's as if we're done with the action, so now's the time to reflect upon the characters who bring the show-these books-to life.

At the time, Sharpe's Revenge and the subsequent Justice and Waterloo were to be the final Sharpe shows. (Now we have two more, the two part Challenge and the forthcoming Peril.) This, however, would be a fitting place to end the series. Fine send offs, peace at last. Irony of ironies Sharpe has found a home with Lucille in Normandy. I like her and Cecile Paoli's performance. She's not ugly, but not sexed up as previous women have been. Well, I take that back. We are definitely made aware of Lucille's unconventional hotness! Strange then to see the opposite side of the coin in the wayward Mrs. Sharpe (and real life Mrs. Bean). Denisof's Rossendale is obvious to everyone but Jane, who is now played perfectly by Cruttenden. Jane is pomp and pompous and too late realizes the error of her ways. Three episodes ago she was abhorred at the notion of auctioning of soldiers `like slaves'. Yet in Revenge, Jane has invested in slave and cotton stock to up keep her lavish lifestyle. Tut tut.

Although there's no real connection to the previous film, Sharpe's Mission, Revenge's story continues into Sharpe's Justice. Again, you don't have to see the follow up, but how could you not want to? I wouldn't introduce new fans to the series with this episode, however. There's a tying up loose ends feeling here that can only be appreciated by series fans that have been on this ride all along. Fans that haven't seen the series in a while will have a good time. Look for the DVDs, if you haven't done so already.",1229299200,12,4279,4.895172413793103
1422598,5,B00005BGRT,"Although Sharpe is like an early day six million dollar man with more lead in his body than is in an armament this is a don't miss series. We originally watched each episode on BBC America and would recommend the entire series so much so that we bought the dvd's and have watched each episode over and will do so again. There are some truly memorable individuals, but the one that stands out for me is the grizzly old sargeant that is played to perfection in the early episodes by Pete Postlethwaite. I would highly recommend this series to anyone with an interest in early military battles and also to anyone who just enjoys some good drama. Hats off to British Television once again for a first class series.",1167782400,,710,4.511627906976744
1422599,5,B00005BGRT,"Sean Bean does it again. Playing Richard Sharpe of his majesty's 95th rifles. Sharpe comes forth again in this rich story of love, betrayal and swashbucking action. I enjoyed the earlier Sharpe series that was shown on PBS and again on the history channel. Unfortunately not all were ever shown on American TV.
