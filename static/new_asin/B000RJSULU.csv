8201077,5,B000RJSULU,"I loved this show.  In fact, I bought this show via Ebay about two years ago.  I was so hooked that I finished the show in one weekend.  The story is awesome and the action is better than other Korean action TV shows.
Without giving away the story, this is about a brother and a sister who get separated when their father was framed and killed (sort of).  Anyway, they led a different life style, but later on they kind of find each other... (don't want to give away the ending).  If you like Korean Shows, then this is a must for you.  I certainly enjoyed it.",1242432000,,560,4.186915887850467
