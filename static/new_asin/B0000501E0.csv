But from these movies, you get an incomplete picture of Glenn Milstead. (Divine.)  SHe also had a fantastic night club act.  SHe entertained all over Europe with this act in the 80's

So get this DVD and experience the raw talent of Divine.  HIr talent was raw and raunchy in more ways than one!  But we still love HIr!",1231200000,,431,4.448717948717949
7928569,4,B0000501E0,"Divine, of John Waters fame, had a neat dance music career in the early 80's.  This DVD contains 2 recordings of concerts he performed in Europe.  The songs are catchy.  It is hard to find footage of Divine performing live.  This is a real gem.  Although the visual quality ranks about 3 out of 5 stars, it is still enjoyable to watch.  I was not disappointed at all with my purchase.  You will not either.  This would also make a great gift for anyone who was in the club scene in the early 80s.",1199059200,,496,4.202127659574468
7928570,3,B0000501E0,"This DVD gives us two concerts by Divine. Live At The Hacienda and Shoot Your Shot have similar song sets and Divine seems to enjoy being onstage

One reviewer notes that the crowd at The Hacienda is somewhat subdued; and they are right! I was surprised at how even the front row members of the audience reacted to the concert as if it were little more than a routine trip to the supermarket.

Divine sings and performs well as he goes through strong song sets and his outrageous act would still get crowds today. His makeup is great and his voice is in pretty good form.

Unfortunately, for me at least, there are two disappointments. First, Divine doesn't exactly sing as sweetly as Paul McCartney ever sang. His voice is good but it's rough at the edges. Second, the quality of the video seems to be little more than that what you would get with a camcorder to make a home movie.

On the brighter side, the DVD also comes with plenty of information of Divine's filmography and his other works; the menu is easy to use and you can choose scene selection if you want to see a particular song one more time.

Overall, this DVD gives us two concerts by the late Divine which clearly demonstrate his love for entertaining and his zest for being outrageous on stage. He was one driven guy! The quality of the print, however, is just average; and Divine's voice isn't exactly Sinatra's.

I recommend this DVD for Divine's fans. People who like Hi-NRG music from the early 1980s will also enjoy the numbers Divine performs.",1196812800,,1518,4.542124542124542

What the hell's wrong with them ZOMBIE people at the Hacienda? DIVINE is singing her raspy heart out & them FLIPPERS ""R"" just standing around like they just ate a vegetable platter. You FLIPPERS should of just stayed home & watched re-runs of Little House On the Prairie. Boot 2 the head 2 you HACIENDA DEAD HEADS!! This DVD kicked AZZ!! There ""R"" 2 performances on this DVD & well worth the cash (especially @ the AMAZON price). Do yourself a favor & pick this one up (the DVD not DIVINE, you'll get a Himana). We miss u DIVINE especially DJ WACK ""O"" (Cult Movies Magazine & Orbital Traxx Records)",1128038400,3,732,4.42962962962963
7928573,5,B0000501E0,"I really like this DVD of Divine live from the Hacienda. This was a must buy for me because Divine performs the classics of the 80's. This was filmed in 1983 when Hi-NRG was at its peak, and when Hi-NRG was still very underground. This is great for anyone who likes Divine or Hi-NRG music. Although, Divine does some tasteless things throughout the show, it's still a gem to add to the Divine Collection. Any Bobby ""O"" fans also need to buy this. Bobby ""O"" isn't in the video, but just knowing that Bobby ""O"" produced most of Divine's classics is another reason to purchase this video. Buy this and keep it. One of these days it will be out of print, so get it while you can. In case you did not know the Hacienda is owned by New Order.",1038873600,7,736,4.226950354609929
7928574,5,B0000501E0,"This is a rare filmed concert of Divine Live in the 80's. This was filmed in London. I own this on video ,and it is a fun and racy concert. It shows Divine at her/his best in a  Gay club with a live audience. Divine of John Waters cult films of the 70's and 80's shows off his er ample talents and performs some of his dance hits of the era. This is a great piece of history for all John Waters/ Divine fans!!!",974678400,13,410,3.880952380952381
