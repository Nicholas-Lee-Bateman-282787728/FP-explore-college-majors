8380108,5,B002TCRQ54,"PBS's influential documentary series ""Frontline"" explores the death of Neda Agha Soltan, a beautiful young Iranian woman killed while watching a protest of the controversial and fraudulent 2009 Iranian presidential election. Neda's death was filmed on a cell phone and uploaded to the Internet, documenting the extent of the political turmoil in Iran and how new methods of communication are changing the way news is reported. This documentary is about an oppressive regime using violence to stay in power. The Ayatollah had the option to end the strife with a recount, but he did not; his siding with Ahmadinejad showed just how out of touch he was not only with the public but also with his own position (which is supposedly to temper the power of the president). Ahmadinejad isn't a religious man; none of this has to do with being a Muslim. It has *everything to do with power.*",1361577600,2,882,4.886666666666667
8380109,5,B002TCRQ54,"Well before I start this review, I will start off by saying that I am no expert in Iran.  I am going by what news and general consensus is and news shows like Frontline to talk about Iran.

This episode details the murder of Neda Agha Soltan. You may have remembered her face during the summer of last year (it's hard not to) as her death was aired on air on Tv and broadcast to the world. Neda's death reminded Americans and other nations why Iran is a place that should not be ignored and a place with officials that should be watched very closely. Now that's half the story here. No the other story is learning about this  lady Nega. Frontline gives you all the details about her life and how her death was pretty much unwarranted and an act of terror by the Basij. The Basij is a paramilitary, militia force. The Basij don't stop though with Neda's death.  Neda's family for instance isn't even  allowed to hold a proper ceremony for her. Any of her friends or family who speak out are punished severely and are threatened with death. Neda's boyfriend, Caspian,  we learn eventually has to flee Iran.

As we see, it seems to be customary rule that anybody who voices an opinion about the government, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or officials in power are dealt with through violent means to silence them. Other times the military and government do unethical things to erase any sort of hint of dissidence against them.

For example, when several protesters wrote Neda's name as a remembrance, the government keeps on erasing it.  Later the government sickeningly tries to label Neda as a terrorist to excuse her murder.

Protesters against Mahmoud , as it's well documented here, don't like the guy for rigging the elections in Iran.  We see footage of the military police shutting down one of Mousavi's polling offices and interior ministry. The media in Iran  is already designating Mahmoud as the winner despite the controversy.  We see amateur footage captured by protesters of  Basij beating up protesters who were angered by Mahmoud's alleged victory.  Reporter Scott Peterson offers his throughout the episode including how Mahmoud was planning this election for years.

By the end of this episode, we learn quite a bit about Iran as far as current politics, this crazy guy Mahmoud and his rise to power. i It's hard not to disagree with that opinion Mahmoud has all the characteristics of a terrorist after watching this episode, learning and seeing all the events that led Mahmoud's rise to power, Neda's death, and the thuggish, violent actions of the military and government.",1272412800,5,2581,4.7792792792792795
