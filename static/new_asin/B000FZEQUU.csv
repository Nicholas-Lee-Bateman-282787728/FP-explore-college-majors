2593224,5,B000FZEQUU,"Move over ""Sesame Street,"" it's ""Reading Rainbow!"" This is a wonderful children's series, which encourages children to read. Each segment has children giving a brief description of the book they read.

Be prepared to go on to a journey of make-believe, and have fun while you're doing it by reading the suggested books these children recommend!

I grew up on this show in the 80's, and it's amongst the best educational shows. The theme song inspires children to reach beyond the sky's limits and explore the wonderful world of reading!

This series is perfect and entertaining for the child who enjoys reading, and even for the child, who doesn't like reading.

Highly recommended for children, parents and teachers, alike!

Buy it today, you'll be glad you did!",1183680000,24,763,4.9763779527559056

It is a wonderful show that I think should have never gone off the air.

Crispycritters delivery was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase learning toys.",1295308800,,178,5.884615384615385
2593229,5,B000FZEQUU,I bought these for my classroom. They are excellent.  I highly recommend them for home or class use.  My 1st graders love Reading Rainbow. Wish you had more as I bought the only ones I could find on Amazon.,1274572800,,206,4.256410256410256
2593230,4,B000FZEQUU,"I bought these DVD's for my 7yr old. I read to him all the time and he's always walking around with a book in his hand. He really enjoyed the DVD's but I was disappointed. I expected to hear the ORIGINAL theme song from the 80's. What you get on the DVD's in the newer version of the song from the 90's, I think, which SUCKS. Other than that the DVD's are great.",1266710400,15,362,3.9726027397260273
2593231,5,B000FZEQUU,"It is a sad news that this show went off the air officially this year after 26 years providing joy of reading books and exploring the subjects for children and adults. I wish they produced all the episods in this format; however, if you are a fan of reading rainbow and enjoy watching with kids, you won't be disapointed to own it. Each disk contains two episods and bonus features from other similer episods that didn't make it into this box set. My daughter totally loves ""Let's Go"" dvd because of that she likes trains, hot-air balloons and maps, and a big fan of Lavar. I believe it's a great show to watch no matter how much some of the episods are old.",1259452800,8,658,4.357723577235772
2593232,5,B000FZEQUU,I grew up in the mid and late 80's and this show is the very reason  I LOVE reading and consider myself a bookworm.,1256256000,,115,3.7916666666666665
2593233,5,B000FZEQUU,"I bought this item for a gift.  Although my great-grandson is too young right now for it, I am sure he will enjoy it in years to come.  I know his mommy was thrilled with it.  I appreciated the swift shipping of it.",1254441600,,215,3.953488372093023
2593234,5,B000FZEQUU,"I purchased it for my daughter and ourselves. we're not sure if she would like it or not, but she loved it. It's very sad to see this show off the air after 26yrs. Hopefully this company would produce more dvd sets for those love and enjoy the show.",1252281600,,249,4.1020408163265305
2593235,4,B000FZEQUU,"I bought this to show my 2nd grade class. Reading Rainbows, in general are tops, but some are better than others. I like 3 out of the 4 DVDs,(but for the price, it is worth it even for the 3). I judge this purely by my class, they were not wild about the DVD that pertains to music. One of the episodes on that one is an older one, and honestly we didn't even finish it, but if I remember, it didn't use the typical Reading Rainbow format. All the other episodes in this collection were a big hit though, and the DVD with Taxi Dog on it was worth it right there!",1242691200,24,562,3.982300884955752
2593236,5,B000FZEQUU,"The favorite TV show of my children was Reading Rainbow.  The explanation to go with each story, the tours of factories to show how something was made are memories they carry today.  I purchased this set for my Grandchildren as we can't even find reruns of this spectacular childrens program.  My daughter can delight is telling her children about her favorite Reading Rainbow stories - two of which are in this set.
The facts Lavar Burton presents to the children are remembered.  They do think about the whales and mannatee - two favoriet topics for a library trip.",1215129600,7,567,4.755102040816326

8127696,5,B000FZEQUU,I absolutely loved this program as a child. Takes children on a mini field trip right in their own home. The stories are wonderful. A must have for any child's dvd library. There is a lot of disappointing programs out there. Rest assured that this is not one of them. A + all the way.,1413331200,2,284,4.181818181818182
8127697,1,B000FZEQUU,I thought it would be a good idea to buy her this set but turns out I was wrong. I had to almost force her to watch it and with the out dated look and feel it couldn't hold her attention at all. I wouldn't suggest it unless your child is use to watching older shows. It also doesn't help them learn how to read which is the main reason i bought it.,1369872000,2,348,3.780821917808219

8127699,5,B000FZEQUU,"My daughter is 2 years old. Instead of filling her head with silly dumb cartoon
characters like Spongebob Squarepants, I scavenged for ""Reading Rainbow.""

This is one of the forefathers of ""edu-tainment!""
I thought it'd be too much for her & she'd be bored quickly.
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.

The way she runs from one room and zips to the TV when she hears the intro.
The absolute unencumbered joy to sing along with the original format & Chaka Khan.
I find myself looking at the videos again with my girl because they hold up in story
and learning, over 20 years later! I even laugh how some of the ""dated"" clothes are
coming back into fashion. She can watch an entire DVD in one sitting. She'd watch
the entire box set if she knew how to change out the DVDs herself!

Daya won't leave the house now without a book in hand.
I give thanks to you Levar & The Reading Rainbow crew.
Only one word can describe the value of this series: priceless.

Now if I can get Daya hooked on 3-2-1 Contact as well...Hmmmm.:)",1337126400,8,1005,4.387096774193548
8127700,5,B000FZEQUU,"I grew up on Reading Rainbow as did many people I know.  To share this with my children is a great feeling. It makes you want to read and learn.  But my only issue with these dvd's is that they are not in HD. Very old school, that was a little disappointing.",1326240000,,258,3.9423076923076925
