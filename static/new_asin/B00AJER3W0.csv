8552634,4,B00AJER3W0,"This DVD is the followup to the previous show - Breakfast Special - that came out about a year ago. Producer/Director/Narrator Rick Sedak found some more independent restaurants that specialize in - usually, very LARGE - breakfast menus. Patterned after the Food Network's ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives"" the 56 minute show shows Sedak (actually it never SHOWS him, but he's apparently there) visiting about a dozen places and interviewing customer and management on why they like that particular place. He covers 2 in his native Pittsburgh and three in Hawaii as well as others in Raleigh,NC, New Hampshire, Detroit, Norwalk, CT, and my home base of Philadelphia. Sadly, the Philly place, Carmen's closed about a week after Sedak filmed his show.

You should not watch this show on an empty stomach - or if on a diet. While it may not send you out on a cross country road trip to visit these places the show may encourage you to seek out local breakfast spots in your area.

The bonuses here are minimal. There are 6-short ""promos"" for the show - total time about 2  minutes and four outher short pieces of a minute or less.

I'm guessing there will soon be a BS3. There are soooooo many great diners and breakfast spots in this country.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
