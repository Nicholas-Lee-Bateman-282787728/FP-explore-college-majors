8548075,5,B00A7ZXMO4,El Generico is easily the best baby face of this generation. His ability to sell through his mask is amazing. Super fun matches on both discs. Well worth the money.,1426377600,,164,4.5
8548076,5,B00A7ZXMO4,"The only wrestler compilation that PWG has released, The Many Adventures of El Generico can be enjoyed by anyone with any interest whatsoever in professional wrestling. One of the most beloved wrestlers to work the independent circuit ever, El Generico has had countless awe-inspiring matches. The matches on this set are all from Pro Wrestling Guerilla, which is one of, if not the best independent promotions in the world. Add all that up (with a healthy dose of comedy for good measure) and you get 2 awesome discs of the global phenomenon known as El Generico!

*El Generico has since been signed to WWE and wrestles under the ring name Sami Zayn!",1368403200,4,651,4.8125
