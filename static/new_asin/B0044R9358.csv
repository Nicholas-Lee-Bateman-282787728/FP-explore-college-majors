8416286,3,B0044R9358,"This pretty much met my expectation. The documentary is well crafted but is sort of an ""appologetic memoir"" or ""unappologetic"" depending on your viewpoint. Interviewed persons sort of served as commentary in a very personal way about Hef. It was an educational biography and contained a little bit ""too"" little sensational reel footage of the enterprise. Overall, it's a good historical documentation, in which I learned quite a bit and found him to be a generous individual with his stories. I would have liked to see comparative reference to his counterparts during the 60's, such as Bob Gucione and Lary Flint - no mention of those at all.",1437264000,,642,4.953703703703703
8416287,5,B0044R9358,"This is an excellent documentary.  Hugh Hefner has been as influential on the world's imagination and value system as Walt Disney.  The documentary remains interesting through its 2-hour run, because there are a balance of perspectives on his legacy, interviews of him, video footage throughout the decades, and newspaper clips, and the whole documentary flows with no narration.  (And there are images from Playboy magazines, which is why it's rated R.)  I would have a very negative view of the documentary if it was stacked with just praise of the man and stories of his crazy Playboy Mansion, but conservatives Pat Boone and Dennis Prager, and at least one feminist who's opposed to his agenda, are given time to share their opinions in interviews.  I agree with their perspective on the damage Hefner's done to relationships in society.  My favorite statement is Prager's, that Hugh Hefner's lifestyle works for him because he isn't responsible to any of the women, but if you're not wealthy and don't have an endless supply of women, it's unsustainable, and bad for relationships throughout society regardless.  Hefner hasn't been able to maintain any of his relationships indefinitely, and it's surprising to me how much admiration there is among intelligent people such as Dick Cavett and Mike Wallace for him.

The most surprising aspects of the documentary for me are how much involvement Hefner had in the integration of blacks and whites in the 50s and 60s, and the devious ways the government attempted to stop him in different eras.  Hefner also reveals in interview clips (done exclusively for this documentary maker, Brigitte Berman) the source of his liberal attitude toward sex early on, saying his parents had Puritan values and he was not hugged as a child.  Many people who reject organized religion, including Hefner, also reject Bible-based morality, because of personal experiences with too much strictness without enough love.  Gene Simmons of KISS, black comedian Dick Gregory, and he share a lot in common in their opinions interspersed through the documentary, believing organized religion has no business telling them what sexual ""morality"" is when organized religion is okay with racism and is hateful and supports wars.  So instead of having a good reason for supporting a sexually loose attitude, they excuse it by saying the alternative, which is organized religion, is bad.  I mention this as an example of the thought-provoking disputes that go on throughout this documentary, which are interspersed with interesting stories and history which moves through the decades.",1425859200,2,2604,5.215827338129497
