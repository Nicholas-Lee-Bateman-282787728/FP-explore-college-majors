The songs are very well constructed and very unique in the way they were able to sing the poems with the music.  The vocalist has a great voice and sounds very good.  The music is very good and has the Tangerine Dream sound to it.  It is definitely different from other Tangerine Dream CDs, but they are always doing something different.",1465344000,,474,4.222222222222222

8343489,4,B001UEFHKS,"This took a little getting used to for me, but the more I play it the better I like it. The vocals take the forefront while the music is in the supporting roll. I pretty much always like what TD does even when it goes down some unusual path like ""Dantes Inferno"" or ""Paradiso"", and this is one of those other paths. If you are a ""Straight TD"" fan you may not like it at first, but you might find you grow to like it later. The vocalist has a dynamic range and reminds me a little bit of YES's Jon Anderson abet with deeper voice. Once I got used to the music being the support of the voice, I found myself humming along with it. This is almost entirely a studio album, shot indoors with some special effects here and there. The interesting part was seeing the musicians playing instruments that they don't usually play, they are quite versitle.",1398211200,2,844,4.28125

I totally enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys TD's performances.",1282867200,5,241,4.761904761904762
