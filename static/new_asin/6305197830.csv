987739,4,6305197830,Typical of european films Go Now takes a very small slice of life and puts it under a microscope.  Here a working class couple are shown dealing-or not-with the everyday issues which arise when he is stricken with ms. The  film  accuratly reveals the impact of the disease process on every aspect  of the couple's life.  The acting is powerful and truthful. The subtext  reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the human spirit when challenged by  life altering circumstances.,935020800,10,476,4.949367088607595

A touching, uplifting film by the same folks that brought you the depressingly gritty TRAINSPOTTING a few years back.  GO NOW is the story of Nick Cameron played by Robert Carlisle, a  rugby player and his girlfriend  and their life together.  This may sound boring, but it's a well acted and  like many films from the UK, very under played and cast with real looking  people. It's slow pace might annoy American viewer used to US films, but we  get to know the characters in this story. I felt like I was meeting real  people as opposed to cardboard characters we find in so many Hollywood  flics. We first meet Nick as a very uncoordinated, ""blind"" rugby, (or is it  soccer?) player, the victim of the coach's verbal abuse and scorn of his  ""mates"".  A construction worker by day, he quickly finds his life making  several uncomfortable turns when he looses his grip on a heavy hammer as he  climbs up to his work site on a new building. With love and support from  Karin his girlfriend he faces challenges no one should ever have to.
""Go Now"", the old Moody Blues classic is heard throughout the film.  I  am a long time Moody Blues fan and GO NOW caught my attention simply by the  title and the use of the song in the film.  ""Go Now"", the song is strange  choice for a song at the film's ending.  The theme of the song and the  theme of the movie do not match.  But the movie, in spite of it's  mismatched theme and title is still a good film.
However, the depiction  of premarital sex and co-habitation and liberal use of the ""F"" and ""S""  words makes it inappropriate for kids.

7885095,5,6305197830,"Shortly after my MS diagnosis, my girlfriend at the time excitedly told me about this movie she saw in a local bargain art movie house on a free day.  We rented the movie, and wow... obviously I'm closer to the subject than most, having MS, but dealing with adjustment, pain, and self-identity all while trying to stay connected to those close to us is the universal human condition, right?  Robert Carlyle is great as usual. The icing on the cake was the terrific soundtrack.  While Carlye's character is given a spinal tap, 'Three', by Massive Attack, plays in the background: 'Three's my lucky number, And fortune comes in threes... Oh, I'm missing everything I knew... Yet wish i knew nothing at all...' A soulful look at when your number comes up.",1104969600,3,752,4.7251908396946565

As Nick's physical condition worsens, it is up to his girlfriend Karen (Juliet Aubrey) to help Nick see his way through his difficult struggle. Karen is urged at the hands of her best friend to leave Nick, but she (Karen) feels she needs to be around him to be of help and for added companionship. At the same time, Karen feels she is missing out sexually, so she is seeing someone else in the meantime to satisfy her needs in this department. Still, she feels Nick needs her, who, because he feels that Karen feels sorry for him, Nick urges her to leave him, but she refuses. ""Go Now"" is a heart-warming story that'll possibly bring a tear to your eye. The main problem with this picture is that it's extermely short, at under an hour-and-a-half long.
