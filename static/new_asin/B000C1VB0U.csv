8095154,3,B000C1VB0U,"Gravion is not a great series. It falls into too many stereotypes and cookie-cutter echi characters for that. But beyond its many flaws is some redeemable story-lines, some nostalgic mecha action, and something good for that Saturday night in. Guilty pleasure it may be but a pleasure still.",1410998400,,291,5.083333333333333
8095155,5,B000C1VB0U,"If you like cool sci-fi/action anime with cute and busty girls, this is for you! You may have to do some digging to get a hold of this, but it's worth it. Great plot and dub. Beware, there is a second season to make this a complete story. (I bought that one too.)",1404691200,,263,3.981132075471698
8095156,4,B000C1VB0U,"I rented the first disc of Gravion after I finished Godannar Vol. 5. I have to wait 2 months for volume 6 so I figured I'd give Gravion a shot. I knew I could get the whole series for only 30 bucks so if i liked the first disc, I could just buy it cheap. Well, after watching the first disc my wife and I went out and bought the box set and finished all 13 episodes that night. Now all things considered: price A+, animation B-, music A-, japanese acting B english C, writing/story B, characters B, and so on, this is a solid collection. I noticed on most of the episodes that the time went pretty fast. I mean I couldn't believe it was almost over when i looked at the time. It was that engaging. Some animes I'm hoping for the end of the episode already but this one rarely did that. I will say however that in a couple of episodes it did end too quickly. Kind of like, okay we finally found out how to defeat the alien and now we are out of time so one slash, end, and music. Overall the animation was good but near the end you could tell they were either running out of money or time because some scenes were drawn subpar as well as the definition and color. As for the writing, It was pretty good. I know ""aliens invade earth, send in the robo-protector"" isn't new but it was what the writers did to keep that age old concept fresh. For example How do you form your big robot when missing a pilot? And if you can, what are the consequences? The music was great in this as well. You have to have a great ""merging"" song in these shows and you get one as well as a good opening and closing song. I liked these characters too. The pilots were funny and interesting. The fan service was minimal. Now as a big fan of Godannar I have seen fan service. Gravions fan service was nothing compared to Godannars. I also thought the characters had enough backround and the ones who didn't needed to stay mysterious and I think that helped their character strength. Well this is getting long, in conclusion, this series was very good. It gave me what I was looking for, something to tide me over till the next installment of Godannar comes out. If you are a fan of Godannar, Gravion is not on par with Godannar in almost every category but its still very good for what it is and as its own show. I hope Gravion Zwei ends the series well because Gravion was a great beginning.",1148169600,5,2366,4.190789473684211
8095157,1,B000C1VB0U,"This show is often compared to Godannar, another robot fighting anime that came out at approximately the same time. So for 30 bucks, I figured I'd give this a shot. What a waste of my money. In the end, all I can say is that I've got yet another example of why anime fans' opinions should be taken with a grain of salt.

This show is often referred to as one of those big-booby-girly animes. But this show is not girly in the slightest. This show, like Godannar, centers around robot fighting and tries to be reasonably serious. That's neither a good or a bad thing, just a description of what to expect. Don't be misled by the box covers or anime fan reviews.

However, unlike Godannar, this show has awful drawings, awful animation, no plot, and is totally boring. It is a poorly directed and poorly executed show. I've lost all respect for director Masami Obari (Fatal Fury movies, which I thought were great) after seeing this series. Viewers should be allowed to form their own opinions about whether or not they like the drawing style in this series, so I won't say whether I think it is good or bad. However, what is inarguable is that the drawings are of poor quality. That is to say, they are inconsistently done, and every episode is severely ""degenerated"" (a well-known anime phenomena, where certain episodes may look worse than others due to different, unskilled people doing the key animation). The animation is ultra cheap and frame-saving throughout the series. Seeing this series makes me lose some respect for Gonzo, the animation studio responsible for this show. Some Gonzo shows look amazing with top-quality animation, but Gravion is not one of them unfortunately.

Even the way the video was mastered seems riddled with problems. It feels as if Gonzo did not know how to produce a digital anime when seeing this show, however that cannot be as Gonzo has produced other excellent digital animes, some before Gravion (such as Vandread). So I don't know what went wrong here. In some sequences, such as the Gravion fusing transformation sequence, the video is all choppy because it has been incorrectly mastered with 5:4 (24 fps to 30 fps progressive) pulldown, which is WRONG and should never be done. Unacceptable.

A terrible series. Complete garbage. I have nothing against this type of show (I rate Godannar, a similar show, as the best show I've ever seen in my life) but Gravion is super low-budget and low-quality and deserves to be thrown in the trash.",1140480000,9,2481,4.7627906976744185
