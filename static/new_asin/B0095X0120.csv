5271961,5,B0095X0120,My son love this DVD it's about 2hrs long it really good.,1416873600,,57,3.8333333333333335
5271962,5,B0095X0120,"My great-grandson listens & watches this EVERY day!!  He loves Elmo and Cookie Monster now and if I just start singing one of the songs, he smiles or starts laughing.  I've now bought him a little Elmo and a Cookie Monster!!!  Great DVD!!!",1411776000,2,239,4.511627906976744
5271963,5,B0095X0120,I bought this for my niece and nephews. They love it. And I don't mind watching with them,1409702400,3,89,4.0
5271964,5,B0095X0120,"I have to say this DVD is ok with the Muppet cast. The
only problem with this there isn't any human cast except
for Susan. They needed more human people in it.",1407024000,,159,4.0
5271965,5,B0095X0120,"I don't know who loves this DVD more - my husband, me or our 16 month daughter. It is laugh out loud funny. It's educational too. It's about two hours long, is loaded with Muppets and packed with tons of singing. The music is catchy and my husband and I find ourselves singing the songs to our daughter. Theres a mixture of classic songs such as C is for Cookie by Cookie Monster, Nasty Dan w/Oscar the Grouch featuring Johnny Cash and new (well, new to me) songs such as Elmos World and Celebrity Lullaby w/Elmo featuring Ricky Gervais. While I do not condone children watching hours of what my mom called ""the idiot box"", (I'm a child of the 70s) I feel better about our young daughter watching Sesame Street over any other television show. Although I think she'd enjoy ""Sesame Street The Best of Friends"" more if she were a bit older, it keeps her entertained and is lengthy enough to allow parents to complete stuff.",1401235200,4,920,4.482142857142857
5271966,3,B0095X0120,"My 18 mo old is an Elmo aficionado. This is her least favorite video. There is very little Elmo, just the first few minutes. I like all of the retro clips with BB and Cookie (C is for cookie...) but I bought it for JoJo, not for me. Now, it does have MY favorite Elmo clip...with Elvis Costello singing The Monster Went and Ate My Red 2, but 18 month old JoJo fails to see the irony and retro hipness in this ditty.",1384300800,2,415,4.0120481927710845
5271967,5,B0095X0120,"This DVD is not only my twin daughters favorite, but also my husband and myself. Sesame Street is their hands down favorite, and they have at least a dozen of the DVDs. It's one is better in several ways. First, it's 2 hours long, unlike most videos which are 30 minutes or right under an hour, so that's a great value right there. Second, it goes through every actual Sesame Street character individually, they each get about 10 minutes. It's nice because my girls love Zoe and Snuffleupagus, among others, but it's hard to find videos where they are main characters that also keep their attention. Third, it has new and old clips, so there's actual classic clips from when I used to watch Sesame Street (I'm 31) which is nice instead of just recent clips. In my opinion, if you're looking for a great Sesame Street DVD, this is perfect one for any collection.",1375920000,9,861,4.561290322580645
5271968,4,B0095X0120,"This is a great collection of Sesame Street songs with little mini-clips from a variety of characters. There are a lot of great songs that any kids that watch Sesame Street will love. The only reason for 4 of 5 stars is that some of the characters selected clips are not the best. For instance Groover has some classic ""misadventures"" but no Super Groover or G2.0. Also Rosita does not have very much of her newer selections in Spanish. Maybe one day they will update the selections, add another disc, or Blu Ray to include more selections. Overall great purchase!",1374019200,3,564,4.65
5271969,5,B0095X0120,"The great thing about Sesame Street is that it is designed to play on two levels: As an educational tool, it teaches children about language, math skills, geography and cultural differences (and similarities) with lively songs and colorful characters, but it also does not bore adults by including well-known celebrities and doing clever parodies. While I have no children of my own, I've always enjoyed the music sections.
This DVD collection consists of short skits and songs from pretty much the run of Sesame Street (40 years) and runs just over 2 hours! So there's a lot here. The ""Friends"" in the title refers to the characters on Sesame Street that most children know as their ""friends"" There are 14 ""chapters"" each one devoted to a character from the ever popular Grover and Oscar and Big Bird to the lesser known Snuffy and Rosita. Celebrities abound here (some have appeared in other Sesame Street compilations) like Gloria Estafan, and Elvis Costello. Some were new to me but so much fun. In the Oscar section we have a young (with long hair) James Taylor duetting with Oscar, followed immediately by a young Johnny Cash (NOT wearing black!) harmonizing with Oscar and finally CNN's Anderson Cooper fills in for the missing Oscar.

A bit later Spike Lee directs Big Bird in a film, Little Richard wails with Rosita (substituting her name in the song ""Lucille"") and Lena Horne sings with Grover. It's a lot of fun.

If I have one gripe it is that the DVD is divided into only 14 chapters - as I said, by character - and not each song (of which there are probably 40! This makes it frustrating when, say, you want to find the James Taylor or Elvis Costello song. I'm not sure why they did that. It'll probably frustrate parents too.

But with over 2 hours of material and a fair list price, there's a lot of fun here for young AND old so I'm giving it five stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Unfortunately, my toddler doesn't like this video as much as her others.  I find it boring as well.
