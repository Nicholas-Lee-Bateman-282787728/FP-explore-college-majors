1869166,5,B00008YOD2,"On October 29th 2004, I sat down and watched the film ""Saw"" from the first moment, ti'll the moment the lights came back on. I was captured by it. To me nobody elses opinion really mattered much. It was violent gritty yet under neath it all there was a message that few movies had touched upon. On October 28th 2005. I found myself on the same road going down the same street in the same town to the same movie theatre. My purpose? To see the sequal ""Saw 2"" at first, I wasn't sure what to think, with Donnie Walburg ( ex boy band member) however, as soon as it began. I realized I was in for the same suprise I had when I viewed the first. From the first scene on which involves an updated version of the ""venus fly trap"" head gear and another victim. Our hero played by Donnie is a cop who is losing touch with his son and his own world. After a message from Jigsaw on the ceiling of a victim's death. It becomes apparent, he has a bone to pick with the detective. Soon they return to the place where Jigsaw has watched his victims die/survive for who knows how long. With that, the game begins. Donnie's acting trys a little too hard to be like Bruce willis' style of tough badass cop. He does a GREAT job though. The story is incredible. However, is it better than the first? About equal actually. There is one scene where you see a certain ""something"" or somebody actually, I just don't wanna give the plot away so we'll leave it at that, that may put the second one in the back seat to the first. The ending is nothing short of stunning, my jaw was on the floor. All I have to say is.......The second one ends, where the first began.",1130457600,4,1639,4.189873417721519

1869323,3,B00008YOD2,"I figured i should start reviewing the SAW movies, because i consistently forget which is which, except for the first and last.
This one had the typical saw elements (camera flashes, shaky cam etc) . I should say this first, i adore Tobin bell, i think his acting as Jigsaw is what really sold me on these films to begin with.
This one is a bit flatter, in the series of films. It has a semi-decent plot, but the reliance on camera tricks and ""cringe"" moments is a bit over done (and this is only the second film). I really appreciated the father searching for his son plot, it's very well played out with the traps and gimmicks. However, it's nothing to be completely thrilled with, as the reveals and things fall flat, but it is a good set up for SAW III
Pro's :
Acting
Amanda
Jigsaw
Decent set-up for the next film
Some good ""Traps"" ""Games""

Cons:
It tried a bit too hard
some of the characters felt too generic",1445904000,,914,4.313953488372093

1869325,3,B00008YOD2,"Jigsaw returns in the second film in the Saw franchise and he has created a whole new twist on the haunted house. You could call it the house of pain. In this outing Jigsaw plays a larger role in the bloody festivities, appearing early in the movie and helping to drive the plot to its twisted conclusion.

The story is well written but several holes surface during the course of the movie that stretch the limit of believability. The dialog is still not a strong point with Donnie Whalberg dialing up the angry and phoning in his performance in.

The gore is on full display without beating you over the head. The traps are clever, but they never fully capture the fun of the original. Performances vary, but the a and b list cast of the first movie is replaced with b and c listers that don't carry the weight of the story as easily. Tobin Bell is compelling but his part is not big enough the carry the rest of the cast.

There is fun and entertainment in Saw 2, but weaker writing and a less plausible plot stop this sequel from reaching cult classic status.

I would recommend this movie only to fans of the original. Other viewers might not find the point of all the blood and slightly tired dialogue.",1445558400,,1207,4.3991031390134525

1869386,5,B00008YOD2,Saw is one of the few horror movies out there that always keep the audience interested. This stays true with Saw II. This isn't just your regular horror movie where the main character is running away or trying to run from the killer.,1437868800,,233,4.441860465116279

The same surprise, never would have guessed, ending.  Great acting on the part of Tobin Bell.  And it introduced me to Donnie Wahlberg as a great actor as well which I was totally unaware that he was even into acting.

The story & screenplay by Leigh Whannell (who starred in the original as Adam and also wrote the screenplay to the original) & Darren Lynn Bousman (who also directed) is excellent! The music by Charlie Clouser (who also did the music to the original) is excellent! The cinematography by David A. Armstrong (who also did the cinematography to the original) is great!

The casting by Stephanie Gorin (who also did the casting to ""Godsend"" (2004) & Amy Lippens (who also did the casting to the original ""Saw"" (2004) is great. The production design by David Hackl is great! The art direction by Michele Brady is great! The costume design by Alex Kavanagh (who, most recently, did the costume design to ""George A. Romero's Land Of The Dead"" (2005) is great. This is an impressive follow-up to a horror movie original. This is just as inventive as the original ""Saw"" (2004) was, or is!

Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. Written by Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman.
Second film in the series.

Returning: Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer.

 You should see the first film, SAW (2004), first to understand this second film, however, SAW II (2005) is a great movie to start with too.
 This sequel is an excellent companion piece to the first movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-Blu-ray/dp/B000EWBKLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw [Blu-ray</a>] (2004), and I will not reveal any of the twists and surprises in this movie, but it is another mind blower. In my opinion, SAW II is the best in the film series.
  At the opening of the Twisted Pictures production, we see Michael (Noam Jenkins) wearing an opened iron face mask contraption and he must obey the order of the Jigsaw Killer.  He has only a small amount of time to find the key that will set him free and alive. If he doesn't ""retrieve"" the key, the iron mask will close on his face and kill him.
  Cop, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) must bail out his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from jail. He is tired of dealing with his son's behavior and is so stressed out, he wants him to live somewhere else. Matthews must answer to a call of a homicide. The Jigsaw Killer has struck again. He comes face to face with the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) and Matthews and his team find themselves under timed pressure.
  Eight people are locked in a room somewhere in town. They must find them because Matthew's son is also trapped in that room and time is running out.

  That is just the start of this film. Memorable, shocking scenes you will never forget.
 Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G. really are interesting in this film.  They both give strong performances.

Also in the cast: Noam Jenkins, Ho Chow, Franky G., Emmanuelle Vaugier, Glenn Plummer, Beverly Mitchell, Tony Nappo, Timothy Burd, Lyriq Bent, Kelly Jones, Vincent Rother.

 I wonder if this role by Donnie Wahlberg helped him get noticed for the role of ""Danny Reagan"" in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Bloods-The-First-Season/dp/B003UD7JC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Bloods: The First Season</a>&nbsp;tv series.

 Full Screen Rated ""R"" DVD edition includes informative audio commentary with Director Darren Lynn Bausman and actor Donnie Wahlberg. It can be found in ""Set-Up"".
  Featurettes will show you how all traps were created including the oven and hypodermic needles trap.

The unrated version runs One hour, 35 mins.

 The DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save. Notice the security seals on your container. You will have to peel these or cut them to open the container. I like to leave my seals intact. The DVD itself looks like a saw blade with Jigsaw's face on it.

1869648,4,B00008YOD2,"I was highly skeptical going into this film, but the tight plot, excellent writing and taut suspense completely won me over. If you liked the first Saw, or enjoy crime thrillers with a horror twist... you will like this film.",1331078400,,225,4.65
1869649,4,B00008YOD2,"If you loved ""Saw,"" then you will love ""Saw II."" This is a pretty good sequel that brings us more surprises and twists. Like the first film, ""Saw II"" is smart, intense but gorier and you'll see how cleverly it ties in with the first ""Saw."" Jigsaw is up to his old tricks again. It's a new game with new horrific traps aimed at people who need to be more appreciative of their lives. And there is also another unbelievable ending that you won't see coming.

The movie is based around Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and John Kramer (a.k.a ""Jigsaw"")(Tobin Bell). You get to see a lot more of Jigsaw in this film, and both Whalberg and Bell do a fantastic job with their roles. Detective Matthews is called out by the psychopathic Jigsaw as he investigates a Jigsaw crime scene. Not long after, Matthews and the rest of the police/SWAT team burst into an old building where Jigsaw is practically waiting for them. When confronting Jigsaw, Matthews finds out that he has a huge problem on his hands. Jigsaw has captured his son, along with 7 other people and is holding them in an old abandoned house where they are breathing in a deadly nerve gas. It's Jigsaw's latest game. In three hours, the door to the house will open, but everyone will die within two hours. To avoid death, they must survive the traps around the house and acquire the antidotes hidden within them. But there is also a clue that Jigsaw gives to obtain one of the antidotes locked in a safe; ""You all possess the combination to the safe. Think hard. The numbers are in the back of your mind."" This clue makes for some pretty horrific and intense moments in the film.

All 8 of these people have more in common than they realize. Once you find this out, it's easier to understand why detective Matthews has been thrown into this vicious game to save his son. Jigsaw knows all about who Matthews really is. Yes, basically two games that tie together are going on at the same time. While the 8 people are trying to survive in the house, Matthews must play his own game with Jigsaw right in front of him. All Jigsaw wants is some time to chat with him. If he simply does that, then he will see his son again. For Matthews, it's harder than it seems and the desperation and anger that overcomes him will lead him to another ultimate test along with the haunting answer to the question: ""What is the cure for cancer?""

The characters in the film are all portrayed well. Tobin Bell as the cancer-ridden Jigsaw is calm, cool, collected, yet creepy, sick and twisted. Donnie Wahlberg gives us a tough, angry, desperate cop in Eric Matthews. He does a great job and his emotion is clearly felt. Matthews' son Daniel (played by Erik Knudsen) comes off as a hard-ass at the start of the movie, yet when kidnapped, turns into a somewhat innocent, emotional kid in the face of the others. Shawnee Smith is back as Amanda, which was a nice twist to the film. She is an essential character to the movie and we get to see a lot more background on this infamous Jigsaw trap survivor from the first film. One of the best characters in the movie who gets the horror flowing nicely in the abandoned house is Xavier (Frankie G.). He's a big, self-centered, muscular tough guy who shows viciously how far he will go to save himself. He pulls out all the stops toward the end of the film and is involved in my favorite scene from the movie pertaining to the number on the back of his neck. Then there's Obi (Timothy Burd), an interesting character who played a pivotal role in why they're all in the house. His role is small, but very memorable. Glenn Plummer plays Jonas, one of the more rational members of the group. All the characters compliment themselves nicely in the movie; a good solid cast.

The traps of course, help make the movie. The film opens with my personal favorite. A man named Michael; a snitch/informant wears a Venus flytrap-style death mask that will close up around him unless he retrieves the key from in his eye socket and unlocks it. It's a perfect grisly intro that gives you the impression that ""yes, there will be blood."" Besides the gas house trap itself that makes everyone go crazy, you'll also see the gun-in-the-peephole trap, the syringe pit, the oven fire trap and the blood-soaked wrist-cutting trap. There's even a trap ready for the SWAT team who dash into the old building where Jigsaw is during the first part of the movie. One guy gets his legs broken and sparks fly everywhere.

""Saw II"" is a bit more fast-paced than the original, and though I like the original a little better, this sequel still delivers. Writer/Director Darren Lynn Bousman does a great job, and Leigh Whannell (writer and actor in the first Saw) came back to help write this sequel and does a fantastic job. If you've seen the first ""Saw,"" you must see this one. Bloody and suspenseful, this is a horror movie that will have you wondering what will happen next throughout the film. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.",1329004800,,4992,4.5360710321864595

However, Saw II was an awesome display of exploring the life and ill-fated life of John Kramer. While at the same time making an officer understand the pain he has caused to others; including his own son. Seeing Amanda return was a surprise as she was put back into another game, but all was revealed towards the end. Saw II was a great sequel to an awesome franchise.

1869682,4,B00008YOD2,"After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.

A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.

Saw TWO begins with EIGHT people trapped in an abandoned NERVE GAS HOUSE.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer) game, XAVIER CHAVEZ (Frankie G.), GUS COLYARD (Tony Nappo), and OBI TATE (Tim Burd), among others, have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. ERIC MATTHEWS (Donnie Wahlberg) are investigating as a team, but ERIC MATTHEWS may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that OBI may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.

Several murderous contraptions like the MAGNUM EYE HOLE (for a MONEY LAUNDERER), the FURNACE TRAP (for a CONMAN), and the NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK (for a DRUG DEALER who tosses in a JUNKIE) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene VENUS FLY TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S ACCOMPLICES, and on to Saw III.

but this film is a biggest failure in all series

btw  the plot was written for a scary movie

but IGN took it in",1292284800,2,247,4.148936170212766
1869684,3,B00008YOD2,"Saw II started life with a number of disadvantages. The originality of Saw pretty much guarantees that Saw II will be a letdown, if only because the most interesting twists have already been run. We know why Jigsaw does what he does. Even the twist ending isn't much of a twist, given the first one. Working out the connections between the players in his game is easier and less surprising because we're expecting connections.

The connections are many, and new ones abound. Almost all of the players (with the exception of the detective father of one of the hostages) have been placed in a sealed house. They must solve a series of puzzles to survive, each one highlighting the sins of one or another of the victims. A room filled with dirty syringes faces an addict who spends her days shooting up with similar paraphenalia. The hot-head control freak must learn to resist the obvious red herrings.

As hard as it would be to follow Saw, the fault lies with the filmmakers, too (their first mistake being trying to make a sequel, one that the director of the first movie, James Wan, didn't make). The puzzles are more interesting than the characters, and solving them is more the focus than the horrors they reveal. The first Saw forced us closer and closer to the characters, each secret revealed making our own sins more and more apparent. We were voyeurs looking in the mirror, to paraphrase Jigsaw. But here we are distanced from the victims; they're easy to dislike and dismiss--which would put us directly in Jigsaw's sights, but we don't really care because we really don't feel that they are us.

It was a mistake, too, to give Jigsaw so much camera time. The more we see, the less mysterious and menacing he becomes. In the original, Jigsaw was a god-like enigma; in Saw II, he comes off as more sadistic and petty than profound and powerful.",1288051200,,1853,4.660550458715596
1869685,5,B00008YOD2,to me this is the only good saw movie to me. This had the most horror elements that made most horror movies  in the 80' and 90's.,1288051200,,129,3.7777777777777777
1869686,5,B00008YOD2,"""Saw 2"" is the 2005 sequel to the original ""Saw"" movie and has become the most financially successful ""Saw"" film in history. The movie pretty much follows the pattern of the first as people are kidnapped by the evil Jigsaw, in which he attempts to teach them not to take life for granted, albeit performed in a most inhumane and distorted way. There is blood, gore, yelling, screaming, and many plot twists that make ""Saw 2"" a worthy film to watch if your in the mood to be scared. In this movie a police officer's son is kidnapped by Jigsaw and it is heartbreaking to see the lengths in which a parent will go to save their son.
 Other sequels follwed ""Saw 2"" and most were huge boxoffice, but this and the original are the best in the ""Saw"" franchise. It seems that after the first two the plots became mundane and repetitive and 2009's version of ""Saw"", the last so far in the ""Saw"" films, was a boxoffice flop signalling perhaps the audience is tiring of Jigsaw and his demented actions.",1273104000,,991,4.445054945054945
1869687,3,B00008YOD2,"Saw 2 is not quite as good as the first one but it still does a pretty good job of pulling its own weight. Once again the ending is very unpredictable. The death traps are as good as ever, but it does not have the original taste that the first Saw movie has, but still a very entertaining movie to watch.",1271808000,,304,4.0

Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it.",1268784000,3,544,3.9545454545454546
1869689,4,B00008YOD2,"Is this sequel a worthy successor to the original Saw? Well, it's a bit of a step down in the series for a couple of reasons. First, half of Jigsaw's victims are just plain annoying. You've got your typical dumb and whiny chicks, and your typical arrogant jerk. You even got a young teenager, who is probably the most annoying one out of all of them. And he doesn't even talk that much! Second, this film also has your standard detective plot thread. Jigsaw is typically found and interrogated (like you've never seen THAT before in the detective genre), and the detectives themselves look like obvious cardboard cutouts. The good news is those are the only flaws I can find in this film, I think. The traps are far more inventive than the ones in the original, and while they didn't freak me out, they are still disturbing to look at. We get to know a little more about Jigsaw and why he makes his victims play his little ""games."" He's probably one of the creepiest villains in the horror genre.

If you loved the first Saw, then you would probably love this one as well if you don't mind the flaws. I enjoyed watching it myself, and it was enough for me to have interest in the next sequel.

1869690,5,B00008YOD2,"I bought this originally for my boyfriend for Christmas, and as a big Saw fan, he definitely enjoyed it. As with any video product, it's only fair to comment on the quality of the product, not the content, and we have thoroughly enjoyed the high definition quality and numerous features that are included in this Blu-ray!",1265760000,,321,4.75
1869691,4,B00008YOD2,"When the first one ended, I was positive the series was gonna be good. Plus the back story on Jigsaw was a nice touch. Seeing someone learning to help him with his work was a nice one too. Other than that I don't have much else to say about this one, mostly good things if I did though.

August 8, 2010) I recently watched/purchased the two disc special edition-I wish they would've stuck with the clear case/dust cover with these first two films of the 2-disc. The storyline is pretty good-Donnie Wahlberg is a cop and father to a son who no longer understand each other. But when his son is thrust into a Jigsaw game-he is forced to change his tone. In the process he meets Jigsaw/Tobin Bell-you get a glimpse of his past and how he became so demented-the further chapters elaborate on this perfectly as well.
The 2-disc is better than the one disc because of the special features-making of featurettes, commentaries, and a few other odds and ends. The first trap in this one made me cringe-what the subject had to do was freaky. The twist at the end was wild just like the first SAW. Which edition do I recommend? Personally, if you like the Saw series like I do, you'll want to get both the clear case and 2-disc of both the first two films, at least. The uncut edition didn't change much here either, except a couple very subtle, and I do mean subtle changes when the swat team infiltrates Jigsaw's lair, that scene was slightly changed, other than that, I didn't see much different.
If I could grade this film, I'd give it an A-",1265068800,,1534,4.420494699646643
1869729,3,B00008YOD2,"This isn't so much a review of the ""Saw"" series itself as it is my gripe about the franchise release on Blu Ray disc.  When I first got into the series, I bought the DVDs, only to see a subsequent ""unrated cut"" released shortly thereafter and even, in some cases (as was with ""Saw III""), a ""director's cut."" Being the fan that I am, yes, I bought whatever newer version came out and took the older versions to the used CD stores... What is the studio waiting for with regards to ""Saw: Uncut Edition,"" ""Saw II: Special Edition,"" and ""Saw III: Director's Cut""?  Enough is enough! My all-time favorite movie trilogy is ""The Lord of the Rings,"" but as tempted as I am to get the upcoming Blu Ray release (as I know it will be visually stunning), I refuse to shell out one dime until the extended editions make it to Blu Ray. The same applies to the ""Saw"" series and any other franchise.",1263600000,,882,4.33939393939394
1869730,5,B00008YOD2,"After seeing the first SAW movie and being blown away, I didn't think it was possible to make a sequal that will be even half as good as the original! Boy was I wrong! In this movie you will get to know the the Jigsaw character (Played by the brilliant Tobin Bell) even more and see what motivates him to put people in those sick and twisted games. Infact to me, the best part of the movie is when Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg are in diolog togehter. It really gets you thinking and in a way justifies what Jigsaw does. It hits every level, from taking life for granted to forgiving everyones wrong doing when faced with death, just pure brilliance! Wahlbergs performance as Eric Matthews is also extremly good! The superior wahlberg brother in my own opinion! The traps are great and the story it self is engaging and smart. Saw movies are not just about mindless killing like other horror movies. It's a smart film and has a twist in the end that will shock you as much as the first film did. I suggest seeing the original before seeing this sequal if you haven't already. There are a few problems with this bluray release though. The HD quality seems to dip from HD to standerd quality from scene to scene. It does not happening all the time but it is noticable and a bit irritating. Other than that the film looks great, and has a decent amount of extras to keep you entertained after the movie. I just wish the HD dipps didn't happend at all. Over all though this is one of the best in the series and higly recomend it!",1261612800,2,1526,4.339160839160839
1869731,4,B00008YOD2,"This movie had a lot going for it. It also had a lot to live up to. It still had the feel and suspense of the first one. I wish they would have kept Jigsaw in the shadows more. Some of the suspense of the character was taken away from all of the screen time. This movie didn't have the individualized traps like the first one. The group had to take on the challenges together. It was still a good movie, but it didn't have the same amount of intensity the first one did. It tried to create it by using the nerve gas as a ticking time bomb, but the feel of this movie is just not up to the scope of the first one. I didn't care for Doonie Wahlberg's character. He seemed like a jerk, not as good of a character as Detective Tapp in the first one. There's no outside force on these characters like the first one. There is the nerve gas, but you never know how much time they have left. The characters aren't as developed, and they don't seem to grow as the movie unfolds. There are a few interesting traps, but they seem to hate each other instead of Jigsaw. The ending was a little predictable, unlike the first. The addition of the assistant is not my favorite, but it doesn't hurt this movie, it does hurt the movies that follow. Overall a nice sequel, unfortunately the movies will only decline from here.",1259539200,,1307,4.211155378486056
1869732,4,B00008YOD2,"When it comes to filming sequels there's a strong tendency to proceed with the philosophy ""more is better"". More gore, more special effects, more characters in jeopardy, etc... In doing so one takes the risk of losing that intangible element that made the first film a success. Well the film 'Saw II' did just that, more of everything. But you know what? It worked beautifully!

'Saw II' was successful in taking all the successful elements from the first film; expanding the cast, improving the effects, intensifying the psychological angst and physical gore while maintaining a strong narrative continuity with the original movie. Even more impressive was the manner in which they were able to have so many new things going on and still add psychological depth and breath to an already great protagonist (Jigsaw played by Tobin Bell).

There are a lot of clever and unexpected twists and turns in this one that really leave an already strong storyline up to many more sequels to come!

This time around, the cast is larger, and that means more traps. More traps is a good thing. Some of them are cringe-worthy. There is a hemorrhagic flu that all the players have been injected with and the main plot involves finding antidotes. There is a subplot involving Donnie Wahlberg as a brutish cop who is also being tested by Jigsaw. We see Jigsaw's lair. Amanda returns.

1869762,5,B00008YOD2,"Following where the original started, ""Saw 2"" is an excellent follow-up to the smash hit that started the franchise. And like the original, this movie manages to blend its police-story crime elements with the suspense of a thriller and the tension and graphic content of horror.
By now, Jigsaw is taken into custody and being interviewed by the police, all while a new group of his victims are locked in a house and must find a way out before time runs out and they meet their death. Sounds interesting, right? Well if it sounds good, seeing it will take it to another level entirely, as the dirty fingers and chipped nails on the front cover suggest.
In comparison to the first ""Saw"", this movie is more graphic, gory and twisted. The small fire chamber, the needle pit and the wrist-cutting puzzle box all make up some gruesome scenes that really show you what a great horror movie can do. I'm sure at least one of those scenes, or others, will have you squirming! For me personally, it was the fire chamber scene that left me shuddering.
Also, while the original ""Saw"" had a great, dirty look to it, especially something in the use of the camerawork, this one takes it up again! While the original did have a gritty, raw feel to it, as opposed to polished camerawork of say, a foreign horror film, ""Saw 2"" gives the original a run for its money in that field.
In ""Saw 2"", the camerawork gets even rawer and grittier, giving it the shaky feel you may see when you're in a nightmare. There are some moments where, dare I say, it almost has a psuedo-snuff feel to it, much like the underground film series ""August Underground"". Dear Lord, I'll save that for another day!
But anyway, ""Saw 2"" is still able to find a genius balance between a smart police story and a gritty torture-thriller display. I really give the writers of this film credit, because not too many films can have that dual-personality medium and pull it off so well.
Well, that about wraps up this review. If you wanna watch ""Saw 2"", I might recommend you watch the original ""Saw"" before, just so you can understand what's going on. Hey, make it a double feature! Anyway, if you liked the original, or want to watch a ""Saw"" film, you'll love this! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1228521600,,2247,4.523341523341523

After bailing his son out, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is.

1869766,4,B00008YOD2,"Saw 2 is a sequal that worked for the most part in my opinion.  It stays true to the Saw theme by still asking if you are grateful to be alive, and asking how much blood you are willing to shed to stay alive once you are in a life or death situation (or game, as Jigsaw calls it).  The games (or traps some may like to call them too) are more played out in this sequal, where as we only got to see glimpses in the first Saw.  The main scenario is on a larger scale, played out in an old house with a group of people, as compared to the two men in a large bathroom in the first movie.  A nice connection is made with the first movie (in addition to story elements) which brings some of the people into the same bathroom once again near the movie's end.  There is also that unexpected surprise to the story that made probably the biggest impact (in my opinion) with the first Saw.  Again, you couldn't quite see this one coming either, but it didn't have quite the satisfying and felt impact as the first Saw.

Tobin Bell is Jigsaw, and gets a lot more screen time in Saw 2, we even actually see his face quite a bit.  More light is shed about who he is, where he's come from, and why he does what he does with these sick little games.  The man has a point, but the scenarios he creates are so brutal its nearly impossible to see it as fear and panic take over.  This is the case with detective Mathews (Donnie Whalberg) who is the main character in Saw 2, and whom the main game's focus is around.  You got a house full of young men and woman (including Mathews son) trying to stay alive, playing one brutal game after another, but the bigger picture is Mathews and the game he is playing right in front of Jigsaw.  The rules are laid out for Mathews, but they are so wrapped up in the fear and panic that it is impossible for him to see and that's when things begin to unfold and the surprise ending is told.

While disturbing and difficult to watch at times, Saw 2 doesn't have quite the impact as the original.  There is plenty of blood, gore and violence, and one of the guys named Xavier (Franky G) becomes the scariest guy in the movie when he is driven to do whatever he feels he must to stay alive in that house.  There are more traps and possible the most frightening was the very first of the movie, even before things get rolling we see a man who has had the key to unlocking his trap surgically inserted under his eye.  He has 60 seconds to dig it out with a little knife.  Not a very bloody scene at all, but just the thought of what must be done to survive is gut wrenching enough.  On a good note, things move along in Saw 2, going from one trap/test to the next, while the first Saw was a bit more laid back, with the two men in the bathroom talking things out in grave details and referring to flashbacks to piece the puzzle together, however I believe it was those moments that created more tension and fright when the bloodshed and panic occured, resulting in more of a felt impact in regard to those in Saw 2.

Saw 2 works for what it is, by carrying on the Saw theme, expanding on the scenarios (and some gore if that's your thing) and exploring Jigsaw's background a little more.  I don't think it's quite as sharp as the original, but it improves in various areas and falls in others.

1869767,3,B00008YOD2,"This second installment of the Saw series is by far the worst of the bunch.  Sequels are always a bad idea, especially when you're up against something as brilliant as the original Saw.  Let's face it.  This is a premise with severely limited room for expansion.  The first Saw was a beautifully wretched and gruesome concept that was played out great on film.  But this sequel didn't have much of a chance of matching the sweet bloody ambiance of its pedecessor.  Like most sequels, since the premise of the movie was explained during the plot of the original flick, the writers don't feel the need to weigh down part II with a storyline.  They just set the villian out in public again and have him wreek havoc and spill more blood with greater special effects than the first.  And as always, it makes the sequel an insult to the original and a basic disappointment.  They didn't even try to stand up to the original with this movie.  The plot about all the people locked in a house with nerve gas was just so weak and contrived!!  What was Lee W. thinking when he did this???  It was an okay movie over all.  Blood, carnage and special effects are always fun to a point...but for the most part, this movie was the average expectation of a sequel...trying too hard to live off the name of the original, not bothering with a movie as long as we can depend on special effects.  They really rushed through making a sequel before they had a real movie in mind.  As much as I love carnage, I hate the obvious cheap capitalism displayed in this quick knock-off.  If you like gratuitous violence and blood, this flick has a certain charm........but don't expect this to be as good as Saw.",1216684800,2,1682,4.483552631578948

1869801,3,B00008YOD2,"After amassing an excellent box office return with the smash horror hit ""Saw"" in 2004, Lionsgate Films released the inevitable sequel ""Saw 2"" just one year later in hopes of maximizing their returns by riding the coattails of the first film's success. With a mostly new cast consisting of fairly talented, yet not so well known actors, such as, Donnie Wahlberg (""Ransom""), Emmanuelle Vaugier (TV's ""Smallville""), and Beverly Mitchell (TV's ""7th Heaven"") acting alongside returning members from the first film, Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, I for one was unsure whether this would be a horror sequel worthy of being watched or yet another inferior sequel in a line that is far too long to begin with.

""Saw 2"" picks up shortly after the events of the first film, as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the madman from the first movie has returned with a new set of games to play and traps to set. When Jigsaw's newest victim is purposely left in the open to be discovered by the police, lead detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) traces the crime back to its perpetrator with relative ease. With Jigsaw being caught, what would seem to most people to be a massive set back to his plans, is merely just another aspect of the game that he has carefully set into motion. As the detectives desperately try to break Jigsaw, eight new victims are trapped and fighting for their very lives. With time running out the choice faced by all involved can easily be summed up by Jigsaw's cryptic motto, ""Live or die, make your choice.""

Here's the thing with ""Saw 2"", it's kind of a mixed bag in terms of my take on the movie. On one hand I thought it was a very solid, and in some ways surprising follow up film to one of the most original horror films I had ever seen. On the other hand, certain aspects to the film felt somewhat standard and by the book, and featured characters that were not nearly as interesting as those in the first film.

I thought that as far as the story for this installment goes it was just as interesting, and even a little more in depth than the first one. This chapter in the 'Saw' saga gave viewers more of an insight into what pushes Jigsaw to do what he does and how he rationalizes it all. This element of the story was surprising because I expected it to make me feel somewhat sorry for him, which I would not have liked at all, but instead it makes you realize just how extremely disturbed he truly is, because his reasons are purely insane. This approach was a surprise for me, and one that I appreciated from the writers (Leigh Whannell and Darren Lynn Bousman) because they opted not to attempt to gain sympathy from the audience towards Jigsaw, but instead chose to show him as a normal human being at one point in his life, who snaps and begins this insane quest to teach others to appreciate life. What a novel concept for a writer to try, for once lets try to keep the villain despicable throughout the series, rather than make him a likable guy who is just misunderstood or has been led astray.

The cast, as I stated earlier, is not as well known as the first film's, but is still decent all the same. Donnie Wahlberg is a better lead than Cary Elwes, and his character was far more interesting due to his somewhat corrupt nature, and his link to the eight victims trapped by Jigsaw made for interesting drama as the plot unfolded. The various members of the cast that comprised the eight trapped characters were adequate; some of them gave solid, believable performances, while others just gave audiences typical horror movie throwaway characters that the audience could care less about. Tobin Bell was featured much more heavily in this film than he had in the previous, and he is allowed to give more depth to Jigsaw this time around, and he does a wonderful job of portraying the two time periods of the character's life that are depicted in the film. In the flashbacks we see him when he was known simply as John, a normal man who is given horrible news, the fact that he has cancer. This news shakes him to his very core, and serves as the catalyst to his downward spiral into insanity. Then we see him throughout the rest of the movie as the evil, manipulative Jigsaw; the way Tobin plays the two sides of the same person so drastically different is a great showcase of his acting talent.

The biggest problem I had with ""Saw 2"" was the fact that some of the characters featured in this movie were just flat-out unlikable, and yet these were the ones we should have been rooting for to survive to the end of the film. However, for many of them I didn't really care if they succumbed to Jigsaw's maniacal plans. Now, I'm well aware that some of the eight soon-to-be victims were designed to be as unlikable as possible, but to me for a horror movie to truly work, each and every character that is being pursued by the killer should have at least some redeeming qualities so the audience can feel some sense of loss when they are killed by the killer, this isn't the case with ""Saw 2"". At least half of the eight people trapped are some form of despicable criminal, who I felt deserved punishment, maybe not the kind as severe as Jigsaw had set, but I still didn't feel too bad when their time came. What made the first film work somewhat better than this one was that the characters, though flawed, were still likable and people the audience could root for to survive through to the end. If ""Saw 2"" would have taken this approach a little more then the movie would have been just as good as the first.

The traps, which are the focus of this series of films, are just as innovative and original as the first one. But, some of the setups for the traps relied heavily on the characters being stupid enough to fall for them, which of course they did. Where the first one had the traps being forced upon the victims, this one seemed like each trap being sprung was purely coincidence, that there wasn't as much planning on Jigsaw's part to force the character's to fall prey to his deadly machinations. ""Saw 2"" also used the traps to focus more on bloodshed and gore than the first film did, where the director of the original movie, James Wan (who opted not to return for some reason), didn't rely on as much gore to scare the audience, the new director Darren Lynn Bousman (who also co-wrote the film) went for less of an eerie atmosphere and more for blood and gore, which is the more typical horror movie route, and also served to bring this installment down some by not being as original.

""Saw 2"" is an effective sequel to one of the most original horror movies of all time. However, a little too much reliance on convenience in places, along with too many unlikable characters denied this movie from meeting the standards set forth by the first film. Even though I have more gripes with this installment than I did the first one, it is still a superior horror movie compared to most horror sequels or just horror films in general that are released these days.

1869804,5,B00008YOD2,"The saw trilogy is a continuos story. When they wrote saw, I am sure they did not have trilogy in mind. Infact saw was not even intended for mainstream theatre release when it was in it's initial project stage. The success of saw :-) saw to it that 2 and 3 came out. The success is due to the originality of the story, the plotting, the ingenious wretched instruments of torture/death and the gore. I  have not seen gore of such a raw nature in any other movie. It is clinical and methodical gore'n'guts. saw 2 is the best of the 3 (I haven't seen 4 yet).

Traps include: death mask aka venus head trap; needle pit;wrist slasher;body oven, peep hole eye pistol.

Extras on dvd is pretty cool. There is the ""the traps of Jigsaw"" which shows every trap from story board, production design and sfx level. And there is also a director's audio commentary.

There is a ""making of"". You'll be better off renting this one. I don't think you want to be watching this one every week else you'll end up with insomnia.

This one is more psychological and the torture traps/rigs are awesome. The SFX team a cool job. Just watch the movie for what it is. If you are squeamish about blood and gore, you won't be renting this one out anyway. The Critics on many sites have panned the whole saw series. I think it's unfair to judge the movie as bad from the angle that there is too much gore. you have to first be a fan of the genre and then judge it within the genre of blood'n'guts films. Thing is saw is so cutting edge, new age and barrier breaking that I don't think there's been a movie like saw. The images are pretty gruesome and not for the faint heartened. saw2 has a cool ending. I won't say more than that. This movie brings together a group of ppl caught in a house. 2 leads the movie into 3. Its almost 2 episodes. 3 can't be seen without seeing 2 first else you will get totally confused. Same with 2. If you haven't seen 1 don't see this one. The set from saw 1 is back: the famous toilet set with the infamous ankle piece has been left over (cut in saw1 to escape from the leg chain) features here. ""Ohh yes there will be blood"" he said.

1869806,2,B00008YOD2,"I was excited about this film, truly excited.  I really enjoyed the first `Saw' film and just had the highest of hopes for the sequel.  I think that's why in the end it proved to be such a disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, when I walked out of the theater I was in heaven.  I loved what I had just seen.  It was gruesome, disturbing and to an extent quite scary.  After a second watch through though I realized that this film is so far below the original it's ridiculous.  The concept for this film is just too simple when compared to the original film.  The only similarity between the two is the villain and even that takes an unwarranted twist.  Yes, the final sequence was a head-scratcher but it couldn't hold a candle to the mastery that was the original `Saw' conclusion.

The film centers again around mastermind Jigsaw as he sets up yet another elaborate trap, this time collecting a group of ex-convicts in an abandoned house filled with deadly gas with antidotes spread throughout the house.  In order for them to get these antidotes they must do some horrific things.  One of the victims is young Daniel Matthews whose father, Police Detective Eric Matthews, has captured Jigsaw and is trying desperately (and quite uncivilly) to force into giving up the houses location.

Sadly `Saw II' becomes a showcase for gruesome deaths and disturbing sights over mental breakdown and mind bending horror.  I say `sadly' for a reason.  The original `Saw' was not all that gory.  Sure there were some bloody sequences and some disturbing events but for the most part `Saw' was a mental game, a mind tease if you will.  `Saw II' feels like a cop out almost.  It feels like any other slasher film and that is a disappointment since I expected so much more.

There are some good things about this film, Tobin Bell for one who expands upon his original role as Jigsaw with some exceptional results, but story wise `Saw II' fails.  As far as the death scenes are concerned, sure they make you squirm and that's a plus right, and that pit of syringes still gets to me when I think about it, but all of this can't make up for the lack or originality.  It's dark, it's disturbing, it's gory and it's very uninspired.  I have yet to see the third and fourth `Saw' offerings mainly because this was such a let down.  I'm sure I'll get to the rest of the series to form my own opinions; hopefully they will be an improvement.

The acting here is an improvement upon the original, well, at least some of it is.  Donnie Wahlberg (who could be brother Mark's twin I swear) has a much better grasp on his character than Cary Elwes did.  Shawnee Smith does decently here as does Erik Knudsen and of course Tobin Bell.  The rest of the cast is decent at best.  Franky G is horrific, Beverley Mitchell (from `Seventh Heaven'...what's she doing here?) is annoying as all get out and Tim Burd is just plain non-effective.  Emmanuelle Vaugier does little else but be really hot and Tony Nappo is gone too quickly to make much of an impact so that leaves Glenn Plummer to pick up the pieces and he does a decent but not too impressive a job.  Still, the acting is an improvement if you will.

In the end I can't say much else then this was a major disappointment when compared to what it could have been but when you place it in the perspective of `most' (I say `most' because there are a select few horror films that truly are brilliant) horror films of late then this fits in the with pack as disturbing, gruesome and brainless.",1194566400,2,3512,4.4834645669291335
1869807,2,B00008YOD2,"Being that it is Halloween I have decided to check out a few horror films, and since I already watched the first ""Saw"", I thought that I could continue on with the series, because the first one showed a lot of potential in the series. Unfortunatly ""Saw II"" did not continue to give me faith in the series.

Saw 1 started out with 2 guys trapped in a room, and we followed thier back story to find out why they were there. The problem was interesting, and although it did not follow up on its true potential, it was interesting. The idea of a Killer, who never actually kills anybody, but makes them kill themselves was new and interesting, ""Saw II"" Forgot that.

""Saw II"" Had about 8 or so people trapped in a house that is pumping a nerve gas into thier system, that if ingested for more than 2 hours would cause them to die. Throughout the house thier are traps and puzzles set up, that if done right will allow them to get an antidote to the gas, each trap set for an individual, for the crimes they have done to humanity, or themselves so that if they do survive they can better understand life.

Meanwhile the father of one of the people in the house (who happens to be a cop) has actually caught Jigsaw, but things are not working out when Jigsaw shows him what is going on with his son.

This sounds like it might be a fun movie. But its not. I don't care if there is an antidote somewhere in the house, if they don't know how to get it, and you pumped them full of poisin, THAT'S STILL MURDER. Also while the first one had many new ideas, this one is painfully pumped full of horror movie cliche's, that I am so damn sick of seeing. Like the survivor from the previous film, who because she survived him once before she is an expert on him. The tough guy jerk who doesn't care about saving anybody but himself. Their is no character development, just big walking stereotypes we have seen in every horror movie ever made. Oh, and I hate to give it away, but the black guy dies.

Just like the original ""Saw"" it failed to live up to its own potential that it set up. We are led to believe that there are several traps throughout the house, each for an individual person. 8 people, we see 3, and one of them it isn't even explained who it was for. The ending for the most part was predictable. and again, nobody seems to care too much about the time limit until it is too late. They people have 2 hours and they open like 3 rooms in the house. I pretty sure they would have gotten a lot more done if the time limit was used to its potential.

And in the end, you find out that most of what transpired in that movie, did not matter, that really, this is all just a huge set up for ""Saw III"".  I don't like when movies waste my time just so they can get another movie in the series. I will see ""Saw III"" because I have MVP at Hollywood Video, so its free and I can let my curiousity get the best of me, but I would not pay to continue this series.

1869829,3,B00008YOD2,"I loved the suspense of the first ""Saw"" and was thrilled with it being more intent on keeping you guessing what would happen next, rather than spending the whole time hacking people up. The first movie was quite clever and the game and puzzles made sense. I even told friends and family it wasn't that gory, and it really wasn't. It was a true thriller. This movie on the other hand was more like all the other gorefest schlock. Afterall we start with not two people playing the game but no less than eight. Okay to get the ball rolling we first got to see a snitch have his head spiked by a mask before we find our group of victims in their cell.  Then right off without any delay or game drama we get to see one shot in the eye and his brains blown out. Not much longer we see another get burned up.

All-in-all a bit of a disappointment from the first movie. Granted I never expected it to be as good as the first one, I just hoped it would follow the line of suspense over gore. It didn't. It joined the countless number of hack and slash movies with little story and lots of blood. Oh golly we get to see ""Jigsaw"" pass the sawblade to another. Such a thrill. NOT! Why did I give it three stars? It still has reasonably good acting, and some semblance of a story. So if you can stomach substancially more gore than the first movie, by all means rent it.

1869836,4,B00008YOD2,"Although the ""Saw"" series is billed as horror, it's more accurately described as torture porn with at least half a brain.  There's very little in any of the movies that can be called scary, but there is a lot of screaming, a lot of blood, and a lot of clever deaths.  Obviously there are folks who like that sort of thing, and who are willing to suspend a lot of disbelief in order to enjoy it.

The pale and pendulous Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw for this second installment with a brand-new velvet cape and a much meatier role.  He's still riddled with cancer, weaker than ever, but still capable of designing and building complex doomsday devices that appear inspired by equal parts Edward Gorey and Rube Goldberg.  Also, the man seems to have some serious connections in both real estate (how many houses does this guy own?) and toxic gas.

Said gas is lethal but takes an hour to work its deadly magic (more or less).  It is being pumped into a multiply booby-trapped house in which eight people are trapped, told via Jigsaw's ponderous voice that antidotes to the nerve agent can be found by enduring a series of tests.  Meanwhile, Jigsaw plays a more personal game with a cop (Donnie Wahlberg), whose son, Daniel, is one of the prisoners in the Mansion O' Macabre.

Tobin shows enough restraint to make Jigsaw a sympathetically evil man, but the other actors don't fare quite as well.  This is in keeping with the first film, which cared less about proper acting than it did about its harsh, flourescent stage.  The people in the house scream and fight and utter silly dialogue.  Donnie Wahlberg moans and emotes for his son.  Jigsaw parcels out his trademark bon mots about life, and preciousness, and how much better water tastes when you're about to die.

I'm not going to test his theory.  I suspect it might be true, but that's not really the point of the movie, no matter how much Jigsaw tries to cram it down our throats.  The point is, obviously, the games that Jigsaw sets up.  In that sense, this sequel is actually better than the original; it's no more or less frightening, but it is much smarter, and it moves with a well-oiled precision.  The ""Saw"" movies, with their elaborate endgames and their gritty platitudes, will never really scare viewers, but they do give the prurient and the voyeuristic something raw and meaty to chew on.  In a world where it's vastly more entertaining to watch someone lose than it is to watch them win, that means bad news for Jigsaw's victims, but good news for ""Saw II.""",1184716800,2,2525,4.595982142857143
1869837,5,B00008YOD2,"To be completely honest, I had VERY low expectations for Saw 2. I had watched the first film, and LOVED it. I loved how James Wan and Leigh Whannell were able to create such a creepy film with such a simple set. I loved the brilliant psychological warfare between two individuals who start out calm but grow angry with each other soon after. I loved the flashback sequences. Truth be told, I loved everything about it, and I was upset to then learn of three sequels (and probably a fourth) to such a classic horror film.

But anyway, since I had loved the first so much, one day I found myself at Blockbuster and decided to give the sequel a chance. I had nothing else to do. I could barely speak after watching it. I had just walked out of my home theater room with the memory of one of the best and most well-made sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

""Saw 2,"" quite simply, is basically the first film on steroids. From the very first scene (which, by the way, was so revolting I had to set my giant movie theater butter popcorn bowl on the table next to me) Saw 2 will take your hands and lead you into a world of nightmare that you can't escape from until the end credits arrive on your screen 90 minutes later.

The story is simple to follow yet complex to dive into. Jigsaw locks eight people in a house full of traps, and they have two hours to find a way out before a lethal nerve gas flowing through the house kills them like the EBOLA virus. Meanwhile, Detective Matthews, a cop, apprehends Jigsaw with a team. And, it just so happens, one of the eight trapped in that house is Eric Matthews' son.

Saw 2 has everything the first film had and beyond. The gore is up there as a 9 or 10 on the gore scale, while I'd give the first film maybe a 7. Remember the psychological warfare that ensued between Adam and Lawrence in the first film? Well, it's magnified 100x in ""Saw 2,"" between Jigsaw and Detective Matthews, and the eight unlucky individuals trapped inside the house. The acting is incredibly top-rate and soars past the first film in acting talent. Everyone in the cast does a GREAT job and makes the film seem that much more realistic. The direction and editing is superb (better than the first) and we now seriously know Leigh Whannell can seriously write a damn good movie, even though the screenplay for the first film was better. Apart from that, the only complaints I could have for ""Saw 2"" is that it isn't as creative or inventive as the first was, but who says it has to be? It's a sequel--it is merely carrying on the story where the first left off. The second complaint would be that it isn't scary...at all. It's just a brilliant suspense film that will have you cringe in disgust at the deliciously cleverly twisted film before your eyes. And for me, that's enough.

The twist at the end is also one of the biggest shockers I've ever witnessed watching a film. You think the one at the end of ""Saw 1"" is big? You ain't seen nothing yet. And go ahead--keep trying to guess the ending throughout watching ""Saw 2."" I guarantee you it'll go in the exact opposite direction of what you're thinking of.

Overall--do what your love for the first film tells you to do. See ""Saw 2,"" disregard your thoughts of how a sequel could never be as great as the first, sit down, and put this movie on. You won't be disappointed! My only worry now is the third film possibly living up to the caliber of the first two. Leigh Whannell and James Wan prove that ""Saw"" is not one horror film saga for recent years, it's one for the century.",1183852800,3,3559,4.352409638554217
1869838,5,B00008YOD2,"The film has shock value, suspense, gore and realism.  I didn't have very high expectations for this film thinking it would be a typical slasher flick, but it really surprised me.  I haven't been watching many horror films lately.  Maybe there are quite a few good ones being made.  Saw II definately delivers.

The film's plot has nothing to do with saws and I have not seen Saw I.  Any horror film that gets me thinking is a good film and well worth the price of rental or maybe even purchasing for horror film enthusiasts.  The main thing I got out of the film is that we all tend to conjure up  our own realities and this can make or break us.",1183852800,8,647,4.245901639344262

Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) discovers Jigsaw himself for he must play the game if his son and the other victims can survive.

Enjoyable and fairly grisly sequel to the suprise instant new horror classic ""Saw"" has writer-and-director James Wan as executive producer.

1869872,5,B00008YOD2,"Saw II is that rare movie that stays intriguing and believable the entire way through, while maintaining a cohesive storyline and gore to spare. The acting is solid, the scares are real, and the viewer is trying just as hard as Donnie Wahlberg's Detective Matthews to solve the mystery. What's most amazing is that all the clues really are right before your eyes.

At the beginning of the film, Jigsaw has committed another grisly murder, and left his calling card for Detective Matthews to track him down. Matthews reluctantly takes the case and quickly locates Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) in his warehouse lair. But this is only the beginning of another one of Jigsaw's intricate games.

Now eight people, including Matthews' son, are trapped in a house where deadly nerve gas is seeping through the walls and into their bodies. As the police try to locate the house and figure out a way to rescue the prisoners, they are also trying to figure their own way out together, while fighting amongst themselves to find out what connects them all.

The suspense in this film is palpable and Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is one of the best horror franchise ""bad guys"" in years. His twisted sense of morality: ""Those that don't appreciate life do not deserve it"" is the kind of terrible explanation that makes a psychopath real and frightening.

The twists that this film takes are surprising and show the kind of intelligence that the majority of horror schlock coming out these days is severely lacking.

The DVD extras are truly spectacular. The viewer gets a look at how the set designers laid out every one of the various traps in the film, from the needle pit to the furnace trap. All the props are also examined (the bat with nails in it, etc.). Overall, this is the kind of horror film that is watchable over and over again and the kind of film that makes a great addition to any collection.",1174867200,,1876,4.672727272727273

1869876,2,B00008YOD2,"The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.

1869903,5,B00008YOD2,"There are a lot of different viewpoints about this movie, so let's just get them all out in the open.

THE DIALOGUE: The dialogue is a little awkward, especially toward the beginning, and there is a ton of totally unneeded profanity. The reason the dialogue is awkward toward the beginning is, as in the first one, the screenwriters are trying to pack a lot of information into the first few minutes so they can move on with the storyline.

THE CHARACTERS: They are extremely unbelievable at times, fighting at the drop of a hat, and yet no one seems to understand the concept of discussing their problems. Despite the writing, the acting was MUCH better than in the last film, only bad in a few spots. Tobin Bell is absolutely chilling as Jigsaw.

THE VIOLENCE: I resent that these movies often have the word ""torture"" attached to them, especially in reviews. When I hear torture, I think someone strapped to a table or chair being purposefully hurt by their captor. This is not what happens here. The people are simply forced to decide how much pain their willing to endure in order to live.

THE ""TRAPS"": I think that every trap in this movie is brilliant, from the pool of syringes to the large oven with the antidote in the back. You have to listen to what Jigsaw says. He has a way with words, and every word he says is important. If his rules aren't followed, the consequences are dire.

SICK?: I have to admit, there are a few scenes in this movie that were a little bit hard to watch (ie: the woman in the pool of syringes) but I wouldn't say that any of the scenes were ""sick."" There is pervasive violence and blood. This movie is certainly not one to be showing your elementary-schooler.

THE ENDING (No Spoilers): Wow. That was absolutely amazing. The first Saw had a pretty huge twist at the end, but the twist awaiting you at the end of Saw II blows the other one out of the water. As with the last movie, the final scene is a ""collage"" of images and dialogue from the movie, explaining the twist and how they dropped little hints throughout. I just sat there after the movie, absolutely speechless.

OVERALL: This is what movie-making is supposed to be like. With all that horrible junk they call ""horror"" these days, it's refreshing to see a movie with an extremely original and brilliant premise with tense scenes and blood throughout. Saw II is SO much better than the first one, so even if you thought the first one was just so-so, you really need to check this out. I cannot wait to see the third installment in what has already becomed one of the most brilliant horror franchises in the business.",1170460800,2,2617,4.508438818565401
1869904,5,B00008YOD2,"The blood games continue in ""Saw II"", as a SWAT team has finally tracked down the Jigsaw killer and raids his hideaway, but an obstacle remains to carting the killer off to jail: a new game is in progress, and from his warehouse base-of-operations, Jigsaw holds the keys to the fates of not two but eight new victims caught in a new deathtrap that occupies an entire re-inforced, inescapable house.

  The 'participants' in this latest game are a more disparate, and often highly hostile, group as compared to previous captives, and it appears that the more sympathetic characters are going to have threats other than the ones Jigsaw's assembled to deal with.  And complicating matters for the police who have to try and navigate this unexpected development without getting anyone killed is this: one of the eight is the teenage son of the detective in charge.  The challenges are ghastly, the secrets behind all this sinister, and the complexity of the whole saga really begins getting driven up here.  Another universally great job by the movie's actors and actresses, including Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Jigsaw's first 'return victim', who survives her ordeal in the original 'Saw' only to be captured again.

1869940,4,B00008YOD2,"Aside from the unimportant innacuracy in the synopsis provided with the DVD (Matthews did not actually begin a full investigation, he merely tagged along on the raid), I have no gripes with Saw II.

I will try to avoid being too impressed with the death and torture devices used in the movie for fear of sounding too morbid (especially since I can be so squeemish). What I will shoot for, instead, is showing my admiration with how well they were used within the script. And while I am on the subject, I thought Saw II was very well written.

Neither the acting, nor the dialogue was the focus of the movie. Our attention is directed at the ""game."" We needn't focus on feelings of ""Hey that guy was in Showgirls"" or ""Hey that kid reminds me way too much of Malcolm in the Middle."" We are free to enjoy the plot without reservation. What will happen next? What is around that corner? What is on the other side of that door? How will it all end?!

Saw II was not the horror film that Saw was. The sequel would be better described as a (relatively) gory suspense movie. Nothing from part 2 made me apprehensive about my own daily routine as part 1 was able to do. And that is a sign of a good scary movie: one from which you are changed, for even a moment. Even if it is a few days later and you are getting into your car at night and you have a sudden panic that just maybe there is someone laying down, hidden in your back seat, THAT was a good scary movie. Saw I had that, Saw II did not. I did not love either movie. I liked them both, just for different reasons.

1869942,4,B00008YOD2,"The financial rewards reaped by the low-budget original ""Saw"" guaranteed a sequel. Fortunately, it also meant that the perpetrators of the first movie were given a little more money and time to hone their movie's rough edges. The resulting ""Saw II"" is a superior movie, and my favorite of the first three.

Jigsaw's master plan to teach his victims their life lesson is to trap a group of interconnected people in a booby trap laden house. In the opposite end of town, he is apprehended by an angry, bitter, Donnie (""I'm Not Mark"") Whalberg. But then the trick of the Saw movies comes into play. Whalberg's son is in the house of horrors and all the other victims have a connection to the crooked cop that sent them to jail. All Whalberg has to do is just stay where he is, Jigsaw cooly (and superbly played by Tobin Bell) instructs him, and the son will be given back to him. (Along with the movie's catch phrase ""Oh yes, there will be blood."")

Of course, the house where all the others are trapped is tricked out with multiple killing games and the police at Jigsaw's hideout are reduced to watching as, one by one, they meet their gory demises. This is another point where ""Saw II"" betters its origin. I found it increasingly hard to care what happened to the to protagonists in the first film, and got to the point where - except for the final twist - I was finding the movie to be almost laughable. In ""Saw II,"" there are so many people in so much trouble that it turns into a game of ten little Indians; who is going to get picked off next, and how? Can Whalberg control his rage at Jigsaw and get his safely returned son as reward? Add to the mix the movie's relentless pacing, and ""Saw II"" became both a horror/gore fest and a suspense movie.

There is also a tight twist at the end to set up ""Saw 3"" (even if I believe this to be the superior movie), and all sorts of loose ends that can appear in the plans for two more in the franchise. As horror movies go, ""Saw II"" gets two bloody slashed-off thumbs up.",1163030400,,2017,4.330687830687831

So the only thing that was kept was the twist ending. It seems everything else from the first, that I enjoyed, was lost. A great example of how important keeping the same writer and crew makes all the difference.

Then about 3 or 4 months later the infamous UNCUT, UNEDITED, NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN, UNRATED version appears on DVD.  Unfortunately for me, I like to buy these films on the day that they are released so I can add them to my collection, so a few months down the line I get to dish out another $20 or so for the UNRATED version.  With part one I actually got an additional 20 seconds of gore for my extra purchase, wow! This one, I have compared with my ""R"" rated version and there is no difference in the gore whatsoever.  Some scenes are extended and that is about it.  This is why the running times are different.  Then you get a second disk, which has a few extras concerning the film, and the rest was obviously just thrown together to help sell this version.  It is a great movie, better than part one I think, but if you already own the ""R"" rated version don't rush out and buy this one.

1869988,5,B00008YOD2,"I can't make a decent review of the movie, so I'll just share some of

my thoughts on it. Here goes nothing: First of all, this was NOT a

ripoff of CUBE. True enough, both movies involve a theme of strangers

being trapped in a mystery house full of traps and dangers; however,

the similarities end there. Okay? Now shut up about it, if that's what

has been holding you back from seeing it.

By far and wide, there were definitely some scenes in this movie which

were hard to watch, but they worked in the aspect of the movie. It's a

perfect example of gore being used to further the horror of a

situation, rather than exploiting it for that purpose. Needless (now I

shudder at how similar that word is to another one...) to say, this

movie was less a splatter film and more of a psychological mystery -

JUST like the original SAW.

One slight problem I had with the movie was a fault entirely of my own.

For quite some time now, I knew something about how this movie was

going to end. No-no, don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away;

but basically I'll use this analogy: Let's say someone in 1983 who

never saw the original two STAR WARS movies hears about RETURN OF THE

JEDI coming, and that there's something about Han Solo having to get

rescued. They get curious, and they watch the first movie. Then,

shortly before RETURN comes out, they see EMPIRE, but already they know

that Han Solo gets into some kind of trouble. Carbonite, et al,

happens, and it's just not as effective, but it was still a good movie.

That's what my situation was with the SAW movies; I watched the first

one, loved it, and as I waited and waited for II to come out on DVD in

its uncut edition (I'm a dork, I know), I keep hearing things about the

third movie which began to make me think. I prettymuch had the end to

SAW II figured out for a while, and the whole time I was watching it, I

was hoping to be corrected. Unfortunately, I was right...but you see,

there are TWO twists to this movie, which both happen back-to-back and

within one another. I wasn't sure what the *other* twist was, at first,

but reading some of the spoiler-heavy posts on the message board after

watching the movie, I suddenly got slapped in the face with that other

twist...and needless to say, I spent a good few minutes laughing at the

shock of it. So, I got my awesome twist ending after all...even if I

knew one aspect of it already.

I did give this movie a 9 out of 10 star rating, and that was because

of a few problems I had with it. One of them was my above ""spoiled

foreshadowing,"" but that hardly is a reason to dislike the movie. My

problems were mostly in a couple of the characters. Here you have such

complicated and profound characters like Jigsaw, and this movie does a

really good job at exploring them; and then there's Xavier and

Detective Eric Matthews. Some of the decisions they make in the movie

work only to further the plot, and are either very unprecedented or

disagreeable. Something Xavier does at one point is so left-field and

horrendous, and it really bugs me that he did it; but then again, it

helped the plot along, and I guess that makes up for it. On a further

note about him, I liked Franky G in THE Italian JOB, and I thought he

was a very talented actor there; seeing him in this role made me feel

like it was a bit of a waste for him. Oh well, he's getting more famous

now, anyway.

Oh, speaking of actors, I really enjoyed Shawnee Smith. She was

basically the star of the movie, to me; her character of Amanda, from

her reaction to waking up in the house and screaming her horror,

to...other, later points (gah, I swear that pun was unintended!), was

executed with real conviction and talent. I, for one, am a fan of this

actress now. And Tobin Bell...he has set the high bar on what a villain

is like, and I, for one, thought he did splendidly as the awesomely

complicated Jigsaw.

So in retrospect, this movie was full of thrills, twists, and tons of

scares. It was every bit as good as the original, and even a bit better

at times. All in all, SAW II was a perfect example of a psychological

horror movie done right, and an excellent follow-up to its

groundbreaking predecessor.

1869989,4,B00008YOD2,"I was quite impressed with the original Saw and had high hopes for the second film.  While the film has many of the qualities that made the original so good it does have a few drawbacks.  This time the main story is really the investigation into the Jigsaw crimes.  The secondary story involves eight people locked in a house filled with a deadly nerve agent.  They have two hours to find the antidotes so that they can survive the three hours until the doors unlock.  One of the eight is the detective's son.  After an opening death involving a death mask, the detective tracks down Jigsaw.  He also find monitors showing what is going on with the eight people in the locked house.

The detective tries to get information out of Jigsaw while technicians try to discover where the video signal is coming from.  There is a lot of time spent with Jigsaw and we learn quite a bit about his character.  In the house, people begin to fall to elaborate traps as they look for the antidotes.  The two plot lines eventually merge and we get some more of the wonderful twists that helped make the first movie so chilling.

The people in the house just didn't work too well for me.  There was not the same sense of desperation and helplessness as provided by simple chains in the firs movie.  Here the people are free to roam the house and there are weapons available.  The invisible nerve agent seen only in the form of some coughing (twice with blood) also did not provide tension in the way a clock on the wall did in Saw.  The deaths that occur in the house seem lees like Jigsaw's earlier games.  It is not apparent how the victims can win the games and appears more like a minefield than something that can be though or toughed out.  Still, it was a good film with good twists and serious psychological aspects.  By itself it is a good horror film but compared to the first it is somewhat lacking.  Check it out.",1160524800,,1908,4.412607449856734
1869990,5,B00008YOD2,"Saw 2 is more cmplex and more compelling than the first Saw in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the first one was great, but this one has more suspense. I won'ty explain the plot, since other have already done that. It has more gore than the last one, and it also shows a few past events from the first movie for anyone who hasn't seen the first one.

Also, there's an added twsit at the end that I feel the need to explain to anyone who may be confused. This is what I'm talking about: At the end of the movie, the police officer Matthew's crew see a safe open, and inside of it is Matthew's son with an oxygen mask. A lot of people were confused by this because of the video cameras that showed what Matthew's son and the others are doing to get out of this old house/prison they're stuck in, which were shown on the computers. And as we've seen in the video, Amanda knocks out Matt's son. But how could he end up in the safe? Well, here's my theory: Whatever the video cameras viewed was TAPED and was put in the computers by Jigsaw himself. After Amanda knocked Matt's son out, he put him in that safe where no one could hear him, even though Jigsaw and Matt were right next to the safe. Matt and his crew were watching something recorded, perhaps it was recorded the night before or something.

But why did Amanda knock out Matt's son? Well, first thing's first: Matt ties up Jigsaw, (who has severe cancer), and forces him tell Matt the directions to the house his son and the others are in. But he has to brutally beat him before he can get any info. out of him, which kills Jigsaw. When Matt enters the house, he steps into a giant, and obviously old, bathroom - the same bathroom from the first one, where the 2 main characters were tied up in. He finds a tape recorder and plays it, and it's the voice of Amanda. She talks about how after Jigsaw helped her get over her drug addiction by horrible means, she was inspired by him, and was determined to become his apprentice - which she did. He taught her all of his moves and skills and whatnot. So, she has come to take his place. After the tape ends, a being comes out the tub behind him and knocks him unconcious. Who is it? It's her. As a side note, the reason she didn't kill his son is because he, obciously, passed the ""test"" so he hopefully learned his lesson. It also shows us that Amanda was the one who set up the enitire trap, and this was a test of what she learned from Jigsaw

I know I kind of got off track with the previous paragraph, but I figured that since I said that Amanda knocked out Matt's son, I might as well, explain why, which also kinda spoils the ending. Still, I got my point across with the 2nd paragraph. So if you're a fan of the first movie, I highly doubt you'll be dissapointed with this sequel. Sequels to movie usually suck, but this is one of those exceptions. Can't wait for Saw 3!",1158019200,3,2881,4.206148282097649

1869992,3,B00008YOD2,"I reviewed the first Saw movie, and unearthed it for what it was an amalgam of several other movies but it was not the perfect blend of all of them, more like a serious rip off. This sequel had to happen, because Twisted Pictures and the powers that be in Hollywood had a Bloody cash cow on their hands with all the minions of teenagers who wouldn't know original material if it reached out and snatched the Abercrombie hoodie off their backs. Again, thanks to the power of free DVDs at the library I grabbed SAW deuce and watched it with an open mind and lots of coffee of course. I actually love Donnie Walberg, I have since he took the one side of his manly overalls and let them hang while dancing with New Kids on the Block, so he was a good surprise. The story line is a basic one gruesome murder, similar to the first movies MO, a detective, and more victims but instead of individual attention they are all stuck in one house and slowly being poisoned, they have to find keys to doors, and search for antidotes, and figure out why they are all there. The SECOND I saw friggin Lucy from 7th Heaven I giggled with glee because the thought of seeing that pie faced whiner get offed in some gory way was like an early birthday present unfortunately she just slowly expired from the poison. The first Saw, had a twist that I didn't see coming, this one, not so much. Bringing a previous victim in (Amanda), especially one who professed to be ""helped"" by Jigsaw in the first was its biggest mistake. I knew she was in on the whole thing the second she woke up. The tests for the victims were lame, and we only get to see 3 of them really: the oven, the needles and the clear box, none of them made me want to look away, which is the telltale sign your scaring me or grossing me out. By the end I seriously cared more about Amanda surviving knowing she was one of the bad guys, more than the kid and the detective, mainly because Donnie Walberg was such a sucky parent and a crooked cop, and the kid because he was really the innocent I knew wouldn't die, Jiggy doesn't work that way he is such a moral man. So Saw 3 is coming out soon, and we all know that Amanda is now the puppet master, what I want to see is her lock up one by one Paris and Lindsay and Nicole and Ashley and Jessica and Brittney, take away all their phones, miniature dogs, fake tans, hair bleach, plastic surgery and make them choose between 15 minutes more of fame or their looks.",1155081600,,2455,4.2366737739872065

1870018,3,B00008YOD2,"""Saw II"" slaps us on the torture rack, then tightens the screws until every last gasp, shiver and shriek has been squeezed right out of us.

Just when we think we've endured enough cruel and unusual punishment, director and co-writer Darren Lynn Bousman takes it up a notch with the zeal of a modern-day Marquis de Sade.

That this first-time director performs this evisceration of our nerves, and does it so well, will likely touch off even more concerns about the extreme violence in today's movies. As it should, really.

But, for the tough-as-Leatherface horror crowd who want to be bruised and battered by their entertainment, ""Saw II"" represents a cut above in the genre.

The sequel to last year's sleeper Halloween hit wastes no time reintroducing us to the grisly handiwork of Jigsaw, a terminally ill serial killer hell-bent on testing people who have made messes of their lives.

In the first ""Saw,"" Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell played two unlucky guys who wake up to find themselves chained in a dirty subterranean room, with a saw as their only means of escape. The scrappy first film had an estimated budget of $1.2 million, and went on to make more than $55 million during its theatrical run. It's been reviled, praised and rabidly discussed on the Internet.

""Saw"" had a shocker of an ending, an original villain and a delightful scream-queen performance from used-to-be golden boy Elwes (""The Princess Bride"").

In the sequel, conceived right after the first struck a box-office jugular, the cheap thrills remain, but the surprises are mostly gone. There are a few good twists in ""Saw II,"" but none that rivals the pop-up corpse shocker from the original.

As in the original, Jigsaw uses a puppet as an alter ego to let the cops know why he's punishing sinners unappreciative of what life has given them. A warped medieval mentality runs homicidally through ""Saw II"" as ""screw-ups"" are flambeed, thrown into a pit of hypodermic needles and clubbed on the head with a spiked bat.

For the sequel, Bousman and co-writer Whannell up the body count, stranding eight victims in a booby-trapped house that looks like Freddy Krueger was its interior decorator. The eight must figure out how to get at an antidote before poison gas pumped into the vents does them in. Among those trapped inside is the son of a burnt-out detective, Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg of the defunct ""Boomtown"" TV show).

Of the new victims, the quick-fused Franky G. gives the meanest and most capable performance. Others seem to be standard horror bait.

""Saw II"" is a tighter, more focused film than its predecessor. But even though this sequel is well-made, it lacks the over-the-top campiness of the first movie.

What ""Saw II"" needs is a wailing and moaning Elwes to make us snicker when the bloodletting is just too much to handle. In ""Saw II,"" everyone is deadly serious about the carnage, which makes the film effective, but also unshakably disturbing.",1151971200,4,2959,4.884231536926148

The movie leaves behind suspense and relies on red corn syrup and jerky camera movement for the scares.  Hey, that's cool, but that is not what the first one relied on.  And the acting?  Well, with such absurd writing, I can't blame them, for failing to look scared or even stay awake (that seventh heaven girl looked as bored as I did, but as least she got to sleep!).  And that opening scene...that guy CAN'T ACT!

For what it's worth, if you find absurd blood and alpha male being all mean scary, then you may find this interesting.  At least, they avoided some perverse sex/violence scene.

What's worse, is when you watch the extras you learn the writers buy into this absurd notion of torturing people to make them enjoy life.  Sure, we don't appreciate life, blah, blah, blah.  (It's as cliched as a Japanese horror movie with a creepy girl in some water)

This is a captivating movie that instead of just one persons will to live it is a team of 6 or 7 people who must all work together to work their way out.

1870022,4,B00008YOD2,"When it comes to films almost everybody can agree that sequels to hit movies usually never do as good. Its sort of like a curse, most sequels usually aren't as good as the originals but then again there are some major exceptions. Last year director James Wan brought us the horror masterpiece Saw, the independent feature which took both theaters and audiences by storm. Using a great story with some very interesting characters and a shocking twist to leave the fans with their jaws dropped to the ground. A year later Darren Lynn Bousman brings us an all new sequel featuring the famous Jigsaw once again to do what he does best. After many months of waiting I was so anxious and excited to finally see it.

In this new installment we fallow Detective Eric Mason, a cop who is on the fast track of finding the Jigsaw killer. After a gruesome discovery Mason finds a clue and tracks Jigsaw to his personal lair. What Mason doesn't know is that there is a game being played during the investigation. A group of 8 strangers awaken and find themselves trapped in a house with no exit and no clue as to where they are. Filled with traps and deadly nerve gas, the group of strangers must find a way out of the house (or a cure) in 2 hours time before they die.

I enjoyed the hell out of the first Saw, I thought it was a brilliant film not just for the cool story but also for the surprising suspense and turn near the end. So im happy to say that this new sequel is a must see for the fans of the first film. In this movie we are introduced to alot of new interesting characters and even get to see some old ones return. I liked the new story line alot. Much like the first film the story to this one fits much like a puzzle. The more the film passes the more of an understanding you have with both the characters and plot. I enjoyed everything from the story line to the wonderful new traps set up by the Jigsaw killer. For a sequel it does a wonderful job of giving the audience double of what we got from the first film. This movie has more characters, more traps, more blood and even more twists and turns. Im also really glad that they tied it with the first movie.

What really killed it for some of the audience in the first film was the acting (and there is a real good reason for that). Well luckily with this film the acting is much better and more convincing. As I mentioned before this movie has more traps and the wonderful red stuff that we all seem to enjoy. The traps in this film are much more terrifying and can be pretty hard to stomach if you picture yourself in some of the characters situations. Theres everything from headgear, poison gas, needles and even a really cool easy bake oven. With all the cool new traps it definitely builds up some good suspense, even a few jumpy moments here and there. This movie has twice the thrills and overall violence which will leave the audience anticipated for whats going to happen next.

As I also mentioned before this film is somewhat tied together with the first one. The setting and visuals are almost the same, its just as dark and imaginative. Only instead of seeing two guys trapped in a bathroom we get to see 8 people trapped in a house fighting and trying their best to survive and find an antidote. The direction it took is very memorable and much like the first movie theres a very neat twist at the end. I won't get into details but I will say that its a very interesting one. Its not as shocking and suspenseful like it was in the first film, but its a pretty good one none the less. Its not a perfect sequel and I did like the first film better by half an inch. But im proud to say that this sequel was worth the admission. Much like the first movie this one isn't going to be everyones cup of tea, but if you do happen to be a big fan of the first movie then I really recommend checking out this sequel.

There is toxic fumes coming out of the vents, and these fumes are slowly killing the victims.  The antidote is around the house somewhere.  Like in the first movie, we find out a little something about each person there.  Meanwhile, a detective is looking for his son, who is in the house with the other four.

This is bloodier than the first.  Is it better?  Maybe.  The ending will shock you as it did me.  From the sounds of it, there's going to be a Saw 3.

1870042,1,B00008YOD2,"I'll start by saying that this is nowhere near as good as the first. I also feel that fans of the first Saw who liked this sequal obviously didn't get the first movie. The first was an intelligent albeit grisley murder mystery thiller, comparable to Seven, Natural Born Killers, and 8mm; it was NOT a horror movie. Saw 2 on the other hand is just that: a horror flick pure and simple. The story this time around is trite and flawed immensly.

Dina Meyer's character is so poorly written as to be an insult to police investigators everywhere. She's supposed to be an expert on Jigsaw, yet falls for every trap he has. She should have been able to solve Jigsaw's riddles in two minutes, but never did. Some expert.

As for the characters in the house, pure stereotypical horror movie drivel. There's no interesting performances nor really anything to make you care about any of the characters,which we all know is that they'll all end up dead. There are few surprises throughout the film and when they do come is too late because I was too frustated with the rest of the film to care.

Donnie Walberg's character was just pathetically written. The entire time Jigsaw tells him everything he needs to do and everything about him that is wrong, and yet he still acts that way, still gets angry, still walks right into everything that was set up for him. Cornball to the max.

My conclusion about this film is that is isn't a creative work by a great young talented writer like the first, but a hack horror flick trying to cash in on the popularity of the first, without much work going into the story. No, it is not garrenteed that if you like the first you'll like the second. If you saw the first film as nothing more than a gorefest, and liked that, you'll get your bloody fill of violence here. But if you liked Saw for it's psycological and philosophic aspects, and the great performances, you'll hate Saw 2. I feel it's a big waste of time to watch.",1145750400,2,1951,4.47191011235955

1870080,3,B00008YOD2,"I'm going to name 3 movies: Rosemary's Baby, the Shining, the Exorcist. What did they have in common? They scared the living hell out of everyone that watched it(some less so but oh well). What about films like Scream or Urban Legend or that Summer one? It was cool seeing WB stars getting chopped up. And now we have the latest batch of horror movies: out and out full-on gore movies. This film and it's prequel, Wolf Creek and Hostel were films with really quick editing and brutal gore. But personally that's not scary, it's just gross. Saw 2 doesn't change this, even though it's admittedly good concept is intact.

The Jigsaw Killer is hard to describe as a murderer since he doesn't actually do it, his victims do. Being someone who ""saves people's lives"", he devises ways where people have to do something painful in order to escape. Most of them don't escape and that's where the gore comes in. It's a neat idea, although Seven used this in a way, it's just the filmmakers are a little frustrating in making a genuinely good horror movie.

A detective finds out his son is locked in a room along with a couple others and their game is this: a nerve gas is in the house they're in and they have to find the antidote in 2 hours or they'll die. So we jump between 2 stories: the detective trying to solve it on his end and the unfortunate victims who might face their grisly ends.

The film's central line is ""oh yes, there will be blood"" and it's a pretty spot-on tagline: gore is very rampant here, probably moreso than the original which you will always expect. ""Carnage candy"" as a kid in Scream 2 puts it but after awhile it kind of gets old, it's not as shocking anymore when the 4th one gets taken down in a grisly fashion and you don't feel disgusted anymore, at least I didn't. Sure it's gory but when we don't care about anyone living or dying, having someone die in a gory way is like ""ooh, that hurt"" rather than just being horrified.

It is a film concept that can be so much more but unfortunately these films are just a way to kill people in grisly fashions and call it a horror movie. Rent at your own risk.",1144195200,,2128,4.352644836272041

1870082,3,B00008YOD2,"I viewed Saw II (I now refuse to say ""saw"" in connection with this series) immediately after watching Saw thanks to my buddy Matt, who bought both DVDs and then let me borrow them. With the first movie fresh in my mind, I slid the disc into my DVD player and held my breath.

If Saw was a homage of Se7en, Saw II is a rip-off of Cube.  If you haven't seen Cube, here's the premise: total strangers wake up in a room.  The room is part of a larger structure that is really just an excuse to off the victims one by one with innovative death traps. Cube is one of my favorite movies, because the cube had its own internal logic.  It was an interesting, horrifying existential take on the best and worst of the human condition.

Just like Cube, Saw II has the usual cast of characters: the slinky femme fatale (Addison, played by the gorgeous Emmanuelle Vaugier), the stressed out freak (Obi, played by Tim Burd), the neurotic schlub (always the first to die, who cares who plays him), the sweet-as-pie innocent (Laura, played by Beverley Mitchell), the young punk (Daniel, played by Erik Knudsen), the mole (Shawnee Smith reprising her role as Amanda), the leader (Jonas, played by Glenn Plummer) and last but not least the most important character of all: the psychopath (Xavier, played with hulking brutality by Franky G)!  That's right ladies and gentlemen, it's not just enough to put complete strangers in a room full of traps, it helps if you mix it up a bit by adding a slavering nutjob who isn't afraid to get through the traps by throwing other people into them.

If Saw II sounds like a completely different film from the first, you're right.  According to IMDB, this WAS another film that was retooled as a sequel to Saw.  It shows.

Interspersed between shots of the wacky Funhouse of Death is a psychological standoff between Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Daniel's father Eric, played by... Donnie Wahlberg! Curse you Wahlberg, was it not enough that you were a muttering bald man in Dreamcatcher?  Is there no end to the spread of your evil?

Ahem.  Anyway, Wahlberg spits venom, knocks stuff over, and utterly fails to be convincing as a concerned father, a tough cop, or an actual menace to Jigsaw.  By the end of the movie, I felt pretty bad for `ole Jigsaw.  I mean, all the guy is trying to do is make an entertaining film by killing off a bunch of crooks.  Is that so bad?

This film's traps are considerably more elaborate and the gore factor is definitely upped; enough that I was given pause while eating pizza (Will I never learn?  CURSE YOU WAHLBERG!).  The clever riddles that Jigsaw gives Detective Wahlberg are lost in the whip-snap camera shots, rendering the second plot more of a distraction than anything else.  The final twist is more of a cheat, but the real payoff is in knowing what happened to the characters from the first movie.

In the end, this sequel can't possibly duplicate the taut thrills of Saw because it's actually two films awkwardly mashed together. And it has Wahlberg. Given the conclusion, perhaps we have finally seen the end of my arch nemesis.

I didn't love 'Saw II'. Not to suggest that it's a bad movie, because it's not. But it's not half as good as its prequel.

This time round, bent cop Eric (Donnie Wahlberg) must find a way to help his wayward son Daniel out of serial killer Jigsaw's booby-trapped house of horrors, along with eight other victims, before they inhale too much toxic nerve gas. The catch? Eric must do this remotely, as Jigsaw's not feeling very helpful, and the only link between father and son is a video feed of the victim's progress. It's 'Big Brother' meets 'Silence of the Lambs', although not in a very original way.

Put simply, 'Saw II' is a more mainstream and much less satisfying movie than the original. Think of the differences between 'Blair Witch' and 'Book of Shadows' and you'll know what I mean - even if 'Saw II' is infinitely superior to the Blair Witch sequel. Instead of two men caught in a claustrophobic web of hoplessness, we now have nine stereotypical criminals with broadly-drawn personalities (the hooker, the tough guy, the flake, the crazy, the wise one, the kid... and so forth...) running afoul of an increasingly more elaborate and blatantly obvious series of booby traps. There's no real sense of tension to this, and the obvious voyeurism with which director Darren Lynn Bousman shows the various deaths serves only to annoy fans of the careful atmosphere of the original, and bore everyone else - we've seen it all before. Okay, so there's a time limit on how long the kidnap victims can survive with the gas - so what? We already know most of them will die, anyway, so what's the use in getting excited about it?

But still, 'Saw II' does have some good points. The overall standard of acting is much, much higher than in the original, with Donnie Wahlberg turning in a convincing and fluid performance as Eric. Tobin Bell as Jigsaw gets a much meatier role in this movie than in the first, and plays it well enough. And while the direction is not at all as successful as the original movie, it's still decent enough, and does lack the superfluous 'fluffing' of the prequel.

The dialogue is still awful, mind you, and this is not a movie you need to own. The first twist in the tale can be seen coming from a hundred miles away (although there is a nice link between the first and second movies, here), but the ultimate twist is a satisfying one.

1870117,3,B00008YOD2,"Last year, Saw rocked the horror-film world. With an interesting plot - a serial killer named ""Jigsaw"" kidnaps people, then makes them do horrible things to earn their release - and some incredibly intense scenes, Saw was a breath of fresh air for a too-often clich&eacute; genre.

Saw II doesn't fare nearly as well, though it eliminates the low-budget, flat-out bad acting of the original. Drenched in gross-out gore, shallow characters and a now-worn plot, it can't live up to the legacy of its predecessor.

The original movie certainly had its fair share of blood, but the sequel tops it. The scripts has the characters shot in the head, bleeding from the eyes, rolling in vats of hypodermic needles, cutting their wrists, burning to death, slicing their arms to pieces and passing out from deadly gas. All this is fine and dandy, but it comes at the expense of character development.

One of the first movie's best aspects was that it told the audience why each character was chosen for kidnapping by Jigsaw. One is a private investigator, another a drug addict. Jigsaw uses his ""puzzles"" to make his victims face their flaws and, if they can stomach it, do what they need to to survive.

In Saw II, however, there is but passing mention of why the victims are there. There's the drug dealer, the suicidal woman (the drug addict from the first movie who, apparently, has found new vices to replace the old ones Jigsaw helped her overcome), etc., but the viewer never relates to any of them.

Finally, the recycled plot can't make the movie worthwhile. There is a new twist - a detective arrives at a crime scene to find a message from Jigsaw, then catches the killer. Jigsaw, it turns out, is a dying cancer patient who wants to force others to see the value of the survival instinct.

From there, though, it's Saw all over again. Before his capture, Jigsaw and his accomplices kidnapped some people and, you guessed it, drugged them up and put them in a room in an abandoned warehouse. There's a clock ticking, and when it runs out they'll all die.

Even the movie's very first scene, the murder the detective later finds the message at, is a rehash of a scene from Saw. A man (instead of a woman like last time!) has a device strapped to his head that will kill him if he doesn't unlock it first. The key is in the person's eye, where last time it was in a dying human body's stomach. And the machine will drive spikes through the new victim's brain instead of ripping his jaw apart.

In short, Saw II is good for some skin-crawling, nauseating scenes, but it can't match the intelligence, character development and innovation of its predecessor.",1143676800,,2654,4.643923240938166

The Jigsaw is about to teach him a lesson about his life and now he deals with it. Can he save his only son as is poisoned to death by a toxic nerve-agent before he can save himself? Or will the Jigsaw once more come out victorious?

Saw II returns to the original concept of the original. The new installment though seems a little stale. The idea of a serial killer that doesn't kill anyone, even though intriguing in the first film, is definitely starting to lose its freshness. Starting to smell a little funky. The first Saw was smart and unique. Saw II is a step down from the original script written by Leigh Whannell and Saw I director, James Wan. With Wan gone from this picture and Bousman added, there seems to be a lack of chemistry between Whannell and the director of Saw II, compared to the director of Saw I.

There are a few attributes of this film that are the makings of a noticeable and downward spiral for the Saw series. First off, that I noticed, has got to be the lighting. In the first film, the lighting was gritty and sickly-looking, which was one of my favorite parts of he original. Saw II though, is cast in a perpetual shadow. More then three-quarters of the movie are inhabited by a sheer darkness that interrupts some the gritty and unhygienic feel of the first one. The acting was also a low point of this film. Both Donnie Wahlberg and Shawnee Smith are unqualified to have leading roles and show it by not pulling off their roles.

On the other hand, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw was even more creepy then in the first movie. But then again, the first movie only allowed him a short part to play. Saw II delves deeper in to the character of John Kramer, also known as the Jigsaw. The character of John Kramer is a very sick man. With his body infected with terminal cancer, he has decided to spend the rest of his short time remaining, teaching other people to enjoy life while you have it. Through putting people in a position where it's either you face your fears or you die, he believes that people will have a change of heart. For playing a very complex character, Tobin Bell pulls off quite a stellar job as this monster.

With Saw II in the theaters, and Saw III already in preproduction, people can only imagine what else the Saw series has in store for us. The gore and ruthlessness of the first movie is still there and will sure bring back fans of the first one. But I would not recommend seeing Saw II without have previously seeing the first. Even if you already have seen Saw II, but have yet to seen Saw I, I would recommend seeing the first. Saw was an original, uncomfortable, and suspenseful joy-ride of a film, but Saw II is a shell of it's former self. But who knows, the solution to Saw III may prove all of us naysayers wrong. Saw II could be a lot better if some more things are proven and shown in the third film. But don't look for spoilers before you see the movies! That's against the rules.

1870123,3,B00008YOD2,"Saw II (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2005)

I was one of the people who thought the original Saw was a work of sheer brilliance, one of the best horror films to emerge from the overworked Hollywood machine in years, if not decades, and the herald of a new golden age in American horror. (Well, so far, we've got Hostel, at least.) As Leigh Whanell stuck around to write the script for Saw II, once again co-writing it with the film's director, there seemed a reasonable amount of promise that the sequel would, if not measure up to the original, at least hold its own and be better than the average sequel. And, well, guilty on all counts.

This could have actually been entitled Cube, Leigh Whannell-style. It's certainly head and shoulders above either of Cube's painfully anemic sequels. But while Cube is the movie's obvious spiritual daddy, there are certainly a lot more references to old (and more recent) horror films here to choose from; given Whannell's love of intricacy, it's pretty obvious these are conscious, which makes it loads of fun to play spot-the-influence. (The opening scene is a direct homage to one of my favorite recent indie horror films; I knew from the first five minutes that no matter how bad this movie turned out to be, I'd have a soft spot in my heart for it, if only for that.) Technically, it's just as good as the original, which surprised me; the film's major failing lies in... well, I'm getting ahead of myself.

Eric Matthews (The Sixth Sense's Donnie Wahlberg), a former beat cop gone to seed while driving a desk, is called out to the site of the latest Jigsaw killing-- one of his informants. Jigsaw has painted a message on the room's wall that names Matthews, but despite this, he's too occupied not only with his other cases, but his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen, recently of The Prizewinner of Defiance, Ohio), who's turning into a juvenile delinquent. Matthews, however, notices the one thing at the crime scene that will blow the case open; it does, but as Matthews finds out, Jigsaw does have a habit of making sure everything, down to the final detail, is planned-- Matthews and his team are forced to solve Jigsaw's next puzzle, which involves eight people stuck in a trapped house-- one of whom is Daniel.

The mystery angle of the film, like that of its predecessor, is immaculately done. Everything falls into place (with one odd exception that makes me wonder if there's a deleted scene that contains it) perfectly, and it's a pleasure to watch, even if it wears thin in places; there was at least one aspect of the big picture I figured out at least ten minutes before I should have. The film's main characters are relatively well drawn, though, with the larger cast of this film, that translates to the minor characters getting rather short shrift, especially Laura (Seventh Heaven's Beverley Mitchell, though it's possible there's another deleted scene or two floating about that fills in some unanswered questions we end up with about her). That said, everyone acts the parts they get, and acts them well. Not the actors' fault if the parts are sometimes threadbare. They do the best with what they get, and Whannell and Bousman have come up with a solid cast of underrated Hollywood young-and-beautifuls here; Wahlberg shows that his star turn in The Sixth Sense, as small as it was, was not a fluke, Glenn Plummer (Strange Days) does a fascinating Mos Def impersonation, and Dina Meyer, well, proves that she can, in fact, act her way out of a paper bag.

Where Whannell goes horribly, horribly wrong is in letting one of the homages cross the line from homage to ""just downright stupid."" This is something it would be possible to laugh off, of course, except that it concerns the entire climax of the film. Can't say any more than that, but let's just say the set for the final scenes should never have resurfaced.

Once again, I find myself reviewing a Hollywood horror film-- for the third time in a month-- that had the potential to be a fantastic piece of work, and blew it in the final minutes. Unlike the others, though, Saw II stays good for a much longer portion of its length than do the others. Not great, but good. *** ",1143072000,,4184,4.676630434782608
1870124,4,B00008YOD2,"That mischievous scamp Jigsaw's back, continuing on with his own, twisted version of `You Bet Your Life' by putting people of his choosing through the grinder, forcing them to choose between life or death, the former always seeming to require some form of bodily mutilation, either to one's self or to another, while the latter generally involves a spectacularly gristly demises, guaranteeing a good time for viewers no matter which way it goes.  Co-written by Leigh Whannell (Saw) and Darren Lynn Bousman, the latter also directing here, Saw II (2005) features once New Kid on the Block singer Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense, Dreamcatcher), Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, Saw) and Shawnee Smith (Summer School, Who's Harry Crumb?), the last two actors both reprising their roles from the original film.  Also appearing is Franky G (Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (Showgirls, The Substitute), Dina Meyer (Dragonheart, Starship Troopers), Emmanuelle Vaugier (40 Days and 40 Nights), Erik Knudsen (Tribulation), and Beverley Mitchell (""7th Heaven"").

After a killer opening sequence involving a half-nekkid man fitted with a particularly nasty piece of headgear, we meet police detective Eric Mathews (Wahlberg).  Seems Eric's life isn't going all that great...he's separated from his wife, his son Daniel (Knudsen) despises him, and his career has taken something akin to a nosedive straight into the porcelain (he now rides a desk)...and things are about to go from bad to worse, as the serial killer known as Jigsaw has taken a personal interest in Eric, so much so he engages Eric in a game, one that involves his son being trapped in a dilapidated house in an undisclosed location with a bunch of social miscreants (including Amanda, from the first film, played by Ms. Smith), slowly being poisoned by some type nerve gas, while all of their activities are being fed through surveillance cameras connected to monitors within Jigsaw's lair.  In order to counteract the poison, those in the house must participate in certain challenges, as successful completion allows access to an antidote, but if you've seen the first film, you'll know said challenges most definitely involve great sacrifice (usually of one's own body part).  As Eric and Jigsaw go back and forth (a good deal of Jigsaw's past is revealed), those in the house learn that they all have something in common, that is when they aren't getting something severed off in a devious trap or puking up blood due to prolonged exposure to the nerve gas.  As time runs out, the situation within the house takes a turn for the worse (one of the group decides it's a `only the strongest survive' type situation), and things aren't looking good for Eric's son, forcing Eric to use some `old school' information extraction methods on Jigsaw to find the location of the house.  Eric finally gets Jigsaw to come clean (sort of), but then again, given his penchant for elaborately planned scenarios, it could just all be a part of the game...

First off let me just say this is one filthy, nasty, mean spirited horror film, loaded with disturbing imagery (that's about the dirtiest bathroom I've ever seen this side of the gas station down the street) and lots of blood and pain (and blood).  Is it the nastiest piece of work I've seen?  Not by a long shot, but it definitely holds it own.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was an excellent example of what a sequel should be for this type of film, one that not only expands on the original, but also reveals a good deal of information with regards to the main, connecting character, that being Jigsaw, played most excellently by Tobin Bell.  We learn his name, his past, and the motivation behind why he does what he does...and I have to say, in listening to him, his reasoning doesn't seem all that far-fetched, as many people do take that which is most precious to them, their lives, for granted, not fully appreciating what they have until they're forced to face their own mortality (having your head stuck in a bear trap set to a timer will certainly go far in helping you reevaluate your life choices).  But then again, it is our unalienable right to disregard our gifts and live a life of slovenly leisure should we choose to do so...but I digress.  As far as the performances go, I thought most did well enough (I found Eric's son to be an annoying little prat) considering there wasn't really enough time to spend on any one character given the number of them running around combined with the film's seemingly short running time (it says 93 minutes, but it felt more like about an hour and twenty minutes).  The real fun here is the various traps, as Jigsaw continues his grand, social experimentation, `testing the fabric of human nature'...the opening sequence, featuring a vicious head trap (slightly different than the one featured in the first film), is worth it alone for seeing this film, as it's about the most tense five minutes I've spent with a movie in a while.  If'n you're squeamish about needles, you've got a real treat in store for you here...also, that suspended hand trapping device was particularly nasty, although I have to say, the person who fell for it was none to bright.  Seemed to me a normal person would have figured out the danger after putting one hand in, and would have opted against inserting the second, but, when you're doped up silly on nerve gas, who's to say what one might do?  As far as the direction of the film, Darren Lynn Bousman doesn't seem to have the overall smooth finesse of James Wan (who directed the first film), but he definitely knows what he's doing, and he does it very well (what's really impressive is this was his first, big feature).  Bousman keeps things moving along at a frantic pace, barely allowing for one to catch one's breath.  My only real misgiving about this film was at the end...there's a decent revelation that comes about, followed by an overly lengthy recap sequence where we get to rewatch all the stinking clues dropped throughout the film, perhaps in an effort to strengthen (or help explain) the revelation itself.  This isn't an uncommon device, one that I feel sort of suggests the filmmaker feels their audiences are none too bright.  Problem is here (for me, at least), it wasn't really necessary, was way too long, and served only to eat up screen time.  All in all, if you liked the first one, then you'll most likely dig this follow up.

The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1), looks excellent, and the audio, available in both Dolby 2.0 Surround and 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Plus comes through perfectly.  As far as extras, there's a audio commentary track with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actors Donnie Wahlberg and Beverley Mitchell, three featurettes titled `Bits and Pieces - The Props of Jigsaw' (4:35), `Jigsaw's Game' (2:58), and `The Traps of Saw II', which is made up of four parts, each discussing a particular trap.  Also included are storyboards and a conceptual art gallery, English and Spanish subtitles, a theatrical trailer for the film, along with advertisements/trailers for other Lion's Gate DVD releases like the special edition Saw 2 DVD set, Three... Extremes (2004), Audition (1999), Ultimate Avengers (2006), and Tamara (2005).

The key players are still in the film, but it's just too far fetched for its own good.  Nor are the scenes as grahpic as the first. I also found the house where the victims were held not creepy enough, whereas in the first film, the old industrial toilet was intensely creepy.

SAW 2 failed also because I did not care about the characters.  I just wanted the film to end.

1870157,5,B00008YOD2,"In this sequel, we get to see more creatively twisted scenarios created by Jigsaw.  This time Jigsaw, played wonderfully by Tobin Bell, gets the cops by the balls when they come to capture him.  He is no longer able to flee and he has set up one of his finest and most brilliant ""scenarios"" elsewhere.

We get to see much more of Jigsaw this time around, allowing us to get a true feel for what he is doing, and why.  We are granted insight into his personal situation and his frame of mind.  Jigsaw uses peoples' ""dirty laundry"" to entrap them and fuel their desire to live, as he did in the first.  He believes, given his experiences, that those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life.

The movie is interesting, twisted and creative - and it follows up on the first movie very well.  You even get to briefly revisit the scene from the first movie, which was a great added touch.  The twist near the end of the movie is unexpected and clever.  I doubt that I would be as interested to see a third installment into the series, but this one was certainly solid.

The bonus features are also quite interesting.  You get to see how Jigsaw's traps were created and put into action for the film.  There is also a cool featurette highlighting the props used in the movie.

In comparison with SawI, SawII is both a failure as well as a success. It's a failure in the sense that though it has a number of horrific shocking moments like SawI, they are far less effective than the ones in SawI. And it's a success because it's significantly more complicated and thus, in a sense, more intelligent than SawI. However, overall it's not as impressive and as memorable as its predecessor.

They seemed more focused on getting the viewer to get sick or puke, rather than making them crap their pants out of terror.  I still bought it and have no regrets about doing so, but would have liked to see a more scary horror movie.  All in all, I would probably give it 3-1/2 stars, still a keeper if just for the torture devices they come up with.  Very creative, but no match for the first one.",1142208000,,662,4.214285714285714

Eight people are trapped in a room with a deadly gas in the air. One of those people happens to be Detective Matthews son. This is a great intense movie with a lot of suspense. My favorite part of the movie probably is when Matthews just beats the crap out of Jigsaw to get information on where his son his. Everyone plays a good role in the film. I thought the first Saw was amazing. This one is also great and keeps building up. Man this is becoming a great trilogy. One of my favorites for sure.

1870162,2,B00008YOD2,"The original Saw was great in concept, mediocre in execution, so I wasn't expecting much here. And ""not much"" is what I got. What we have here is a ponderous, top-heavy slasher film that's too busy trying to find a forumla in the original Saw and follow it to find any real footing, or an identity of its own. One thing Saw had going for it was somewhat engrossing characters. Saw II contains your average roster of vaguely developed trap fodder who predictably start lashing out at one-another before dying telegraphed deaths.

 The lead girl Amanda, once a somewhat believable jittery addict, is now of a rather cardboard stoic nature. I assume I was supposed to care about Eric's son, but he might as well have been a secondary character. The most developed character was the ""Jigsaw killer"" himself, and you can trick anyone into thinking a character has depth if they have a terminal illness.

What have we left... Oh yes, the ending. Saw II has one of the most convoluted, contrived endings I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. It's as forced as a pineapple in a paper shredder, and makes about as much sense as that prospect. Hm, that's it. Pretty dull.

Cast:  Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverly Mitchell, Erik Knudsen.

Running Time:  93 minutes

Rated R for grisly violence and gore, terror, language and drug content.

Sequels, with a few exceptions, have a tendency to be very bad. In the wake of all this being let down by them, many critics were initially unimpressed with the idea of a clever little horror film like ""Saw"" to have a sequel. It seemed like too much of a way to cash in a successful revenue and good reception of the original and while this one isn't as good it is a formidable continuation.  ""Saw II"" does everything wrong that the first film did right. First of all, this film tells the story of a group of eight random people inside one of Jigsaw's ""Fun houses"", if you will, with a dangerous nerve gas slowly creeping into their systems. They only have 3 hours to find a way out, or they all die. Now, what made the first film great is that it built tension and suspense on the fact that everything was a mystery. The two men locked inside of a bathroom had no more of an idea of what was going on than the people watching the film. As the film went on, there was a little more information leaked, a little more progression with each minute that ticked by. And the fact that there were only two people instead of eight made it easier to know the characters, know why they were doing what they were doing, etc. Instead, ""Saw II"" is just basically a glorified theatrical version of ""Survivor"" with blood, guts, and gore.

The first film also didn't reveal much of the surrounding environments outside of the bathroom. That's what made it scary; you didn't know who or what was watching them, why they were in there, or even if there was any hope that they would get out. In Saw II, a police team actually captures jigsaw (Tobin Bell), and throughout the film, there are cuts to detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), who must investigate the crime scene in order to save his own son, who happens to be trapped with the several others at the unknown location, about to be killed by the deathly gas.  Everything is just so silly when compared to the first film. It's like Leigh Whannel completely let his film go the way of ""quick cash-in"", and if he had a little more input on this film, I think it could have been much better.  Saw II does do some things right, such as the way people die and nailing the violence factor right on the head. There is plenty of gore in this film, and some of the twisted things the people have to do are pretty insane (seeing a girl crawl around in a pool of syringes is terrifying). But, the violence isn't handled well. Violence isn't something that is supposed to be there just to be there. It should have a purpose (such as scaring audiences!).  What director Darren Lynn Bousman and screenwriter Leigh Whannell (who wrote the first ""Saw"") attempt to do is create a scenario similar to the excellent ""The Cube"" and create a villain as menacing as Jon Doe in ""Seven""; however, they fail to do either and ""Saw II"", despite its redeeming qualities, becomes an overly grisly, horrifically gory tale that isn't all that surprising or entertaining.",1142121600,4,3257,4.5487179487179485
1870164,5,B00008YOD2,"As true to the horror genre as the first 'SAW', 'SAW II' brings us back to the bloody depths of Jigsaw's intriguing games and puzzles, where blood is the price you pay for not playing by the rules.  I am as pleased with this sequel as I was with the original, bringing blood and horror back to horror where it belongs.  Hopefully, 'SAW III' will rise from the ashes of this grisly phoenix to entertain horror aficionados again.

Detective Eric Matthews has cornered and caught John (Tobin Bell) the jigsaw killer.  Or has he?  When John tells Matthews another game is in progress, and shows Matthews footage that his son has been recruited for the game, Matthews is forced into Jigsaw's nightmare of trying to unravel the clues.

The trap?  Several people are locked inside a dilapidated old house.  (The atmosphere of the house is sinister and disturbing, but not as filthy as the bathroom in the original.)  The doors to the house will open in three hours, but the players are already breathing in a poison gas that will kill them within two hours.  The players include Matthews' son Daniel (Erik Knudson) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who previously escaped one of Jigsaw's traps and is forced to play again.  John's tape informs them that there are antidotes hidden throughout the house, one of which is in the safe in the middle of the room they are in.  He tells them they all possess the combination to the safe; that the numbers are in the back of their mind.  Once they figure out what they all have in common, they will know why they are there.  X marks the spot (again).  Let the game begin.

Amanda tries to warn her fellow players that she has dealt with Jigsaw's traps before, and that they must follow the rules, but the fear of death and the clash of personalities have the players all running for their own lives.  Needless to say, the house has many lovely traps awaiting our game-players.  We get to observe not only the players desperate struggle to survive, but witness Detective Matthews degeneration into his own madness as he struggles with John's mental games in order to save his son's life.

Without the 'whodunit' value of the original 'SAW', the surprise in 'SAW II' comes strictly from the clues of the game, not a 'whodunit' but 'what was the most important clue'?  It is still a puzzle for the viewer to solve, and I will go no further on revealing any hints.  Suffice to say, pay attention, and get ready to be shocked, stunned, grossed out, and gagging with exquisite horror and delight as the blood begins to flow.  Watch for the peek at the original bathroom.

I must add, I have never felt so drawn to a psychopathic killer in my life as I am to John.  I would kiss Jigsaw's cancer-withered lips and toes if I could find him.  I just hope he doesn't find me first.

One more quick note.  When I saw Donnie Wahlberg in 'The Sixth Sense', I wondered how an awful ex-pop singer (the word singer used loosely) could turn into such a great actor.  While his performance in 'The Sixth Sense' was superior, he plays his role as Detective Matthews quite skillfully.  Kudos also to Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith.

If you loved 'SAW', you are going to love 'SAW II'.  If you love blood, guts, building terror, violent deaths, desperately selfish personalities, and cunning killers, this movie is for you.  Definitely a 'buy', 10 stars.  Enjoy!",1142121600,13,3367,4.595637583892618
1870165,4,B00008YOD2,"i was really excited to see this movie after watching the first one several times, however i did not think i would like it.  But i loved it.  It starts off with a guy stuck in a face trap to mirror the jaw trap from the first one. There is a face plate with rusted nails inside that will snap on his face if he doesnt find the key in time.  But the key is inside his eye. Not being able to take out his eye for the key, it snaps shut on him, killing him.  When the investigators find him, they also discover a message that says ""look closer"" to the detective. They soon find jigsaw killer, but he is not able to do much of anything anymore, due to the cancer he has that we found out aobut in the first movie.  But the detective soon discovers monitors which show 8 or 9 people trapped in a house full of traps, his son being one of them.  All the people in the house are connected somehow, and you find out something about the detective as well.  Amanda is also trapped in the house.  For those of you who don't remember, amanda was the girl from the first one that survived the jaw trap.  Soon they all begin to go crazy, and the deaths are much worse than the ones from the first one.  The scene that made me cringe the most was the one involving the pit of needles.  The ending is amazing with several differnt twists. I predicted the main twist about 3 seconds before it was revealed.

The title of this film (just like the original) gives the impression that you might be in for a gratuitous gore fest. While there are some graphic scenes, this movie, like its predecessor, is much more of a CSI/Law and Order crime thriller than a go-for-the-grossout flick.

It's a seeSAW story that flips back and forth between a group of kidnapped hoodlums being held in a gloomy, booby-trap filled house and the detective (plus team) trying to find them. There are good twists and turns in the story: Why has the group been kidnapped? What do they all have in common? What do they have in common with the cops that are looking for them? Will any of the kidnapped crew escape? Is there a definitive tie-in with the first movie? All ultimately revealed in this B-actor filled second edition of the Jigsaw killer chronicles.

The B-actors selectively put in some pretty good performances. Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Mathews), Shawnee Smith (Amanda) and Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) are great. Franky G (Xavier) is fairly believable at best and the other kidnapees are standard B appearances.

There are also some police-work plot holes/believability issues that take some of the realistic desperation away from Saw II. I'd elaborate, but the explanations would take away some of the surprises.

So, all in all, I'd say....See Saw. It's certainly worth renting, but not worthy of the original release's collector status.",1141603200,,1546,5.119047619047619
1870206,2,B00008YOD2,"Like everyone else who liked Saw, I was looking forward to the sequel continuing on the legacy of clever traps, tension and gore that made the first in the series so enjoyable. Instead, it looks like the script writer bit off more than he could chew and the overall feel of the movie became contrived and, at times, laughable.

The whole movie would have benefitted from a reduction of about half of the cast. It was obvious they were intended to be nothing more than bait, but there were way too many times I would watch a character blithely wander along into a trap when just one second of thought would have been enough to figure out how to avoid it. Clearly, the writer was more concerned about showing off props instead of making sure that the characters were at least slightly believable. Luckily enough the traps were interesting and I could still find something to make me keep going to the end.

The plot ending was similarly weak. I had it figured out halfway through the movie when only a few characters didn't seem to be feeling the effects of the gas (not to mention that a serial killer who was presumably pushing around safes and hauling heavy equipment could barely hold up an empty plastic cup). The ending was neither scary nor interesting, just a cheap and very corporate segue to the next movie in the series. If Saw II flowed more naturally, or had at least some attempt at characterization, maybe the whole thing could have been more natural and rewarding.

It wasn't all bad here. Donnie's performance as a cop was shallow but honestly given. I was looking for a little more detective work, but I had no other real complaints considering the movie genre. Jigsaw was fine as a cinematic serial killer, and at least his philosophy never really changed.

As mentioned before the traps and the sets were cool and salvaged what was left of the tense atmosphere. The first Saw broke up the trap sections by using the Pig's head character for some old-fashioned suspense. Adding scenes like these to Saw II to vary things a little would have taken some of the burden off of the traps, making them more of a great addition to the movie instead of its only saving grace.

Maybe I was watching this with expectations too high? I don't think so, the movie just never delivered. Here's hoping for a better outing in Saw III.",1141516800,3,2335,4.576555023923445
1870207,1,B00008YOD2,"Saw I had promise and and descended in to a plot mess. Saw II is absurd and not even scary. The basic problem is twofold: 1)Jigsaw as a serial killer is no Hannibal Lector--in fact you almost feel sorry for the poor bastard as Wahlberg beats the crap out of him 2)Killing a bunch of ex-cons does not evoke much empathy. Additionally the ""clever"" trick ending renders the entire movie and plot as absurd and trite.  The basic idea behind both of these movies could have provided for some real scares but instead we are treated to a poorly written convulted plot structure that is not even close to being believable.  The best serial killer films are very basic and raw--Saw II like Saw I bites off more than it can chew. A waste........",1141516800,3,735,4.477611940298507
1870208,5,B00008YOD2,"Saw was and still is an amazing movie, and to me there is no movie killer more genius than Jigsaw, with the exception of Hannibal, of course. His unique traps and his twisted altruism just attracts you to his character. It's virtually impossible to hate this man, especially after the twist in the last movie. Not only that, but he's capable of fulfilling that old saying ""Fool me once..."" blah blah. Saw II is the ""fool me twice"" part of that saying.

Though since Saw ended by revealing the identity of the killer known as Jigsaw, Saw II obviously had to go in another direction. And surprisingly, the twists in this one are as convincing as they were in the last one. It's just difficult to talk about them in the review without spoiling the movie. So I'll say this straight off: If you loved Saw then there is absolutely no reason why you can't love this. And if you hated Saw, perhaps because of the gore, then obviously stay away. Saw II did everything good (depending on your interpretation of ""good"") that the first movie did and adds some.

Since good horror films are so sparse (is this even a horror film, or a suspense/thriller), I can't recommend this movie enough. Saw II achieves what only the best horror movies are able to achieve. It gets into your skin. You'll jump, you'll turn your head, you may even gag once or twice, but either way you feel the effects of this movie.",1141344000,,1391,4.4940711462450595

1870210,5,B00008YOD2,"""Oh, yes...there will be blood,"" Jigsaw informs us.  You know what?  He's right.  A police detective finds that a serial killer has his son.  He has placed the boy into a house full of ""tests"" with a group of hardcore criminals.  Just to make sure there is enough pressure, he has filled the house with a slow acting nerve agent that will kill the occupants if they stay in the house to long.  There are anecdotes but the participants have to pass a series of tests designed to make them face their crimes against humanity to find them.  Yeah, that sounds like a good time for all concerned.

There are plenty of twists and turns in this one.  I thought I had it figured out no less than six times and was wrong to the very end.

Here's the thing, you expect it to be gory, but what you don't expect is the way it gets under your skin.  It is psychologically disturbing on a level I only wish I could attain in my own creative endeavors.  It is a sneaky kind of scary, the kind that you don't notice while you are watching the movie.  No, it waits until you are alone with your thoughts and haunts you mercilessly.  Luckily, the effects aren't lasting.  Once you realize what is causing your...discomfort, you can easily (relatively) shrug it off and move on.  I haven't watched a movie that truly got to me since I was a child.  I now own this one.

It is a rare event when a sequel meets or exceeds the quality of the original, but I have to say this one fits the bill.  I intended to watch them both back to back at some point in the near future.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror.  Hell, I recommend it to anyone who isn't, if nothing else just for the experience of it.",1141257600,,1704,4.197530864197531

The story twists and turns at every corner to the point where you think just about anything could happen.  The acting was great and full of known actors.  I don't quite understand the poing of Beverly Mitchell who is a decent name in acting and plays such a useless role in the film.  The DVD extras on this film are well worth getting the DVD.

1870235,4,B00008YOD2,"I thought Saw (the original) was brilliant.  It jumped from game to game, and kept you guessing as to what was happening and who was behind it all.  Saw II was different in that there was basically one main plot through the whole movie: Jigsaw kidnaps a cop's kid in order to play a game with the cop.  There are others invovled in the game and there are traps along the way, which were pretty gruesome, but not as shocking as the original.  Saw isn't supposed to have a real plot, and I think trying to keep this single trap going paralleling the fairly predictable plot line made the movie sort of boring at times.  It was an ok movie, just not as shocking and fast-paced as the original.  Definitely left an opening for Saw III, so we will see if Bousman/Lions Gate can redeem themselves.",1140912000,,791,4.383561643835616
1870236,4,B00008YOD2,"Saw II takes a much different approach to the victims of Jigsaw than did the first film.  In the first film, the viewer was basically just as trapped as the two men in the bathroom.  We had no idea what was actually going on, and the only way it was revealed to us was through flashbacks.  Toward the end of the film, we were given an outside perspective from a couple of different characters, but the majority of the film was limited to what was going on between Adam and Dr. Gordon in the bathroom, and that was what made the film great.

Saw II tries a different approach.  The movie begins with the apprehension of the Jigsaw killer, but he has one last game to play with the arresting detective.  Jigsaw has kidnapped his son and put him in a locked down house with 7 other people, releasing a deadly gas through the ventilation system.  That is the game the captives have to play.  Each of them has a room with an antidote, and a sick game the victim has to play to retrieve the antidote.  Regretfully, we don't get to see all of the rooms and all of the sick games that Jigsaw has set up, we only get 3 or 4 glimpses of the sick, depraved torture methods he has set up.  The movie takes place equally from the viewpoint of those inside the trap, and the detective interrogating Jigsaw in his hideout, while watching what is occurring in the house on video monitors.

I wouldn't really call Saw II a ""horror"" film.  Yes, it has a lot of gore, and there are a couple moments that make you jump, but it is definitely not a scary film.  It is, however, a very entertaining film, and a worthy follow-up to the first film, which I enjoyed immensely.  The second film also tries to pull a huge twist at the end, and, while it isn't as big of a shocker as the original, the twist is still pretty good and leaves the viewer scratching their head.  Although I would argue that the twist in this movie is much more plausible than the twist from the original, and maybe that is why it isn't quite as good.

Bottom line, if you enjoyed Saw, you will definitely like the sequel.  A lot of the people I know who liked Saw think this one is better, I don't agree, but I still think this is a pretty good film that is worth watching at least a couple times to try to catch all the stuff that is happening.

What seems to scare people more than fake scary movies or make believe characters are people that are real and stories that feel even realer. In Saw it feels more possible for this to be done and this creates more fear and more thinking than you would get from a traditional scary movie. If you ask me Saw 2 is just as good as the first with the same intelligent but sadistic games. It's so good that you even start to get the message that trying to be passed by Jigsaw.

1870292,2,B00008YOD2,A long time ago there was a movie called Seven that was clever and disturbing beautifully made and had riveting performances. Those days are long gone. Now we get horror movies hurriedly slopped together for a quick buck. The filmmakers think up a few nice twists for the ending and pad out the rest of the movie with a bunch of jerks wandering around a house falling into various deathtraps like idiots. As a fan of the glory days of 70s low budget horror films I have to say there's nothing all that shocking here despite some really annoying flashy editing gimmicks that dilute the effect of gruesome scenes. The cast is unlikable and the killer mastermind practically catatonic(imagine Christopher Walken in his place...that would've been creepy)so there's little to hold your interest between predictable death scenes. Good twist at the end but not as good as the orginal and a good horror  film should have more to offer than a climatic surprise to be truly scary.,1140739200,,970,4.808383233532934
1870293,4,B00008YOD2,"Visceral.  Sadistic.  Incredible.  Effectively horrifying.  These all apply to this bloody remake to the popular SAW.  Only Shawnee Smith as Amanda, Tobin Bell as Jigsaw and Dina Meyer as the detective return from the original, but the bloodletting continues and the game seems to have the same rules.  Perhaps another actor than Donnie Wahlberg would have been more convincing, but even he manages to pull his role off.  The premise of the eight people being held hostage in an abandoned house, all doomed to die unless they succeed in playing Jigsaw's game, is nothing new; it all started similarly with TEN LITTLE INDIANS and has continued on since.

The movie has its shocking moments, some scenes almost too painful to really watch.  The acting is effective, but no real standouts.  Franky G is playing the same role he always plays and Glenn Plummer does his requisite bad boyz persona.  Bell is lethally chilling as Jigsaw, and since we know SAW III is coming out later this year, you won't be too surprised at the ending.",1140652800,,1029,4.822857142857143

Centered around a cop ( played by Donnie Wahlberg) who Jigsaw has targeted and is the common link between the people Jigsaw ( John ) has locked up in a room in an abandoned house, the movie delivers alot more than the original. The fact that Jigsaw has several more victims in this movie makes it much more interesting. We see Jigsaw who is dying of cancer and very bitter, still wanting to teach people the meaning and value of life. This movie like the first, forces people to see exactly what they would do to save their own life. With each victim's dying scene, it makes you wonder what WE would actually do to save our life. There was good acting in this movie and alot more action. Of course, with a surprise ending, it looks like there will be a Saw III in the works.

1870298,4,B00008YOD2,"""Saw 2"" is the horror/suspense sequel to this original low-budget film that thrilled audiences back in the summer of 2004 due to its clever plot and insane killer. In the second movie, Tobin Bell reprises his role as the Jigsaw Killer and remains just as creepy as he was in the first. This time, he has managed to trap 8 unsuspecting victims in a funhouse of traps that he has designed for the players to saunter through. Meanwhile, the father of one victim is a detective who has found Jigsaw but now has to play the game in hope to keep his son alive in the house.

I have spoken to a number of people who liked ""Saw 2"" better than its predecessor, and at first I agreed. However, the one thing that differentiates the two is that the sequel lacks the ""rewatchability factor"" that the first had. I have seen ""Saw 2"" three times already, and after the first time, I thought it was better than the first, after the second I thought it was equal to ""Saw"" but not better, and after my most recent viewing, I felt like the first was far superior. Don't get me wrong, ""Saw 2"" delivers on what it promises and is a highly entertaining film, but I feel like it is one of those movies that you love the first time but can never enjoy as much again. I will just mention the pluses and minuses of the movie.

Negatives:

-There are more characters in this one which means you don't learn as much about them as the main two guys in ""Saw""

-The movie isn't as creepy, dark, and suspenseful as the first, and lacks those ""Jump in your seat"" scary moments

-The main thing that has bothered me about the movie is that I feel like they could have done more with the traps in this movie. The first ""Saw"" became so popular mainly because the trap scenes were so gruesome and superbly invented that it added so much to the film. This time, I enjoyed the traps that were there, but I felt like there should have been more. Jigsaw presumably sets up traps for each of the ""contestants"" (with the possible exception of one), but we only see three of the traps come into play. I would have loved to have seen what was in store for the rest of the group and I can't help but wonder how much better the movie could have been with a few more insanely clever trap scenes.

Positives:

-The extra characters, while meaning we know less about each of them, provide an amazingly well intertwined plot which adds to the film. Also, I liked the fact that they got to roam an entire house instead of being confined to one room, as it gave you the sense of not knowing what was around each corner.

-Tobin Bell is great. He remains the highlight of the movie, with his steely demeanor and creepy voice.

-Erik Knudsen provides a very good performance as the young son trapped in the house, and manages to be the main person you are pulling for to survive when watching.

-The ending was fantastic (assuming you saw the first movie and understand it). This is what made me originally think this movie was better than the first. It was chilling and left you wanting more while also linking the movie with the first ""Saw."" The only problem is that the ""Oh my God"" ending doesn't set up well for repeated viewings...unless you are watching it with other people who haven't seen it yet and can enjoy their reactions.

Overall, the movie was solid, and I think it lives up to the first. If you enjoyed the first then I highly recommend this one, and can't wait to see what is in store for ""Saw 3"" come late October 2006!",1140566400,2,3483,4.334869431643625
1870299,3,B00008YOD2,"I guess I'm just weird cause I really think this movie is a major step down from the original.  Sure, I'd anticipate that the foolish masses to think that this was equal to or better thant he original; they might think anything.  But there are plenty of people out there whose opinions I respect who think that this film was pretty much a lateral move, and I don't quite get that.  So again, maybe I'm just strange.  And I'm not as in love with the original as some people are, mind you; I like it a helluva lot, and actually appreciate a lot more after seeing the sequel, but it's certainly got some flaws.  People always accuse sequels of being pale imitations of the original, and nowhere is that more true than here.  It's watchable enough, for sure, but it lacks the sorta novelty of the original, and the clever, interesting plot.  I'm not gonna tell ya that the plot for the original was terribly plausible, but it was very compelling, I felt, and just had a sort of continuity to it that 'Saw II' lacks.  That and it just contained a kinda central mystery as to just what the hell is going on, but here we already know the basics, and the connection between the characters in the room here proves to be fairly mundane and obvious.  Here we're just basically waiting for them to get on with it.  In 'Saw II' they basically stuff 8 or so people in a room and have them bicker and kill themselves in the traps while Donnie Wahlberg yells and yells and yells across town.  To be perfectly blunt, this is just too much for me to take it entirely seriously no matter how well it might be done.  First of all, Wahlberg tends to be way, way over the top.  People complained about the acting in the original, but he's a bigger problem here then anyone was there.  Also, this time around Jigsaw has just got a rather enormous funhouse of death, and it's all a bit too elaborate and comes across a bit silly much of the time.  There's just so much there, so many wacky traps and whatnot.  Some of these individual scenarios are pretty damn neat, I'll admit, though they occasionally feel like parody and just generally aren't as interesting as the ones in the original. (And certainly none of them can match the jaw trap from the original film.)  The one chick, Amanda, being dumped in the pile of discarded hypodermic needles is definitely the best.  Ouch.

Furthermore, the new director just doesn't the sort of handle on the material that Wan had.  Darren Lynn Bousman seems like he's trying to hard to just imitate the style of the original, and most of the flashy, music-video style stuff just comes off as silly and overwrought.  (This happened some in the original as well, actually, but it was more contained and effective in general.)  The style of the original was derivative, but you get the idea that they were making it that way because that's how they wanted it to be.  Ya get the feeling that Bousman made the film this way because that's how it was supposed to be, and it just doesn't generate the same atmosphere.

The film hinges on a final plot twist which I must admit is fairly clever.  Again, it's not terribly likely, but whaddya expect in this kinda movie.  It was amusing enough.  That goes for the film as a whole, but don't be expecting something too cohesive.

1870300,4,B00008YOD2,"In 2004 actor-writer Leigh Whannel and firsttime director James Wan released a low-budget horror-thriller called Saw. The film made decent box-office and soon a sequel was greenlighted to take advantage of the new franchise while horror movies were hot. This time around Whannel has a different newcomer to direct Saw II. Darren Lynn Bousman was tapped to make sense of Leigh Whannel's script for the sequel. Once again, Whannel's talent in writing credible and non-cheesy dialogue is average at best and pretty so-so most of the time. The acting was serviceable and pretty decent for a horror flick. Most of the time acting's usually not the highest of priorities in such films. As long as the actors show a decent amount of talent on the screen then everything else they do is gravy.

Once more the film takes the premise of a sort of demented gamemaster calling himself Jigsaw (again Tobin Bell plays the role with relish and aplomb) who takes individuals he's deemed as not worthy of the lives their leading and puts them in complex and demented games where there's only two options: live or die and the choice is up always up to the contestant. This time around Jigsaw has chosen eight people who at first has nothing in common with each other but as the story moves forward one thing ties them all together. A slow-acting nerve gas has been seeping into their boarded up room and they have two hours to solve puzzles that will give them acess to the antidote needed to counteract the nerve-agent. The twist this time around is that each puzzle also has a trap attached to it and sometimes solving the puzzle means having to shed blood. Blood that is either the participants or a bystander's. The gruesome traps range from hidden blades in glass boxes, an industrial furnace, a pit of used needles, etc... The pit of needles still give chills whenever I think about it.

To add to this maze of traps and puzzles, Jigsaw also involves an outside character played by Donnie Wahlberg. Wahlberg's character is a burnt-out cop who has everything to lose if he doesn't play Jigsaw's game and his choice on how to play the game results in a twist at the end that wasn't easily seen and predicted. The twist in the end of Saw II was cleverly pulled off and added more to the demented genius that the Jigsaw character gives off. This character is fast joining the classic ranks of horror villains like Hannibal Lecter, Freddie, Michael Myers and Jason. I actually think he's one-upped the character of John Doe from Fincher's Seven. It helps that Tobin Bell has again put in another chilling performance as Jigsaw.

Saw II delivers on everything that the first film had and improves on it with better pacing and tighter direction from Darren Lynn Bousman. With a bigger budget and more space to work with (an entire two story house instead of a single showerroom), Saw II added more action in addition to ramping up the disturbing scens of gore and deaths. Each death doesn't have the carnival glee that the Final Destination films have. Instead each death is meant to disturb and induce cringes and winces from its audience. The clever ending leaves for a second sequel to be made and I for one wouldn't mind visiting with Jigsaw and company one more time.",1140480000,3,3253,4.703508771929824

The movie was so unmarked, it hadn't been done, and the idea of the killer not actually killing his victims but letting them kill them self's while playing his sick twist games.

The sequel isn't as good as the first but they usually aren't, I feel the sequel is good enough to be able to stand on its as a good rated movie. This movie has a lot more death and a wider span of area than the first film, as I feel they had a lot more money for the sequel it-self. If you like these types of films e.g. Seven  you're deafly find this type of horror a interesting mind-blowing experience.

** 1/2

Reprising the original this returns to the world of Jigsaw and some fresh victims. As per normal, rather than rehash plotline I'll focus on my thoughts on this film.

The suspense just isn't there. Throughout most of the film I never felt pulled in. Sure in a couple of the bloody scenes I winced a bit. However, the emotional rollercoaster isn't there.

Amanda: early on I knew something was up with her. She knew too much and acted too out of place with the other misfortunate souls. You knew something was coming. The end wasn't much of a surprise.

The first 80% of the film I almost felt as if I was watching CSI. It felt like that in set up and presentation. Only in the end does it breakout and get some flair to it.

Bloody it is. Seeing the venus flytrap again was nice. The torching of the one victim in the boiler one could see that one coming a mile away. I did though like the one girl getting her hands stuck in the glass box. That was brutal.

Donnie Wahberg puts in a decent performace as a corrupt cop who in the end well, gets a surprse.

It struck me as interesting with windows around the house. No one went for one.

I liked the tie in with the original movie that we arrived back in the same nasty basement room.

Is this worth a purchase? No. I suggest renting it. Its nowhere near as cerebral or twisty as the original. It is worth seeing though to see where the world of Jigsaw goes since we know he ain't long for this world.",1140480000,,1468,4.192170818505338

- John tells Eric how he gets jiggy in ""Saw II""

Lackluster sequel to the 2004 original, has nothing new to add & basically feels like a derivitive video game for the X Box 360, PS 2 crowd.

A new detective is thrown on the case of ""The Jigsaw"" murders & as usual, Jigsaw himself figures out who this new cop is & wants to play a deadly game with him.

This time a group of felons, the cop had underhandly put away in the past, are kidnapped & locked in an abandoned house filled with jigsaw traps. The group must come together to overcome & survive their stay. Whats worse, is they only have two hours to escape since their is a toxic nerve agent slowly being pumped into the house that, without a cure, will turn them into a bloody soup (the cure is, supposedly locked in a huge safe. Get the combination to the safe, will get you the cure.)

""Oh yes, their will be blood.""

Adding insult to injury the detective's son is among the group, & it's just a matter of time before the felons find out why he is among them. If the detective plays Jigsaw's game, his son will live, but, with a very short temper it's just a matter of time before the detective snaps.

""Saw II"" was immediately green lit after the first successful weekend of the original in October of '04.

The film was put into rush mode since it had just under a year for completion & release.

""Saw II"" has no real thrills to it. The characters are cardboard & a lot of what went on the house could have been handled differently, or avoided altogether. The film is way to predictable.

Donnie Wahlberg's character is probably one of the worst detectives in film history. If he kept his cool the film would have been better for it. Shawnee Smith's character was just lame & the ending was total bulls**t.

The only time ""Saw II"" comes alive is when Tobin Bell is onscreen & thats only, roughly ten to fifteen minutes of screentime. It was a bit interesting to see the origin of Jigsaw. Bell gives a creepy vibe to the character.

I was expecting a bit more from ""Saw II"", but, I should have known better.

1870335,3,B00008YOD2,"Most fans of Saw one will admit that the sequel wasn't as good as the first but most horror fans will also admit that it is one of the better sequels to come out for a horror film than most we have seen.

Saw 2 finds actually a very clever way to connect both part one and two together by bringing back a woman from part one who survived. She is supposed to be there to help the rest who are new to the twisted game of Jigsaw's. There is ending scene as well in the movie that connects one and two in another way that I won't spoil but will answer all your questions you had for the two unfortunates in the first film.

So yes the writing is in ways strong and keep you there in front of the screen. It does keep you caring about what will happen and you pray the main character's son that is one of the new players of Jigsaw's game survives. Also what makes this movie worth watching is the fact that you finally get to know the mysterious Jigsaw a lot better than you ever did know and he becomes less ominous- feeling than he was in the first and just...a sick (both mentally and physically) person that hasn't been caught yet.

The characters are strong-ish. There are just too many characters I feel in this movie, so there isn't enough time for any of them to be too strong. The only ones that truly stood out was the boy, mainly because the main character is his father and trying to save him, and the survivor of the first movie who knows a little too much- I felt. Then of course Jigsaw. The film was sort of messy though because there shouldn't have been that many characters.

Part one I felt was stronger in this case because there were less characters so thus they had a chance to grow into stronger personalities as the movie rolled on. And also Jigsaw having an ominous feel just made part one a lot more creepy than the second. The writing in the first was also more stronger just cause again less characters. But in both endings, I was surprised. I have to admit that. Both endings I didn't even think about till they were played.

So overall this was a good follow- up to the Saw part one, but it doesn't match up to the strength of part one either. I highly recommend part one and also this one just because in part two they add a little more to the story everyone who liked Saw 1 should know.",1140393600,,2312,4.186516853932584

 He would be able to single out anyone and teach them to appreciate their lives ... threw hellish games in side their own minds !

1870338,3,B00008YOD2,"Saw was a horror film with a good storyline and an excellent twist at the end. Saw II, however, doesn't come close to the original.

The sequel introduces a new character Eric Matthews, played by former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg, a cop with a grudge who has just had a falling out with his son. Jigsaw attacks once again and this time it's Matthew's son who's in the torture chamber with a group of convicts that Matthews put away.

Unlike the original, the script for Saw II seems like it wasn't revised enough. The characters aren't given much background study even though Jigsaw is finally introduced as an old man dying of cancer, but the torture scenes, especially the one at the beginning of the film, are horrific.

Fans of the original and horror films in general might find Saw II quite entertaining. But the film's staleness and silly character buildup makes the original much more entertaining.

Mildly recommended

1870339,4,B00008YOD2,"The first one was an original gorefest but I think this one is a bit better. The acting in the first wasn't that good at all and I think this one is superior in that way. Plus the plot is better, you just don't have 2 guys giving bad performances while being  stuck in a room together. You have a few people giving bad performances stuck in a gory maze of pain and punishment instead lol. Although they're certainly better than how bad Cary Elwes was in the original.

  This one is about how Jigsaw has it out for a detective played by Donnie Wahlberg. So he takes his son and puts him in a house full of traps with some other poor souls. Wahlberg and other cops have Jigsaw caught but he still holds all the cards. Tobin Bell (24 season 2, Saw) is brilliant as Jigsaw and he doesn't get any credit for that. Shawnee Smith returns as Amanda who escaped Jigsaw's crazy games once before and is now stuck in a trap once again. Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers) is in the cast from the first but I don't remember her. Anyway she's a cop who gets Wahlberg to join her in pursuit of Jigsaw. She also gives one of the better performances next to Bell. Who knows maybe she'll even be back for the already in production 3rd gorefest Saw 3. The end of the movie is like the first one all over again but it still manages to be a pretty clever way to end it.

All I know is that I had all the big twists figured out as soon as the unlucky group of castaways started discussing their situation, and I don't even pride myself on that, it was obvious. Now I'll go into exactly why this movie was so bad. If you don't want to know anything about what happens in the movie, stop reading.

***SPOILERS BELOW***

Bad things about this movie:

* Supposedly ""Jigsaw"" is trying to teach a big lesson about getting people to appreciate life. If this is the case, why does everyone die and why is everyone stupid? Not one of the puzzles in the movie is solved in supposedly the way they are supposed to solve it. Anyone who tries just fails and/or dies anyway. Maybe that was the point of the whole thing, but then it's like this whole scheme was set up just to capture the police officer.. seems a bit excessive for that.

* Adding to the above, the link between all the characters is that the boy's father framed all of them for crimes they didn't commit. Again, I don't see why they were all punished for that.

* The characters are way too stupid, even for a horror movie. The moment one of the characters shows an ounce of intelligence, she dies from the toxic gas immediately after. Everyone else just continually does unbelievably stupid things.

* The editing of the movie is condescending. Aside from drawing out the death scenes to ridiculous measures (and playing the same scream sound over and over per death), when the biggest twist is revealed they felt the need to show us how that links to everything else in the movie. I personally enjoy re-watching movies with big twists at the end just to connect the dots myself, but the way this movie ends with the twist montage takes away any need for that.

* Maybe I'm overthinking this motive thing and the whole thing was just a ruse because he knew the others were listening in, but generally when you have the villain in a horror movie explain his motive, he is telling the truth. Here, it's like he went into detail about why he was doing everything, but in the end it meant nothing.

*** SPOILERS ABOVE ***

I don't understand why anyone thinks this is even a decent movie.",1140134400,3,2288,4.441527446300716
1870381,3,B00008YOD2,"Fear of death has overrun society, as fear provides the primal motivating factor to keep people alive.  A notion that Saw (2004) once capitalized on through the evil contraptions that the psychopathic mastermind Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) created to muse himself over innocent people's desire to live.  Jigsaw forced his victims to a rude awakening where his victims learned how and when they would die, unless they acted without hesitation.  Many of the psychopath's devices focused on gruesome self-mutilation that had a clear connection with the victim's character and past.  For Jigsaw, it is a game where he forces his victims to take the test of survival, and if they fail - they die!

The sequel opens in a similar fashion under the cutting light of a naked light bulb where a man awakens undressed with a brutally looking device strapped to his neck and shoulders.  It is clear that the victim is not completely without sin, as he is a police informant.  In order to survive the contraption's bear trap consequence he must obtain a key behind his own eye.  There is an obvious presence of sadistic cruelty, as the man feebly attempts to find a solution to the problem before him.  The resolve of the situation assures the audience that more gruesomeness and terrorizing horror will emerge within the next hour and a half, as the viewer is to experience a fear-inducing sequel with more of Jigsaw's ruthless games.

Unlike the films predecessor, Saw II does not attempt to hide Jigsaw's identity.  Instead, he seems to intentionally seek the law enforcement to apprehend him.  In particular Detective Matthews' (Donnie Walhberg) whom Jigsaw singles out through the message ""Look closer Detective Matthews.""  Quickly, Det. Matthews understands the clues, which leads them to an abandon factory where Jigsaw awaits.  Together with Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) who leads the investigation, Matthews enters the factory with a S.W.A.T. team and after some blood-spattered predicament finds Jigsaw calmly inhaling oxygen through his oxygen mask.

At first, one must sense that it is a trap, and it is, as Jigsaw has kidnapped Matthews's son along with eight other shady characters.  These nine individuals are locked up in a house of unknown location where they have been breathing a highly toxic nerve agent that will begin to dissolve their bodies into bleeding mess of flesh.  In a time when the American people fear terrorist attacks and weapons of mass destruction the concept will undoubtedly enhance the suspense.  However, if additional thought is placed on the concept of the nerve gas, it also provides a huge plot hole. It is not like people can buy nerve gas at the street corner, and it makes it a little amusing that Jigsaw is able to find it.  In addition, nerve gas does not, as far as I know, produce symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.  But, if the audience is willing to see beyond this slightly distorted reality, then Saw II will bring a terrorizing experience.  All Matthews can do is watch his son and the others slowly being decimated by Jigsaw's little games within the game.

Meanwhile, Jigsaw insists to talk with Matthews, as he enlightens Matthews that he must play by his rules if he wants his son alive.  It is with a great deal of irony that Jigsaw has planned this meeting with Matthews, as the detective often plays by his own rules when he arrests suspects.  Besides planning his own capture, Jigsaw has one final triumph up his sleeve, which he plays with brutal refinement when time runs short.

The film possesses disturbing imagery of torture, murder, and other unsettling themes that are presented through Jigsaw's meticulous planning.  The cinematography helps to enhance the dark and agonizing atmosphere through the green camera filter.  In addition, the lighting of the scenes provides additional atmospheric elements that heighten the terror.  Special effects also provide a large bulk of the gruesomeness within the story.  Together with the fundamental concept stemming from the fear of death these visual aspects succeeds in bring forth a traumatic experience.  One of the negative aspects of the film rests within the characters that are portrayed in a too stereotypical perspective and they lack a complex psychology.  The film could also exploit the possibilities of a more profound meaning of why people fear death, which might have augmented the element of horror within the film.  Yet, the overall cinematic experience brings the audience into a disturbing world where horror and terror work very well and leave the audience truly frightened.",1140134400,2,4588,5.035761589403974

There is more of a story in thsi one and there are not pointless charactors and it dosnet drag like the first one.

1870383,5,B00008YOD2,"`Saw II', directed and co-authored by Darren Lynn Boosman probably surprised many by being very successful in the theatre last year, although the original movie in this series was both critically and commercially a bit more successful than the average low budget horror flick, even without a big name such as George Romero or Wes Craven behind the writing and the camera.

I was moderately impressed with the original and I believe this second installment succeeds in being as modestly good as the original, while being just original enough to be interesting in its own right.

The most facinating thing about this story and the way it plays out is that it gives a new look at how emotional, bordering on sheer stupidity, people can be when they are faced with a horrific situation. The classic example of this blindness of rationality is when Jamie Lee Curtis retreats into a basement as she is running away from Michael Myers in Halloween (I). Reason would tell one to not let yourself be backed into a corner. The situation in Saw II is a bit different in that the victims, like the crew of the Nostromo in `Alien' are already trapped in a seemingly inescapable enclosure. The problem is not physical escape, but in solving a puzzle which requires the cooperation of the seven prisoners.

Business trainers hammer constantly on the importance of teamwork in accomplishing things. We are not born with this intuition and if we never played a team sport, we may never have encountered this principle in either our mathematics or Shakespeare or French classes in college. The seven prisoners presented with this puzzle don't need management training to tell them they need to cooperate. Their captor, `Jigsaw', tells them straight away that the solution for their escape depends on cooperation in the two hours they have before the poison gas to which they are exposed does its worst. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, most of the seven die off largely through stupidity fuelled by terror plus selfishness. The failure of the imprisoned principles to have reason overcome fear and greed is one of the two most interesting aspects of the movie. The second, similar theme is the stupidity of the police, primarily of the principle character played by Donnie Wahlberg, to pay attention to what the perp is saying in order to solve his puzzles.

Much credit has to be given to the several horrific traps and tortures to which the perp puts his victims. Compared to some of these perils, Jason's ax and Michael Myers' chef's knife are not much more than deadly kitty toys. Aside from the ingenious conceptions by the writers, there is the excellent realization of these deadly devices in safe Hollywood simulacra. There is not a single clue that what looks like the inevitable mayhem created by the meeting of sharp stainless steel with unprotected flesh is actually done with plastic and cosmetic appliances. While the director's commentary makes it clear that this movie was done on a relatively small budget, it seems like the writers, the director, and the editor, put too much effort into whiz-bang collages with rapidly shifting camera angles rather than dwelling on careful closeups showing the realization of peril on faces rather than spending time on screams and blood.

While the puzzles, the perils, the booby traps, and the threat of time running out are the movie's strong points, along with the audience's frustration with the blindness of reason shown by the vics, the greatest weakness is that the perp's motives are never resolved or even fully explained. Although the principle character is a despicable person, there is no reason why the perp takes it upon himself to rain vengence down on his shoulders, especially by putting the lead character's (relatively) innocent son at risk.

Overall, the story line in this sequel is richer and psychologically more interesting than the first, but both are a bit weak on story.

If you like horror movies, you will certainly like this one. Most of the extras are relatively ordinary, with the most interesting being the revelations of how the special effects teams made plastic and foam and fiber optic cable look like hardwood and iron and stainless steel. My favorite extra, the director's commentary almost totally ignores the psychologically interesting aspects of the story and spends all its time dwelling on the problems of shooting and the skill of the actors in certain situations.

Hollywood has lost it's flare when it comes to horror flicks, but SAW is one of the films they got right this time. True, there wasn't enough blood and gore, but the suspense and plot compensated for the lack thereof. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Jigsaw's protege in the future.

1870385,3,B00008YOD2,"Okay, so if you're reading this, you probably have a pretty good idea of the set up. Serial Killer (Jigsaw) returns to torment more of the poor saps he views as wasting their lives. Sticks them all in a room to escape from (and in this case, a house), filled with all sorts of nasty little ambushes along the way, and taunts the cop(s) who track him down, until they play along with his twisted little game.

Frankly, the first Saw suprised me. Nice premise, an abundance of ingeniously grisly scenarios, effective twist at the end. On reflection, it's almost too preposterous to get around. The acting was God-awful bad, especially by Cary Elwes. And you can't tell me that the two imbeciles chained a few feet apart in that itty-bitty room wouldn't eventually have figured out that the guy lying on the floor between them in a pool of blood wasn't really dead, got a little bit ticked off, and taken their saws to him. I mean, come on. How long can somebody lie on a cold tile floor and stay perfectly still? You'd think at some point his bladder would've given out, or something. I guess though, being Jigsaw he would have been prepared for that eventuality.

Still, all and all a decent low-budget indie horror film.

A decent, low budget indie horror film that made a butt-load of money. And what do the studio guys in Hollywood do when the smell of a franchise wafts their way? That's right. Sequels. So here we are...

This time around, director Darren Lynn Bousman had more cash to play with, although it doesn't really show. The production values all look about the same, and we don't really get any more 'big name' actors either.

However, the acting in this go-around is in better shape, at least by the main players. Donnie Wahlberg works hard to bring his underwritten character - the disenfranchised, angry cop - to life. Honestly, everybody is underwritten; just there as set pieces to be whacked off, one-by-one, in various grisly ways.

Overall, the film isn't bad, but it suffers from conforming to another of Hollywoods universal rules: audiences want the same thing, only different.

Sequel-itis.

1870387,4,B00008YOD2,"Spoiler if you haven't seen the first one...

33 years ago, a young man named Wes Craven wrote and directed `The Last House on the Left', a horror movie so disturbing; it was banned in certain areas.  A film about the evil torture of the innocent and the innocent torturing the evil as a method of retribution.  I'm oversimplifying, and leaving out the parts where tools are used on human teeth, but that's the once-sentence story.  Two years ago, we got to see torture (very intricate, very disturbing) in a fairly well-written and entertaining movie, `Saw'.  This time around, we get to see elements of good vs. evil, as fought out with a furnace, syringes, etc.

Anyone who saw the first knows there is a twist.  The `good' is ""Jigsaw"", the serial killer, who claims never to have murdered anyone.  As a terminal cancer patient, he `teaches' people who he feels are wasting the precious gift of life, by placing them in fatal positions where escape is possible.  This he considers a `game', and if you lose you die.  Winning usually involves some form of horrific self mutilation, so the home version of this game will probably not be out next Christmas.

The movie does raise some interesting and inherent questions.  The obvious being `Is life wasted by drudging through the same routine day after day?' but going as far as `Should a child suffer for the sins of the father?'  These questions and many other are dealt with in grotesque and unimaginable ways, which left me both cringing and thinking (cringing more than thinking to be fair).

The characters are somewhat forgettable, and highly unlikable.  In a life or death circumstance, they are unable to cooperate in even the simplest form.  Late in the film, we are given a reason why these people were chosen, and Jigsaw's prediction of this lack of cooperation, but it is a bit grating at times.

In a line at the end of the film, Jigsaw says ""It's the last house on the left"", which strings some obvious, if not immediately apparent similarities, and serves as an unmistakable homage.

This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  The young ones will be traumatized.  If you are extremely suggestible and slightly psychotic, do the rest of us a favor and skip this one.  And if you happen to live next door to James Wan, you might want to make a point of showing him just how much you enjoy and appreciate life.",1140048000,,2375,4.620525059665871
1870388,5,B00008YOD2,"The evil ""jigsaw"" is back for another round of mayhem and torture in this fine sequel to the first ""Saw""  Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is investigating a recent homicide when he discovers that the victim has a jigsaw shaped piece of skin removed.  That left no question in his mind who was behind the killings: Jigsaw himself.  At first, Matthews is reluctant to get involved in the jigsaw case, but with a little prodding from his partner Kerry (Dina Meyer) and a sudden realization on his part, Eric finds out where Jigsaw is hiding out and moves in for the capture.

However, unknown to Eric and Kerry, capture was part of Jigsaw's plan.  He has captured eight more unsuspecting hostages and locked them in a house which is slowly being contaminated by poison gas.  To make matters worse, one of the intended victims is Eric's own son Daniel (Erik Knudsen).  All of the hostages have one thing in common; they were all set up by Detective Matthews in order for him to gain a conviction.

Jigsaw has supposedly hid vials of antedote throughout the house which will counter-act the effects of the poison, but there are other clues as well.  Each person has a number drawn on the back of their necks.  These numbers form a combination to a safe which contains the antedote.  It soon becomes apparent that the only way the hostages will survive is to work together, but that idea soon goes out the window, and everyone is looking out for themselves and not worrying about anyone else.

Meanwhile, Jigsaw and Detective Matthews have begun an interesting interaction of their own.  Jigsaw practically tells Matthews the location of his son at the beginning of their conversation, but Matthews, in his rage, misses the clues.  Soon, Matthews loses all of his patience and unleashes his own attack on Jigsaw.  Will Detective Matthews find his son before its too late?

I thought the first movie was good, but this one is even better.  The plot of this movie is excellent, and the high point of the film is its surprise ending.  It will leave you spellbound.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting is very good, and the twists and turns will keep you glued to the screen.  This movie is a must for horror movie fans and people who saw the first film.

What makes this movie so great is that this gives a story to who the Jigsaw Killer really is. In the first film, he is rarely seen and portrayed as some kind of monster. In this film, he is on almost the entire time giving his story and it makes him more human and actually a little sympathetic. That's the basic idea of the film, people trying to escape Jigsaw's game is only a minor side story and not a major plot like in the original. This story is really made just to tell you a little bit about who Jigsaw really is.

Those people who had to solve a puzzle to live had an easy one to solve to the viewing audience. I figured out the answer fifteen mintues into the film, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film. It's one of those things that if you don't figure it out by the end, you slap your forehead for not knowing how obvious it was saying ""Of course!""

The actors do a great job. Tobin Bell really shines in the film since he finally has a lot of speaking parts in the film. He makes the character very convincing, intellegent and like I said before, actually sympethetic to the point you kind of feel sorry for him.

So overall, if you liked the first film, you will also like this one. Knowing Jigsaw more and seeing his human side is worth it alone, it puts a face on the character. But, I don't feel it is better than the first movie. Some of the things in this film were typical and not really original or rarely seen like what was in the first movie. I do recommend this film to fans, Saw 3 is right now being made and will be released this year and I welcome it",1140048000,,1832,4.010958904109589
1870422,4,B00008YOD2,"Let me first start by saying that all in all this was a pretty good movie; and all things considered i probably would have loved it, save for the fact that I've already seen this movie before when it was called 'CUBE' (a movie on DVD about a bunch of strangers put into a maze filled with traps, where they have a small amount of time to escape before they die, and to make things worse.. one of the people with them is slowly turning into a murderous psychopath... oh and i forgot, the exit of both movies is found in a sequence of hidden numbers).

Anyway, in SAW II you are taken on yet another venture into the sadistic sociopathic mind of John 'The Jigsaw Killer' and we get to see small bits behind the mind of the madman (check out [...] for a brief cartoon about how he became what he is today). One of the low points in this movie that i enjoyed more in the first was there was a great deal more character development in the prisoners than there was in this movie, and if you pay real close attention (check to see who isn't coughing up blood in the house and ask yourself why) you might just be able to piece together the shocking ending.

Now a brief note to the members of LIONS GATE and Twisted Pictures..... OK we the many Fans of SAW get the picture... Yea Yea we all waste moments in out lives and probably deserve a good kick in the can for it..... I mean heck i probably should be out feeding orphan kittens right now rather than writing this review right? We get the idea now here's a few for you...Either take this franchise in another direction, end it here in SAW II or end it in a trilogy. I mean the 'we aren't grateful for our lives thing' can only stay fresh for so long.  I mean in SAW III Jigsaw could put a whole city to a test of life or death to save themselves after pumping poison in the water supply. Or maybe someone can give him a taste of his own medicine putting him to the test in a challenge where the prize would be the cure to cancer. But to those of you in charge of this franchise please don't murder this movie (with endless pointless sequels that bastardize a once unique concept) just so you can line your pockets with money.

Sorry for that rant, bottom line is the movie is pretty good and clearly worth watching unless of course you've seen 'CUBE' in which case you've already seen SAW II you just don't know it yet. This movie stays true to the original and overall is a quality sequel (especially compared to most horror movie sequels). And there was something else i meant to tell you..... Oh Yes........There will Be Blood.",1139961600,,2577,4.253061224489796

Saw 2 follows the formular of Saw 1 a little bit and in a way that makes it a little bit predictable ... however that's not a bad thing! Just like in Saw 1, there is somebody following the orders of Jigsaw. This time by love (family love) and not by threat!

The killer is a scientist, enginnering branch to be exact! As you know he comes up with elaborate schemes and inventions to kill people but also what is funny about this killer is that he wants the victims to escape and have a new appreciation for life. In Saw 2 we get to learn his motivation for doing something like this which is good. The movie lets us into JigSaws mind a little bit. Got to love that!

Also, I think the surprise ending is just as good as the last one ... well I sortof knew what was coming, but this is a fun movie. So sit back and enjoy, you'll have fun with this movie.",1139961600,,1001,3.970149253731343

The 2nd one while still very clever and nice i still kind of had a feeling. But all and all this is a great movie. I also love the fact my boys were involved with this movie. That to me was another added bonus to this great film. MUDVAYNE ARE GODS!!!!!! if you don't like my comment or flat out don't like Mudvayne then well...truthfully nobody cares.

Reviewer: James M. Hawk (columbus, ohio United States) - See all my reviews

while saw 2 is fun and entertains, it actually lies to its audience about PLAYING BY THE RULES. I am not buying the quick explanation that so many movies do because they try explain the movie like we did not already know.  its a slap to the viewers intelligence and renders the movie ultimately cheap.  mtv camera cuts really do not help the effect or tone of the movie.  I just think we deserved more.  hopefully the SAW 3 will bring a finite feeling to the franchise.",1139875200,,586,4.429906542056075

I saw this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it! It is in my opinion way better that the first Saw. It keeps you guessing the whole movie and just when you think you have it figured out, another twist develops and you're wrong again. I really loved it and look forward to adding the DVD to my collection.

Don't get me wrong the first saw is ok but its rare that a sequel is better than the first...

I just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie...",1139702400,5,691,4.073529411764706
1870475,2,B00008YOD2,"The first Saw, while gross and distasteful, is pretty good.  This very disappointing sequel, however, takes the disgust and gore to another level.  Most movies these days, like Saw II, Hostel, and Wolf Creek, are more interested in making its viewers vomit rather than concentrating on a decent horror plot.  The twist is so expected, even if you can't figure it out, that it doesn't have the same effect as the first movie.  While the twist is mildly clever, the completely disgusting effects doom this movie from the beginning and it never fully recovers; a terrible movie.",1139529600,,575,4.896907216494846

Here we go again.  The bad guy wants people to change their ways, so why not open a counseling center; no, instead through some source of funding and high understanding of electronics, etc...he puts together grand schemes in which people get killed.  The ending of the movie was a complete joke.  Why would one of the abductees work for someone that tried to kill her?  She was thrown into a pit of needles and still she plays along; I think she would have just given up.  Innocent people die around her and she doesn't care to help them.  Also, the people in the house work against eachother for some odd reason,rather than help eachother out.  Where did the bad get the nerve gas and antidote.  Nothing like that is explained.  I think in the next movie they should have everyone work together and then defeat the bad guy/girl.  Finally give us some satisfaction.",1139184000,,886,4.688311688311688

I think that these movies will go on for years due to their originality and popularity.

1870478,4,B00008YOD2,"The diabolic Jigsaw is back in the follow up to the smash ""Saw"" which came out of nowhere to become one of the biggest grossing horror films of all time. Not content to rest on the mayhem he created in the first film, Jigsaw is back kidnapping those he deems unworthy of life, and forcing them to earn their lives back in a series of brutal and bizarre games, where death is all to often the result.

The sequel picks up shortly after the events of the first film where Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is investigating yet another victim. The fact that the victim is missing a puzzle shaped piece of skin leaves no doubt as to who is behind this killing, and Matthews and his task force set up their efforts to stop the killer before he can strike again.

  A sudden inspiration leads Matthews and his team to a factory where they soon discover Jigsaw amongst all of his toys and traps. The frail Jigsaw is dying from a terminal illness, and he reveals to Matthews that he has a game underway, one where a group of people are trapped in a remote house filled with traps that are also filling up with a deadly gas. Only those who can survive the traps and decipher the clues will be able to locate the antidotes and survive the mayhem.

  Matthews is even more determined to find the locale of the house as his son is one of the individuals trapped inside slowly dying from the poison. Matthews and his team can see what is happening in the house via a video monitor and while the team attempts to determine the location and save the individuals, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), plays a dangerous game with Matthews as he attempts to interrogate him for information.

  The film moves back and forth from the interrogation to the individuals trapped in the house and keeps the tension going. While not as claustrophobic or as gory as the original, ""Saw 2""

benefits from an interesting premise and a rousing finale that sets the stages for the pending ""Saw 3"". Some may find a bit of issue with the pacing as it does not contain as the tension and scares are scarcer than they are in the first release.

  Solid performances throughout makes ""Saw 2"" a cut above most horror films and is not to be missed by fans of the original.

This one is better. The deaths are cooler, there is more blood, and the end is just as twisted as the first. When i went in to see this movie, i was like okay, this will probably not be as good as the original , but it will be worth watching. Boy, did i eat my words when i was finished. I was amazed that it was so good. I was even surprised that the ending was twisted because if you saw the first one, then you already know everything. WRONG. I was impressed with this movie for it's twists and turns. Kudos to the film makers and actors for giving us such a great movie. I am really looking forward to Saw 3. And when i see it, I will be prepared for another twisted ending. These movies are the number one suspense/twisted ending movies.

1870502,2,B00008YOD2,"In the original Saw, The Jigsaw Killer locked Dr. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell and chained there feet up in a murky bathroom with a dead guy in the middle of the room and the only way the can get out is to saw threw their feet..well, Elwes sawed threw his leg and the dead guy in the center just so happened to be the Jigsaw Killer. Now, in Saw 2, Det. Donnie Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher, Ransom) is on the case of the Jigsaw Man with Det. Dina Meyer (Stranger Than Fiction, Starship Troopers) and the swat team at his side as they finally capture the Jigsaw Killer, played by Tobin Bell (The Firm. Malice) who is dying of cancer. Wahlberg finds out that there are several people in a room locked up with no way out and they are breathing in a deadly nerve agent that destroys your insides and if they don't make it in time, solve the puzzles, then their all going to die. Once they escape the room, they go on a frantic spree around the house looking for ways to get out and Donnie Wahlberg is trying to get Jigsaw Killer to tell him where the people are because one of those people is his son. A perfect companion movie to the original Saw meshes well with it, notably towards the end. Wahlberg gets some credit for delivering a good performance and Tobin Bell is wonderfully creepy as The Jigsaw Killer. Fans of the first or really major horror buff fans will love the new traps that are set in the movie...with bloody effect...they love their blood those horror junkies. Some energy gets drained here and there but what keeps it alive is the ending. Also starring Franky G (The Italian Job, Wonderland), Glenn Plummer (South Central, Speed), Beverly Mitchell (Tv's 7th Heaven), Shawnee Smith (Tv's Becker), Eric Knudsen (The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio), Tony Nappo (Land of the Dead, Four Brothers), Tim Burd (Resident EvilApocalypse) and Emmanuelle Vaugier (Cerberus).

There are more bodies, I mean actors in this version. I rate both movies pretty equally. Wahlberg is a pretty pi$$ed off cop/father who does a good job of busting ""jigsaws"" chops in this flick. The action and suspense of this film is very fast paced compared to the first film. With a wide range of traps and scenerios presented to the victims, this series is one of the great horror ones in years! This is a must buy, and forget renting movie. Remember in the 80's with all the slasher movies? After the first movie they all got really silly  and tried too hard to be many things, instead of great horror. Saw is a franchise that should have some life in it for atleast the third installment, which is guaranteed at the end of Saw 2. 2 bloody thumbs up mate",1138147200,2,919,4.281609195402299
1870504,5,B00008YOD2,"After watching the incredible SAW that graced our screens last year - it was a given that I would see the MUCH ANTICIPATED sequel.

This film seems to have more of a story-line than the original... JIG-SAW is at it again and this time locks up 8 people inside an abandoned, creepy old house. They are trapped in the building and a lethal gas has been pumped into the house for a while. They have exactly 2 hours to each, find a room marked for their attention, crack the game needed to be played and won and inject the antidote into their systems. They also have the option to play each game a little ""further and harder"" in order to find a 2nd Antidote : perhaps for a friend they have made amongst the 8 strangers. Inevitably, going for the 2nd one - may end in death.

To add an incredible dimension to the story, DONNIE WAHLBERG, who plays a cop in the film : catches JIG-SAW at the start of the film and then finds out that JIG-SAW has his son in he house. The race against time plays out awesomely in the film, as does the films running time and the fact that each and every character in the house is running closer to death from the lethal gas.

DONNIE WALHBERG is awesome, as is the cast of basic unknows. TOBIN BELL (JIGSAW) is incredibly creepy.

And finally : if you thought the original ending came at BREAK-NECK-SPEED... this one is going to hit you LIKE A SACK OF BRICKS TRAVELLING AT MACH 1...

As is the basic rule for sequels : THE BODY COUNT IS ALWAYS MUCH HIGHER... THE DEATH SCENES ARE ALWAYS MORE ELABORATE AND OH YES... THERE WILL BE BLOOD!!!",1138060800,7,1564,4.288135593220339
1870505,5,B00008YOD2,"I went to go see this movie in theaters the night it came out because I thought that the first Saw was really good. I was just hoping that the directors, writers, and producers were not just putting out some crap sequal so that people would see it. (You know, one with no plot, bad acting, and that is very predictible) However I was very, very, very pleased with this sequal. I enjoyed this movie just as much (if not more) than the origional. (And with all of the sequals that I've seen I have never been able to say that before) I felt as if the plot was pretty average (parents get divorced, the kid turns into a punk because of it, and he and his dad fight over it) However, as the story goes along, I realised something. In all of the movies that I have seen with that sort of storyline, this one was VERY different. So the plot gets an A+ in my book even though it is not that origional. Now what is origional is all of the twists and turns that the storyline actually go through. The ending totally blew my mind. I had no idea that was going to happen. (Don't worry I won't spoil it) Now some people are saying on here that this movie did not live up to the first one. I could not disagree more. If you were to take all of the acting, twists, gore, and even the death traps, then multiply them by 100 this is exactally what you would get. Plus, I mean how many horror movies have you seen that were this thought out? I say that because about 99.9% of horror movies that have been released recentaly have been just crap. Most of which I went to go see in theaters, and felt as if I had got screwed out of the money that I used to pay for the ticket. Mostly due to the fact that either the commercial was very diceiving, bad acting, or it was just some stupid college movie slasher. Either that or I felt like I could have crapped out a better idea for a movie. (Officially known as that turd of a movie titled ""Hostle"") Anyway, what I am trying to say is that for a horror movie (or for any type of movie out there) this movie has it all. Great acting, great storyline, great gore special effects, awesome villian, and one of the best endings I have ever seen in my life and in any movie. So, go out on February 14 (unless they change the date that has been anounced) and buy this DVD!!! I greatly recommend it and you will not be disappointed!",1137628800,3,2351,4.124183006535947

The first SAW was very original and on your seat suspense. Although this movie can be frightening at times but the lack of good actors didn't contribrute to this film.

When i heard that Saw II was coming out i was afraid that this movie could ruin the legacy of ""Saw"" by not being able to live up to the original. Man was i wrong!!!

The movie does live up to the original, of course the first saw is my favorite, but the sequel is strong in its own potential and really stands out. The movie has really good acting, its well scripted and it has a good follow up to the first one.

However i do have just one observation. The first movie was called Saw do to the fact that the characters have to use a saw to escape. Now in Saw II, the movie dosent really relate to the title unless you're using the word ""SAW"" as for seeing and not ""SAW"" as a tool.",1137024000,2,801,3.9382716049382718
1870551,4,B00008YOD2,"Saw II is an especially good sequel.  If you enjoyed the first movie, you will definitely find the second to your liking.

There are several disturbing scenes, which is what makes these movies interesting.  While the movie had the same feel as the first one, it certainly was not a reproduction of the first.

For starters, there are several people in a house together who must try to find a way out.  This allows for more relationships to form and the possibility of the viewer feeling empathy for one or more of the victims.

The ending was very clever and definitely allows for more sequels.  Some have said the ending was predictible, but unless they heard something about the movie in advance, I find this hard to believe.

If you like smart horror movies (or the first Saw movie), you will not be disappointed with Saw II.",1136851200,6,828,4.585034013605442
1870552,3,B00008YOD2,"After watching the epic called SAW, I was a bit over enthusiastic because of how immensely interesting the film is. Jigsaw soon became one of my favourite & most interesting villains of all time. I like the masks and characters used to define the startling fear of Jigsaw used in SAW. I expected something more than what I got from SAW2.

Saw 2 is better than your average film and I would rate it four stars had I not seen Saw. I expected more from this film than a film full of commercial intent. Yes,friends, there is a lot of blood in this film but what the film lacks is that fear Saw got out of me(viewer). Saw2 is mostly loud yet unpenetrating. It's like a freakshow where a lot of characters are put into one sequence. It is sad to observe that the director couldn't overcome the FAILING SEQUEL SYNDROME the film industry is blessed with.

Although I'm terrible at pinpointing flaws and guessing the suspense, Saw II is predictable enough for me to have guessed the twist in the end. A review on imdb.com said the twist in the end is even more ingenious than Saw. I strongly disagree.

Saw2 is a mixed bag because of how confused the direction seems. The pace of the story is slow from the start especially since many unknown characters are pooled in. I suggest you give the film a watch for yourself to understand how aimless the direction gets an hour into the movie.

Please See, If you think Final Destination2 is a better film than its prequel , you will like Saw2. In 18 months time, Saw III will be released and I will make sure I watch it. The policeman(father) in the film played a rather lousy role but I blame the direction rather than the actor for it.

Want to watch a violent film that will shake your faith? Watch  OLDBOY to see what flabbergasting suspense is all about.

1870554,3,B00008YOD2,"The thing about this movie was,

it tried too hard to be scary.

I personally do not think this movie was as good as the first one. It was horribly disgusting and gruesome, which explains why it was rated R ( and i'm only 15 by the way, haha). Definitely more blood and more cruelty. But that kinda takes the scariness out of it. In fact, it makes you want to puke more compared to scariness.

The ending was kind of lame, actually. I found it pretty predictable. And kind of impossible, too.

You also never find out what happened to Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Did he make it or not?

That's something I really really want to know.

And there is just one thing I cannot get out of my head.

The woman who later gets both her hands caught while she was trying to get the antedote,

why couldn't she get the antidote from outside?

that even seems easier.

why did she have to stick her hands into those two holes?

i mean, it's just stupid. Even someone who's almost lost their conciousness would have the instinct to get the antedote from the outside, which was perfectly reachable.

oh yeah. and Daniel is hot.

have a good time watching this movie, but I really don't think it's as good as the first. Oh yeah, and it's kind  of disturbing, so I'd reccomend it for only die-hard horror movie fans.",1136505600,2,1293,4.333333333333333

Unfortunately, ""Saw II"" was a bit of a letdown compared with its predecessor.  The plot was too far fetched and the traumas often too predictable.  It's one of those cases where the child fails to live up to live up to the parent.  The end is obviously left open for a further sequel.

  Running Time: 92 min.
 Tobin Bell, Shawnee Smith, Dina Meyer return.
  This sequel is an excellent companion piece to the first film, SAW (2004).  I will not reveal any of the twists and surprises in the film, but it is another mind blower.
  In my opinion, SAW 2 is the best of the film series.
  The opening of the Twisted Pictures production, we see Michael  (Noam Jenkins) who is wearing an opened iron face mask contraption and must obey the orders of the Jigsaw Killer.  He has only a small amount of time to find the key that will set him free and alive.  If he doesn't ""retrieve"" the key, the iron face mask will close on his face and kill him.
  Cop, Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) must bail out his son, Daniel (Erik Knudsen) from jail.  He is tired of dealing with his son's behavior and is so stressed out, he wants him to live somewhere else.  Matthews must answer to a call of a homicide.  The Jigsaw Killer has struck again.  He comes face to face with the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) and Matthews and his team find themselves under timed pressure.
  Eight people(Shawnee Smith, Franky G., Erik Knuden, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Beverley Mitchell, Glenn Plummer, Timothy Burd, Tony Nappo) are locked in a room somewhere in town. They must find them because Matthew's son is also trapped in that room and time is running out.
  That is only the start of this film.  Memorable, shocking scenes you will never forget.
  Donnie Wahlberg and Franky G. really are interesting in this film.  They both give strong performances.

  Producer Gregg Hoffman died December 4, 2005. Age 42. He was admitted to the hospital complaining of neck pain. He died of natural causes.

Fullscreen Rated ""R"" DVD edition includes interesting audio Commentary with director Darren Lynn Bausman and actor, Donnie Wahlberg. it can be found in ""Set-Up"".
  Featurettes will show you how all traps were created including the oven and the hypodermic needles trap.

The DVD container is wrapped in tight plastic, but be careful, there is also a protective see-through cover slip that lifts off that you need to save. Notice the security seals still on your container. You will have to peel these or cut them to open the container. I like to leave my seals intact.  The DVD itself looks like a saw blade with Jigsaw's face on it.

1870569,3,B00008YOD2,"The recent intent to explicitly capture the malicious mutilation of various cinematic youths has resulted in a slew of sadistic shockers, (Cabin Fever, The Descent, Wolf Creek) that appear to embrace a visually exploitative sensibility comparable to the impoundable `video nasties' of the 1980s. As with James Wan's original Saw (2004), first time director Darren Lynn Bousman's continuum dishes up a gruesome slice of exploitation, sitting beside notorious nasties The Driller Killer and The Evil Dead  in terms of provoking revulsion from scenes of dismemberment and bloody carnage.

Continuing the moral notion for family values established in the original, (where threat of family loss was used to punish adulterer Cary Elwes), Saw II sees Donnie Wahlberg's divorced detective Eric Matthews forced to confront the estranged relationship with his son Daniel, to save him from a life threatening situation: Daniel is among a group of eight former criminals incarcerated inside a venomous shelter by the notorious cancer-ridden killer Jigsaw. ""There will be blood"" assures the moral equalizer; and like its predecessor, Saw II harks back to the macabre unpleasantness witnessed in Se7en. But where Saw -concerning the plight of two strangers who awaken ankle-chained to pipes in a derelict washroom - capitalised on its creepily confined claustrophobic setting and main premise, in addition to adhering a mysterious intrigue akin to an Outer Limits episode, or a portmanteau horror, Saw II attempts to draw its impact by cross-cutting between the Jigsaw's secluded laboratory - who is antagonized by Detective Matthews - and the Cube-style booby trapped shelter that is under surveillance.

One of the highpoints of the original was to keep Jigsaw shrouded behind the sinister workings of a mannequin puppet or grim reaper figure. However here Jigsaw (aka John Creamer) is unveiled and scrutinized in confrontation scenes which, though permit an arresting insight into the moral retribution of the killings, (a failed suicide attempt precipitated John's moral endeavour) decrease his ominous appeal. The return of Tobin Bell as Jigsaw - his gravely disconcerting voice lending a haunting presence - brings some respectability, however neither Walberg - as the archetypal hard-bitten detective - nor the derivative group of ex-cons, (including Shawnee Smith returning as previous Jigsaw soul survivor Amanda) appear capable of endorsing anything above two dimensional credibility.

While Saw retained a cold, clinical aesthetic, Saw II is drenched in murky green monochromic hues and relies on frenetic flashy whip pans and zooms to kinetically divulge information - overlaid by the drones and murmurs of Charlie Clouser's continuously pulsating score. The remote voyeuristic house setting, and `detestable youths in peril' situation may recall Big Brother horror rehash My Little Eye (2002), however Saw II sadly lacks that film's intense claustrophobia and hauntingly anonymous voyeurism, (we and Detective Matthews are clearly the only voyeurs here) to succeed anything above the shoddy webcam gimmickry of Halloween: Resurrection (2002).

While Saw built upon nervous anticipation to it's inevitably `saw off' scene, Saw II - lacking the titular tool - thrusts from one nasty set piece to the next - the most gruesome being a bladed box which gushes the blood from one unfortunate victims limbs. And while there are references as diverse as The Last House on the Left (1972), Park Chan-Wook's Old boy (2003) and Eyes Without a Face (1959), (one deceased victim dons a waxen mask recalling Georges Franju's vintage creeper), in conjunction with an opening sequence evoking the infamous cow eye slashing in Luis Bunuel's  Un Chien Andolou (1925), Saw II fails to encapsulate the required clat to resonate alongside such treasured horrors; eventually opting for a neat twist revelation which, while satisfyingly shuddering the mind with delirious dj vu unsurprisingly etches for the inevitable follow-up.",1134518400,2,4005,5.514657980456026
1870570,5,B00008YOD2,"Quite frankly, I hated the first film. I thought it was just a crappy movie with a weak storyline, 5,000 flashbacks, flasbacks within flashbacks, a disappointing ending and pointless bloody violence despite the low budget of the film. I expected the same thing from this film, but I'm glad that I was wrong. This movie was really good. I don't wanna spoil it for you if you haven't seen it, but this ending I never saw coming. Also, the death scenes were a lot more intricate and executed (no pun intended)this time around. I really wanna leave a review that doesn't give away too much. Needless to say, I LIKED IT!!!",1134000000,2,617,4.5675675675675675
1870571,2,B00008YOD2,"I wasn't much impressed with the first ""Saw"" but now I realize the first one was a masterpiece comparing to the sequel. The second ""Saw"" is not boring or dumb - it's rather interesting to watch and to follow the story-line. It's interesting to expect the upcoming plot-twist and identification of a killer. But from this kind of a film you always expect something more than just being an ordinary thriller. Unfortunately here you don't get anything except a certain number of used cliches. In the end I got so many questions I didn't know whom to ask. I'm not going to ask now not to spoil the movie for you, I'll just say there are so many flaws in the film... Its creators didn't even try to cover them up. OK, every film has some, and I usually tend not to notice them, but here it was just outrageous.

There are successful movies with just a couple of main characters (like ""Saw"", ""Cube"" or ""Blair Witch Project""). When sequel is being made filmmakers stick much more characters into it because they just don't know what to do with this amount of film time. They don't have a talent (like makers of the original) to make a picture with two main characters so it could be intense and gripping and thrilling. It's easier to kill another character every 10 minutes than to keep a viewer breathless for hour and a half, concentrating on just two persons.

In ""Saw 2"" when I saw this bunch of people obviously going to get murdered, I understood right away - this won't be a talented thriller.

Yes, it has its tense moments, thrill and gore, but as I said, from this kind of film you expect a lot more.

A definite potboiler.",1133395200,2,1626,4.446308724832215
1870572,3,B00008YOD2,"Considering the very short pre-production period, and the enormous pressure that the filmmakers must have been feeling after the surprise hit of `Saw', it must be said that `Saw II' did a very good job. The script of the sequel, which was originally written as a thriller unrelated to `Saw,' surely borrows many elements from other films including `Saw' (yes of course), but still is effective as suspense with much gore, largely due to its better editing and sound effects.

[ONE THING] you must do before watching `Saw II' is to see the original, in which one serial killer Jigsaw spears. It is very important for some characters re-appear in the sequel, and they play a considerably significant role in `Saw II.' And it would be a good test for you - if you find the original too violent and gory, you don't have to see the sequel, which is equally violent and gory.

The sequel again shows the characters trapped in an old dirty room - this time eight persons - for the reasons only Jigsaw knows. These elaborate tricks are set up by the same Jigsaw, who again keeps on watching these confined characters through some media, but this sequel has a nice additional touch. For the two police detectives (Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer) are allowed to share the same experience as audience in the way I should not reveal.

But the escape from the deadly house wholly depends on the actions of the trapped people, All the lethal traps or props are prepared in the most sinister (or nasty) way you can think of. Still, if you have seen the films of this genre, it is not difficult to anticipate what is coming next. At least you can sense something is there, even though admittedly some of the scenes involving these tricks always looks painful, or are really scare-inducing at times.

However, as some viewers have said perhaps too rightly about the improbability of `Saw II' and its story, these characters often behave in the most stupid way, and the script is full of plot holes. Why don't they realize the importance of the hints Jigsaw gave right before them?  Why do they do unnecessary things like you know what? But booby traps are called booby traps because they don't catch wise people, so let's forget the incomprehensible behaviors of some characters, and not-so-good acting of some players.

The ending (no spoilers) of `Saw II' is certainly surprising, but you may call it silly. But I found the original's ending surprising and silly, and in this sense the sequel did a fine job, a rare thing you can find these days when you see dreadfully silly sequels like `Cube 2.' `Saw II,' which benefits from bigger budget and more calculated editing, is a success as far as its visceral sensation goes. For all the dull explanations about Jigsaw's motives or many other atrociously philosophical nonsense, `Saw II' doesn't hide the fact that the film is all about the 'game,' about having fun, about feeling sensation and shock, and as such it is quite good.",1133308800,,2964,4.712355212355212
1870573,5,B00008YOD2,"i went into this movie thinking it would be corny and cheesy and waste because of how much i hated saw 1 (i thought that one suked), but this one did the exact opposite.

1870574,4,B00008YOD2,"I suppose it would be ok to give away a description of the first scene and not make anyone to angry. I would hate to spoil this horror mystery for anyone interested.

At the outset, we join a new victim of the Jigsaw killer shortly before his terror inducing, blood-pressure raising death. As in the first movie, a beaten and bloodied man awakens to his horror with a strange contraption attached to his neck. A close-up shows us his first person view of an open mask lined with what appears to be old nails. Loud noises, amplified breathing sound and cut shots accompany, I suppose to add tension and it does quite a good job of it. I found myself unintentionally squeezing my wife's knee harder and harder (happened many times during the movie). An old banged up TV abruptly turns on, as in the first movie, with the face of the goofy but creepy puppet slowly waxing into view. The subject is then informed by said puppet that unless he finds the key to his death mask within the allotted time, the spring mechanism will activate and...Well, you know. The TV screen then switches to a recording showing the subject unconscious on a table and a hooded man performing some sort of vivisection on the sleeping man in the area of his eyes. You then notice the blood crusting his right eye as his trembling hand reaches to feel the swollen socket, eye still intact. The voice-over puppet explains that since the subject in his daily life was an informant, that it only fitting that the key hidden behind the very thing he used to make his money. The following xray flashed on screen guarantees that the key is indeed behind his eye. That is when he finds the scalpel, and Mr. Puppet tells him to choose between his eye and his life. We are then treated to the wonderful visual feast that is a man attempting to cut out his own eye. This is mostly shown in close-up and I hope it doesn't ruin it for you knowing that he does manage to slice himself pretty good before giving up.

If the scene I have just described disturbed you then I think the director accomplished what he set out to do. If it kinda' makes you nauseous, you may want to either bring a barf bag or don't go see it. For gods' sake, do not let your children go see it either. I think half of the people in the theater were under 18. This really isn't a movie for kids, or for most adults either. On the other hand, if you can separate movies from reality and just want to get a little adrenalin pumping for once at the movies, then this is definitely for you.

I really cannot say much else about the plot without ruining it. Suffice it to say that the two main stories follow a police detective, old and worn out (played beautifully by Danny Walberg) and his son, a budding criminal. The son and his group of fellow captives struggle to find the antidote to a deadly nerve agent hidden somewhere in the booby-trapped house they the have awakened in. At the same time the father struggles to get the where-abouts of his son out of the captured ""Jigsaw"", the apparently infirm old man from the first movie. Many of the questions left from that movie are answered in an acceptable manner and if you've seen the first and even remotely enjoyed it then this is definitely for you.

It is a great mystery and if you can figure out how everything went down before the surprise ending, then you my friend are a smarter man than I. But, don't break your arm patting your back, because that ain't sayin' much.",1132358400,4,3463,4.40625
1870575,4,B00008YOD2,"I was blown away by the original 'Saw'.  I don't know what I was expecting going into it but I got way more than I thought I would.  I consider 'Saw' to be about the most effective psychological thriller I have seen since 'Seven'.  So I was a bit wary, especially after its immense success, to hear that a sequel was being rushed to be put out around a year after the original.  Now for a film in Hollywood to be written, shot, edited, and released in less than a year...that usually spells doom.  And for a sequel it signals that the studio is cashing in on the original's success.  And when the director and co-writer of the original(James Wan)drops out, you have to figure that the sequel is going to be another log squeezed out of the Hollywood turd factory.

But you would be wrong.  'Saw II' is a very effective sequel.  There are three carryovers from the original:  Tobin Bell as Jigsaw(who we find his real name to be John Kramer), Shawnee Smith as Amanda(the only Jigsaw victim to ever survive one of his ""games""), and Dina Meyer as Kerry, a detective obsessed with catching Jigsaw.

Newly introduced is Donnie Walberg as a burnout cop with family problems who is partnered with Meyer's character and is unexpectedly brought into Jigsaw's web when Walberg's son is kidnapped and put into one of the killer's ""games"".  Walberg's son is trapped in a house with a few other new victims.  Their connection to one another, at first, is unknown but eventually comes to fruition.

The violence is gruesome and plentiful.  The script is tight and while not as clever as its predecessor, it is effective.  The acting is very good:  Bell, as everything he is in, is excellent along with some very fine performances by Walberg and Smith.  Basically, if you like 'Saw' you are definitely going to like this sequel.  And I'm sure next Halloween, 'Saw III' will be opening up to more packed theatres.

And you gotta smile when a little $4 million dollar('Saw II's budget)film is kicking the crap out of so-called $100 million dollar blockbusters in the box office receipts.  So just sit back and enjoy the violence.",1131753600,2,2111,4.636118598382749
1870576,2,B00008YOD2,"I liked the first Saw movie, even though it was gruesome and insane in many ways, it provided for some nail biting entertainment.

This movie did not deliver to my expectations. During many scenes I was thinking to myself ""I cant believe im seeing soemone die like this"" yet the brutal scenes were shot with this extra speed, and too many camera angles that it looked like a cheap crappy movie that had to disorient the audience so that stuff looked scarrier than it was.

Overall after finishing it I was not scared, tired of sitting @ the edge of my seat and not at all impressed.

The characters, although there were  many more of them, were all anoying and not likable,  and they did not want to work togehter, the stor was falling into Jigsaw's puzzles way too easily, they did whatever he wanted and it was too formulated, too much of a movie setup way, and if things didn't go the waay the script writer made the character act, this whole plan would not have worked out! Too many holes and fabrications!

Also they were locked up in some sort of a room setup and there were not many palces and things for them to figure out, there would be a door and a timer and a stupid task. The first movie was soo much more creative!

I didn't like it but then its me, I was expecting something more clever, more menacing, it fizzled but it was nothing like the first movie. And the ending wasn't so shocking, more like ""oh who cares"".

For don't we live in a world where everybody expects everybody to do and act the way we want them too?  Don't we all at some point ostracize people for being a little off o r out of place?  The freaks call the beautiful stuck up, and the beautiful pay no attention to the ugly.  We flip off the guy who cuts us off and we hate him because he inconvenienced us for one small moment.  We're all guilty of doing somebody wrong, and then when we are wronged we expect the other person to apologize.  We want vengeance, and we want the world to think and act just like us.  If not we hate them.  Trust me we're all guilty at some point, even I am

That is just one of the wild thoughts that permeated my mind while sitting through SAW II. Yes, I'll admit it's odd that I would have a somewhat religious epiphany while people are hacking themselves to pieces.  But that's the beauty of Horror.  It's about processing the horror into something productive, while enjoying the scares.

The Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bond) is back.  This time he's locked a bunch of people in a gory fun-ouse of his own design.  The house is slowly filling with a gas that will kill the inhabitants unless they can find the antidote.  One of the Jigsaw Killers victims is the son of Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), a local cop.  Matthews and the local swat team have the Jigsaw Killer in their grasp.  What follows is  a psychological game that matches the law with a man whose unafraid to die.

SAW II is one of those rare sequels that works because you get to find out more about the psychopath.  In this film we get to delve into the mind of the Jigsaw Killer (who goes by the name of John), see a little more about why and how he operates.  Tobin Bond keeps him creepy and yet charismatic enough to be believable.  Like a poor mans Hannibal Lecter there is a method and meaning to his madness but he's not a cartoon.  He's a man on his deathbed with nothing to lose, and a theory of life that is so practical that if he channeled his concepts into motivational speaking and not murder and carnage he could be a millionaire.

I liked that the movie didn't play fast and loose with the carnage and at the same time realized when enough was enough.  In this PG-13 Horror movie world it's so easy to pull back to reach a younger audience.  But SAW II is smart enough to raise the bar, and let you process the mystery.  Whose holding the cards?  Is it the Jigsaw Killer?  Is it the cops?

I also thought the ensemble in the house worked well together, I just wish the screenplay had given them more to do than just stumble around and scream at each other.  I also thought the stunning revelation about ""X marking the spot"" came far to late for the characters to really care about who was in the picture.  When your life is almost over you're not really worrying about who put you in jail.

Director Darren Lynn Bousman tries his dandiest not to make the same mistakes of the first film, by laying off the camera tricks in favor actually allowing the actors to act.  Sure he wiggles the camera around a little, adds some quick cuts to places.  But he doesn't use those devices to amplify action that's boring.  My one little qualm was with the screenplay.  I liked the stuff in the house so much more than the police procedural parts.  I wished that the movie had delved into the whole numbers thing and the mysteries of the people in the house a little more.

SAW II is engrossing if you let it be.  On the surface it could be construed as just another slasher knock-off.  But the power lies in the Jigsaw character and how and why he's manipulating the background.  It's also a film that explores our own dark side.  Jigsaw's real beef with the people in the story is that their wasting their lives.  Their killing their bodies, they're hurting other, and their tearing their families apart.  But the truth lies in the fact that legalism, and your own pursuit to change another persons thinking can also be skewed.

1870610,5,B00008YOD2,"I remember seeing the first one, and it grossed my parents out. Then, I rented it many times and finally prepared for Saw II. So I saw it on friday and loved it! here's a review.

The movie is about a detective who is solving a murder commited by Jigsaw. Then Jigsaw traps a few unlucky people in a shelter, who must try to get out before they breathe too much lethal nerve gas and die! THen, they find a recording by Jigsaw, telling them that they have to find an antidote to get out.

I loved this film. sick, twisted, every bit as good as the first, it's all so good. SO any gorehound (not necissarily) must see this film.

And BTW, It's already Number one at the box office. LEt's see if it can keep up!",1130976000,,707,4.108695652173913
1870611,4,B00008YOD2,"Wow. After seeing all of the negative reviews roll in, with only a couple good ones, I was kind of worried about Saw II. It didn't exactly have the best track record. The script started as the director's own script that had absolutely nothing to do with the Saw universe. And then when Lion's Gate decided to make a sequel they found this script and thought it could fit into the universe, so they gave it to the original screenwriter and he took a stab (pun not intended but I'll go with it) at making it work for their sequel. Normally when you have a script and then have other people work on it, you get a conflict of interest and the script falls apart. See Jurassic Park 3 and its huge list of screenwriters to get an idea of that.

BUT! I thought this movie was great for a couple of reasons. A lot of times, with sequels, you could simply switch in a different villain and name the movie Bob's House of Horror and it would work. I mean, seriously, the Jason movies? The Michael Myer movies? Change those guys with someone else and it would work. There's no real connection outside of the killer to the series. And then there are movies that are intricately connected. The Scream trilogy is. Not saying that all three Scream movies are great, but they are intricately connected. A good sequel acknowledges the first movie and then finds a way to change how you viewed it. It changes things, raises the stakes and makes you rethink what happened in the first film. Scream 2 and 3 did this and so does Saw II.

The big worry for me going into Saw II was that it would be there simply to cash in on the success of Saw. Sure, the Jigsaw killer would be there, up to his old tricks. But that would be it. It'd be another Jason, another Michael Myers. I'm happy to report that is not the case. Instead it is connected at a fundamental level to the first one. It answers some lingering questions about the killer, it brings in a character from the first one and it...well I don't want to spoil it.  There are a couple twists.  I saw the majority of them coming.  The big one lacked the punch of the first one's dead body on the floor, but it definitely was more realistic and fit in perfectly with the story.  It was a good twist, but it didn't make my jaw drop.

It is incredibly gory. Incredibly. I don't think overall its as intense as the first film, it definitely has its cringe-worthy moments. There is a scene toward the end that mimicks the nominal scene from the first film (not in the same way but its definitely an homage to it) that I almost didn't watch. I did the kind of squint your eyes so you can just barely see it manuever. Thinking about it makes me shudder.

But what Saw I did, Saw II does bigger and better for the most part.  The characters were more fully developed, the dialogue was better and the production values were higher.  It was nice, after the first film's 18 days of filming, that they spent more time and money getting it right.  The premise still can't live up to the original with the two people chained in a room, without knowing where they are or who they are with set up. That scene is so claustrophobic, so intense that just making it 8 people in a house doesn't do it justice.  In fact, it wasn't as intense as the first one.  More in your face and bloody, yes.  But the adrenaline run from the last 30 minuts of the first film was never quite reached in this one.  However, it is definitely a worthy sequel. It didn't feel rushed. It felt fully composed. And, above all, it was good.

Just remember, if you ever get stuck in a Jigsaw situation, for God's sake, follow the rules!",1130889600,4,3623,4.298091042584435

He has kidnapped some people and imprisoned then in an old house.  Poisonous gas is being pumped into the house and Mason only has two hours to find them before the gas kills them all.  To make matters worse, one of the trapped is his son.

""Saw II"" is a worthy successor to last year's surprise hit ""Saw"".  Tobin Bell is excellent as Jigsaw, this time full and center and interacting with Wahlberg's Mason.  He is a creepy little man suffering from terminal cancer who just wants to teach others to appreciate what they have.  Unlike most horror movies, he gives good insight into the killer's motives.  The twist at the end is slightly more satisfying than the original's, and the gore and violence is about the same.

1870613,1,B00008YOD2,"Ok I did see the first one.  And that one bored me to death.  I've seen the ""psychological horror"" cliche a million times.  Gore for gore sakes bores me, so it really doesn't matter how much blood is spilt the first time or the second time around.  I look at this film and films like it and I have to wonder to myself, why watch a movie who's only sake in living is to show death?...I mean really...the Jigsaw killer's desire is to explain to the victims that life is important?  Of course most of the victims never live to see the ""grand scheme of things"".  So that writes off that appeal.  People getting torn, ripped, shot at, slammed...yes, I guess great special effects, but nothing you haven't seen if you prefer movies like SEVEN or The Cell or even Silence of the Lamb.  The only reason this movie exists is so that more gory scenes can be conceived just to panhandle the desires of people who only like violence for the sake of violence.  If I wanted to explore violence, I'd watch FOX news and see reports concerning everything from Katrina to the War on Terror.  The story line is written to fit the violence, not the violence used metaphorically to explore the grander development of a storyline.  Like I said, violence for violence sake is popular, but really, there's better horror movies out there that try to develop actual characters to explore fear and uncertainty (such as the badly titled movie, Boo, great movie, scary movie, but bad bad bad name).  Then again, Saw isn't the best of names either.",1130803200,4,1518,4.540441176470588

When I first saw Saw I was convinced there would never be another film like it, and so far that's true because Saw II is in now way a carbon copy of it's predesesor.  I also said there would never be another horror film to top it.  I was wrong because it's sequel, in one of those never heard of strokes of genious has actually exceeded all expectations and become a better scare ride, a better film than Saw.  I guess the reason to me this film rose above is that the premise allows for a much tenser ride.  The fact that there is a group of strangers trapped in a house full of traps for them with every turn causes this uneasy air to come over the veiwer.  I will say that even though you don't have to have seen Saw to appreciate Saw II, it does help...a lot.  That said, the premise is this...The Jigsaw is at it again.  The opening scene is as chilling as they come and sets the tone for this thrill ride.  Donny, Marky-Marks brother plays a cop whose son is part of the jigsaws new experiment.  Trapped in a house with a bunch of ex-cons, the house full of nerve gas that will kill them all in 2 hours time, this 15 year old kid or so has to try and survive amidst a group of crackheads and killers.  There are antidotes hidden throughout the house, the only problem is these antidotes are guarded by deadly traps and games including a key hidden in a pit of syringes and a furnice.  The deaths are intence and the overall feel of the film is edge of your seat intesity.  WATCH THIS FILM and enjoy because unless Saw III is another surprise treat you won't get this originality from a horror film for a long time to come.",1130803200,2,1719,4.157099697885196
1870615,5,B00008YOD2,"I find it funny reading review on ""horror movies"".  The term has been so watered down by the press and split into so many sub geners that there isn't really a true horror film anymore.  And you have stupid kids who think they know what they are talking about.  For instance, while I was standing in line for Saw 2, some child behind me said something that blew my mind.  ""There is no way this is going to beat House of Wax, that was awesome"".  Now mind you, I'm old school.  House of Wax, with Vincet Price, is a classic.  Even though it is a remake it still awesome.  So I had a feeling he was talking about that god awful piece of crap that just came out.  And he sure helped me prove me point, ""Paris Hilton is such a good actress"".  I wasn't sure if I should beat this kid, cry, or laugh histerically.  But I dismissed it and got ready for a ride.

This one played things slightly differently.  (Semi - spolier here) The first movie had Jigsaw in the background and it kept you guessing who he was.  This one, they came right out in the beginning and showed him and made this movie a little bit more psychological.  The psychological factor is important, because they use it throughout the movie.  And most of it is subtle and subliminal.

(Pardon the terrible pun here) The final few scenes are jaw dropping.  Let me put it to you this way, the whole theater was cheering by this point.  Saw 2 does not play around.  It clearly takes it's self seriously and makes the viewer think about what they are seeing, instead of having an orgy of visuals that go nowhere (*cough* House of Wax).  And just to mess with all of the haters of this series, they set up for a third installment, which rumor has it, is already being discussed and ready for pre-production.

So to the fans of Saw, you will dig this one, and be rewarded for paying attention.  For the haters, House of Wax came out on DVD about two weeks ago, so get your full screen ""unrated"" version and stay home.  For the rest of us, enjoy Saw 2, I know I did.",1130803200,4,2018,4.2362204724409445
1870616,4,B00008YOD2,"I wasn't sure about this one.  They seemed to want to rush a quick sequel out the door with a new writer and director.  I am glad to say that this movie is very good.  Though it uses much of what made the first movie effective, it also has a differant feel to it.  The victims are confimed to an entire house as opposed to one room.  Also, you see a great deal of Jigsaw in this one and learn a lot of his back story.  The twist at the end seemed to confuse a few people in the audience, but it is not hard to understand if you pay attention.  This film will be fun to watch a second time now that I know the ending to try and pick up all the clues that were left.  Continues the story nicely and worth your time and money.",1130803200,5,723,3.8378378378378377
1870617,4,B00008YOD2,"Well, here it is. Just one year after the original ""Saw"" was a surprise hit, ""Saw II"" has arrived, and rather swiftly at that. I was kind of skeptical walking into the theater about whether or not this movie could live up to the first one. Afterall, sequels that are put out this quickly tend to lack in quality (especially when it comes to the horror genre). But rest assured, ""Saw II"" definitely delivers. In typical sequel fashion, it ups the ante on gore, the cast is bigger, the jumps are higher and the story more complicated. Just like the first movie, it is whip-smart and will keep you guessing right until the very end.

Now, I'm not gonna pretend that this movie is perfect. While it is obviously better than 99 percent of the ""horror"" movies out today (and the fact that it isn't a remake earns it bonus points) it still does suffer in a few parts. The main point being that the cast is too large, and in turn, hardly any of the characters are developed to the point where the audience really cares. Half of what made ""Saw"" so good was the dynamic between Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell, whose characters were fleshed out really well and truly carried the movie. Here, the cast is tripled, and when you cram them into a 90 minute time slot, there just isn't much time to get to know them. Donnie Wahlberg as the bad cop/bad father and Tobin Bell as ""John"" are the standouts and both are absolutely brilliant in the film. The other actors were good, but just not enough screen time. Also, the torture/death scenes -- while inventive -- were a little predictable. You see what's going to happen before you're supposed to. Even still though, the plot (which was written once again by Whannell) twists and turns so many times and keeps you on your toes the whole way. This is really one movie where you're not gonna want to step out to the bathroom. Each bit of dialogue is crucial. Like the original, this one is a giant jigsaw puzzle that only makes sense in the final minutes. Director Darren Lynn Bousman is a perfect successor to James Wan, despite the fact that most of his experience lies in music videos. The man handles this film with much class and style. It looks and feels just like the first one did -- without coming off as a retread (the tie-in to the original at the end of the movie was a nice touch, by the way).

Overall, despite it's few flaws, ""Saw II"" is the must-see movie this Halloween season. If you loved the first, you'll want to check this out. I guarantee it will surprise you and will leave you walking out with so many questions and so much to talk about. And not to give anything away, but there is definitely room left for ""Saw III"" -- which is already in the works. Hopefully next Halloween we can look forward to having our nerves fried once again.",1130716800,6,2791,4.41747572815534
1870618,3,B00008YOD2,"- REVIEW

Last year, film critic/journalist Richard Roeper said, in a negative remark, that the first ""SAW"" was a glorified Snuff film.  Now, if he were to say the same thing in ""SAW II"", I would actually agree with him.  I don't mean to offend to the fans, because I was one of the people that LOVED the first movie.  I wasn't completely anticipated for the sequel, because, like every other horror sequel in the making, everything about this films screams out 'MORE': more blood, more body count, more yelling, and more of those N.I.N.-style cinematography; all more...of the similar stuff I've seen from the last film.  The only reason I felt to see this film is because I used the ""FREE SAW 2"" movie ticket when I bought the ""SAW Uncut"" DVD.

As far as horror sequels go, this movie was a little better than I expected, and it could've gotten a lot worse.  It's been exactly a year since I've seen the first ""SAW"" and a couple months for ""SAW II"" since the last film too place, and now the movie got a NKOTB member to take care of the job.  Donnie Wahlberg plays a detective on a case to find the Jigsaw killer after his informant recently was ""played"" by one of Jigsaw's games.  For those who've seen the first film, we all known the twist of who the Jigsaw killer really is, and it didn't take long for the detective and his crew to find his hideout.  Unfortunately for the detective, the Jigsaw killer, aka John (Tobin Bell), already has another game set up for another set of victims, one of which is the detective's son.  It's unusual in a way that John, who really is weak by a Terminal Cancer, would still have the strength to acquire the victims; is there someone else involved?

Anyway, the eight victims of the game are being locked up in a mansion filled with a deadly nerve gas that would kill them in two hours if they don't find the antidotes found in deadly places.  Frankie G's character (wait, wasn't he in ""Jonny Zero?"") ain't too happy about his sitch and doesn't mind expressing his rage at somebody; of course, any guy whose the star of a show that was cancelled after five episodes has a good reason to be angry.  One of the surprising victims in the game is Amanda, who was the only survivor of one of the Jigsaw's games, who's back to play his game once again; what purpose does she have of being here?

These two and the rest (including a token) need to cooperate in order to survive his game, but knowing horror films, that's never gonna happen, and during moments of devastation, they'll kill each other in order to survive (reminds me of ""Battle Royale"").  It's a time of survival for the group, and for the detective who uses his inner ""Badboy Donny"" to coerce the Jigsaw to help him find the victims, but he has no idea that the Jigsaw is setting up another game for him.

As far as the story goes, it has all the set up for a ""Saw"" film, and is equally disturbing albeit not scary.  The reason I liked ""SAW"" was the atmospheric intensity of being part of the game, and knowing the feeling of it by the end of the movie.  Other than the first game in the beginning of ""Saw II"", I didn't feel any of that during the rest of the film, and I didn't really care of what happens to the characters.  It's probably that I've always experienced this experience before, but as I watch them get killed off one by one, there's no morbid reaction about it, as it becomes all about the gore and none of the heart-pounding situations.  (Plus, the attractive female victims get killed off less graphically than the men; strange)

Acting-wise, well, let's just saying that most of the actors' constant yelling helps their over-acting by 75%; not even Donnie's ""you can kiss this"" attitude helps him out that much.  I'm just glad Tobin Bell is the only actor that can pull off such a good role as a cancerous psychopath.  Boy, do I miss Cary Elwes already.

The best thing about the sequel is it's own twist ending.  Yes, y'all, the second ""Saw"" has ANOTHER unexpected twist for the franchise, and let me tell you, it all makes sense.  The twist filled in almost all of the gaps that some people find it implausible from the last movie, not to mention adding a homage to the first film.  Although, there IS one plot inconsistancy because of the twist.  I can't tell you what it is without spoiling it, but it has something to do with the nerve gas.  I can tell there's gonna be a ""SAW III"" in the making, along with another twist...maybe.

Even with the unexpected twist, I felt this eerie aura of dj vu surrounding me.  Plot-wise, it was slighty superior than the original, but without the shock and ghastly mood that made the first film conceptually awesome, ""Saw II"" just drags itself as it becomes annoying than it is creepy.  But then again, this IS a horror sequel, so it's no surprise that it couldn't live up to to my cult favorite. In a formal way of speaking, I was delighted with the film, but not satisfied.

This is Del Keyes, saying ""SAW it once, don't feel like seeing it again.""",1130716800,3,5011,4.4226579520697165
1870669,5,B00008YOD2,"2004's Saw was something I never thought I'd see in this day and age - a horror movie with a clever, engrossing plot that didn't center around a scantily-clad, sex-crazed co-ed cast.  It was, in my opinion, the closest anyone, with the exception of Rob Zombie with House of 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, has ever come to a horror classic in at least a decade, maybe even longer.  Can lightning strike twice?  Absolutely.

This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel builds upon the greatness of its predecessor.  The first Saw was amazing, but Saw II is phenomenal.  It boasts an even better cast, a faster pace and a chilling storyline that's by no means a stale rehash of what we saw in the original.  On top of that, the ""kill scenarios"" are even smarter and, yes, even more gruesome than what we saw a year ago.

Within the opening minutes of the movie, the Jigsaw Killer's caught.  Once he's in police custody, he engages in mind games with the main police officer, a seemingly troubled individual played by former New Kid on the Block Donny Wahlberg.  The results of these games are shocking, violent and totally unexpected.

If you liked the first Saw, you'll love this movie.  It's even better than the original.",1130630400,6,1238,4.628440366972477
1870670,4,B00008YOD2,"It is rare when a sequel can come close to the original, and I feel SAW II is nearly as good. The acting is decent all around, with no annoying Cary Elwes this time around. The traps are just as gory and there are a couple of interesting twists towards the end. I liked how we learned more about the Jigsaw killer this time around, but not enough to be comfortable when he is on screen (what a creepy villian who has nothing to lose). The final twist didn't shock me like the one in SAW, but I wasn't expecting it at all. Brutal horror flicks are becoming rare these days, and this one is just in time for Halloween.",1130630400,2,616,4.141666666666667
1870671,2,B00008YOD2,"'Oh yes, there will be blood,' Jigsaw promises.

Well about a tea-cup's worth if you're lucky. 'There will be boredom' or ""There will be headaches"" would be more appropriate tagline for this absolutely worthless, mess of a sequel. After the surprisingly great and successful original, Lionsgate immediately green-lit this movie for production and completion within less than a year. Exactly how good can a film be with such a short production schedule? The answer is not very good at all. In fact it's downright awful.

Jigsaw has returned to teach ironic lessons to those who live dull lives yet are not truly alive. Only this time he attracts the attention of a half-crazed cop (oh wait, he did that last time as well) who is so thoroughly incompetent at his job that you'll want to jump into the movie and throttle him. Jigsaw has locked a bunch of strangers in a spooky old house with nerve gas slowly killing them. He gives them loads of clues on how to escape but since they are all idiots, none of them work together and their utter stupidity only serves to force the lumbering plot along and lead to their well deserved deaths.

It's not just the bad script that kills the film, after all great filmmakers can make brilliance out of a rotten screenplay. It's the very poor editing, urine-soaked cinematography, incoherent pacing, and dumb characters that cripple the film beyond repair. First-time director Darren Lynn Bousman isn't exactly Uwe Boll, but his lack of experience behind the camera gives this entire film an amateurish, hack feel.

Wahlberg's clichd stereotype Detective is right out of a bad, 80s, bottom shelf Cop video and the people stuck in the poisonous house are just morons. The first Saw worked so well because we only had 2 victims who conversed and worked with/against each other for the whole film. We had a stronger attachment to them. And they looked for logical ways out before resorting to the painful. This time we get loads more victims with little explanation on who they are or what importance they have and they just never use their common sense.

Another thing that bogs this sequel down even more is its total reliance on condescending to the audience. Any average movie goer could figure the best way out of most of the booby-traps and death scenarios but these stupid characters just do the dumbest things so they can get killed and so film offers up another corpse for us to scream at. But not even this works. Some guy climbs into a big oven (only a retard would do this in a horror film) and is burned alive. But we don't even see anything! And when he tries to pull himself out, not only is he not even burnt, but he just dies for no apparent reason. So his feet got burnt a bit, big deal! If their were no swearing in this film, it would be a PG-13 all the way. Don't expect any of the bone-chilling scares you got first time around.

The only thing that stops Saw II from being a complete failure is the interesting, if incredibly stupid, plot twist. But is it worth suffering 90 minutes for? I would only recommend this film if you expect it to be crap, have lowered your expectations extremely far and obviously if you have the time and money to waste on it.

Overall this is a disgrace to the original. Oh and said Saw only appears for about a second and half.

The Blu-ray sports an okay 1.78:1 1080p image that has quite a few speckles to it. The sound is in loud, obnoxious DTS HD-MA, and decent amount of extras.",1130630400,,3472,4.561797752808989

Saw II is one hell of a good movie with everything clicking right. The acting is solid notably the guy who played Jigsaw. If you watched the first one and liked it, then stop reading this right now and go watch it.
This movie still has the same twists the first one did notably another great one at the end. The end sure is unpredictable and will continue this Saw franchise.
Saw II opens with a guy being trapped and receiving orders from Jigsaw. Everything goes wrong for him and he gets his face smashed. Detective Matthews is on the case. He has an argument with his son and his son runs off. Guess what. They find Jigsaw..he's still the old guy and he has cancer and is breathing on a respirator. But wait..there's something else. Inside the room they find Jigsaw, there's 4 or 5 tvs and on them..it's not pretty. There are 8 people stranded in a room. One of them is Matthew's son. They have been given a toxic gas that will kill them if they don't get an antidote.
What happens next is one hell of a good and really suspensful movie. Believe me, there are some serious gross out moments like in the first one.
The movie's cleverness and geniune creepiness comes from Jigsaw though. All that he says makes perfect sense. He makes a serious point witch is very creepy. He's like John Doe in Seven, all that he says makes sense. He says that he is only putting people in this position because they don't cherish life which is the truth. The drug dealers, the suicidal people, all of them..But if you're placed in Jigsaw's position where they tell him he's going to die, then he starts to view life differently..starts to cherish it. Every glass of water, everything. And that is what makes the movie so fascinating because you see why Jigsaw became what he is and why he's doing it. This adds to the creepiness of the movie. The huge twist given in the movie is fascinating and the twisted irony at the end is brilliant. Just pay attention to everything Jigsaw says and in the end you'll see. All he wants is for detective Matthews to listen..so remember that.
Saw II is one of the best movies of the year and I'm not talking about stupid horror like the texas chainsaw massacre. This movie is unforgettable and I will definitely watch it again. A complete must see...Saw II is a success, even comparable to the silence of the lambs and red dragon. Now that's something to say and besides the acting which is better in the silence of the lambs (by far), I think this movie is better. Now that's unbelievable. Saw II is a piece of genius..watch it.",1130544000,6,2696,4.459514170040486

This is a very different film!  First, I feel this movie can stand completely on it's own merits.  No need to see SAW first.  Second, I felt this had way more plot.  Yes, it could have developed the main characters more.  I wonder if the extended version will correct this.  You get much more of the history behind jigsaw, not that it tries to garner any sympathy....there are a couple of plots holes, but on the whole II is more clever than I by far.  Some events are predictable, but I almost feel they were put there for the audience to identify with.  You feel like YOU are playing the game!  The audience actually broke into spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, which does NOT happen much these days (at least in the movies I see)  I thought the ending could have been a little better, but if you see the movie you'll understand why they ended it the way they did.  For those who prefer their movies wrapped up in a neat bundle at the end, this movie is NOT for you!  Please don't bring your kids or siblings....one dad towed his shellshocked 8 year old out of the theater.  I'd hate to pay  for his future counseling sessions....",1130544000,4,1305,4.286885245901639

Wahlberg finds out that there are several people in a room locked up with no way out and they are breathing in a deadly nerve agent that destroys your insides and if they don't make it in time, solve the puzzles, then their all going to die. Once they escape the room, they go on a frantic spree around the house looking for ways to get out and Donnie Wahlberg is trying to get Jigsaw Killer to tell him where the people are because one of those people is his son. A perfect companion movie to the original Saw meshes well with it, notably towards the end. Wahlberg gets some credit for delivering a good performance and Tobin Bell is wonderfully creepy as The Jigsaw Killer. Fans of the first or really major horror buff fans will love the new traps that are set in the movie...with bloody effect...they love their blood those horror junkies. Some energy gets drained here and there but what keeps it alive is the ending.

The way Saw and Saw 2 are connected is brilliant. And Amanda gives a performance that would leave you speachless. The ending is incredible. You would not see it coming. A must see.",1130457600,5,373,4.328571428571428
1870678,4,B00008YOD2,"I was not originally planning to see ""Saw II"" in the theater.  ""Saw"" was the last horror film I made a point of going to see instead of just waiting for the DVD, but that was on the strength of strong reviews and since ""Saw II"" just opened today the critical and public verdicts have yet to be determined.  But then I saw the trailer and discovered that Beverly Mitchell was in the cast and that tipped the scale towards going to the first showing on the first day, because the possibility of seeing Lucy Camden Kinkirk die a horrible death in a splatter flick appeals to me (the character drives me up the wall).  I know lots of people went to go see ""House of Wax"" just to watch Paris Hilton die on screen, so it is not like I am the only sick person on the planet.

It goes without saying that your enjoyment of ""Saw II"" is predicated entirely on your having seen the original.  There is not a recap per se, but we begin with a reminder of exactly the sort of games that Jigsaw plays.  Then we are introduced to Detective Eric Mason (Donnie Wahlberg), who is brought in on the case because Jigsaw has left him a message.  Mason is one of those world-weary cops who has enough personal and professional problems without having a psycho killer playing mind games with him, so he does not want to play.  But of course Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) forces the issue as once again there are games within games within games.

So, while Jigsaw is playing his little game with the police, on the monitors we see the interiors of a house when Jigsaw has trapped a group of people like rats.  I do not need to get ahead of the movie in terms of introducing the characters beyond pointing out that we already know two of them.  One is Daniel (Erik Knudsen), who is Marsh's son, and the other is Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who has the distinction of being the only person ever to have survived one of Jigsaw's little games.  The game this time has two parts.  The first is that they are all breathing a toxic gas.  A door to the outside will open in three hours, but unless they get to an antidote they will all be dead within two (""There will be blood,"" Jigsaw promises).  The second part of the game is that each person in the house will get to play their own little personal game in an effort to get their hands on the antidote.

If you are expecting everybody to take turns playing their own personal game, then you are going to be disappointed, because that possibility disappears before they even get out of the first room.  With more than two characters playing the game we certainly do not get to know any of them as well as we did last time.  Still, ""Saw II"" plays off of the original, which is exactly what you want it to do, and one of the strengths of this film is how it finds a new way to do old things in a new way, which is also what you want it to do.  Unlike most contemporary horror films (e.g., ""Jeepers Creepers""), this one has a better payoff than a set up.  At least that is what I was thinking when I was sitting in the dark watching the end credits.  So while I do not think many people will find ""Saw II"" superior to the original, I also think most people will not be as disappointed watching ""Saw II"" as they usually are when they watch a sequel to a horror film they liked.

Director Darren Lynn Bousman (""Butterfly Dreams,"" ""Identity Lost"") co-wrote the script with Leigh Whannell, who came up with the original story for ""Saw"" and wrote the screenplay with director James Wan, and I have a complaint in that the director undercuts the writers and actors at key moments.  Take the opening sequence, where within a minute of the movie starting they have come up with a situation where you want to close your eyes rather than see what is happening on screen.  But just when you are about to close your eyes and keep them shut, editor Kevin Greutert goes into overdrive and we are at the other end of the spectrum where things are flashing by so quickly you cannot tell what you are seeing.  That strikes me as rather counterproductive for this type of a movie and is the reason I ended up rounding down on this one (and not because of what does or does not happen to Mitchell's character).  Despite that, ""Saw II"" should deliver the goods this Hallowee weekend, which is just what horror fans need to hear.",1130457600,6,4311,4.317617866004963

7988039,4,B00008YOD2,"Less tactful and more brutal, this was a very different film than part I.  Following very much the trajectory between Hellraiser (1987) and Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988), we shift from a film driven by atmosphere and characters to one of world elaboration and gorier effects.  But honestly, its a rather satisfying shift.

Show me a horror sensation and Ill show you a swiftly released sequel, and thats exactly what happened with the Saws (2004) successnot that Im complaining!  Just one year after the originals release, James Wan (The Conjuring 1-2, Insidious 1-2) stepped back to the role of executive producer and writer Leigh Whannell (Insidious 1-4, Saw I-III, Cooties) joined director Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw III-IV, The Devils Carnival, Mothers Day) for parts II and III.

At the end of Saw (2004), we watched in shock as Jigsaw (Tobin Bell; Boogeyman 2-3, Saw I-VII) stood up and strolled away after playing the unobtrusively limp centerpiece to his last death trap, leaving poor Adam (Leigh Whannell) to die in a filth-smeared bathroom.  But now with his mystique largely revealed, what will this sequel have to offer from our yet more terminally ill John Kramer (Jigsaw)?

Whereas part I was thoughtful and character-driven, this sequel replaces much of its class with crass.  More akin to a teen slasher, our victims awaken in a deadly funhouse of horrors that is more chaotically Cube (1997) than tactfully Se7en (1995). The rules are less clear, the tape player is less eerie, and our villains purpose is somewhat obscured. Im not saying I don't like it. Im simply saying that the very elements that drew many fans to part I (its subtlety) has been rather sidelined.  However, that said, we do develop Kramers motive and back story.  And while many fans adored the characters of part I, others reveled more in its brutal nature.  And its that very brutality that gets turned up quite a bit in this sequel.

As detectives Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg; Dead Silence, Saw III-IV) and Kerry (Dina Meyer; Bats, Saw II-IV, Piranha 3D) race against time to locate Kramers murder house, his victims begin to turn on one another.  The aspect of choice deciding his victims fate is less of a driving factor, now taking a back seat to their own murderous desperation.  Adding intrigue is that the only survivor (Shawnee Smith; The Blob, Saw I-III/VI, The Grudge 3) from part I has returned to play another deadly game.

Perhaps more mean-spirited, this sequel is more gruesomely cringe-worthy than its predecessor.  Theres much suicidal and self-mutilation imagery, wrist and throat cutting, impalement and skinning.  If anyone has an issue with needles, the syringe scene will make you reel.  No one even dies, yet its one of the most uncomfortable things one can watch.  Yikes!

Overall, this was a very different film than part I.  Following very much the trajectory between Hellraiser (1987) and Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988), we shift from a film driven by atmosphere and characters to one of world elaboration and gorier effects.  I miss James Wans more thoughtful influence, but honestly it remains a rather satisfying shift in style.",1505692800,,3147,5.0115384615384615
