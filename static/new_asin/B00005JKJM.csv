1439051,5,B00005JKJM,Best Jack the Ripper movie EVER!!!!Bloody good!5 stars!!!,1003536000,,57,6.25
1439052,4,B00005JKJM,"When I had seen the trailers for the film ""From Hell"" I'd expected it to be good. Was it good? Yes. As good as I hoped it would be? No. But it is still a damned fine mystery-horror-thriller that incorperates romance and drama into the story as well.
The story follows Inspector Fredrick Abberline as he begins his investigation of the infamous Whitechapel murders, perpetrated by the shadowy, never-caught Jack the Ripper. During the course of the investigation, he has precognitive visions that lead him deeper into the mystery, as he tries to save the beautiful prostitutes who are being viciously murdered, and are somehow linked to a massive conspiracy. He even begins to fall in love with Mary Kelly, who would be the Ripper's final victim.
The performance of Johhny Depp as Inspector Abberline is overall an excellent performance from an actor who always takes notoriously quirky roles. Heather Graham came off rather well as Mary Kelly--much better than I thought she would be. Robbie Coltrane plays the part of the Inspector's sidekick, Sgt. Godley, extremely well, and he manages to steal all of his scenes. Another wonderful portrayal is that of Ian Holm as the royal physician Sir William Gull, who assists Inspector Abberline and may have a key to the mystery. Supporting performances are all pulled off very well.
The set design and visual effects are gorgeous and haunting, giving a vivid presentation of 1888 London(the visuals rival even those of Tim Burton). The murders are left more to the imagination rather than being very explicit--but the onscreen gore effects are decidedly gruesome. Even the music by Trevor Jones is haunting in the simple, dark textual feel that it gives off.
The story itself is overall good. The first 3/4ths are quite ingenious, but in the very end of the film is not what I expected and I was a little disappointed in the resolution and conclusion of the tale. The Ripper's identity and motive were excellent, even when kept faceless in the shadows. But the as the climax builds up, it seems to be running out of steam. My only major gripe is how complicated the story gets as it progresses--adding in the conspiracy and the romance, it just seems unable to hold its own weight, building up to nothing. Although this can be accounted by trying to stick close to the source material and history itself, the conclusion is not wholly satisfying.
But overall this is a good movie that will undoubtedly become a favorite among Ripper fans, as well as fans of ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". If you can tolerate its massive complexity and the rather limp ending, then you will find this an entertaining and enjoyable--and rather nasty--little pleasure.",1003536000,72,2697,4.890829694323144
1439053,3,B00005JKJM,"It seems as if people have already started writing reviews for the film before they have even seen it! I'm not quite sure I understand that, but, they may do as they please. I HAVE seen this film. ""From Hell"" from the very first shot sets up a mood, a certain feeling, that carries threw-out the rest of the film. The movie captivates us to another time in history. 1888, London to be exact. The movie is stunningly filmed by Peter Deming. The whole film has a feeling of mystery to it. There's a contemptuous feeling in the air. This is what makes ""From Hell"" work. The cinematography, the costume designs by Kym Barrett, the production designs by Martin Childs, the art direction by Mark Reggett, and finally the music by Trevor Jones and Marilyn Manson. All of these people play an enormous role in the film's success. ""From Hell"" is best described as a wickedly evil nightmare. There's a demonic energy in the directing by the Hughes Brothers. They have, or at least in this film, a subtle approach to what they do. Before I go on with my review, I want to point out to everyone before they go see this movie, this is not for the faint of heart. Many will call this a ""difficult"", ""disturbing"", and vile movie. But, then again, when dealing with a movie about Jack the Ripper, what were you expecting? An ""Once Upon A Time"" beginning and a ""Happily ever after"" ending?! If you have childern, don't make this movie part of your ""family night"" unless your childern are at least teenagers, don't take them to see this. The film consist of scenes dealing with violence and gore. Bodies are mutilated. If you think you can stand it, and actually want to see a movie with these sort of graphic scenes, ""From Hell"" will not let you down.
The movie stars Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's a detective who has an unusual gift for sometimes being able to ""dream"" the next step Jack the Ripper will take, and for that matter, the next step any murderer will take. At first very little is known about whom they are dealing with. Is it one person? Or is it local thugs who act like pimps? Only after Frederick (Depp, who's had a very good year, First with ""Blow"" and now this) meets Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, who needed this movie to come along after the awful ""Say It Isn't So!)and Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) does everything start to take shape for him. Also Robbie Coltrane has a co-starring part in a way giving the film a certain comic relief. I'm not quite sure as to just how badly this character was needed. But despite that, the acting is enjoyable. The characters don't have much depth to them, but, there is the level of intrigue to the film that keeps you going along with it. If you are interested in Jack the Ripper and think you can stand some of the scenes I've mentioned, I think ""From Hell"" will be worth the price of admission.",1003449600,,2856,4.462715105162524
1439054,5,B00005JKJM,"studying and researching Jack the Ripper since I received the nickname by my 6th grade teacher. She named me that because I used to knock people out. Not like Jack did, but I did it with my fists. I used to be a bully. But since then I have found Jack to be quite astonishing. I am really looking forward to seeing this movie. I am definitely going on the first day. Heather Graham is one hot cookie. God I can't wait. Go! Jack! Go!",1002844800,,432,4.094117647058823
1439055,5,B00005JKJM,"i expect this film to ba amazing.  i've been intrigued with jack the ripper since 8th grade and a trip to london where i went on a ""jack the ripper walk"" where i was actually standing on the spot where they found one of the victims.  i believe that heather graham is playing Mary Kelly who is the only victim of Jack's that they actually have a picture of.  it's a rather gruesome pic.  but johnny depp, and heather graham should prove to be an excellent team.  Johnny Depp plays an investigator who has some psychic abilities and that sees some of the victims before they are killed.  he winds up meeting and falling in love with one of them (heather graham), mary kelly (i think that's who she plays, i'm not really sure), and that is what the movie is about.  i will warn you though this movie is gauranteed not to have a happy ending because jack was never caught.  he crossed the boundaries between the two london precincts and the two offices refused to cooperate, so he was never caught.  they also had no idea who he was, though there's an excellent book about it, the title of which i can't remember at the moment, but it's quite good.",1000598400,4,1144,4.3584905660377355
1439056,5,B00005JKJM,"If, you've seen previews for from hell, you'll know this about the most famous killer of all time Jack the Ripper.

1439109,3,B00005JKJM,"I'm not sure where to start. Its a decent movie based ""Loosely"" on the Alan Moore graphic novel of the same name. That said, it's kind of all over the place. I understand it's not really suppose follow the book exactly, as few book/movie adaptions do. However, if you never read the book, you might be pretty lost. I would say, as someone that Did read it, I was able to follow along & would recommend that it is probably much better having done that, than Not. There are definitely things in the movie you just aren't going to ""get"", if you haven't. -
 Read the book 1st. You'll have a better understanding of the movie for sure. I could see this movie getting terrible reviews from folks that did not.",1512172800,,703,4.366412213740458

1439113,5,B00005JKJM,"Sorry...but this review contains Spoilers! This is a real sleeper of a movie starring Johnny Depp & Heather Graham. Both gave stellar performances, as well as the always witty Robbie Coltrane. The premise that the blame for Jack the Ripper was related to the Royals' dalliances & the Freemason's preservation of the Royals reputation was quite an interesting take on the Ripper story as a whole. I quite enjoyed it & wouldn't find it surprising if most of it were true. Anyway, good movie to watch & get a take on the London 'unwashed' world versus the London 'posh' world.",1509753600,5,573,4.74

1439176,4,B00005JKJM,This is one of my favorite Johnny Depp film's. The movie is based on a graphic novel about Jack The Ripper and a lead inspector working on the case. The film is fictional in some parts because it theorizes who Jack The Ripper was. Still it's a really good film and it's beautifully photographed.,1485648000,3,295,4.481481481481482

1439208,5,B00005JKJM,"Combines many of the theories surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders. It takes place in the Whitechapel district of London, an area crawling with all manner of vice, in the autumn of 1888. Sets are convincing (shot in authentic Victorian setting), and characters are brought to life via fine acting combined with Victorian dress and accents. For example, Johnny Depp is very convincing as the chief investigator, Inspector Abberline, who receives advance information about the Ripper's grisly murders in the form of psychic dreams (and with the assistance of opium-based laudinum). I won't spoil the ending by telling you more. I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times, still enjoy watching it and recommend it.",1483920000,6,720,5.162393162393163

1439269,3,B00005JKJM,"I am fascinated with the story of Jack the Ripper and all things Victorian; however, casting on this film seems odd. Heather Graham could have found better projects I think.

1439270,5,B00005JKJM,"Johnny Depp is simply stunning in this take on Jack the Ripper. Depp plays a detective in London in the Whitechapel district that is not only believable, but realistic and sympathetic at a time when there was not much sympathy happening for the desperate poor in London. It has a supernatural edge to it, while not probably realistic historically, nevertheless entertains and gives meaning to what was probably meaningless crimes. This is not a realistic movie, but we simply do not know who Jack the Ripper was, and so why not speculate that it may have been part of a Masonic cult with supernatural powers acquired through rituals that are not fully explained, but don't need to be. It's interesting that it gives a glimpse into the fully corrupt British system at the time, and the terrible feeling that anybody who did not have money was not worth a shilling. Not a good time in British history, but I have to say it's one of my favorite Jack the Ripper tales. I gave it five stars because it really is a fantastic movie and worth watching.",1470441600,2,1044,4.618279569892473
1439271,4,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is based on a comic book or graphic novel really and I have it actually but just haven't had the time to read it honestly, I started to but then got interrupted by something I wanted to read more. So I can't compare this to the book as it were, but as a stand alone movie about Jack the Ripper it's very good.
I think the majority of people know who and what Jack the Ripper was, well supposedly we really don't know 'who' he was but this version of the story gives us the reveal as to who the killer is and why he did what he did and why he did it to those he did it to and it works as one theory. It's more of conspiracy theory though, and it's not bad. It gives us a motive behind the killings, one that we might accept and understand instead of it being just someone killing because they enjoy it or want to do it. The story tells use he wasn't just a deranged killer killing just because, yes I guess he was deranged but it seems he had a reason to do it here.
Depp offers a great performance as the head detective, Abberline, investigating the Ripper murders, but he has to contend with forces in the government and 'secret societies' that are working against him in his pursuit of the truth. The detective is a flawed man, he's realistic, he's driven to find the killer even more when he realizes there are those trying to stop him.
I guess Grahm works as Mary Kelly, but personally I don't care for the 'happy ending' they gave her. Mary Kelly was the last Ripper victim supposedly but here she goes on to live happily ever after as it were. I don't know but I just really didn't care for Mary Kelly here and I guess that's on Grahm's performance, I just didn't find her all that likable even though they tried to make her that.
In all From Hell is good interpretation of the Jack the Ripper lore, but it's more theory than anything I think, just one theory anyway as I don't think we'll ever know the true motivations or identity of Jack the Ripper.
The movie is gory to a point but more is left to the imagination than actually showing it on screen.
It's a decent addition to my collection for sure, I very much enjoy horror movies and that's what this falls under surely, it's simplistically a slasher film but there's a lot more to it than that and that's where it works well.",1470355200,2,2298,4.201357466063349

1439384,3,B00005JKJM,"DVD transfer is very good to excellent.  It's sharp, clear and in widescreen format.

From Hell suffers from some rather uninteresting characters.  Inspector Abberline (Depp) is portrayed as an opium addict who passes time between trips to the smoking dens by boozing with laudanum-laced Absinthe.  It's hard to imagine how he works at all.  Well, he does have visions.  The overall cast is excellent, just not blessed with an imaginative script.  Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins in the Ring movies) and Robbie Coltrane (Haggrad from Harry Potter), Heather Graham and Ian Richardson round out the troop.

The movie does follow history to some extent and arrives at a popular historical culprit in someone close to the Royal family.  It's decent viewing for adults, not children.  It will work for the first viewing but then you have the DVD and what to do with it now....have fun.",1453248000,3,872,4.951724137931034

While the production values were fine, the way things came off reminded me too much of History Channel dramatizations. I'd put that down to overacting on the part of the supporting cast; Heather Graham and Johnny Depp were fine, as was the directing. I must admit that I ended up returning the disc early to get to the next one in my queue.

It is the late nineteenth century, and the inspector, who has somewhat clairvoyant powers, is addicted to dope. He not only tries to find the murderer, but also tries unsuccessfully to protect the prostitutes he is killing. The inspector falls in love with one of the prostitutes. The film is filled with doctors who cut into people's brains to control their behavior, cover-ups, masons, the crown prince, the queen, lesbians, and anti-Semites. An event occurs that can rip the English empire in pieces. The film explains why the ripper was never found.",1437696000,2,774,4.871212121212121

1439593,5,B00005JKJM,"Although much of this movie is conjecture, it still is excellent if one suspends disbelief.  The conjectured involvement of Queen Victoria and a
Royal doctor is well-thought-out and makes a more convincing explanation than many books I have read on the subject.  The only problem is the visual portrayal of the victims.  From  surviving photographs and drawings of the actual victims, they  could best be described charitably as pitiful-looking (diseased, ungroomed, and repulsive).  However, as this is nonfiction-fiction (to allude to Capote), the liberties taken with appearances are all right here.  Ms. Graham, who plays the last victim, is most ravishingly beautiful with her somewhat pale skin and coppery red hair--stunningly pre-Raphaelite in appearance.  Although Elizabeth Siddal, Rossetti's wife died c. 1860 (22 years before the Ripper), Ms. Graham closely resembles her as depicted in many paintings and drawings.  Her appearance and role alone make watching this film worthwhile.",1427846400,,994,5.617449664429531

From Hell (2001) stars Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.  This movie is loosely based on the book of the same name.  This movie is about the story of Jack The Ripper, only with a twist or two added.  I find this movie dark, dreary, violent, gory, gruesome, mysterious, and of all around high quality.  The dark atmosphere, the settings, the city of London, the fog, the mysteriousness, the dreariness...it all works, not to mention some good camera angles.  The acting is very good, especially by Depp.  In addition, the musical score fits the movie very well.

If you want to see a high quality take on the Jack The Ripper story, then I recommend From Hell.",1418688000,3,762,4.626865671641791
1439708,5,B00005JKJM,"Very interesting version of the Ripper story, mixing facts with fiction in a believable way. Johnny  Depp is super as the brooding inspector using his dream-like visions to pursue the infamous killer. Very good supporting cast all around. The movie is excellent at capturing what the dreary underworld of London must have been like, no holds barred. Everyone knows some version of the Ripper story, but this movie still manages to create mystery and suspense.",1418169600,2,459,5.12

The actions centers on the Yorkshire Ripper, a killer in the Whitechapel district of London. He was never caught, and the film makers give a theory about who they think may have done it. The ending is surprising, and I enjoyed the variation on this urban legend. Good viewing here!

1439749,3,B00005JKJM,OK,1413417600,,2,2.0
1439750,4,B00005JKJM,"As none of of us was actually there to see it, the Victorian urban jungle, horror buffs may savor this contemporary dramatization of his hunting grounds, the notorious ""Ripper"", Jack.  There's no vampires or magics to mull over here.  Rather, it's focus is a dedicated Scotland Yard detective who employs unusual methods.  The prototype serial-killer mystery, featuring well presented discussion of the existing evidence.  The ""Ripper"" was known for leaving tell-tale clues of his caste, among society's privileged wealthy.  Rather more cryptic references pointed to his association with a secret society.

Out front, I should point out that I'm not enamored with the Jack sparrow role for Johnny Depp.  He's been very discriminating in his selection of diverse and interesting characters to portray.  Here, his Scotland Yard position is almost anti-heroic.  But in the end, the understanding of his character is superb.

The villain, when ultimately unmasked delivers his performance with righteous manic zeal.  And without dropping any spoilers, he's a brilliant reversal of roles from other famous characters in his portfolio.  The suspense is well measured.  And despite the violent nature of the crimes, the viewer is only exposed to one enactment of a slashed throat.  While all of the victims were prostitutes, the desperation of their occupation isn't overly embellished.  Viewers are treated to only one vulgar alleyway scene, staged primarily as a precursor to illustrating her as the intended prey in her native environment.

One cannot mentally entertain the human drama of this story without a certain detachment from the most gruesome particulars of the murders.  Murders most foul, and terrifying.  Yet I believe this film succeeds in preserving some humanity of the characters.  I was allowed to care about them and the reality of their circumstances.  I appreciated an unexpected turn of events in the conclusion of this script.",1413072000,3,1945,5.356435643564357

This movie is about Jack the Ripper and the story comes very close to what they can describe of what he was about, and why he murdered prostitutes in London during 1886. Obviously Jack was a evil possessed individual and a very sick. Its very graphic and not recommended for young viewers but that was Jack the Ripper and I enjoyed this movie.",1392422400,,574,4.637254901960785

Well done, but that may be an issue -- a bloody, nasty theme done well -- some might say this is not good.  Nonetheless, if the topic and blood do not bother you, worth watching for its ""redeeming social value,"" to quote the Supreme Court (on sex movies, of course, but I apply it here to violent movies as well).",1391904000,,484,4.404494382022472

1440081,3,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is a sobering, depressing movie with beautiful, classy coloring, a unique twist on an intriguing tale, a well-done cast, and some effective imagery. In short, stay away if you only like fluffy violent flicks.

 The setting is 1888 in London, England. The streets are poor and things desperate. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is one of a small group of prostitutes being continuously threatened by the Nichol's Street gang. They want heir cut of the girls profits and refusal means a slice and dice job. Terrified, they turn to their friend who has landed herself a wealthy husband for help. But before the woman can assist, she's grabbed, kidnapped, and lobotomized while her infant is left behind and husband dragged off.

 Soon a mutilated prostitute's body is found and Detective Fred Abberline, played by the talented and gorgeous horror staple Johnny Depp, is called to investigate alongside his quirky, likable partner. They arrive to find a ""professional"" disembowelment and removal of female organs. Also...grapes. The good inspector has a sort of psychic vision thing going on that pulls forward some pretty bizarre scenarios. His having trouble getting over the death of his beloved in childbirth and also is addicted to opium, called in this movie ""chasing the dragon,"" proves to be interesting.

 More bodies pop up from the street and Abberline gets together with Kelly to question her about anything she may know. Of course reluctant to talk to the authorities, she takes awhile to warm up, and in the meantime a doctor is called into the picture, an ex-surgeon with a crippling condition who tries and loan his assistance to the police.

 Between the quick shots of mangled bodies after getting to know the people killed, horrifying experimental lobotomies that render the person helpless for life, the morgue with the funny but overwhelmed mortician and the autopsy details, the turn out blew me away. This movie isn't meant to merely entertain but to unsettle on a deeper level.

 This particular scripts version is creative and while very far out there is plausible and makes a bizarre type of sense. The deaths become more brutal as it goes along. Most aren't really shown but as the ending draws nearer we get a nasty and realistic slashed throat and an ending that shows how unstable Jack the Ripper really was.

 A well directed, produced, acted film but stay away if you're not into dark flicks that neither begin or end on a happy note.",1379635200,,2467,4.932367149758454

I feel that this is one of Depp's better roles especially compared to the 'out there' feel of his Jack Sparrow persona.  The tone and feel of the movie was very atmospheric and I felt nailed the feel of the movie completely.  While I would have loved to see a much closer version of the graphic novel put to film, it would probably have to have been split up or even a mini-series deal.  Bottom line if you are looking for a creepy atmospheric film with some great performances, give this a shot but if you live and die by the graphic novel you might be disappointed in this version",1370304000,,649,4.252032520325203

1440246,4,B00005JKJM,"First and foremost, this tale of Jack the Ripper was torn from a comic book and not by the whims of historical accuracy.  With that in mind, it isn't half bad.  The story unfolds with the murders of whores that live in the Whitechapel district of London in 1888.  London, at the time, is a growing metropolis with little social decorum as everyone is out for themselves.  As the aristocracy sits pretty in their palaces and homes, the lower classes suffer and women are forced into whoring themselves out for money.  This is where Jack the Ripper comes into play.

History describes Jack the Ripper as a malevolent, smart, meticulous serial killer who targeted women who were prostitutes.  He would remove their insides, mainly destroying the uterus, after he killed them.  As the murders continued, his violence to the mutilated victims grew worse and worse.  However, he was never apprehended and so his deeds survived into legend.

From that legend, many stories and fanciful tales along with copycats and pop culture survived.  From Hell is based off of a comic book written in the shadow of the legend of Jack the Ripper.  Johnny Depp plays the Inspector while Heather Graham plays the part of Mary Kelly.  Both are based off of the true actions and deeds of their historical characters.  Needless to say, the story has some Hollywood flair of romance and it nearly seethes with similarities between this movie and the Sleepy Hollow tale made movie that Depp also played a main role.

This is not for a history buff if s/he is unaware that the movie is based off of a pop culture version of the stories from London's streets.  It also isn't particularly well done in keeping the killer a secret.  Though there are suspicions about the killer being one of the characters, it becomes blindingly obvious near the middle of the movie.

Regardless, the movie IS an interesting one, mixing fact with fiction, and it certainly kills two hours of time for those who can stomach a bit of throat slashing fun.  Spending the money on Blu-Ray however?  Maybe not entirely recommended unless you are like me and have a certain affinity for Johnny Depp (or perhaps red heads like Heather Graham in this case).",1330214400,,2200,4.754617414248021

1440289,4,B00005JKJM,"For me, a good horror movie must present a great atmosphere.  From Hell does just that.  Set in Victorian London, it follows an inspector (Depp) as he investigates a series of grisly murders by an unknown villian called ""Jack the Ripper.""
Heather Graham co-stars as one of the prostitues being stalked by the Ripper.  Ian Holm co-stars as a royal doctor who assists Depp in his investigation.

The murders are done pretty well in the movie and surprisingly, the amount of gore and blood isn't all that bad.  You'll see the flash of a knife, or a quick camera flash of the corpse, but its not over the top at all.

Spoiler Alerts:

This movie did a good job of capturing the grimy and dark White Chapel neighborhood while contrasting it to the clean and well-lit upper-class areas.  Depp does a good job as the lead investigator, while Graham just does an okay job at being a lowerclass prostitute with obviously dyed red hair.  I did have a hard time buying the romance between Depp and Graham, and I found it amusing that Graham was always clean and looked pure compared to the other prostitutes.  You also never see her conducting the business of the trade; obviously to keep her ""above-board"" for Depp's character.

I liked the plot twist as to who Jack the Ripper is, though they could have done a better job explaining why these events happened.  Apparently in the graphic novel, the prostitutes learn early on who the mysterious lover really was (Prince Albert) and plan to extort the Crown, which is what set the chain of events in motion.  That would have been an interesting plot point to see.

Anyway, this is a fun movie and you'll enjoy it.  It looks great on Blu Ray",1320192000,,1679,4.568561872909699

1440291,4,B00005JKJM,"The graphic novel this movie was based on attempted to explain in it's own way, a theory as to what really happened in the Whitechapel District of East London as ""Jack The Ripper"" basically made up a lot of nonsense because there is no way it can be refuted.

The movie dilutes the facts even more but the movie has wonderful sets and atmosphere that make you forget it's obvious flaws.  Johnny Depp and Heather Graham (both Americans) try their best to pull off the cockney accent and having lived in Aldgate, East London which is just short of the sound of the ""Cockney Bells"", I know something of the area.  However, it wasn't in 1888, it was 1971!!!!!!

The names of the characters are accurate, and that's about it.  There is no more truth to the story.  Still, to watch the movie as entertainment and not to be a Jack The Ripper 101 course, the movie delivers plenty.

There are many scenes where women are physically abused and this may offend some.  The violence can be graphic and so be careful if these things upset you.",1312329600,,1030,4.470588235294118
1440292,3,B00005JKJM,"When you have a film by the name of `From Hell' that revolves around one of the most notorious and legendary serial killers of all time you kind of expect the terror to mount in unprecedented levels.  You salivate at the very idea of the film achieving and even surpassing all expectations as it devours you with that uneasy feeling of imminent repulsion and sheer dread.

Despite fantastically realized production design and sharply implemented edits; `From Hell' loses most of its staying power thanks to a strange lack of fear.

The film attacks the story of Jack the Ripper from the vantage point of a Scotland Yard sleuth by the name of Frederick Abberline.  Abberline has opium influenced visions of the slayings perpetrated by the Ripper, and so he uses these visions to further his investigation, picking away at the mystery behind the blood.  Along the way he is aided by a street walker (bet they weren't referred to as those in that day) and derailed by nearly everyone else.  Uncovering the truth behind the murders is apparently a dangerous journey; one that certain members of society would work their fingers to the bone to make sure went unfulfilled.

When the opium induced fog has lifted, it becomes sadly apparent that `From Hell' is not all that it could have been.  For a film of such salacious subject, it is surprisingly mild.  Despite the influx of prostitutes there is barely a scene of sexuality, and the murders themselves are faintly hinted at or contain minor moments of shock gore that is forgettable and underwhelming.  This could have been forgiven had the films core been devoted to a more fleshed out and detailed depiction of the `inner monster' dealing these dastardly deeds, but instead the revelatory climax is weakened by a mere surface attempt at identifying a monster.  Sure, the film offers it's `viewpoint', but it under-works it.

The film wants to be a horror film but it lacks the horror.

Johnny Depp delivers the same performance he gives in all his other movies, and he does a decent enough job to escape my usual dismembering of his talent (the man just needs to go away).  Heather Graham tries her hardest here, but the script is so unkind to her (she could have handled a deeper character, don't you think) and it made her a forgettable clich&eacute;.  I love Ian Holm, and he definitely steals a lot of the audience's attention, but I feel that it isn't always in a good way.

The uneven nature of the script (which really should have been reworked a few dozen times before production) does no justice to a tale that should be brandished upon the minds of all.  There are a few attempts to capitalize off of this particular tale; and this is probably the least successful.",1300320000,,2725,4.7272727272727275

1440295,4,B00005JKJM,"I probably should do the research, but quite likely won't, but I wonder just how many movies have been made of the infamous Jack The Ripper Case over the years; never mind what are probably hundreds of books.

Well, this is yet another take of the old Ripper tale.  And this version had a few things going for it.  First, it starred Johnny Depp whose acting ability never ceases to amaze me.  I have thoroughly enjoyed him in every part I have seen him in and this movie was not exception.  The movie also featured Ian Holm, no mean actor himself.  The supporting cast was pretty decent and played their parts well.  Secondly, Victorian London was portrayed pretty well, although from all accounts I have read, it was much dirtier than that which was shown in this film.  Third, it did have a few new twists which separated it from others.  They threw the Masonic order in and did a pretty good job of portraying the anti-Semitism which always hung over most European cities at that time.  The story line was plausible if you stretch your imagination a bit.

The movie had a few things going against it, as far as I was concerned.  First, it was quite long and drawn out.  This was okay as I watched it at home and was able to take a few breaks.  I would have hated to have sat though this one in a theater.  Secondly, they had some of the most God awful background music I have ever heard.  It almost drove me crazy.  Third, it probably went over the top just a bit with the gratuitous violence.  Now I realize that due to the subject matter; hey, we are talking Jack the Ripper here, that violence was to be expected and was certainly a central theme in this story.  There were just a few too many body parts being shuffled here and there to make it realistic.

Was I entertained?  Yes I was.  It just boiled down to the fact that I have been more entertained by other movies in this particular genre, or dealing with this time period.  Give me ""Room with a View,"" or one of the recent renditions of ""Emma"" any old day.

Would I watch this movie again?  No, once was quite enough...thank you very much.

Would I recommend this one to others?  Yes, especially for fans of Johnny Depp or Jack the Ripper enthusiasts.

1440368,4,B00005JKJM,"Usually I am pretty critical of a movie depicting historical events when it tries to twist things and, in ways, change the view of history or give biased views, etc. As I believed there was ""nothing on tv"" as we all say, I just left my tv on as I started in on my Sodoku book. However, within minutes the book was down and I was following the movie. In conflict of my normal views on historically-based movies changing facts, I actually enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Someone obviously knew enough of not only the story of Jack the Ripper, but of the surroundings at the time. Weaving in the royal family, Scotland yard, thugs running amock, true events, and the secret society of the Free Masons, this turned out to be a very enjoyable movie. Historically knowing that The Ripper was never found or uncovered, I expected the ending to be the same but honestly was pleasantly surprised to see the ending in this movie. I am not much of a horror/mystery movie fan but this one is good enough that I plan on purchasing it now.",1248393600,,1024,4.481283422459893

1440370,4,B00005JKJM,"Please note: I'm here reviewing the two-disc ""Director's Limited Edition.""

It's hard to believe this movie's almost ten years old; seems like yesterday it was released, but it was filmed in 2001.  Other than the fact that it co-stars Heather Graham (who hasn't co-headlined a major motion picture in quite some time), there's very little about this film which seems dated.  In fact it's probably improved with age.  Staying close to the template of ""Se7en,"" producers-directors the Hughes Brothers adapt Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel with aplomb, bringing the late 19th Century to life in all its opium-den decadence.

I'm sure a lot of viewers have issues with how this movie strays from the source material, but I prefer to look at it as a wholly separate entity.  And it works well.  In Moore's version the reader quickly knows who Jack the Ripper is, but the Hughes Brothers make this more of a traditional mystery.  The viewer can, however, pretty easily figure out who the murderer is.  You can expect that this film will be violent - any movie about Jack the Ripper would have to be - but it reminded me more of ""Chinatown"" than anything else.  The web of intrigue, period details, and twisted conspiracies are all very well panned out and executed, making this much more than the grisly hackwork it could've become.

Acting is good throughout - Johnny Depp is fantastic as usual in his role, as is Heather Graham, though I have to wonder why the producers couldn't at least have gotten an English actress for the role.  The actor playing Jack the Ripper is as malevolent as you could want, and I love the detail of his expanded irises when he's in ""Ripper"" mode, as if he's a demon in human guise.  The Hughes' directing is also stylish and confident - lots of tracking shots and well-done establishing shots which pull you into the sordid world of 1880s London.  I also appreciate how they filmed the gruesome murder scenes, leaving much to the viewer's imagination.  Again, this could've easily become some cheap gorefest, but the Hughes have made it a bit more highbrow, going for a macabre approach that works perfectly for the material.  The things the Ripper did to his victims were unthinkable, and certainly unfilmable - certainly things I'd never want to see in a film, at least.

But let's talk about the drugs.  I'm all about the mystique of those Victorian-era opium dens, with the velvet walls and plush rugs and languorous addicts puffing away in contentment.  Depp's character is an opium addict, so we get a few scenes in Chinese-operated dens, and the Hughes brothers bring these places fully to life.  And since Depp's character solves his cases via opium-induced trances, we get a neat tripping scene, complete with worshipful close-ups of an opium pipe being prepared, fired up, and toked.  But the later absinthe scene goes even further, and glorifies drug use moreso than any other  scene in recent film.  Depp prepares a glass of absinthe in the classic ""Prague ritual"" method, with laudanum-dosed sugar cube  placed over a slotted spoon, doused with fire, and then plunged into the drink itself.  This scene about made me want to rush out and buy an overpriced bottle of absinthe.  In fact, I'm still considering it.

I'd say this movie is a good purchase, as it is one you could watch at least a few times.  The first viewing you're moreso occupied keeping up with who's who, figuring out who the Ripper is, and piecing together the strands of conspiracy.  And it is an enjoyable movie, despite the subject matter and the numerous prostitute-butcherings.  It even has a somewhat ""happy"" ending that doesn't seem tacked on just to appease the Middle American market.

As for the DVD release, the movie is on disc 1 and looks and sounds great.  Disc 1 also features a plethora of deleted scenes, none of which are more than two minutes long.  There are about twenty of them, and they're basically little pieces that either set up scenes or provide more resolution for others.  None of them stand out, and none of them were integral to the movie.  That being said, since none of them are that pertinent, they could've easily been integrated back into the film, which would've truly given us the ""Director's"" edition promised on the cover.  The only incongruous scene is the one that couldn't be integrated back into the film - an alternate ending which is the same as the one in the film itself, only taking place in a different location and a different time.  It's filmed in a gorgeous Shanghai opium den (complete with a gorgeous and nude Chinese woman, about whose rear Hughes expounds upon at length in the optional commentary) and has some of the best shots in the film, but was understandably dropped in favor of the ""real"" ending.

Disc 2 features several making-of documentaries, including one about the Moore/Campbell graphic novel, a ""tour of the murder sites"" (which is a tour of the film's set rather than the actual murder locations in London), a ""first look"" documentary hosted by Heather Graham (which features the most annoying camera pans and zooms this side of MTV), and an insider's view into absinthe (which was still illegal when this film was made, but is now legal pretty much everywhere...even here in the US!  Yep, I'm gonna buy that bottle after all.).",1243814400,3,5325,4.790799561883899

1440373,4,B00005JKJM,"Having watched this 2001 DVD again the other night, and again reading through several of the myriad published histories of The Ripper crimes of 1888 Victorian London, I thought I'd add one MORE perspective on this variably-received movie, now 8 years past its initial release. As a brief background, I (like so many others) have always been fascinated by the crime story, have read a lot (by no means all) of the critical histories (some good, ie: Philip Sugden's materpiece....some acknowledged to be bogus, though entertaining, ie: ""The Diary of Jack the Ripper""), and have seen several of the movie adaptations, of which ""From Hell"" is the most recent, and arguably the most entertaining (my other choice being the 1988 TV miniseries with Michael Caine, which for some reason is STILL not available for USA DVD's).

After reading a number of the reviews on this site (which are not unexpectedly quite varied, from one to five stars), I thought I'd offer that what you see/like/enjoy/appreciate in ""From Hell"" is likely mostly what you wanted to see before viewing it- not unlike the Ripper case itself, which still draws a multitude of opinions now 120 years after the fact.

First, for those reviewers who didn't find the storyline of ""From Hell"" believable: The published critical histories of the Ripper crimes, including the most critically acclaimed work by Sugden, all at least mention the possibility of the Crown Prince/William Gull/government conspiracy theory, as in the movie- including even the Annie Crook/Crown Prince secret marriage. While not generally considered by most serious historians to be the ""answer"" to the Ripper crimes(Sugden especially provides rather convincing evidence that it is sheer folly), its worth remembering that the real Ripper never was caught, or even close to being conclusively identified (not yet, anyway), so the movie is entitled to its own take, and shouldn't be overly criticized for that alone. It is also rather instructive that the more likely suspects (Montague Druitt, George Chapman, for just two examples) to have been The Ripper (Abberline, in fact, suspected Chapman) wouldn't necessarily make for as entertaining a movie, compared to the always fetching idea that a high government conspiracy is involved. So remember, ""From Hell"" is not a documentary (it IS based on a graphic novel, after all), nor does it intend to be a critical assessment of the published histories and police facts: it's just meant to be entertaining- and at that, I'd argue it succeeds well enough.

Lots of criticisms of Heather Graham's choice for the role of the Ripper's final (well, maybe) victim, Mary Kelley, as well as her acting performance in the film. Many criticized how beautiful she is in the film, which is out-of-sorts for an East End London prostitute in 1888. True, but it is also worth noting that all of the histories also point out that of the 5 murdered prostitutes commonly attributed to The Ripper, that Kelley was singularly attractive, including the hair. So the movie chooses to embellish her beauty: so what? For me, since I knew I wasn't watching a documentary, that bit didn't ruin the movie for me- I recognized it for what it was: just another plot device to make the movie ""more viewable"" for most people (though clearly not all). As far as Graham's acting, and so-so accent: again, not deal-breakers for me. It does help to be able to understand the dialogue in a movie, after all- if the cockney accents and slang were taken to the historically accurate extreme, the dialogue might well be nearly unintelligible. So get over it, and enjoy the movie for what it intends to be: entertaining.

Comments about the violence portrayed in ""From Hell"" seem to also run the gamut from ""gratuitous"" to ""you got off easy"" (ie: not enough). Read the actual police accounts of the crimes (and the one memorable still photo of Mary Kelley's mutilated corpse at the scene of the crime), and you'll have to agree that the movie was very circumspect and reserved as far as depictions of the actual violence goes. Any movie about The Ripper has to include some images that convey the extreme violence of the crimes, which most investigators concluded increasingly suggested a murderer rapidly losing his sanity altogether. Indeed, one prevailing opinion at the time for why the crimes abruptly stopped after Kelley's murder was that the Ripper's mind had snapped completely, and that he likely committed suicide (the Druitt hypothesis, especially). For me, this movie did a good job of conveying the horror of the crimes, without bathing the viewer in gratuitous violence: but, to each his own, I suppose.

I thought the acting performances overall were quite good, though not exactly classics in moviemaking. And again, the real Abberline was neither psychic nor an opium addict, nor was he romantically involved with Kelley- anyone who knows even a little about the history ought to recognize all that as just movie-making- whether you like it or not, it's there to make the story more interesting for some. Personally, I didn't think it added much to the entertainment value of the movie- I'd rather have seen more time devoted to the real Abberline's sleuthing in this case.

A lot of comments about the music in ""From Hell""- many found it annoying largely because of it's persistence in every scene. I generally pay quite a bit of attention to musical scores in movies, and some of my favorite flicks typically are marked by their memorable scores. In no way would I call the score in ""From Hell"" memorable, but neither did I find it  annoying, as did so many others. To me, it was another non-factor in my enjoyment of this film.

I thought the sets (with modern day Prague simming nicely for Victorian London) were effective at creating an everpresent sense of doom and dread- my wife of 30 years came out of the theatre when we first saw this in 2001 saying that she ""never wanted to watch that movie again"", mainly because the atmosphere was so evil and foreboding that it made her very uneasy throughout. I call that good movie-making, when it affects someone so much.

When I ask myself why I only give this movie 4 stars (3 1/2, actually), it's because I was wanting something that stuck a little closer to the known facts- not about who the Ripper might have been, mind you (since that's still fair game to this day), but about the principals involved, especially Abberline's character, and perhaps the prostitutes individually. Perhaps I was also wanting a few more of the possible suspects run by me during the film, just to keep me guessing (as was done in the 1988 TV miniseries).

But these are just my hopes/biases before watching ""From Hell"", and not valid criticisms of the movie as it is offered. When considered that way, it largely succeeds, and is worth viewing.",1232928000,3,6841,4.9100346020761245
1440374,2,B00005JKJM,"From Hell starring Johnny Depp is set against the backdrop of the famed killer, Jack the Ripper. Depp is a great actor but even his unique talent can't save this boring, slow-moving train wreck. Who cast Heather Graham?! She is one of the worst female actors ever!! She can't even pull off any kind of accent, her performance is painful to watch. This film tries to be scary and grounbreaking but I lost interest halfway through, snooze...",1224547200,,439,4.714285714285714
1440375,4,B00005JKJM,"""From Hell"", the 2005 Jack the Ripper opus from the Hughes Brothers, almost makes the grade as the definitive movie about Victorian England's elusive killer.  It's certainly atmospheric enough, with fog-shrouded alleyways and convincingly evocative street scenes brought vividly to life by cinematographer, Peter Deming.

Most of the performances are first-rate, too, with Johnny Depp a standout as Inspector Frederick Abberline, a real-life detective who, for purposes of the film, is gifted with psychic talents and cursed with a drug problem.  Bedraggled and debauched, Depp drags Abberline through the grim proceedings with intelligence and compassion; he's empathetic with the Whitechapel crowd, but wary, as well.  He looks on the ill-fated prostitutes as fellow human beings fallen on hard times, but their men are something else, entirely.  Vicious, cunning, and altogether amoral, any number of these men rivaled the infamous serial killer in terms of misogyny and violence against women.  Robbie Coltrane is also fine as Abberline's nursemaid/assistant.  Tough and blunt, Coltrane heaves his hulking bulk after the addled Depp, trailing him from murder scene to opium den with the weary acceptance of a loyal manservant; it is Coltrane who gives the movie its true heart.  Ian Holm, as Sir William Gull, physician to the Queen, also gives a finely shaded, elegant performance as a medical man practicing long past his point of retirement.  More problematic, I think, is Heather Graham, a uniquely modern, American actress who, here, attempts to assay the role of a 19th Century London prostitute, and none too successfully.  I like Graham alright, but she's just not a fit with this film.  Her accent isn't convincing, and she just doesn't have the acting chops to carry off the important role of Mary Jane Kelley.  The American actress, Susan Clark, fared better as Mary Kelley in the 1979 film, ""Murder By Decree"", and I think therein lies a big part of the problem that I have with ""From Hell"".  Not Heather Graham's performance, but comparisons with the earlier film.

""Murder By Decree"" featured famed fictional sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, frantically chasing around London in an attempt to find, and put a stop to Jack the Ripper's madness.  In this film, Christopher Plummer and James Mason excelled in the roles of the dynamic Holmes and Watson, with Genevieve Bujold, David Hemmings, Donald Sutherland, Sir John Gielgud, and Anthony Quayle rounding out the big-name cast.  While not perfect, ""Murder By Decree"" seems to me to be a more cohesive film, and covers much of the same territory that is retread in ""From Hell"".  In fact, except for the detectives, ""From Hell"" could have been, essentially, a remake.

The same could also be said with regards to the 1988 miniseries, which is perhaps, to date, the definitive Jack the Ripper story.  In it, Michael Caine convincingly portrayed an older, wiser Abberline (minus the ESP and drug problem), Armand Assante played a suspect, Jane Seymour and Susan George were among the menaced women, and Ray McAnally was cast as Sir William Gull.  The miniseries played out over several nights, giving it  time to present a more detailed mystery, and to delve more deeply into the characters of those involved.  ""From Hell"" also seems to borrow liberally from this miniseries, thereby giving it a less-than-fresh feel(although the in-your-face gore is something missing from either of these earlier treatments).

While ""From Hell"" suffers from comparisons to earlier films, it is still stylish and exciting, with (mostly) good performances, so it should satisfy fans of period thrillers.",1222214400,,3672,5.228668941979522
1440376,4,B00005JKJM,"Jack the Ripper was the first known serial killer, a modern murderer in a Victorian world.  In From Hell, the Hughes brothers bring to life the Victorian city and the modern monster that haunted it.  From Hell, like all Ripper lore, is based in fact but filled out by fantasy.  The characters, the Victorian London, the events that unfold are all an odd combination of popular imagination and history.  But in this case the combination works, and neither element overwhelms the other.  The movie is darkly frightening and believable in the willing-suspension-of-disbelief way.

Johnny Depp plays Inspector Abberline in a deft, understated performance that fits the setting and skillfully avoids the cliche Scotland Yard caricature.  Heather Graham (not my favorite actress) is remarkable sympathetic and realistic in a performance that bends over backwards to avoid being ""the hooker with the heart of gold"" and usually succeeds.

The gore is present but not gratuitous, considering the subject matter.  But to anyone with a weak stomach, there was a reason they called him The Ripper.  The mystery unravels deliberately, skillfully making use of all the early embedded clues so that you can almost guess who the Ripper is... perhaps.  From Hell gives Jack the Ripper's legend its due; it succeeds in melding the modern and Victorian, the true horror and the myth that Jack the Ripper has become seamlessly.",1221696000,,1407,5.154185022026431

I couldn't believe how excellent this movie was, with the twists and turns I should have guessed who the ripper was, and felt pretty embarressed when I couldn't figure it out until the end.

Most of the time my mouth was wide open, because of the intensity I got from the lewdness of it all. What did I expect though it was a movie about a serial killer? All the women in the film, really set the profile for a group of prostitutes or ""unfortunates"". I'm very glad I didn't live on the east end of Britain in the 1880's. I always believed that men killed or raped woman, in order to feel more powerful. I thought that since we have had so many more killings now that it was possibly because American woman have gained more rights, and this has caused men to lose the superiority mind-set they once had so many years ago. Now from watching this movie, and reading more history on the actual Jack the ripper killer or killers, I have come to the conclusion that maybe there is more motive to the brutally savage-minded killers than just that.

The high concepts and rock and roll video treatments can be forgiven if for no other reason than to savor the ghastly atmosphere and psycho-sexual elements that were (and currently still can be in a major release) used to convey some sort of realistic horror.

Despite some reviewers quibbling about historic details this version goes way beyond the norm to present characters and sets very much like their historical inspirations. So what if all the prostitutes didn't actually know each other (though some of them knew of each other) their names, their sequence of murders, the places and buildings, even the wounds were all quite accurate. The suggestion that Martha Tabram was not a Ripper victim is accurate. The reproduction of Mary Kelly's corpse is (though aligned in the wrong direction) a classic image that most shlock producers would not have bothered to strive for.

1440445,5,B00005JKJM,"Based on the Alan Moore graphic novel of the same name (which from what I understand was loosely based on a book by Stephen Knight that layed out the Jack the Ripper/Monarchy/Masonic theory in From Hell) this is the best movie I have seen in a long time. Moore is a serious occultist. Even his wikipedia entry says he practices magic and worships a Roman snake diety. He's also very educated on conspiracy related matter so its no wonder that he wrote something like this. Depp does a great job in From Hell. In my opinion he should be acknowledged as one of, if not the, best actors going these days. I was really surprised at how much conspiracy related material made it into a mainstream movie like this. Also how much about Freemasonry got out. Even a reeactment of one of their ""secret"" initiation vows and rituals. But in typical Hollywood fashion they also snuck in a few references where the people on the Police force who knew what was really going on talked about blaming the Jews and using them as scapegoats.

I admit that I haven't done a huge amount of research on the Jack the Ripper murders but from what I know it appears to me that there was a Masonic coverup, and there is a lot that points in the direction that they were Masonic ritual murders. As far as the murders being hits ordered by the Queen of England and carried out by Masonic henchman in order to kill off everybody that had had knowledge of a baby allegedly Fathered by the Prince and given birth to by a prostitute I know nothing about any of that although it is pretty much par for the course for the historicly documented pattern of psychopathic behavior of the British monarchy. I'd like to get a hold of copy of Knights book and delve into that theory though. From Hell does show how I believe these super elites use the semi-elites as henchman and discard and eliminate them when the mission is accomplished.

1440448,5,B00005JKJM,"The Jack the Ripper murders in nineteenth century London has remained an intriguing unsolved mystery with many plausible theories behind the identity of the Ripper. Based on this background, From Hell posits the theory that the Ripper was actually a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Victor Albert who married & sired a child with a commoner, worse still a prostitute, and the movie revolves around the cover-up by members of the British upper class.

The murdered prostitutes never knew eachother, and the royal conspiracy theory is laughable at best. For a good weekend entertainment movie this film will certainly fulfill that need.

The film is beautifully shot and the atmosphere of the grimy southside of London is captured incredibly well. The murder scenes are very graphic and this is definitely not for the squeemish or the very young. Depp plays a role similar to the one he played in Sleepy Hollow but this is a much more serious movie aimed at a different audience. My kids loved Sleepy Hollow but I wouldn't let them watch this. It would give them nightmares for a week.

The plot is interesting and while fictional it has enough plausibilty to engage the viewer for it's entire length.

Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.

Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.

1440475,4,B00005JKJM,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of ""Jack the Ripper"" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine outstanding in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation into a mystery that we will never know all the answers to.

While I respect this version with Johnny Depp in the role as a great horror flick, it is not nearly as historical as Caine's. (History is to some extent sacrificed for Horror and to some extent Romance.) Some of you may know the Ripper's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly) Well, they have a close friendship, and we get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, they knew each other, but they were just associates.)

Well, of course, Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting steak and pouring a dark red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline.) it is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Depp makes him look morose and like he is going to die any day. (Perhaps Depp did not want to just imitate Michael Caine.)

One thing I have some trouble with is that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, we could understand Caine's superiors views to some extent. here, it is obvious that Depp's superiors are getting frustrated with him while they are obviously keeping things from him. At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side.

You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out quicker than Caine did. (Caine had 4 hours. Depp only has 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with the eventual 5th victim Mary Jane Kelly. Depp of course discovers things that eventually start completeing a puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and friendly to the killer (obviously without knowing he is talking to the killer).

One slight problem I have is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and even offered helpful advice. In this version, it seems strange that the killer is friendly to Depp and offers help. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same split personality here that he did in the Caine version.)

I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, an Depp did a great job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's Sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the probable historical accuracy. On the other hand, this version is geared more towards horror. (So if that is what you want, you won't be disappointed.)

I don't think I can give a very good review of this movie because it is based on actual events, and the case was never solved, and I'm not familiar with the facts that do exist about it.

All I can say is that given what I know, which is extremely limited, I think this is a good portrayal of what may have been.  Of course, I think Johnny Depp was awesome in his role of the inspector in charge of the case.  But then again, I love him; so...

I'm not normally a fan of movies that take us back so far in time, but this one didn't bother me.  I guess that is probably because of the subject matter.  It's one of those instances where plot overrules setting/time period.  That doesn't happen very often for me, so I'm impressed with that alone.

We know when the ride will dip and turn and we brace ourselves accordingly. Starring Johnny Depp as a psychic, opium-addicted cop with a lower-class accent, FROM HELL has more red herrings than a fish market. Soon the answer to this murder mystery makes itself clear-just look past the red herrings and you'll see the real killer.

Rather than kicking back and enjoying the familiar ride, I found my mind wandering aimlessly. I contemplated the current state of a film version of Caleb Carr's The Alienist, a novel about a serial killer in New York City during the Industrial Revolution. Additionally, I wondered if I could track down a video copy of the old ""In Search Of"" episode that dealt with Jack The Ripper. Both the Carr novel and Nimoy-hosted documentary seemed like they'd be far superior to the droll thriller I was trying to watch.

Shot in lovely colour and peppered with the all-too-familiar ""serial killer/psychic"" grainy, over-saturated clips (think SE7EN or NATURAL BORN KILLERS), the only high point of the film is Depp's Detective assistant played by Robbie Coltrane whose literate dialogue puzzles the Cockney cops he commands.

1440502,4,B00005JKJM,"The diversely talented Johnny Depp stars in this Hughes Brothers fictionalization of the story of Jack the Ripper, the prostitute-killing serial murderer of Victorian England. Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline, who in real life, was an experienced, thoughtful bulldog of a cop who remained haunted by his inability to solve the Ripper case for the rest of his life.

Depp's Abberline is a laudanum-dosing, absinthe-drinking, opium-smoking psychic detective who uses his drug-enhanced visions to solve crimes. He is brought onto the case after the Ripper brutally murders one of the ""circle of friends,"" a group of prostitutes plying their trade in London's Whitechapel area in 1888.

The circle of friends, led by Mary Kelly (the irresistible Heather Graham) are privy to a major State secret and are being victimized one after another. Depp tries valiantly to protect Mary Kelly and her friends, though the lures of their lifestyle eventually draw them out back onto the streets to be slaughtered. The real-life Mary Kelly (whom Graham somewhat resembles) was the youngest, prettiest and most vivacious of the Ripper's victims. She was also the worst mutilated, and hence the most kindly treated in the contemporary press.

The Hugheses use a variant of the Royal Conspiracy theory to build their story, though historically it is probably untrue that any member of the British Royal House was involved in the Ripper killings, just as the Ripper's victims were most likely not known to each other.

FROM HELL (the address line in one of the Ripper's letters) is intensely atmospheric. The sets and cinematography are outstanding. FROM HELL has a powerfully engaging storyline. FROM HELL does as well as any color film could do in setting the mood and tone of Victorian London. Where the story has not been changed for the sake of the plot, FROM HELL is accurate. It is instructive that THE ELEPHANT MAN, which takes place in the same setting in the same year was filmed in black and white. (As a matter of fact, the Elephant Man, John Merrick, makes an appearance in FROM HELL, though no kindly Dr. Treves is in evidence.)

Jack the Ripper is identified, a fictionalization which does dilute the story. By identifying the Ripper, the Hughes brothers give some measure of rationality and motive to a person who so clearly had none.

The DVD's Special Features are very thin, and consist mostly of incredibly boring deleted scenes along with some very dull commentary by the Hughes Brothers.

While the Hugheses generally downplay the sordid aspects of the lives of the Whitechapel prostitutes, and leave much of the gore of the Ripper killings to symbol-laden flashbacks and imagination, they communicate these elements well, nonetheless. However, a colorized version of the actual death scene photograph of the real Mary Kelly is used in a momentary flashback, and it is one of the most hideous images ever to make it into any film. That one human being could butcher another in such a way---so personally---is paralyzing to consider. Jack the Ripper deserves his reputation.",1138060800,2,3082,5.07905138339921

1440504,3,B00005JKJM,"From Hell explores a theory about the identity of the infamous 19th-century serial killer Jack the Ripper.  Facts about the over a hundred year-old actual crime have unfortunately been lost. Many different theories exist as to who Jack the Ripper was.  From Hell explores a newer theory that came about in the 1970's, when old documents were discovered.  It is the ""Royal Conspiracy Theory.""  The idea is that Prince Albert had an illegitimate child with a London street prostitute, whom he secretly married.  When the royal house found out, measures were taken to silence her and her whore friends, who were witnesses at the church wedding.  This theory also involves the Stonemasons.

Johnny Depp is the best actor in the film.  He plays the opium-addicted - but brilliant - Scotland Yard inspector Adeline.  His co-star Heather Graham falls flat as the whore-target ofthe Ripper.  For starters, her red hair looks so artificial and anachronistic.

The filmography, sets, and music are chilling.  Jack the Ripper's carriage, with his goblin-fire green lantern and black horses looks like a coach from Hades.

The ending, and the actual revelation of J.T.R. I found more funny than scary.  There were too many close-ups of his face.  He was more scary as a faceless figure in a top hat and cloak.

1440506,3,B00005JKJM,"There are more books about Jack The Ripper in print today than of all the US presidents combined.  No really.  What is it about this story that draws us in?  Evil?  Mystery?  The seemy side of life?  Conspiracy theories?  Maybe.  So many things seem so clear now, while so many things will never be solved today.

This movie was just ok, I share no illusions about it being otherwise.  What I would recommend you do is watch the special features with the Jack The Ripper documentary first, then the movie.  The story is rather choppy and tends to bore, plus the people the actors portray are softened up quite a bit to the point where you might actually like them when in real life they probably were not so likable.

In the roughneck White Cross district in London during the Victorian age, a few prostitutes are murdered.  Nothing to bat an eye at, as most women involved in prosititution will most likely be the victims of violent crime at some point.  What is odd, as the theories would later project, that all of these women in this particular neighborhood knew each other.  They knew each other fairly well, two were even roommates at one point or another, and they all operated out of the same stretch of street when they picked up their johns.  The theory is that they were being targeted, if you believe the most popular of popular theories, as they were being silenced.  These women were blackmailing the royal family as they were witness to the marriage of one of Queen Victoria's sons to a common woman (formerly of their profession), in a Catholic ceremony, and birth of a potential threat to the royal liniage.

The movie, curiously enough, skirts around the fact that all the women, both of the prostitute circle and the mother of baby Alice (the child in question), did not know that the wealthy man she was being kept by was a prince.  They were portrayed moreso as victims, there was never a hint that they were attempting to gain from this knowledge.  The last of the prostitutes in real life was the one most brutally murdered, but in the movie goes off to care for baby Alice in a secluded location far away.  Alice lived a long life and died in the 1950s.  But no one ever seemed to indicated if she was privy to this information or if she lived her life blissfully unaware.  There were too many things they turned into Disney aspects and too many things they left unresolved.",1129075200,,2398,4.525581395348837
1440507,2,B00005JKJM,"The Hughes Brothers, the directorial team responsible for the excellent ""Menace II Society"" have gone and stepped so far out of their league that the egg on their faces should be of the green, Dr. Seuss variety.  In making their interpretation of a `Jack the Ripper' period film, the directors, while crossing the Atlantic Ocean, seem to have crossed some line between the real and surreal as well .

The Ripper `hunting grounds' of 1888 through 1889 was the Whitechapel and Spitlefield area which suffered a poverty and filth that beggars the imagination, at least where these hapless filmmakers are concerned.  A decade after the Ripper crimes, Jack London went undercover in the East End to see for himself what it was like, and he related terrible stories of poverty and filth.  In the East End, he reported, an attempt at cleanliness was a ""howling farce,"" and when the rain fell it was ""more like grease than water.""

Without analyzing any other aspect of the film, From Hell fails on its verisimilitude as regards the conditions of the streets haunted by its demented killer.  The cobbles, far from appearing to have been the running sewers they were, look as though a diligent crew with scrub brushes and mops had just finished with them, or at least as though a street cleaning machine had just passed.

The characters, for the most part, suffer from the same overabundance of cleanliness.  London's ""Unfortunates"", as prostitutes were called, were forced by circumstance to wear all or their belongings and sleep in human warehouses.  Heather Graham could never have looked so clean.  In reality, Johnny Depp's character would have had ample reason for being apprehensive about bodily contact with the female lead.

A guiding principle taught all aspiring novelists is to `write what you know'.  In filmmaking, the same principle would seem to apply.  In constructing the sets of the 1993 ""Menace II Society"", the Hughes brothers were working within a milieu they knew.  When they tried to project themselves across an ocean and back a century, they seem to have disassociated themselves from some basic realities of inner city environment.  The Watts, L.A. environment they knew well enjoys a level of prosperity and cleanliness an order of magnitude above that of the London, East End of 1888.  Poverty is endemic to all the inner cities, but while dealing with a subject matter grounded in a much greater degree of poverty than that of their local neighborhoods, they have deleted the filth that polluted its lifeblood, thereby vitiating anything else they might have achieved.

The DVD has an interesting interview with the Hughes brothers but the film, in contrast to the pristine streets it is photographed on, is a dismal failure.",1128816000,2,2747,4.989035087719298

It had good reviews and was talking about an interesting topic. Therefore, I thought that it was going to be a very good movie. Wrong. The movie was interesting and captivating but had a lot of negatives. First of all, Johnny Depp's character was a major drug addict, which I found to be very strange and unnecessary. This degraded his character and made him out as a strange and weird guy.

Secondly, the movie wasn't a thriller. No, instead, it was a gorefest. Jack the Ripper is killing prostitutes so the directors are forced to show lots of blood. The movie is very dark and the ending is strange and cruddy. The movie is even too dark at times, such that you can't see anything.

The movie is also boring at times as well as even quite confusing at others.

Well, I guess that all that it has going for it is the acting but even the acting seems forced with the adopted accents by the prostitutes. Ian Holm and Johnny Depp are good and the score is also descent. When Jack the Ripper is shown, it's pretty neatly and cool made with the steps on his carriage, his top hat and his ""operating tools"".

So, as you can see, the movie isn't good and is very disspointing. It has few things going for it and the plot construction and gore are bad. Besides some good acting and neat reconstruction of ancient London, this movie is lousy and not worth a rent at all.",1123286400,,1485,4.350180505415162
1440510,3,B00005JKJM,"The Hughes brothers' From Hell is a movie about Jack The Ripper. And it isn't.  The movie's plot centers around the exploits and potential identity of Victorian England's mysterious knife-wielding prostitute killer, but its makers also try to shine a light on the darker aspects of that time and place, on the inevitable abuse of power, and on urban decay in general.  With a vicious murderer prowling the streets and leaving victims in pieces in his wake, there's a palpable sense of dread hanging over the proceedings, but even if Jack didn't make an appearance, there'd still be plenty to fear.  The 19th-century London of From Hell is a decidedly inhospitable place, racked by vice and crime, with plenty of unprincipled people willing to exploit the downtrodden for a buck (or, in this case, a pound).  In other words, it's sort of like any of dozens of urban ghettoes in 21-century America, except the appearances of those involved and the weapons of choice are different.

I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel on which this movie was based, but the film version at least bears some pretty strong thematic parallels with Moore's V for Vendetta.  While that comic classic examined the dark underbelly of a fictional post-Cold War fascist England, From Hell attempts to strip away Victorian England's veneer of respectability to reveal a society awash in decadence, corruption, and prejudice, where power is lodged in decidedly undemocratic institutions and super-secret plots abound.  Some have written at some length about the movie's historical accuracy (or lack thereof), but it's really beside the point.  From Hell is, simply put, a movie, not a documentary, and it entertains more than well enough with what it has.  Plausibility issues aside, it looks great, with plenty of atmosphere and high style, some way cool visuals, truly painful death scenes, and liberal sprinklings of gore, which is just enough to get you to forgive the movie's haphazard pacing and occasional lapses into slasher-movie formula (even I could see some of the deaths coming a mile away).  It's also got Johhny Depp sporting a nifty British accent as Fred Abberline, the tortured detective trying to fight through the corridors of power to collar the slasher while he also fights his own addictions and the visions of death and mutilation that come to torment him in his sleep; and a bug-eyed Ian Holm hamming it up as a royal doctor with some murky motivations and an obvious God complex.

So, in conclusion, you've got intrigue, nasty violence, some nice twists and turns in the plot as revelations start flying about halfway through, and another in a long line of excellent performances from Depp, not to mention a blindingly redheaded Heather Graham as perhaps the best-looking prostitute in all of London.

The Hughes brothers pulled off an impressive horror/suspense film with FROM HELL. At it's most basic level, the movie is a slasher movie. But FROM HELL is a slasher flick done with taste. The film is rather gruesome in certain sections and is fairly historically accurate. However, the brothers feared the possibility of a NC-17 rating if too much was revealed and used a great deal of restraint in re-creating the famous murders. It is a testament to their skills that they were able to re-produce the real-life terror felt at the time, but without displaying all the grizzly details.  Not only that but the historical re-creation of 1888 Whitechapel is amazing. Almost every minute detail is reconstructed to perfection.

Johnny Depp captures the essence of the real-life Abberline despite the fact that the real Abberline was short, balding, paunchy, and lived to a fairly ripe-old age.  Heather Graham does a decent job of portraying Mary Kelly, though it would have been nice to see a more real-looking actress in the role--Graham is just too Glamour Girlish.

There have been many Jack the Ripper movies made over the years, but FROM HELL is one of the better ones (despite the inprobable conclusion). The movie is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore and though their are several changes, the movie stays true to the spirit of the original text.

1440540,5,B00005JKJM,"Aside from taking a fresh and unique approach to the old mysteries of Jack The Ripper, From Hell delivers a gracefully languid storyline peppered with brutal killings and interesting musings into an old fashioned culture.

Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has a unique gift, a psychic ability to see murders in his opium dreams.  Because of this talent, he is assigned to the case of a brutally murdered prostitute along with his partner, Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane).  His suspicions turn away from the local gang of pimps and thugs, and towards a more educated and upper-class perpetrator as more and more girls are methodically butchered.

Abberline wins the confidence of one of the slightly more refined prostitutes, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), and uses her knowledge of the dead girls to uncover the unlikely murderer.

From Hell definitely has its faults, a sometimes weak script and a far-fetched assumption of the identity and background of Jack The Ripper, but makes up for those faults with its stunning visuals and moody atmosphere.

Using subtle photography rather than graphical violence in the murder scenes, it leaves a lingering taste in one's mouth that is nonetheless bloody and haunting.

Depp plays Abberline with brilliant panache, a man who still cares but is void of the usual emotional swamps most humans swim in, evident in the scene where the coroner is retching but Abberline coldly and methodically examines the mutilated corpse.  I love cold characters.  Heather Graham is a beautiful woman, but not a very good actress.  However, her character of Mary Kelly is probably the best performance she had done, in spite of the weak accent attempted.

There are also interesting notes to study while taking in the lush photography, the realism of the opium dens, the early lobotomies performed, a brief presentation of the Elephant Man, along with the cultural notions of the 1880's that well-bred and moneyed people simply could not be capable of such types of brutality.

The time frame is well done and interesting in that it also exposes the religious persecution of certain sects, not to mention total disregard for the prostitutes and those poor souls considered to be beneath the genteel societies notice or care.  One's birth class stands out far above their deeds, and propriety rules the day.  And ruling the propriety are a secret sect of Freemasons, answerable only to themselves and powerful enough to stop Abberline's investigation.

Perhaps because I am a very visual person I enjoyed the film more than many others did, but I encourage you to look beneath the slow, still waters of the movie's general flow, and pluck out the tasty treats in the form of interesting notes and speculations, and savor them for a bit.  It was really at that point that From Hell went from four to five stars for me.

Languid, graceful, gory, suspenseful, atmospheric, and moody, don't miss out on this great sleeper film.  Enjoy!",1102291200,10,2968,5.034764826175869
1440541,3,B00005JKJM,"I loved this movie, but there were four problems that made it difficult to love.

First, the character, Mary Kelly, is a whore who apparently never works.  You see her friends working, and even witness the transaction between a whore and her trick.  But Mary Kelly is clean and nice and somehow manages to make a living as a whore without having any customers.  I mean, I understand that one of the main characters can't be depicted as this disgusting, filthy, diseased whore, because no one would want to identify with her (whether they actually did or not is another story), but the way they sanitized it was ridiculous.

Second, the ending was just plain stupid.  They set it up so that this poor little French whore is killed in Mary Kelly's place (I don't care if I ruined it for you), and that Mary Kelly escapes back to Ireland where she raises a little orphaned girl.  This made me so angry I couldn't stand it.  First of all, the little French whore was just as sweet and nice as Mary Kelly was, but they make it look like it's somehow OK that the French whore was killed - it's NOT OK to kill off a whore just because she isn't your focus.  That in no way reduces the horror of the act itself.  (""Besides, there's no reason to kill [whores] - most of them are already dead inside."")  It was a stupid and endlessly irritating plot ""twist.""  I'll bet some Hollywood dim-wit forced them to tack that on.  No wonder the movie failed miserably at the box office.

Third, this took place in 1888, and then Mary escapes home to Ireland, where she raises her friend's little girl - you see her, looking like she's reached maybe six years old or so.  Well, guess what?  The Irish Potato Famine started in 1889, so Mary the Sanitary Whore, and baby Alice would have starved to death long before Alice got to be six years old.  Now, it makes sense to bet that Americans don't know their history, but still, it was schlocky and melodramatic and just plain pathetic.  I just couldn't deal with how stupid it was.

Fourth, there was a tacked-on love story.  I won't comment any further than to say that love stories or love-subplots ruin more movies than they save.

However (and I know how ridiculous this is going to sound after all the negative stuff I just said), other than these problems the movie was pretty good.  There are these seriously disturbing scenes in a mental hospital, and it's fun to watch Depp parade a whore around with him through an art gallery, offending all the ""respectable"" christian-types.  The dialogue is pretty decent as well.  I tend to shy away from movies set in this period - like Bram Stoker's Dracula - because modern writers can't seem to reproduce the dialect with any sort of accuracy.  I mean, this flick doesn't sound completely authentic, but it's really good relative to other movies set in this time, and there are even some decent jokes and wise @ss remarks (""I can suck the Thames dry"").  Also, the movie is beautiful to look at.  I don't know anything about the art of movie making, but whoever was responsible for the background scenes and camera work did an excellent job.

What's more is that the plot, aside from the tacked-on love story, is interesting.  It isn't exactly accurate insofar as the details of the case, but at least it's compelling and somewhat plausible (as opposed to the travesty of Mary Kelly's never turning a single trick).

So, if you can deal with the above mentioned problems, the DVD is worth your money.  Even though these things bothered me more than they might have bothered most people, I own the DVD, and like the movie very much.  I know that sounds hypocritical, but I don't care.  That's how I feel about it.

Insofar as the second disc, and the special features, I can't comment.  I don't really care about that stuff, and don't own a single DVD with special features that I've ever bothered to watch.",1100390400,2,3884,4.539568345323741

Heather Graham, could not become a reperesntation of virgin as the story would like to tell.

1440544,4,B00005JKJM,"OK, so this isn't the best movie I've seen in my life. I don't think it'll become a classic, because of its genre, but I think this movie is a lot better than some of the critics would have us believe.
Firstly, although I admit I wasn't hugely keen on all the cockney accents, I do think that Johnny Depp was brilliant. Maybe it's just because he's gorgeous, but I do think he was brilliant as the dark, brooding inspector in this film. He was just so cool, you couldn't help but find him a very likable hero. The dastardly villain, Jack The Ripper himself, was very powerful and convincing too - pretty much a flawless performance.
Although the plot was a tad long-winded and inexplicable at times, I've seen a lot worse and in the end, it did all make sense. I didn't get bored even when the movie was a little tough going, because of the superb set and generally interesting characters. I personally thought the prostitutes and policemen were extremely authentic - there was very little Hollywood glamour in the film, which was necessary to show the seedy areas of Victorian London.
My only real complaint about this movie would be Heather Graham - she really wasn't anything to write home about. Still, she wasn't playing a very demanding or charismatic role, so maybe I'm being a little harsh here. Otherwise, this film was a success in my opinion - well cast, well directed and brilliant scenery. By the way - this film is NOTHING like Sleepy Hollow. From Hell is pure evil, whilst Sleepy Hollow is its very tongue in cheek, poor relation.",1083456000,,1545,4.581227436823105
1440545,5,B00005JKJM,"Okay, I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp. I had also heard that Roman Polanski had a hand in the production somehow, though I don't know where I heard it and it's not in the credits. It was only in doing research on Roman Polanski, however, that I even heard about this movie -- and outside of my affinity for Johnny Depp, it would have been the only reason I purchased it.
Johnny Depp has done some very interesting occult related work lately, now that I think about it.
That said, yes, the movie is based on an intriguing theory about the Jack the Ripper murders. It is very powerful and well thought out. The cinematography is incredible, and appears to be a true labor of love.

1440546,5,B00005JKJM,"Jack the Ripper has always been a great mystery. No one will ever know who he was and what his motivations were, except if one day we come across new documents. This film is adapted from a comic strip and the theory is original, even if it is not in any way more objective than any other. The idea is that it is a freemason cleaning mission to protect the Prince of Wales who is syphilitic but has married a young prostitute and has had a child from her. The scandal has to be erased and the unacceptable heiress to the throne has to be pushed aside, destroyed, along with all the witnesses of the illegitimate marriage, what's more in a catholic church. The freemasons are moved into this extreme action by several reasons. First to avenge the crime from the catholic church, hence to clean up the plate of dirty linen they have had with the catholic church for centuries. Second, to clean up the social plate this time and get rid of prostitutes, at least some of them, and maybe frighten prospective customers. Prostitutes are seen as propagating diseases and social decay. Third, to strengthen the Crown of England, the Empire, because they have won a very important position in this political institution that more than tolerates them. They also agree with the vast program of this Empire : to civilize the world. Fourth, and this motivation is very obscure, they go back to old traditions and rituals that are supposed to symbolically save the world because they are inspired by God himself, thus projecting the free masons into a cosmological and religious mission : to be the new Abraham, the new Moses, the new messengers of God on earth to propagate his will and ethics. The inspector that tries to find out the truth is a mixture of many characters, particularly Sherlock Holmes, including the use of opium (though Holmes used cocaine), to have visions of the crimes and the criminal. This gives an esoteric dimension to the story. Of course this does not stop the criminal, though the film does pretend the criminal is punished after fulfilling his mission because he over-interpreted the objective of it. The film is well built, entertaining and even thrilling. And I particularly like the use of grapes in this plot. It reveals the deep poverty of many, the condescending pity and rejection of these dregs of society that prostitutes are, the aristocratic belief that these women can be lured by some valueless vain merchandise, etc. The free masons are shown as being a sect, nothing but a sect that tries to manipulate society through their penetrating into the inner circles of the governing body of it. Power is their main objective and they are ready to do anything to protect this power, their power or the power that tolerates them. They are in other words extremely dangerous. This is the modern dimension of this film and it is a disquieting one, because free masons still exist.

1440547,4,B00005JKJM,"Fascinating take on the Ripper legend.  The real star is the breathtaking direction/cinematography.  My favorite actor, Johnny Depp, is often lost behind the characterization and heavy Eastend accent.  The usually appealing Heather Graham looks so unreal in her castoff ""Ariel"" red wig and spouting a Eliza Doolittle'isms that she can't be credible.  Supporting cast, however, is first rate and the tension never lets up.
The DVD special features, particularly the commentary track, are a disappointment and do nothing to enhance the ""From Hell"" experience.

1440569,4,B00005JKJM,"Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is not your typical Scotland Yard inspector.  He has visions of crimes that he tries to suppress or embrace, depending on his mood, with drugs such as opium, laudanum and absinthe.  Luckily, he has Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to help keep him on task.  It is the sergeant who takes Inspector Abberline out to the scene of the first victim in the notorious Whitechapel district of 1888 London.  Most of the investigators believe that the slain prostitute is nothing to worry about and not unusual at all given her profession.  But Inspector Abberline notices some unusual things about the corpse, like the surgeon-like precision of the wounds and the expensive cluster of grapes near her hand.  How could a prostitute afford grapes and what kind of client would have hated her enough to do this?
As Inspector Abberline looks into the murder, he comes across Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who knew the victim and is convinced that the local boss is trying to scare them into paying what they owe.  But Abberline doesn't think it is that simple.  As he spends more time with Mary, he comes to discover that the first prostitute who disappeared left a daughter and that she was no longer working the streets, but had found a special man, an artist, who loved her and was taking care of her.  Mary convinces the inspector to find her and Abberline does, but she is in an insane asylum and seems to have the mind of a child.  Abberline turns to the noted ex-surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) to explain the procedure that made her so and to help give him insights on how a surgeon would have used the tools of his trade on the murdered prostitute.  The more Inspector Abberline delves into the seemingly unrelated stories, the more he is convinced that they are linked.  So when Abberline discovers that the artist lover is in fact the Prince, he suddenly comes to realize that the prostitutes who are being murdered all have one thing in common....
This was a very intriguing look at the Jack the Ripper tale with an interesting premise and solution to the seemingly unsolvable and random crimes.  The directors did a wonderful job at creating a very dark and creepy atmosphere on the film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat even when there is nothing scary going on.  I also liked their artful visions of the murders and their restraint in showing or not showing details and leaving it up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks.  Johnny Depp was superb in his role as Inspector Abberline, as he always is, and you found yourself cheering him on and wishing him every happiness, yet knowing that he wouldn't allow himself to be happy.  Heather Graham was quite convincing in her role as a poor British prostitute, but her accent was not quite right.  However, it is Ian Holm who really fools the viewers and keeps you in suspense as his character rapidly unravels at the end of the film.  However, with all of the film strengths I still had to give it 4 stars because it is just missing that certain something that makes a good film a great film.  The plot was a little hard to follow at times and I didn't care for some of the characters, but if you are at all interested in the famous Ripper crimes then this is a movie you shouldn't miss!",1078444800,,3324,4.58445945945946
1440570,5,B00005JKJM,"Sadly, a lot of reviewers have noted that there are many inaccuracies in the film concerning the factual details in the case of Jack the Ripper.  Certainly, the Ripper theory thats the premise of this film is quite controversial and is no doubt way off the mark.  But the Hughes Brothers did not intend to get the facts ""dead"" on, rather, they have created in my estimation one of the finest visual films ever made.  The London, circa 1888, that they have put on the screen is pure eye candy.  The sets are meticulous recreations of 1888 London, and the saturated colors create an ominous and foreboding pallette on which to tell the story.  The overall mood and look of the film reminds one at first of perhaps Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA or Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW, but this film's look is better and what might be expected if you were able to look into the mind of Edgar Allen Poe.
I have not mentioned the performances, but they were wonderful as well.  I just felt that all was eclipsed by the visual wonder of the film.  The DVD's picture and sound are pristine, as they are THX.  Watch this film not for ""surgical"" accuracy, but for sensory overload.

1440571,3,B00005JKJM,"It's a lot like the gothic horror of ""Sleepy Hollow"" in feel and tone -- dark. Neither film is perfect, but both are passable movies if you have a general taste for the genre.
Characterizations are cardboard as you may imagine. Whitechapel prostitutes were all apparently pretty, clear-skinned young women with hearts of gold. Fred Abberline was an opium addict who committed suicide after the Ripper murders (p.s. he wasn't, and he didn't -- he lived until 1929). Johnny Depp, fine actor though he is, was hilariously miscast in this film -- about 20 years too young to begin with.
Also, why do all American actors playing British characters feel they need to put on awful cockney accents? The real Abberline was born in Dorset and would likely not have the irksome ""ullo guvnor"" accent. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) was born in Ireland, raised in Wales and did not move to London until the age of 21.
Leaving aside the horde of factual errors, this was really a rather dull film. Far too long, overly melodramatic, and quite ridiculous in parts (the romance between Abberline and Mary Kelly, for example).
Interested in Jack the Ripper? Read Stephen Knight's speculative, but well-researched, ""Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution"". As for this movie, as I said above, a worthy rental if you are into the genre but not much else.",1077926400,4,1329,4.833333333333333
1440572,5,B00005JKJM,"After watching the first few minutes of this spellbinding film, I pushed away the meatlover's pizza.  Suddenly lost my appetite.  But that's quite all right:  FROM HELL's fascinating story--along with its mercurial cinematography--rapidly overwhelms and consumes all the muck and the gore of London's notorious Whitechapel district of the late 19th Century.
Yes, this is (yet) another film about Jack the Ripper, yet it presents the brutal murderer with a most bizarre twist, along with a plot suggesting a motive for the crimes as farfetched as an elephant swimming the Atlantic.  But the zany story works--a story about a small click of Whitechapel prostitutes harboring a secret and subsequently murdered, one by one--in part due to the ingenious visual devices employed by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, and in part due to the spine-tingling acting of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm.  Depp portrays Inspector Fred Abberline, a Scotland Yard detective who, aided by his dependency on opium, laudanum, and absinthe, has an uncanny ability to solve crimes.  Through his drug addiction, Abberline is ""chasing the dragon""; when the fragile vulnerability of his character is exposed, the viewer learns the detective is chasing much, much more.
Holm plays Sir William Gull, an aging physician of Britain's royal family.  The good doctor is so calm, cold, reserved, detached, and calculating I'll wager he could freeze the mercury on a thermometer.  Holm and Depp easily carry this movie, augmented by haunting images of avarice, brutality, and a less than complimentary portrayal of the freemasons.  FROM HELL is a seat-squirming, stomach-twisting thriller.  And the film gave me an added bonus:  I now have plenty of cold pizza for breakfast.

1440577,3,B00005JKJM,"I bought this purely for Johnny Depp, and it did sound like an interesting story. Right at the start, there's a lovely shot of Johnny's eyes, but when you hear people getting stabbed, it's so realistic, and so horrible! Sends shivers up your spine. There are a few familiar faces in this - Lesley Sharpe, Robbie Coltrane & Ian Holm.
The soundtrack is quite haunting and creepy, although the bit which really sticks out in my mind, is the heartbeat which appears faintly in the background when Johnny appears on screen, and steadily gets louder. It's a brilliant sound effect to use.
The one thing I noticed about Johnny's character (Inspector Fred Abberline) was that he seemed to be reprising his role of Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow. Very similar characters. His English accent is surprisingly good, considering some of the other actors who have tried and failed in the past. (Not naming any names, but Keanu Reeves springs to mind!)
There's some lovely shots in this including close ups of Johnny's eyes, a cracking shot of Big Ben against a red sky, and the whole film seems to capture the essence of London in 1888 perfectly.
Heather Graham (Mary Kelly) has always annoyed me as an actress, for no particular reason, and I tend to avoid films with her in them. The red hair in this was a big mistake, she's very pale skinned to begin with, and the redness washes her out even more.
To begin with, it was hard to work out whether the character played by Robbie Coltrane was superior to Johnny's character. Later we find out that he was a sergeant. He plays the part of a sarcastic, temperamental policeman, a role which he is well known for, and particularly good at.
The film is an 18, due to a couple of scenes. The scenes where the `unfortunates' ""livelihood"" is removed, is particularly disgusting, and not a pleasant image to have in your head. You just need to see the reactions in the film to feel nauseous. Also the scene where a girl's throat gets cut is really graphic, and I thought Murron's throat in Braveheart getting cut was bad! This is much, much worse!
The ending of this totally threw my opinion of the entire film. Up until then, the film had been good. From Hell is a film about Jack the Ripper, but the Hughes brothers (Coen brothers, Wachowski brothers and now the Hughes brothers!) provided their own solution to the Jack the Ripper mystery. This has been an unproven and unsolved mystery, so I didn't like how they decided to ""solve"" the mystery. It should have been left well alone. It seems like they wanted to wind up the story, so chose any random character to be Jack the Ripper. It doesn't work.
This isn't really a horror movie, more a dramatisation, and there was a lack of tension as a thriller. Definitely a must-see for Johnny Depp fans, and people interested in the Jack the Ripper mystery - although the ending doesn't really match the rest of the film.

1440590,5,B00005JKJM,"First I'd like to explain why I gave this movie five stars, despite the fact that it relies more on atmosphere than fact to carry it along. I have been an avid 'ripperologist' for many years, but it is apparent that From Hell does not wish to be taken as a close account of the reign of Jack the Ripper. It makes no effort to be true to the real evidence (although is in some instances), but has taken the essence of the legend and given it a twist. Or several. Therefore, judging it purely on its merit as a horror film, I am left with little option but to give it 5 stars. There. Wasn't that long and boring?
Now to the film...
Johnny Depp is (a rather amazingly attractive) Inspector Fred Abberline, an opium addict who often finds the answer to his cases through dreams induced by 'chasing the dragon'. In other words, somewhat of a psychic drug addict. He is, I am afraid to say, the only major actor in the play who is able to carry off the Whitechapel accent... Heather Graham, who plays the unfortunate Mary Kelly, has no such luck and there seems to be no real reason why someone of Irish origin should talk with an Australian/Cockney/American accent. Perhaps a character study on a prostitute with complicated heritage? Perhaps...
In the beautifully directed, dreary, gas lamp lit backstreets of Whitechapel, the Hughes brothers create terror, suspense and deliver the gore we would all expect, without making it impossible to watch. It is a chilling, fascinating, sickening journey into the mind of a deranged serial killer, with an interesting choice of conclusion which undoubtedly adds to the originality of the film.
It's a horror movie with gore, atmosphere, Depp and the chilling setting of the poorest area of Victorian London, which in itself is a frightening enough concept. All actors are on top form, Graham, Ian Holme and Robbie Coltrane, but as his fans or indeed any movie critic will know by now, Johnny Depp not only acts a film. He steals it. Superb.
You think you know terror... but you don't know Jack!",1065312000,4,2032,4.647222222222222
1440591,2,B00005JKJM,"This 2001 film was produced and directed by the Hughes Brothers and based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  As you know, graphic novels are actually comic strips and, even though there is no animation in the film, ""From Hell"" has the look and feel of that kind of exaggeration throughout.
In 1888, there were some real and unsolved murders of prostitutes in London by someone nicknamed Jack the Ripper.  That's what this story is based on.  It stars Johnny Depp as the inspector who must solve the case.  He loves to do drugs and in several scenes he's either smoking a pipe in an opium den or cooking up some laudanum at home.  His visions become clues to solving crimes and he's good at his job.
The murdered women are always surgically violated and this leads the good inspector to suspect that the murderer knows a lot about human anatomy.  And so he seeks out the medical establishment to help him and we all see more than we ever wanted to know about lobotomies.  The camera doesn't actually focus on details of the murders themselves, but there is so much talk about them and they are described so graphically, that it made me shudder with disgust.
There's the search for the killer of course, and there's also a romance between the inspector and a pretty young woman played by Heather Graham who sure could use a few lessons in acting.  Ian Holm is cast as the royal surgeon and, as the plot thickens, one of the suspects is even a member of the royal family.  I found it all quite silly as well as disgusting although I think it captured the spirit of the myth of Victorian England as a harborer of dirty streets and dirty secrets.
The film is intoxicating in a way, moved fast, and set up a mystery that was intriguing.  But there were so many absolutely sickening scenes that I soon grew to hate it.",1064448000,2,1830,4.452095808383233
1440592,4,B00005JKJM,"The mystique behind the real identity of Jack the Ripper is probably the only reason why the case has remained interesting for this long. Over 100 years later, the case has never been solved, though there are plenty who claim to know who the real killer is. Enter the Hughes Brothers and their adaption of the popular graphic novel, From Hell. As a movie, it is intelligent and well made, with strong performances and plenty of twists.
Johnny Depp gives on of his most memorable performances as Inspector Abberline, who in real life was assigned to the Ripper murders and retired having never solved the case. He is a drug-addicted police inspector who has a reputation for solving crimes through his clairvoyance. His abilities and loyalties are put to the test when prostitutes in Whitechaple, a slum of London, are murdered most foul by the Ripper. The story is nothing new, but new life is breathed into it by the Hughes Brothers artful direction and Rafael Yglesias's colorful screenplay. Also giving stellar performances are Robbie Coltrane as Abberlines intellectual partner, and Ian Holm as the doctor assisting in the investigation. Less than stellar is Heather Graham, though, and her presence as Mary Kelly (one of the victims) and the contrived love story that ensues is the one Achilles heel in this movie.
With 2 editions of this DVD out now, the 2-disc set is the one to go with. The well put together ""Jack the Ripper: Six Degrees of Separation"" is an examination on the murders, the suspects, and the investigation. But the best of all featurettes is actually a hidden easter egg. Highlight ""Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder"" on Disc 2, and quickly press down and right. You'll see a surgical tool highlighted and it will take you to a 40 minute documentary called ""Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution"" (snippets of which are seen in the interactive parts of the first featurette). This was produced in 1980 and features an interview with author Stephen Knight, who wrote the book on which the graphic novel, and this movie, is based. It is a fascinating documentary, and one that sketches broad strokes on the killings and the conspiracy that covered them. The other good featurette is the aformentioned ""Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder"", which is a breif lesson on the history of the notorious drink, and it's impact on culture and art. Skippable is the horrible Heather Graham-hosted ""A View From Hell"", which is a retread of well-known facts. Perhaps good for one or two viewings is the Hughes Brother's ""Tour of Murder Sites"", where they walk you around the From Hell set is Prauge. It would have prefered a tour of the actual murder sites.
A lot of people didn't like this movie, calling it a glorified slasher movie. While the violence is plentiful, the intelligence of the script and the style if directon make this distinction unfair. It is a great movie, and the 2 DVD treatment will provide you with hours of entertainment, as well as a history lesson on the Jack the Ripper case.",1061164800,12,3017,4.803846153846154
1440593,2,B00005JKJM,"I purchased this movie on a whim, and am now seriously regretting it. The film is excessively gory, so much so that I spent half the film with my eyes shut, screaming. If serious blood, guts and gore (we're talking about the ritual slaughtering of female hookers in London) do not bother you, then I would suggest it. Me, I don't have the stomach for it. But the plot line is good, and it develops well during the movie, although it does take some time to get into the plotline. Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as Inspector Aberline, although his opium-induced ""visions"", like his flashbacks as Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow (if you're looking for a suspenseful, Johnny Depp period film, this the one I would defintely recommend), are sometimes too violent to watch. Heather Graham, who, like Johnny, has affected a rather convincing Cockney accent for the role, gives a good performance as Mary Kelly, the [tart]. All in all, I probably won't be watching it again any time soon, but for a less squeamish person (and I mean a MUCH less squeamish person, because the images of the dead bodies were enough to disturb me) it might be worth a rental.",1060646400,3,1148,4.632352941176471
1440594,5,B00005JKJM,"I am somewhat confused. This movie is not based on real events, rather, it is based on a comic book adaptation by Alan Moore. Admittedly, it is a bit gruesome, nonetheless, I found it to be very entertaining. I have never seen a movie that captured so well the fin de siecle ambiance of the late Victorian Age; it was as if I had been transported to London in 1888 (I have never been there, but this movie has an allusive effect). It is a shame that so many reviewers expected a sort of high budget docu-drama. After watching this movie, I suggest that you listen to one of Mahler's later symphonies. It is too bad that absinthe is illegal, for that would be the perfect accompanyment. A smattering of Poe or Conrad would not hurt either. Unfortunately, most of us are more comfortable with the trappings of the early twenty-first century rather than the late nineteenth. As Michael Chichton has said, most of us are temporal provencials. Take a trip to the past via literature and you may have more appreciation for this very sublime and exquisite movie.",1059782400,3,1055,4.587301587301587
1440595,3,B00005JKJM,"The infamous story of ""Jack the Ripper"" and his five known victims is one of the few true-life horror stories that is as equally disturbing as anything the sick and twisted mind that calls itself ""Hollywood"" has ever made up. After all, ""Jack"" and his crimes existed well over a century ago, and his name and story are still common knowledge.
Shocking even by modern standards, in 1888 what ""Jack"" did to five city prostitutes was downright unheard of - I'll spare you the gruesome description and even recommend that you cover your eyes and ears for that part of the movie. It's a strange thing to call a serial killer ""great"", but if one ever was, ""Jack"" was the greatest, right down to the fact that he was never caught.
One hundred years later, what no one wanted to face then, is now too obvious to ignore. ""Jack"" had to be someone with a top-of-the-line knowledge of human anatomy, something that only an educated man could have had. Not to mention, that being the most-wanted man in England and never getting caught, would require that you reside in the last place anybody would ever look, such as a comfy, upper-class seat on the social ladder.
This scenario, that the murderer was actually one of the guys running the show, is what the Hughes' brothers' `From Hell' centers around.
Johnny Depp stars as the sleepily dispassionate, middle-class detective, Fred Abberline, who is slightly psychic and unashamedly tired of life. Abberline is put in charge of the investigation when a middle-aged prostitute is murdered in an indescribably violent fashion. After another woman of the same social situation is killed the same way, Abberline seeks out their friends, to find out whether the fact that these two women knew each other is coincidence or not. The standout among these ladies of the night are Irish-born Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), an eye-catching, younger woman who resorted to working the streets when her mother died. Seeing as Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are both attractive and famous, a romance blossoms between their characters, which ultimately serves the purpose of giving Abberline a reason to care about who the next victim will be.
In retrospect nothing worth going into detail about happens, as far as the plot is concerned, after Abberline and Kelly meet; but while viewing the movie there are few dull moments.
Heather Graham, who annoys me mainly because I don't understand what's so special about her, gets a passing grade as a street-smart prostitute whose fate is one of the bigger flaws in the accuracy of the story. Johnny Depp, whose acting talents are seemingly limitless, saves a role that could have easily seemed bland or nondescript if played by another actor.
Although not without flaw, for the most part `From Hell' is not a horrible movie. Its diversion from the truth is a tad annoying, and its sloppy attempt at an explanation as to why things actually happened the way the movie suggests, yet history tells us the identity of ""Jack the Ripper"" was never discovered, is a little too confusing.
The movies best points are style and scenery. Having never lived in London in the late nineteenth century, I do not actually know what it would be like; however, it certainly feels like the Hughes' brothers have successfully captured that feeling.
I give it three stars, because although the plot was inconsistent and the characters were under-developed, the acting was good and method superb.",1059523200,2,3438,4.888698630136986
1440596,5,B00005JKJM,"This movie is absolutely amazing.  It's one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of.  Johnny Depp was amazing in this movie, as he is in all of his movies.",1058572800,,193,3.923076923076923
1440597,4,B00005JKJM,"A classy movie, with a very talented cast, headed by the always-superb Depp. So why only four stars? Well, like some other viewers, I felt that it lacked that final something to make it an irresistible movie.
Perhaps the one thing that made me skeptical from early on is the way the film followed the Masonic Conspiracy Theory set out by Stephen Knight in Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution. Without giving anything away,  the Ripper that Depp uncovers - a real-life person of the time - was believed to have been geographically excluded from the possible suspect list, in that for one or more of the murders, he was nowhere near London, let alone Whitechapel.
Curiously, the movie doesn't make much of the 'From Hell' letter that gave the film its name. This letter, written in blood-like red ink, was believed to have been one of only two letters that may have been sent by the Ripper - all the rest being hoaxes.
The actresses who played the prostitutes were simply magnificent, which created a human aspect to the drama that was essential to involving the viewer. What happened to those women was unforgivable and the movie succeeds in making the point that they were innocent victims of circumstance, who only followed their 'profession' out of poverty and desperation.
The psychic element whereby Depp's Abberline can 'see' some of the murder details is a very interesting feature and lifts From Hell onto another level.
As far as the Catholic prostitute carrying a Royal baby theory goes, there have been so many illegitimate children to royalty over the centuries that such an event need not have been enough to trigger such a systematic campaign of brutality. Even given that the Prince allegedly 'married' the Catholic prostitute in an apparently legal ceremony with 5 ... witnesses, needn't have been much of a cause for concern.
Remember, in those days, the Government was all-powerful and any official denial backed by the mere threat of extermination would have been enough to take care of any attempt to exploit the situation via the Press.
Who was the Ripper? Either a totally unknown local man, who had worked as a porter in the morgue of a teaching hospital, or somebody acting as part of a Conspiracy group. But not driven by something so mundane as a royal baby. Yet perhaps involving a bloodline infinitely more precious and therefore dangerous. A sacred bloodline, a holy bloodline. And MARY Kelly did get away. Now that would make a more original plot twist.
A trifle unimaginative, but this is still a great movie and well worth the typically excellent Amazon.com price.",1058313600,,2595,4.857787810383747

1440639,3,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is an enjoyable, stylish retelling of the Jack the Ripper story.  The focus of the movie is not so much on Jack, though, as on the opium-addicted, absinthe-using Inspector Abberline, who pursues him.  The inspector is played by Johnny Depp, who continues to turn out one brilliant performance after another, even in not so great movies.
Not so great?  Well, yes: unfortunately, under all the (admittedly well done) suspense and atmospherics, From Hell is sadly lacking in emotional depth.  The Ripper's mounting body count doesn't seem to elicit the kind of real terror and paranoia that might be expected given the circumstances.  The relationship between Abberline and the prostitute Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, is unconvincing and lacks resonance.  This is partly due to ""Roller Girl""'s limitations as an actress, but most of the blame belongs squarely to the script, which just doesn't do enough to develop the story to its fullest.
Having said that, there is a lot to like here.  Some of the supporting performances are excellent, notably Robbie Coltrane as a police sergeant and Ian Holm as a high-placed surgeon who helps Abberline grapple with the forensics of the murders.  There are also some nice touches relating to the rigid class divisions of Victorian England.  From Hell is basically an above average suspense thriller, a flawed effort, but more intelligent than most entries in the genre.",1056153600,,1425,5.107758620689655
1440640,3,B00005JKJM,"Normally, I place a greater emphasis on story (the plot and character development) over style (the atmosphere and camera angles).
Of course, the Jack The Ripper mystery has captivated the world for more than a century, so the story automatically has you hooked before the movie even starts. If you weren't interested, you wouldn't be watching.
I fault the ""From Hell"" storyline on the basis of its resolution -- not that it was implausible (many serious historians share the same theory.) It just wasn't original. A television mini-series with Michael Caine and the 1978 Christopher Plummer-as-Sherlock Holmes feature, ""Murder by Decree,"" drew nearly the exact same conclusions.
But ""From Hell"" is a treat for the eyes, dazzling sets, intriguing lighting, mesmerizing flashes of color, moody and, yes, bloody. The gore is not overwhelming or distracting, though.
""From Hell"" stands apart from other Ripper flicks in that it is wonderfully stylish, and Johnny Depp adds another convincing portrayal of yet another tormented character to his resume. Thus, I'll give the movie three stars.
Give ""From Hell"" credit for its look, but shame on the moviemakers for essentially retelling the ""Murder by Decree"" story 20-some years later and presenting it as if they had a fresh solution to the Ripper mystery.
How 'bout a movie with ""From Hell's"" style and the completely shocking ending of ""The Night of the Ripper,"" the 1984 book by Robert Bloch in which the killer is aided by a seemingly sweet woman? That movie would be a five-star classic.",1055548800,2,1537,5.103174603174603

Although, we follow Jack the Ripper anonymously until the end (good choice), I feel that they should have left his character at more of a mystery since no one really knows who he was anyway.

In the featurette the producer even admits they didn't have the guts to base the film around the murderer himself. Instead we have a formulaic hollywood take. Depp is horribly miscast and gives an unusually lazy performance that doesn't go beyond a mere caricature of a certain contemporary London accent. Coltrane merely waltzes through the movie as a rather pathetic sidekick. The set though nice to look at is far too clean and lacks any real atmosphere. It's size appears to have had a limiting effect with London's multitude of the unwashed completely absent but for a few stragglers. The essence of the great city lost. What really lets the movie down is the total absence of the passion and outrage of the book. Their is no anger, the social conditions are merely glossed over. The satanic freemasonic overtones of the novel are nowhere to be seen. Basically anything of interest from the novel has been as surgically removed as Mary Kelly's heart. All in all a big mess that fails to do justice to the book. I urge you to buy the source material rather than give this a second glance.",1049587200,6,1195,4.695238095238095
1440646,3,B00005JKJM,"This movie takes the view of there have been two killers in the infamous Jack The Ripper slaying at White Chapel. One being the henchman of a respected doctor who is also a part of the ruling Masonic Lodge of the day who recognizes that there are certain forces inherant in certain symbols, such as The Pentagram {a victims with which he configured in its symmetry, positioning several relics and remnants of the victim therein.}
It is eventually divulged that all of the slayings were committed for purposes according to his particular and peculiar purposes. He believed himself to be the incarnation of iconoclastic forces that would bring the 20th century into fruition; but even his Masonic brothers viewed his views as too extreme and ended up condemning him to a lobotomy - the preferred method of treating the perceived mentally-ill.
We are introduced to several prostitutes of the day; filthy, dirty, crass, diseased, and minimalistic in hygiene practices as well as teeth. However, it was a bit sad and disheartening to witness how these women of pulchritude were treated, considering they do provide a popular service to the citizens of London. Yet these are the types of blindlight-rooted cultures which produce the most mindlessly habitually hate-filled hypocrites in such societies.
Grapes play a role in the slayings, as each sacrifice was given a single vine of exquisite grapes to consume, along with a vial of some liquor, both of which each woman consumed in tandem with ravenous delight. And that was their final indulgence. They were forthwith dispatched and their disemboweled innards left artfully positioned around the corpses, which would subsequently manifest a theory in which the killer may have been an artist. But this film focuses on the surgeon analogy, with the chief investigator {played by Johnny Depp} ironically quite schooled in the forensic arts, who himself demonstrates his peculiarities such as indulging in the Green Demoness Absinthe, which he meticulously mixes with an amount of six drops of laudanum, a well-known poison, to form an amazing intoxicant alight with the blue flame to fully integrate the ingredients to this forbidden elixir, concocted like an expert Alchemist. He dwells in blissful rapport there in his tub, luxuriously partaking in this ""Alchemist's Delight"".
The Phantom of White Chapel strikes again and again, the gleam of his cold blade shimmering in the moonlight, tainted red by crimson life. The figure in black with his top hat and silver-tipped cane disappears into the fog, and the mystery continues.
The film derives its nomenclature from a brief letter mailed to the Police station accompanied by a sliver of the woman's kidney, the other half which he happily consumed, and mentioned that it was ""very nice."" Signed, ""From Hell"".
Understandable, considering it had been filled with a choice blend of the liquor and grapes, stewed in its own juices. So it was revealed that the killer was also a cannibal. Strains of Hannibal Lechter as well as The Zodiac Killer are influenced here.
Another interesting occurrence transpired when someone had left a now infamous message on the wall at one of the bloody scenes:
""The jewes {sic} are not the ones that will be blamed for nothing.""
So it was both divulged that the perpetrator was a somewhat literate man, and not some savage or Gypsy as was alleged thus far. But this incident also may lead the viewer to consider that message may have been an attempt to redirect attention away from the correct path of inquiry, as well as establish a good bit of aggravation towards the many-times convenient scapegoats that have been Jews. This introduced a religious as well as an aesthetic connotation to divert attention away from the Masons, who were the underground ruling class portrayed by the film; the social elite whose cult was alleged to run England at the time, with its esteemed members merely going through the motions with The Church of England; the politics of enacting mass behavior on the surface in order to maintain positions of leadership while preserving true to one's roots in private.
By and by, the clues manifest themselves until eventually, the investigator is face to face with an esteemed doctor he admires, whose delusions of grandeur drove him into the halls of infamy.
Overall, a dark production arranged in a cinematic style reminiscent of Coppola, yet not as perfectly hewn. ""From Hell"" is yet another subnote in the legendary of a socio-psychopathic ""madman"" whom some would hail as a genius.",1048896000,4,4538,5.052

Having taken a Jack the Ripper tour in London, the murder places look almost identical to the real thing. However, the movie itself is not very terrifying, and sometimes, its's boring! Johnny Depp was just not suited for the role, because as he always is, he plays a far too mellow character with little feeling just as he did in Sleepy Hollow. Heather Graham, on the other hand, does great with her charm and beauty to the point of when she is killed, you can really feel a sense of compassion for her. But Ian Holm steals the show, delivering a riveting and chilling performance as Jack the Ripper. He's so good he's scary, and in this movie, he doesn't look at all like a little old man at all. He is truly menacing in the role. Also, the murders aren't well carried out, except for the last one, the murder of Mary Kelley. There, it is so gruesome and violent and depicted with such horror, that it is one of the most well orchestrated killings in movie history! As a whole, the movie captures the feeling of Jack the Ripper and the murders, but it is hard for the audience to become wrapped up in the storyline or characters, and lack of terror drags this beauty to being a lackluster film.",1045440000,,1358,4.436

1440673,4,B00005JKJM,"""One day men will look back and say that I gave birth to the Twentieth Century."" - Jack The Ripper, in From Hell.
 On October 19th, 2001, 20th Century Fox Entertainment released a chilling movie that dealt with crime, prostitution, drugs, and one of the most infamous murder cases in all of history. Wielding a daunting title and a star studded cast, directors Albert and Allen Hughes captivated audiences that autumn with their startling film, From Hell. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham star in this frightful interpretation of the 1888 killing spree that introduced the world to the name of Jack The Ripper. Depp plays the part of Inspector Fred Abberline, the psychic detective that is sent down to the seedy Whitechapel district of London to investigate the Jack The Ripper case. Abberline lives in an opium-induced state of euphoria that he needs in order to deal with the pain that was incurred by the loss of his wife and child. He was chosen to investigate the case for his cryptic ability to be able to see the murders within his mind before they occur. Graham, meanwhile, is one of the impoverished harlots that take to the streets of Whitechapel, in search of a means of getting by, but ends up being caught in the midst of the slayings and eventually becomes a target herself. The movie also stars Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, a physician to the Royal Family and Robbie Coltrane as Abberline's closest and most trusted friend, Peter Godley.
 From Hell was a very successful film. It was critically acclaimed (Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up), and it did well at the box office, opening to 2,305 theatres, gaining the number one slot and grossing ... million[s]in it's first weekend, ... In fact, From Hell represented the first time that the popular, seasoned actor Depp has ever had a number one movie. These facts alone allow us to see as to how this movie would be able to fall into the criteria of popular culture by being well liked such an array of people. The Los Angeles Weekly called From Hell ""Less of a horror film than a classical film noir. Depp and Graham... have the gravitational force of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly."" The movie proves that there at times can be little to no distinction between high and popular culture, as while it was incredibly favoured by the people, it also contains the art and intrigue characteristic of most high culture. Facts supporting that statement begin with the casting. First off, by casting Depp as Abberline, they get a man who is famed for his involvement with less hyped, although critically acclaimed films such as Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco, plus off-beat characters like George Jung in Blow, Ichabod Crane in Sleepy Hollow and the title role in Edward Scissorhands. The movie also gains heavily in terms of high culture by casting Ian Holm, who was made famous by his role in Chariots Of Fire and by being knighted in 1998 and also Robbie Coltrane who gained fame by playing the lead role in the heavily acclaimed television series Cracker.
 From Hell was a fantastic piece of popular culture that allows the viewer to experience for themselves the terror and pandemonium that was caused in the fall of 1888 during the height of the killing spree of the ""Whitechapel Murderer."" It takes us to a time, place and era that have been long forgotten and forsaken, locked away in the files of the unsolved mysteries. The scariest part of all though, is that it is so real. The names of the prostitutes, the detectives, the suspects and even the manner in which people were dealt with are all real. Through a combination of acceptance by the masses as was stated previously, and even an acceptance in the elite circles, From Hell has proven itself to be a part of Popular Culture.",1044489600,,3747,4.682852807283763
1440674,5,B00005JKJM,"This film was a delight. The ominous element of the cinematography was perfect for the setting. The use of pale green and other colors were great in contrasting the desired emotional effect from the scenes. Johnny Depp is perfectly dreary in his detective role. This is a story about Jack the Ripper. It has an intelligent plot, which leads to the culprit. If you can get the director's edition, it has a little more to offer. Be careful because they look very near the same as far as the cover goes. The director's version will say so across the top on the front. Overall I liked this movie very much.

1440677,3,B00005JKJM,"The whole movie is a sad story; at the beginning, it depicts the life of the East End prostitutes (bangtails); they are craving for money and are harassed by the Nichols gang who are exploiting them. One of them, Ann Crook, a very beautiful and very nice girl, was secretely married to Prince Edward Albert Victor, duke of Clarence, and five of her prostitute friends attended the ceremony. One night, policemen from the Special Branch, Metropolitan Police, take Ann and her baby girl away. Ann is sent to a hospital; she is said to be crazy and dangerous, so the doctors decide that she needs very crude brain surgery (she receives three taps on the skull and into the brain). She becomes just the shadow of her previous self, and is imprisoned in a work house. Then four of her prostitute friends are savagely murdered, and each time some organs are removed from their bodies (the uterus, the liver, the heart etc.). The killer is dubbed Jack The Ripper, uses grape to attract his preys (that was a rare and sophisticated fruit in London at that time), and gives them wine laced with laudanum to make them weaker. Inspector Abberline is in charge of the case; he falls in love with Mary Kelly, the fifth friend of Ann. He is addicted to drugs. He manages to find the killer: it is Sir William Gull, physician of the Queen and a freemason fulfilling a duty (silence witnesses of the secret wedding). Unfortunately, Gull kills Mary and rips her body apart before Abberline can stop it. When the Queen learns what really happened, she is angry about the methods used. Gull is accused and tried by the freemasons for ""mayhems that jeopardized his brotherhood"". He suffers the same treatment as Ann... Finally, Abberline is so sad and depressed by the death of Mary that he commits suicide through  drugs overdose.
So much for the sad, sad story.
For the rest, the movie is also generally sad, with ugly images of disgruntled bodies, plenty of flies around, a very somber atmosphere, and a scenario which at times is a bit difficult to follow.",1043884800,2,2040,4.666666666666667
1440708,5,B00005JKJM,"Some folks compare this to that Pitof's latest flick, ""Vidocq"".Yeah,they are the similar genre. You know that gory-psyco-sicko-gloomy-shady-dusky-dark and adventurous detective searches and small body parts of sings those lead to decisive ends. That kinda of stuff. But, I enjoyed this one.'cos it was much better and more realistic than its precedents.
  The plot was about Masons, sicko Masonic rituals, jews in this masonic cycle and our ""Jack the Ripper"" emerges from those brothers. He kills whores for his masonic beliefs. That comes too much even for the Brotherhood and he is judged in their own courts-Similar kinda story was also in the german movie ""Anatomy""-.
  Some people maybe find it too fantastic but I really saw them-the Masons- sucking a young goats blood in a ritual secretly filmed by a voyeur camera and we heard some uglier things about them.
 The film is too much complicated even for a careful viewer. You gotta watch it at least twice to fully understand it.

1440709,3,B00005JKJM,"The cinematography is great, the sets are amazing. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham, the man who plays the henchman 'Medly' and the French girl are miscast and it hurts the film. The Hughes Bros. show little enthusiasm for the film and the script was atrocious, which is a shame with a set like that, someone should have made a damn good film! Every other actor is perfect, I'm not kidding! I especially liked Robbie Coltrane. Just the 'feel' of the movie you get as you watch it, you can almost believe it's real, until Depp or Graham show up. Now, I like Depp, but he was just almost passable in the role. He plays the baby-faced young Abberline, who is a psychic drug-addict. Now, it's not as stupid as it sounds in the film, but it doesn't belong, if he were drinking while touring the sets and getting a feel for the Ripper's stomping ground that would've been better. Graham is way too clean and London's streets would have been full of smog, so much so the public would cover their mouths with handkerchiefs. I love how slow this film can be, it's not typical action/slash. Jack the Ripper isn't even really in this, a goofy gravel-voiced evil guy is and he's boring. The royal conspiracy is only mildly interesting and the possibility of it is nil. They should have focused on the sets and recreating London at that time for an immersive time, maybe it should have been longer? They could have contrasted Merrick with the killer or mentioned that Merrick was a suspect to some unrealistically minded folk. They could have listed more than one idea, or given more time to the police and what they were doing, or how many years had passed with Jack tormenting whores (it felt like 7 weeks in the movie). Also, in a place with about 30, 000 whores, I doubt there would be a friendship between all the victims! The reason the film is called 'From Hell' is that Jack wrote that in some of his letters. Overall, the focus is an Abberline who didn't exist and is actually more dull than the real guy and the prostitutes who have a scary street life but their personal problems and lack of real characterization harm the whole thing.",1041120000,3,2131,4.523316062176166
1440710,4,B00005JKJM,New twist on the Ripper genre with foxy Heather Graham scores with its 1888 Whitechapel atmoshpere. Johnny Depp gives a bravura performance as the Ripper systematically or should I say ritually kills ladies of the evening. This one is not for the squeamish or light-hearted. Intense photography coupled with excellent musical soundtrack evokes some chilling moments that electrify the screen with sinister and provacitive imagery.,1041120000,,430,5.630769230769231
1440711,4,B00005JKJM,"Prior to owning this movie on DVD, I saw it in the theater and was taken, immediately, by its visual beauty...the recreation of Whitechapel is incredible, right down to the names of the streets and the attire of the extras. The Hughes brothers even managed to give the 'red sky' effect as an ode to contemporary inhabitants who said that the sky was blood red in the fall of 1888.
I am deeply interested in the Jack the Ripper crimes and consider it to be, as many others do, the premier ""whodunnit"" of all time. I feel that those liuke me who have some interest and/or knowledge of the crimes and those who have never heard of Jack the ripper before seeing this movie will be impressed.
Johnny Depp is wonderful as Inspector Abberline, right down to the East End accent he employs beleivably thorughout. Heather Graham (Mary Jane Kelly) is stunning to look at, although she is much too well kept and hygiene conscious to have been a prositute in 19th centruy London. Hollywood strikes again! This is and obvious deference to a beautiful star in an otherwise serious attempt to give historical accuracy to a period movie, if expected, although it must be said that the movie does not indulge most of the other main supporting actors and extras this way, i.e., these people look like residents of a slum who lived before the days of daily hygiene, dental care, etc.
The theory of the murders that is proposed is a popular modern one, first visited in the movie ""Murder by Decree"". Personally, this theory is far fetched to me and most others who have looked at the case, if for no other reason than the fact that there is not the slightest bit of evidence that the five ""canonical"" Ripper victims even knew each other, much less being a close knit group of friends as portrayed in the movie.
Ian Holm, as Doctor William Gull, is the star of this movie. He plays his part so smmothly and, at the end, his transofrmation is chilling and his descent into madness is both beleivable and stunning. Yet, the viewer may well empathize with him. Incredible.
The actresses playing Catherine Eddowes, Liz Stride, Annie Chapman, and Polly Nichols are all very good. It is critical that we empathize with them and we do, especially Liz Stride and Catherine Eddowes (Lesley Sharp).
My problem with the movie, as one who has substantial knowledge of the actual case, is the obvious and intentional historical inaccuracies that mar the movie. No, the movie is not rife with them, but those who know about the ripper case will be shocked to see a few things in an otherwise historically accurate picture. And I'm not talking about the theory of the case of the identify of the killer, which will always be open to disagreement. I'm talking about the demise of Inspector Abberline at the end of the film. Although cinematically well played, it will just bother some students of the case to see Inspector Abberline ""dying"" shortly after the cessation of the Ripper murders in the movie when the real Inspector Abberline lived for FORTY years after the last murder! There are other anachronisms, but they can be chalked up to cinematic license; for example Inspector Abberline is depicted as having ""visions"" of the killer induced by his opium habit. there is no historical evidence that Inspector Abberline had an opium habit, although allusions to his drinking have been made. The visions are a reference, I beleive, to the psychic Joseph Lees, who did come forth to help the police although his help was largely discounted. The Hughes brothers probably did not want to introduce another character and therefore choose to ""combine"" the characters and give Abberline the ""visions"".
All in all, a very good movie and the features on the DVD are wonderful, especially if you are interested in the Ripper murders and don't have a lot of technical knowledge about them. Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson are also great in their roles (George Godley and Chief Warren, respectively).
Although this movie is not as gory or graphic as one might think, it is not for the squeamish. The surprising ending will also be appreciated by students of the case who are familiar with some intriguing evidence from the actual murders (e.g. Mary Jane Kelly being seen by witnesses after she was murdered on Nov. 9th, 1888 and the alleged homosexuality of at least one of the victims) and does justice to realism, even if you don't agree with the conclusions.

1440713,5,B00005JKJM,"One of the most pleasant surprises about the two-dvd release of Hollywood's most recent Jack The Ripper tale ""From Hell"" is the fact that it's so stuffed full of extras, the movie itself is probably the least compelling aspect of the entire package. It's a brilliant marketing ploy in that even the film's detractors may want to get their hands on it simply for the bonus material. That said, fans of the movie will find themselves gleefully wallowing in the goodies that await them on disc two: the featurettes ""Jack The Ripper: Six Degrees Of Separation"" and ""Absinthe Makes The Heart Grow Fonder"" (an informative insight into the history of absinthe), a handful of behind-the-scenes shorts, and over twenty deleted scenes including the film's alternate ending (which is really more of an alternate take on the same ending). There are several hidden ""easter eggs"" as well, but by far the most worthwhile and interesting is a 40-minute documentary made in 1980 for British television that is said to have been the very inspiration for the graphic novel from which the movie was based. (This is most easily found by accessing ""Title 21"" on disc two using your player's remote control.) As a stand-alone title, ""From Hell"" is an atmospheric and well-acted tale that's long on fancy and short on facts, but when coupled with yards of complementary bonus material it's one release that celebrates the dawn of the dvd era and delivers a strong blow to the death of video tape.",1039996800,,1472,4.868525896414343

However, I found it unnecessary and disrespectful to the memory of Abberline to have him portrayed as a druggy and a ""psychic"".  The facts are interesting enough; why this embellishment?  To appeal to today's audience who seem to relish uncontrolled substances?  It is my feeling that most serious Ripper fans would not only be disappointed in this film, but also find it a very poor depiction of everyone involved, including the prostitutes.  They are much too ""pretty"" in this film.  Filmakers seem adverse to portraying these poor, unfortunate ladies of the evening as the sorry alcoholic, sometimes toothless and very ill women that they were.  But I guess audiences are more attracted to pretty faces then to reality.",1037404800,6,876,4.878378378378378
1440748,4,B00005JKJM,"Visually striking and ominous, ""From Hell"" takes the Jack the Ripper theories, twists and turns them, and even takes tremendous liberty.  For instance, Prince Edward's character is totally against the historical facts, and I'm surprised the royal family didn't have a hissie fit!
But, that aside, what emerges is a taut, somewhat psychedelic look at the heinous crimes of one Jack the Ripper.
The direction is good, but at times, there was some difficulty in understanding a lot of the accents.  The art direction and set decoration, costuming, and music are brilliant.  What a horrible vision they painted of Londin the late nineteenth century.
I think Johnny Depp has done some really good work, including ""Sleepy Hollow"", but I found him a bit ineffective in this leading role.  His levels were forced, and he never really looked like he was truly in his role.
Heather Graham, in spite of her bad accent, still managed to offer a charming aspect to the life she had chosen.  I believed her most of the time, and was impressed with her performance.
Ian Holm, as always, was awesome.  This actor has done so much good work over the years, it's hard to see how he has not won an Oscar yet.  Remember him in ""Alien""---wow!  Here, he portrays a retired doctor who offers help to Depp in understanding the Ripper's killings.
Robbie Coltrane, also a vastly underrated actor, steals the scenes from Depp.  He conveyed not only his masculine side, but also his sensitive side, particularly in his relationship with Depp.
However, to me, the true stars of this movie were the ladies who portrayed the hookers.  None of them were really ""beautiful"" or even ""sexy.""  They looked like a bunch of fishwives done up in tight dresses with bodices exhibiting much cleavage.  But these ladies convinced me of their sordid lives and how much they really didn't like it.  Hats off to Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Kornik, Annabell Apsion, Joanna Page and Samantha Spiro.  They did fine work.  Also very good was Jason Flemyng in the role of the cab driver, Netley.
Overall, a good flick with much to recommend it.

This version portrayed the killer as a great docter and friend to Qneen Elizabeth and you cannot tell me that she did know about the killings about these five women who were friends with the young girl and the prince. She knew because she must have paid the good docter to do the deeds and denied young Alice her right to royalty that she deserved.

1440751,4,B00005JKJM,"There have been so many books, movies and TV shows about Jack The Ripper that you might think that the story had been done to death and that nobody would be interested anymore. However, The Hughes brothers ""From Hell"" proves that there will always be a demand for a quality production of a very grizzly true horror story.
Way back in the 19th century (in the fall of 1888 to be precise) one of the worlds first recorded serial killers brutally murdered five prostitutes (yes, only 5) bringing terror to London's east end slums. And whilst in terms of numbers modern serial killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer have been much more prolific, it seems that it is still Jack The Ripper's crimes that continue to still fascinate many people. Is it because of the brutal yet clinical way that the murders were carried out? Or is it because the case remains unsolved? Probably both but as The Hughes brothers, previously best known for the likes of Menace II Society, have set out to prove, that although long dead there are still plenty of `worthy' suspects.
Based on the Alan Moore/Eddie Campbell cartoon strip and using the very beautiful city of Prague to expertly recreate Victorian London, The Hughes Brothers' latest movie pitches the clairvoyant, opium partaking, Inspector Fred Abberline (an impressive Johnny Depp), aided by his assistant Peter Godley (the always excellent Robbie Coltrane) racing against time in search of history's most notorious murderer, in this very watchable and very enjoyable yarn. Adapted by screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the previously mentioned Moore/Campbell source material, From Hell manages to draw everybody from Queen Victoria to Oscar Wilde and the Elephant Man into the plot of this movie, which far from detracting from the true history of the attacks, actually adds a little more depth and a little more zest to this period thriller. To The Hughes brothers credit, this is not just another typical cheap and tasteless Hollywood slasher movie but instead it presents us with the full squalor, poverty and hardship that existed at that time, with the prostitutes presented as poor unfortunate human beings struggling against abject poverty to survive and finding consolation in alcohol. From Hell also boasts excellent performances of depth and subtlety not just from the likes of Depp (complete with a creditable cockney accent), Coltrane (Harry Potter) and renowned British stage actor Sir Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) but also notably from the likes of (despite a slightly ropey accent) Heather Graham, Lesley Sharp, Annabelle Apsion and the late Katrin Cartlidge (No Man's Land) as the prostitutes earning their living in the squalor that was London's east end.
In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed From Hell and would recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit more intelligent, well written and well acted, as an alternative to the traditional horror teen flicks which seem to dominate our movie theatres. Four stars ****.",1035244800,,2986,5.083503054989817
1440752,4,B00005JKJM,"I enjoyed this movie because it made an otherwise implausible, and actual hypothesis regarding Jack the Ripper, quite...probable! This should please anyone who is into conspiracy theories. I can't say much here, but the plot is very interesting, even if at times predictable. I thought it was neat because the script really nodded to several theories and events that really existed, and several real characters. Even Depp's character, Albernine(?), was an actual person- although the fictional and real person had very different destinies.
I love Depp- I think he's a fine actor. If you liked him in Sleepy Hollow, then you'll see echoes of that performance here- although in a much more darker tone. He was abe to give his character personality and dimension- here's a sensitive person, at many levels, who has suffered enormous loss- a loss which is mentioned in a few seconds, but is alluded to in the entire being of this character.
Heather Graham is lovely, and I thought she held her own quite well- except for the flirtation between her character and Depp's. There was absolutely no chemistry there- and I have to agree with the reviewer who panned the film for showing Graham as clean, radiant and lovely, while her colleagues, sharing in the same squallor and misery, were, correctly, more decrepit. You just cannot believe that Graham, clean, with all her teeth, and with nicely curled hair, is starving, as she claims. It was  distracting.
The visuals of the movie are great- like an absynthe-induced hallucination itself. It had its share of symbolism and although not too complicated, enjoyable.
I didn't find it frightening or overly graphic, although some of the images can be a bit disturbing.
I like it because I enjoyed seeing an actual theory come to life, and because Depp is so wonderful to watch.",1034553600,,1818,4.960655737704918
1440753,2,B00005JKJM,"On the plus side, the set designer did a splendid job of recreating Whitechapel of the 1880s, as well as the murder sites, based on period photographs and drawings.  The sets and details of the individual crimes have probably never been done better on film.  (I've lived in the East End of London and have seen photos too of the places that no longer exist, and I found the physical recreation truly superb.)  Again on the plus site is Ian Holm's chilling performance, although his changing eye color (from blue to black as he gets nuttier and then back to a pale cataract blue) may be off-putting for some.  On the negative side, the movie was based on a graphic novel that was in turn based on a discredited 1976 ""solution"" to the crimes.  More importantly, the same material concerning the royal link and the Freemasons was done far better the first time around in the 1979 ""Murder by Decree,"" based on the same original source.  Material was also based, at least as far as the ""identity"" of the Ripper, on the 1988 television miniseries, ""Jack the Ripper,"" starring Michael Caine as the detective.  Thus, the ""solution"" was not original and covered no new territory regarding ""Jack the Ripper.""  I also had a problem with some of the quick cuts and choppy scene continuity.  Also, the use of the lobotomy to quiet excitable mental patients was not, to my knowledge, being practiced in 1888, although it seems to be the method of choice in this movie. (If I'm mistaken in this, someone correct me.) As far as the DVD special features, I appreciated seeing Donald Rumbelow, a genuine expert on Jack the Ripper, being interviewed regarding some notable Ripper suspects, but then he is juxtaposed with another author, a quack theorist, who has no authority to recommend him. Although this is only an extra feature, it does sum up some problems with the film itself, an inability to discriminate between the brilliant elements and the banal.",1034553600,,1940,4.75
1440754,3,B00005JKJM,"""From Hell"" is an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name which follows the famous Jack the Ripper murders.  Johnny Depp plays the detective who is trying to catch the murderer, and befriends pristine prostitute Heather Graham along the way.  I believe that there must be more movies about serial killers than actual real life serial killers, but ""From Hell"" manages to put something of a fresh twist on the genre by rooting the Jack the Ripper story in a conspiracy that reaches, as they say, the highest levels of power.
The movie does try to recreate the look and feel of London in 1888, and there are a couple of breathtaking panoramic shots over the city, but much of the movie takes place in the pub and nearby street corners where the doomed prostitutes gather.  Somehow, despite the presence of some menacing pimps and the grisly murders that are the subject of the movie, the Victorian slums were not sufficiently violent and filthy.  My uninformed impression is that lower-class London during the Industrial Revolution was even much more dismal than portrayed in ""From Hell"".
Speaking of the murders -- I suppose after a long history of serial killer movies which show increasingly graphic scenes of mayhem and gore, a movie like ""From Hell"" has no choice but to follow suit.  The flashing knives and buckets of blood have no power to shock or entertain any more though (for me, at least).  I've come to think that it would be more terrifying to merely imply the violence and leave the details up to the viewer's imagination, but perhaps that was not an option for ""From Hell"", given that part of the Jack the Ripper legend stems from the violent dismemberment of the victims.
Johnny Depp's character does have some narcotic-fueled visions about the murders which are good and scary, and there are a few memorable moments as the conspiracy theory is revealed, but the movie still seemed rather too flat and predictable.  (I guess it doesn't help that I knew ahead of time how many prostitutes Jack the Ripper killed.)  I'll be generous and give it three stars, despite my serial-killer-movie-fatigue and my belief that London isn't shown to be nearly squalid enough.",1034208000,,2185,4.808
1440775,4,B00005JKJM,"In the catalog of unsolved murders, the crimes of Jack the Ripper reign supreme.  In all probability, they have inspired more speculation and creative work than have all the others combined.  Inspired by a graphic novel series, this effort by the Hughes brothers is another in a long history of productions, each seeking to draw us into the terrors of a century past, leaving us once again chilled and bemused.
One of the things that set 'From Hell' apart is its efforts at authenticity.  Costumes, characters and locale are minutely recreated.  We are granted a long glance into the squalid realities of life in places like Whitechapel with very little candy coating.  The conflicts between the bleak lives of London's prostitutes and the posh upper classes underline the fact that whatever the real motivation for the crimes, they were also symptomatic of a deeply divided culture.  Characters like Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) must tread the borders of both realms seeing only the worst that either has to offer.
It is only fitting that Abberline is a frequent user of opium who often has 'visions' that show him glimpses of the crimes.  Fitting, because his opponent, the killer also lives in a dream world of his own.  Abberline is a spectator forced to witness the inexorable artwork of the madman, desperately trying to puzzle out the motivations that set his nightmares in motion.  We the onlookers shift out viewpoints from killer, to investigator, to victim, and beyond.  For all that we have more information than Abberline; we come no closer to a solution.
Depp gives Abberline a certain fragility that contrasts with both the characters of the prostitutes he is struggling to save (led by Heather Graham as Mary Kelly) and the overwhelming self-confidence of those he serves.  As such he is a bit of a phantom when compared to the likes of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm).  This works quite well given that Abberline's own story can only begin to peak as The Ripper's draws to a close.
The film's explanation of the murders is one popular with many Ripper aficionados, and has been used in films before.  The Hughes do find a way to twist this in their own way at the end, providing a bit of a surprise for the most jaded.  While the production has more than its share of the grim and gory, the Hughes rarely indulge in purely gratuitous violence.  Horror, when it comes, is swift and sure.  We are not so much frightened as kept in a state of nervous anticipation.
The two discs of this set provide a beneficence of additional materials.  Features about everything from Ripperology to the use of Absinthe.  There is a tour of the recreated Whitechapel and full-length commentaries on the film.  The Hughes brothers really did go to extremes in their production and the extras provide much insight into compulsive filmmaking.",1033257600,3,2844,4.838842975206612
1440776,3,B00005JKJM,This film had alot going for it when it started but fell apart terribly at the end.  I have termendious respect for Johnny Depp as an actor and he has come a very long way.

1440777,5,B00005JKJM,"Johnny Depp is arguably the best actor of his generation, and this movie only furthers that belief.  The movie serves as a biography of Jack the Ripper, the first truly publicized serial killer who terrified England and most of Europe in the late 1800's.  Stylistically, the movie is stunning and the cinematography breathtaking.  The movie is historically accurate and presents a chilling account of the crimes and investigation of the the murders.  At times it is quite gory, but rightfully so.  Jack the Ripper did ritualistically butcher women, and this film does not shy away from it.  Depp delivers a brilliant performance as the opium-addicted detective in charge of the case, with a sharply forensic mind that places him at odds with his superior officers.  The only drawback of the movie is Heather Graham.  While she might be a good actress in other things, there's nothing in this performance that lends her character as necessary.  Indeed, she takes away from the film.  I'd much rather have seen Christina Ricci in the part, as she has a brilliant chemistry was Depp, as evidenced in Sleepy Hollow and The Man Who Cried.
Recommended because of Depp's performance and the faithful adaptation of the story.",1032393600,,1217,4.98019801980198
1440778,4,B00005JKJM,"Despite all the negative reviews, I really liked this film.  Sure, the material isn't new, but for once it's refreshing to see a story that's so blatantly in the realm of the exploitation film being tackled by A-list talent in Hollywood style.
The Hughes brothers have a gift for implementing extremely stylish techniques without seeming show-offy.  The ""absinthe"" visions in the film as experienced by Johnny Depp's character serve to enhance the mood rather than show off the latest cinematic trick.  The Hugheses do seem fond of extremely graphic violence as seen in Dead Presidents; in From Hell, when a cop says a victim is ""in pieces"", the directors show no mercy in sparing you the sight.  However, the highly grisly content has a purpose -- it deprives you of the sense of safety that a ""polite"" shooting style often yields, and it also blends the two ideas of social decay and aristocratic decadence which both the story and the cinematography express.
Depp does a fine job here, though the role of Inspector Abberline isn't exactly his most challenging.  But he is sympathetic and charismatic, projecting intelligence and a troubled psyche.  Heather Graham looks ravishingly beautiful, and I didn't have a huge problem with her accent -- certainly leagues above Julia Roberts' feeble attempt in Michael Collins.  Depp and Graham make for a great pair onscreen, and the screenplay has enough good lines to keep you interested throughout.  Ian Holm does walk off with the film, though, as supra-genius surgeon Sir William Gull.
For me, the only truly weak point of the film is the endless scenes with the streetwalkers.  They are a pretty colourful bunch, and there are some highly talented actresses in their midst -- including Katrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp, both of Mike Leigh's Naked, Estelle Skornik, and Susan Lynch, who did a marvellous job in the film Nora.  But the scenes with them are so repetitive that the film's pacing suffers.
Small gripe, though -- with amazing lighting and design (including painstakingly accurate recreations of the murder sites), good performances and a nice sense of forward momentum, this film is a good (and lavish) addition to the Jack the Ripper canon.",1031788800,2,2204,5.013698630136986
1440779,4,B00005JKJM,"This film was great in many regards.  For starters, the setting was excellent.  The Hughes Brothers paid very close attention to every little detail about the White Chapel district in London.  As for the story itself, I was impressed with how closely related this film was to many of the actual events that occured at the time.  The acting was great.  Johnny Depp is a magnificent actor, and he certainly didn't disappoint in the role of the Detective in pursuit of Jack the Ripper.  The murders themselves were very well done.  There was enough gore to keep any horror movie fan happy, yet they never got carried away by showing too much gore.  At times the film seemed a bit drawn out with some meaningless dialogue, but overall the script was decent.  I think that the whole storyline about the Mason's involvement in the murders could have been explained a little bit better.  Finally, I was a little disappointed with the ending.  Not with the fact that it wasn't a fairy tale ending, but more because Johnny Depp's character just seemed to fall apart too easily.",1031788800,,1068,4.688172043010753
1440780,5,B00005JKJM,"The movie ""From Hell"" gives the viewer a penetrating look into the murky underworld of nineteenth century England and the machinations of a cult of evil Freemasons.  This movie shows us the motivations of the infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper, an empire loyalist who slaughtered his prostitute victims in alignment with Freemasonic ritual.  It is a must see for those of us who dare to look into the mind of a madman hellbent on ridding England of it's ""vile element"" in the most unChristian of manners.",1031011200,,508,4.827586206896552
1440781,3,B00005JKJM,"For more than a century, the Western mind has been fascinated with the killing spree of Jack the Ripper that began in London in 1888.  A total of five prostitutes were slaughtered by a knife-wielding fiend who taunted the London constabulary with letters and clues as to his identity.  He was never caught or positively identified.  Many books, short stories, and films have dramatized the events of that brief period when London walked in terror.  The latest entry is FROM HELL, a movie which differs from its predecessors in that the focus is less on the Ripper and more on his victims. Directors Albert and Allen Hughes give the audience a grimy view of the Whitechapel district where the murders occurred.  This rather small section of London was notorious for its filth, prostitutes, street crime, and grinding poverty.  From the opening scene, the Hughes brothers use the camera as the eye of the typical Whitechapel resident. One could not walk a single block without being accosted by whores or derelicts. In the midst of all this squalor, a killer emerged to slice up helpless and hopeless prostitutes.  Police inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) is given the responsibility of catching the Ripper.  As Abberline goes about his business of gathering evidence, the viewer notices that the twin brother directors seem unsure as to whether they want the audience to cringe in fear or to wonder about the Ripper's identity.  This lack of desired audience response eventually becomes intrusive to the point that it interferes with an otherwise tightly controlled plot that builds to a surprise ending involving among other things some unexpected candidates as the Ripper. Recent critics of FROM HELL have criticised Heather Grahame as Mary Kelly, the only attractive prostitute in a circle of rather plain looking ladies of the night.  I see no problem with the physical appearances of any of the victims, since the squalor of their environment was not conducive to frequent beauty treatments.  I did see a problem with the character of Inspector Abberline.  Depp plays him as a semi-mystic drug-addled addict who ultimately is seen as not unlike the very miserable creatures whom he often arrests for petty crimes.  Abberline's opium-induced hallucinogetic visions are inserted more for their pyrotechnic value than for their supposed advantage of providing preternatural clues.  The film does have several strong points.  When Depp is not in a funk of drugs, he exhibits an increasingly deft touch of acting that allows him to register emotions that resonate both with victim and viewer.  Ian Holm as Sir William Gull is effective as the doctor who assists him to catch the Ripper.  But the real hero is neither the fine actors nor the rather unbelievably contrived plot exit.  What makes FROM HELL the memorable cinematic experience that is, is the sullen sense of a grinding background of poverty and social decay that made it possible in the first place for so many poor women to seek their daily bread at the outstreched hands of those who held out coins in one palm but a scalpel in the other.",1030492800,3,3102,4.990291262135922
1440782,3,B00005JKJM,"Although I found the plot to be incredibly like that in an earlier, excellent film MURDER BY DECREE, what really struck me about this telling of the Jack the Ripper story was that it brought back, brought 'home' if you will, the terror that the women must have experienced when these murders were happening, and usually the women in previous Ripper films seem to little better than props for the legend.  It reminded me that there were all too real victims of this man and no one deserves to die in that manner.  If only poor Mary Kelly had had the fate the movie gives her instead the one she really had.",1029542400,,605,4.392857142857143
1440783,3,B00005JKJM,"Johnny Depp seems to be drawn towards playing dark, brooding and troubled characters; he's so damned good at it ! Heather Graham releases a fine performance with her almost perfect accent.  Yet she's way too much of a knock out to be taken seriously as a late 1880' prostitute or ""wench"" while the other women looked filthy and harsh. Note how her Mary Kelly role is always the cleanest looking one of the bunch of...well, you know. What was fascinating was the alternate take on the Jack the Ripper murdering theory and who his true indentity was and the so-called diabolical motivation for doing what he did and to whom ! Also, the role the Royal British family patriarch figures into the whole plot. Wonder if the real Royal Family appreciated how their ancestral hierarchy was portrayed !
However, this film is not for the squeamish as there are several graphic violent blood and gore scenes. One scene in particualr is very disturbing since it depicts the Ripper doing what he does while another character holds the victim. The opium induced imagery adds to the already dark and dreary atmosphere for complete full effect...The ending is also, without giving it away, a complete surprise and shock.",1029196800,2,1203,4.839805825242719
1440784,2,B00005JKJM,"It's easy to see what the Hughes Brothers wanted to do with From Hell.  They aspired to show the seamy underbelly of Victorian London to reveal that it is just as hellish, if not more so, than the urban ghettoes of today.  So, in terms of atmosphere and overall presentation, From Hell is a well-done film.  But as an entertainment, it fails on two main levels.  First, it's predictable.  Like any slasher movie, you know the second one person breaks off from a group that they're going to die very soon thereafter.  And so the suspense drains out at a rapid pace.  The other problem is that the film is just too violent.  The ultraviolent sequences in the film have wincing quality to them.  Generally, you watch them and say to yourself, ""I didn't really need to see that.""  And you don't.  Violence is much more effective when it's implied rather than shown explicitly.
The cast is game, with nice turns from Ian Holm (wearing contact lenses much scarier than anything else in the film), Jason Flemyng, and Robbie Coltrane.  But with Johnny Depp doing an addict version of his character from Sleepy Hollow, and Heather Graham as the token girl-who's-way-too-good-looking-to-be-an-actual-prostitute-and-will-be-the-only-one-not-to-die, the leads feel flat.  Combine that with the Hughes Brothers choice to shock over generating genuine suspense, and From Hell is a disappointment.",1028073600,4,1382,5.116071428571429
1440825,2,B00005JKJM,"I wouldn't exactly call this movie a dissapointment, as I didn't really expect to be captivated by it in the first place. You must always approach a movie like this with expectations of it being anywhere from mediocre to aweful. And if you're lucky, you'll be pleasantly suprised. I was niether pleasantly suprised nor disgusted by this movie.
My reasons for seeing this movie were as follows: Johnny Depp (a fantastic actor) and Jack the Ripper (I enjoy mysterious and morbid stories....especially if they're true...i.e. The Manson Family murders, Jack the Ripper, Son of Sam etc...).
Johnny Depp of course lived up to his role as the actor who can play anything. I doubt if there's one movie in all of his credits in which he plays a character in a similar way. Perhaps he did not reach his full potential as an actor in this movie, but he certainly added to his ""never the same character"" list.
In terms of the Jack the Ripper aspect, I was originally skeptical of the storyline which seemed to be made up. But when I further researched the subject of Jack the Ripper I found that the storyline in the movie was not only quite possible but likely to be true.
Finally, and perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of this movie, the visuals of this movie were very well done. Rather than presenting a constant dark, grim atmosphere (usually presented with greys and blacks in murder films and with blues and greys in ghost films) From Hell was unusually colorful. Somehow, this use of color seemed to work with the movie rather than spoiling whatever tenseness we might be feeling while watching it. It was an intelligent use of color. The cinematography, though interesting and intruiging, played into the modern use of fast cuts and quick scenes (used to satisfy the ever shortening attention span of our young audience) and was less than original. Yet some speeded up shots tended to contribute to the eerieness and creepyness of the film (whatever small bit of it there was) rather than destroying it.
Finally, and perhaps the reason that this movie didn't have the spark it needed, it lacked depth...most espeically within the characters. The most depth we see in any of the characters is Johnny Depp's opium habbit, a single memory of his deceased wife, and Heather Grahm's memory of her little cottage in Ireland which is reffered back to about 3 times in the movie. Other than that, we are simply watching Jack the Ripper kill off a bunch of ""unfortunates"" (aka: prostitutes), Johnny Depp and Heather Grahm get invovled (kindof...? their relationship lacked depth as well), and a bunch of incredibly sick old guys have creepy secret underground meetings.
This movie is something to watch on a saturday night when you want to chill with your popcorn and maybe a few of your friends. It's not the kindof movie you would watch and have an in depth discussion of afterwards. It's purely for enjoyment (if it even does that for you) and should not be taken serriously.",1027987200,,2966,4.761165048543689
1440826,2,B00005JKJM,"While this film looks really nice and the camerawork is relatively impressive, it is finally a failure in filmmaking. By no fault of either the Hughes Brothers or Johnny Depp - the only mystery here is how such a talented group of people made a film like this. It isn't enough that the Jack the Ripper story has already been done in so many ways that it has ceased to be interesting, but here the identity of the ripper is telegraphed to the audience at such an early point in the film that it is laughable - like a Scooby Doo cartoon almost. Additionally, it's difficult to suspend disbelief at times - espescially when confronted with Heather Graham's rosy cheeked and milky complected prostitute - who shows her connection to the grotty and filthy streets she inhabits by her perfect straight white teeth and a smudge of dirt on her face. Ultimately a failure, but perhaps worth a rental.",1027900800,,891,4.610062893081761

The DVD comes full of extras for the die-hard fan (as DVDs should): commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes. In my opinion, however, the ""deleted scenes"" are actually ""deleted shots"" since most last no more than a few seconds.

1440828,2,B00005JKJM,"Although an extremly good idea to make a movie about Jack the Ripper, who caused fear and trouble in Whitechapel in England in 1888, however, this movie lacked the depth and most importantly, THERE IS NO FEELING OF TERROR at all. I've never read the comic book this flick is based upon, but as a movie fanatic, I could sense prediction and knew what was going to happen. The directors probably concentrated more on gore and splatter (and there are plenty of those) instead of the mystery and the theme that puts the audience into curiousity and left with a big question mark when they leave the cinema. Here we are given the story and the suspect, which we get to find out in this movie (no one ever knew who Jack the Ripper was, as we all know) from their point of view. There are very few scary/tense scenes, except maybe one or two small jump scenes.
The movie, however, is very accurate and convincing potraying the streets of England, with low-lives and bums everywhere, blended in with those richer folks, and carriages and the wet and dark alleys and crowdy streets. What saves the movie a bit is the visual: in the beginning we see London with a orange/redish sky marking hell in the horizon. There are stunning details in the movie. The actors (Depp and Graham) do a good job and have convincing Cockney/Scotish accent. The love story is very thin here as well. I won't mention the story and plot, but it is very predictable, EXCEPT the very end, the last scene.
In all, this movie isn't too good, with no real feeling of fear and terror, no mystery that should have been left unsolved, no psychological horror (which I think this movie should have been about, of course mixed with the gore and the blood), and no real structure in the love story between Depp and Graham. This is just another splatter movie that could have been a masterpiece.",1027468800,,1852,4.547904191616767

This film is very close to the actual events that occured, but the theater version made none of the connections the DVD does.....Indeed, I was very disappointed in the movie version and that is why it has taken me so long to view the DVD.....
Having done much research on these killings, I have constantly been unhappy with the way the Masons and the royality have been able to cloud the issue, providing their own ""Oswald"" as it were in an effort to protect Prince Eddy....who many still believe did the killings along with Walter Sickert and John Netly. (Walter Sickert was used to locate the 5, Netly and Eddy, or Gull, did the deeds)
This DVD cut Starts at Cleveland Street where the story begins and keeps many things in proper perspective: these were not randowm killings but executions, all the women knew each other and what was going on and why, (Marie Kelly was hiding, someone was paying for her room, possibly Sickert who was ""forced"" into the deal, and who helped Alice Crook survive) the investigation was controlled by the Masons in the person who took over the investigation until Marie Kelly was located. (I don't have the patience to look up all the names right now, but get the book ""Prince Jack"", or even Stephen Knight's book, and you will have them all, the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister, etc......in some ways this was England's JFK......
The deleted scenes should be added and re-released as a whole....and the fact that Gull and Aberline both died of natural causes is important too.

1440832,4,B00005JKJM,"The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than ""From Hell,"" directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed ""unsolvable.""  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.
It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results.
Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the ""girls,"" Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.
The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard.  But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery.  It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a ""fable-noir.""
Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow.""  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in ""Hollow.""  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.
Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a ""lady of the night.""  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.
The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story.
Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, ""Harry Potter's"" Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in ""Nora,"" opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.
The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the ""Ripper"" movies, ""From Hell"" is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.",1026950400,15,5569,4.815513626834382

1440834,4,B00005JKJM,"The Hughes Brothers bring us this surprisingly good, and maybe all too believeable, thriller based on the graphic novel of the same name.  Johnny Depp stars as an opium smoking Scotland Yard detective assigned to bring Jack the Ripper to justice by using his special ""talent"": smoking opium with some other drugs to have psychic visions, and naturally, it works.  Eventually Depp uncovers a vast conspiracy that even has links to the throne, and all is not what it seems.  Heather Graham stars as a prostitute who Depp falls for, and Ian Holm absolutely steals the entire movie as a washed up surgeon.  The cinematography is superbly shot, and Depp gives a fine performace as usual, but Graham is just not believeable in her role, not acting wise I mean, but she is just too beautiful to be a prostitute from that time period, the other actresses look their roles (no offense to them).  There are some nice DVD extras as well, and the entire package is well rounded, so if your a fan of Depp or are looking for a different type of thriller, there aren't many better choices than From Hell.",1026432000,,1089,4.6217616580310885

The DVD version offers over 20 deleted scenes with the parts leading to them and came after that were included in the film being in black & white, with the deleted scenes in color.  This was a nice touch.  I enjoyed the delted scene with the detectives running about with flashlights.  My wife said, ""Did they have flashlights back then?""  I said, ""That's probably why they deleted it!""
The acting in the film was very good.  Depp turns in his usual magical performance, always letting us sense a depth to the surface action.  Robbie Coltrane as the sidekick cop Peter Godley was appropriately loyal.  One of the deleted scenes in the library showed a great personal devotion which was a nice touch.  Heather Graham as Mary Kelly didn't look like life had been hard on her, other than having to wear a slightly soiled costume, but was a great love interest.  My favorite was Susan Lynch who bowled me over as Mrs. James Joyce in ""Nora.""  Here she plays the lesbian hooker Liz Stride with appropriate pluck.  Ian Holm as Sir William Gull did surprise me with his change at the end.  All in all, the sets are stunning, the story good, acting superb.  Not one to watch with your kids around, however...

1440866,1,B00005JKJM,"What a waste. Jack the Ripper is one of the most gory and horrifying peroids in London's history and a great subject for a movie.
Unfortunately this treatment fails on all levels. Despite a good cast the acting is consistently terrible and even though there are some creepy scenes I felt I was watching an Andrew Lloyd Webber production.
I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be a comedy or a gothic drama or a horror movie. As it turns out it is a bit of all three with some cartoonish aspects thrown in for good luck. After sitting through this rubbish I almost died laughing at the ending. scoody doo, where are you?",1026172800,3,621,4.408695652173913

And you know what? I didn't care. I still loved 'From Hell'. Because of the wonderful atmosphere of London of the 1880's. Because of the constant solid acting of EVERY actor, from Depp's wonderful Abberline and his Shakespeare-spouting sidekick, to Abberline's superior who-knows-more-than-he's-willing-to-tell to the terrified coachman-of-the-Ripper. But it's Ian Holm that takes the prize. I loved 'The Lord of the Rings', but if I have one gripe about it's that scene where Ian Holm's Bilbo changes fleetly in a Ring-grabbing monster. Well, look at 'From Hell' Peter Jackson, and you'll see that Ian Holm doesn't NEED special effects to change into a monster. The man's such a powerful actor, he can change from a benign dottering old family doctor to an obsessed mad Ripper-from-Hell in SECONDS. Without CGI! Bravo Ian!

1440868,5,B00005JKJM,"Since no one really knows the identity of the Ripper,it is always interesting to see the take authors and directors have on the subject. I found this film to be well-acted, and quite scary. Johnny Depp continues to excel in roles that are unusual,and he seems made for them. The sets are moodily authentic and show the horribly demeaning way women were forced to exist in the poorest section of London. The DVD contains extra material which make the price worthwhile. I recommend this film to all who enjoy a serious mystery and who can handle the necessary gore.(BTW: Another excellent Ripper film is ""Murder by Decree,"" with Christopher Plummer and James Mason as Holmes and Watson.)",1025654400,2,685,4.863247863247863
1440869,3,B00005JKJM,"Since no person currently alive probably knows the true identity of Saucy Jack, it automatically becomes open season for any writer who wants to tell the story.  Not that knowing the facts ever gets in the way of  the Hollywood version anyway.  Even when they have them, it's still a toss-up as to whether they will be used.  So if you are going to even attempt watching ""From Hell"", you have to accept that much of what you'll see is fabrication.
With that in mind, I'll only give away that this slant on the story declares that more than one person had knowledge of who was responsible, and in that case, was also responsible themselves.  Believe me, I'm not giving away that much, as it gets a lot more complicated than that.  It's as good a guess as anybody's, so I don't fault them for the direction they chose.  However, I don't buy it because if it went the direction they chose, the mystery would probably have been solved by now.
However, the movie does have more going for it, although it is far from a great one.  A lot of effort was made to give the viewer a feel of what it was like to live in those times.  The filthy living conditions of all but the wealthy are covered, although I suspect they were in reality a lot harsher.  The plight of hookers at the time (and yes, the term existed then), is covered, even though you have Heather Graham looking much too gorgeous.  You see that opium use was practiced, but on the other hand, Johnny Depp is so stoned throughout it, you wonder how he gets any work done.  And they cover how anti-Semitism played a big role in the paranoia about the killer.

1440870,4,B00005JKJM,"This film just misses being a classic.  The effects are fabulous so if effects were all, it would have made it.  And Johnny Depp does his usual first class acting job.  Some are complaining that his accent wasn't authentic but I could hear and understand every word he said which I probably couldn't have if he'd used a genuine Cockney accent.  I think the factor that causes this film to just miss classic status is that the villain is just too far over the top.  This weird thing they do to his eyes, for one, is way too offputting.  I imagine special lenses were inserted into his eyes for this effect.  It is the one effect I could have done without.  This is the story of a detective (Depp) on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he murders prostitutes in Victorian England with Jack being the villain of the piece.  Heather Graham does a nice job playing one of the prostitutes.

1440871,2,B00005JKJM,"One can't help but notice a pattern in films in which Johnny Depp is cast.  He's become known for his roles in dark, quirky, eccentric films, in which he plays dark, quirky, eccentric characters.
If you were less than thrilled by any of the other recent films in which Depp has played, you probably won't feel any different about this one. In this film, he plays an opium addicted detective on the trail of the famous London killer.  His opium habbit induces visions which bring him ever closr to the killer. (Ooooh! Wieeerd!!!)
Heather Graham plays (surprise!) a hooker with a heart of Gold who becomes a sort of love interest for Depp.  As for the killer's identitiy, the film takes a conspiracy theorists point of view.  I won't spoil it,  but let's just say that its not an unfamiliar scenario, as it involves  big wigs who are killing hookers to keep them quiet about a ""dark secret.""
What's puzzling is the fact that real Brittish actors went along with this film, which is an exercise in ""Britain Bashing.""  The hookers are portrayed not just as victims of a crazed killer, but of a patriarchal, racist, and anti- semitic culture.  You can almost hear someone screaming out loud, ""Damn those brits to hell!""
At any rate,  this is one most people can easily make up their minds about. One need only consider their opinion of Graham and Depp. If you loved 'em in those other flicks, then you'll love 'em in this one too.  The reverse is also true, but that goes without saying.",1025481600,,1482,4.579545454545454
1440872,2,B00005JKJM,"I'll be the first to admit that making a movie about Jack the Ripper would be a daunting task. Theories on the identity of who he (or she) actually was range from a complete unknown killer, to a woman, to the royal conspiracy theory, and everything in-between. But this adaptation falls miserably short of exploring any of this and instead concentrates on the royal conspiracy idea. I wasn't expecting a documentary. However, there were over twenty viable suspects in the case and this movie focuses on one idea and would have us to believe it to be written in stone (not even a trailer at the end indicating that it is one of many solutions).
From Hell, the movie, is based on the book of the same name, which is based on the Stephen Knight's `JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION'. It is a fascinating theory but has little merit as far as being factual. For example: contrary to the movie, grape stems were only found at one murder scene (days later, probably not connected to the crime), the victims are portrayed as being friends (there is no evidence that they even knew each other), Abberline was not a drug addict, nor did he die soon after the murders. There are many other `errors', which I won't elaborate on, but is sufficient to say that this is not an accurate portrayal of actual events.
Enough of the history, on to the movie itself. I have one good thing to say about the movie; the sets for eighteenth century London are very good. Okay, I said ONE good thing. Now the bad. If impersonating directors were a crime, the Hughes brothers would be put away for life. The directing, casting, and editing in this film are awful. It is about two hours long, probably should be closer to three to get every thing in. In fact, the editing makes it feel like a three-hour film with an hour's worth of footage arbitrarily cut out. They do a poor job of introducing the characters and the acting is sub par. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp, but he stumbles through this as if he were actually smoking the opium of his character. Heather Graham as a prostitute is not far fetched :) but in every scene she looks as if she has just had a luxurious bath, picked up her laundry from the cleaners, and maybe had a manicure. Hello! she is a `whore' in 1888 London. How can you spend so much time/money/effort on the details of the set and miss the obvious things.
In my opinion, the motivation of this film is basically to make a movie, loosely base the storyline on a popular subject, throw in a couple of well known actors, sell it and make some money.  If you want a fictional thriller, watch something where the production company doesn't have to pretend to base events on fact. If you're interested in the real facts of the case, read  Sugden's 'Complete History of Jack the Ripper' or Rumbelow's 'The Complete Jack the Ripper'. If you're looking for a really good Jack the Ripper movie, sorry, it hasn't been made yet.",1025395200,5,2916,4.4793233082706765

I was so enrossed in this film., I missed making popcorn or eating any lunch.  The scenes in White Chapel took care of my appetite.
One thing that impressed me about this movie is that it was so accurate right down to the cockney accent of the street walkers.  Most of the movies based on this character were white washed in some way.  More than just the real ""Jack the Ripper"" was missing.
I only recommend this movie to people with strong stomachs.",1025395200,,618,4.385964912280702

He had a good guess in real life, but never spoke to the actual Ripper.
The detail of the city for the White Chapel Murders is great, and you would think there were actually there, even though it is just a movie set.

from going to find her, in order to let her hide in there safely,but he couldn't forget her, so he
resorted to Opium to make himself able to see visions of Mary, but it finally led to his own death, it's a really
heart-wrecking ending, so sad that two lovers couldn't
be together, one suffered and sacrificed his own happiness
to protect the other's life. So touching and definitely tell audiences the depth of their love .

1440916,3,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is the latest movie released depicting the tragic true life tale of one of the most regonized serial killers of all time, Jack the Ripper, who in the late 1800s terrorized London by murdering women prostitutes.  I hadn't known much about the Jack the Ripper tale until lately, but I've always heard his name.  People worldwide know who you're talking about whenever his name is mentioned.  Recently, I caught several History Channel shows regarding the true life tale, and it provided me with many great facts.  From Hell is definitely entertaining, and stays true to some of the truth such as death scenes, etc, but accuracy isn't one of the strongest traits in this film.
It's obvious that this film is going for mainly entertainment.  And it works.  The characters are likeable, and the mood and atmosphere is definitely creepy.  However, it isn't completely accurate.  Instead of staying true to all of the facts, the movie provides some alternative solutions to some of the real life mysteries.  In real life, the identity of the killer was never found, however, the movie provides you with a definite conclusion.  While it isn't completely accurate, it's still enjoyable to see the alternative situations and how it 'might' have been since nothing is truly definite in the real-life tale.
The DVD also has many great extras.  It's a 2-Disc set, so if you really enjoyed the movie, you're sure to enjoy the extras contained within the disc.  There are commentaries, deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes, etc.  It's worth a look, in my opinion.",1025222400,6,1559,4.95
1440917,4,B00005JKJM,"As a motion picture, From Hell is quite good.  Just don't look for any truths about Jack the Ripper to emerge from the movie.  While it is based on the Whitechapel murders and does an adequate job presenting some factual information (such as the locations and conditions of the bodies), the premise is based on a thoroughly discredited and rather laughable theory; there is also much fiction in the relationships of the murder victims, and many important events and individuals are ignored altogether.  The film does a decent job of depicting Whitechapel, but it never really comes close to portraying the true filth and miserable conditions of the real Whitechapel, nor does it succeed in revealing the humanity of the unfortunate victims.  Certainly one pities the poor women who must engage in prostitution merely to survive, but the utter hopelessness and darkness of their world does not really manifest itself in the movie.  The portrayals of the murders themselves are quite good and were clearly done with an eye toward accuracy.  I was glad to see that no real attempt was made to show the true state of the final victim's body because nothing can possibly convey the utter horror of that scene.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as Inspector Abberline; Heather Graham is a wonderful Mary Kelly, but her character never really came across as a down and out prostitute.  The characters involved in the murders and conspiracy, whom I will not name for fear of giving something away, are also quite good.  I can accept and even applaud the ""solution"" this movie portrays, as there are a couple of really ingenious aspects of the whole conspiracy, and I felt the ending was quite proper and touchingly subtle.  Needless to say, this is a rather depressing story all the way around.  There is not an overabundance of horror, as the real dirty work of the Ripper is never shown to the audience, so the squeamish can probably make it through until the end with a minimum of head turns.
As an armchair Ripperologist, I am compelled to state that the identify of the Ripper and the complex story surrounding the ""solution"" here are not at all historical.  The movie makers took as their premise a thoroughly discredited story, and on top of this they added several completely original ideas.  For example, Inspector Abberline is here portrayed as an opium addict who has visions of the Ripper murders.  The victims supposedly know each other and are marked out for death for a quite specific reason.  All of the juiciest Ripper gossip and wildest speculations are injected into this movie.  For those with little knowledge of the Whitechapel murders, please understand that the murderer, whoever he was, was certainly not the culprit named in this movie.  If you want to learn the history of these crimes, forget almost everything you see here.  This movie is to be enjoyed as a dark, Gothic motion picture because that is all it is.
I must say I was disappointed by the bonus material on the accompanying disc.  The documentary about Jack the Ripper is the worst such documentary I have ever seen.  On the one hand, you have someone pointing an amateur camera over Donald Rumbelow's shoulder--often losing the focus as the camera zooms in and out--as he flips through pages of a book of Ripper-related drawings--the most exciting part of this segment is the moment when Rumbelow announces he has to cough and then does so.  On the other hand, you have a fairly old interview of less than stellar quality with a man who asserts that the true facts are those that we see presented in the movie, which is simply untrue and has no evidence upon which to stand.  I was most disappointed by the tour of the murder sites.  Some of the actual murder locations still exist today, and there is in fact a tour offered of the murder sites in modern Whitechapel, but the ""tour"" on the DVD turns out to be a tour of the movie set; the tour guides are the two directors, who make a big joke out of the whole tour and murders.  The deleted scenes are interesting, especially the alternate ending, but I rejoice that such scenes were all deleted because they would have potentially ruined the movie, in my opinion.  Finally, there is an inane 9-minute documentary about absinthe--while Depp's Abberline consumed this dangerous drink as an aid for his visionary powers, absinthe has less than nothing to do with Jack the Ripper.  I'm still giving this DVD four stars because I enjoyed the highly fictionalized movie, but the accompanying DVD really detracts from the overall package.",1025136000,3,4558,4.789272030651341

Aside from this film being superficial and down right boring, (with American actors playing UK) do view the Hughes Brothers flippancy in the documentaries, as they stroll down the lane where they joke about John Merrik (the elephant man) being the killer with his withered hand, or the fake bodies strewn across the sets. I wouldn't have been so appalled by this...if his film hadn't been as witless, pointless and thoroughly demeaning as it was. The best I can say about the ""creative geniuses"" is their DP did a good job.

1440919,5,B00005JKJM,"When one looks at the body of Depp's work, you cannot fail but be impressed with us superior acting talent.
In this basically accurate adaptation, he play the famous Instpector Fred Abberlane, heading the investigation of Jack the  Ripper.  It is very astmospheric, very grim (maybe a little too much for some), providing an excellent backdrop for Depp's talents.  Abberlane, in this version, is not a drunkard, but drug addict.  His character has also been merged with that of Lees the psychic who provided leads in the Ripper case, so now Abberlane has the visions of the ripper's work.
There is really nothing new to the storyline - the question of Annie Crook's child, the Prince Edward Albert's involvement with her, and that Jack the Ripper was really a myth to cover up a threat to the morarchy has been brought up in many books, and in the superior MURDER BY DECREE film starring Christopher Plummer, as was The Masonic ritual, the fact nearly all the power people, like Sir Charles Warren, were all Freemasons, the suspicious of Gull being the ripper so there is really nothing new.

As for the movie itself, the sets are incredibly accurate. But some of the acting by Heather Graham and Johnny Depp detracts from the wonderful surroundings. I don't know if they needed better speech coaches or different actors, but the first part of the movie I had to try and overlook their poor English accents. Some aspects of the story are far fetched even for Jack the Ripper. While portayals of Inspector Frederick Abberline have shown him to be either a drunk or opium addict, this movie shows him having ""visions"" that help him solve cases. Ummm, ok.

Melodramatic and clich-ridden: swirling fog ... shadow of top-hatted figure .... carrying obligatory surgeon's bag ... over-acting street women and pimps (O so evil!) in pubs. Really gives it no sense or atmosphere of the period: this was a time when the class barrier would not have permitted the ""ill-spoken"" members of the police the social freedom to come and go that this movie allows them. The plot is a re-hash of previous movies on the Ripper, featuring Masons whose members reach to almost the highest echelons in the land, the Duke of Clarence (no, he is NOT the Ripper this time, but his naughtiness is the cause of all the bother). We come upon a bemused Johnny Depp in an opium den at the start of the movie, and he remains pretty bemused throughout, with sudden disconcerting bursts of activity; stimulated, we are expected to believe, by the incredible insight he draws from his opiated stupors. Poor Robbie Coltrane (and we know what he can do as ""Cracker""), looks lost with the awful script he's given and is wasted here. The use of four letter words and quaint monikers for rude body-parts is overdone, seemingly with a good deal of self-conscious gloating (See? They used the same rude words we do today!).

1440923,2,B00005JKJM,"Considering all the good things about this film, it really should have been better than it is. The actors and performances are first rate (Johnny Depp has never been better, Ian Holm is wonderful, Robbie Coltrane too, and so is everyone else), the sets are first rate, the music is ok, but somehow it ends up being less than the sum of its parts.
For me, it was just too disturbing. The Hughes brothers went for cheap ugly shocks instead of something else ... but I don't know what that something else is. One thing that bothered me was the paranoid conspiracy of Queen Victoria (a little hard to believe) being directly involved with, and knowledgeable about, the MD who was doing the killing. Message: don't trust the monarchy. This is ok with me, but for this reason, it is a little over the top. The other thing was the Masons (which is very hard to believe). Message: don't trust the upper classes. This is ok with me too, but the way this was done is just, I'm sorry but I have to say this, silly. (I am NOT a Mason.)
So, in the end, it is the ""Holywood"" liberals insulting the audience with unbelievable and silly conspiracy theories. Along with ugly and cheap violence. There is very little, if anything, morally uplifting about this film, except maybe for Robbie Coltrane's character.
The extra features are good on the collectors CD, except the Hughes brothers are not very articulate in their commentary. So, for me, the weak part of this film is the Hughes brothers. Sorry about that.",1024185600,2,1496,4.585820895522388
1440924,1,B00005JKJM,"Kind of a mixed-up version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, wherein Johnny Depp smokes drugs and somebody else commits a crime.
The opening scene gives you a pretty good idea of the sort of movie this is going to be:  panning into a computer generated London abyss, we see varied scenes of filth and degradation, including a cameo by the elephant man.  I guess he was just happening by or somink.  Which brings us to the subject of Johnny Depp's accent.
While living in Japan I was once informed that a certain other gaijin male was a kind of laughing stock among the Japanese:  though he had learnt to speak fluent Japanese, he had apparently learnt from a woman and so he spoke fluent FEMALE Japanese.  Well, the same thing seems to have happened to Johnny Depp.
As to Heather Graham's accent, if I were the directors I would have taken a whip to her:  flogged her mercilessly.  Also, I would have insisted that she prepare for her role as a low-grade prostitute by working as a prostitute for some time.
But anyway, so Johnny Depp smokes stuff and somebody else knifes a prostitute in a dark alley.  They roust him out of the opium den in which he is languishing and take him by the scruff of the neck to get a load of a body in the morgue.  HE mumbles words to the effect that yeah, that was the broad he seen in his revery and it becomes clear that being bombed on opium is Inspector Depp's way of solving crimes.
The best thing to do, if you are compelled to rent - I mean buy, yes, buy - the film is to freeze-frame it on a shot of Big Ben that comes on about 40 minutes into the picture.

1440946,5,B00005JKJM,"The first time I learned of the ""true"" identity of Jack the Ripper was from a book by Steven Knight, who I feel is the closest and most viable resource for this elusive killer's identity and facts surrounding the case. The movie adheres to much of Knight's solution and tells the tale in a dark, appropriately frightening fashion. Depp is, as usual, up to the task of portraying Frederick Abberline, lead detective on the case, and one of the few voices of reason (albeit through a haze of either drink or drugs) throughout this melange of criminals, both low and high estate, all the way to Buckingham Palace, who orchestrated this serial killing to maintain the Monarchy and keep it intact for the sake of England, ostensibly. I was not surprised to see that, at the end of the movie, Victoria feels gratitude that ""we"" have been saved, and not to make any further references to this episode...""we"" are most grateful for your discretion in this matter. The implication of the Duke of Clarence, and what happened to his poor wife and child, is well-documented here, and when taken in context of the story and research that went into this production, one feels convinced that indeed, this is what happened and why. Ian Holm is wonderful in his role of Sir Wm. Gull, physician to the Queen, and the architect of the plan which she was entirely aware of from the ineception of same, and bore out my own feelings with respect to how much she played a part in these killings. Great atmosphere and really presents a window into Vicotrian London and the plight of the East End, and the tragic lives these women led, all very well-represented here. ""We"" were eminently entertained and thought the movie was well-directed and very well acted. If you are a Ripperologist, or merely curious, see this one...",1023667200,3,1797,4.707936507936508
1440947,4,B00005JKJM,"This movie has great acting and the directors created an atmosphere to match the mood perfectly.
Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick Abberline. He is an intelligent, drug addicted man who is depressed by a tragedy from his past and has burried himself in his work. He is extremely persistent in his job, but when it comes to Mary, one of the women Jack the Ripper is after, he is very sweet, caring, and determined to take care of her. Johnny Depp portrays this mix of emotions and characteristics brilliantly.
The best part about Johnny Depp is that in each movie he is in, he actually seems to become the character he is playing. There is no connection to any other parts he has played because in each movie, he can change his appearance, voice, personality, or whatever else is needed for him to become that person. As I watched From Hell, I wasn't thinking 'There's Ichabod Crane(Sleepy Hallow) or Gilbert Grape(What's Eating Gilbert Grape). He is always recognizable, but always completly different.
This movie is definetly worth seeing.  However, if you haven't seen it, you might want to rent it before you buy it.  Personally, this isn't the kind of movie I would choose to watch over and over.",1023321600,2,1204,4.755980861244019
1440948,3,B00005JKJM,"I was very interested in seeing this movie. I love this kind of history and it just looked very intriguing. Of course, you can't really watch this film as a complete history lesson. I'll explain later. The movie tells the story about Jack The Ripper, a name given to a serial killer who brutally slaughtered five prostitutes(could be more)nearly 114 years ago in London. Nobody knew who this man was. They still don't. In comes Johnny Depp, who plays a Scotland Yard inspector named Abberline. This is a man with his own problems. He is addicted to opium, and this addiction seems to help him solve murders by having visions of the crimes. He befriends prostitute Mary Kelly(who, in real life, was a victim)played by Heather Graham, who is part of the circle of prostitutes being killed. Isn't it funny how all of her fellow prostitutes are on the unattractive side but she is pretty?. Robbie Coltrane(""Harry Potter"", ""Nuns On The Run"")is on hand as Depp's sgt. The cast also includes Ian Holm, who you may remember from such films as ""Alien"" and ""The Fifth Element"". He plays a doctor who no longer practices because of an ailment. The Hughes Brothers(Allen and Albert), direct this film with a sure hand. It is exquisitley shot and looks great. There are a number of scenes that are filled with haunting visuals. The town and costumes are great. Beautiful. The acting is pretty solid. Heather Graham is a decent actress, but she hasn't been given any good stuff since ""Boogie Nights"". She is passable here, but there isn't a whole lot to her. Ian Holm steals the show with his ill doctor character. Robbie Coltrane is always watchable. Johnny Depp is pretty good. There is no doubt that he is one of the best actors of his generation, but his performance here is kinda routine. Not that it's bad. Some people say he's just like Ichabod Crane in ""Sleepy Hollow"" again. No way. These two movies and characters are as different as night and day. His accent is pretty good too. The ending of this film tells you who the ripper is. But don't think that you were actually given a positive answer to this mystery. You aren't. The fact is that nobody really knows who Jack The Ripper was. This crime has gone unsolved for over a 100 years. There have been theories and thoughts since then, but no real proof. He could've been caught, but he could also of gotten away. No one knows who he really was or what happened to him and probably never will. The filmmakers here pretty much took one theory and used it. But there can be no satisfactory ending here. I suggest you read some books on this subject or check out some web sites on who some of the alleged suspects were. It is a fascinating mystery made into a decent, but still somewhat unsatisfying, film. It is very violent and may not be of your liking. I enjoyed it well enough. It could of been better.",1023235200,15,2852,4.56140350877193
1440949,3,B00005JKJM,"The bloody terror of Jack the Ripper soaks almost every frame of ""FROM HELL."" Although twin directors Allen and Albert Hughes deliver a detailed and atmospheric recreation of London's East End Whitechapel district circa 1888, they do not quite capture the full impact of the massive graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell on which the film is based.  Johnny Depp is a Scotland Yard detective who uses all manner of drugs to enhance his intuitive ""visions"" as he investigates the surgical-like slayings of five prostitutes.  Robbie Coltrane is his assistant. Heather Graham's a Cockney whore who may become a victim of the Riper and Ian Holm is a still proud, but washed-up surgeon.  The real star of this grimly gripping saga is the recreation of London's Ripper haunts in Prague.  The two disc set is heavy with extras and bonus material including commentary by directors, writer, cinematographer, many deleted scenes, an alternate ending, multiple featurettes include making-of, behind the scenes, and a tour of the actual Ripper murder sites with the Hughes brothers. ""From Hell"" makes a strong case for the identity of the Ripper as an heir to the British throne but it is at odds with the recent and equally compelling conclusions by crimewriter Patricia Cornwell.  Whoever the Ripper was, he was never brought to justice while he was alive.",1023235200,2,1354,5.026785714285714

For instance, in the movie you saw who the killer was and in reality we have a vage idea of who it was. Also, when they suggested why he killed those girls and that the police were wrong about Mary Kelly's death. Even with all of that I still like the movie. One thing I did like was that the film makers followed the story very well and that most of the things in the movie did look real. Most of the actors did pull off a good preformance but there are still some things in the movie I wished the film makers haden't done, like what happens to Johnny Depp's character. Another thing I didn't like or understood why it was included in the film was the scene when they had the Elephant Man (Joseph Merick) in the room when Depp was just there to find the doctor. But deep within me I have to say the movie was not that bad. I rather liked it and would see it again if the chance came up.",1022976000,2,1049,4.072463768115942

1440953,5,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is a stylistic trip into the different levels of lifestyle's in the grime of Englands past. Based on entirely true events envolving the notorious Jack the Ripper, From Hell submerges the audience into the muck and grissly sights surrounding the murders of five ""unfortunates"".
Johnny Depp plays an inspector that is given charge to capture Jack the Ripper. He has a special gift, the ability to forsee the murders. Unfortunately, this is while he dances with the ""Dragon"", a drug of Absinth, Poison and Sugar cubes. Heather Graham, in the performance of her life up to this point, is an ""unfortunate"" on the Ripper's list. Does she survive?
I couldn't believe this disc. Its practically perfect. It stands near ""Se7en"" as far as quality goes. The Reds are stark and the darks merge with the black bars most will see on the top and bottom of your screen. Sometimes, its so dark, that these bars disappear. The yellows are what I agree (with a friend of mine) to be sickeningly yellow. Really well done and the extra's are everything informative you'd want to know about Jack the Ripper. Considering that not much is known in the first place, I would say there couldn't be a better set included.
One nice touch that I liked, for you people with strong stomachs, was the flies buzzing around my speakers. I was actually swatting by my ear before I realized what was going on.

1440995,2,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is not really even worth the time or space provided writing this review.  Everything that I have heard good about this movie is totally and completely wrong.
First off, I do not know the background on the Jack the Ripper story, so I can't comment on the factual side of the movie.  But everything else I can.
First, the acting.  Johnny Depp lately seems to be playing the same roles over and over again.  He looks, acts, and talks exactly the same in every movie, such as Sleepy Hollow, The Ninth Gate, and finally this one.  He really isn't that great of an actor, and I don't think he can really carry a movie by himself.  Dating back to the train wreck The Astronauts Wife, he hasn't been in a good movie.  Heather Graham I am no fan.  She may look good, but I don't really care for her.
I might have likened the characters more if the directing was done well enough.  But, it wasn't.  There were times when the film jumped around so much that I had no idea what was going on.  Maybe I'm just that dumb, but I needed some explanations.  I did not see anything worth talking about with the cinematography either.  It all looked pretty bland to me.
Why did I give this movie 2 stars?  Well, when I can sit through 2 hours of hell and still want to know whodunit, then something must have worked.  What that something was, I have no idea.  2 Stars",1022544000,5,1357,4.262745098039216
1440996,3,B00005JKJM,"Since childhood, I have been fascinated by Jack the Ripper, probably the first serial killer who shamelessly courted the media and was never caught, a legend in his own time. There have been innumerable books, films, tv shows, plays, and a full-length illustrated book based on the exploits of ""Bloody Jack"". The illustrated book was entitled ""From Hell"", on which this film is based. ""From Hell"" to me is disappointing fare. It's certainly not bad, but it's not very satisfying, either. Which is a shame, because there are many good elements in it. The atmosphere of 1880s London, particularly the seedy Whitechapel district in which the murders took place, has been evocatively recreated. The Hughes brothers took great pains to recreate the murder sites in uncanny detail. Also, little tidbits like paying a small fee to sleep on a rope in a flophouse (several people would lean on a rope and sleep, being too poor to even afford a bed for a night)add to the film's gritty atmosphere. However, the film suffers from too many arty flourishes and heavy-handed attempts at social commentary that diminish the film's power. Yes, there was class, race and religious discrimination in Victorian London, but these subjects are perfunctorily referred to in the film, and then swallowed up by the ""slice and dice"" activities. Inspector Abberline's opium-induced visions of the murders are filmed in a blaring music video fashion that remind the viewer that he is ""watching a movie"", undermining whatever tension and emotional identification one might have with the subject matter. The sequences with ""The Elephant Man"" do not add to the film, either. He's brought in as a colorful curiosity, then disappears just as abruptly, so one wonders, ""Why did they bother?"" A lot of the facts have been inextricably been mixed up with a lot of preposterous rehashed theories, such as the identity of the Ripper (The film draws largely from the 1988 made-for-tv miniseries with Michael Caine), and the ludicrous theory of the Ripper being driven around in an ominous horsedrawn black coach never held much water (or blood)for me. There were never any reports or even suspicions of said coach-this is purely amateur sleuth conjecture. Conspiracy theories abound in this film, a viewpoint that, in my opinion, has worn out its welcome. Why are so many people surprised that the Jack the Ripper was never caught? A lot of murderers are never caught, nor do they have lofty motives-they are simply bloodthirsty! The performances are, for the most part, unremarkable. Johnny Depp is good as the opium-dabbling Inspector Abberline, though the character has been fictionalized to the point of unrecognizability. Depp also looks somewhat out of place historically, along with Heather Graham-they look like escapees from a Kenneth Cole ad. The supporting players look pretty convincing in their Victorian clothes and hairstyles, but Mr. Depp looks like a member of a grunge band, and Ms. Graham, with her Jessica Rabbit hairdo and flawless ivory skin, looks too contemporary and clean-she doesn't even have a symbolic smudge of dirt on her cheek! The other performers, including Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, Queen Victoria's physician, are good, but this isn't a film about characterizations-the roles are pretty much two-dimensional Victorian paper dolls. I think what ultimately disappointed me was the film's viewpoint. It couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be an out and out shocker, or a piece of social commentary, rendering it centerless and ultimately unsatisfying.
The picture quality and color are beautiful and vivid on this DVD, and the sound is top-notch. The musical score is of the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" variety, with those annoying deafening ""door-slamming"" sounds whenever a victim or potential victim is accosted-a musical cliche that gets on my nerves. The extra features on the 2nd disc are a mixed bag of tricks, but the feature on Absinthe, that popular 19th Century semi-narcotic drink is interesting, and the documentary featuring Ripper maven Donald Rumbelow makes for interesting watching. ""From Hell"" is a fairly entertaining but empty and forgettable 2 hours, a film that should have had a policeman on hand to see that it didn't stray from its duties.",1022544000,4,4280,5.115714285714286

My expectations concerning this movie were not great, mostly I feared that Johnny Depp would play another character more or less identical to the bookish, curious self-absorbed loner he played in the Ninth Gate and Sleepy Hollow.  I guess the inspector he plays is similar, but the Hughes Brothers know how to make a movie.  Better than Menace to Society, I was enraptured throughout by the mood of dread and mystery.  It was a neat detective story that managed to avoid cliches associated with the genre (a credit to the Hughes brothers).

1441001,3,B00005JKJM,"Probably one of the best commentary jobs I've ever seen (and heard) was Mel Gibson's commentary on Braveheart. Well done and informative, Mel remained silent for minutes at a time, letting the film tell the story. When he spoke, his comments were apposite, brief, and goodhumored. He singled out other actors , the director and photographer for praise, and he worked in many facts regarding the making of the film, or the historical background of the props used, and their authenticity (or lack thereof).

In contrast, the Hughes Brothers' commentary is selfindulgent, obscenity-laced, boring , and largely pointless. They talked over all but about a dozen lines, and were still rambling on after the end credits were running. Most of their comments relied heavily on the word ""I"" . Few of their remarks shed any light on the things one would most have liked to learn more about :  The viewer sees terrible, horrifying images on the screen, and we hear the Hughes Brothers ramble on with verbiage totally unrelated to the horrific imagery : ""I loved Europe ; I hate Hollywood;  I-I-I-I-I-I-"". To the viewer, the story is what matters ; to these two, it's all about them.  It might  have been much better to have Moore, Gibbon, and Yglesias comparing their treatment of plot twists, as opposed to hearing the Hughes Brothers express their  oh-so-fascinating and trendy disdain for Hollywood accounting people.

By the way : Don't take at face value the one commentator's ""history"" of the Masons, which relies on urban legends, myths , and outright falsehoods. The Masons cannot be traced back ""thousands of years"", and anyone who thinks that only the masons had architectural skills through those long centuries is displaying woeful ignorance of the architectural skill of the Greeks , Romans, the Chinese, the Indians, the mesoAmericans....

Disc Two is a little better. To one who is not familiar with the Jack the Ripper case, the study of what facts are known in this case will be useful. To 'ripperologists', it's all pretty familiar territory.

As for the film itself, it is good as a whodunnit, though hardly as history. It manages to make even squalor look picturesque. I give the film 3 stars, but the graphic novel 5,and I recommend the book to anyone who enjoyed the film.",1022371200,3,2283,4.896373056994818
1441002,3,B00005JKJM,"For ""Ripper"" enthusiasts this story will never be good, but for people who don't know the ""Ripper"" tale very well it will be. The fact that we find out who the ripper is will be enough for ripper fans to hate this film. The real ""Jack the Ripper"" was never caught, and that is one of the reasons his story endures.
This movie reminded me of the movie ""Tombstone"" with Kurt Russell, or ""Braveheart"" with Mel Gibson, where history had to give way to the drama. There were bits and pieces of history interwoven into the story, but in most of it creative license was taken for a more dramatic effect. We have the same thing in ""From Hell"".
The writer(s) pretty much took every theory about the Whitechapel murders and threaded them into the story, giving people a great number of suspects to be suspicious of, and keeping us on our toes until we finally know who the sicko is.
The movie is well acted and well shot. The Hughes brothers take their urban style background with movies like ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"" and apply it well to turn-of-the-century England in one of the worst areas of London, probably a worse hell-hole than present-day South Central Los Angeles. It works well.
Those of you who know the ripper story won't find much tension here, as the movie does historically conform to the order of the killings, so when you see Polly Nichols walk past the ""Buck's Row"" sign you know what's about to happen. But any audience of a thriller like this, where a woman is walking alone at night, should be expecting the same thing.
As someone who knows the story this movie didn't scare me at all, but it was very entertaining. Johnny Depp did his job well, as did Heather Graham and the rest of the cast. I recommend this film to those of you who aren't familiar with the facts surrounding the Whitechapel murders.

From Hell is about Depps drug addiction and his love for a hooker.  Both the Characters and the plot are thin as paper.  Small bits of info are given throughout the movie leading to nothing.

1441034,5,B00005JKJM,"A previous review groused about the unlikeliness of Stephen Knights' Final Solution as a plot element. Yes the Final Solution does strain crediblity, especially when you consider Gull (Holm's Character) was well into his seventies, but the Hughes addressed this with element of insanity. This film features the most authentic recreation of the Whitechapel Murderers handiwork ever committed to the big screen. The European setting, the custom built Whitechapel set, the excellent casting, acting, sound, and layering of content make this more than a competant effort. What did the Hughes Brothers in a the box office was an even more horrendous event than Whitechapel, September 11. The timing of releasing a darkly toned, foriegn set, period peice police procedural could not have been worse. Plus, when you consider the target audience being educated, mostly male (sorry, ladies), crime buffs, it is a wonder that it was #1 for a week.
The Brothers are making an audacious statement here about The Man, and being a egalitarian caucasian, myself, I agree. At the time of the actual murders, the conditions in Whitechapel were an example of how ineptly western society dealt with its foriegner/poor. The implication of the Royal Order of Freemasons only serves to highlight the dichotomy in caste between the wealthy and the down-trodden, especially in the light of what the elite will do to maintain thier status. The verismilitude of the production make it knife sharp in its attempt to portray a type of society that existed then in Great Britain, and that still exists in the World now on a grander scale. Johnny Depp follows up in a perfect way from his Sleepy Hollow mold. The only two points of contention that I have are minor. The contacts were too large on Holm and looked a tad silly, rather that menacing. When the bed in Kelleys room was moved for the final(?) murder, it took away from an important identification that Ripperologist needed from this film. That is, the imfamous Kelley Crime Scene photograph being one of first, and still on of the most appalling visions ever beheld, was denied its truth and effect here, and no matter how much the director desired to throw a door-way shadow across the bed, the horror of the Kelly Murder over shadows the entire case, and deserved a movie in itself.

The Ripper was most likely a Nobleman and this flick tells the tale well. And with style. Bravo Hughes Brothers!
A common factor I did notice with people who said they didn't like it, is that they all probably watched it on 27"" TV's. I think it was watchable in widescreen only, which, on a 27"", turns into a 6-inch thick, 2-foot wide movie bar.",1022198400,,674,4.357142857142857

Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Abberline, a London detective whose Opium and Absinthe fueled dreams give him clues to the identity of the brutal killer of prostitutes in the slums of Whitechapel.  But as starts to discover, there are secrets that link these murders together and a conspiracy that goes to the highest levels of power in England.  The performances are solid, including Ian Holm as the Queen's chief surgeon (who has a few secrets of his own), Robbie Coltrane as the Inspector's reluctant partner, and Heather Graham as a prostitute who starts a dangerous relationship with Abberline.  The film was directed by the Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen (who directed more 20th century oriented fare such as ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"") and based upon the complex and grpahic comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  Thanks to cinematographer Peter Deming (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway) and the stunning production design, this movie makes 19th century London seem as dark and as creepy as the comic does.  While the film doesn't adhear too closely to the book, the graphic detail of the murders and the rather unusual conspiracy angle make this movie a must-see for horror buffs.  The DVD (a two-disc set to be replaced by a single disc by the end of the year) is definitely a must-own for fans of the film.  The lively commentary track feature the Hughes Brothers, Deming, Coltrane, and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias explaining not only the details of the film, but of the actual murders, theories, and some complaints about the studio system that make this an interesting listen.  One the first disc are nearly 20 deleted scenes and an alternate ending that is worth seeing with the optional commentary, if only to hear about an unusual extended shot that is worth questioning.  On disc two are some intersting documentaries on the production design, a humorous trip through the set with the Hughes Brothers, a look at the history of Absinthe, a look into the theories of Jack the Ripper's identity (everyone from the Queen's doctor to Lewis Carroll, writer of ""Alice in Wonderland"" are perceived to be suspects), and a look at the book as opposed to the film.  Rounding it off is the very short ""making of"" special aired on HBO, trailers, and look for a very special Easter Egg in the main menu.  All in all, this is definitely a most sinful treat and for those of you ""From Hell"" fans, this two-disc set is definitely worth the extra buck.",1022025600,,2760,4.7974683544303796
1441039,4,B00005JKJM,"""From Hell"" is another rendition of the famous story of ""Jack The Ripper"". This time it's stylishly directed by two brothers, the Hughes Brothers.  This is such a different work of film from their earlier efforts, ""Dead Presidents"" and ""Menace II Society"".
The story of Jack the ripper is an interesting one, and it is told very well here.  It is suspenseful, creepy, and gory. However, it is also an extremely well crafted work.  The acting and directing are outstanding. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are the only names here, but overall the acting is superb. This is a must see for all Depp fans. I think this is his second best work, his first being ""Blow"".
If you have never seen any films depicting Jack the Ripper, this would be a great choice for the first.  It is a creepy old tale and it's spun really well here.
Johnny Depp, plays the inspector who is trying to find out who is the ripper, and he turns in a magnificent performance here.
He also has a full grasp of the English accent, which I was very impressed with.  He is very underrated as an actor, and I think he is one of the best actors in films.
This is a great vehicle for him.

1441075,3,B00005JKJM,"FROM HELL [121 minutes / Rated R for string violence/gore, sexuality, language and drug content]
""From Hell"" is yet another movie about the famous serial killer, Jack the Ripper, who terrorized the streets of London over a hundred years ago. What makes the case so fascinating is that the murderer was never caught. Many theories have been put forth as to who the perpetrator was. This film presents its own ideas. They're truly far-fetched, but a stellar performance by Johnny Depp as an inspector assigned to the case, as well as a great set design that captures the London of the time, help to make this a superior version of the gruesome story.
Depp's Fred Abberline is an opium-smoking eccentric who has case-solving visions when he is high. This bizarre ability is what keeps him on the police force. Jack the Ripper's targets are street prostitutes. Fred meets and falls in love with one of them, the beautiful Mary Kelly [Heather Graham]. He learns that she and her friends have information that could bring great scandal to some of England's most important people. Could it be information worth killing for?
The movie was directed by the Hughes brothers, and it's quite a departure from their previous efforts like ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"". They handle the chills, the thrills and the atmosphere fairly well, although it times it's awkwardly obvious that two very American brothers are directing a very English tale. One of its assets, in my opinion, is that it's not specifically aimed at teens. It's adult enough for someone over twenty-one to enjoy as well. If, that is, your tastes run to decidedly gory stories.",1021680000,2,1642,4.910071942446043

The one draw back of the film is the female lead played by Heather Graham, a completely one-dimensional character.  If you are looking for a love story within this horrific theme you will be disappointed.  The sparks of lust fly but never ignite.

Obviously, we all thought this would be the be-all-end-all Ripper flick.  Alas, we have been let down again.  The physical characteristics of the film are stunning.  An unsurpassed attention to detail dominates this feast for the eyes, but its ... historical inaccuracies don't allow anyone who's truly familiar with the case to enjoy it; Lord forbid anyone new to the story should take this as gospel.  Please, if you are wanting to learn more about this mystery, do yourself a favor & get ""The Ultimate Jack The Ripper Companion"" here ....  For atmosphere alone, this is worth seeing!  The extras on the second disc are o.k. considering there's not much in-depth video material out on the Ripper case (one part however mismatches the body of one victim with the name of another; a ... oversight in editing!).  If this had been done from a more historical perspective, it WOULD have been the ultimate Ripper film & I guess for now, it has to do although I much prefer the Michael Caine TV miniseries from 1988.  If anyone knows where I can purchase that flick on VHS or preferably DVD....

1441079,4,B00005JKJM,"...To praise the Hughes Brothers for the atmosphere and blast Moore for the story is to entirely misunderstand what they took from the book. The atmosphere is a very well-done depiction of the atmosphere of the book. That part if the book inspired the Hughes Brothers, and they carried it through.
The plot is almost entirely the invention of the screenwriters hired to ""adapt"" Moore's book. To give an obvious example, Cordes faults Moore for Abberline's opium addiction, but the Abberline in the book -- a middle-aged, rather portly married man, like the historical personage -- was not addicted to opium, nor was he clairvoyant. These are all inventions of the movie.
You can hardly blame Moore for the Masonic/Royal conspiracy, which was featured in other movies and books before he wrote. He says himself in the appendix that he doesn't necessarily believe it to be the ""truth,"" but he used it because it made a good story, and it allowed him to say things about Victorian society, the nature of reality and illusion, Magic, Good and Evil, using the lens of the Jack the Ripper story. And his book is unlike any other Jack the Ripper tale. For one thing, it's not a ""whodunit"" thriller -- his Jack is revealed in Chapter Two of Fourteen.
Except for atmosphere, the only things the book and movie have in common is that Abberline is the primary detetective on the case (a ""fact"" about which there is some dispute, but he's one of two or three candidates for the position) and the identity of the killer.
Indeed, instead of crediting Alan Moore as the primary source, it might be more true to say that the Hughes Brothers main source of inspiration was Moore's partner, Eddie Campbell. They got the ""look"" right, but they changed almost everything else.
Still a good movie, though. Just not really a movie of the book.",1021248000,,1821,4.729559748427673
1441080,3,B00005JKJM,"Any movie based on Alan Moore's briliant graphic novel would be destined to fail in capturing all that is great about it, but The Hughes Brothers' ""From Hell"" seems to go out of its way to not even try. The best part of the book was that the reader knew from the first page who Jack the Ripper was and that most of the story was told from his point of view. The movie turned the story into a half-hearted whodunnit which really isn't much of a mystery after all, and the ending is an insult to history. The deleted scenes show how a lot of the cool stuff from Moore's book was shot but ultimately scrapped for reasons unknown. Still if you're a Jack the Ripper buff I would recommend owning it since there really aren't that many historically based Jack The Ripper movies. 20th Century Fox has been a few steps ahead of the other major studios in DVD presentation and this is no exception. It is one of the few two disc sets that have been produced lately that actually warrants being a 2 dis set. The menus are well made although the deleted scenes menus are harder to read than the end credits of Spawn. There is a so-called interactive documentary on Disc 2 which shows pictures and documents from the case. A magnifying glass icon pops up and then you can wacth clips from ""Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution."" This is sort of pointless interactivity, but it is nice to see ""jack The Ripper: The Final Solution"" on DVD. If you're a Jack The Ripper buff, buy the DVD. If you're looking for a Jack The Ripper murder mystery, watch David Wicke's Jack The Ripper with Michael Caine which is far superior to this.",1021161600,3,1613,4.38

Certainly, anyone who has seen this movie and enjoyed it and has not read the comic it is based on---definitely should. I loved the way that Moore and Campbell interwove so much fact with definite strands of fiction. This movie is an admirable attempt at relating their story in film.",1019865600,,596,4.632075471698113

There is some really good imagery filmed here as well that you may not expect had anyone else directed the film. To tell you the truth, I'm starting to get sick of Johnny Depp. His role in From Hell was too reminiscent to his role in Sleepy Hollow (which I also recommend).

Well! It was a Jack the Ripper movie!
Now, I used to be rather interested in that case as a lilGal, having read different accounts of the Whitechapel murders and seen a few Ripper movies. One criticism I do have to make is that as things were going along, I had a strange feeling of deja-vu: uh oh, wasn't this sort of lifted from ""Murder by Decree""? Yeah, it was, although no reviewer has commented on that yet. That was when Christopher Plummer's Sherlock Holmes had a go at it, with James Mason as Watson.
This time, a Holmes-like Cockney detective played by Johnny Depp is the master sleuth in charge of things. I liked his portrayal a lot. I also liked seeing old vet Ian Holm as a proper Victorian doctor whom Depp consults about certain ""technicalities"".
There was, however, a most improbable moment when Detective Depp brings the rather outlandishly dressed prostitute Heather Graham to the Royal Portrait Gallery or some such to make the equivalent of an ID from a mug shot, a full-length portrait of ""you know who"" if you have read enough about this case before. But wouldn't other people have been surprised to see this REALLY shockingly dressed trollop strolling around the museum? Maybe it's just me.
Still and all, I got my money's worth this time and enjoyed this version of the most famous unsolved murders of the 19th century.",1019433600,,1617,4.5793103448275865

Following a tangled web of gruesome murders and intrigue, Abberline and his batman George Godley track down the killer only to discover something more shocking than the killer.
A stylish period piece, similar in style to David Lean's ""Great Expectations"" and ""Oliver Twist,"" all capturing the true (seedy)nature of the most powerful city in the 19th century. Staring Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline,The film starts off well enough, unfortunately the romantic element Mary Kelly(featuring the fairly wooden Heather Graham) destroys what would have otherwise been an excellent thriller. The first hour is excellent, but a quick succession of murders has left the writers with little to play on other than intrigue and romance. Unfortunately they choose romance. This has had the terrible effect of mutilating the ending, leaving us with a rather short confrontation, that doesn't do justice to the ripper's prestige. Depp makes a delightful Abberline, immersing himself into the role, he makes a truly excellent Abberline. Graham, despite her beauty, is sorely lacking, her dull expression leads us to suggests she was not happy playing a victorian pinchprick. The strongest element in ""From Hell"" would be its supporting cast,  containing some of today's best British actors, (Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, Ian Richardson as Sir Charles Warren and Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant George Godley,) it adds another star to score.
The film is based on one of the most controversial (as less accepted) Ripper theories, made in Stephen Knight's ""JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION."" As a credible account, it lags severely behind the Francis Tumblety and James Maybrick cases, finding favor among the Conspiracy theorists, rather than historians. In reality Mary Kelly was murdered, and Abberline lived till he was 86. The Kelly/Abberline romance is unbelievable, and wastes valuable screen time which could have otherwise been spent on the confrontation.

Entertaining, thrilling and interesting. The acting is generally excellent, the sets are well designed and the characters are interesting.

If you do find the tale of the never-caught, premier serial killer still fascinating then this is your flick.  The Hughes Brothers have dusted off the old boy's story and done him up a treat!
Quite crazily fanatical in their devotion to detail, the Hughes Brothers have confessed to an enduring obsession about Red Jack.  I, rather shamefacedly, must admit the same.  There is something about the fog-shrouded lanes of Whitechapel, prowled by the diabolical and demonic murderer, dressed to the nines in formal cape & top hat (we imagine) with black surgeon's bag hiding the long slim razor sharp scalpels with which he does his horrid work, that is so chilling and creepy.  And  that he does his villainy on poor, broken-down prostitutes with such a ferocity,  that deep & dark motives must be at play here.  It is the fuel for both nightmares & movies.
Others must share this fascination, for we have had him as a fixture in our imagination from The Lodger on to dozens of film and television treatments and riffs on the theme, i.e., encounters with Sherlock Holmes etc.
Well, the Hughes's have done a job here, in some instances with absolute brilliance.  This is a dark and moody meditation on the Ripper, as stylish and delirious as Johnny Depp's Inspector Aberline's fever-dream hallucinations.  Beautifully shot and composed with clever uses of the camera and an evocation of those foggy streets, filled with terror and panic.
Certainly not for everyone.  This is a superbly crafted film of  an admittedly peculiar interest. Jack the Ripper has provided a Hannibal Lecter-like fascination for audiences for 100 years now.  The granddaddy of them all, Red Jack was the real deal, and the true fascination is in his unrevealed identity which leaves him open to any interpretation imagination can take us.  He is the monster half-hidden in our nightmares.",1015891200,13,1950,4.905487804878049

1441162,3,B00005JKJM,"As a big fan of the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, I already had a bone to pick with the movie. Most people will tell you that the movie is never as good as nor the same as the book, but I think that as with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" they can at least attempt to do it justice. I knew that the point of view and overall tone of the story had been changed from the beginning, and I knew that would be difficult for me to overcome, but I gave it the day in court anyway.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the first two thirds of the movie. While I found the opium smoking amalgamation of Johnny Depps character a lazy creation, I was able to overlook it due to his always outstaning performance. The Hughes brothers took great pains to recreate all the nastiness of Whitechapel and did a decent job at recreating the murders and the further the plot. I was able to overlook the liberties taken with Moore's work and sit back and just enjoy it- at first.
Unfortunately I thought the end was a cheesy Hollywood compromise. Even if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have liked it. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'll just say I was very disappointed. It was too much of a Hollywood cliche' for something that, up to that point, was really solid work.  What's most disappointing about all of this is that the Hughes brothers really strayed from their normal modus operendi to try something new.  What could have been a real triumph for them eventually turned out as a mere stab at main-stream mediocrity.",1014681600,,1575,4.281879194630872
1441163,2,B00005JKJM,"For all its superb production design (by Martin Childs, Oscar-winner for ""Shakespeare in Love""), and stunning and authentic visuals depicting late-Victorian England, ""From Hell"" remains unsatisfactory because, instead of creating a mystery, thrill, or horror, the film tries to ""explain"" murky events surrounding Jack the Ripper.
No one will question the value of cinematography in ""From Hell,"" but the tedious development of story damages the film very much as the Hughes Brothers throw too many things into the film.  If you don't know anything about Jack the Ripper, you might be puzzled before the Masonic conspiracy, a kidney sent to the police, a message on the wall, and alleged involvement of the royal family.  All these factors are certainly based on truth, as 'Ripperians' or people who study this serial murder case (including Allan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel) know, but they are all crammed into such a disjointed way that during the two hour of the film's running time, we start to lose interests.  To make matters worse, the filmmakers tries to send a social comment about the cold-hearted nature of upper-class society of Victorians through the characters of Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.  England may be a class-society, but those caricatures (with their histrionic performance) only perplexed me, making the entire film a very unstable stance whether I should be angry with them, or chilled with the Ripper.  I get the point, but they should have been restricted the film's subject within the murders, without extending it to its social cause.
About other aspects, I have little to say.  The casting of Heather Graham could have been justified if she looked a little more like a prostitute, or the film did not take itself so seriously.  As the basic story is sentimental and melodramatic, they could have made it more outrageous and suspeseful, and in that case, Ms. Graham might have got away with her uneven  accent.  Of course, then, the Hughes Brothers must take much more liberty with the original book, and its meticulous details would be gone.  In the end, as the result shows, they took a fairly serious approach, and I respect that decision.  However, I confess, as I went through the two hours in theater, I thought I might as well be reading the original book.
""From Hell"" is a stylish film, but as a thriller it falls short of good pace and enough chill, and as a film noir, its subject is too intriguing and thrilling with detailed information to be made into a flat melodrama.  Using the same subject, Alfred Hitchcock once directed a silent film ""The Lodger (1926).""  It remains stylish even today, but he completely changed the related facts to draw audience into his world.

1441165,5,B00005JKJM,"It has been historically proven that this Jack The Ripper Tale contains THE most accurately portrayed Ripper murders ever to be seen on film!  Johnny Depp and Heather Graham star in this amazing version of what is now considered the most infamous and mysterious crime known to modern man!  Portraying the detective hired to crack the case, Depp delivers what I consider one of the most powerful and multi-leveled performances of his career.  Heather Graham not only masters her cockney accent to perfection as the most notorious victim, Mary Kelly, but makes you believe she truly is her character, as she and the entire cast sends you back to White Chapel Distract, London, at the turn of the 20th century.  Bringing you back in time to a world of prostitution, drugs and murder.
The Hughes Brothers, the same directors that brought you such films as ""Dead Presidents"" and ""Menace II Society"", conjure up another masterpiece!!  Famous for their street-violence-themed films, From Hell takes its rightful place within that genre.

1441166,4,B00005JKJM,"By now the gimmick of the brilliant, renegade investigator whose special insights into the nature of serial murder border on, if not actually cross into, the paranormal has become rather tiresome.  However, this type of character has apparently become an indispensible part of the serial killer genre (what does it say about us that such a genre exists?), and directors Allen and Albert Hughes have presented an interesting twist by making it necessary for Scotland Yard inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), hot on the trail of Jack the Ripper, to use opium in order to access his gift.  This adds to the overall dark and hopeless tone of this fine film, and ultimately makes Depp's character rather tragic.
This is a very stylish, atmospheric film that occurs almost entirely at night on foggy London streets.  I enjoyed the sad romantic subplot, although Heather Graham's Mary Kelly is too well-scrubbed to be a convincing Whitehall prostitute.  I also enjoyed the Freemason angle and way the Hughes brothers focus on the importance of class distinctions and how the wealthy fashion their own brand of justice.",1008374400,,1110,5.082417582417582

1441170,4,B00005JKJM,"From Hell is a disturbing film about a disturbing man.  It is brilliantly executed, though, and if you have ever been curious about Jack the Ripper, then this is one to watch.  Definitely not for the faint of stomach, From Hell deals with a very realistic side of the Jack the Ripper murders.
Johnny Depp is fantastic as the tragedy plagued inspector.  He carries the film in grand style, as always, and brings intrigue and mystery to the screen.
The film is better if you have a basic knowledge of the Jack the Ripper murders, and theories regarding who the killer was.  While living in London, I learned about the murders and was intrigued by the theories, and the lack of any decisive evidence.
The film combines several of the theories, and makes for an intriguing guess as to who the killer may have been.
The direction in this film is superb.  The screen aches with the eerie Whitechapel London setting, making it understandable how these murders could have occured while people were nearby.  It is a dark film, but this darkness is used in a brilliant fashion, highlighting and lowlighting particular scenes.
All in all I give it ****, because it is a remarkably well-done period piece, with a courageous plot, although Heather Graham's performance was her usual standard.  The supporting cast was fairly good, and therefore, it merits its rating.  See this one in the theaters... Enjoy!

1441192,5,B00005JKJM,"Johnny Depp is a versatile actor who puts in an excellent performance as the tormented Police Inspector, Fred Abberline working on the infamous Jack the Ripper case during the reign of Queen Victoria.  Taking many Jack the Ripper legends, the Hughes brothers have created an amazing patchwork quilt of interlinking stories that are drawn together to reveal the identity of a mass murderer who was never bought to justice.  The most famous legend is that the Queen's son and heir to the throne married a commoner, Annie Crook and she bore him a child, and it is this setting that sets the film off on a ride to hell and back.  Abberline doggedly searches for a killer who has taken on mythical qualities, and bit-by-bit he puts together an intricate plot, of royal intrigue and scandal, insanity and corruption in high places.  Not that Abberline is uncorrupted himself, addicted to opium and haunted by the death of his wife in childbirth, he is already half-way to hell himself but redemption comes in the form of Mary Kelly, a beautiful fallen Irish girl who he strives to protect against all odds.  But Abberline is up against the British establishment and the might of Her Majesty's empire, in the guise of Sir Charles Warren played excellently by Ian Richardson and Sir William Gull, Ian Holm at his schizophrenic best.  We are treated to a tour around Victorian London with all its vices from drug taking to rampant prostitution whilst we head for the shattering climax that will reveal everything.  ""From Hell"" is a film of extraordinary color and vicious vitality.  The camera work is superb and the constant shadowy silhouette of Jack the Ripper gives an eerie feel to an already creepy film.  Blood is aplenty in this film and it is not a movie for the squeamish.  The worst scene is at the end when Jack kills Mary Kelly (there's a little twist here that will amuse those of a dark nature) and Ian Holm just explodes on the screen with the madness of someone on a holy quest for the British Empire.  The lobotomy scene where Annie is driven into madness is also quite disturbing, but there is justice for Annie in an ironic twist at the end of the film.  This movie isn't a horror film though it has horrific qualities.  I do think that many scenes were cut out which I hope will be incorporated onto DVD in the future because I notice from the cast list there are characters we never saw on screen like Annie Crook's parents.  However, despite this minor detail ""From Hell"" is a truly amazing film, with just enough suspense to make you sit on the edge of your seat, and just enough gore to make you, swallow hard and think ""oh gross"" before being distracted by another scene that makes you think real hard because of its complexity.  On a final note, Robbie Coltrane is the bomb as Abberline's cynical but good-hearted Sergeant, Peter Godley whose understanding of human nature is understated and truly awesome.  A cast of quality actors all the way through, from the doomed friends of Mary Kelly, through to little Alice Crook, the daughter of the ill-fate Annie and her husband, Albert, aka the future King of England.",1005436800,10,3133,4.669090909090909
1441193,2,B00005JKJM,"Reviews for this looked decent, so we took a chance on it. But it was soooo dark, as in looming, evil, negative.
Being big into positive psychology (my website is positivepsychology.net) I'm not much of a film noir fan, nor a horror fan, so keep that in mind in reading this review.  I found the premise for this Jack the Ripper film intriguing and smart. The sets portraying  the Victorian era were excellent. That's why I gave it a two instead of a one. But the gory, excessive violence of the film was unnecessary. We don't need this kind of energy put out by the film industry.
Most films are strongest at their beginning and ending. This one did best in the middle. The ending was disappointing and unsatisfying.
 The romantic aspect of the film was pathetic, the relationship development was millimeter deep.
Johnny Depp gave a mixed performance, below his usual quality, probably due to  the script he had to work with.
If you are feeling depresed or angry and want to feel more of the same, watch this film.
Bottom line, I'm glad I only threw away five bucks on a matinee performance.
While most of my reviews are positive, I find that the three or four negative reviews I've written get ""not useful"" feedback far more than my glowing reviews. If you disagree with my review, write your own review. Don't just say it wasn't helpful, when you really just disagree with me.

1441194,4,B00005JKJM,"In Dostoyevsky's *Crime and Punishment*, the identity of the murderer was revealed in contiguity with the murder itself.  The ""mystery"" was not WHO-dunnit but rather the metaphysics of WHY.  Likewise with the Alan Moore graphic novel, in which the Ripper's identity was revealed early on, followed by a discursive analysis of what such a figure could *mean* to us, the role of the modern serial killer in our new, darkly reconfigured Zeitgeist.
Understandably, the film version of *From Hell* keeps the blindfold on till the end, but as a ""conventional"" mystery-thriller it is a remarkably stylish affair, decked with savage bits of oddball whimsy and bizarro non sequiturs (the Elephant Man scene was both totally unnecessary and a fulsome delight).  Scenes that normally would have been scrapped after unfavorable audience-testing are courageously retained in their stark gutsy splendor.  Even the gushy, melodramatic denouement (reminiscent of the closing hallucination of Terry Gilliam's *Brazil*) was put into doubt by a fade-in to Inspector Abberline's forehead, implying that it was just another wistful opium dream.  Brilliant.
Never mind that the script is jerry-rigged from stock chills and an assortment of laborsaving cliches (the contrived love-story is truly From Hell).  Never mind that Heather Graham is the most unconvincing celluloid-whore since Julia Roberts in *Pretty Woman*, magically retaining her beauty-salon sheen while her fellow strumpets seem (quite convincingly) caked in filth.  Never mind that the garish sound-stages make London look like a boxed-in diorama in a wax museum (remember *Bram Stoker's Dracula*?).  *From Hell* packs real panache.
The screenwriters preserve as much of Moore's original vision as possible within commercial constraints.  True, characters are often conflated (Inspector Abberline and the fraud-psychic Mr. Lees become a single person), events are simplified and/or reorganized into chase-scenes and other stock devices, but so much of the original novel is stubbornly retained, even when the producers must have been breathing down the Hughes brothers' necks for more cuts (pun intended).  Most good mysteries have at least two or three likely suspects for us to keep tabs on, but *From Hell* convincingly provides five or six, and those unprejudiced by the novel may be delighted when our Masonic free-agent is unmasked, resplendent in his wily dementia.
*From Hell*'s most stark quality lies in the rift between the gaslit grunge of Whitechapel and the opulent intrigues of the Royalist upper class.  The rift begins to close when it is revealed that the Prince is dying of syphilis, but shudders closer upon Inspector Abberline's deduction that Saucy Jack must be an aristocrat and gentlemen, an academy-trained sawbones and anatomist, bred in the highest circles, elected to the Masonic underworld (whose pretentions are wonderfully deflated at the end of the film by the Ripper himself), but condemned by history, madness, and ritualistic fury to storm the ghetto, to close the class-gap in a thick red moment of egalitarian butchery.

1441195,4,B00005JKJM,"Firstly, I admit I am a bit biased for I adore Johnny Depp and I am partcularly partial to Victorian England settings. Having said this, I was prepared for eye candy and nothing more. What I got was much, much more.
The film has amazing twists and turns and is pure suspense throughout. From the very beginning you are wondering who is this Jack the Ripper and just when you think you may have a guess, the plot thickens! I don't want to give away the story-line but there is an incredible high-society connection in this that will blow you away and perhaps, could very well be possible. The performances are brilliant, entire cast. The cinematography is breathtaking and for Victorian England, in the Whitechapel District, that is a major accomplishment. It's just gory enough, there has to be a bit of blood associated with Jack the Ripper and they could have gone way over the top with blood and gore but they didn't they kept a wonderful balance, enough to make you cringe, but not enough to send you running for the nearest exit.
It is very obvious that the writer did thier homework for the connections based on actual historical facts are unreal! I am told this was based on a comic book and the wirters and producers have done an amazing job, not to mention the director.
I don't think this is Academy Award Material, but it is certainly a film that is a cut above most of the ones in circulation.",1004918400,2,1405,4.513725490196078
1441196,4,B00005JKJM,"What can I say, I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't as good as I expected, but was entertaining.
Being the comic book geek that I am, I went into the movie expecting a sprawling epic, and suspensful tale of Jack the Rippers murders.  Instead we get a rather convulted story that sort of sticks to the plot of Alan Moores original graphic novel but not really.  Having read the behomth From Hell a few times now, I can point to parts where more character development could have been alittle better.  Particularly with the character of William Gull.  In the book he is much more of a disturbed psycho than in the movie.  He books shows that he used to cut up animals as a kid, and had a bad experience sexually with his wife.  His obsession with the freemason rhetoric is also very disturbing in his book as well as the fact that he believes he is creating a work of art.  All of these things would have helped in character development and made it much more disturbing.  Johnny Depp plays a decent Aberline, and looks the part, other than the fact Aberline in the book is alittle more plump.  Heather Graham seems oddly out of place in this movie.  Now why is it all the other prostitutes are ugly and she is the only good looking one of the bunch.  She does a good job as Mary Kelly though.
  Another thing I noticed was the romance seems to very aparent in the movie, but in the book it is more or less implied.  In the book they don't even know each others names and when she disapears Aberline doesn't really know what to think.
  In my opinion the best scene in the movie was when Gull is taking out Kellys heart.  He hallucinates that he is doing an anatomy lesson is very chilling and psychological.  Overall I realize the book and the movie are diffrent, but I still like From Hell quite a bit.  It was one of the better adaptations I have seen in a while.",1004918400,,1859,4.287356321839081
1441197,3,B00005JKJM,"From Hell (The Hughes Brothers, 2001)

Wondertwins Albert and Allen Hughes re-emerge
(finally!) after five years to bring us their third
Hollywood cinematic effort, From Hell. (In the
interim, they filmed and released independently a
feature-length documentary called American Pimp,
recently reviewed here.) Based on Alan (Watchmen)
Moore's graphic novel, the tale focuses on Fred
Abberline (Johnny Depp), a Scotland Yard inspector
who, unfortunately for him, lands the case of Jack the
Ripper. (Note: the main IMDB page for the movie
contains a MAJOR spoiler, so avoid it if you're
planning on seenig the movie.) Abberline is a
precognitive, and aids his visions with liberal use of
opium and its derivative laudanum, often landing in
subterranean opium dens, usually to be hauled out by
staunch sidekick Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane of
_Cracker_ fame). As they delve deeper into the
investigation, they find that maybe bureaucracy isn't
all that's holding them up; Abberline finds himself
watched by Scotland Yard's Special Branch, headed by
the sinister Ben Kidney (veteran character actor
Terence Harvey).

The movie is put together beautifully; not a scene is
ill-shot or out of place, and the violence inherent in
a retelling of the Ripper story is kept to an
as-tasteful-as-possible minimum. The sweeping
cinematography is on a par with Alex Proyas' similarly
claustrophobic Dark City (1998), and the film's
atmosphere is quite successful at drawing the veiwer
in.

Where From Hell fails its two Hughes-helmed
predecessors is in the characterization. No character
here gets the same pervasive treatment as did O-Dogg
in _Menace II Society_, for example; many minor
characters seem cardboard cutouts, and even Abberline
and obligatory love interest (and historical Ripper
victim) Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, finally coming up
with a role with as much potential as the one she had
in _Drugstore Cowboy_) don't really get the depth of
character they deserve. The characters are all too
readily predictable, and the snarkier part of my mind
wants to lay that fault at the doorstep of Alan Moore;
after all, the Hughes Brothers have a long-established
track record of bringing characters to life.

Which brings us to the other predictable element of
the move: the plot. Even those unfamiliar with various
Ripper hypotheses should be able to figure out who the
Ripper is by halfway through the film, and the twist
ending should be obvious even before the scene starts;
despite this, Albert and Allen do have one last twist
of the knife left for the penultimate scene. While the
film doesn't resolve as satisfactorily as did Menace
or Dead Presidents, Hollywood hasn't completely taken
over the wunderkinder yet.

It's certainly not the tour de force Menace II Society
was, but From Hell is a surprisingly literate thriller
in a year that's given us the usual Hollywood helping
of mindless dreck; another pearl in the string that
already holds Memento and The Others. Too bad it has
to be cast among such swine as See Spot Run, Jurassic
Park III, The Princess Diaries, etc. etc. ad nauseam.

1441198,4,B00005JKJM,"Let me clear this up from the start: this is not a slasher film in same sense as what normally fills that genre (Scream, etc..). This film fits more of the whodunnnit murder mystery genre, but it's about the most famous slasher in world history so it's inevitably going to be associated with slasher films.
I really love when stories based on true events come up with very creative answers to the questions history doesn't have for us. The plot in this film evolves from ""Who is Jack the Ripper?"" into something much bigger. The writers definately take some artistic liberty with the plot; turning a simple murder mystery into something more epic involving the monarchy government and secret societies. Since Jack the Ripper was never caught, these fictionalizations create a very interesting motivation for the main character.
The acting in this movie was impressive. Johnny Depp really stands out as a British Police Inspector who's addicted to Opium. The scenes aren't for the squeamish but they aren't overly gorey either; the film only shows enough to get it's point across.
It's been quite some time since I saw film of this genre, much less of this calibre. If you are looking for something a bit different than the normal Hollywood junk-movie, give this film a try.",1004832000,9,1273,4.870967741935484
1441199,3,B00005JKJM,"I've read several reviews below that say ""From Hell"" does not glorify violence, and most of the killing is done off screen.  I beg to differ!  I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I almost had to leave the theatre.  The murders start out relatively tame:  a woman is pulled into a dark alley, and we see the glint of a knife as it comes up and down repeatedly.  Not too gross, but definitely effective.  As the film progresses, though, the murders and their aftermaths become more gruesome.  Another victim's body is found disembowled, and little is left to our imaginations at this point.  A third victim's murder is shown to us in graphic detail--a woman is held while her throat is slashed.  Notice how I say slashed and not ""cut""--blood spews in every direction.  The next victim's demise is almost just as bad--a shadow seems to step in front of her, and when it leaves, blood is bellowing from her throat.  And the FINAL victim?  Well, if you've ever seen pictures of the real fifth victim, you'll know that the Ripper didn't leave much to be identified here.  And the film doesn't hold back in this depiction of violence.  Perhaps it's not the grossest movie ever made, but in such a realistic environment and tone, the blood and gore seem very horrendous and hard to watch.",1004659200,3,1277,4.568281938325991

It is hard to imagine a more thoroughly researched screenplay than this superb offering.  Late 19th-Century dialogue hits the mark dead on, putting such heavyweights as ""Titanic"" to shame in this category.  How did the screenwriter do it?  From research on drug addiction/abuse, prostitution, medical science, 19th-Century London and Free Masonry, the script could not have been more carefully constructed, thoroughly entertaining and equally horrific.  Not glorifying violence in the least, this rendering shows human depravity in the worst most unimagineable recesses of evil.  In other words, from hell.",1004400000,5,803,5.595041322314049
1441233,4,B00005JKJM,"Those expecting a good scare in the vein of Wes Craven will be sorely disappointed in ""From Hell,"" the latest take on the infamous Jack the Ripper, done in a style of elegant and yet so perverse that one cannot help but become wrapped up in this dark yet absorbing tale. The latest film from the Hughes Brothers is a gossamer blanket of elegant settings crossed with the depraved regions of the darkest of human thoughts, with inklings of the psychological and conspiracy.
The story seems to be aimed more at those who know little about the history of Jack the Ripper, putting a fictional spin on the events leading up to the still-unsolved case involving a series of notorious murders in London's Whitecastle district. In this degraded section of the capital, prostitutes fill the streets, five of which form a tightly knit group of friends. At the center of these women is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who will become the love interest to Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), who is assigned to the cases of the murders.
Of course, Abberline has more connection to the gruesome events than he wishes. His dreams allow him to foresee the crimes before they happen, a plot point that doesn't quite reach fruition by film's end. His psychological connection to the events is never really capitalized on, and since there is really no need for it, what there is in the film seems out of place.
The movie also takes its time to generate some momentum, and some will find the sequence of events boring rather than interesting. This is no a whodunit in the traditional sense: the clues in the beginning are less intriguing than those towards the end, and the action is almost null. I consider this to be one of the film's attributes, taking its time in delivering small clues that will lead to larger ones, while keeping the cheap thrills at a minimum.
As the plot progresses, it begins to generate some genuine suspense. From the murder scenes, Abberline begins gathering his physical evidence, from things such as grape branches to the smell of expensive alcohol on the victims' lips. He discovers that the women killed by the Ripper compose the circle of friends to which Mary belongs, making it more of a personal vendetta, a particularly effective angle once the final act begins.
This new working of the legendary serial killer is quite a stylish trip, I must say, boasting some of the most impressive visual scenes of this year. Scenes that reveal the glory of London soon transform into the degradation and run-down conditions of the poor sectors, while the murder scenes have the good taste to keep most of the gruesome, gory detail hidden from view. The recreation of London in the 19th century is meticulous and bursting with authenticity, a lavish set and costume design achievement.
The underlying mystery also keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, and those who enjoy exposition over thrills will find it rather interesting. It sparks a new twist that involves many of London's highly regarded officials, even a figure of royalty. As the beginning begins to unfold, nothing seems to fit together, but as the story progresses, the pieces become clearer. Most importantly, it keeps its surprises well hidden, making them that much more effective once they are revealed.
Johnny Depp is back in fine form, and his performance here is sure to remind audiences of his spectacular acting in Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow."" In Abberline, he plays the same kind of character, but with an edgier lifestyle, and a more straightforward attitude. It's good to see Heather Graham in a genre that befits her talent; comedy doesn't seem to be her strong suit, but her role as Mary in this film allows her to give us a wonderful performance. She and Depp share a terrific offbeat chemistry, one that makes the movie's bittersweet resolution for the two deeply affecting.
I've never really known much about the legend of Jack the Ripper short of seeing ""From Hell,"" and even I have my doubts about its historical accuracy in regards to the sequence of events leading to the fictional twist in the end. Even still, the film is bursting with elements of the macabre and the gothic, and carries a well-suited cast to pull off a nicely paced plot; this is a pretty impressive production.",1004227200,3,4273,4.822888283378747

What he finds are twists, surprises, and an unspeakable conspiracy.
The film was brilliantly directed and the cinematography was outstanding.  The acting was also very good and believable.  There are a few parts in the movie which seem slow and kind of drags the movie out.  Some of the violence in the movie is hard to watch, but is very neccisary.  This isn't a movie you're going to want to see over and over again, due to it being so disturbing and graphic.
Please, if you are a parent, DO NOT bring you children to this movie.  I cannot tell you how many parents I saw at the movie with 6 and 7 year olds.
All in all, this was a very good movie.  It's not one I'm going to watch over and over again, but it is worth seeing.  You may not like it if you're expecting a horror movie that will make you jump out of your seat.  It certianly scares you with its disturbing elements.  See the movie for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  I thought this was a great movie with brilliant directing, acting, and most of all, story.",1004140800,,1598,4.315436241610739
1441237,2,B00005JKJM,"""FROM HELL"" is an interesting visual exercise with a rich and haunting musical score. The performances are all very good, though Heather Graham as a whore in 1888 is a hell of a stretch (Heather Graham as a whore in 2001 would be a stretch). Ian Holm is creepily effective as a royal doctor with an agenda. The ending is very wonky, coming out of left field. But for me, having been around long enough to have watched a lot of movies over the last thirty years, I have to say I got a nagging sense of dj vu.
At least one reviewer here has already mentioned the similarity between this film and the 1979 Bob Clark film ""MURDER BY DECREE."" The similarities are quite striking.
Except for the fact that MBD (made 20 years before the graphic novel FROM HELL was published) had as its detectives Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (Christopher Plummer and James Mason), ""FROM HELL"" could qualify as a re-make. Both flicks have: (A) the detectives becoming involved with Mary Kelly while trying to stop her murder, (B) a royal physician involved in a cover-up, (C) the Masons secret order trying to save the monarchy, (D) an illegitimate baby born to the same historic royal suspect in both movies (you even have amazingly similar madhouse scenes in which the detective visits the baby's mother - Genevieve Bujold in the first movie), (E) a psychic who uses laudanum (Donald Sutherland in MBD), (F) a killer transported by coach and - (G) in what may be a visual reference to MBD by the Hughes brothers - the use of oversized black contact lenses in the eyes of the killer at one point in ""FROM HELL"" which is the same technique used to make the killer's eyes scary in MBD. The near-to-final images of both films (by the sea shore) are almost identical. There are probably many other similarities, but it's been a long time since I've seen MBD.
""FROM HELL"" is obviously a slicker movie (22 years worth of additional technological advances in filmmaking plus a much, much larger budget) but both it and the 1999 graphic novel on which it is based owe a huge debt of inspiration to ""MURDER BY DECREE"" which for my money is the more entertaining vehicle. So ... just a caution that not everyone will think ""FROM HELL"" quite as original as many younger viewers believe.",1004140800,,2255,4.584158415841584
1441238,1,B00005JKJM,"I thought the 19th Century Cockney prostitutes in the Jack The Ripper film, ""From Hell"" were going to break into a musical number from ""Oliver"" at any given moment. They were so darn Cockney and seemed forever on the verge of fully realizing their Dickens-like caricatures. They could have belted out ""Consider yourself a friend, consider yourself one of the family!"", at the most inappropriate moment, like when Jack slashes them into what could only be described as a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and I don't believe I would have batted an eye. Just expecting the unexpected. Old Jack's evil legendary status gets a bit tarnished here. It turns out he's a Simon Legree type or something a little more vague, like ancient Druids. I think I get it though. Jack The Ripper didn't kill those prostitutes, society did. I suppose society built The Pyramids and killed John F. Kennedy as well. Ho-hum. The only mystery left is how much time was spent coming up with the wonderfully creative title of this film. Towards the end I thought, ""Oh it is a farce! The cast is going to break into a chorus of ""The Sound Of Music"" on a European mountaintop!"", but no, no, forget it Jack, it's Londontown. Big budget sequel minded merry London. I can see it now. Jack is Back! Just when you thought it was safe to parade around old London in a frilly dress.",1004140800,9,1350,4.605809128630705
1441239,5,B00005JKJM,"It is 11:59pm and I have just returned from the theatres watching ""From Hell"". Two words float in my mind: ""Beautiful"" and ""Perfection"".
It is based on the very famous Jack The Ripper who was the first and deadliest serial killer played by... (just kidding).
Johnny Depp plays as the detective with psychic powers who sees the victims before (and sometimes after) they get murdered. Heather Graham is a prostitute who's fellow 'employees' are beening murdered by The Ripper, who is on the list as well.
The visionary and extremely dark environment is quite Oscar[tm] worthy, the acting is superbe by absolutly every actor/actress and the level of violence and gore is not recommending this film to children. The story of a conspiracy and a hint of religion is brought up so well that I almost melted in my seat from the genius and perfection of it.
This film goes up on my 'favourit movies' list and I recommend it to anybody who thinks they may like it (just beware the violence).",1004054400,,981,4.709302325581396
1441240,2,B00005JKJM,"When I first saw the trailer for ""From Hell"", I was understandably ecstatic.  Based on graphic novel of the same name, written by Alan Moore, I had really high hopes for this one.  Judging by the previews, it looked as though the Hughes brothers might do it justice.  But alas, as film adaptions of books often go, they butchered it.  Let's start with Johnny Depp's character, Inspector Abberline.  They turn him from an honest and hardworking detective that slowly develops some feelings for a young prostitute, into an opium-addicted clairvoyant that falls madly in love with the aformentioned hooker (Heather Graham).  And speaking of Heather Graham, could they have made a more horrible choice for a 19th century prostitute?  The other hookers in the film look, well, like they should (ugly), but Graham sticks out like a sore thumb.  As for the story, this butchery is typical of big Hollywood films.  The book focused on the character of Jack the Ripper more than anyone else in the story.  In fact, he was revealed in Chapter 2!  That's what made it so fascinating: the book went inside the killer's head and tried to explain the motivations for his gruesome killings, besides the obvious ones presented in the film.  It deconstructed and analyzed a truly twisted mind and tried to convey how, in the words of Alan Moore, ""Human experience went to the very edge...then stepped beyond"".  The film turns into a typical whodunit, keeping you guessing until he is revealed at the very end. Anyway, I've ranted long enough.  See the film if you want - for pure entertainment, you'll probably enjoy it.  But if you want a richly textured and fascinating, albeit fictional, story about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, read the book.",1004054400,15,1754,4.8389261744966445
1441241,5,B00005JKJM,"Having read several books on the subject, I have been very disappointed by the few ""stabs"" Hollywood has taken at Jack the Ripper in the past.  This time they got it right.  The facts are a little twisted and the theory they use (which was, perhaps, the best on which to base a movie) has been repeatedly discredited, but it doesn't matter a bit.  I found the movie beautiful to look at, suberbly crafted and well acted.  Johnny Depp is excellent as a fictional equivalent of lead investigator Inspector Frederick Abberline and is well-supported.  Heather Graham also does a fine job as Mary Kelly, the last Ripper victim, and cited to be the prettiest, although no pictures of a living Kelly exist.  The attention to detail is meticulous and the directors maintain a high degree of tension throughout the film, quite a trick with a well-known story.  There is quite a bit of gore, but then how can you do a Ripper movie without gore?  All in all, I couldn't be more pleased with this effort, no doubt the best Jack the Ripper movie ever made.",1004054400,7,1043,4.56989247311828
1441262,2,B00005JKJM,"I love Jack the Ripper tales, and was really anticipating this movie.  As the credits began to roll, however, I felt extremely unsatisfied.
The atmosphere is good as is the direction, Depp and Graham (who I wanted to see more of) were both convincing, but the problems here lies within the script.  I recently read the review of the Last Castle, and people said the same thing.  Why is Hollywood rushing these movies when they obviously are not ready?
Anyway, Depp's character gets high and has visions.  This was not the type of movie I was expecting.  I wanted to see a real detective investigate the scenes more and describe the criminal.  Jack the Ripper was never truly identified, but this movie offers its own conclusion.  A strange conclusion, but one nonetheless.  I would have preferred an even darker movie, with more of a foreboding atmosphere.  Also, it would have creepier if a killer was never truly seen or identified. Depp's final scene is laughable and DOES NOT belong in a movie like this.  I want more of a creepy murder mystery than an awkward love story!!!
I've heard comments about how Heather Graham is the prettiest prostitute and it's true--all of her friends are ugly yet they're getting the men.",1003881600,3,1223,4.753554502369668
1441263,4,B00005JKJM,"I went and saw this in the theatre over the weekend. I can't say I've heard such a quiet audience, completely enrapured in the screen images.  Johnny Depp is an intuitive inspector, assigned to the heinous crimes comitted against the ""Unfortunate Women"" of a seedy London Neighborhood.  To bad about that Heroin addiction that caused him to chase the dragon until the end.  Heather Graham plays Mary, one of the last victims of the man who gave birth to the 20th century.  I won't include any spoilers, but the last 30 minutes are of course the best.  I was swept in the emotion of the moments, and felt pity for the man who caused all of this mayhem.  Please DO NOT take your children to see this movie, there are several graphic images.  Although they are few and far between, each one is a vignette of bloody tragedy.  This is more suspense than it is thriller, and it is sure to be one of those movies you watch on a chilly night, wrapped up close to someone.",1003708800,,963,4.401129943502825
1441264,5,B00005JKJM,"To clear up a misconception about the title of the film - ""From Hell"" is a quote from a letter that Jack The Ripper sent to the police. It is the one letter that most experts agree is actually from the Ripper. This is briefly shown in the film as part of the evidence.
The whole idea of the motivation for the killings in this film is not new. There is a film, ""Murder By Decree"", about Sherlock Holmes going after the Ripper with the same motivation for the killings as in ""From Hell"". The idea that the women killed by Jack were all witnesses to the Roman Catholic marriage of the Prince and prostitute who then produced a child, is the same in both films. Both of the girls end up in an asylum unable to communicate with the outside world. If it were known by the outside world that there was a Catholic heir to the throne of England, it would have torn the country apart. In both films, the Ripper carrying out orders from higher authority. In both there is also a link to the Masons. Perhaps this is not such a fantastic premise. In one of the many books on the actual Ripper, Abberline, the actual detective on the case, is quoted as saying that they did know who the Ripper was, but could do nothing because of who he was.
Taking all this into consideration, ""From Hell"" is an excellent film. The atmosphere of Victorian London is extremely well presented. It might, in other production hands, have turned into a slasher film, but the killings are not that sensational. There are very quick glimses of bodies and quick cuts away from them. They are based on the actual autopsy photos of the victims (and there are existing photos of all the bodies). The acting by all the performers is excellent, not one false note from any of them. The most appealing character is Heather Graham as Mary Kelly, the last of the victims. Her romance with Johnny Depp as Abberline (named after the real person, but not at all like the actual man) is extremely well handled.
There are some excellent surprises in the resolution of the story that are extremely plausible leading to a bittersweet ending.
A recommendation is to view both this film and the Sherlock Holmes ""Murder By Decree"". Both are excellent films and well worth the comparison.",1003708800,,2233,4.502463054187192
1441265,4,B00005JKJM,"The most important thing you need to know about ""From Hell,"" is that the Hughes Brothers really let you off easy with this one.  When you go home after seeing this movie late at night and have trouble getting to sleep, just remember that they could have shown you a lot more, which means you might not have gotten to sleep for a week.  I have read Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel ""From Hell,"" and have also spent some time researching the historical record regarding Jack the Ripper, which includes not only autopsy reports but also photographs of the victims.  Consequently, I was surprised that the film verion of ""From Hell"" actually backed off three times from completely grossing out the audience.

First, when the Ripper killed Annie Chapman he draped some of her intestines over her shoulder.  The film does not even suggest this happened, beyond the idea that organs have been removed.  Second, the night the Ripper claimed two victims, most Ripperologists have surmised that because he was interrupted when he killed Liz Stride, he was really angry when he killed Catherine Eddowes, since he hacked away the bottom half of her face.  But when her face is revealed it is just the same as the other victims.  Finally, when the doctor begins to describe the final body--usual the very words of the actual report--he stops after having described the position of the corpse.  More to the point, he stops before describing what Jack did with her organs.  Believe me, you do not need to see this to freak out because just hearing about it would keep you awake all night.  Now, to be fair, the dialogue is the same as that scene in the graphic novel; but then Moore and Campbell had already devoted a entire volume to what Jack the Ripper did that night in graphic detail so it did not have to be articulated.  But I was all set to hear the one of the biggest audience moans in cinematic history and was somewhat disappointed the Hughes Brothers let everybody off the hook.

Ironically, the Hughes Brothers could legitimately get away with showing us much more blood and guts.  After all, the autopsy reports tell us in excruciating detail what the Ripper did to each of his victims and they could simply claim historical accuracy.  But instead they pull up short, giving them even more latitude for getting away with what gore they do offer up.  However, during Abberline's vision of what will happen to Jack the Ripper's final victim, one of the images that flashes before our eyes is indeed a photograph taken by the police of the mutilated body of Mary Kelly.  This only goes to reinforce the great divide that exists between those who have studied the murders of Jack the Ripper and/or read ""From Hell"" and those who simply know Jack the Ripper killed a bunch of prostitutes in London in the late 19th century and was never caught.

Certainly, the Hughes Brothers do play with us in this film.  If you can stomach seeing it a second time, or if you already know who ""From Hell"" contends is the Ripper, then they are several scenes were Abberline is tantalizingly close to the killer.  Of course, they are not alone in such regard; ""The Bone Collector"" was particularly audacious in offering us a first glimpse of the killer.  Moore and Campbell let us know the identity of Jack from before he ever starts his killing spree, but the movie version decides to keep it a mystery and apparently succeeds in surprising those who only know about ""From Hell"" from the trailer and television commercials.

The Hughes Brothers have described ""From Hell"" as a ""ghetto"" film, and certainly the production design stands out in providing a fitting atmosphere for the tale.  The events we are watching are not taking place in the London we have come to know from countless Hammer horror films but in what we readily accept as the city's Whitechapel district in the fall of 1888 (with Prague doubling nicely).  This is as stylish a slasher flick as you will ever see, with the time-lapse sequence of the discovery of one of the bodies and the revelation of the Masonic meeting beneath the streets of London particularly memorable.  Even the lighting works towards the proper atmosphere for the story.

Johnny Depp's performance as Inspector Abberline is nicely understated (the character's psychic visions come from a fake psychic who was in the graphic novel).  Unfortunately, Heather Graham is just too darn cute, sticking out from the rest of the totally believable group of prostitutes (Annabelle Apsion, Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch and Lesley Sharp).  I had heard that the producers made actually made them shoot a ""happy ending"" to this film, but fortunately they had the wisdom not to use it.  Ripperologists knew going in that this was not going to be the ""true"" story about Jack, so that additional liberties such as all of the victims hanging out together all the time and the total absence of men in any of their lives, are easily forgivable.  What was always impressive about Moore's tale was how he managed to weave so many different elements together into a comprehensive tale, even if it is ultimately suspect.  But the film version strips the story down to its essentials and while it is certainly the best Jack the Ripper film made to date, I cannot shake my head and think how much better it could have been by letting the audience glimpse just a little bit more of the true story.

But, oh, boys and girls, ""From Hell"" could have upset you a whole lot more than it did.  If only you can understand how close to the edge of the cliff you were on this one...",1003708800,103,5581,4.691282051282052
1441266,3,B00005JKJM,"As a film, Alan Moore's From Hell is a beautifully stunning period piece that has carefully reconstructed the gruesome Whitechapel slayings at the notorious hand of ""Saucy Jack"" with thoroughly researched ""precision.""  Johnny Depp, fresh from his Victorian era performance as Constable Ichabod Crane in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow once again portrays a 19th century English Inspector, Frederick Abberline, and delivers a worthy performance to surpass his previously similar role.  Heather Graham is aptly cast as the prostitute Mary Kelly and gives a very good performance here although we never actually see her ""prostituting"" herself, presumably to make the audience sympathize with her as a more respectable ""Unfortunate"" as they are properly referred to and to which she is quick to correct the Inspector at the slightest inference that she is a whore.  There are some brilliant establishing shots of London under a blood red sky that establish the foreboding atmosphere of this meticulously stylish thriller.  The Hughes Brothers have successfully delivered what looks like a first-rate epic film on the subject of Jack the Ripper.
The problem then falls, not on the Hughes Brothers themselves, but rather with Alan Moore's story.  First, this film is a translation from Moore's epic-sized graphic novel (an adult-oriented comic book novel) and the result is an extravagantly fictitious comic book story that takes many dramatic liberties in plot and characterization while attempting to present the factual evidence of the murders.  First of all, Inspector Abberline is an opium addict who has shamanic visions of the murders that help him in his investigation, sort of a pseudo Frank Black profiler from Millenium.  While it is true that there were many opium and laudanum addicts at the time, it is used rather incredulously to create some depth to his character and a crutch to assist his unorthodox investigation.  We've seen Depp like this before in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Blow and is really no new material for Depp's repertoire as an actor although he does turn in a decent performance.  Secondly, Moore's slant is taken from one of many popular conspiracy theories regarding the ""secret society"" of Freemasonry.  The problem here is that Freemasonry is really not-so-secret but their ideology still remains obscured from those ""not-in-the-know"" and with good reason.  So what happens when you need a scapegoat to show an organization responsible for all of the sinister dark doings of society?  You guessed it... let's bring in the Masons!  Moore's audaciously dramatic theory does little more than create drama to support a rather slow moving plot and shows his ignorance of what Masonry is really all about.  The Masons are portrayed here as mere thugs in Mafia-like fashion to cover-up for the Royal Family's embarrassment of the Prince's affiliation with prostitutes... er, the ""Unfortunates""  since they are, after all, not of the English aristocracy.  Both in this film and the recent summer bomb Tomb Raider, Freemasons are portrayed as the villains who are responsible for the dastardly deeds of society and in both films are completely inaccurate depictions of what true Masonry is really all about.  Perhaps if Moore had ""enlightened"" himself regarding the true rites of Masonry he would probably have omitted this dramatically satisfying but preposterous theory when he first wrote his popular graphic novel.

7939017,4,B00005JKJM,"RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detectives interest.

The film was based on Alan Moores graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy, referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, theres no evidence that Abberline chased the dragon or that he had psychic visions. Speaking of real life, Moores graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.

From Hell plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970). From Hell even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society gentlemen in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammers Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.
