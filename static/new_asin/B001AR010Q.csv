3464666,2,B001AR010Q,"Did i really watch the same film as the previous reviewer??..my this Seagal vehicle is bad,what happened to the stylish fighter we once knew?
The fight scenes...showing Big Steve's gurning face and then cutting to the back of a 'double' who then does the actual fisticuffs,more Steve face pulling...more 'double' fightwork, Seagal is only ever shown in these scenes from the shoulders up.
I think these days the fight double should get top billing as with each passing film Seagal does even less,by this rate he'll need a stuntman just to get out of a chair, 'lose a bit of weight Steve,you don't convince at all anymore'.
The way the 'action' scenes are cut are annoying,the same punch shown numerous times,the same person hitting the floor as many...too much of the same,and it skips frames looking like they're using a teleporter..most odd and amateurish.
Don't get me wrong,i like the man,but he is plainly way too out of shape,he fights men half his age (and weight) and has never had a fist laid on him,taking the odd punch or messing up his shredded wheat hair would seem better.
You can tell he wrote it,his various ladyfriends in recent films have got so young its frankly embarassing.
He plays chauvenistic arrogant fool (along with his partner) which makes their characters unlikable..
Watch it and wonder where it all went wrong for Big Steve..",1217635200,3,1356,4.849137931034483
3464667,5,B001AR010Q,"KILL SWITCH

Written by Steven Seagal
Directed by Jeff King
Soundtrack composed by John Sereda
Rated: R

Starring:
Steven Seagal
Chris Thomas King
Holly Dignard
Karyn Michelle Baltzer

Distributed by First Look Studios

In childhood, Jacob King (Steven Seagal) witnesses the murder of his twin brother, Daniel. Traumatized by the event, it never stops haunting him.  As a result, he devotes his life to tracking down serial killers.  Renowned for having solved more cases than anyone else has in U.S. history, he becomes one of the most recognized and respected investigators in his field.

In Memphis, he and his police partner, Storm Anderson (Chris Thomas King), are on the trail of two vicious killers.  One is a psychopathic sex offender named Billy who brutalizes and tortures victims for the thrill of being chased by authorities.  The other is Vasquez, a deranged Zodiac killer who believes he can channel spirits and who leaves astrological symbols at the crime scenes.

Jacob battles both the killers and his inner demons in this film, and the case is compounded by the intrusion of a green FBI agent who is assigned to oversee it.

The Memphis setting is used to advantage, and John Sereda's bluesy soundtrack is perfectly suited to the mood. Suspense mounts as Jacob and Storm hunt the killers through the dirty South big city underworld of street crime and prostitution while the body count rises.

Issac Hayes plays the coroner, and even in this small role, adds much to the film.

Fans of Steven Seagal expect great fight scenes and they will not be disappointed in Kill Switch. The fights are lengthy and brutal. There are street fights, shootouts and a car explosion. Seagal is back in shape and handles himself well.

Kill Switch is listed as an action film but it is psychological horror at its best -- dark, suspenseful, with gothic overtones and often brutal violence. Seagal's writing skills are clearly apparent in this composition.

Production values are high; the movie has great clarity and the filming is somewhat stylistic with fast cutaways, fight scenes shot from different angles and certain dramatic moments highlighted in blue to add atmosphere. Kill Switch could have worked well on the big screen.

The cast overall turned in valid performances with those of Seven Seagal and Chris Thomas King nothing short of superb. They worked well together. In one of the film's lighter moments, Chris Thomas King steals the scene and viewers get a glimpse of his versatile and remarkable talent.

This is somewhat of a departure from Seagal's previous movies, focusing more on plot and acting. Viewers see a different side of this martial artist, more humane and caring, but still capable of swift and deadly justice. Kill Switch is one of Seagal's best films to date, and firmly establishes Chris Thomas King as an important dramatic actor.",1214524800,16,2865,4.997894736842105

3464711,5,B001AR010Q,"Steven Seagal is going after two completely unrelated serial killers.  That is the story of this movie.  That is the ENTIRE story of this movie.  One guy he just takes a ball peen hammer and smashes the dude's arm over and over again.  And after he does that?  He goes, ""I think your arm's broken!""  So stupidly great.  That said, a lot of the action is godawfully shot to the point of hilarity, you can tell someone else is doing the fights for Seagal, and then right in the middle for a split second they'll cut to Seagal just standing there as nothing happens, like he'd only shoot a couple seconds of him looking like he was about to fight, and then went ""okay just cut that in between my stunt man doing all the work.""  Seriously, you never seen Seagal's face during any actual fight scene, except for those really quick cutaways when nothing is happening.",1359244800,3,861,4.439490445859873
3464712,5,B001AR010Q,"Kind of like Michael Jackson's life, you may find it alarmingly suspicious that any one man could have this many rumors and speculations about him without actually being guilty of something in some way.

When you think this, youll still doubt that everything was O.K. about Steven Seagal; its Steven Seagal. You like him; you hate him because it's just not normal to have this much mystery surrounding one human life.

Blah, blah, every perfect individual can throw a stone.

3464714,1,B001AR010Q,"The DVD and packaging was fine, but the storyline and the acting was not Seagal's best work. There were two story-lines one about a bomber and another about a serial killer, but they were unrelated. Story moved slow and ended weird. First time I noticed that there were a lot of beat 'em up action scenes that really didn't do anything except over-punish the bad guys. (They kept getting up and Seagal would punch them down again.) Also, I noticed that you rarely saw Seagal's face doing the action... like there was a double doing most of his martial arts.",1350518400,,557,4.58

3464716,2,B001AR010Q,"I have read many reviews of Seagal's DTV releases, and I have seen some of the movies, including this one. The main problem, as I see it, is that you can't hear what he is saying. He mumbles instead of speaks. I don't know about anyone else, but if I am watching a movie and the actor says something, I want to be able to hear what he says without having to turn the volume WAY UP first. I bought this movie, and watched it once, but I'm not sure if I will watch it again. I think if they could just work out the SOUND problems, they would come a long way in making his latest DTV releases more watchable.",1321920000,,605,4.008264462809917
3464717,3,B001AR010Q,"Thought this was one of the better written DTV releases from Seagal that I have seen yet.  The story was quite interesting and even reminded me of Glimmer Man a little.  If it was not for all the voice dubbing I would have given it a 4 star review.  Seemed like nearly half of the movie his voice was altered, which was a turn off along with some of the fight scenes were one of them dragged on nearly 15 minutes.  I realize Mr. Seagal is busy but if he is going to make movies it would be nice to see him do all his own work vs. the body doubles and voice alterations.  Outside of that, pretty decent movie.

3464719,1,B001AR010Q,"Wow this was bad. This is the first time I've felt compelled to post a review for a movie, that's how bad it was.  A porcine Seagal, complete with some kind of odd southern accent.  Obvious stunt double.  Gratuitous fight scenes that go on forever with Seagals innumerable punches and kicks seeming to have no affect on the bad guys.  Cut and jerk stop motion photography.  Inexplicable ending that seems to have been inserted as an after-thought.  Just a bad movie from start to finish. Kind of like the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of the action movies.",1316304000,4,552,4.581632653061225
3464720,3,B001AR010Q,"ok, i'll put SPOILER ALERT but really, watching the end scene to this was one of the most unnerving experiences of my entire life. it's like the film ended but then a special seagall-cam actually took us inside the fat one's head and showed us his inner fantasies. he appears at the door of this house and there is this lovely young woman with two children and an older woman. who are they? good question. at no point have they appeared in the film up until now or even been mentioned. the children are dressed similarly to the children in fatso's recurring memory flashback but they're not white like the flashback children, one's chinese and one's indian!!! why? how? eh? then the children are given a present and disappear with, the housekeeper? their aunty? stevo's mother-in-law??? next thing, horrifyingly, the lovely blonde who i'd assumed must be his niece turns out to be, errrmmm, somebody he's about to have sex with anyway. god, by this stage it's as bad as walking in on your mum and dad having sex when you were young if your mum had somehow not aged at the same rate as your dad. all the time seagull has his constipated smile on his face:he is indulgent towards this performance. one small mercy, the door is closed before the full on passion starts.

I happen to be a huge Steven Seagal fan. Sad, I know, but this movie was actually relatively good considering what he's been putting out lately. Don't expect a lot and you'll be pleasantly surprised. If you watch this expecting ""Under Siege"" or ""Above the Law"" then you'll be disappointed. I've seen most of his movies and this is far superior to a few others he's done in the past. If you're considering it, my advice is to give it a chance.",1312329600,2,510,4.368421052631579

3464723,3,B001AR010Q,"The stunt double sucked, but it is NOT as BAD as the stunt double from Black Dawn!!! The only part where the stunt double is painfully obvious is the fight sequence at Mojo Blues. This problem can be solved by pressing FFWD. The rest of the film is decent. The trailer from SPIKE TV makes this movie look awesome, but it is only mediocre. The dubbing is annoying at times, but die hard Seagal fans should be used to it by now. The final fight against Billy Jo appears to be all Seagal. True Seagal fans should recognize Billy Jo from Fire Down Below (Mark Collie). It was just as COOL to see Seagal vs. Collie again just like Seagal vs. Trejo.

Overall this movie is like a 2.75 out of 5. Seagal does kick a lot of @ss in this movie. Issac Hayes made a nice cameo in this film. Two things are guaranteed in any Seagal movie: 1) Seagal kicks @SS and he is omnipotent and 2) Really really HOT women!!

The two hot chicks in this movie made it worth a look. Holly Dignard (Frankie Miller), and Karyn Michelle Baltzer (Celine) are both smokin HOT babes!!! I also love Anna Mae Routledge (Librarian) and Ali Liebert (Bartender @ All About Eve). Awww man! She is so sexy!!! I love Ali Liebert!!!

So, if you are a fan of Steven Seagal and you enjoy the eye candy of hot chicks, you will like Kill Switch. If you didn't like Kill Switch, then ... I'ma stick my size 14 up yo @SS!!!

And the fight scenes were so far over the top, they were unbelievable. Not only does one of the two serial killers in this film get thrown for a 4th story window and survive with no major injuries, only to go on killing, the fight scenes were edited using ""replay"" (repeat of blow or impact 3 or 4 times). After the first couple of times, you want it to stop-- desperately. Also, the end of the movie is edited so that key information is left out. The ending makes absolutely no sense at all to viewer.",1278115200,,642,4.270491803278689

3464728,4,B001AR010Q,"This movie is worth 5 stars because of the hot brunette FBI Agent Frankie Miller (Holly Dignard)!

I have to give a 4-star rating because of the plot and production. Most of the movie is just one whirl of disconnected suspense about how one maverick cop (Seagal, of course) tries to fit clues to find 2 serial killers on the loose. Some scenes are just too abrupt and don't flow with the movie: eg. how and where did FBI Agent Miller land up entering an apartment of a man who was threatening his woman with a weapon? One minute Agent Miller has just walked out of a crime scene and the next scene shows her and another female cop in an already opened doorway confronting the armed man. You should see how swift this sexy FBI Agent disarms her potential attacker with ease without sweating her waxed eyebrows - she moves faster than Seagal! LOL!

Zoom or pan out the camera, Steven Seagal.
Your fans want to see your fancy footwork and hands, and how they move in relation to a takedown.
How about I produce a movie with you next time?

3464729,3,B001AR010Q,"Kill Switch (2008) is a gritty and edgy thriller set in Memphis, featuring Steven Seagal as Jacob King, a police detective on the trail of a pair of psychotic killers.  Bille Joe Hill (Mark Collie) is a sadistic nutcase who enjoys using a knife.  Lazereus (Michael Filipowich), is deeply into astrology, the occult, and heavy metal.  Hidden in the shadows, driven to kill by inner demons, he is the serial killer known as 'the Grifter'.  With FBI agent Frankie Miller (Holly Dignard) poking around, King has his hands full.  In one of his last film appearances, the late Isaac Hayes adds some class and humor, as an overtaxed coroner.

Seagal's films are often the subject of harsh criticism, and while Jeff King directs, Seagal can be held to account more than usual, as he did write the screenplay.  The film moves along pretty well, but there are some problems with the fight scenes.  Some of the action sequences may produce dizziness or eye strain, due to the frequent use of a technique where the same event is shown several times.  This repeat view technique, combined with the usual quick cutting, use of doubles, insertion of Seagal's face, and changing of speeds, leads to some disjointed looking scenes.  One fight in a bar seems to go on forever.  This is followed by an extended, poorly executed gunfight in the street.  Things like this, detracts from the general enjoyment of the film.

Besides agent Miller, Seagal has written in a number of females for his character to interact with.  Karyn Michelle Baltzer is Celine, a police officer whose role in King's life is not spelled out, though she is often in King's home wearing a robe.  Daniella Evangelista is a lovely barmaid, who somehow winds up pinned to a door.  Exotic Anna Mae Routledge, plays a librarian who crosses paths with Hill, and meets an unknown fate.  And Andrea Stefancikova makes a brief but revealing appearance as King's better half.

Kill Switch has a dark and heavy atmosphere.  Seagal's screenplay has a hard edge, with lots of brutality, including the hammering and breaking of bones, surging arterial flow, psychotic killers, and a number of women getting slashed.  With King actually doing some half decent detective work, and a pretty good cast, this is probably one of Seagal's better direct to video projects.",1257897600,9,2306,4.864102564102564
3464730,4,B001AR010Q,Kill Switch is another DTV starring Steven Seagal (who also wrote) as a Detective investigating a series of grisly murders. It's got a good plot kinda Seven-like but with alot more action. I only have a few complaints being the Seagal fan i am. His double is too noticeable and the quick cuts. These and the ending are the only downfall. All in all this is a good movie it has it's high points but i liked Driven to Kill much better.,1244160000,8,433,4.2926829268292686
3464731,3,B001AR010Q,"It's been quite awhile since I saw my last Steven Seagal film, so maybe that's why I enjoyed Kill Switch a little more than most other viewers.  Watching bad guys pay a heavy price for their crimes falls under my definition of entertainment, and Seagal just absolutely beats the crap out of any loser dumb enough to get in his way - and he doesn't waste any time getting down to business.  In the opening scene, some sicko has wired explosives to a woman's chest, and the bomb squad has only a few minutes to figure out which wire to cut.  Somehow knowing that the perpetrator is watching from a room across the street, Seagal's character bursts in on him and subjects him to some rather intense interrogation.  It's just a foretaste of the violence to come later in the movie.

The story, which Steven Seagal wrote himself, isn't all that bad - especially given the pretty obvious fact that parts of that story didn't make it into the studio's final cut.  The product description, for example, describes Seagal's character, Detective Jacob King, as ""one of the most celebrated homicide detectives in the country.""  That certainly didn't come through in the film; as far as I could tell, he was just a Memphis detective (with perhaps the weirdest pseudo-Southern accent I've ever heard) who tends to go into rogue mode during his investigations but always ends up getting his man.  There also seem to be some holes in the subplot involving the less important of two murderers, but it's the ending - unexpected and potentially confusing - that strongly suggests that you the viewer are correct in thinking you must have missed something pretty important earlier in the film.

Of course, you don't watch a Seagal film for the storyline; you watch it for all of the butt-kicking action sure to come your way.  If the plot holds together in any sort of concrete manner, that's just a bonus.  (Speaking of bonuses, Kill Switch also features the great Isaac Hayes - playing a coroner - in one of his final film roles.)  Kill Switch definitely serves up plenty of action, as Jacob has to go through a lot of different people to get his hands on a serial killer before he claims another victim. Subplots come and go (and I must say the inclusion of Holly Dignard as an FBI special agent sent to observe and evaluate Jacob's rather unconventional style of crime fighting is one that was never truly developed), but Seagal's action scenes (with or without a stunt double) are still worth the price of admission.",1241308800,2,2501,4.684931506849315
3464732,2,B001AR010Q,"This movie is a prime example of quitting long before your time is up.

Seagal's Movie KILL SWITCH is damn near impossible to watch for a number of reasons:

* Crappy Editing, I don't know whether this was done on purpose or someone had a bad day but this is by far the worse editing job on a Seagal movie that I've seen anyway. Like someone else said the close-up shots of his face during the fight scenes didn't cut mustard with me.

* The action sequences were, at best mediocre, his Martial arts skills are a joke in all his 21st century movies, and his gun skills are even worse, firing guns at people that he can't even hit.

Anything before 2000 was much better, Under Siege I & II, Out For Justice, On Common Ground, Hard To Kill.....I'd pick any of these over this one any day.

3464735,2,B001AR010Q,"The story: Jacob King (Steven Seagal) is a legendary Memphis detective who may have met his match in his latest suspect. After taking down the prostitute-murdering serial killer Billy Joel Hill (Mark Collie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Down-Below/dp/6304707622/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Down Below</a>), he finds himself hunting Lazereus (Michael Filipowich, ""Charlie Jade""), an astrology-inspired mastermind and murderer working his way through the city's seedy underbelly, targeting both men and women for some unknown purpose.

The Seagal-penned plot feels very incomplete and half-minded: it's never revealed why Lazereus kills people or what his fascination with astrology is, making me think that he's simply a rip-off of the Zodiac Killer. In addition, the murderer Billy Joel Hill has a really weird role in the movie: he's taken out by Seagal early in the film and sent to court, but manages to dodge punishment and promptly kills his attorney and slaughters a couple of people in the background until showing up at the end of the picture for a final round with Seagal. This, after having contributed minimally to the storyline and having a screentime of less than five minutes. I know I'm nitpicking, but shouldn't the character who shares the final showdown have some greater signifigance? It really feels like he was just stuck in there because the ending would've been a lot less dynamic otherwise.

Onto more positive things... While not a high point for Seagal's DTV career, his supporting cast is largely a good one. Holly Dignard (""Whistler""), Chris King (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-Brother-Where-Art-Thou/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>), Mark Collie, and the late Isaac Hayes do their best with their roles and do a good job of building up the hero (Filipowich's performance remains questionable, but then again, it was a silly part to begin with). Seagal's performance is kind of strange: though he gives the same soft-spoken act as always, he's chosen to give Jacob a Deep Southern drawl that occasionally fades away. At first, I thought I was listening to a dubbed voice again, but apparently Seagal does his own lines throughout the film, making it the first time that he's attempted a legitimate accent since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>.  Though this doesn't really add or detract from the movie, it's cool to see Seagal caring enough about a character to make an effort.

While we're talking about ""Out for Justice"", I might point out that this is probably his most violent film since that '91 classic: from breaking a thug's ribs with his punches alone, to the vicious assault on Lazereus with a hammer, to the gruesome and stomach-churning teeth-in-table scene, ""Kill Switch"" is a turn for the brutal in Seagal's action performances...even though the fights themselves are a turn for the worst. Though Seagal's character employs the most aggressive fighting style of any of his personas (e.g. at one point, he lifts Hill up bodily and slams him against the wall like a pro wrestler), it's never been clearer that a stunt double is doing the work, to the point that the real Seagal is lucky if he's seen landing a single punch. He takes more damage in this movie than usual, but the camera tends to cut away so you don't really see him being thrown through a table or getting kicked in the ribs. Most annoyingly, the movie cultivates a bad habit of replaying every punch/kick/throw numerous times in rapid replay; this is best witnessed early on in the film, when we see the rerun of Hill being thrown through the same window a legitimate eight times.

Still, it feels good when the bad guys get their comeuppances by Seagal, and in the end, that's almost enough. The storyline isn't convoluted or watered down by too many subplots, and the editing looks good. Unlike his earlier DTV attempts that went all over the place, ""Kill Switch"" seems firmly tied down. The problem is that there is not much to tie, and what's there is isn't backed up well enough. I'd put ""Kill Switch"" on the same level as films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Submerged/dp/B00083FZEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Submerged</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mercenary-for-Justice/dp/B000E6ESD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mercenary for Justice</a>, so if those movies didn't scare you off, give this one a peek.

3464737,1,B001AR010Q,"Ouch this was bad...........

The story premise started out pretty good, the film production had a professional look........ BUT....... that is where the good news stops.

Everything else about this film was horrible and destroyed the potential this had to be a good film.

For example...

1) What was with the choppy editing ?  This over-used visual effect is annoying. We see the scene chop-edited end to end like a skipping record. A guy get thrown out a window and we see him break thru the glass - thru the glass - thru the glass - thru the glass in rapid succession.
Almost every action scene uses this edit.

2) Did any of you notice that Steagal was NOT involved in any of the action scenes ?
A double was used for all the action/fight scenes and they edited in still shot close-ups of his face every 10 seconds to 'trick' the viewer into thinking it was Steagal... but it was very obvious as they kept using the same 3 relaxed facial shots over and over regardless of where he was located in the room, background, or what position he was in during the fights.

3) What was that accent ?  Cajun meets the Godfather ?
it was so forced and faked that my wife and best friend watching the movie started laughing so hard they begged me to turn off the movie because they couldn't stand it any more.

Steagal has certainly had some good films (UNDER SIEGE near the top) and some of his Direct to Video movies have been good entertainment.......... but Kill Switch was simply horrible ---- Although it COULD have been good if it was done seriously and not treated in a comical, campy manner that made it silly to try and watch.

We gave up 50 minutes into the movie and ejected it.... we could not take any more.",1231113600,2,1714,4.412698412698413
3464738,3,B001AR010Q,"It's interesting to note the very even rating distribution for Kill Switch. As most Seagal fans know Seagal's had big screen days but now is in the Direct-to-Video (Direct-to-Download) days. Kill Switch is nowhere near as good as some Seagal earlied big screen flicks such as Above the Law, Out For Justice, or Under Siege. However it doesn't come close to the horrors of The Patriot, The Foreigner or other very lame DTV efforts.

Kill Switch had a different feel from most other Seagal films. It was more of a Thriller but still had a lot of action. The production quality was decent. Unfortunately Seagal's mumbling makes it difficult to understand what he's saying. Also the fight scenes were filmed/edited in such a way detracting from what were some decent fights.

The one other bad thing about Kill switch was the somwhat convoluted plot and subplot. The main plot involves the search for a serial killer. The subplot involves the escape of a killer whom Seagal's character had caught. Another distraction was Seagal's character's numerous flashbacks to his childhood. Finally there is a totally bizarre ending in which Seagal leaves his job in Memphis and ends up going 'home' to a wife and two kids in some Spanish speaking country. To top it our man Seagal has to throw in a little gratuitous sex (his wife flashing her breast and enticing him into the bedroom) to close the film...totally bizarre way to end an otherwise decent film.

For a Seagal film I'd give this 4 stars. It's actually a 5 star Seagal direct-to-video film. However for the purposes of Amazon I give it 3 stars.",1229126400,2,1593,4.785454545454545
3464739,1,B001AR010Q,"Well, I just sat through ""Kill Switch"" a film so poorly done, the main character can't even be sure if he's Jacob King or Jacob Stillwell (see prior reviews).  It is a shame that Steven Seagal has gotten so out of shape, and resorted to stunt doubles to take his place in the fight scenes, since his earlier films were certainly enjoyable as action films (""Above the Law"" and the ""Under Seige"" films in particular).  Despite the inconsistency of his direct-to-video output, I had continued to hope for some quality in either plot or action.  Alas, no such luck here.

The editing is atrocious, with jump cuts that make each fight scene headache inducing.  The logic of a detective beating each suspect within an inch of his life is as specious as the logic of the first killer surviving a push out a fourth story window to the asphalt below.  Even when you wade through the film, you're left with a closing sequence which makes no sense unless it was mistakenly edited into ""Kill Switch"" from another film.  Maybe that's the significance of ""Switch"" in the title; perhaps this was actually a preview of his next film, which features naked Russian starlets seducing Steven.  And Memphis looked a lot like Vancouver, where the film was shot, which was at least better than Romania or Slovakia.

The other negative reviews have covered most of this, but I do have to mention one point of interest.  The dialogue is difficult to understand in places, so I switched on the sub-titles.  Amazingly, in a number of places, instead of explaining the difficult-to-understand lines, the subtitles state, ""Inaudible,"" or ""Audio.""  Even the post-production crew couldn't understand what was said, and apparently lacked a copy of Steven's script!

3464743,5,B001AR010Q,"We believe October is the time to get in as many horror films as possible. As the weather cools down and jack-o-laterns burn on peoples doorsteps there really is no better way to go. However there are times when you must make an exception, especially when you see an increasingly obese Seagal starring in a new realease. It's just a no brainer. In fact we were just having a discusion in hopes Seagal would come out with a new flick and within a week Kill Switch appeared. Judging by the 5 stars you may think ""Has Seagal finally turned his career back on track?"" Well the answer is no. He's still pumping out horrible films, but this one was so hilarious it could't recieve anything thing less then 5. The lines were tougher then ever, the dialogue more confusing then ever, and Seagal was fatter then ever. This is the only way we would break up the October horror fest for an action feature.

This one starts with a flashback of two twins playing hide and seek at a brithday party while some freak hiding out in the woods watches. This guys looks like he stepped off the set of To Catch a Predator and is on the run from Chris Hansen and the cop dressed up like swamp thing. He eventually catches one of the twins and kills him while the other one watches. Now fast forward to current day where you learn the living twin is Seagal who still struggles with the murder by drowning himself in Jim Beam. He plays nation feared homocide detective Jacob Stillwell who is well known for his strong arm tactics, even if all his fights scenes are done by a stunt double. The first taste we get of his toughness is when he's called into a situation where killer Billy Joel Hill has stiched a bomb to a womans chest with about 2 minutes remaining before she explodes. Stillwell evaluates the issue and decides he must difuse the bomb by beating the tar out of Billy until he tells which wire to cut. He bursts into a hotel room where Billy awaits and they start to rumble. This fight scene is so funny. Seagal is throwing this guy into every wall of the room and then allows his stunt double to do all the intense brawling. Never before has a double been so obvious in a film. As stillwell rains down blows upon him he finally gets Billy to tell him which wire. Once the wire is clipped there is only 1 second left despite the fight scene lasted for about 5 minutes. To seal the scene Stillwell kicks the killer out of a four story window where he lands on his face, yet survives. Hey it's a Seagal film so anything can happen.

After a long day Stillwell heads home where his cop partner/love interest awaits looking to get it on only to get shut down (Yeah thats realistic). He needs to continue his work to find a killer known as Lazereus and heds down to the morgue to meet up with his coroner buddy Issac Hayes. We can only hope this wasn't Issacs last performance. Once at the morgue another body turns up appearing to be a victim of Lazereus. As Stillwell and Issac Hayes try to crack the case we noticed a microphone hanging down in plain view. One of the best moments in the movie. It was in 2 shots then disappeared in the third so we knew it was a complete mistake. Big star for the editor on this one. As Stilwell and his partner continue on they get hot on the trail of Lazereus but he continues to get away and the bodies continue to pile up. While he gathers clues to stop the next murder he finds out Billy got released which bring him one step closer to his massive heart attack. Finally he cathces Lazereus in a bar and gives him the beat down of a life time sending him to prison. Once he heads home he sees his lover dead from stab wounds by the hands of Billy. As he turns to hit the door Billy jumps at him for round 2. But it's a Seagal flick so you know what happens. He rips the guy to shreds then kills him leaving a note behind saying he was done. Seems he made peace with his inner demons and will retire to only get even bigger.

Kill Switch has recieved awful reviews but we just loved it. It wasn't good by any normal movie sense but from a b standpoint it was pure genius. The fight scenes were the funniest we've seen from Seagal in a while. It seems like the stunt double is in the film as much as he is. For anyone who wants to sit back with some friends, a couple pizzas, a gang of brews, and laugh all night then this one's your vehicle baby. It'll take you anywhere you want to go.",1224806400,10,4411,4.230130486358244
3464744,1,B001AR010Q,"This is one of the funniest terds I have ever seen. Big fat bloated black frizy haired Steven Segal is a sadistic cop who beats serial killers half to death to see them  up and walking around the next day without a scratch or even a little soreness. They shoot the fight scenes in that herky jerky hand held technique that is popular thesed days and annoying as heck. I believe they use this technique cause fatty isn't as quick as he use to be. And as bloated as he is I am pretty sure that they shoot one motion or maneuver at a time cause he has to get severely out of breath and probably sweats like a big fat swine in a black leather trench coat. Segals fight scenes in his old movies, when he was young and slim with greasy hair and a pony tail were lightening quick and didn't last long. Fatty Segal beats the hell out of these guys for about 20 minutes at a time. He smashes them, throws them thru furniture, walls and objects, breaks their bones and even throws them out 3 or 4 story windows. Then the next day or a few days later they don't have a scratch and there is no visible evidence that they have even broken a fingernail. Fatso must punch like a girl because he pounds these evil monsters a million times and they still keep getting up.

Chubby also has an Asian girlfriend or something who is constantly in a state of undress trying to seduce him. But his cholesterol and girth must have impeded his blood flow to his sexual organs because he is completely disinterested and never gives the little hotty the time of day. Then for some unknown, unexplained reason in the end he walks into a house in Russia and what we can assume is his hot 20 year old Russian wife greats him with their kids and then strips off her clothes revealing a Playboy centerfold like hardbody and this big fat bloated black boot polished head budda is all over her and it is disgusting.

My theory is that they didn't pay Segal with money they only had to have a young hot naked chick in the movie that he could molest cause the scene made no sense, was never explained and had nothing to do with the movie.

Segal is the man! I have rarely laughed harder or longer making fun of a movie. He is fat. He is old. He is washed up. He has Kiwi shoe polish in his frizzy hair and he has his ever present black leather tent on to cover up his big old fat belly and he still has the guts to get a hot chick that is 40 year younger then him and naked to make out with him. She obviously was warned not to eat a big meal before the scene so she would not risk vomiting in Segals mouth while kissing him and the slobber that ran out of his jowells when he saw her naked was only less creepy by the fact that you know that there is no possible way that he could be possibly aroused do to his horrible phyical fitness.

Funny FUNNY FUNNY movie! Watch it. Love it. Enjoy it!",1224633600,5,2856,4.138738738738739
3464745,3,B001AR010Q,"The career of action film star Steven Seagal has had enough ups and downs to appear like a rollercoaster ride in one of any hundred theme parks across the country. Beginning in 1988 with ABOVE THE LAW, Seagal  burst upon the scene as a martial arts master in a film that featured plot, good acting and enough action that involved non-hand to hand combat to keep audiences screaming for more.

With each new film, Seagal developed more mystery about his personal life, played roles that were a little deeper and eventually was able to parlay his clout to make films that followed items dear to his heart. Unfortunately the more he did so, the smaller the crowds to his films.

In recent years Seagal's films have taken on that dreaded identity of direct to DVD features, movies that play in either no theater or limited run. This doesn't mean that the quality is lacking all the time, just that the studio behind it has less faith in the films than Seagal does. So he has kept making them knowing fans would show.

Fans support him enough that a book has recently been released, SEAGALOGY: A STUDY OF THE A** KICKING FILMS OF STEVEN SEAGAL by Vern, a contributing writer for the ain't it cool news web site. The book covers Seagal's films from beginning to end. But I'm not sure that it included the newest release, KILL SWITCH.

Seagal plays Jacob King, a detective working in Memphis, TN, and hot on the trail of a serial killer. The film opens on a case where a psycho has implanted C4 explosives in a young woman's chest with a timer set to go off in minutes. Confronting the killer, King beats a confession out of him in time to save the girl while inflicting enough damage to require medical support for said killer.

The scene moves to another serial killer on the lose, this one having wracked up 4 bodies to date with one on the way. Using astrological signs and leaving clues to what he is up to, including a coded cipher, King attempts to figure out his prey and take him off the street.

Due to his handling of the last killer though, King now has an FBI agent hot on his tail, Agent Frankie Miller (Holly Dignard). Suspicious of King, raw to the ways of the street, she finds herself at odds with him non-stop. While commanded to co-operate, King does his best to find the killer at the cost of relations with the FBI.

The clues mount up as does the body count. And when the first killer is released due to the coercive tactics of King, he ends up dealing with both killers before the films end.

The movie offers a decent plotline, written by Seagal himself. The action sequences fluctuate between dynamic and lame. Seagal is best when he does all of the work himself, including stunts. Fight sequences where an obvious stand in takes his place seem weak while the scenes with Seagal facing the camera and doing the moves he's made famous bring a reality to it. One has to wonder why this is. With the abilities there, why resort to unfit replicas?

One of the bad things involving the fight sequences is the use of what seems to be hiccup cutting of scenes. The same shots pushed back to immediate back, fast cuts of repeated blows and a close up shooting of intimate fight scenes that were my biggest complaint in the mega hit  BOURNE films. Back off and let us see the action!

Seagal's acting has been worse and better. He coasts along easily as King, using a Cajun style twang to make him seem different than usual. And King's secret past leads one to suspect that perhaps he isn't who he seems.

The other actors range from an even keel to some of the worst one line roles seen. Unconvincing would be the nicest way to put it. But all in all this movie is not the terrible film that some seem to think. And if you're a Seagal fan, you should be pleased.",1223942400,18,3773,4.4271284271284275

3464747,1,B001AR010Q,"Perhaps by the end of this review you may feel that I am a Seagal hater, I am not. I can easily sit and enjoy all of Seagal's Warner Brothers outings and Half Past Dead and have purchased and enjoy repeated viewings of a good number of his DTV output including Belly Of the Beast, Out Of Reach, Mercenary For Justice, Shadow Man, Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped. Which brings me to a certain point, after Urban Justice especially and also Pistol Whipped it looked like Seagal was making an effort to listen to his fans and make amends for the terrible quality of Flight Of Fury and Attack Force but that does not seem to be true. With Don E Faunt and Roel Reine as directors, Seagal simply seems to have gotten lucky with a few good above average DTV's.  I think it is obvious that Seagal does not care at this stage that he is voice dubbed in his films, he knows where the money is made on these DTV releases and that is in non English speaking countries where Seagal is dubbed into the local languages anyway so why should he care. His acting if anything is even worse now than it was in the 90's which only verged on the passable. Seagal simple does not have any understanding or probably it's that he doesn't care about the craft of acting. I have purposely made this a long review as Kill Switch will be my last Seagal outing as I have had enough of these poor quality DTV's and Seagal blaming everyone around him for them being so terrible so I felt that I needed to get it all out of my system in this review. I'm sure all the Seagal fans who believe Seagal can do no wrong will be upping the 'was this review helpful to you' numbers in the negitive, that is if they could be bothered reading my review in the first place.

Lets begin by clearing something up, like another reviewer D.J Hooson stated, I don't know what film ""Joan Turner - writer, editor and publisher"" saw called Kill Switch that deserved a 5 star rating but it could not have been this embarrassment starring Steven Seagal. This DTV outing is just a mess and the last straw with these Seagals DTV's, the man just does not care what cr*p he makes so long as there is a pay cheque in it for him at the end. To get into the negatives straight away, the film is very dark, Seagal is voice dubbed for roughly 80% of his lines, his fight scenes are 90% doubled with quick cuts to Seagal's face every few seconds. The editing of this film is just terrible sometimes repeating the same shot up to 10 times from different angles. Seagal wears the same long black coat throughout the entire film, he has yet again another love interest barely in her 20's, he calls his male police partner 'Baby' on several occasions, and address' females in this film as 'Man', has Seagal become gender confused! Also get used to hearing 'Lod have merca' as this is Seagal's new catch phrase. I propose to anyone renting this DVD, to really enjoy this film, get out the tequila and every time Seagal says 'Lod have merca' take a shot. Trust me; perhaps even you will be giving this a 5 star rating by the end, right Joan!

A few comments on Seagal's character as written by Seagal, remember Seagal is the sole credited writer on this so I feel justified in pointing the finger directly at Seagal on this occasion for the terrible script and dialogue. Seagal brutally assaults a suspect at the beginning of the film, I say Seagal, but I really mean Seagal and lots of help from his body double and voice double. Seagal kicks the suspect out of a six story window, which in my book could be considered attempted murder or at the least excessive police brutality, nothing happens to Seagal. Next up, Seagal's body double is put to work assaulting 3 seemingly innocent patrons in a bar who give Seagal some lip. Seagal now takes it upon himself, or rather his body double, to teach these boys a lesson. Then a shootout is up next in broad daylight with Seagal taking on up to 6 offenders. Seagal fires 50 rounds before he actually hits any of the bad guys who were no more than 20 feet away.  No media going mental over this rouge cop, no superiors coming down on Seagal suspending him while an investigation is conducted. Seagal then has a scene in a nightclub, spots a suspect on the opposite side of the dance floor and then proceeds to randomly assault almost every person on the dance floor to get to the suspect which then develops into a foot chase ending with the suspect running down an underground straight corridor chased by Seagal firing another 50 rounds and hitting everything except the suspect. Where are all the police complaints against this cop? Seagal is an expert martial artist, how exactly did the suspect get away from Seagal once Seagal catches him and they have a breif fight? Well because Seagal wrote it that way. There is also another bizarre scene Seagal wrote about a cannibal eating a clown which is just a joke story told to the FBI officer. Was this supposed to be funny?

On to the actual plot which makes little sense, there is a serial killer on the loose, the killer takes a girl a night yet the police put only two detectives on the case. Seagal is manually trying to break the killers code and refuses any help from the FBI agent assigned to the case. Some one should have told Seagal that the FBI have these things called super computers and a special branch of the FBI who's sole purpose is to break codes and there is a good chance it would have easily broken the serial killers code in a very short space of time given it's lack of complexity but instead, each night Seagal sit's at home rejecting the physical advances of his 20 something girlfriend and tries to break the code while yet another innocent girl is taken by the killer, Seagal doesn't seem to care about this at all. The show down with the serial killer in a bar at the end is just ridicules, I will not go into it any further for those who wish to watch the DVD but I'm sure you will notice the 2 innocent people who get shoot and killed because of Seagal. At this point a real cop I'm sure would arrest the serial killer and rush to the innocent civilians caught in the cross fire but not our boy Seagal, he doesn't care that these people just got killed because of him, instead he along with his body double spend the next 5 minutes kicking the cr*p out of the serial killer. Towards the end, the suspect kicked out the 6 story window in the beginning of the film turns up again, this time though our good cop Seagal takes justice into his own hands and murders the suspect in cold blood, I call it cold blooded murder because we all know Seagal is a martial arts expert, expert with weapons and knives and he can never be hit by anyone, this and the fact that Seagal basically tells the suspect, I'm going to kill you now. We need more cops like Seagal. But wait this is not the end. The last 5 minutes of this film make ZERO sense. I'm not even sure that it has anything to do with Kill Switch. All I can say about the last 5 minutes is what the hell?? All I kept thinking was that Seagal basically used his 20 something girlfriend for some purpose that is never explained and then, well you will see what happens. There is nothing likeable about Seagals character in this film and the best part is that Seagal wrote this thinking it was going to be a great film and my fans are going to love me in this. One last comment, how do we know that Seagal is doubled in the fight scenes, excluding the fact that the double looks nothing like Seagal. Well, the body double gets punched, kicked, knocked to the ground, gets hit by chairs, bottles and a few pipes. As we all know, the real Seagal would never allow this to happen to him.

The positives, Jeff King is not that bad a director, the DVD cover is the best Seagal has had for a while and to see the end credits felt like immediate relief from a 2 day throbbing tooth abscess.
