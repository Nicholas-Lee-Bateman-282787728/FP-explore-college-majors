8220331,5,B000VWYHY2,"What a wonderful DVD!!!

Ernie Hawkins is superb player. I am sure that any sensitive listener with a true interest in music will fully appreciate this DVD. This is a fine example of music trascending the limitations of genre and any notion of personal taste. If you love Music (Telemann, Ellington, Mingus, Lennon/McCartney, Rev. Gary Davis, etc.)you will not be indifferent to these amazing performances. Beautiful.",1276473600,,417,5.318181818181818
8220332,5,B000VWYHY2,"Although I don't enjoy the ""artistry"" DVDs as much as I do the ""instructional"" DVDs, this may be an exception.  As part of the atristry series, we have a warm, intimate performance, along with detailed explanations of the songs; as well as lively and inspiriting performances.

Yet, perhaps it is the teacher in Hawkins, he cannot ""turn off"" the instruction!  It is an instructional DVD, even though it may not have been intended to be so.

He speaks of his teacher, Rev. Gary Davis, in glowing yet realistic terms.  He admires his teacher without that silly worship that sometimes artists can fall into.

This is a terrific DVD.  Hawkins is a first rate player, has a fine singing voice, and it is almost as if we are invited into HIS living room for a private performance, great story telling, and great tips and insights into playing.

***** Star DVD for both enjoyment and education!",1230076800,2,887,4.714285714285714
8220333,5,B000VWYHY2,"A superb performance DVD, with Ernie's jawdropping picking showcased to full effect. Camerawork of interest to all players and the range of material is fabulous. Loads of interesting bio-info, much about Hawkins first meeting with Rev Gary Davis, and his friendship with that late guitar master. A highly recommended audio-visual treat.",1195516800,2,336,5.607843137254902
