1604676,4,B00005JPNO,"I saw a preview screening of Transformers at work last night, with the ILM folks who actually worked on the effects, and I have to say it actually was kinda rad. The visual effects and sound design were mindblowing.

Even the usual Michael Bay-isms of supermodel women as mechanics and enginerds, people outrunning EVERYTHING, slo-mo action of helicopters in the sunsets and and doofus secret government officials seemed to work just fine with the movie's subject matter. It added to the movie's popcorn fun mentality.

Shia's acting was endearing and believable, and almost John Cusack like. And as expected Jon Voight and John Turturro brought their own acting chops to the table. All in all, I loved the over-the-top action, the humor, the inside jokes, the special effects, the chilling sound elements and even the camp.

Hardcore fans need to loosen up. After all, Bay did get voice actor Peter Cullen to return to his role as Optimus Prime. In this film, there really is more than meets the eye.",1182988800,6,1001,4.876470588235295
1604677,4,B00005JPNO,"Year 2007 probably shall be remembered as the year of old favourites and sequels.  Many movies didn't seem to live up to their hypes such as Spiderman 3, Shrek 3.  It's only natural for me to be petrified to watch Transformers because it could probably be another dud.  However, having Steven Spielberg & Michael Bay as executive producers appease me somehow.  It's absolutely essential for Michael to get this one right to win back his credibility after his previous offering of The Island which flopped badly.  Who would have thought that robots inspired by Rubick cubes (thought up by Hasbro) and the Director who was inspired by Japanese manga would have come up with such a tight script that actually explained the who, what, how, why, where, and when of the Transformers without alienating new audience?  The action was trademark Michael Bay with beautiful angles, slow-motion, nice light, over the top heroic soundtrack, storyline of courage under fire, brotherhood, lots of explosives, big bang cars chase, subtle humour line, happily ever after ending where guy gets to drive fancy car and gets his girl too (more masculine based).  Enthusiasts would cheer that Optimus Prime is voiced by the original guy in cartoon whilst they would jeer at the fact that Megatron is completely modified to make it more sensible and that his presence is relegated to the second tier.  Enthusiasts would also cheer at the fact that the sound of transformation is included to give this movie a level of authenticity.  The star of the show would have to be the Transformers themselves and the special effect team does a very impressive job.  I'm sure that some of their works have been used for the Jeep's Compass ad.  The only downside of this movie is the over the top product endorsements and an opportunity for American car manufacturers to display their hardware.  The standout one would have to be BumbleBee-cum-Camaro, which happens to be the main character's guardian.  Yes, excellent cast all around and overall, a tidy package that deserves to be seen on the big screen.  For once, we don't have an open ended ending which for the moment rules out a sequel.  However, with Hollywood, if Sigourney Weaver can return from her grave to play Ripley in the Alien franchise, perhaps the same can be applied to this movie as well.  Highly recommended.",1182902400,,2345,4.89873417721519
1604678,4,B00005JPNO,"Writing reviews for something that hasn't been watched or read reflects rather poorly on the reviewers who fail to take the time to learn what it was which is being reviewed on.  There have been many interpretations of the Transformers mythos from Generation One all the way to Galaxyforce/Cybertron.  If one doesn't like a reinterpretation, just don't watch.  If one does wish to watch and give a negative review...at least be honest in knowing what is being written in based this particular movie.

While there have been few who have been able to see sneak preview showings of the film, I haven't been one of them.  The rating is PG-13 for ""intense violence, brief sexual humor, and language"".  The intense violence comes to no surprise considering the subject is an alien war waged here on Earth.  If the  other two subjects which are in the book  remain as such in the movie there's little call or justification for it.  Yes, the director wanted a ""matured"" look for the filmmaking.  However as in many movies today, including rated R movies, alot of marketing based on the movie is being geared towards children when they shouldn't be.",1182384000,2,1140,4.794871794871795
1604679,1,B00005JPNO,"Alot of people are expecting this to be great cause it's Transformers. This will be another blunderer from Bay make no mistake. Bay hasn't done anything good for over 10 years. Pretty much of the newer transformers series ,and toys have been disappointing. So this film and the cheap fungly bionicle look alike toys will share that same fate. Also none of the robots look like in the show. The Autobots will very much be background characters. Bumblebee will also be mute.  While Shia, Tyrese, and the other human actors will be more of the lead characters fighting the Decepticons. There's many robot characters that will be missing like Mirage, Sideswipe, Sunstreaker, Hound, Cliffjumper, Trailbreaker, Soundwave, Thundercracker, Skywarp, Laserbeak, Ravage, Rumble Reflector, etc. There's also no need for an untransformable desert storm Scorponok to be in it. Megatron will be much frozen like Skyfire until the last twenty minutes that he'll appear on the film only to be vaporized by an Indiana Jones like artifact cube that

Sam will throw at Megatron's chest to finish him off. Did I also mention that kingkong Megatron along his short twenty minute run will stomp on poor little Jazz that will be smaller than cartoon Bumblebee? Man they even got Jazz' size wrong. He's always been taller than Bumblebee. They even put Jazz' character to waste by immediately having Megatron destroy him. By the looks of it there won't even be a sequel film ,and if there is one it will be just as sorry as this.",1181088000,8,1503,4.913385826771654
1604680,5,B00005JPNO,"I've had this for a long while now, so I think it's time I update this review.  This movie is just fantastic, the transformation scenes were nicely done, and Shia and Megan were great.

1604681,1,B00005JPNO,"How can I put this sensitively?

The new ""Transformers"" movie is going to be a collassal waste of time, money, ambition and expectations. Of course the idea of the Transformers lends itself to being a great summer film, but the execution of what I have seen so far is insipid.

The robots look nothing like they are supposed to, the look of this film is more ""War of the Worlds"" (2006) mates with ""Bad Boys 2"" than Hasbro 1984, and once again Hollywood brings in annoying humans to be the center of attention, since a 2 hr film starring only the Transformers (the things we have actually paid money to see) would be too expensive to make. This way the animators do not have to perform anymore than what is expected of them, instead of being inspired to painstakingly create a real live action film of a beloved cartoon and toy series.

Every inch of film I have witnessed so far makes me gag and anyone who is truly excited about this film needs to check their expectations at the door. You are about to be as sorely disappointed as you were when you first saw ""Spiderman 3,"" and ""Superman Returns.""

Now lets bow our heads in a moment of silence...",1180224000,14,1149,4.431279620853081

1604917,3,B00005JPNO,"Transformer series had the potential to be so awesome!  And from a purely movie standpoint, this first Transformer movie was pretty good.  Unfortunately, Bay had to bring this franchise down with all the gratuitous lingering female body shots and stuff that adds no value to the movie.  We were able to watch this movie through the use of VidAngel, so we could filter out all of that stuff for our teenage boys who want a good action movie, but without the tempting visuals.  If not for the useless addition of that kind of trash, I would give Transformers 5 stars because the action is great and brings me back to my childhood watching the Transformers cartoons after school and Saturday morning.  In Transformers 4 and 5, there is less of the female oogling, but it's still there to some extent.  It's really too bad because these movies had great potential.",1513641600,2,860,4.7
1604918,4,B00005JPNO,"Is this reference quality, no. Is this still a great 4K transfer, yes.

There's a definite uptick in image quality (skin, clothes, cars etc) though nothing dramatic from the original 2K version. The biggest difference is the utilization of HDR and the wider colour gamut. The colours in the film are much more saturated and vivid and HDR provides an excellent contrast.

Dolby Atmos is a bit of a disappointment. The heights channels are used more to create immersive soundstage than for discrete sound. There were plenty of opportunities for this (overhead helicopters, gun fire, explosion etc) that weren't implemented. I guess I'm spoiled after the incredible Spider-Man Trilogy with Tobey Maguire Atmos track.

Overall great film and worth buying again.",1513296000,,757,5.239669421487603

I could go on and on about what I thought was great about this one but I will just say that this time, he really got all the elements right. It's a shame that the train derailed and never got back on track with the sequels but there still is this one, which can't be taken away from, no matter how many people that thought this was awesome when it came out but now like to lump it in with the others, so they can get on the ""let's bash all of them"" bandwagon.

The only thing I was disappointed with, was the fact that this is still not the IMAX cut of the movie. It's not really necessary though. It would just be nice to have the more complete version.",1512691200,6,925,4.049180327868853

1605098,4,B00005JPNO,"Transformers is brought by the director Michael Bay. He is well known for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.

Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes facedly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative sideward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this.

Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior enough. As fans have said, 'Michael Bay, you still suck but we still love you.'

Sure it has a crappy script and most of the issues in the sequels are in this. Mainly the Michael Bay tropes like the nasty ""humor"" & dehumanizing sexual shots of women. However it's much more toned down and restrained in comparison to the sequels. All the actors minus Megan Fox all do a solid job. Shia Lebouf and the comic relief are bearable. The robots themselves are properly built up and represented with respect for the most part. Optimus Prime isn't a horrible murdering, arrogant, authoritarian psychopath. It actually feels sort of like a Spielberg film in areas. It has that sense of wonder and mystique at times that is lost in the follow ups. The score by Steve Jablonsky is wonderful and the visual effects and sound design is always top notch in this series. It's a solid action film at best.

For the sake of Transformers fans, I hope Michael
Bay departs and we get a proper film with these characters because I have grown a sort of respect for it after watching the more recent cartoons, TF Animated and TF Prime.

1605497,4,B00005JPNO,"Let's not get carried away here. Transformers, while a somewhat fun summer blockbuster, it is not without its flaws. From its weird humor to its annoying characters (particularly Sam's parents) this movie does leave much to be desired in those areas. But enough of the flaws; let's get down to why it's one of the few Michael Bay movies that is not a total disaster. The Transformers themselves are exactly as they should be. The Autobots are heroic and fantastic, and the Decepticons are evil and tyrannical. The voice acting is exceptionally well done. Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are incredible as Optimus Prime and Megatron. I also enjoyed the human characters as well (most of them). Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Megan Fox, Jon Voight, and John Turturro are all really good in this movie. In addition, the visual effects in this movie are INCREDIBLE. The transformations are easily among my list of the coolest things ever seen in a movie. The CG animation looks more real than most of what we see in most Hollywood blockbusters. The action is intense and in-your-face, though there is a little too much shaky cam. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys summer blockbusters, because this movie is exactly that. However, this movie may not be the film fans of the original cartoon from the 1980s wanted to see.",1482537600,,1329,4.833333333333333

1606114,3,B00005JPNO,"This movie had a tremendous amount of potential to really shine as an outstanding Sci Fi action adventure fantasy equal to the likes of a ""X-Men"", ""Batman"", ""Terminator"", ""Star Wars"", & ""Conan"" franchises; but instead what we were given was amazing special effects mixed a ton of explosions, and an okay plot mixed with incredibly unlikeable if not dreadfully bad actors.

Michael Bay just loves constant action and explosion scenes, and his editing and cut scenes are physically nauseating.  If you seen Armageddon, this film, and Pearl Harbor you will see exactly what I am stating.

  The only character that does work is Angelina Jolie's father playing the role of the Secretary of Defense.  Looking back on this and watching it fully again some years later, I find Shia LaBeouf's character and performance to be really down right terrible and Megan Fox is only in this film for eye candy purposes alone.  Her skill and character bring virtually nothing to the table other than being a nice piece of a$$.

 The Australian character is placed in this movie for no real purpose, unless she was placed in this role to please the film maker's politically correct viewpoints, and the African American character I felt was also equally written terribly and he did nothing for the plot other than act as another person screaming at the shear site of those Decepticon villains.  PC talking points are deliberately thrown into this film to push the movie makers ideologies, and that right there really doesn't belong in a ""Transformers"" film at all, because we the audience don't need to hear them.

Later we find there is a secret agent government villain character who is so secret even the SECDEF doesn't know who he or his organization is.  This guy is fairly annoying, yet his part is played by a good character actor.  This actor is given garbage in terms of what this role provides, so that in itself was on the producers and not him directly.

 The movie seemed to like to indulge upon two subjects, secret hidden conspiracy theories and the film maker's political beliefs on government agencies clandestinely controlling average people.  This film started out with a good premise, but erupts into a senseless Michael Bay explosion and bomb special effects orgy of insane anarchy where the clarity of the CGI creatures is sometimes hard to make out, and the plot falls apart the longer the film reaches it's climax.

 If the filmmakers just stuck with the excellent original plot line both Marvel and Hasbro Toys came up with way back in the 80's when I was super young, where these awesome cartoons and action figures had great characters we loved, while also featuring a deeper philosophical joust between the ideologies that define goodness and those that many would say define tyranny and evil.

 The Autobots, through Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee, Grimlock, RC, Hot Rod, Wheeljack, and Jazz represent cyborgs who are actually soldiers for the forces of justice and decency in the universe.  The Decepticons, led by Megatron, represent warrior mercenary types who follow a political strong man, who leads them toward what they desire, violent conquest and theft of resources and planets.  The Decepticons need electronic energy, and Earth can provide them with that fuel, but instead of peacefully negotiating with human beings, they decide to fight and steal to gain what they want.

 Megatron represents a Ghengis Khan, and a Hitler/Joe Stalin style philosophy of military tyranny and a physically super strong man leader who nihilistically believes in a form of social darwinism where only the strong should survive through violence, hatred, and power.  But Prime represents the ideology that both freedom and right make physical might, not might making right.  Optimus Prime stands for more traditional Americanized ideologies of defense for those who are helpless, and strives for a system of impartial justice along with the desire to see most beings, be it cyborg and human alike, should be left alone to live out their lives in a form of peaceful freedom.  Prime doesn't believe in anarchy, but he also strongly opposes the ideals of military tyranny, particularly if that meant that the physically weaker human beings live as equals among his Autobot alien creatures of robotic physical advancement.

 The franchise itself has all the elements needed to make a grand action adventure drama, but in the end what we have is mindless CGI eye candy, mixed with a PC message, PC characters, mindless non-sensical explosions for no reason, and a few lightly sexually exploited characters who have the attractiveness but lack any real ethical character or brain power.

 So I can only give this a marginal grade of thumbs up for the delivery of sci fi action, but thumbs way down for everything else.  C+ for this movie.",1460764800,,4826,4.978802992518704

1606481,3,B00005JPNO,"I grew up in the eighties and nineties, and this cartoon was a favorite of mine.  I was invested in the story.  I even saw the cartoon movie, which was poignant, epic, and tragic.

I was surprisingly (yes, I am aware of Michael Bay's reputation) entertained by this film, but it didn't even have the depth of the cartoons.  Worse, he totally ripped apart the story, and not for the better, because in watching the whole series, I never thought the Autobots were secondary to the Decepticons.  Not to mention the complete bastardization of the way they looked, some sounded, and acted.

There were some hokey, embarrassing moments in the film.  (Really, why would you bargain for the erasure of a juvenile record that is by most states sealed?  Even in backwards Virginia.  So stupid, squeamish, saccharine, stereotypical, and even silly, and it weakened the strength of the characters.)  The film is still good entertainment, as long as you don't use common sense, question what you see, and didn't associate it with Transformers from the cartoon series.  Otherwise, you are expecting too much.",1445558400,,1094,4.923497267759563

There's not a bunch of bloody violence either which is refreshing.

1607014,4,B00005JPNO,"THE FILM: This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.

THE EXTRAS: Although Michael Bay movies are skin-deep when it comes to anything other than the visuals, they actually make for excellent home video releases because of those visuals, and a healthy amount of supplementary material. This particular Blu-ray edition has 2 discs. One has the main feature, which has optional audio commentary as well as a picture-in-picture option that provides additional behind-the-scenes information. The second disc has the rest of the material, subdivided into three sections and all in HD. The bulk of this is split into two multi-part documentaries that last a little under two hours total. ""Our World"" has interviews with the cast and crew and goes into pre-production, as well as stunts and a look at the many locations they shot at. This was actually the most impressive part for me, to see that they achieved quite a bit practically and in real locations, as opposed to sets. ""Their War"" goes into all things 'robot' and delves quite deeply into how the visual effects were conceived and achieved. However, as much as the visual effects were impressive and required tons of work, I wish a little more thought had been put into the characters. The last section, ""More Than Meets the Eye,"" is composed of a short featurette on the Skorpnok desert sequence, around 2 minutes of concept art and some trailers. Despite the shallowness of the product from a writing and character perspective, they more than made up for it with the amount of detail provided on all of the technical aspects of filmmaking.

OVERALL: This first Transformers movie is still my favorite, and for a couple good reasons. First, the magic is still there and all of the actors do their best given the absurdity of the material they were given to work with. Secondly, Michael Bay hadn't yet gone over the deep end with his pervy humor, and generally kept his baser tendencies in check (partly due to the PG-13 rating). As far as a Blu-ray release is concerned, they provided enough extra material for something labelled a ""Special Edition,"" even if most of it was largely concerned with technical matters. As a final thought, even though it was mostly addressed in jest, it was clear in some of the interviews that Michael Bay can be a difficult person to work with. He has his singular vision, and something will be added or changed if he thinks it looks ""cool."" As somebody who didn't really watch any of the cartoons consistently, nor play with the toys, I enjoy this movie well enough. It's not high art, but it does what it sets out to do rather effectively. And this 2-disc Special Edition Blu-ray is probably the definitive release for fans.",1436054400,8,4242,4.754409769335142

Ironically, it's not the Decepticons that could destroy the human race, it's really this movie:

Transformer's embarrasses me to be human, I'm sure someday satellite signals broadcast of this horrible Michael Bay Explosion-Fest will pollute an alien galaxy low on resources.  Normally the prime directive would prevent them from invading Earth and pillaging our plant, but this movie could be all the proof the high council will need to classify Humans as dumb livestock.

This movie is corny, predictable and insultingly dumb, it destroyed my childhood memory of Transformers.

Guaranteed to give you D0uce-chills.  If you don't know what that means look up Opie, Anthony and Patrice.

The best review of Transformers would be by the Amazing Atheist and his friend ""Gavin?"":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4tGycbFcLQ  (technically the review is for Transformers 2 but the movies are so predictable and dumb that the review would work for any movie in the series)",1418428800,,1015,5.414012738853503

I remember people saying when they first saw the trailers for this that they thought that it would be good but too cheesy. Do I have to say it? Good Lord, were they ever wrong! SPECIAL...EFFECTS....THAT WILL...BLOW...YOUR...MIND. I repeat: CGI that will destroy your brain! Be prepared to be blown away from the graphics, animation, and effects alone! I am 44 years old and I remember as a kid when Star Wars first was introduced in the 70's and how people were blown away by the effects. Battlestar Galactica was a good example in the TV category back then as well when it comes to ""decades ahead of their time"" technology. I went YEARS without feeling that sensation once Return of the Jedi left theaters. UNTIL this movie, Transformers, was introduced in the movie theaters.

1608385,5,B00005JPNO,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film, but I prayed for the best. When I first saw the previews over a year ago, I swore to everyone that I would see it during the sneak preview... and I did. I was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 1980's.

This is the ONLY film I have viewed in the theater more than once, (6 times to be precise). Normally, I am rather picky about dialogue and acting, which were sub-par at best in this film, but the action and special effects generously compensated for what it lacked. I was thrilled to hear the voice of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, and the personalities of the Autobots were dead-on!

As much as I loved this film, I was slightly upset that Jazz wasn't a Porsche like he was in the original series. I suppose the Pontiac Solstice was a close enough match. He did look pretty cool. I was quite impressed with the new image given to Bumblebee. He was, by far, my favorite character in this movie. Also, Megatron does not morph into a gun. I didn't mind that either. Even though it was great in the cartoon, it just would not have worked in a live-action film.

One thing, however, was way off: Devastator was a tank. Now, for those of you who remember the original series, Devastator was a giant robot formed by the Constructicons. The only tank in the original series was Warpath, who was an Autobot. I personally think Michael Bay could have done something different here, but for the sake of entertainment, it worked rather well.

Regardless of the discrepancies, I thought Michael Bay did a remarkable job with this film.",1411516800,,1584,4.395904436860068

1608632,3,B00005JPNO,"Looking back from 2014, it's easy to see most of the problems of Michael Bay's overblown Transformers film series were well in place in the first installment. It's harder to hate Transformers Number One, because those elements are slightly less prominent and in-your-face than the truly insidious second and third. Transformers is the closest in the series to a conventional movie, and deserves a converntional review, instead of the horrified warnings given about two and three. (and presumably T4) Far from being my own personal downward spiral like what follows it, Transformers has some good points, likely the result of producer Steven Speilberg reigning in Bay's more nihilistic tendancies.

Let's start with the good. It's signifigantly shorter than the two-and-a-half hour sequels, and all the more bearable for it. Characters, regardless of the fact that some of them dissapear halfway into the movie, have dialogue that isn't as cringe-inducing, and Shia's infamous n-n-n-n-no's are less annoying. Given that the actor's only job was staring in awe at special effects, they provide some reassureance tht you are indeed watching a movie and not a just peek into the maelstrom of CGI and pyrotechnics that is the directorial vision of Michael Bay. Simply put, the plot ""works,"" and that's all needs to be said on the matter.

The computer graphics are still impressive to look at today, and the cinematography is more reminescent of people using movie cameras, as opposed to jagged jumps from on scene to the next. Steve Jablonsky's militaristic score is typical modern action movie music; blasting horns and concussive percussion. Maybe viewings of Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon have damaged my memory, but the music seems far less loud in the first Transformers. The music isn't very memorable, but it fits. Transformers was a big movie with a fittingly bombastic score.

Transformers is not free of sign of worse to come, more recognizable after three sequels. The climax drags on for far too long, and the U.S. military is featured too heavily for a movie about giant robots from outer space. They don't serve much of a purpose other than to ineffectively empty their rifles at Megatron and company.

What it all comes down to is that Transformers is entertaining, even if it is nowhere near the best, if there is such a thing, of the ""mega-billion-dollar-action-extravaganzas"" Hollywood has been hurling onto the screen as of late. Armed yourself with some popcorn... and maybe the Riff Trax, and you a have a good addition to movie night, provided you aren't too picky about writing quality or strict continuity. Avoid the sequels at all cost, regardless of your enjoyment of this one. You have been warned.",1408838400,,2734,5.0554323725055434

1609215,4,B00005JPNO,"I know it's easy to bash Michael Bay, and he's even poked fun at his own reputation in some pretty funny credit card ads over the past few years, but I have to say that I usually enjoy the films he puts out...well ""Pearl Harbor"" aside, I should say that most of his films are packed with action and fun. And if I'm going to watch a movie about giant battling robots, I can't think of anyone better to be behind the camera.

I knew and know little about the ""Transformers"", I was never into the cartoon series, and couldn't tell you the difference between this series and the ""GOBOTS"" cartoon. I know some fans were upset with the changes Bay made the characters, but I didn't really have that baggage with me when I watched this film. So if you problem with this movie is that Bay altered characters or changed the basic storyline, then my review probably won't help you out.

As the movie opens we get a voice over narration from Optimus Prime, a leader of the Autobots (the good guys). He tells us that there is this cube that can create worlds, and that the Autobot's home planet was thrown into a devastating civil war over the cube. The leader of the Decepticons (the bad buys) named Megatron, tried to take control of the cube, so the Autobots sent is reeling away into space to keep it from falling into Megatron's hands. The cube spun it's way to space only to land on Earth, where it was tracked down by Megatron. Unfortunately for him, it landed in the Artic Circle where both he and it were frozen.

Flash forward to current times, and high school nudnick, Sam Witwicky is trying to save up enough dough to get a car. He plans on selling items that belonged to his grandfather, a famous explorer who was the first person to explore the Arctic Circle. One of the items he's listed on Ebay is a pair of spectacles which happen to have the coordinates of space cube's location. Sam gets caught in the middle of a race between the Autobots and the Decepticons to locate the cube.

""Transformers"" is a lot of fun. The special effects are top notch, and while I'm not a fan of excessive CGI, I don't think you could make this film with practical F/X. Technically, is amazing to look at. As wonderful as the images are, the sound is truly amazing in this film. If you have a great surround sound system, you are in for an audial assault!!

Shia Lebeouf is really fun as Sam Witwicky. Yes, I know it's the ""in"" thing to bash him right now, but I really like what he does in this movie. The comedy touches he brings to this character are a lot of fun, and he keeps the film grounded. Megan Fox looks great, and while she doesn't have much to do here, she does a good job with the material she's given.

I know that for some reason there has been a ton of backlash against this film series, and the people involved, lost in the mix is the fact that ""Transformers"" is just a really fun movie. Sure, it runs a bit long, and with editing, I think they could've easily chopped about 20 minutes or so out of the movie (for instance the blond systems analyst and her hacker buddy could've been completely taken out of the story and it wouldn't have affected the narrative), but I enjoyed the ride.

You may have been avoiding this movie because of the bashing, but I say give it a shot, and with the 4th film in the series getting ready to come out soon, this is the perfect time to catch up.",1403481600,,3387,4.3076923076923075

I am surprised it took as long as it did to get a movie on the big screen which exploited those toys.  After all, He Man was out in the 80s as was Strawberry Shortcake.  (The reason I bring this up is because my daughters played with them all.)",1401062400,,506,3.8737864077669903

1609314,4,B00005JPNO,"One of my several nerdy obsessions has always been the Transformers franchise. For some reason, I've always loved the idea of giant robots that turn into vehicles fighting each other over whatever. When I heard that they were coming out with a new theatrical film, I knew that I wanted to see it. Unfortunately, due to it's content, I was not able to in theaters.

Eventually, my family got a DVD player that cuts out immoral content (such as language, sexuality, etc.) called ClearPlay. This player allowed me to finally see this film. Once I did, I was pleasantly surprised.

The film's premise is very similar to what we see in most Transformers incarnations. The alien robots' planet has died, so they relocate to earth, where they continue to rage their war. In this movie, they are fighting over a giant cube called the ""Allspark"", which can give (or take) life to robots. It's plot isn't very complicated (or important for that matter), but it gets the job done.

What makes the movie are the action scenes and high-budget special effects. Seeing massive robots blow each other up is really cool, especially with the modern Spielberg effects. The action scenes are very thought out and are some of the most impressive scenes in film today (although they are beaten by its sequels'). Between the currently three films in the series, this one has the best blend of action and story, whereas the other two are more about the action than anything. In this case, however, it is a good thing. It's hard for me to watch an action movie when there isn't any real good plot to back up the fighting.

There are some negatives to the movie. The human characters aren't particularly interesting, and some of the acting isn't very good. Also, despite it referencing the series many times, the mature themes in the movie don't fit too well with the rest of the film. This is especially true considering that, similar to the G.I. Joe films (though not as bad), the dialogue is at times very similar to a Saturday morning cartoon.

What I should warn parents though is that, despite this film being based on a toy, this film is not appropriate for all audiences. The film has a lot of language and unnecessary sexual content. Micheal Bay really pulled out all the stops to make sure that this movie was designed for teenagers (particularly guys). It's a lot worse than movies such as Captain America or Thor, where the content barely makes the PG-13 mark. I would recommend using the ClearPlay DVD player I mentioned earlier (although it doesn't cut out Megan Fox's bad clothing). If you want your kids to watch a cleaner version of Transformers, check out the TV show Transformers: Prime (it's better than the movies anyway).

In the end, Transformers is a really enjoyable action flick. The dialogue isn't great and the story isn't anything spectacular, but the action scenes and special effects make it all worth it. Top that off with Transformers legend Peter Cullen returning to voice Optimus Prime, and you've got an enjoyable film that is sure to please most Transformers fans. Well... most, anyway.

I find having watched them all again that he does cover many important details but does it in his own way. He tries to make it adult friendly but I think that he tried to hard and the sex, drugs, have no real place with Transformers. He smothers it to much with those references. I fear for his interpretation of the TMNT. Some of the characters such as the twin bots in Revenge were just way to much on personality.

It didn't disappoint, so long as you understood that the Transformers wouldn't be the boxy robots of our youth, but rather a more wickedly-organic version meant to capture a more *realistic* tone. Would the 80's version have worked? Hmmm...

From the opening scene, with the backstory including the cube... I started my ""What happened to Energon? Where is the Ark in all of this?"" You simply have to take a very deep breath and remember you're watching a movie in the 00's, not a cartoon in the 80's.

It's an fun flick -- the kind you can re-watch, because the subtleties and twists are rare, but the action and story and characters are entertaining.

Funny thing, but I can't comment much on the extras. I remember there is an animated story to watch, but it's nothing special. This seems like the kind of flick that you'd spend hours watching the making-of featurettes...",1384905600,,954,4.633136094674557

Although, I sense a problem with Sam's parents and the sexual innuendoes and language that just wasn't necessary and was even embarrassing to watch. These are still cartoon characters after all. Sam is an American teen seeking his first car, and it turns out to be an old Camero. He discovers later that his auto, is actually an Autobot, an advanced scout seeking info on the whereabouts of a pair of old glasses that holds the clue to a relic they are desperately seeking. They aren't alone as Washington has picked up a Decepticon signal and the American base in Quatar is attacked. Sam is brought to meet the other Autobots and learns from Prime just what is going on. The major glitch is Agent Simmons from Sector Seven, a rather nasty forceful man who seeks to interfere and has knowledge of where the relic is actually hidden, along with an unpleasant surprise called Megatron who has been a longtime captive of Sector Seven at Hoover Dam. He captured Bumblebee the camero, and it is only when Sam negotiates what he knows can he free the autobot and rescue the All Spark relic from Megatron when it is taken to Mission City.

1609982,3,B00005JPNO,"How is this movie classified?  A cartoon with live action, or are the actors CGI too?  Is it a very long commercial for a toy franchise?

I watched this movie with no appreciation for the toys it was based on.  Without a sentimental attachment, it was just another heavily laden F/X flick: high on explosions low on content (forget plot or character development).  The story.........sentient robots from outer space arrive on Earth and morph into vehicles.  Why?  They make for some peculiar disguises.
Apparently, there are good bots and bad bots, it's difficult to tell the difference, they have to be constantly identified as one or the other (they could us some name tags: HI, I'm Megatron, I'm a stinker).  They interact with humans, in particular, a goofy nerd with a motor mouth (Shia LaBeouf) who says a lot without actually saying anything at all.  All the bots are after some doodad called the AllSpark.  It gets rather messy after that with the prerequisite explosions and the whirly-twirly changes of the bots; the amount of destruction is what you would expect from this type of movie.  (It's presumed that countless people must have also died during the devastation but all that's kept safely out of sight, they don't even imply it.)  This movie is played more for laughs than anything else; there is no shortage of comedy relief.  From Bernie Mac as a used cars salesman to Shia LaBeouf's witless parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), with John Turturro outdoing everyone as a power crazed officious oaf from a secret-top-secret organization called Sector 7.

There are no real surprises, nothing truly amazing happens, just a lot of metal clanging about.  I suppose this is what comes from children believing their toys are real and imbuing them with life.  They're real only as long as you believe they are.",1367971200,,1824,4.873376623376624

My ordinary sized TV screen with its lack of the impedimenta of modern technology simply did not allow me to appreciate what there was to appreciate for someone rather much beyond his teens. Certainly the technology appeared to be impressive but  not with the equipment I had (which is more than adequate for most of what I  play). So, think of how it will look without  the full impact of what is on the screen, leaving the  adventures of two teen-agers who save the world, as your main entertainment.",1365120000,,602,4.527777777777778

The one thing i don't like is that the sophistication and richness of the tranformers language does not match their history or technology.  For instance, when Megatron comes out of his 100 year coma, what's the first thing he says? ""I am Megatron"".  Pretty lame.  Overall though, keeps things moving along.

1610159,4,B00005JPNO,"Transformers(2007) is a fun piece of cheese from Michael Bay. In the 1980's, Hasbro bought up a bunch of Japanese toy robots and built a forced story line around the robots. Transformers was criticized for casual racism, sexism, and for its bombastic, loud action scenes. Using Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime was a nice touch, but the Transformers theme song is left out. Sam Witwicky(Shia LeBeouf) helps the Autobots fight back against Megatron and the Decepticons! This film should not be confused with the 1986 animated Transformers motion picture. Megan Fox played Sam's comely, sexy girlfriend. Transformers was a big part of 1980's pop culture. You could buy 20 Transformers and turn them into one big robot. The Go Bots were the poor man's Transformers. Michael Jackson turns into a Transformer in the 1988 film Moonwalker. There were two Transformers sequels that were even more vulgar and overblown than this one. Transformers is jam packed with gooey cheese.

Man, was I wrong!  I was immediately sucked in!  This is a great movie!  The autobots do actually have a story, and a good one, and their CG acting is better than real life actors nowadays (my opinion).  And the big action scenes~ they slow them down!  Instead of speeding the action to make it look more ""awesome"" to kids (and guys), they put it on slowmo~ so you actually see the transformers transform!  And you see what all their gadgetry can do.
Best part?  When it was over and I asked my son what his favorite part was, he said he loved how the Transformers always worked as a team- like a family.",1358380800,2,866,4.162650602409639

Iron-hide was a warrior.  Optimus Prime a leader and a warrior.  Megatron a tyrant.  Star-Scream an ambitious fool.
The battles were vivid and intense, emotionally and physically - for transformers and humans.

1610464,4,B00005JPNO,"I benefited from not knowing much about Transformers. Never had the toys and never watched the cartoon series (although it's likely I'd give the cartoon, and shows like Power Rangers, a negative review). It was all new to me - the aliens attacking our base in the Mideast, the cute little (evil) robot, Megatron secretly in cold storage. It was new, and watching, it all seemed well-done. This could be one reason the sequels aren't as good. The exposition and the newness of it all IS the movie. The sequels to the awesome film The Matrix weren't nearly as good either. Perhaps when it gets to the second movie film makers don't have a carefully laid out plan to depend upon or to try and bring to life. I've seen so many films since this one that seemed like a copy of this movie: 'Aliens' (who may look or behave a lot like us) from a different dimension attempt to invade earth. I enjoyed the original here better.

I enjoyed the humor, the human characters, the robot's struggle and the efforts of our leaders to keep up with it.

In a previous review I noted that an average looking guy (like the young hero in this movie Shia LaBeouf) always has to be paired up with one of the most beautiful women in the world. Every time. Movie, TV, doesn't matter. Perhaps this is even true in internet adds too. The unconscious lesson being internalized is that of having a woefully mismatched standard for a girlfriend? This is true in Transformers as well. First we see the hero, then we see a systems analyst for the government played by Rachel Taylor, a young woman who truly must be one of the most beautiful women on Earth.

1610467,5,B00005JPNO,"Transformers, directed by Bryan Singer, is a recap of the famous cartoon series that aired on TV years before. With a different plot than the cartoon series, but the same characters, brings people who loved the series back into being a part of the Transformers culture.
The movie tells of an ancient war that occurred between an advance machine-like extra-terrestrial aliens who have the ability to copy vehicles on earth and change into and out of them. The Autobots and their leader Optimus Prime return to earth hoping to defend the earth from the sinister Megatron and his followers the Decepticons as the look for the hidden allspark. The allspark was once on the former alien's planet, Cybertron, but the Autobots had successfully blasted it off the planet. Megatron was successfully able to blast off to look for it. the allspark landed on earth, as well as Megatron did, but were both frozen during the changing planets temperature. The movie reveals some of the cartoons criteria of the ancient battle of Cybertron that had occured on the series keep it orginal to its cartoon plot. Which is satisfying knowing that the movie; Transformers, decided not to change much of its original formatting.

As we continue on in the movie we learn that thousands of years later, an avergage, teenage Sam WitWicky's, grandson of Captain Arnold Witcicky, who has information that the Decepticons need in order to re-locate the allspark on earth. With this information Sam's life changes dramactically knowing that he is know part of an inter-galactic war that has been going on for ages, faces the most incredible decisions of his life.

The movie offers such insight high velocity characters that bring into I would say an action-adventure movie. With its amazing visual arts and graphics offer great detail to the Transformer character's. The movie's also special effects impact the consumer's high with incredible explosions and powerful sound effects that rattle the eardrum like an actual drum. Transformers also brings an intensifying soundtrack that plays perfectly with the storyline of the movie. The characters blend so well with each other that one can truly relate to what is going on in the movie, and can actual feel apart of the it, with suspense and overall excitement in the back of their heads.

One of the things that I find negative about this movie is the fact that one of the Transformers characters, BumbleBee, Sam Wickwicky's autobot guardian, is unable to talk, but however uses parts talk radio and certain parts of radio news or entertainment to be able to communicate with sam. It made it difficult for me to really appreciate this, knowing that Bumblee, should be able to talk compared to the cartoon series.

Overall some would argue that the movie played too much to sell and rather keep it original to the cartoon series theme, but however with the engaging of new technology Transformers truly was able to highlight the characters that brought love to so many viewers years ago, while adding brand new view of the Transformers culture. The movie brought the characters to life, rather than keep it on a sheet of paper, allowing for viewers to see their once favorite characters almost in person. the movie truly impacted the entertainment world and now is seen by millions of people all over the world.

1610525,3,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella. However, whether producing or directing, greatness has eluded him. The aversion to greatness held true under his direction of Transformers.

Transformers is a good movie. Tons of action. But Bay gets TV-acting performances (at best) out of the cast.

The movie makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on campy...corny even. Kids will find some of the humor amusing, but serious action fans will tire quickly of the overpopulated campyness.

The Transformers special effects are spectacular. And ya gotta hand it to the producers for heavying up on the FX in the trailers to lure the audience in. But ultimately Transformers is less than meets the eye.

The story is a good one. A robotic civilization brings their civil war to Earth. The Autobots defend mankind from the Decepticons that want to locate and revive their leader who crashed to Earth 100 years ago, then use a talisman of sorts to turn all manmade machinery into robots. Sounds cool and looked cool in the trailers, but I was rooting for the end of the movie as much as I was for the heroes after 90 minutes...and you get 144 minutes of Transformers. A lot of the camp and filler could have been eliminated to make a more seemingly action packed film.

Some of the action was a bit over the top where the stars (human I mean) seemed to be able to defy death. And our main human heroes were a couple of kids from The OC instead of The Military. But, I was entertained. At least you'll now be able to see this cool FX movie on Blu Ray.",1343088000,3,1594,4.54006968641115

1610586,5,B00005JPNO,Like any blueblooded child of the 80's I was elbow deep into Transformers from day one. When in kindergarten I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up and I always responded with a transformer. I can remember playing for hours endlessly with my transformers. While watching this movie in theaters that all came rushing back; so much so that I watched it at the pre-release and 3 times on release date. The day it came out on HDDVD I bought a HD DVD player for my 360 just to watch it. When it came out on bluray I watched it then. I also bought it on DVD at one point as well.

1610589,5,B00005JPNO,"This movie is a love letter to transformers fans, with a great story and fighting robot action through a lot of the movie. The humor is well done I thought as well. You have the story of the Autobots vs. the Decepticons, and builds up a story that revolves around Sam and what his destiny is.

The graphics are amazing; this has to be the definite look for the transformers with a ton of moving parts. You see so much detail on the robots that they look like they fit in perfectly, and don't look like they are CG at all. The special effects are great, and like any Michael Bay film you have a ton of explosions. This mixed with fighting robots fits so perfectly. You also have great military operations, and you feel like Michael did his research into this.

The sound track is phenomenal. Wither it being the main theme for this movie, or the theme you hear during bring the rain I absolutely loved it. I mean this sound track is Emmy award winning. With the sound effects, bullets sound really good and explosions are great. The cars sound really good in this movie, and its cool hearing them rev up and racing down the street getting shot at.

The setting takes place in multiple locations and they do a real good job in making them look professionally done, and really cool looking. You have a desert location, military bases, washing DC, and so many others that show up in the course of this movie.

This Edition of the Transformers movie you only have the movie disk, and not the second disk which has the special features so I won't be talking about those since I don't have that version.

Overall I say for everyone to buy this movie, It's an amazing movie, with great action sequences that bring back memories of watching transformers when I was younger.

1610591,5,B00005JPNO,"since I was a child, I wish live to someday see a transformers movie. I mean a non animated one because I saw the 1986 movie and was like a 2 hour chapter. was fun  and all but was still a cartoonish one. I just couldn't imagine to see Optimus Prime riding in a real filmed road, or see Starcscream flying in a real sky, you got my point.

when I find that some guy will make the movie, and see that guy will be Michael Bay, I couldn't get more excited, I would see my beloved ""friends"" of my childhood with lots of huge explosions and nasty destruction and devastation that obviously can't be allowed in the cartoon. and of course, the day has come and I was not disappointed, at least not much. :P

the movie has few flaws for long time fans like me. for amazon's rules I must warn about spoilers but come on, who will not see this movie yet? (if you don't, what the hell are you waiting for? =D ). anyway, SPOILER ALERT:

- I was a little bit disappointed to see that Bumblebee was not a VW bug but a Camaro. I must assume that a cute bug (the one or old edition) will not fit in the line of destruction and pseudo violence (still robots, oil not blood) that Bay wants for the film so I could forgive that. and Jazz too.

- Another real bad part in the same way was Megatron, in fact, I think he is the most disappointing transformation, in all the 3 movies (Walther P-38 FTW!), the original Megatron was the beginning of my handguns fever. =DDD

- Maybe one of the worst part as an old fashion fan, was the forced introduction of Megan Fox character. of course, I'm a man and I love hot chicks but, I just feel a little uncomfortable mixing something that brings me so many great memories from my childhood with, well, Megan Fox. again, I assume that like any Hollywood movie there's some stuffs that must be check marked, and just right behind ""lots of explosions and destroyed things"" must be ""hot decorative bimbo"", with the plus ""hotter is better"", so I'm cool with that.

- Another thing that I don't like was the comet-like travelling and arrival of the transformers. and that come worst when talk about the Ark in the third movie. so this leave a lots of questions like exactly and geographically talking, where they came out or ""fired"" to the earth?, and those questions rise on number in the third movie.

- And the last and the worst of all, the cube issue. all the plot around the cube looks like was wrote in the last minute, like the answer to ""what Decepticons want in the Earth that must be protected by the Autobots?"" and again messed in the coming movies like the Ark, when they talk about the real thing: Energon.

but those are minor flaws that are forgiven in exchange of one of the greatest action movie that I saw ever and the huge amount of nostalgic memories that brings with it.

I read few reviews, specially the negative ones and I just laugh. come on guys, some people just must stay with ""sense and sensitive"", ""the bridges of Madison county"", ""green fried tomatoes and all that kind of movies if you want some ""serious plot and acting"". WTF are you doing seeing this movie if you are a Broadway critic?. you are a little stupid if you go to a Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris movie looking for for some ""deep acting"" or ""feelings movers lines"", so much as you go to see ""the english patient"" looking for badass sci fi action and destruction, and then out of the theaters disappointed, so why rate 1 star?. right kind of movie for right kind of people. must be some way (an effective one actually) of rate the reviews here Amazon, come on.",1325808000,2,3569,4.321375186846039
1610657,5,B00005JPNO,I purchased this movie for my grandson's for Christmas.  It arrived so fast that I was surprised. The boys loved it.  I love Amazon.,1325548800,,132,4.458333333333333
1610658,5,B00005JPNO,"I love ""Transformers"" for all the many layers that it brings together.

There's the US Army over in Qatar, fighting a desert war. That's one layer.

Another layer is the hero of the movie, Sam (played by Shia LaBeouf), the loud-mouth smart-aleck high schooler trying to get the girl and protect his turf against the school jocks. His main weapon in the survival game is his wits and that yellow user muscle car. Varoom Varoom!

Let's not forget Bernie Mac (RIP) either, in a lovely character role as Bobby Bolivia the User Car Guy. (SIDEBAR: Life is so unfair! How did a guy that sweet and warm die that young? Where's the justice and logic in that? He is in Ocean 13 too and it is hard to watch such a wonderful human being only as a fond memory.)

The thickest layer of the story is of course these vicious aliens that transform themselves into any kind of mechanical contraption they want. And boy, what fascinating wonders of imagination they contort their levers, shafts, and wheels into! Totally a boy's dream, multiplied by a thousand.

Sam gets the girl (Megan Fox the gorgeous), well almost, at least gets her to ride in his yellow (and very used) muscle car. And then we are cut to the other serious plot - US national security is threatened by the frontal attack on national leadership by machine-beings that disguise themselves as cassette players and change shapes and infiltrate even Air Force One. Scary but a cool sub-plot right there.

There is a whole lot of ""listening stations"" picking up ""weird chirps, sounds, and transmissions"" from space, or is it Qatar? The mischievous transformer on Air Force One plants a virus to bring down the whole US defense network. VIRUS ALARMS go off and things start to escalate. Guns are fired and the War of The Worlds unfold as Jon Voight playing the US President tries to keep a lid on things... to no avail.

The scene in which the STEEL SCORPION chews up an army unit in the desert takes the cake for visual artistry and imagination!

A great fantasy for teenagers of all ages.",1325116800,2,2036,4.604972375690608

I just loved it!  Action, teen angst, transforming cars, humor, tremendous special effects and even a cameo by Bernie Mac!

We meet Sam Witwicky giving a presentation to his classmates about his ancestor, a famous explorer, Archibald Witwicky, and brings some of the old tools of the trade that this explorer had used to make his way to the great white snows where he just happened to make a discovery that eventually drove him looney.

And in the audience is classmate and his heart's desire, Mykaela, who has a California stud football player nestled against her while listening to Sam talk about old time seamen and trying to sell his great grandfather's tools so that he can get enough for his first car.

His father takes him to get that new car, which in actuality is an Autobot, a Transformer, the very adorable and very protective Bumblebee.

It turns out that among those old things his great grandfather left behind is the key to saving humanity from the Decepticons, the evil transformers who intend to morph human technology into a new army to wipe humans out and take over our planet since they cannot get home to Cybertron, destroyed by the battle between the two Transformer factions.

What ensues is a race against time and the Decepticons to find their leader, the uber evil Megatron, and in the doing of it, Optimus Prime, the leader of the small contingent of Autobots who have come to earth looking for Megatron, discover that he came here because he was hunting the Allspark, the energy source that gave life to the Transformers as a race of beings.

The special effects are dazzling, the relationships between the humans and the Autobots is wonderful as a lesson in life because no matter how differently we may look on the outside, it's what's inside that truly counts.

I love this movie and while I have all three in the series thus far, this is by far the best of the three.

The plot is clear and focused, the humor and action are well blended and the special effects don't dominate and overwhelm the story.

It's a fantastic movie and one that we've watched more than a dozen times, most recently in a Transformer movie marathon, which allowed me to see very clearly that this is the most satisfying and enjoyable of the three movies.

Why were the Transformers guest stars in their own movie?

Optimus Prime says ""My Bad""?!?
The token black Autobot is torn in half by megatron?
Bumblebee is a CAMARO?!?

I wasn't asking for much - just a big summer blockbuster with some one-liners and action and maybe a little nostalgia (in my defense, I grew up in the eighties; the allure of Saturday-morning cartoons was strong).

But dang - this movie is bad. When buying the ticket, I'd failed to recall the possibility that if you make a 150-minute movie that is largely dedicated to computer generated machines, you might wind up with a story that lacks any feeling. The characters here are paper thin, even for a summer action movie (for perspective, the guys in this movie make Arnold Schwarzenegger's roles look profound). In fact, I feel bad even using the word 'characters' in connection with this flick - for that term implies that the script has bothered to endow its people with even the vaguest hint of a significant character or emotional arc. This script hasn't; its characters are the merest figments of stick people.

Worse news: the dialogue here is almost mono-syllabic, and the split-second, choppy editing is migraine inducing. As for the acting... Well, the less said about that, the better. Now excuse me; I need to go watch something real.",1310169600,2,1277,4.696428571428571

Also good actors played in it like megan fox ans shia labeouf. My favorite autobot of the whole movie is ironhide and my favorite decepticon is brawl.

Cue in the good robots, who have the delightful capability to turn into cool sports cars (or anything else), a nerdy kid and his sexy crush, and earth might have a chance after all.

The script was mediocre, the story average, and the acting ok. There were a few good jokes, and the good robots...err, autobots, were more or less cool. Megan Fox's character was...well, beautiful. I'm pretty sure there wasn't any other point to her being there. Megatron was pretty lame. His best taunt after being frozen for years and years and emerging to wreak havoc was ""I am Megatron!"" Really? That sounds about as scary as a pinball game.

The movie ends after what seems like an eternity of explosions, robot  martial arts, and metal-crunching-and-bone-breaking fights.

Second off, I think that they should have used a different actress for the role of Mikela. Meghan Fox looks like the only reason why she did this film was for the money. The action sequences were very well done. Michael Bay know how to do his action sequences very well(He probably spends more money on explosion than third world countries do on food). But he also puts in so much unnessary stuff in his movies(Like Pearl Harbor, the romance ruined the movie). In the case of this movie it was 50 profanties and lack of modesty. Seriously this is based off a bunch of toys intended for children!

The performances are solid if unremarkable with the exception of Jon Tuturro, who stands out in his role as a self-important man in black.

The starting blackout screen will always run in my head as one of the greatest starting sequences of all time. I can't believe how amazingly brilliant it is to see that helicopter transform right in front of your eyes.

1611007,1,B00005JPNO,"Having grown up in the 80s, and being a big fan of the TV Series/Half Hour Toy Line Infomercial that inspired this movie I approached it both with eager excitement and lots of caution, since I consider Michael Bay one of the worst filmmakers in history. I wasn't disappointed: this is the worst film I have ever seen in a film theater during my entire 37 years on this earthly realm. To say that I hated every single frame of this 149 minute debacle with all my heart, soul and body is an enormous understatement: this is the film that killed a Sci-Fi loving metalhead's faith on Hollywood blockbusters forever.
Now, I could write pages upon pages about why I hate this movie so much, but for brevity's sake I'll just settle on my Top Ten Reasons:
1)For a movie that's supposedly about giant transforming robots fighting each other there's a real shortage of moments in which said giant transforming robots fight each other.
2)On the rare moments in which said giant transforming robots do fight each other, it looks like giant piles of scrap metal crashing into each other and it's almost impossible to tell what's happening thanks to the jump editing, shoddy camera work and CGI overload.
3)The giant transforming robots in their robot form look really ugly, soulless and unsympathetic. The design of the original robots from the TV Series/Half Hour Toy Line Infomercial might have been simplified and blocky, but it surely got the job done and didn't manage to make them look like a garish Rube Goldberg nightmare.
4)The Autobot's vehicle forms are all GMC models. Look, I work in Advertising and don't mind product placement in fiction when it's tastefully done, but this is just going too far.
5)This film is obscenely loud. Having listened to heavy metal for more than 25 years now I'm not a slouch when it comes to loudness, but the levels of this movie made me feel physically uncomfortable on the theater.
6)The script is crap. Instead of focusing on the Autobots versus Decepticons struggle, the script has a nerdy boy meets beautiful yet tough girl main plot and a bunch of stupid subplots that go nowhere.
7)Said script features the biggest holes and internal inconsistencies I can remember on any major blockbuster.
8)The comic relief is groan inducing at best and utterly retarded at worst. Seriously, peeing robots?
9)The sexy cryptography expert character is even stupider than the physics student/fashion model character in Spiderman III. No wonder they were played by the same actress.
10)I have no problem with the fact that Megan Fox can't act and her role in this movie is just being a piece of eye candy. What I really can't stand are all those endless cleavage and fully clothed ass shots. If you're going to treat a girl like a piece of sexy meat, at least have the decency to show her naked once in a while and stop teasing so much. The last time a cleavage shot interested me was when I was a teenager, and even back then, films managed to sneak some decent nudity in blockbusters, all this PG-13 naughtiness is not even remotely sexy, just childish and annoying.
So, in closing, if you enjoy this movie, I pity you since this means you're hopelessly stupid, have neither taste nor capacity to enjoy movies or any artistic experience whatsoever and it's possible you were born without a soul, just like Michael Bay.",1282089600,3,3341,4.752151462994837
1611008,1,B00005JPNO,"This movie should have been about giant robots. If you want an emotional film then go ahead and explore the emotional lives of the robots, but no, we end up exploring the boring banal lives of some teenage twits.

Total disappointment. There are action films where the plot gets out of the way so we can have fun. There are action films where the plot and the action work together to make a great movie. Then there are movies like this were the plot gets in the way and totally ruins the fun of the action.",1279065600,4,506,4.270833333333333

LOL.....",1277683200,,279,4.090909090909091
1611010,5,B00005JPNO,"Wow! They pulled it off. When I heard that Transformers was being made into a live action feature, I was suspect. Even with today's CGI, I couldn't help but wonder. Kudos to Michael Bay, because not only did he pull it off, it was fantastic. The story centers around Sam (Labeouf), whose great grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries of all time: NBE1. Sam soon finds himself in the middle of a war between Autobots and Decepticons for the All Spark. A cube that can give life and save Cybertron. Protected by Bumblebee and led by Optimus Prime, Sam goes on a wild ride to help the Autobots keep the All Spark from the Decepticons and NBE1 aka: Megatron!

The story is actually well done and not rushed. It takes awhile before you really see a Transformer. The acting is strong as well. LaBeouf is a great fit as Sam and Megan Fox (will not win any oscars) makes for great eye candy. Voight and Turturro are excellent in supporting roles. The real stars are the Transformers and they don't disappoint. Peter Cullen returns from the cartoon to voice Optimus and thank God. He was tremendous! Hugo Weaving plays Megatron and his presence is felt. I was never a big fan of the cartoons growing up, but there is more to this film than meets the eye! (Couldn't help myself!)

NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Super sharp and gorgeous! Colors are vibrant and Blu Ray brings these robots to life so much better than DVD! Audio is extremely strong as well.

This movie has a great story line, does a good job of keeping in line with the origial cartoon, while taking on a personality of it's own.  Lot's of action, comedy and adventure!  I LOVE when they use well known American icon's, such as the Hoover Dam, and explain it was always a cover-up for something we American's couldn't possibly fathom!

We enjoyed the movie extra's about the cast and seeing the level of detail that they put into the special effects in the movie.  No surprise to anyone who has actaully watched the movie!

It's quite a feast for the eyes too, with different locales like Egypt, the Smithsonian museum, and all of the expensive military play toys (battleships, tanks, aircraft carriers, flying predator drones and so on).

As for the movie itself, it's watchable at best and I'm a fan of Transformers. Basically this movie is one awkward moment after another. Like someone does something strange in public, but I guess that makes it seem charming (robot leg humping, dogs humping, the lead character getting caught in a compromising position). The awkwardness made it like a PG-13 American Pie only with robots.

Speaking of the robots, they really felt tacked on. Like the movie could have replaced them with terrorists and fast cars. At some point I forgot there were Transformers in it! I felt the same way with the lead heroine Megan Fox. It was pointless to have her in the movie after the first 30 minutes and she probably should have been killed off earlier on. The movie made good use of her running in slow motion. The action is big budget with Transformers tangling with Decepticons, but really, the action wasn't all that good. It was different to watch giant robots fighting with humans in the way, but was it good, nope. Also it was difficult to tell one Decepticon from another and I know all the characters. Maybe if they were painted bright and flashy colors to differentiate them like the Transformers it would have been easier.",1268179200,,1546,4.764925373134329

This movie was probably one of the most well thought out and most well made films I have seen in a long time (even the sequel was good which is such a shocker.)  It made me want to see more ideas from the producer and writers, and it also made me change my ways of thinking that not all sequels are terrible.

1611115,4,B00005JPNO,"Director Michael Bay's movies have either been hit or miss. Armageddon and Pearl Harbor were basically powerhouses with uninspired plots. There are a few good films that he directed as well, such as The Rock and Bad Boys, for example. This is one of them, based on the popular long-running action figure line of the same name, Transformers. It has been around since the 1980's and spun off many anime series, and I saw some episodes of Armada as a pre-teen. I then heard about this live-action film adaptation to the series in 2007 and, believe it or not, I thought it was pretty good. It is nothing epic like Terminator 1 & 2, but still good cheesy fun. Acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg also joined in as an executive producer as well. It involves the Autobots, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz, and Ratchet teaming up with a teenage boy Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), and Commander Robert Epps (Jon Voight), to stop the Decepticons, Megatron, Starscream, Frenzy, Barricade, Bonecrusher, and Blackout from claiming the Cube of the All Spark when Sam unknowingly buys Bumblebee as his first car. Simple, but enjoyable. They intend to use the All Spark Cube to restore their home planet Cybertron. When the Decepticons launch an attack at the Hoover Dam and the Autobots lure them into the city where many of the Decepticons were destroyed, especially Megatron when Sam shoves the Cube into his chest. They dump their corpses into the Laurentian Abyss, Sam and Mikaela form a relationship, and the Autobots spread a message to the rest of their kind in space that they made a new home on Earth. The only surviving Decepticon was Starscream leaving to inform The Fallen, setting the stage for the overtly stupid sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, that I will review later on. However, the original is a great movie. The visual effects and action are top notch. The acting is good as well, with a few corny lines every now and then. Peter Weller reprises the role of Optimus Prime, and even though he also voiced Ironhide in the original cartoons, Jess Harnell fills in and replicates it just fine. The sets also looked real. There are a couple minor issues however. The focus on the humans was a little overplayed in expense to the Autobots, but that would just be nit-picking. This is another movie worth picking up. I would recommend it to anyone, even die-hard Transformers fans.",1267228800,,2428,4.824940047961631
1611116,1,B00005JPNO,"I wish I saw in this the same movie that a lot of other people are giving four- and five-star ratings to. By way of full disclosure, I was a huge Transformers geek as a kid--had all the toys, was wrecked when they killed Optimus Prime and a host of other characters in order to introduce an updated toy line in the big-screen animated movie--you get the picture. That said, I don't understand why anyone would think this movie to be anything other than a rough draft that got filmed before they finished writing it.

Bay's film tries to do humor, tries to do intrigue, tries to do action, and tries to do sci-fi, but it so fails to integrate those aspects together into a cohesive film that the final product feels like a John Hughes teen comedy duct-taped to a Tom Clancy spy thriller and a copy of Black Hawk Down. The humor in particular just rubs wrong against what could have been another two-dimensional franchise updated to take place in the same world we occupy, in the vein of the first two X-Men movies, or the relaunched Batman franchise.

Even as far as visuals are concerned I was pretty let down: the robots' designs were massively overcomplicated relative to their cartoon counterparts in order to produce a more real-world look, but a side-effect is that fight scenes blur into sequences of giant robotic tumbleweeds swirling around each other.

The only bright spots I took away from this movie were the return of Peter Cullen as the iconic voice of Optimus Prime, and the use of a few choice pieces of dialogue picked from twenty years of Transformers history. Watch it once if you're curious, but in this reviewer's opinion you're better off watching the 1986 animated film.",1266624000,3,1693,4.655518394648829

We got this for a Friday night mind-numbathon, expecting nothing. I saw part of its sequel in a multiplex last year before walking out, and was hoping this was better. It was.

Certainly no masterpiece, it does however have a ton of action, some good humor, and maybe the best CGI I've ever seen. The Transformers work perfectly and never seem fake; they are in fact amazingly realistic. LaBeefcake is good in his part, Fox lives up to her name, and Turturro is quite funny. Voight hams it up a bit too much, but this movie never takes itself too seriously, its saving grace.

I've watched few of Bay's movies; haven't even seen Armageddon, The Rock, or most of the others. This may be just like them, in which case I'll give them a shot next time I want to stop thinking and just see some flashy eye candy. The blu-ray did look very sharp, with good depth and colors, certainly one of the better transfers I've seen. Lots of extras too, for the true Trans fans. I never even saw the original cartoon, so have no idea how faithful this is, but coming in cold I did enjoy this movie, cheese and all.

The funniest parts are the pathetically obvious GM product placements. The bad guys show up as planes, etc, but the good guys always arrive in a convoy of GMC vehicles (no doubt getting 10 mpg) to save the day. Of course, in reality their cars would have broken down halfway there and the company would have gone bankrupt, but oh well, take that product placement money while you can!

Hardly any work of genius, except for the guys who CGI'ed the Transformers themselves, this flick nonetheless overcomes its occasionally daft script and is a fine choice for a colorful, action-filled couple hours of suspending disbelief and being amazed at how far CGI has come in the last decade.",1264204800,,1794,4.5246913580246915
1611185,4,B00005JPNO,"If you're reading this review, chances are you are not a huge Transformers fan.  This being a week after the movie was released and you're waiting for my golden words to tell you if you should see it or not.  That's fine with me, you are my target audience, non-fan, because I am one as well.  I never had anything against the cartoon, it just missed me somehow when it was taking over America.  Luckily I don't think a Rainbow Brite movie is on the horizon for me to pretend not to be excited about.

  So this week's Movie Of The Summer is here.  And to just lay it out there for you, dear reader, it's not a bad way to spend a summer afternoon.  The movie is fun, well shot, has good music, and it has a really good sense of humor about itself.  This is good because had it taken itself seriously at all I think I would have hated it, given its origins.

  In addition to being an adaptation from an 80's pop culture icon, the script reeks of stolen property from attempted franchise films past, most notably Independence Day, and Small Soldiers. On the Independence Day front, the alien menace attacks a military base, destroying it and leaving the majority of the personnel dead.  The pentagon studies the signal from the threat but it takes a civilian computer hacker to crack the code, though in this one our hackers are hired by the government as opposed to a guy who works for the cable company.  And oddly enough there's a secret branch of the government that has known about the presence of the aliens and has been keeping a crash-landed specimen in a hidden bunker since the 40's, a bunker so hidden even top levels of the administration don't know about it.

  Then we have Shia LeBeouf, as an awkward teenager who discovers his new toy, in this case a Camarro instead of an action figure, is alive, and is in a state of war against another group of toys.  He also enlists the aid of a girl from school he has a crush on in his attempt to help his friends the Gorgonittes... I'm sorry, the Autobots, in their efforts to defeat their enemy.  The movie even went so far as to cast Kevin Dunn in the role of the boys father.

  LeBeouf however more than holds his own as the closest thing the movie has to a protagonist.  I have a feeling this kid is becoming a punchline simply because of the amount of movies he has been in recently, but he's got some chops.  More props however go to John Turturro who is just awesome as a takes-him-self-too-seriously government agent.

  The only thing I didn't like about it speaks less about this movie and more towards a general resentment I'm starting to feel towards Hollywood blockbusters, which is that I find CGI-on-CGI fights to be boring.  It's why I didn't like the fight sequences that much in King Kong, but why I loved the ones in Lord of the Rings, which also used miniatures and loads of extras.  The big pitch of this movie was ""let's take that cartoon and make it live action,"" but at the end of the day, when all the impossible stuff is being made on a computer, isn't it just a cartoon with a real-world background?",1263427200,,3083,4.376760563380282

1611191,4,B00005JPNO,"It is called the All Spark. Powerful. Incredible. Able to create robotic life and destroy it just as quickly.

On Cybertron, a planet far, far away, a war arose when a robot named Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, wanted the power of the All Spark for himself. Optimus Prime and his band of Autobots rose up against him and their battle destroyed their homeworld, sending the cube-shaped All Spark into space.

Lost.

The Autobots and Decepticons scoured the galaxy looking for it, knowing that whoever found it first would be the victor and would decide the fate of not just one world, but the universe.

The All Spark found its way to Earth, but not before Megatron tracked it there. It landed in the Arctic, and Megatron was frozen there until found later on by Captain Witwicky, explorer.

Decades later, his grandson, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), needs a car and after visiting a used-car dealer ends up coming home with an old Chevy Camaro. Little does he know the car is more than meets the eye and lurking beneath its yellow shell is an Autobot named Bumblebee. It's not long till Sam finds out and is thrust into a robotic world where two teams of giant robots compete to find the All Spark.

Joining Sam is his high school crush, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), whom reluctantly is dragged on this journey with him but soon finds herself getting interested in this guy who she barely knew existed.

It's robot vs robot in this giant epic of good vs evil, fireballs, bullets and vehicles that are more than meets the eye.

What can I say? When I heard they were taking the Transformers from my childhood and lifting them from the cartoon to ""real life,"" I was ecstatic. I was also concerned because I knew it'd take a crazy amount of CGI to make it happen, and not just any CGI either--good CGI. The last thing I wanted was for a bunch of cartoony robots with rubbery parts dominating the screen.

Boy, was I shocked when I saw Bumblebee transform and tower over all, shining his spotlight into the sky, or when Optimus Prime showed up and that glorious digital transformation sound roared and he stood proud, huge and detailed.

This stuff was real, and it looked like the makers of this movie actually made real Autobots and Decepticons to make it happen.

Good times.

Storywise, yeah, I liked it. The alien invasion thing worked. Very well done. Same with the notion that, unlike the cartoons (from what I recall), the Autobots had a vow of secrecy to keep themselves hidden from the humans while they searched for the All Spark.

Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky was funny, same with Kevin Dunn as his father.

The story also bodes well for a sequel, which has now come and gone, with more stories in the works. If you're going to go epic, like Transformers did, you're going to need more than one. Last I heard, they're doing 5 or 6 of these things. Me? I'm all for it. I go into these things expecting a good time and not some life-altering film where, years later, I look back and see it as a turning point for me. Transformers is just that: a good time, and one that tickled my inner fanboy.

More than meets the eye? You betchya!

1611299,1,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" is arguably the worst movie ever made, with the possible exception of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Why do so many people take it so seriously? Do they have a crush on Sam's criminal girlfriend? Or on that blond woman with the funny accent? She sounds like Kylie Minogue! The fat Black guys were funny when dancing, but only for so long. Oh yes, there were some robots involved, as well. Did anyone notice?

The concept isn't bad (if you are 12 years old). Evil robot, good robot, the All Spark, hot teenage girl, secret government operations, hackers...

The execution, however, is lousy. Frankly, this must be the ultimate turkey movie. And who on earth is that chicken-eating cowboy who shows up all the time? The guy the Indians shoot at?

Oh, sorry, that was a Swedish TV commercial... My mistake.

The only redeeming feature of ""Transformers"" is the music. Could have worked in a real epic, about Ulysses or something. But otherwise, you need to be pretty low brow to find this even involuntarily funny.

On those three counts, this film was a rousing success.  I, on the other-hand, enjoy outdated concepts like writing, dialogue, acting and a funny thing called ""plot"".

The movie is just so badly put together from a thinking mans point of view.  Don't get me wrong, the film is a beautiful spectacle.  The effects used to create the robots are astonishing.  The way Bay refused to hide the effects in darkness was a bold move, and it worked.  However, The Dark Knight proved that you can make a smart, thinking mans film, based on a concept generally aimed at children. And on top of all that plot, acting and dialogue, there were also massive special effects.  Outside of the visuals, Transformers failed to be even an adequate film on nearly every level.

Here is the most maddening part of the film:

*  The military has a cube that the decepticons want.  The cube is in a heavily guarded military installation.  What is the most logical thing to do with it?  Why drive it into the middle of a populated city of course!

If you choose to watch this film, please do yourself a favor and watch it in BluRay with full digital surround sound, and shut off your brain.  Just eat popcorn drink soda and ""feel"" the film for what it is.  A vehicle for Michael Bay to show you all his neat toys.

Funny, fun, and the best action in any film I've ever seen. Fabulous to look at...details that knock you out. The only thing people complain about in the first film is that during the serious action in the city in the last part of the film, that it's difficult to follow. It's really in one sequence, where giant robots are falling into the sides of buildings to slow their fall from above, but what happens after you watch the film a couple of times, is that you begin to see exactly what is going on...and then it actually becomes even more impressive. Michael Bay challenges the viewer with his visuals...it's not jump cuts, etc. being overdone...what Bay creates is real density and power, which works to overwhelm us, which is what should happen to anyone who is anyway near these giant robots duking it out. The slo-mo moves are so hip...bots spinning laterally and then firing into the ground to boost their spin, etc...are probably the coolest action moves I've ever seen, or will ever see. Kudos to the wild guys at ILM...they are on a serious roll. The second film is all over the place...and has it's gifts, but this first film is excellent on all levels.  Megan Fox plays the dingy babe just right. And watch out when she gives the big smile...cause it will knock you over. She not as well used in the second film...not her fault.

1611352,1,B00005JPNO,"This is a monumentally bad film on all levels.

How bad?

Well, I recently caught it on free-to-air and still felt ripped off.

It runs for about for nine thousand years (or felt like it did), exemplifies everything that is bad about modern American cinema, and manages to make a pitched battle between giant robots in the middle of Los Angeles as interesting as queuing in a chemist to buy suppositories.

Its loud, its stupid, its obnoxious and I suspect the script may have been written by a group of Macaques encouraged to draw on the walls using their own faeces.

Also, whilst the robots may have been voiced by the guys who played them in the original cartoon series (in a nod to the fanboys), they still sounded like they were voicing bad action movie trailers with. Every. Single. Line.

Acting?

There is none.

Shia Labeouf portrays an alarmed, sweaty vole and Megan Fox makes a very convincing showroom dummy - though it must be said, neither of them were acting at any point.

Avoid this film like the plague. Its an insult to art, intelligence and human dignity.

As a friend of mine rather flippantly observed after having seen it, ""It runs for 144 minutes, the seizures last for about half an hour after that, and the shame of having sat through it will stay with you for a lifetime.""

I did like the action sequences and the appearances of the Autobots and Decepticons. I also liked John Turturro as Agent Simmons and Jon Voight as John Keller. But that's pretty much it. LaBeouf and Fox were so f***ing annoying in this film (but Fox is hot, so that keeps her from being a big downside). I was especially annoyed at LaBeouf's hyperactive personality and overly excessive dialogue. Couldn't they have created a more likable teenager as the main character? Plus, the Autobot and Decepticons were more like supporting characters. Isn't this film called ""Transformers?"" Aren't these robots supposed to be the ones we should be focusing on?

kids cartoon. It's for a younger audience, not elderly people and middle aged adults. Kids don't care about plot, character development, acting, etc. It's all about the action and special effects and nolstalgia for fans of the original cartoon! Most of these negative comments are coming from elderly people who don't like action movies, and therefore don't like Michael Bay films. IF YOU HATE ACTION MOVIES, DON'T WATCH MICHAEL BAY FILMS!! IF YOU HATE ROBOTS AND SCI FI IN GENERAL, DON'T WATCH TRANSFORMERS!! It's that simple! If you hate kids movies, don't watch this movie! Stop complaining! Don't watch the sequel either!

1611412,4,B00005JPNO,"Transformers follows suit along with several other classic cartoon series making the move to the live action big screen. Unlike Scooby Doo (Scooby snacks couldn't even make that trite not suck) and many of the rest Transformers was actually good. Transformers was a fantastically popular cartoon series from the 1980's. The shoes this movie had to fill were Megatron huge but Michael Bay surprisingly pulled it off. Bay pulls out all the stops in this leviathan of a film guaranteeing it to be a summer blockbuster smash.

Story/Script (Classic & Coming of Age): Classic story of Good vs. Evil. Alien robots called Decepticons (Evil) will basically stop at nothing for power. Their leader is Megatron whom is especially sinister. The heroic Autobots (Good) also alien robots lead by Optimus Prime are all that stands in the Decepticons way and Earths destruction. Aside from all this there is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) average American high schooler. He is just trying to get his first car (Which turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee) and go out on a date with the hottest girl in the country Samantha (Megan Fox). Sam bridges the Autobots to the story by befriending them. He also helps them seek the Allspark an all powerfull cube that the Decepticons would use to conquer the universe. Complaints about the dialogue can be made but I love all the Transformers rhetoric.
-Optimus Prime to Megatron
""One shall stand and one shall fall""
--Megatron and Optimus Prime have some mid-battle banter, Transformers style
""Humans don't deserve to live.""
""They deserve to choose for themselves!""
""Then you will die with them! Join them in extinction!""

--Megatron and Sam Witwicky have a tense moment on a Mission City rooftop.
""Give me the All Spark, and you may live to be my pet.""
""I'm never giving you this All Spark!""
""Oh, so unwise...""

Acting (Not Shakespeare but spirited): The cast all gave a lively performance. LaBeouf really keeps this movie moving with his spirited performance. The Transformers have a lot of the best dialogue and some of the best delivery. No Oscars for acting but several entertaining performances. Megan Fox is the token hot girl Samantha but her performance was more than adequate. Several decent actors played significant roles such as Jon Voight, John Turturro along with the voices of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and Hugo Weaving as Megatron.

Special Effects (Tip of the spear): This is a Michael Bay film and one thing he does well is making sure the effects are on point. Expect huge explosions, beautifully inserted digital Transformers doing what they do best transform back in forth between robots and cars, several well crafted scenes of robots going fist to cuffs, and a lot more explosions. Really this is only part of the film that deserves an ""A"".

Music (Patriotic): The music is great. Not a John William's classic great but it provides a feeling of momentum for the film. Several classic songs also inserted in the film were well placed. Plus cool Linkin Park song during credits.

Last take: Greatest Sci-fi flicks of the summer 2007 hands down. Five stars for all lovers of the classic cartoon but only three stars for nonsci-fi lovers.",1249948800,,3186,4.92364990689013
1611413,4,B00005JPNO,"Oh, Transformers, you guilty pleasure, you. I still remember when Transformers came out in theater, and my girlfriend and I bought tickets to the midnight showing a week before it played, then downed a couple bottles of soda in order to stay awake through the lengthy film. The way the seats shook, the screen lit up, the crowd cheered...it was definitely a great experience in the theaters.

Unfortunately, the DVD release didn't capture the same spirit as the original theatrical one, and Transformers became just another okay-but-not-great flick to watch with friends when nothing better was going on. How could a DVD hope to live up to the big-screen projection and booming speakers of a movie theater? It couldn't. Thankfully, with this new release of Transformers on Blu-Ray, there's now a home version of Michael Bay's robo blockbuster which can.

The Blu-Ray release of Transformers is a godsend for the movie, because the emphasis of it is certainly on the visual and audio aspects-not so much the story. The story revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeoulf), a young confused-but-spunky teen trying to get the hot girl to like him. His plot to popularity begins when he makes a deal with his dad to purchase a car, which he gets from a shady used dealer (played by the late Bernie Mac). The car is seemingly absolute trash, but after a few crazy nights it becomes apparent that there's more to it than meets the eye. (I know, I'm sorry.)

It turns out Sam's car is actually an organic robot named Bumblebee, which is part of a group known as the Autobots which came to earth to prevent the Decepticons from finding the Energon Cube which will allow them to animate earth's machinery and take over the planet. Multiple other robots make appearances in a virtual who's-who of auto product placement, and the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons (with Sam and the rest of humanity in the middle) grows and grows like a snowball of clich until the final, climatic battle.

In other words, it's the perfect Michael Bay vehicle: action, hot girls, CGI, explosions, and giant clich robots.

Obviously, Transformers didn't (and never will) win any awards for writing. The dialog is cheesy, the plot resembles Swiss cheese, and pretty much every character fills some sort of clich requirement for a blockbuster action hit. But that doesn't really matter, because the movie is a non-stop adrenaline ride (if you can weather the first half hour) and will keep you on the edge of your seat, no matter how many times you see it.

Coming to Blu-Ray, the two-disc special edition doesn't feature anything new from the previous HD-DVD release. So for those with both capabilities, there's no reason to re-purchase Transformers in high-def. For those of us who only got the movie in DVD form, however, this Blu-Ray release is a must-buy for action, video, or audio junkies.

VIDEO AND AUDIO

Now, saying Transformers is a fast-paced film would be akin to saying Pauly Shore's career is a complete mystery-everyone knows that. The DVD release struggled at times depicting all of the detail Bay wanted seen, and handling his twitchy jump cuts resulting in a lot of blur, grain, and color distortion. With this HD release, Paramount eliminates any and all possible video issues. Presented in a 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 (2.40:1) encode, no matter which scene of the movie you select, Transformers is a near-perfect Blu-Ray demo reel. There's never a loss of clarity, grain, or weak blacks.

The only issues visible are very, very rare instances of colors being too sharp in the earlier portions of the film before the CGI kicks in, resulting in some odd tones for a split-second. It surpasses Jumper as the best-looking release, which is not an easy task.

Added on to the home theater-showcasing video aspects is an incredibly well-done audio track. On the HD-DVD release, we were given Dolby Digital-Plus Surround, but on this newer Blu-Ray release they've upped the ante by providing a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround track (48kHz/24-bit). The subwoofer keeps busy the entire movie, and the dialog is pitched perfectly in regards to the louder effects. Unlike many action films where you have to play ""Let's Adjust the Audio!"" throughout the feature, Transformers hits the mark perfectly in terms of keeping voices and effects on a nice equilibrium.

EXTRAS

Much like the HD-DVD release, Transformers on Blu-Ray serves up a plethora of special features in the two disc set. With the movie comes a Michael Bay commentary, which may be the only time I've ever enjoyed hearing the man talk. (Other than his FiOS commercial.) He pokes fun at his own product, and offers a lot of nice little stories about the making of the movie.

The second disc is where most of the goodies are. Two documentaries (""Our World,"" and ""Their War"") are the biggest dogs on the disc, and offer a great look into the world of the movie, and how it came to be. Our World is my favorite of the two, as it offers a good look into the history of Transformers and how the movie came to be, while Their War seems to focus more on the technology aspect of the CGI and the robot creation. Both are entertaining in their own rights, though. The other video feature on the disc is a behind-the-scenes look at the dessert fight with Skorponok, from storyboard to post. It's entertaining to see how the first big battle vs humans was made, but it's not nearly as inviting as the longer, 2+ hours of documentary video.

If that doesn't seem like enough, the movie has some new, Blu-Ray exclusive extras as well. Rather than traditional PIP tracks, the track on Transformers (calleed the H.U.D.) is a catch-all of facts, trivia, and other random tidbits. The plethora of information ensures that you never see the same thing twice (until you run through everything once), but it's very haphazard. With no on-spot visits or actual consecutive commentary, it's like watching Pop Up Video: Transformers. Entertaining, but tiresome.

The other during-viewing feature is much more inviting. Coined the BD-Live ""Intelligence Center,"" it allows you to watch the movie with several possible widgets running. These widgets perform tasks from keeping track of robot names and stats (like watching a live-action videogame), to a GPS tracker showing where action is happening. My favorite is another random-factoid type thing, which constantly points out little facts you may not necessarily care about, but will be entertained by nonetheless. In addition, there are also BD-Live features giving you a full 360 degree view of all robot models in the movie, as well as ""MyClips,"" which allows viewers to share their favorite Transformers moments with their friends.

CONCLUSION

To say that the Transformers Blu-Ray release is massive would be a gigantic understatement. It is, without question, the most ambitious Blu-Ray release yet. While the movie is run-of-the-mill action shtick we're all used to, the effects are so vivid and lifelike in this latest HD release that most people really won't care. When you have the best video available in the world for a home theater, some of the best audio, and one of the biggest and most unique selection of special features... What's not to like? If you own a Blu-Ray player and an HDTV, this is the biggest no-brainer must-buy the format has seen thus far.

1611414,5,B00005JPNO,"I expected this movie to suck. I was never a fan of the toys or television series. however, I was extremely surprised by the movie. Not only did I like the movie, but it made me a fan of everything Transformers. The movie was not too corny nor was it too serious. There was a perfect blend of fun, story, and action, and that is what impressed me about this film. It made giant robots quite cool. There is a lot of replay value to this film, even if it is almost 2 1/2 hours long. I love long movies, especially if they are done right. My only complaint about the film is that I really wish that there was more character development between robots. All in all this was an excellent movie that can be appreciated by all ages.
Believe it or not, my favorite part about this movie was the soundtrack. The music is intense and powerful. I believe that the same person that does the score for the movie is the one that does the Gears of War 2 soundtrack (a Xbox 360 game). So if you liked that music you should get the soundtrack to this movie.",1249689600,,1039,4.174129353233831

Because it IS amazing! The overdone CGI effects, the unnecessary slow-mos on Megan Fox, the acting of the unlikeable Shia LeBouf and the weak jokes make this a film NOT to be forgotten!

1611438,5,B00005JPNO,"When I first saw the trailer for Transformers, I cringed.  A movie based on a toy line and Saturday morning cartoon from the 80's?  How good could it possibly be?  The next trailer actually impressed me though, so I decided to go see it and was very pleasantly surprised.  Maybe because my expectations were so low, I was actually quite impressed with how well the movie turned out.  In fact, it has become one of my all-time favorite films.  No, the dialogue isn't the greatest, but it's really not that bad either.  The robot battles are definitely the highlight, but really, shouldn't they be?  The CGI was excellent and the robot designs were beautiful (I found most of the changes from the cartoon series to be a good thing myself).

1611440,1,B00005JPNO,"There is smart entertainment, the kind that conceals little hidden somethings as you are watching it, and then there is overblown non-sense like this. Transformers? are you kidding me? I feel old now. I still remember the commercial jingle when I was growing up in the '80s, and you are telling me I should get excited about this overpriced, washed-up, unoriginal, brain-numbing, and to top it off:

visually hideous! franchise food.

I thought there was something wrong with the t.v when I caught a glimpse of this in the background a second and third time, then I realized these pigs didn't even bother editing it wisely to make it eye-pleasing. Then again, why would they if they are ramming it down sheeple's eager throats, and they burned so much money on special effects already.
ooooOOOOOoooooOOOoo giant robots! oh my god! they transform, get it?!

For real entertainment with a kick, and a boom, and some explosions, and all the stuff you like check out Final Fantasy or go back in time. There are ageless classics and wonderful movies come out now and then, but you won't hear about them because THEY want you to pay for recycled ideas.

And no, the story, or plot, or acting, nothing saves this or gives you your money back. This is more like the movie soccer moms and well, I guess the majority of the population with kids, will appreciate just because they won't shut up about it and you want them to leave you alone for what felt like 3 hours of my precious life.",1247184000,3,1477,4.625954198473282

1611443,1,B00005JPNO,Michael Bay is a hack. They made the whole movie silly and cliche. They gave no personality to the robots at all. The design of the robots was awful. It was hard if not impossible to make out what was going on in the fight scenes. Megatron doesn't even transform into a gun! The product placement was blatant and repeated constantly. It played like a GM commercial. Tried too hard to be funny. Didn't take the franchise seriously. It put the transformers into a typical cliched plot. Normal schmuck comes into contact with something crazy on accident and now the world is in danger and he has to help the robots save the planet while trying to get the hot girl YAWN!

Rated locally as [M] for Mature audiences (excessive violence), so that means it may not reach it's ideal target audience. I found it mildly entertaining, but a complete throw away popcorn flick that I never need to see again.

If you like the movies Will Smith is in then you probably will like this, if not watch a good action movie like The Matrix, Iron Man, Brotherhood of the Wolf, or Wanted.",1245283200,3,474,4.0
1611447,5,B00005JPNO,"After watching the TV show as I was growing up, I was tremendously against ever seeing this movie because I thought it would completely ruin my childhood memories. My brother finally convinced me that this was indeed a good movie, and he was right.

First thing's first, the dialogue isn't Gone with the Wind. It's mediocre at best and sometimes really bad. But there's also some bright spots, and some subtle humor in lines from Optimus Prime that I really enjoyed.

The human characters are mostly very well played. Although I think the leader of the secret government agency in the movie is written very poorly. I wanted that guy to get crushed by an Autobot or Decepticon immediately. John Voight is, as always, perfect in his role as the Secretary of Defense. Although I have to admit I'm biased in his favor in the first place, I've loved everything he's done on screen. Shia Lebeouf gives a credible performance as the main human character Sam. I also appreciated that the character seemed to grow by the end of the movie. At the beginning it's pretty clear Lebeouf's character is a complete weenie who's totally afraid of Megan Fox's character and hardly is able to talk to her. By the end he's grown up some. I like it when there's at least some attempt at character development in an action movie.

However, the action scenes are what makes this movie great. The explosions are tremendous as is the destruction. The movie also I think doesn't stray into too much action or violence just to have another explosion. To me, every action scene was well done and appropriate.

The best thing I took away from this movie is a new found appreciation and caring for The Transformers and the Autobots in particular. The movie not only didn't destroy my memories of what I watched as a kid, it gave me a new appreciation of the story. I think if a skeptical Transformers fan gave this movie a chance they'd find the same thing I did, that it's very well done and doesn't do a disservice to what we all remember watching as kids.",1244764800,,2028,4.593922651933702

1611481,5,B00005JPNO,"Like many, i was skeptical over the ""hype"" surrounding Blu-ray. So i set up my own ""experiment"" - which was simply to have a 2 copies of Transformers - 1 in Blu-Ray and 1 DVD, and obviously have my Sony DVD Player[Upscaling with HDMI] and my PlayStation3 set up respectively. I switched back and forth throughout the movie, and i must say, the picture quality was absolutely superb in Blu-Ray. While the DVD was sharp and vivid, Blu-Ray simply added a whole new viewing dimension with its crisp, spectacular rendering - particularly in the special effects department. Even rudimentary scenes such as conversations were a pleasure to watch. Considering the negligible price difference between DVD's and Blu-Rays, it just makes sense to purchase the Blu-Ray version, particularly for big budget special effects movies like Transformers, The Dark Knight and Iron Man.

How long will the technology be around is anyone's guess. But even after all these years, people still cling on to LP's, Laser Discs, DiVX and 8 Track Tapes! At the end of the day it boils down to personal choice. Only serious movie buffs like myself with a sharp eye for detail, and appreciation for special effects film-making are most likely to be the ones to truly appreciate this next step in viewing technology. However, until Blu-Ray players become more affordable - and therefore widespread -  for most people DVD's will suffice.",1243987200,,1403,4.9914529914529915

1611483,4,B00005JPNO,"Yeah, the entire movie is dumb, but it's also extremely entertaining.  I loved the cartoon as a kid, and I think they did a great job translating it to the screen, although the cartoon never really needed humans to make it interesting.  I was skeptical the movie would be enjoyable, but there were two scenes in the film where I nearly wet myself with glee.  The first time occurs in the opening scene when we see the first transformation.  The second time is the first time we see Bumblebee transform into a different car.  Both were extremely cool.  And the special effects in this movie are top-notch.

My only real problem with the movie is the ""masturbation"" scene.  It is the funniest scene in the movie, but it's also out of place.  I can only imagine how many parents let their kids watch the movie.  I'm sure there were a number of uncomfortable questions.",1243468800,,865,4.558441558441558
1611484,3,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay has an amazing penchant for goofy, over-blown pyrotechnic militaristic spectacles. His first outing, Independence Day, was a god awful mess. So badly written plotted and xenophobic/jingoistic that it led to quite a few internet lists of ""what I learned from independence day.""

The sad fact of the matter is Michael Bay has all the sensibilities and moral depth of a 13 year old comic book junkie. Its said though that true art is accomplished when an artist meets the limitations of the medium and uses them to their best advantage. I just finally saw the Transformers movie and it is a perfect 13 year old fantasy. Michael Bay met and used his own limitations in this film and, wonders of wonders, it works.

This is not a deep movie. In fact its a goofy, over-blown pyrotechnic militaristic spectacle. But its exactly what every kid imagined while playing with his Transformers and watching it unfold on screen is surprisingly fun, even for an adult.",1243123200,,965,4.842424242424243

1611487,4,B00005JPNO,"Before Bad Boys 2 and The Island, I really had no connection with Michael Bay films.  Would I have been happy for him to take up a major franchise? No.  I would assume that he'd mess up any superhero, comic book, toy hero movie.  Transformers, in a sense, proved me wrong.  It may have some cliche elements, but for the most part the Michael Bay disease is well treated and the patient recovers just fine.

Transformers, is one of those movies that you have to watch at home a second time to fully enjoy the film.  I didn't really enjoy the theater experience, because I couldn't tell what the hell was going on, or who was causing the hell.  After I watched it on Blu-ray a couple times, I began to like the film more after I could fathom the events.

I loved the action, and the plot really just wasn't splashed together.  I have the most respect for the animation, which is of the best I've seen, and Shia LeBeouf's performance.  The other actors create that cliche mood, but Shia seems to slap some reality into the picture.  I was impressed.

The special features on this Blu-ray were very appeasing.  I got hours of behind the scenes, and I didn't get Universal's annoying U-Control.  Paramounts/Dreamworks picture in picture and Transformers HUD were very comfortable.  I think some companies are still wondering how to lay out the Blu-ray features, but they should take notes from this Blu-Ray.

Transformers:  Some will hate it, Some will love it.  I disliked it at first, but after watching it a second time I managed to get past what I consider Cliche Bay before.  I hope he takes his actors more seriously in the sequel, and creates action scenes that move fluidly.  The actors should follow suit from LeBeouf, as I stated earlier.  I'm glad if I managed to help you decide on this flick, but I will say that the harsher the critic, the worse this movie will seem.  I'm take a more liberal approach, and I managed to really respect this film, even though it may not be the best written.  It has a lot of good sci-fi action that will shock and awe with special effects.",1242172800,,2080,4.502673796791444
1611508,3,B00005JPNO,"This movie is the most ludicrous piece of idiotic nonsense ever created, and probably the most expensive.  The dialog is a joke, the plot holes are as big as meteoric craters, the acting is completely uneven (although the two young leads did a great job), and the whole thing just makes no damn sense.

That being said, this is also one of the most visually impressive spectacles of all time, and it has to be seen to be believed.  The sheer bravura of the action sequences, in which the camera weaves through the scenes as fast as the robots, is jaw dropping.  The design of the robots, their movements and the detail that is packed into their bodies, is a technical achievement that boggles the imagination.  The sound design is flawless.  The seamless integration of the digital effects, traditional effects, actors and sets is never less than perfectly convincing.

The giant scale of this film is breathtaking.  The fact that all this giant physicality is conveyed in a thoroughly credible, visceral-feeling way is an amazing accomplishment of human creativity and effort--and represents the current pinnacle of the craft of film making.  It is hard to believe that it is even possible to construct moving images and sounds of this scale, complexity and believability.

Too bad it is all at the service of a pitifully simple-minded story and script- at some points the absurdity of the dialog and the hammy acting makes you embarrassed to even be watching.  The technical brilliance required to create such a film is hard to reconcile with the staggeringly naive filmed presentation of the basic functioning of simple electronic devices such as computers, radios, etc.  The views of human nature, of adolescent boy-girl relationships, of the US military, and of technology itself, that are represented in this film are so mind-numbingly banal and disgusting that one shudders to consider: do the film-makers know they are talking down to the audience?  Or do they actually think people are stupid enough to watch this garbage with a straight face?  Or, even more frightening: how many people ARE watching this with a straight face?

This movie represents a landmark for the human race: another milestone in our technical and creative ability to convey whatever stories our minds can dream.  Unfortunately, it also represents yet another step backward in terms of the very basics of storytelling: character, plot, theme, dialog, acting.  In other words...I can't wait for the sequel!!",1242086400,3,2488,5.0440097799511

1611511,2,B00005JPNO,"I couldn't stop laughing at the end of this movie. I'm sorry to all you Transformers fans, but this movie is ridiculously terrible.

If this movie didn't attempt to offer some deep analysis of the human condition, if it simply let itself be another meaningless but somewhat entertaining ""good vs. evil"" movie, then I could perhaps give it a better review.

The absurdity of the final scene (I think it was the final scene) with the main good robot thingy talking about the human condition, the good and evil within humanity, sums up the entire movie. I'm sorry, but a movie can't pretend to have some deep meaning when it consists of these terrible qualities: reductionist, beyond-cliche images of ""good"" and ""evil"", incredibly shallow dialogue and themes, and robots that transform into cars.

Now, had Transformers been directed at pre-teens, I would not feel the need to ridicule it. But, as it is, Transformers is a favorite among the supposed ""adult"" crowd. And, if Transformers had stuck to what it is at the core, a silly and somewhat entertaining story of ""good"" vs. ""evil"", I could be a little more sympathetic. I still wouldn't like the movie, but I would be able to accept it for what it is.

THANK GOD FOR BLU RAY! .

When this movie came to theaters I seen it the first day and loved it. But when it came to dvd and I rented it I was let down even tho the story was great. Mostly because the fights didn't seem to flow very well as if it was choppy or something.

Since it's been a while since I've seen the film and I recently got my self a blu ray player I decided to check it out. Especially after I heard that this was one of the first truly made for the format films.
Which makes my earlier comment fit perfectly because it made this movie even better than it was in theaters. The picture is bright, the sound is vibrant and the frame rate issues seem to be completely gone. So they took what was a great movie and made it even better. That should get you ready for when the new film starts in June.

Now you may have noticed this review didn't cover much as to what the movie is about.
But as long as it's been out Im sure you've heard all that.  So I don't think there's much need to add to that.
I do gotta add that I totally disagree with a previous review that claims bad acting (Which there was one or two tiny spots of that) or bad scripts ect.

Also if your a fan of House M.D look for one of the shows newest cast members in a small role in this movie.

So now  with that I encourage you to buy this disk and buy it now.",1240358400,,1408,3.902097902097902

1611554,3,B00005JPNO,"This is a hard film to write a review of, as the story is fairly confusing (buried as it is under several tonnes of heavy metal, explosions and attractive young women) and somewhat lacking in logical coherence. That's right, it's a Michael Bay movie. Sticking on one of his movies and expecting a masterpiece of scriptwriting and subtlety is clearly a doomed venture. When Bay's in the zone, he can pull off a spectacularly entertaining but brainless piece of hokum like The Rock or Bad Boys. When he isn't, he just creates a horrific mess like Armageddon and The Island, movie which are so stupid and inane they actually drain your intelligence from just looking at them.

Fortunately, Transformers (2007) falls into the former category. Everyone concerned, from producer Stephen Spielberg down to the extras, seems to be aware that they are making a movie based on giant robots that turn into cars and jets and fight one another, and as such the important thing here is to have a laugh (because you could take it seriously be respectful to the original stories, but then no-one would watch it). Hard-core 1980s Transformers fans were upset at the lack of adhesion to the established mythos in the film (although the return of original cartoon voice actor Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime did mollify them a bit). Other fans knew there had been dozens of reboots and fresh continuities for the franchise stretching back to its start and accepted the movie as yet another variation on the story. Casual cinema-goers didn't care and just sat back to enjoy the explosions.

Transformers has several things going for it. It's Michael Bay's best film by some distance (not saying much, it has to be said) and there's a solid sense of humour attached to the picture with some genuinely funny comedic moments sold by a solid lead performance by Shia LeBeouf, who manages to do some good work with some pretty ripe lines. Megan Fox is similarly inoffensive as the female lead Mikaela, whilst there are some good supporting performances from the likes of Jon Voight and Kevin Dunn. But let's be honest here, you don't watch Transformers for the human performances, you watch it for the giant robots throwing one another around, and on that level the movie is a qualified success. There's not that much Transformer carnage in the first half of the movie, probably a result of even this film's insane budget not quite being enough to cover two solid hours of CGI robot mayhem, but what there is okay. In terms of the continued development and advancement of Hollywood special effects, Transformers is probably the biggest step forward since The Return of the King.

There are problems, however. The action is impressive but Bay is paradoxically fond of both unnecessary slow-motion shots and also insane rapid-cuts. These two factors combined make it almost impossible to follow what's going on (especially on the big screen), as least not until a second or third viewing. The design of the Transformers is notable and different, but by going for a 'realistic robot' look rather than the stylised approach that every other iteration has taken to date, the robots lose some of their character and it's often hard to tell them apart from one another. Also, some of their appearances (most notably Frenzy) bring to mind Johnny Five from Short Circuit, which is not so great an association. Solid attempts are made to bring some life to each individual Transformer, but only really Optimus Prime and Bumblebee get any distinctive sense of character given to them. We know Ironhide likes to blow stuff up and Jazz likes rap music but that's about it as far as characterisation for the rest of the Autobots goes. As for the Decepticons, they're pretty much a faceless and featureless bunch, with only Megatron and Frenzy getting any sense of character attached them.

Obviously, again, we need to remember that this is a movie about giant robots blowing one another up. But the lack of decent character scenes to establish a context for the carnage makes the whole movie a pretty shallow experience. When one Transformer - whose 1980s incarnation was a firm favourite for many kids due to his distinctive characterisation in the comics and cartoon series - dies, there isn't really any emotional reaction because he was only introduced half an hour earlier and he didn't really do anything to endear himself to the audience. There's also a severe logic failure at the end of the movie when the Autobots decide to take refuge in a city rather than fight the Decepticons in the open, with the net result that lots of civilians are killed and half the city is trashed. Impressive and fun to watch, yes, convincing or logical, no.

Transformers (***) is mindlessly entertaining with some nice shout-outs to the old-school Transformers fans in the audience (some dialogue from the 1986 movie is recycled; Prime wields his energy axe from the cartoon series in one battle; and an old VW appears in one scene as a nod to Bumblebee's original form). Could it have been a lot more than the sum of its parts? Possibly, but given the constraints of budget and having to reach out to the widest possible audience, what we got wasn't too offensive. There is certainly plenty of scope for improvement in the sequel, however.",1239753600,,5291,4.8484513274336285

1611556,5,B00005JPNO,"This movie is by far one of the greatest CGI achievements of our time, and a 'Prime' example of Michael Bay's mastery of the action genre.  Transformers has elements for all ages and is extremely enjoyable.

While the film shows some, it lacks a lot of the personality and dialogue between the robots which made the old cartoons and comic books so popular.  Additionally, the Decepticons are made out to be monsters both physically, in their actions, and vocals.  This deviates from the aspect of two warring factions of the same species, and doesn't illustrate the relationships of the robots or their ideology in choosing a particular side.  There is also the need of either the writers or Bay to continuously add humorous bits to the film.  Don't get me wrong, there are some extremely funny moments in there, but I could have done without some of the, ""Oh hey, this would be funny, let's add it!"" moments.  It does distract from the seriousness of the film at times.  Love him or hate him, John Turturro's character grated on my nerves from the beginning.  Perhaps this is just how he was scripted or instructed to perform, but he came across as being like an actor in a kids movie to me- not taking the role seriously at all.  With that said, I've got nothing else I can gripe about!  Any problems, you can kiss the ""LEFT CHEEK, LEFT CHEEK, LEFT CHEEK!""

Or, ""GO GO GO GO GO"", or ""NO NO NO NO NO"", etc.  Thank you Shia Lebouf and Tyrese Gibson!

As an establishing film, this hit the mark perfectly and leaves the door open for many more installments, hopefully with more mythology and characterization.

There is some use of the ""S"" word, as well as intense action sequences and scary imagery, but if I were a parent, I would let my kids watch this without any concern.  I mean c'mon.. it's Transformers!",1238198400,,1810,4.557275541795666

1611569,1,B00005JPNO,"I'm not going to repeat some of the negative points other reviews have made well. But, I will say no respect was given really to transformers traditions.

What made transformers great was how human autobots and decepticons can be. Bay failed hard in developing the true characters of the movie: the transformers themselves.

The transformations were disorienting, and the depictions looked very baroque and alien-like. The transformers became unapproachable and difficult to look at. More importantly though, they became lifeless. Just a boil-down resorting to stupid scenes and one-line quips.

In some of the best transformer episodes of the 80's, we followed Spike along as he successfully uncovered the histories, personalities, ambitions and emotions of both autobots and decepticons.

Bay and the writers should learn from how the modern superhero movie franchises have earned their success. By developing complex characters behind the heros and villains.

Bay gives you overwhelming CGI, mcguffins, and inaccurate character depictions.

But hey, if Batman can be remade/restarted as a movie franchise, why not transformers? Here's hoping to a future director gets it right one day.

1611572,2,B00005JPNO,"I went into this movie not as a fan but a regular movie-goer. Movies usually work their magic over me in the theaters which usually gives me a better opinion of them at first and this movie is no exception. But sometimes I analyze them and find out how bad they can be. This film is also no exception. Since I'm writing a review this late in the game, I won't hold back on revealing plotlines.
First the good. The action and special effects in this movie are astonishing, ground breaking, all that good stuff. It's so loud and mind-numbing. Looks and sounds awesome on Blu-Ray. That's about it.
Now comes the juicy stuff. As the title implies, the movie isn't a movie. It's a commercial. It was kind of annoying to have Michael Bay boast about how cheap it was to make his movie when over half of it was product placement. ""Hey let's turn everything teenagers love into deadly robots.""
Another problem (for some people) is that the film has a kind of nationalist feel to it. The movie practically opens on a conversation about how a hispanic soldier isn't allowed to speak his native language. And I know Michael Bay is fond of the American millitary, but I wasn't fond of how they were portrayed. It's of course alright to have the millitary in your movie (I have nothing against them and feel that they're brave and honorable) but it felt like he was saying ""Look at these fine men (can't remember any women)and how they never ever fail and never have any problems and actually stand a chance against giant robots."" Plus a little too much time was spent on them.
I know some fans were disappointed by how much time was spent on the human characters, but I wouldn't know how much should have been spent on the Transformers. People have noticed how Bay likes to give African American alot of parts, which is awesome, but some critics have said that they are portrayed badly. Mainly that Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson are raving lunatics. You can be the judge on that one, since I don't really have an opinion on that one.
I'll admit that I laughed the first time I saw the humorous parts, but the second time it was like ""This is stupid, stop wasting time.""
Overall the worst thing about this movie is that it sends a bad message to everyone. Since so many people like it, it sends the message that all we care about is endless explosions with little to no substance behind it, smokin hot babes, flashy cars, and thinking our country is superior.
And since it's such an American movie it can kind of give us a bad name.",1235174400,2,2521,4.458874458874459

1611575,5,B00005JPNO,"First of all, let me say that I've never watched a single Transformers cartoon episode, and prior to seeing the movie, I knew nothing about the concept of Transformers (other than it was a kids' toy where cars turn into robots).  Never in a million years would I expect to enjoy a movie with such a childishly silly concept.  My normal movie preferences are usually a lot more serious, more important concepts, more relevant to real life, and I rarely find any value in campy movies based on childish fantasy.  I figured that there would be NO WAY that something like Transformers would ever appeal to me in any way, shape, or form.

Wow, was I wrong.

This movie is amazing!!  I've watched it at least 15 times in the last two months, and each time, I get more out of it.

The entire concept of the movie IS silly, yes.  But, the directing and editing of the movie is a PERFECT blend of sillyness with action and an excellent plot.  In fact, it's the silly campyness that makes the movie work.  If the movie was directed and edited TOO seriously, it would collapse.  If the movie was directed and edited TOO campy, it would just be a big budget failure.  But, to my pleasant surprise, they really pulled off the phenomenal blend of comedy, action, seriousness, sillyness, campyness, etc., to make the movie work on all levels.  I am STUNNED that this movie is so excellent.

There really is no way to write commentary about the plot and do it justice.  This is one of those movies that you just need to see.

I have no idea how they got this movie made.  Can you imagine how the conversation went?  ""So, we'd like to make a movie out of this kids' toy, we want an all star cast and $150-million to make it.""  Like, WHAT?  $150-million for a movie with the opening credit that says ""brought to you by HASBRO""??  I'm glad I wasn't on that movie board, or else the movie would never have been made.

Happily, they DID make the movie.  And, they pulled off the concept of having enough realism to allow the viewer to suspend disbelief (probably one of the most difficult things you can do for a movie based on alien transforming robots)!!!

Now, I hear they're working on Transformers 2 and 3.  I sure hope they don't screw up and make them like Pirates of the Carribean 2 and 3.  Pirates 1 was another surprise... fun movie based on a childish concept (not as good as Transformers, but a quality movie nonetheless).  But, then they screwed up Pirates 2 and 3.  They were too rushed, had weak plots, unevolved scripts, terrible editing, and were just plain uninteresting.  PLEASE, Hollywood, do NOT make the same mistakes on Transformers 2 and 3!!!

In the mean time, I encourage lots of fans to keep enjoying Transformers 1, again and again.  It's certainly the best movie surprise I've seen in... well... maybe even since I saw Star Wars in 1977?? (Before it came out, I thought Star Wars would be horrible, and I practically had to be DRAGGED to the theater to watch it.  Then, I ended up seeing it about 22 times in the theater between 1977 and 1978!)  Maybe Transformers is second only to the pleasant surprise of Star Wars??

1611627,3,B00005JPNO,"I WANTED to love this movie.  I really did.  I grew up with Transformers, even enjoyed the original movie.  I thought that the advent of CGI technology would make this epic.  I was, unfortunately, let down by big Hollywood.

The positive aspects of this movie are fairly simple.  The CGI is amazing.  Robots changing into cars has always been a cool idea that appeals to the masculine identity that aligns itself with the culture of American males.  The action is fast-paced and hyper.  Anthony Anderson is hilarious in any role he takes over.  His donut scene in this movie is classic.  And, who could forget Megan Fox, the hot as the sun actress who plays a high school chick who absolutely owns every scene in which she appears.

Unfortunately, the negatives of this movie outweigh the positives.  First and foremost, the plot is lame.  The Autobots and Decepticons may be battling and in a civil war, but what the hell is this all-spark garbage?  Even though it was made for the TV series years ago, and was also lame then, the movie version bastardized its concept (and I won't even get into the fact that Bumblebee is supposed to be a VW Bug).  Other irritants: Megatron can deal with frigid space, but not being inside a glacier?!  How in the world does a laughable government agency actually capture a Transformer with ropes?  Speaking of that...

Adding to the storyline catastrophe is a forced computer hacking subplot, the ridiculous military battles, and a fictitious group called Sector 7 which has nearly no true purpose.  The Sector 7 presence is similar to the distraction someone with ADD gets when they are reading and they - hey! - is that a squirrel!?  To make matters worse, the entire movie is saturated with corny, forced humor and bad pop culture references.  It was beyond depressing to hear Optimus Prime say, ""my bad"".  It's as if the directors got together to ensure brain-dead, mouth-breathing 6-year olds would enjoy it.  Gotta love Hollywood, destroy any concept for a buck.  Speaking of destroying something, Shia Lebouf may have been in some big-budget movies, but as far as I'm concerned he's the plot plague (Disturbia - sucked, Eagle Eye - wretched, Indy Jones - Yikes).

To sum it all up, the characters are unfortunately the focus of the movie, instead of the actual Transformers.  Most of the human roles are pointless, and they occupy too much time.  Pointless or not, none are portrayed very well, and some are atrocious (I'm looking at you John Turturro).  The movie isn't focused enough to be action, drama, or comedy, even though it attempts to be all three.  Last but not least, the ending is groan-inducing; foreign countries have faced embargos and air strikes for lesser travesties.  It was over-hyped, greedy, and it failed to produce.  Period.  I can't believe so many love this movie.  Aside from the action, the only aspects I truly enjoyed were the Megan Fox scenes and watching the Mountain Dew machine go ape-$*#t.

REVIEW
OK, let's simplify things a little bit. This movie might have been better. It might have been a lot worse. Sharp dialogue, frenetic action sequences and first-rate special effects save this long-awaited adaptation from certain doom.

Stephen Spielberg, executive producer to Michael Bay's immense cinematic gamble, pitched the idea to the studio as ""a story about a boy and his car..."" It's this humble idea that is key to the screenplay's success.

But if you're a die-hard fan of the highly inventive robot characters developed during the original ""G1"" 1980s toyline and accompanying cartoon...don't hold your breath. Even central characters such as Decepticon leader Megatron have been poorly re-imagined.",1231632000,,984,5.215189873417722
1611682,5,B00005JPNO,"This is a great movie.  Many people already know that.  On Blu-ray, it gets even better with the clarity of both the picture and sound.  It's quite amazing how much better Transformers looks on Blu-ray.  I own both the normal DVD (because it wasn't released on Blu-ray on the day of the release) and the Blu-ray.  Even when the DVD was upscaled, it doesn't come close to the Blu-ray.",1231545600,,383,4.492753623188406

I didn't think it would be a big upgrade from HDDVD to BluRay for Transformers but it is.  It is huge especially the urban sequences.  Also, decepticon faces are very visible and you can make greater sense of who is fighting in the final confrontation.

I enjoyed the movie enough to purchase the Blu-Ray after I'd already had the DVD. While the Blu-Ray is better than the DVD, my feeling is that for a movie that was so heavy on digital effects, I would have expected a much better transfer, a sharper and crisper picture on those amazing action sequences.

1611739,1,B00005JPNO,"Nearly everything has already been said and written about this movie. However, consider this for the sheer level of stupidity we are talking about:

Sam's great-great-grandfather discovers Megatron in the arctic ice in 1897; Sam is also supposed to be a typical teenager getting his first car and is at most 17 years old. If we allow for some 30 years between generations, then his great-great-grandfather would have been born 137 years ago (4 generations, i.e. 4x30 years). That means around 1870 - make that 1860 to account for late bloomers in the family. In any case he would have been in his late 20s or 30s at the time of the expedition, which by itself makes perfect sense - arduous arctic voyages are a young man's game. And yet the movie portrays him as an old man! Played in fact by veteran actor William Morgan Sheppard, who was already in his early 70s at the time of production. Doesn't this kind of say it all? It either means that everybody involved in the movie was a moron, from the director all the way down; or that they assumed their audience was so infantile, that they could never conceive of a great-great-grandfather as having been a young man.

Why harp on a minor point? Because it could have been so easily avoided and because it makes it impossible to give this movie any benefit of the doubt. You can forgive all the nonsense and ignore the plot holes for the sake of entertainment, but you don't need to get insulted in the process.",1230854400,,1462,4.555133079847908

1611742,3,B00005JPNO,"While I was never a fan of the original toys, comic books, TV series, movie or anything, I've been as swept up in the hype as anybody else has. Also I have a five year old boy, so there was really no good reason for me to avoid this film simply because it was a Michael Bay project.

I found it very good. It started quite well, with some mystery about what the hell these things were anyway, and why they were on earth. Then the character development was actually fairly okay, although uber-geek Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBoeuf was a bit irritating at first. Never mind, he was introduced at the same time as the shapely character played by Megan Fox, who has a very appropriate name. Everything about the film was fairly good, and at times the action scenes were such that I was thinking to myself, ""hey, I'm having fun in spite of myself.""

The main problem of the film was in the editing - enough to make me wonder if the Singapore release is some unpolished version and the one that will be released on the fourth of July in the U.S. will be a bit smoother... although maybe the thought that Hollywood types would give as much attention to the plot as they would to their CG and explosions is giving these people too much credit. Some action scenes between the Autobots and the Decepticons don't make sense (who hit whom, where are they attacking from, where was Optimus Prime when Megatron was doing this and that, whatever). Other plot points seem juxtaposed somewhat, so it's a bit confusing. It also seemed to be a film that couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be a film about people or a film about robots. The ""characters"" of the robot, unfortunately, aren't very fleshed out, and the scene where Optimus Prime introduces his crew seems it was taken right out of Top Secret (""this is Duchamp, Levieus, Escargot, Latrine, Deja-vu, and Chocolat Mousse""). The human characters, oddly enough, are quite adequately fleshed out, often too much so - sure Sam Witwicky's dad is nitpickety, but the scene when he's trying to find something in his room while the impatient autobots are waiting outside trying to save the world, and his fussy folks are going on about whether he did his chores or not is a bit tiresome.

One of the funny thing about the film is all of its wacky bits. There's a scene where an Autobot pisses on a police officer. The chihuaua is called ""Mojo,"" and there's a rather surreal scene where an Autobot is scolding him - ""Bad Mojo - BAD Mojo."" Then there's John Torturro's over-the-top performance as a government operative, which is quite funny. Sam's parents are also quite good, despite the above-mentioned scene, as a sort of non-gangster Tony and Carmella Soprano. Jon Voigt is in the film, going through the motions as the Secretary of Defense who loses his marbles near the end. Then there's also John Robinson, who played Stacey Peralta in ""Lords of Dogtown"" who has a brief role - probably got paid more here than for Lords of Dogtown. There's this priceless bit in the end credits where they talk about ""alien sightings,"" and say to the effect ""oh no, we live in a democracy, our government wouldn't hold secrets like that from us."" In another superfluous scene, there's this weird interchange like ""hey - there are three scratch lines on this, like Freddie Kruger."" ""No, Freddie Kruger has four claws, Wolverine has three."" The music is generally quite good too, although the re-use of that Kill Bill song was a bit weird.",1230163200,,3475,4.601612903225806

For some reason I had the urge to see it again after I bought my Panasonic BD-30 player from Amazon.com. Wow! is all can say. First, the picture was better than the regular DVD and watching it on my new Panasonic 50"" Plasma 85 model (also purchased from Amazon) was outstanding. This time I was in awe of the visual impact of this movie and think I understood and accepted the power of the bad robots this time. Knowing that the good guys do win out in the end did make it more enjoyable the second time. I think I purchased about 30 Blu-ray movies since buying my player when the prices finally dropped at the end of September and I would say that Transformers is one of my best five. I already own several regular Dvds so buying the same movies again on Blu-ray is a major pain in my pocket book.  Nevertheless, Transformers is worth buying even if you have the regular DVD. I have even watched it a third time now. Some people seem to think that I,Robot and Kung Fu Panda are the best looking blu-ray disks.

With amazing scenes, perfect sound effects, and an excellent soundtrack (by Steve Jablonsky), it is a wonder to behold. Also, the dialogue is oftentimes quite funny. Overall, it is a very high-quality acievement.
  Unfortunately, its moral content is rather lacking. Disrespect for parents and authority is promoted throughout -- by the movie's protagonists. And this behavior doesn't really serve any purpose. I know this is common in movies today, but this one went a bit over the top. Also, whatever people want to say about ""It's a PG-13 movie. What did you expect?"", everybody making this film knew that kids would be the main audience of Transformers, and there were several scenes in this movie that were too adult in nature, and that were really not necessary. Also, there is a rather disconcerting underlying theme. What do the Autobots need to do? They need to destroy the Allspark, which is their creator. Now there's a message and a half! ""Destroy the creator, and the world will be saved!"" I know some people could care less, but it just does not seem that good of an idea to me. Couldn't Michael Bay (who did a fantastic job with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pearl-Harbor-Two-Disc-60th-Anniversary-Commemorative-Edition/dp/B00003CXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island/dp/B000BO0LH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island</a>) think of something better? Will the Transformers now eventually become extinct, because there is nothing left to give their race posterity? And really, how could the Transformers decipher ANY human language so quickly? There is a kind of lame reference to the Autobots using the 'World Wide Web', but that seems a little far-fetched to me. Just because they are basically living computers does not mean they would be compatible with the computers of Earth. I mean, alien world, lightyears away----who's to say that the Transformers' don't use something that would resemble a decimal system, as opposed to our binary system of computing. How do the Decepticons so easily hack millitary computers? And why are Megatron and Optimus Prime speaking English to each other in their final duel? All of these elements cause me to give this movie the rating I have given it.
  There are probably many people reading this right now, who are thinking, ""All right. If you want morals, look someplace else! It's a film, not a sermon!"". It is true that a movie's mission is to entertain, and I must admit that Transformers did a very good job at that. ""If you want science, watch National Geographic."" But this is a 'SCIENCE fiction', not a fantasy. Sometimes, a movie's good qualities outweigh the bad so well, that I will give it five stars. And this movie has many good qualities. But, in my very humble opinion, they do not tip the balance far enough to convince me to give this film any more than three stars.

1611768,5,B00005JPNO,"What more can be said about the film ""TRANSFORMERS"".  The film which grossed $708 million worldwide, nominated for three Academy Awards, one of the top 30 successful films ever released, made Shia LeBouf and Megan Fox a household name and literally had fans worldwide ready for a sequel (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) set for the Summer of 2009.

Since so many people have seen this film, I'm not going to get into the film but I will talk about if it's worth purchasing on Blu-ray if you own the DVD version.

More than likely you watched the film, bought one of the many DVD releases or even bought the HD-DVD version when it first came out.  And the HD-DVD release had many fans of the film swoon because of its video and audio quality.

Well, the Blu-ray version is currently available in retail in a two-disc special edition version and all I can say is WOW!.  Let me first say that the DVD version I had was a two-disc version that had no special features but had a ""History of the Autobots"".  There were so many releases from different stores which had their own exclusive or something with a collectible that really, it was hard to keep up with what store had which.

So, needless to say that I have been waiting for the Blu-ray release and as expected, the film just looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.

VIDEO:

The colors, especially during the outdoor scenes, may it be in the desert early on in the film or during the battles towards the end, the colors are just vibrant.  I was just amazed at the detail that your eyes just starts looking at the little machinery pieces of the robots.  You can see scratches, marks, the sheen of the metal.  I was literally amazed by the picture quality.

AUDIO:

This has got to be one of the most exciting audio tracks I have hear on my home theater system.  Because this is a Michael Bay film, you know that there are tons of explosions and all out action.  You literally hear the explosions and I even went to different rooms in the house to see how much I can hear of it with the doors closed.  The amount of bass during an explosion was just amazing and I really enjoyed how much was put into the actual audio track.  TRANSFORMERS on Blu-ray will just make you feel appreciative of True HD audio.  Awesome!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Because of the version of ""Transformers"" I had on DVD had no special features, I'm not entirely sure what was on the DVD 2-disc version.  But for this Blu-ray release, you get the following:

  * Commentary by Director Michael Bay (Disc 1)
  * Transformers Heads Up Display - View TRANSFORMERS like never before with picture-in-picture behind-the-scenes information and more. (Disc 1)
  * BD-Live Features - Exclusive online content! (Disc 1)
  * OUR WORLD (in HD) - Explore the World of TRANSFORMERS through interviews with the cast and crew, stunt training footage and crew, stunt training footage and exclusive access to the on-set locations. (disc 2)
  * THEIR WAR (in HD) - Learn more about the AUTOBOTS and DECEPTICONS with exclusive access to production design, military advisors and digital special effects. (disc 2)
  * MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE (in HD) - Experience an in-depth featurette on the making of the Skorponok Desert Attack scene, concept boards and theatrical trailers.

I was so happy about these special features and the fact that you get the three featurettes on disc 2 in HD and they were not the several minute type of featurette.  These special features had substance and were quite lengthy.  ""OUR WORLD"" was exciting to see how the stunts were created and shows you how Michael Bay really knows action.  From the camera setups that he's built and just to see the behind-the-scenes can definitely be an inspiration to the hopeful action filmmakers out there.

""THEIR WAR"" is where you get to learn about the AUTOBOTS and DECEPTICONS.  Why I love this featurette is because you get to see the staff who were diehard Transformers fans and also learn how Michael Bay actually learned to compromise with fans by reading the feedback on various Transformers forums.  That was good to know.  But also, how expensive things were and just the overall selection of robots and the making of them were just great to see.  An awesome featurette.

""MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"" is another special feature that filmmakers will just enjoy.  The Skorponok desert scene was intense and to see how the staff really came through in making certain action scenes was great to see.

The Blu-ray does come with BD Live and thus certain segments such as the HEADS UP DISPLAY is which I'm guessing can definitely take advantage of the technology through updates.  Currently when you wath the film, you will see the robots on the left hand of the screen and see their health meter decrease during a battle.  Also, you can get information through these factoids that show up on screen (which is common with some of the major action films on Blu-ray).

Overall, if there is a Blu-ray disc that you wanted to showcase to a friend or family member of how awesome the picture quality and the audio quality is of the Blu-ray and possibly sway them from DVD, ""TRANSFORMERS"" is one of those reference Blu-ray discs.

Not only is it top notch when it comes to picture and audio quality, this two-disc package is just complete.  And the fact that you can purchase it online on sale for a great low price definitely gives you an incentive of checking this film out on Blu-ray.

I can't help but give ""TRANSFORMERS"" on Blu-ray a highly recommended rating!  Not only is it a reference disc but in terms of showcasing quality, of the several hundred Blu-ray's released in the market, this one is in the top 10, if not the top 5 for overall quality.

Highly recommended!",1229126400,3,5739,4.644488579940417

1611773,3,B00005JPNO,"The blu ray version of this movie is far superior than the normal dvd.  Not only does it have more richer color definition and sharpness but I found myself noticing more in the scenes like explosion effects or the blue goo that leaks out of the transformers.  Everything just looks so much nicer and the reflections on the transformers really shine.  The sound is also very well done and I mean if you got the surround sound for it crank the thing up.

The reason I gave this film 3 stars is simply b/c it plays off most peoples nostalgia for transformers but it also tries to pull younger audiences in.  I grew up with the original Transformers and really anticipated this movie.  I found myself enjoying the scenes with the transformers onscreen but whenever the human characters would come around I would wish they would sink back and let the transformers take the scene.  Hopefully the next movie will have less to do with people since they have already been developed.  I saw this in the theater and I was not a fan at all of the teenage humor nor did I crack a smile once.  I understand putting comedy in a movie to relieve the tension but I could not get into it and its clear how they were .  I have got it on blu ray now and still skip most the parts when humans are interacting with each other.  I probably won't watch it with my kids for a long time but I am sure someday they will and I plan on skipping most the parts of humor.  My biggest problem is with Sam and that girl in which I wish there roles were just smaller and less at the forefront.  I understand establishing Sam and Bumblebee but I simply did not care for the human characters at all.  The only humans I didn't mind so much was the troops.

I love watching the transformations a lot to me its probably the best use of CG effects ever.  The overall look is just so complex and complicated I couldn't believe how they pulled it off.

However, I was never really a fan of afternoon cartoons and never got into Transformers.  I saw this movie with my brother in law who would be the type of person Transformers was made for.  I went along relucntly and figured i would be bored out of my mind.  Turns out this movie exceeded my expectations.  It was well produced, the story line was easy to follow and the movie had a nice flow to it.  I came away happy I saw it.
Turns out I liked the movie so much I bought the DVD.  The special effects pop right off of my screen and the sound is fantastic.  This is a movie that was made for a good entertainment system and I have enjoyed the several viewings (I have had to play the movie for friends) that i have recently sat thru.

1611776,4,B00005JPNO,"This is an awesome movie for fans of the cartoon series, Transformers. The special effects are impressive and the voice-overs for the Autobots (particularly Peter Cullen who reprises his voice-over role as Optimus Prime) and Decepticons are authentic and add a lot to the movie.

The downside to this movie, and the reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars, is because of its storyline which seems somewhat weak. It felt as if the time had come to bring the cartoon to the silver screen but not enough thought was given into making the story more convincing.

That said, if you are a Transformers fan, this movie is a must. At the very least, you'll get to see your animated robots on the movie screen (and done very well too) which is a real thrill. Having Peter Cullen voice Optimus Prime again after so many years is icing on the cake :) Watch out for the famous phrase, ""one shall stand and one shall fall"" - it made me giddy!

1611804,3,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" is occasionally a visual extravaganza, but one that is somewhat mired in a story that appeals to (only) the twelve-year old boy in all of us.

Based on the action figures and cartoons (which I admittedly loved when I was younger), ""Transformers"" tells the story of a civil war that devoured planet Cybetron and now has shifted to Earth.  Why?  Who knows?  But it's terrific for the viewer that it did, because the evil Deceptecons and the good Autobots share the ability to morph into perfect replicas of America military and hot-rod technology.  Watching a robot realistically transform before your eyes from 'bot to F-15, Camaro, or 18-wheeler is something not to be missed.

This civil war movie is aiming for massive blockbuster appeal, so it goes for a solid PG-13 rating.  As a result, we get lots of explosions, some fantastic robot-versus-robot violence, and the occasional hint or two of double-entendre.  Yes, a few people get squashed or blown up, but that type of violence is generally minimized (with the one exception where the evil Megatron, leader of the Deceptocons, flicks away a pesky human like a fly, smashing the poor sap into, well, sap).

This is one of those movies that relies heavily on such obvious humor as an Autobot speaking jive almost as bad as that used in ""Airplane"" by Mrs. Cleaver.  For the most part, it works okay.  Shia Labouef plays Sam Witwicky, whose ancestor made a critical discovery about the Autobots on earth.  He conveniently falls for the local hottie, Maggie (Rachael Taylor), who is gorgeous and knows cars inside and out.  So it's no surprise that she insults Sam's Autobot, named Bumblebee, who hides in plain sight as a '68 Camaro.  Bumblebee gets insulted and transforms into a brand-spanking new Camaro, conveniently timed for a new rollout by Chevy.

And that's one of the biggest problems of the movie - it plays almost like a commercial for General Motors.  I'm somewhat inured to product placement these days, but ever so often the filmmakers go overboard.  One easily imagines GM getting credits in the movie for editing, screenplay, and production.

Your younger son may not worry about such things.  He'll probably worry more about the fact that some of the action scenes are too muddled to follow.  Yes, they are amazing, but like the recent Jason Bourne movies, sometimes the action is shot so close-in that you lose a sense for what's actually happening.

All in all, a fun movie with much to recommend it.  But I can't honestly say it's one of the best big-budget extravaganzas I've seen recently.  All in all, this movie is best enjoyed by those who won't wonder what the Autobot is thinking as Sam and Maggie hook up on his hood, with the Autobot helpfully providing the Barry White soundtrack.",1226793600,4,2793,4.845991561181434

In the Cartoon Sam was cool and likable.  He wore boots and worked construction and heavy mechanical jobs and didn't go to high school.

Also,the CGI work is so advanced that yes,though every little part moves and operates individually,the final shot is one of thousands of undecernable pixels smashing into each other.

1611920,2,B00005JPNO,"Okay, to begin, I enjoyed the Transformer toys and cartoon as a child but was much more of a D&D and fantasy fan than the whole robot thing. So I did watch the cartoon and I knew the major players in the Transformer universe. Like many of the other reviewers, I recongize that Michael Bay is a pox on humanity. He could turn the most epic, heart stopping work of fiction into a ""babes and blast"" fest. Even in a Vin Diesil or Van Damme film, there is still something of a plot and dialogue. In this, the viewer literally lives from one moment of action to the next because 1) the characters are flat and one dimensional 2) the dialogue is either hideous or nonexistent and 3) I don't think anyone was even trying to make this into anything more than a big screen video game. If that's what you want, then mazel tov and go for it.
  What's wrong with the characters? Well, I thought the robots were cool and they had much more personality than the humans, and I'm sure for the fans that should be enough, but I actually like to see more than just special effects when I pay an arm and a leg at the cinema. This film follows the standard classic little worm turned screenwriter scenario: dorky guy falls for the hottest girl in school, but she likes wealthy and/or athletic equally hot guys (for this, of course, the chick is portrayed as being shallow, but why is Shia not equally shallow? After all, he didn't chase after Fox because he loved her poetry. Note to young people: shallow guys=normal, shallow chicks=heartless shrews). What is Shia to do? Look for an equally dorky but nice girl and love her for herself? Hey, we're in a Bay film. There literally are no even average looking women (I'm dead serious. The computer chick looks like a young Rachel Hunter. And I'd like to ask about the name ""Fox""; do you actually have to be hot to be issued that name because I have yet to see an unattracive Fox in the media). Look, I don't have any problem with hot chicks. In fact, I'd love it if the American media were more like European and allowed topless scenes on television and such, but could Bay use something other than Playboy for his female casting?
 And to Shia: God, that kid annoys me. Always has, always will. He is supposed to be the little heart of gold guy for whom we all rote, but his schuckiness constantly comes through, and you can see exactly the jerk who you know he really is. He's extremely bad looking, has little talent, and his voice causes me pain. The rest of the humans ranged from unbelievable (the model who happens to be the top computer programmer in the world), over used stereotype (the funny black guy hacker,hot chick mechanic), and the grating (the FBI agents, the cutesy parents). Of course, for sheer annoyance, Shia takes the crown again.
 If you can watch this film on mute and fast forward through all the human stuff then raise the film up to five stars because the robots and the fight scenes were really good. Yes, they modernized the cars and such for today's audience, but it's still pretty true to the classic robots. One thing I must ask, philosophically, to the Transformer audience: if the All Spark created all Tranformer life, then who created the All Spark?

And the now grown-up targets of that marketing once again obeyed their overlords, turning Transformers into the loudest hit of the year!

Shia LaBeouf (from the German meaning ""diffident steak"") stars alongside Megan Fox, who certainly lives up to her name (she looks like a Megan)! Optimus Prime (which the Feds just raised by a quarter point) battles the evil Decepticons led by the eviler Megatron for control of the Allspark, which is possibly the silliest thing ever conceived by man.

It's the most fun you'll have watching toys, at least until Mr. Potato Head: The Motion Picture hits the theaters (Jack Black is in talks to star). Mike, Kevin and Bill endure the lashings of Michael Bay in a must-have RiffTrax!",1222473600,2,887,4.828947368421052
1611943,4,B00005JPNO,"First, the idea of a movie about aliens turning into cars, planes, tanks,etc. is completely retarded...Second, I know a lot of people hate Michael Bay movies.  Third, this movie (omitting the first point) is an excellent showpiece for your home theater system.  The transfer for audio and video was excellent (Remember, we're talking about the blu-ray version not standard DVD.)  This will give your sub a workout (that's a good thing).  The effects were outstanding.  Don't believe me, check out the review at [...].

The dialog and acting (ehhh) I mean I have to agree that Sector 7's complement of employees appear to be ego-maniacs sitting around boasting about their ridiculous government salaries while the planet is going to hell in a hand basket.  Shia L. seemed to be the weakest person in the movie, I mean, at least Megan Fox helped destroy two decepticons and convince Bumblebee to upgrade his appearance.  Personally, she or Duhamel should have been carting the all spark out of harms way and Shia should have been reduced to a grease spot.

In short, if you want intelligent dialog, sorry, you want a premise that makes sense, sorry, if you want a movie true to its source, sorry (I mean Bay said it best:  Having Megatron transform into a gun, before a fight, would be like making Darth Vader turn into a lightsaber) you want to show your friends and family the awe-inspiring world of high-def while annihilating their eardrums, buy this movie.",1222214400,,1459,4.846774193548387
1611944,1,B00005JPNO,"Alright for what is was, the Bayformers was cool, but staying true to the original cartoon, Michael Bay did not.  Wait, what am I saying.  This movie was terrible.  Fans who actually grew up watching the 80s cartoon KNOW that 95% of the dialogue occurs among the Autobots and Decepticons, NOT the stupid humans!  Michael Bay are you listening?  Oh, you're already making your Farce, I mean, Part II.  Revenge of the Fallen???!  Are you serious?!

Onto my take on the Farce, I have to say that when I saw the cop car transform, I was jumping out of my seat.  That was simply amazing!  Then came the scene at the house with the parents.  WHAT-THE-F***!  Can someone please destroy the humans, please!  Pretty please.  Corny lines, please shoot the person who made Prime say, ""My Bad.""  What is this, ""Clueless"" starring Alicia Silverstone?

Now, when I said the transforming animations were amazing I meant it.  It really is gorgeous.  But it seems a bit overdone and overly complex.  Isolated, the transforming robot is great.  But put that same robot in a fight scene in the city with exploding rubble and twisted metal and what you get in a confusing fight sequence that leaves the audience baffled over who to root for.  Kinda reminds me of the scrambled Spice channel--think Jim from American Pie and the tube sock scene; I think that's a t*t.  Now, part of that may have been the camera angles being too close.  Still, it's not forgivable.

Characters. Don't get me started.  What happened to a VW Bumblebee?  Starscream doesn't even talk crap to Megatron.  Wait, we can't even understand that fool.  Where's Soundwave?  Why isn't Megatron a gun of some sorts?  We all know Transformers can grow and shrink with ""mass displacement (Wiki).""  I'm going to leave this one alone since I can gripe forever about this.

In short, this movie would have rocked the 80s world if 1) this movie was actually about the Transformers and the humans that co-exist in their world.  Afterall, the Transformers were on Earth loooong before humans existed; 2) 95% of the scenes and dialogue were among the Autobots and Decepticons--humans can talk to, but only to plead for their lives; 3) the robot models were less complex to simplify fight sequences; 4) ENERGON CUBES to take back to Cybertron! 5) original must-have 80s robots  6) someone would destroy Michael Bay and his Bayformers.",1222041600,7,2373,4.777777777777778

The graphics are beyond cool and seem almost life-like. Shia Lebouf did an excellant acting job, Megan Fox not so much: she was a bit on the annoying side, but I'm sure all the guys loved her.

If you're looking for a loud, visually stunning CGI picture, (One of the better Blu-Ray's out there), then this is the ticket. Also looking at Meagan Fox in High-Def doesn't hurt either.

1611970,5,B00005JPNO,"Let me begin by saying that while I am a Transformers semi-fan (as in I like them, but I don't love them or obsessively follow the mythology), I really dislike MOST of this film. It's incredibly shallow and reeks of fantasical ""Michael Bay film"" moments. To me, the only saving grace is Peter Cullen reprising his role as the voice of Optimus Prime. However this review is NOT for the film, but for the Blu-ray disc of it.

The Transformers Blu-ray is unfairly good. The action sequences are breathtaking, and the Transformers themselves, stand out in amazingly crisp detail. It is difficult to accurately describe, but I'd wager it may beat a 35mm print in clarity, only because there is no need for manual projection and focus. Everything is easy to see and make out and that makes the battle scenes even better. The overall picture quality remained filmic and I was reminded of seeing this in the theatre.

One other big plus for this diisc is that most of the special features are presented in HD, which is a plus that many customers tend to overlook but something that will always sway me towards a purchase. I haven't and might never watch these features, as I plan to rid myself of this movie when a better reference disc comes along, but again, fans of the film should be well-satisfied with this HD package. The Blu-ray transfer of the film alone is 43.3 GB, which is far more than an entire HD-DVD could contain, and what necessitates two Blu-ray discs in this presentation.

Bottom line: Fans who have Blu-ray players will DEFINITELY want this, and Fans who are considering upgrading to HD may want to do so just for this disc. Stores shouuld want copies to screen as reference for their Blu-ray displays.",1220572800,4,1716,4.656765676567657

Must I say i was blown away with the video/audio quality of the DVD. Crystal clear images and audio and awesome extras ... Only one gripe .... Dunno if it was my Home Theater or the DVD ... somehow the voice felt little lower than the background music .. not a deal breaker I am sure ...

Since the colors of this movie is gorgeous, it's quite a waste and make me wonder why they did not check, compare and grade the picture first before releasing it officially.

1611993,5,B00005JPNO,"Wow, with 807 reviews, mine probably won't even see the light of day, however, if you are reading this and you want to get all you can (or your kids) out of this movie then please follow these directions.
1) Buy the comic - SAGA OF ALLSPARK (Transformers) as of 9/08 only three (3) issues of five (5) are currently available to the public, but the remaining two will follow shortly.

2) Watch the Transformers movie

3) Buy the comic - ""Reign of Starscream"" (Transformers) - this is a 5 issue comic book series or you can buy the TPB when it is available in a month or so.

You see, by reading the comics in the correct order, you WILL have a better understanding of exactly what is going on in the movie and it will make better sense. Not that it is absolutely necessary to do it this way but it again WILL make the Transformers experience a better one, making it more enjoyable.

What gets me however is that every single adult I have spoken to says they did not like the movie and I think its because of the back story. Without it, it's sort of like walking into a movie after the movie is half over. You're gonna miss allot that way. Well, the same ALMOST applies to the Transformer movie, again almost. Certainly you can watch the movie and that would be the end of it, but for the serious fan, first buy the comic prequel (Allspark) THEN watch the movie, then buy the comic sequel (Starscream).

In the mean time, as an adult myself, I feel this movie is darn good. Like for instance the scene at the airport when the little robot is sneaking past the people in order to get into the police car, well, he cups his hand/metal hand that it over his eyes in order to hide himself. It was so absurd it was hilarious.

Watch it again, you'll like it. An even better idea is to watch it again with your kids, both of you will enjoy yourselves, trust me.",1220227200,4,1853,4.25

Only thing I got to compain about is that the movie cover was all blue there was not a singel text line on anything, so I think theres a front cover missing?

After the 10th time watching it on HBO, I decided to buy it myself, so I can watch it when I want to.

I have read alot of god awful reviews on this movie most saying they diddnt like it because""oh like that would happen!"" this movie is about robots from space!? of course it would never happen its a movie!!! take this movie as it is a movie.

1612022,5,B00005JPNO,Transformers is the best animated movie I've seen. The detail and accuracy is fantastic. This movie raises the bar for computer generated graphics.,1218153600,,147,5.434782608695652
1612023,4,B00005JPNO,"As many fans who have posted here, I was a huge Transformers as a kid...I had many of the toys, saw the 80s animated film in the theater and have followed the more recent animated ""Energon"" series.

While I was disappointed by the fact that there were only a handful of Transformers and some of the character models (I've never preferred Prime with a moving mouth), this movie exceeded my expectations. And mind you, leading up to this film, those expectations were very low. First off, these types of old toy/comic/cartoon revival films rarely pan out well (remember Masters of the Universe? What a rape job...I would KILL for an updated, good adaption of He-Man!); the other detriment is that it's a Michael Bay film, whom I've never been impressed with. But he surprised me here.

I think Spielberg's role helped out in droves here to temper Bay's action-lust style. Granted, the action doesn't stop for the entire film, but what downtime does exist is filled with good (and much unexpected) humor without degrading the ""coolness"" of the Transformers. It even had decent touches of drama and sentiment. In essence, the plot was true to the original series - which was never overwhelmingly original - but works fine for the sake of this film. In fact, there was some good layering to the background story and how the original discovery of the Transformer's existence shaped modern technology. Of course there are some over the top elements to the plot, but how could anyone expect any different? If you enjoy what you're seeing, let it roll and that was true for me.

I think most people (especially casual fans or non-fans) will walk away from this at least appreciating it as a great action film with spellbinding effects. No sense in giving detail here, but this is a big screen film for sure. Despite how long it takes to actually see the majority of the Transformers, there is good suspense and buildup to their unveiling (especially Prime). And after they have all arrived, we see PLENTY of them.

Despite the film's length, it never seemed to drag on. I'd love to see future installments take us to different planets and have Megatron be revived as Galvatron. A power struggle between Megatron/Galavtron and Starscream would also be a nice twist and ode to the old premise of the Transformers' chemistry with one another. And hey wait, add Unicron to the wish list! What's more threatening than a Transformer that devours planets?

I thought this will be cool. To be honest I had no idea what transfomers were about or who Optimus Prime was(I wish I had), I bought the old movie I cried and I didn't really know the story it's way more sad than the new. Back to the new movie the first time I watched the new transformers wow!!!! I was blown away the story really good. I had to dock the a movie star because well unless you have a language blocker called the tv guardian you will hear tons of language don't believe me go to pluggedinonline.com and look for yourself. I going to list some wrong with movie but don't get me wrong I love transformers.
For starters bumblebee pees on a government agent, there's a part where there's some talk about something sexual,words like not real sure how to spell it ho are mentioned. So if you want to get this for a young child or anyone I suggest a tv guardian they block out language sexual refrence and blasaphems. Transformers movie has it's problems but didn't quite stop me from lovin it to death. I was so mad when it came theaters I was like oh great another movie I can't go see becuase some people butchered the tranformers! Optimus prime gotta love him he's awesome they kept him the same as the old transfomers prime, I love the voice of optimus I have say Peter Cullen is the best voice. Bumblebee awesomely cute, but boy can he put a fight what I don't get is this stuff about him being smallest and weakest. Then you see him take robots like three times his size weak, yeah right! Oh he is also my favorite car ever the camaro 2009 I almost drool when I see that car. The end was some beautiful I had to keep myself from crying and the only other thing made cry almost was braveheart funny comparison but thats what this movie dose for me. I love when the boy tells the girl shes more than meets the eye. That was cute and kinda funny becuase that was the old saying for transfomers. Like I said best ending ever I don't spoil this movie for anyone but,I love it bumblebee wants to stay with Sam. The it makes you feel I want to meet an alien transformering robot and go on an adventure. Wild ride this movie will suck you in completely for two hours 24 minutes not a boring minute.

1612052,5,B00005JPNO,"I am so cheesed off that I'll ave to wait this long to get Transformers, a very, very, very awesome movie on Blu-Ray, because of the idiotic and asinine format war that went on for so long.  I've been a Transformers fan since the original cartoon and toys.  I've had the original animated movie on DVD since the very first time it came out on DVD.  And I was actually DREADING this movie.  Michael Bay?  The man who gave us such wretched CRAP as Armageddon and Pearl Harbor?  Forgetting the scientific absurdities of Armageddon and the HORRIBLE historical inaccuracies of Pearl Harbor, the movies were just flat out AWFUL. So when I found out that Michael Bay would be directing a movie based on an iconic element of my childhood I was aghast and horrified, to say the least

But all I can say is Thank God for Stephen Spielberg.  Watching the movie you can actually SEE points where Bay was trying to veer off into his mindless ""blow stuff up who cares about plot?"" usual directing style, but then you can almost see Spielberg's hand reach in and smack him like a puppy who's just pee'd on the carpet and take the movie back where it's supposed to be.

I loved this movie.  And I'd spent a year or two gearing up to hate it.  That's how good it is.

But now, on to the matter of it being released on HD DVD instead of Blu-Ray.  Such an IDIOTIC, ASININE thing!  If it had been nothing but a matter of which type of disk was simply BETTER, there would have been no  contest at all.  Blu-Ray has ALWAYS been better.  I'll explain the differences below, but, unfortunately for us, a product being technically better than its competitors has never had much impact on the good old capitalism of our great country.  Remember VCRs?  Beta was MUCH better than VHS, but the company that made the VHS tapes and got paid royalties by everyone who used them had a better set of lawyers, marketers, and whatever other slimy creatures they needed to ensure that their inferior product came out on top in the vacuous wasteland that is American consumer culture.

And during the past 2 or 4 years or so we'd been going through the same type of thing again, everyone: another Format War, between HD DVD and Blu-Ray, the successors to DVD.

But we can thank God that THIS idiotic format war has finally ended, the respective megacorps having thrown all their support behind whichever pet project would have given them the most royalties, or made them the most bribes, and now that the dust has finally settled we have a winner and we can finally start getting Blu-Rays of all the movies we want, and the prices will start dropping as improvements in manufacturing techniques develop and the effect of economy of scale takes over.  Remember when DVDs cost 50 dollars?  The prices of Blu-Ray movies will now drop the same way, and before too long we'll be able to get 5 dollar discount bin blu-rays, too.

Yes, it still came down to one megacorp bribing, whining, and cajoling enough other megacorps to secure their own royalties for their own format, and then finally ramming it home down everyone's collective throat with a videogame machine with a built-in player that cost less than most stand alone players of the format by a good amount...

But this time we can be thankful that the format that won, Blu-Ray, is the one that is actually the BEST one.  Remember VCRs?  That time, the format that won the format war was the one that SUCKED.  Betamax was VERY much better tan VHS, which is what everyone now remembers as VCR tapes.

But this time the best format won.

Just compare: current data capacity for Blu-Ray is 50 gigs, vs HD DVD's 30 gigs.  Not much, you say?  Almost twice as much, actually.  And you have to consider that a DVD holds about 7 gigs.  SEVEN.  See how big a difference that is?

But then we wet to the maximum theoretical limits, which means how much the two different types will be able to hold in, say, about 5 years.  And even after that they'll probably squeeze out a little bit more, just because we can do crazy things nowadays.

Blu-Ray will eventually get up to 200gigs.

HD DVD?  60 gigs.

That's a HUGE difference, people.  HUGE.  The hard drive on my laptop is only 120 gigs.  So that means I could back up EVERYTHING on my computer on ONE Blu-Ray and have almost a third of the disk left over, but it would take 2 entire disks to do the same with an HD DVD.

So, the ultimate lesson we can learn from all of this is that the companies that sell us stuff don't give a flying fig about what is better for us, they only care about what is better for them, by which I mean whatever makes them more money.  But we can be thankful that THIS time, in a fight between groups of millionaires and megacorporations, the consumers like us actually won something for a change.",1214352000,,4783,4.452243958573073

1612054,5,B00005JPNO,"What a surprise. Transformers, is sincerely the most unlikely candidate for one of my favourite films of all time, yet it nabbed a spot in an instant. Michael Bay, let's face it, isn't the greatest Director in the world, but there's no denying that he's still good at what he does. He has the capability of creating an epic and enjoyable mindless blockbuster, that when you come out of watching it, you're not sure why, but you loved it. Armageddon is a symbol of that and with its many, many flaws i.e. the dog being hit by a meteor and surviving. You didn't care about the flaws as you just loved the many big explosions and shiny things.

""Transformers"" is the prime example of that. Bay manages to capture the idea of one of the most loved cartoons of the 20th Century and brings them into the real world, introducing them to a whole new audience. I am one of the many fools who had never seen a Transformers cartoon before this came out, and I only decided to check it out because of its big budget beauty. The idea of bringing a cartoon, such as Transformers, into the real world in all of their transforming glory sure was an ambitious one.

The cartoon itself (from what I checked out later) doesn't seem to present any in depth definition of just how these large humanoid robots just change into a car, van, jet etc. So bringing these robots into reality, Bay was set the task of making these humanoid robots as real as possible, as a vague transformation in the real world simply wouldn't do. Thanks to the fantastic special effects guys, they managed to create an idea that in the real world, somehow seems so plausible.

The story focuses around Sam Witwicky who gets his first car, which just so happens to be a humanoid mechanical robot from the planet Cybertron. It's also known as Bumblebee. Bumblebee becomes Sam's faithful protector until his fellow autobots arrive, lead by the magnificent Optimus Prime. The autobots have come to Earth to recover the All Spark, which is the life giver to all Cybertronians and is an object which their sworn enemy, Megatron, leader of the evil Decepticons, seeks to use as a way of taking over the universe. What follows is a very exciting ride in which the humans are introduced to the Cybertronians as they fight to keep the All Spark away from Megatron.

The cast isn't a major ensemble of A lister's, but the voice cast of the Transformers themselves is very impressive as it brings those voice actors from the cartoon to draw in the loyal fans. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime I'm sure is the real draw for all Transformer cartoon loyalists, but unfortunately, if you were hoping Frank Welker would reprise his role as Megatron, you're going to be disappointed. However, Megatron is now voiced by the fantastic Hugo Weaving who manages to portray a truly intimidating voice to the intimidating Decepticon leader.

Shia LaBeouf is suitable for his role as Sam Witwicky, and of course the beautiful Megan Fox serves her purpose of being the eye candy of the picture and serving as Sam's love interest, Mikaela. There are a number of supporting cast involved which add quite a bit of joy to the film, including the likes of Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhmal. The acting overall isn't 5 star, but who would expect it to be, when you're only really watching this movie for the 50 foot tall robots that can change into any machine they want.

There are a few moments within the film that bring it down a lot and I'm sad to say, they're the moments that include LaBeouf. Don't misunderstand me, he's good at the role, but there are times when he becomes quite annoying. Megan Fox doesn't really serve any particular purpose other than being the eye candy of the film as her character seems to lack any sort of depth or substance. The Transformers themselves are certainly the only part of the film that make it watchable, and to be honest I think this film could have easily been done without the human involvement and would have done just as well if it were set on Cybertron.

There are many points in the film with which the humans seem utterly significant and that drags it down a lot. The voice acting is brilliant and the CGI is utterly flawless even if the Transformers seem a bit busy on the mechanical side of things. I loved this movie and it's truly a popcorn flick that doesn't require any sort of in depth thought and let's be honest, that type of escapism can always be acceptable from time to time. I'm sure there's quite a bit the Transformer loyalists would say negatively about this film, but I truly loved it and can watch it again and again.",1214179200,,4606,4.562273276904474

1612057,5,B00005JPNO,"I've always been the type of movie-goer who attends films with the sole purpose of being entertained.  I don't plop down my hard-earned cash at the theater to experience a profound experience, or to empathize with Academy Award-winning noteworthy acting performances, or to scrutinize just how many plot holes there were in any given movie.  I leave all that huffy junk to self-important artsy reviewer-folk who like to believe they're more important than they really are.

""This movie is a profound experience.""  Yawn.
""The actors gave noteworthy performances; dare I say, Academy Award-like.""  Whatever.
""There were enough plot holes in this film to keep construction crews busy for a week!""  Sure.

Yeah, you go ahead and write your self-righteous reviews.  Nobody cares.  I attend films to be entertained, plain and simple.  Nothing more, nothing less.  As long as I've been entertained, been allowed to escape the dregs of living in the real world for a couple of hours, then I leave the theater satisfied.  And, I gotta say, ""Transformers"" entertained the bejeezus out of me.

I'm not even going to pretend to be unbiased here.  Looking for such a review?  Then scroll down to more appropriate artsy, self-righteous fare.  Because there gonna be whole lots of ""Tranformers"" lovin' goin' on right here.

When this movie came out in July, 2007, I only had a vague idea of the ""Transformers"" concept.  I did not watch the cartoon as a child, nor did I play with the toys.  The only ""Transformers"" experience I can remember as a kid was reading a comic book one time where some robot named Optimus Prime sacrificed himself to save all his robot friends.  So, essentially, I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.  What I got, friends, was darn near two hours of wall-to-wall entertainment...and what was, for me, the best movie-going experience of all 2007.

Don't get me wrong.  There were a LOT of great movies in 2007.  I saw more movies at the theater last year than any other year COMBINED.  I hardly ever used to attend the theater.  But of all the films that entertained me last year (from ""TMNT""...to ""Spider-Man 3""...to ""Enchanted""...to ""Juno""), and there were several dozen, ""Transformers"" was THEE movie-going experience for me.

I loved the characters, the action, the humor, the music.  ALL OF IT.  I, for one, can't wait for the sequel in the summer of 2009.  In the interim, I'll just have to satisfy myself with the Blu-Ray release of this extraordinary movie, which has been a long time coming for anyone who loves this film as much as I do.

As a final thought, let me just say that I felt this movie was a profound experience, where each and every one of the actors gracing the silver screen gave noteworthy performances (dare I say it, Academy Award-winning?!), and you'll be hard-pressed to locate any construction crews to fix the plot holes in this film because...well...there be none!

Thus ends my self-righteous, all-important, artsy-fluff review.",1213488000,12,2985,4.896207584830339
1612058,4,B00005JPNO,"3.5/5 Stars

Michael Bay's Transformers was a box office smash, but does it live up to all the hype?  That is a big yes-and-no.  Naturally it is loud, big and full of CGI robot action that will have the child in all of us screaming in joy, but aside from dazzling scenes of action and its mechanical eye candy the movie is little more then a popcorn thrill fest that will serve its purpose of entertaining the viewer.  On a fun level it certainly succeeds with top marks and it is a disappointment that its special effects were not acknowledged at 2007's Academy Awards.

The plot is simple.  A high school boy (Shia LaBeof) is raising money desperately so that he can get his first car.  He ends up with on old, beat up car that seems to have a mind of its own and a hardcore engine (how often those that happen?).  On the way he becomes acquainted with a girl who happens to know her mechanics.  But who cares about them?  We're here for robot WWE, aren't we?  The human characters pretty much form a backdrop and help move the story along while we have a robot melee going on throughout most of the film between the Autobots and the Decepticons (guess which one is evil).

Being over two hours in length Transformers just went one for thirty to forty minutes too long and made me squirm in my seat at some points in time, but when the action was in progress it had me paying full attention.  The movie has lots of humor and action and in the end made a perfect formula for a typical summer blockbuster and I can approve of its quality and the work that went into it.  So sit back and enjoy this flawed, but visually stunning film.",1213315200,4,1633,4.294117647058823
1612059,4,B00005JPNO,"To be honest, I didn't expect much from the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Obviously, my sons liked it better than I did--they've got the series DVDs and a huge collection of the toys, so they were primed to absolutely love it.

If you never saw the TV show or the toys, in brief, they're alien robots that transform into everyday objects--usually vehicles, but there are also some other items, like a boombox. There are good guy Transformers--the Autobots, and bad guy Transformers--the Decepticons.

The story in the film is--well, come on. Did anyone go to see this for the story? Something about a boy gets his first car and it turns out to be Bumblebee, a Transformer. And he finds himself in the middle of a war between the Autobots, who are trying to protect humanity, and the Decepticons, who are trying to take it over.

Good guys triumph, the boy gets the girl, yadda yadda yadda. Shia LeBeouf did a credible job of placeholder for the adolescent boys watching the movie. I could have done without Megan Fox's character, but she was there for the boys, too.

The real star, of course, is the special effects, which were stunning. The transforming Transformers were very realistic-looking and the action scenes were mostly pretty clear.

My biggest complaint: What happened to the song? I mean, come on! A whole movie, and they never even played ""Transformers--more than meets the eye"" over the credits or anything? Geez.",1213142400,,1439,4.805668016194332

2. was the story rivetting and worthy of a movie??  [my answer  :NO, apparently with good CGI any terrible story line  can make it in the movies theses days ]I used to think that only powerful rivetting story lines are what are needed to make a movie...these days that is not the case.

No, I'm not talking about the Orson Welles movie from my late teen years, but the live action and special effects extravaganza from last summer...you know the film starring Shia LeBeouf and hottie Megan Fox, and directed by Michael Bay.

The movie felt exactly like the cartoon did: fast-paced action, bare-bones plot that stretches believability, and quick scene changes. It would seem like Michael Bay has found his home...his calling...his best destiny...in making a cartoon-based film.

I can comment on the comparison between this film, and the original series and film. This film is too short for us to build up a bond or connection to the main characters. The new film seems a little hollow--without spirit. This is a typical Michael-Bay-ism...no need to talk about acting chops in such films.

1612097,2,B00005JPNO,"Summary:

An excruciatingly unrealistic story makes you want to beat yourself unconscious with a lead pipe.  BUT, by far some of the best graphical animation there has ever been.  Worth watching to see these stunning graphics.  Expect good humor, and don't read too much into the story-it seems to be written by only romantic nationalist 20 year olds-a VERY skewed perspective.  The graphical animation, action, and humor still make this a fairly entertaining action movie.

Why I love this movie:

1. Graphics:  Duh!  All of these Marvel comic-turned-movies have absolutely stunning graphical animation.  'Transformers' is no exception.  In fact, I think this movie has the best graphic animation I've ever seen in any movie EVER!  VERY realistic!

2. Humor:  Good natured humor that all audiences may enjoy.  There is a resemblance to cable sitcom humor, of which I am a fan of certain particulars.  This helps to accent the action in this movie.

3. Sound:  Very well done sound effects.  Match the graphic animation well.  Really pulls the audience into the action.

4. Action:  Entertaining suspensful action throughout the movie.  Pumped full of missles, guns, and cannons!  This is where the heavy entertainment value is in this movie.

Why I hate this movie:

1. Story:  Absolutely unrealistic; just shameful!  I love fiction stories, but the fictional world has to be realistic too!  Your classic waste-of-time unrealistic hero-always-wins elements are all too obvious in this movie.  These are the moments in movies that you're on the edge of your seat in anticipation, and the enemies, seemingly suddenly struck by a moment of utter stupidity, do not act like you would expect a villain to, thus allowing the hero to win.  Example: A villain who fires RAZORBLADES decides instead to chase the weak hero character and wrestle with him to make things more dramatic.  WHAT?  Wouldn't a real villain just fire the razorblades and eliminate the hero right away?  GET REAL MARVEL... shame!

Transformers falls victim to being another typical Hollywood project that's chock full of the standard thoughts and beliefs of a humanistic, secular and liberal society. Michael bay and company stuffed this film with so much Hollywood fluff that the story about the Transformers broke under the weight of it. There are so many places where this movie goes wrong.

First, it focuses waaaaay too much on everyone else in the film except the actual Transformers. The movie is called Transformers isn't it? We're not given much of any story, background or character on the Transformers themselves. There's almost no connection to the old 80's cartoon and the most history we get to see is in the form of a short flashback. They give us a hint of the conflict between Starscream and Megatron but couldn't give anymore because the movie ran so long on human stories. There's just so much time wasted on the human characters that we're not here to see. If you take out Megan Fox and her character altogether, the movie becomes instantly better. I didn't put down my money to see how hot the director thinks she is with the close up shots of her or to see another movie about teenage romance. About them getting to know each other, getting past their differences and falling in love. I really don't want to see it as I really don't care. Sam's parents are annoying and also get more time on screen than they have a right to. Even the soldiers are on for too long. I think there was so much confusion here as to how to build the humans around the robots that they ended up building the robots around the humans. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 80's and the show did well enough with very little human interaction.

Second, it's obvious that the writers and director here are very leftist liberals who are bent on preaching their secular humanism. Here are a few of the things I picked up on. Sam's mother asks if he was masturbating in his room because he had it locked. She then proceed's to tell him that ""it's ok"" if he was. His parents then discover that a girl was hiding in his room and congratulate him for it. So it's ok for a teenage boy to have a girl alone with him in his bedroom with the door locked? Okay? Then there's a few instances that reflect an anti-government, anti-authority attitude, but then they still remain pro-military as is popular today. Plus a little knock at President Bush, (yeah we know who the voice is supposed to sound like), and it's always popular to mock and insult him. Add to that the fact that the only person wearing a cross is the most unlikable character in the movie and it's readily apparent where the people behind this movie are coming from. Before you tell me ""it's only a movie"", don't deceive yourself into thinking that the media doesn't promote it's own ideas through it's mediums. Hollywood tells you exactly where it's coming from through t.v. and movies. I also didn't care for the cussing. They could've removed it altogether and it wouldn't have changed a thing. The people involved in this movie know darn well that the audience will be a largely younger one. But I guess filthy language and sexuality are also some of our promoted and accepted traits in this country, so here they are.

Third, they want to bring the Transformers into our world today but make alot of the people and situations unbelievable. I'd like to never see another movie where ""joe nobody's"" are suddenly allowed to be involved in a military resistance or are suddenly allowed to see and be included in the plans of top secret, underground, government agencies. Megan Fox's character isn't scared when she first sees a giant Decepticon coming right for her and Sam. She doesn't scream or freak out or anything. Not only that but when she and Sam are being chased by the smaller one, she immediately looks for a weapon to fight it, then does. Come on, are we really supposed to believe this? It's not only her though as it seems everyone wants to be the hero here and has no problem fighting with these giant alien robots that no one knows about. Everyone seems to just jump right into action. Like the earth is populated with superheroes. And they make Optimus Prime our biggest cheerleader. He's full of comments of how great we are and how they need us and couldn't achieve victory without us. Since when did the Autobots ever need us?

Fourth, They only got one of the original voice actors for the Transformers themselves. You could pull it off without most of them I guess but they should've got the originals or at least sound-a-likes for Megatron or Starscream, as they had classic and recognizable voices. I'm glad that they got Peter Cullen to reprise his role as the voice of Optimus but he should've been able to also do Ironhide as he used to.

Fifth, the product placement went to a new level of shameless with the cars and just about everything you see in the film. They could've used some clips of the movie for commercials.

Sixth, there are some moments here that just feel juvenile. The teen moments in school, at the park, with the parents, and the rock music on two of the action chases feel made for a teenage audience. Even as a young adult, I found them hard to sit through. And don't even get me started on the lame dialog. There's not a smart or insightful spoken word throughout.

The things I do like here are pretty obvious. I like the action, the graphics and the Transformers themselves. When they're on screen, the movie is alot more interesting and it makes you just want to see and learn more about them. Why didn't they just start the film with their war on their world, instead of just a flashback? It would've bee so much more interesting. This really should've been a straight up, sci fi action film. I accept the new look of the robots and the transforming animations are incredible.

Which brings me to the disc itself. I have seen both the standard and HD DVD versions and there's a pretty noticeble difference between them when comparing them. They're both very good though and your gonna be fine with either one you choose. The standard disc still looks and sounds very impressive. On a good t.v. and home theater, you won't feel like your missing out if you don't have the HD version. If you want the HD DVD version, which will be the same when it's released it on Blu-Ray, you'll want to have a very good HDTV and sound sysytem to make you happy you paid the extra money. It looks and sounds great to be sure but not so much that it makes the SD version look and sound bad. The 2 are actually pretty close and will equally satisfy.

I really wanted to like Transformers more than I do. But the things that bug me, really bug me. So much, that I find myself skipping through the slow, human story parts to get to the better stuff. That's not good. I don't own many, if any movies, where I have to do that. Those parts just bog the film down, make it longer and make it feel alot longer than it is. I hope they do better with the upcoming sequel, I don't think they will but here's to hoping. I give this one 2 stars for the effects studio who provided the excellent graphics and battle sequences, without those, it gets no stars. If you want a movie about uninteresting, stereotypical people (spineless loser guy, losers ""cool"" parents, ex thief/mechanic super girl, hip teen hackers, soft hearted military heroes, ""evil"" government) in unbelievable situations, sprinkled with some sci fi action in the form of robots, then you'll be happy. If you want sci fi action, something like the cartoons you may remember, and a smart and challenging film then your gonna struggle here. If your not a lefty liberal, looking for another celebration of secular humanism, your gonna struggle even more. If those things are a concern, rent before you buy.",1211241600,5,8081,4.5249828884325805

However, I was extremely disappointed in the makers of this movie, especially with the scriptwriter and everyone above him who approved the script. There is so much foul mouth, sexual content garbage that is constantly being spoken by these characters throughout the movie that I really regretted having bought the dvd for my kids. In fact, it is now in the trash. Transformers is marketed for children of all ages, with all of its merchandise, toys, clothes, etc., however, as a warning to all responsible parents out there, the dialogue of this movie is nothing but trash, and is nothing like the 80's wholesome cartoon. It's like the perverted writer of this script is desperate himself for that kind of intimate attention that he had to sprinkle it throughout the entire movie to corrupt young, impressionable minds. It's a real shame, because transformers should have been made more wholesome, and family friendly like the spider-man movies are, not where you have to cover your children's ears constantly. This movie should have been made more responsibly, because although its listed as PG-13, it is marketed toward small children as well. My 5 year old wants to see Bumblebee after wanting the little toys from the store. Too bad many of Bumblebee's friends have a disturbing potty mouth in this movie which should have been family friendly.

Why did John voight sign on for this travesty? The effects are mediocre at best. Almost all of the transformers look nothing like what they did on the show. Note to the director-Megatron isn't supposed to transform into a plane! The humor was almost non-existant. Needless to say, I almost walked out on this piece of garbage.

1612130,1,B00005JPNO,"where it asks you if this review was helpful or not.

I KNOW I'm in the minority when it comes to this movie. I was a little too old when the original ""Transformers"" toys and TV show first came out. I was in my mid-teens at the time and had little interest in the show and no interest at all in the toys.

However, I have been a life-long sci-fi fan and usually watch or attempt to watch any new sci-fi films I happen to run across. I actually had no intention of seeing this in the theater and was more than happy to wait for the DVD release. As it so happens, I even put off renting the DVD until just recently.

Well, my reservations turned out to be true. After being subjected to all the hype and listening to friends and family about how great it was, this movie was just a hollow special effects tour-de-force to me.

The effects were good, but hardly state-of-the art, but the true weakness of this film was the story and plot. I found myself constantly glancing at the clock to see how much longer I had to endure the film.

Special effects should always help propel the story; not give an excuse to tell a bad one. Weak characterization was also a huge flaw in this film. If I don't sympathize or relate to the characters, or if they seem too one-dimensional, I really don't give a damn what happens to them and, thus, I don't care how the story pans out.

I expected so much more with names like Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay attached to this project, but what I got instead was a 2-hour excuse to bilk as much money as possible out of a once-famous toy line and promote new toys and related products.

In my opinion, the whole movie was a waste of time, money, and effort. I'm sorry if that offends anyone, but it's only MY opinion after all (and I am glad to see that there are quite a few who share that opinion).

Will there be a ""Transformers 2""? Beyond the shadow of a doubt.

Will it be better than the original? More than likely, no.

But, money talks.

At least Hollywood won't get any more of mine when it comes to this franchise.",1208390400,18,2054,4.227621483375959

Some things that made this movie suck: Bumblebee playing cupid despite having more pressing things to worry about like Decipticons, Starscream's lack of any personality especially since he was one of the most entertaining personalities on the show, Optimus Prime tip toe'ing around a garden like a worried soccer mom, Barricade just kinda dissapears, Sector 7 was stupid, the government drama was horrible, the transformers seemed like more of an afterthought since they only came out a few times.

1612156,4,B00005JPNO,"I must confess that when I first heard about the proposed live-action movie version of Transformers, I scoffed at the idea.  Being a hard-core fan of the animated series as a child (and even now), I grimaced at the thought of a live-action movie that I was almost certain would tarnish my beloved cartoon's image.  Having witnessed several uninspired incarnations and variations of the original (G1) Transformers series over the years, as well as several loony live action adaptations of several different classic cartoon series, I figured that the Transformers movie would ultimately bear little resemblance to the beloved original animated series.  Well, I'm man enough to admit when I've made a mistake and I clearly made a mistake by pre-judging this movie badly.  My first inkling that things might not be quite so bad was when I heard the news that Bay planned on not only casting Peter Cullen, who voiced Optimus Prime in the original animated series, as Optimus Prime in the live-action movie, but that his character would also be given a similar physical appearance in the movie, Similarly, the reviews for the movie when it was released turned out to be unexpectedly rather positive leading me to decide to ""blind-buy"" the movie when it was released on DVD.  The wife and I and the kids sat down and watched it together and I found that it was much better than I had expected it to be.
While I can't say that it was a particularly ""brilliant"" movie in terms of acting and dialogue nor anywhere near as good as the animated movie that was released in 1986, the action and special effects were definitely top-notch and there were some quite amusing scenes as well (I loved the scenes with the exasperated operator that the troops were talking to while they were trying to get a message back through to the US government about the Decepticon attack and when Bumblebee hosed down John Turturro's character with oil and Prime admonished him to ""stop lubricating him"").  Knowing that this is a Michael Bay film and that is likely to be more about action and explosions rather than acting or dialogue, you will need to adjust your expectations accordingly.  I myself did not exactly decide to watch it because I expected ""avant-garde"" performances and ""Shakespearean theater"".  Although I don't really hold it against it, The movie really felt more like an extended ""prologue"" meant as an introduction to a series rather than a standalone movie mostly because it was rather slow in introducing all of the principal characters and really (re-) starting the ""war"" between the Autobots and Decepticons.  The impressive battle at the end of the movie didn't seem to last long enough and I thought that Megatron ended up getting killed off way too quickly (although, thankfully it was NOT Prime and I fully expect Megatron to return in one form or another in any future installments).  Also, most of the characters didn't really get fleshed out or given as much screen time as Sam, Optimus Prime, and Bumblebee (sort of-because he didn't really speak in the movie) were, although I would expect that to change a bit in future installments.
Unlike the animated movie, the instrumental score composed by Steven Jablonsky paired with a few alternative rock songs (and one classic 80's tune) is decent but nowhere nearly as impressive as the score that Vince DiCola composed for the original animated movie alongside some 80's rock metal gems like ""The Touch"" ,""Dare"", ""Instruments of Destruction,"" etc.
  Overall, however, Transformers (2007) was an entertaining and an enjoyable movie (""Transformers"" is still ""Transformers"" to a die-hard fan like me) and I look forward to future installments of this series on the big screen.  I would definitely recommend the movie for a rental at the very least but I also believe that it would probably be worth owning if you can find it on DVD (or Blu-Ray if available) for a reasonable price.",1207526400,,3928,4.897590361445783

Well, as has happened previously in my life, I was wrong.  With top-notch talent such as Michael Bay and Stephen Spielberg, the HASBRO toy-line is transformed (literally!) onto the big screen quite nicely, and the plot is actually much more gratifying than I would have expected.

One of the more surprising things about the film is that it feels very much like a military action movie, as opposed to a movie about a bunch of toys.  The military is depicted in a very positive light in the story, which is always a good thing.  It also helps the Autobots engage the Decepticons, as opposed to the human race merely standing on the sidelines while the robots duke it out.

It's a well done film and has a top-notch cast.  For me, Megan Fox stole the show.  She's certainly not hard on the eyes and has an overwhelming, mysterious beauty.  I swear she is the spitting image of a young Jennifer Connolly - right down to her body gestures.  {I actually googled her to see if she could be Jennifer's daughter, but they're not related}.  Megan has all the subtle acting skills down and I look forward to seeing much more of her in future flicks.  Veteran actors John Voight and John Turturro bring an added credibility to the ensemble cast.

Some will say that this film was nothing more than an excuse to showcase eye-candy special effects.  To some extent, they might be right.

1612223,4,B00005JPNO,"Admittedly, I bought this one used from a local video store and my expectations were low. What got me on-board for this film was the opening when Peter Cullen's voice came behind the words! For those that don't know, Peter was the original voice of Optimus Prime from the old Transformers animated series from the 1980's! I didn't even know he was even still alive but I am glad they got him back to play Optimus! I marked out immediately!

Anyway, from that point on, I was into the film. I liked that they kept certain elements of both the comic book and animated series such as the connection to the Whipwicky family (sorry if the name is spelled wrong) and ""sparks"" (the heartbeats of both the Autobots and Decepticons). Granted, some changes were made but not enough to make me hate this film.

Overall, I liked this experience! While I am biased towards the other Transformers film (which was animated), this live action one is pretty good! Worth the price new or used.",1206144000,,975,4.597701149425287
1612224,5,B00005JPNO,"The Good Things
*Excellent action and special effects.
*Lots of fun comedy.
*Nifty storyline; scenes of war in the Middle-East and political intruige are very relevant to today's society.
*Good writing.  They managed to incorporate strong themes concerning humanity (there is more than meets the eye!).
*Good photography.
*Excellent sound design.
*Some good music.

The Bad Things
*Characters are not particuarly deep.
*The Section 7 agents are more goofy than they are menacing.
*Despite the quality of the photography, the camera shakes around and there are lots of fast cuts (very much like the other Michael Bay films).  Can get very hectic.

This is probably the most fun I've had watching a movie since ""Independence Day"" came out.  And for a movie based on a crazy, silly cartoon, I didn't expect much out of the ""Transformers."" But this film is quite excellent.  It has smashing-good action and effects.  The comedy, even if it is a little goofy or wild, is still amusing.  Above all, it's very modern and updated to the times.  Michael Bay's style ensures that it is professional and mature, and not overly cartoonish or (overly) silly.  It's not extraordinarily deep, but it's a lot of fun, and would gladly reccomend it to anybody who likes blockbuster movies with lots of action, adventure, and special effects.  Would also reccomend it if you liked ""ID4""; the two go together nicely.",1206057600,,1396,5.0

1612226,5,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" is an outstanding tribute to the cartoon show of the '80's and a great modern retelling of that fictional world.

The special effects/transforming robots was outstanding.  They even threw in the brief sound effect from the cartoon during the first transformation of ""Blackout"" during the inciting incident.

Shai LeBouf is funny and spazztically charming, while ingenue Fox is just that.  Smokin' hot!

The robots, naturally, took a modern look to them and had shades of their initial incarnations, which was fine.  I was highly pleased and moved when I heard the voice of the man who played the original Optimus Prime in the cartoon series.  A smart move by the director, and an honorable tribute to the series.

In an age of youthful cynicism, western apathy, and a global distrust of the united states, Optimus Prime actually gave me hope.  The faith he has through some of his brief monologues and comments filled my heart with hope... hope for our human race.  Something I did not think I would walk away feeling from this movie.

My only gripe is that sometimes the fights between robots was so swift and fast, you kind of lose your focus.  But that is just a small gripe.  The battle on the highway is out of control.

If you were a fan of the series in your youth, you will be very happy with this reinterpretation of the classic series.

The special effects were great and the movie was good but I do think it could have been better.  The quality of the HD-DVD is great. (Note: you need an HD-DVD Player to view movie)",1205280000,,314,3.875
1612230,4,B00005JPNO,"I will give this review in three parts; one for the movie, a 2nd part for the special features, and the last part for the packaging.

To begin with, the movie was awesome.  Of all the Japanese-inspired cartoons that have been transformed into live-action movies, this is the best by far.  It is 2.5 hours in length, most of which is NOT battle scenes between transformers.  Ergo, there is a lot of story development, both among humans, and between humans and transformers.  The storyline was fairly involved, with a history before the movie, and a future hinted upon by the ending scenes.  Therefore, the entire story is placed within context, both for the human and robot characters.  So 5/5 stars for story and plot development.

This being a movie produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Michael Bay; the special effects are flawless.  All the robots looked real, and their interactions with humans and each other looked real.  Just like great swordfight movies have closeups of swordfighting, there are numerous closeups of each transformer changing from their disguise form to their robot form and back.  These are probably the visual highlights of this film.  So 5/5 stars for audio and visual effects.

Third, the movie makers correctly realized that the original fans of the transformers cartoons are now middle-aged adults jaded by the recent Star Wars trilogy and the Matrix trilogy.  Therefore, the movie was made for an adult audience in mind; not a teenage audience, not a kiddie audience, but an adult audience.  Hence the appropriate PG-13 rating and a 5/5 stars for maturity level.

Fourth, the soundtrack was actually good, though not excellent.  There were several different orchestral themes that were quite hummable; one for the autobots as a whole, one for the decepticons as a whole, and one for The Cube.  However, it was not enough; good background music but not memorable like those in other Spielberg action movies such as Indiana Jones.  What was not good was the occasional tangent into modern R&B music.  So 4/5 stars for soundtrack.

What was somewhat unfulfilling was the comedy.  Too many scenes were added for the blatant purpose of making it funny, with the effect of making it stupid.  For example, John Turtorro's character is absolutely ridiculous.  As a secret government agent, he acts like a clown, in absolute contrast to the other government employees in the movie which are believable.  So 3/5 stars for the comedy.

Now to the special features.  For a 2-disc set, the special features were actually lame.  If one includes the voices for the different transformers, then this movie has over a dozen important cast members.  Most of them are not interviewed as part of the special features, which was a minus.  Also, very little was actually shown on how the robots were animated using CGI; as compared to the special features found on the POTC, LOTR, Star Wars, and Pixar movies.  So I give 2/5 stars for the special features.

Last, the principal selling point of this product is the case.  This is the reason why this DVD set sells at a premium over the regular Transformers DVD.  Yes it unfolds to become Optimus Prime.  No, Prime does not stand up, nor does he turn into the semi-truck; the case was not made to be a functional transformer toy.  So don't buy it for the case; but do buy it for the movie.",1205193600,2,3356,4.826315789473684
1612231,4,B00005JPNO,"Okay, so it didn't have a great plot. It was pretty much one big commercial. (Notice the lingering shot on the PANASONIC memory card) It had the cliched 'hot chic' and corny lines. (""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings..."")

1612263,5,B00005JPNO,"Let me start out by indicating that I am a child of the 80's. I grew up watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Sonic the Hedgehog, GI Joe, and the Transformers Cartoon series. I was never a fanatic (we didn't even have any of the action figures outside of the McDonald's Happy Meal toys), but it was a series that we still regulated to our Saturday morning Cartoon block.

The series then fell by the wayside.

I went to the movie in theatres with no expectations other than that there would be explosions, as promised by the trailers I had seen. I came out on top of that deal. I convinced my family to go and check it out, despite the cost of theatre tickets. We all had the same reaction.

The premise of the movie is simple enough; the Allspark energy source crash landed on earth millenia ago and was buried in the arctic. The Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (bad guys) have been chasing the Allspark in an effort to eithe restore (Autobots) or destroy (Decepticons) the remenetns of their homeworld Cybertron.

Samuel Whitwikki, grandson of an artic explorer, discovers that he holds the map that will lead these giant robots to their objective  in the form of his grandfather's glasses. Before time runs out, he must decide whom he will trust and how he is to aide them in their quest. The federal government, under Sector 7, is also seeking any information anyone has on the alien Transformers because they have the main antagonist frozen in a secret base (and that's why it costs $500 for a Toilet seat!). There are plenty of side gags and Shia LeBouf plays the character of awkward teenager Sam Whitwikki very well. Somehow, even the giant robots are given more personality and awkwardness in their interaction than I originally thought would be possible with CG animation and some giant trucks. If this were still in theatres, I would reccommend you catch it.

I knew that I was going to buy the 2-disc special edition of the movie when it came out. This will compare the two versions slightly, but it is mostly about the added value that the second disc brings.

The first disc is the standard theatrical release that was enjoyed in theatres. Both the single and the 2-disc have the exact same movie on them, so the question becomes whether or not the additional $5-$10 makes this movie worth it.

In short, the disc sells itself. While it is not as 'packed with bonus features' as some other 2-disc sets, the directors and cast give you your value in a very complete breakdown of the creation of the movie and the characters. Some of the composite breakdowns are fascinating to see happen and the level of detail that they give into the process of creating this movie is astounding. I found the extras almost as good as the movie itself.

If you are going to buy this movie on DVD, and I stronly encourage you to do so, spend the extra money on the 2-Disc edition; you'll find that the added value really will be worth the slightly increased cost.

PS: Don't be fooled by the simple boxart. The standard edition definatly has the better cover art, but the interior is what you are after.",1205193600,,3109,4.575539568345324

1612267,4,B00005JPNO,"I fully expected the Hollywood film industry to screw this film up. That expectation evaporated from the moment I heard Peter Cullen's voice over the Opening Credits. I think the filmakers have done a pretty good job taking the relevant bits of Transformers lore and presenting them to a mainstream audience. Clearly, Michael Bay's aim was to entertain an audience, rather than load the film down with Transformers lore. This is a grown-up version of the cartoon I used to love when I was a kid. Miraculously, the film was respectful of the legacy left by the animated series. And considering just how badly the film could've been handled in the wrong hands, that really is a miracle.

Transformers marks my very first purchase of a Hi-Def release in any format (Blu-Ray or HD-DVD). I also have the DVD Edition, so I was able to compare the two. Even to my untrained eye, the Hi-Def version is incredibly detailed. I could even see the wrinkles on Optimus Prime's face - a detail I missed on the DVD version. The sound in Hi-Def is also incredible - I almost jumped out of my chair during the Qatar Base attack.

The extras are pretty good too - not Lord of the Rings Extended Edition quality but still good. Obviously there's a lot of attention shown to the incredible special effects. But there's also a bit of attention paid to how a Michael Bay set is run - he seems to be a pretty tough taskmaster. The commentary from Michael Bay is also surprisingly honest and unflinching.

I acknowledge that hardcore Transformers fans will not be happy with this film. Look at it this way - this is a film that introduces mainstream audiences to Transformers. It's the first film to bring almost-Anime-Japanese-style mecha action to American audiences, which counts as a milestone in my book. I don't know just how Michael Bay and co are going to top this spectacular film, but I can't wait to find out!",1204848000,2,1896,4.636904761904762
1612268,5,B00005JPNO,"There are two types of films: the serious, thought-provoking, artistic films, and the fantastic, sit-back-and-enjoy-the-ride popcorn films.  It's fair to say that Transformers, the latest from action maestro Michael Bay, falls into the latter type.  Loosely based on the popular toy line, TV series and comic book series of the same name, the movie is about two warring robot factions from another planet arriving on Earth to find the AllSpark, a mysterious device that gives basic mechanical objects life.  The search takes them to various locations including the neighborhood of a goofball kid named Sam (played by Shia LeBeouf).  Eventually, the two factions, called the Autobots and Decepticons, face each other for the fate of themselves and all of humanity.  If the plot is too simple for you, back out now.  There's not much more to it though it was more than I expected.  This film is great for the action and special effects alone but, in this case, that's not a bad thing.  Many of the negative reviews are those who either hate the premise or hate the director.  Bay is a director who is all about explosive action (his credits include Armageddon, The Rock, and Pearl Harbor) and for better or worse, his style is in full force here.  Even so, I managed to care more for the characters in this film almost more than those in the other movies combined (though I do wish the robots were a little more developed).  Another thing about the movie that suprised me was the humor.  Although it was borderline teen-comedy type funny, it actually worked well for the most part.  As I said before, the visual effects, which show the robots transforming into various vehicles and objects and back, are nothing short of spectacular thanks to the flawless CG animation by ILM.  In a year that saw great examples of both types of films, I can honestly say that Transformers is not only Bay's best film yet, but also the most exciting and fun movie of the year. And that accounts for both types of films.",1204675200,,2000,4.742774566473988
1612269,5,B00005JPNO,"I was a huge fan of transformers when I was a kid so I was interested in seeing how these characters are portrayed 20 years on and I must admit I assumed like most 80s TV shows, especially kids ones that it would be a pretty average film just cashing in on those wanting to relive their childhood. I was actually pleasantly surprised with the film, it's a pretty good tale and the documentaries (features) were quite good at both showing kids of today the glimpses of the original TV show, characters and toys of my generation's childhood (and you get to relive the commercials for the toys as well!)

The documentaries also provide an insight as to why some of the Autobots and Decepticons don't look a thing like the originals did (an area of the film I was disappointed with). Some of these explanations you'll say fair enough but some I don't think justify changing them. Such as Optumus Prime's a different main colour and truck type, apparently red doesn't come up to well on film (fair enough) and the square type truck wouldn't transform as good (yeah I don't know about that, I think the toy line offset from the film may have been in mind with kids more likely to buy a more modern truck they could relate to). My first ever Transformer toy, Ratchet is no longer an ambulance because in the 80s he was a Japanese ambulance (fair enough but make him a modern looking non van ambulance, why does he have to be a Humvee rescue vehicle instead)?

Apparently the legacy of Herbie meant Bumblebee couldn't be a Volkswagon Bug. I have to admit I liked the older car Sam first gets but thought the newer car Bumblebee later becomes looked a bit unrealistic and like a toy car to me. I didn't like the movie version Megatron, he didn't look a thing like the original villain but should have, also didn't like the CD player robot that replaced (I've forgotten his name) the dark blue tape player with the tapes in the deck in his chest which transformed into a jaguar and bird in the original cartoon). His modern version with no smaller tape robots was too Terminator not enough Transformer for me. So yeah I found the documentaries quite fascinating to see how it was filmed and the justifications for the changes in the main characters, I think these are worth the price of the DVD package alone. I also didn't see why they used a giant scorpion as one of the main Decepticons as Transformers were supposed to be robots in disguise so that humans wouldn't know they were there unless they wanted them to, not like you come across giant metal scorpions as you stroll through the desert (although I do remember the cartoon and toy line at the end of the Transformers fad coming out with dinosaurs back when I was kid, infact I owned the Stagosaurus and Tyranosaurus ones).

So what the film about? Basically an unpopular high school kid puts his arctic explorer relative's possessions up for sale on e-bay to help raise money to go towards the car which his parents will match. The eyeglasses hold a secret both the Autobots and Decepticons have been searching for, for years. Bumblebee had long ago been sent to find it (so hence he makes himself Sam's preferred car by destroying any alternative), Bumblebee summons to Earth Optimus and the other Autobots to complete the mission. Meanwhile the Decepticons have discovered the US military has in their computer databases an audio message that will lead them to their missing leader Megatron and employ a two pronged approach to find him, attack the military hacking their machines and find the human who has put the glasses up on e-bay. Good movie, great DVD, and good on them for keeping the same actor (voice) for Optimus Prime that the original cartoon series had.",1204675200,,3720,4.607843137254902
1612270,1,B00005JPNO,"So, I finally gave in and watched the ""film"". What a mistake on my part.

I was already going into Transformers with very low expectations (and yes, I was expecting nothing more than standard Summer popcorn fare - God, I'm really starting to hate that cliche), and STILL, I found myself terribly disappointed. Stale popcorn indeed.

With the exception of some of the CGI, particularly the transformation scenes, I hated, I repeat hated, nearly everything about Transformers.

Here's a list of the film's many accomplishments (and I'm sure I'm leaving a few out)

- No character and or story development (and again, my expectations were already at a bare minimum in these areas)
- One of the most boring MacGuffin's I can EVER recall
- ""Jokes"" that I may, and I stress may, have found funny when I was 9
- A good dozen semi-slow motion shots of Megan Fox doing absolutely nothing
- A sideplot with Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson & Jon Voight that makes up a good portion of the film and literally stops in the middle of nowhere
- Not enough action sequences for my taste, and when we finally do get some, they're a visual & logical mess half the time
- I was never very excited and or terrified by the situations in the film (for the most part, I found myself simply bored), and I think the Decepticons looking so similar to one another didn't help matters in this area either
- And though I liked the CGI effects at times, there were other times where the Transformers looked extremely fake with respect to their real world surroundings (the back yard scene anyone) a la King Kong 2005

And even in those rare instances where the film does get something right, such as the mentioned transformations or Bumblebee's manner of talking, it doesn't develop those qualities anywhere near the extent that it could/should.

At the end of the day, had the film been 100% campy throughout, I think I could have stomached it a bit more. But at the same time, it also takes itself quite seriously throughout much of it, and that just took the cake for me. It's like watching a dumbed-down version of the second half of Bay's Armageddon, except with large robots instead of a large rock.

While I've never been able to get into the Transformers concept (even as a kid), I find myself pondering how hard can it really be to get robots fighting robots right?

Pretty hard I guess.

1612271,3,B00005JPNO,"Preparing to watch Transformers with no foreknowledge of the property is an odd situation, particularly for someone of my generation. You know there's something there that you're supposed to like, yet you have no clue why, or even what exactly it is. I had done some rudimentary research on the story (Wikipedia is an invaluable tool), but I when I settled down into my theater chair, I remained essentially a blank slate on which the film would write its impression of this highly-touted, yet wholly unknown, license.

I giggled when a credit reading ""in association with HASBRO"" in drastically important lettering appeared as the film began. Something about the idea that this PG-13-rated, multi-billion-dollar tentpole summer film had been inspired by a line of toys struck me as funny, in the same way that I sat in the theater in 2003 and giggled when marveling that I was about to see a big-budget film based on a Disneyland ride. Still, that turned out well. I had the highest hopes this one would succeed on the same level.

The film begins in Qatar (""Qatar - the Middle East"" informs an amusingly helpful graphic), with an impressive sequence that introduces the villainous...something. The movie was exceedingly fuzzy on Decepticon details. The introductory scene also introduces the characters played by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. They're Army men, and I have no idea what their names are. Does it matter? Like so many of the characters in the film (both human and robot), no, it does not.

Anyway, after their base is wiped out by some nameless Decepticon, we're introduced to the actual stars of the film: a robot named Bumblebee and a human named Sam. Sam is played by Shia LeBeouf, and Bumblebee is played by a radio. Well, a radio and a Camero. I suppose they work in tandem.

I recall an interview with Steven Spielberg (an executive producer on the film, and the one who spearheaded production) in which he stated that Transformers was really the story of a boy and his car. And to a very large degree, that's true. Sure, there's a bunch of fighting and epic war and the world at risk and all that jazz (lower-case, not Jazz, who is a horrible member of the Autobot ranks), but Sam and Bumblebee are the heart of the story. One can feel Spielberg's hand on the entire project, but particularly this part. It's as though the film were a Spielberg film, but run through a Bay-ification filter.

I daresay were it not for Sam and Bumblebee, I wouldn't have enjoyed this film nearly as much as I did. Someone forgot to tell Shia LeBeouf that ex-Disney Channel actors are supposed to suck. He may in fact be in violation of some international statutes. Thankfully, he has an unforced charm and comedic timing that saves even the most inane of scenes.

Anyway, once Sam buys a used car (Bumblebee), he soon discovers it's a giant transforming robot alien thing bent on saving the world from other, more evil giant transforming robot alien things. Sam is the key to finding the Allspark, a big Rubik's cube thing that apparently is the source of limitless power, including a world-making ability which the Decepticons hope to harness.

The military is heavily involved in this robo-war, and in fact have been keeping the crash-landed Decepticon leader Megatron frozen for years. Humans have taken and reverse-engineered virtually all technology since from his icy state. Which basically means that even though he has nearly limitless power, we've used it primarily in the search for faster, better ways to look at porn. All this gives the opportunity for Secretary of Defense Jon Voight to walk around and act like the president a lot without actually having to be the president. Also, Voight is dreadfully dull in this roll, and John Turturro succeeds in once again annoying the hell out of me in his role as a secret agent man. In fact, the only time the movie's human scenes don't drag is when Sam and his would-be girlfriend Mikaela (a very hot Megan Fox) are onscreen. Aside from them, I found myself wanting to get back to the robot parts, and being that there were only three robots that had any sort of personality whatsoever, that's saying something.

Eventually our disparate nameless humans converge, and there's an all-out robot battle royale. Which really seems to be the point of the film, no? The battle is fierce, and protracted. It eventually became a bit numbing, too. The only times I really cared were when Optimus Prime (voiced wonderfully by the role's originator Peter Cullen), Megatron (more voice work from the always-excellent Hugo Weaving), and Bumblebee were in the fighting. I suppose it didn't help that those three were the only ones recognizable in their battles as well. Perhaps more color-coordination is needed.

One thing I will say is that this may in fact be the first film in which I was not fully cognizant of any special effects shots. It seems Industrial Light and Magic has finally broken the cohesion barrier, and merged the effects seamlessly with the actual footage. I know the term ""seamlessly merged"" is bandied about a lot in discussion of special effects films, but they truly nailed it with this one.

Was it a fun movie? Yes, extremely. Was it a good movie? Certainly not. It also probably doesn't help this film that I saw the brilliant Ratatouille two nights ago, which reminded me how wonderful films can truly be. And yes, I recognize that I'm probably not the ideal audience for this film. I will say that it was, however, likely the best movie possible about gigantic shape-changing robot warriors from beyond the stars, and it is better than it has any right to be.",1204588800,,5640,4.79320987654321

1612295,5,B00005JPNO,"Filmakers Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay have struck gold with the Transformers Movie.  Although the story line was a little weak, but the movie makes up for it with all of the action throughout the movie.  As a fan of the 80s cartoon series they were smart in bringing in voice actor Peter Cullen who voiced both Optimus Prime and Megatron in the cartoon, also voices Optimus Prime in this movie.  It wouldn't be Optimus Prime without Peter Cullen.  Although it's been 20 years since the cartoon, and since then the actor's voice has aged just slightly.  But it is the same actor who voiced Optimus Prime in the cartoon, also voices Optimus Prime in this movie.  I suspect Spielberg and Bay will get together again for What could be a sequel to this movie.",1203552000,,759,4.5851851851851855

There is a short part dedicated to show some concept illustrations for some scenes but it's very short.

Star wars Episode 2 or 3, and the Lord of the rings trilogy (extended edition) have really nice documentaries, lots of images, lots of sculptures, concept design, digital FX makings etc...

I was disappointed with this ""special edition""",1203379200,,609,4.950980392156863
1612297,2,B00005JPNO,"I never really grew up with the toys, but I have a basic understanding of what they're all about.  So, when I and my Transformer-loving friends elected to watch this movie, we had some basic expectations.  Well, this movie fell short.

Everybody obviously has an opinion, and some people I know cannot even find a single ""flaw"" with this movie, so it is difficult to state my own view without somebody trumping it here.  But, I'll give you the objective lowdown.  It's a typical Michael Bay flick, full of over the top action sequences and ridiculous one-liners awkwardly implemented.  The film lacks a strong plotline and the characters (all 25+ of them) are scantly developed.  I cannot imagine what kind of writer put this movie together, but they must have piled on every subplot imaginable.  None of the bad guys were scary: Megatron came close, but then Bay threw in Sector 7, which were a bunch of psuedo-FBI agents who brought little into the story.  Honestly, one absurd thing piled onto the next (not movie realism absurd, but rather altogether movie absurd) and soon Transformers, what could have been a great summer movie, became nothing more than the Mona Lisa drawn with fingerpaints by an infant.

On a side note, I must advise that it would be a horrible movie for a first date.  Unless your date loves awkward teenage sexual humor and robots peeing on things (and dogs returning the favor), you might find yourself suffocating yourself in your popcorn bowl to ease the pain.

In short, the type of people who would like this film are: prepubescent 11-year-old boys, high college students, old people who don't know what's good for them anymore, and Michael Bay's wife.  Okay, that's all an exageration of course, but that was my impression.  At the very least, don't come in with too high of hopes, because you may be seriously disappointed.",1203292800,3,1858,4.80188679245283

1612299,5,B00005JPNO,"You would never think in a million years that your childhood could be translated to the new millennia in such spectacular fashion.  Forget all the nay sayers who complain about what the robots look like or how they transform or how they act or any of that stuff.  Lets focus on the basics; good vs. evil robots who can transform from vehicle to humanoid version.  That's it!  The way they do it should be determined by the times...and the times have changed.

Transformers was put into the capable hands of Michael Bay sometime in 2005.  From that point, when he finally agreed to do it (which might have been right after he watched his last movie `The Island' fall flat on it's face) he ran with it whole heartedly.  The best part is, he listened to many fans about the old series and characters and integrated some things into the movie.  However, the one thing he DID NOT listen to (and I'm glad he didn't) was the transformation of the robots.  This movie shows it happening realistically.  I mean, you really get to see the pieces and parts moving around and reforming to the point where you wonder if they just melded the CGI parts together and made it look good without function.  I'm telling you now, that is not the case.  Everything had a place to go...watching the special features on the DVD you see the animators creating CAD (that Computer Aided Drafting, boys and girls) drawings showing where all parts of the characters went.  It's truly amazing!

Now, on to the flick itself.  In one word, it really is awesome.  I have watched it a few times now and it actually gets better each time.  Let me clarify off the bat that this is a popcorn movie.  Not to be taken too seriously but the movie itself doesn't take itself seriously most of the time either.  So it all works out.  The plot follows Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a somewhat gawky but still kinda cool geek who's got a plan...buy a car, impress the girl.  In this case, the girl is Mikaela Banes (played by ultra hot Megan Fox).  When buying his car he is nudged into buying a beat up 77 Camaro Hot Rod, little knowing that it hides a secret.  Eventually the car reveals itself to be Bumblebee, a scout soldier for the Autobots; one half of an alien species from a planet called Cybertron that is extremely high tech.  The other half are the Decepticons, who are devoted to tyranny as opposed to the Autobots who are freedom fighters and defenders of good.  Bumblebee is sent to not only protect Sam but to signal other Autobots once he has found him.

A secondary plot follows a Helicoptor and  Scorpion like Decepticons that attack a Military outpost in Katar in the Middle East.  This gets the Military and Secretary of Defense involved as they try to figure out what hacked into their computer systems.  Josh Dumahl leads a small group of soldiers who survived the attack and make it back stateside giving their experience expertise on the aliens.  As the movie moves forward we find that Sam's ancestor actually discovered the first Decepticon on Earth, frozen in the artic.  Sam has a map, etched in the glass of a pair of his ancestors spectacles which will lead them to the `Allspark', an Implement of power which can turn the tide in the war between the two halves.

So as the chase starts and the Decepticons track down Sam, he meets Optimus Prime; the leader of the Autobots.  From there they are intercepted by Sector 7, an ultra top secret government organization that has been keeping the existence of the first Decepticon a secret for quite some time.  From there, the story goes to the Hoover Dam where they are shown Megatron, the one found in the Arctic so many years ago.  This is where everything starts to come together and all characters join up complete the common goal.  Get the Allspark and keep it out of Decepitcons hands.  The actions sequences are spectacular and the melding of the CG animation and live action is seamless and truly believable.  The showdown in Mission City at the end is chaotic, kinetic and downright mind blowing.  You cannot deny the intensity and excitement of the battle scenes.

Even though most of the performances in this movie are pretty undemanding, everyone seems to be in the spirit and having a great time.  LeBeouf, Fox and Turturro do have some great moments.  Especially LeBeouf, whose comedic wit shines in many places and lightens what could have been a drool, horny caricature of your typical teenager.  Fox does well too playing it straight against his goofiness at times.  She also has what a friend of mine stated was the best special effect in the movie...her body.  I am a great fan of Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's individual work.  Both like to do things in their own style and are not usually subject to letting others tell them how to make their movies.  So I was very happy to see such spectacular product come from their union.  There are a couple of scenes that scream Spielberg's influence but hey, when you're the Executive Producer and have a couple of Oscars under your belt, you kinda get your way.  But other than that, it's good to see Bay growing even more with his craft.  This is by far his best movie overall.",1203033600,,5178,4.581066376496191

1612332,5,B00005JPNO,"The movie is fantastic. I grew up watching Transformers on television as well as the offshoot, Beast Wars, and I'm more than familiar with the fact that there were no humans in either show. However, if you think that because there are humans, that it is ""disgraceful"" or lackluster, you'd be mistaken. The film is an action packed, blockbuster roller coaster that screams ""Watch Me!""

The special effects are amazing. I could watch the film over and over just to see the Autobots (good guys) and Deceptecons (bad guys) transform. The explosions and mass destruction are incredibly believable and awesome. The role the US military played in the film should be noted as the wealth of vehicles and personnel inadvertently turn you from a military skeptic to waiting in line to enlist. A little dramatic but exciting nonetheless.

The sound is one of the real highlights of the film. It is loud, yes, but would you want a quiet film when LA is the battlefield for space-faring robots? Sound effects are spot on. The soundtrack is one of the more memorable. Think Hanz Zimmer in Batman Begins. My favorite part is with Scorponok attacking a bunkered down marine force then being pummeled by different types of military vehicles and weapons. The song during that part is especially riveting.

Overall, I highly recommend you watch this film.",1202947200,,1335,4.898230088495575

1612335,4,B00005JPNO,"What would have been thought impossible when the Transformers first stormed onto the scene in the mid-80s - an epic live-action movie - was made possible by some of the best and most real-looking CGI effects to date, and the result is a slam-bang robo-blockbuster that sails past a few chinks in its armor to stand as one of the best big action movies of the last few years.

  The biggest surprise is the overall tone of the movie - ""Transformers"" is often as much of a comedy as it is an action movie, and a much more successful one than one might think.  There's genuine wit and humor in the interaction between the human and robot characters, and in such endearing miscalculations as the Transformers thinking that by turning into big shiny, high-tech vehicles, they can be perfectly inconspicuous parked in large groupings in the backyards of a residential neighborhood.  Speaking of character, the most important hurdle that the movie passed was that it made its Transformers genuine characters (like the comics and tv shows always did) instead as just impressive giant robots.  And the frequently humorous tone of the film perhaps helps it with the 'suspension of disbelief' factor.  Warring factions of robots - one bent on universal domination, the other dedicated to protecting the universe from their more bloodthirsty counterparts - end up doing battle on Earth: okay, a guy like me can accept that.  But they call themselves Decepticons and Autobots, and have decided that the best way to achieve theit goals is by disguising themselves as run-down cars and sitting in automobile dealerships quietly doing reconnaissance, or by disguising themselves as boomboxes and sneaking onto airplanes - yeah, maybe that has to tap into a bit of suspension of disbelief.  But, impressively, it works.

  In this incarnation of the Transformers story, both factions are on Earth in search of the Allspark (the 'key' that can create new Transformer life), which was lost on Earth nearly a century ago when a previous robotic visitor vanished without a trace.  The lead human characters that get drawn into this are Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf), who's unknowingly in possession of a clue to the Allspark's current whereabouts, and through him his classmate/object-of-desire Mikaela (Megan Fox) and parents Ron and Judy Witwicky (Kevin Dunn and Julie White).  These four play their roles great and really make the comedic angles of the movie work where otherwise those parts might have fallen right on their face.  Credit must also be given to the voice actors of the various robots, who really make them come to life.  Of course, with both sides on Earth, it's only a matter of time before the titanic confrontations start taking place.

  Okay, now the negatives.  I can see human military fighter bombers and battleships and so on posing a genuine challenge for the Transformers, not necesarily defeating the big guns like MegaTron and Optimus Prime obviously, but putting up a good fight.  However, in a movie like this, the human soldiers should NOT be running around with handheld weapons that can damage and knock down large Transformers, and I don't care how sophisticated the computer programs were that they used to analyze what kind of shots were likely to have the most effect. They're really going to have to correct that in the sequel, somehow.  This is just one of the ways the movie, in its end portion runs into the old problem where everything suddenly becomes 'too easy'.  They're coming to the movie's end and they need something to really turn the tide against the Decepticons fast?  Bring in Omega Supreme.  Don't have little shotgun-size, human-made weapons, all of a sudden become way too potent.

  In spite of this, it's a great show that really re-ignited my Transformer interest (that had never died out, but kind of got shifted to a rather far-back burner after ""Beast Wars"" ended).  Now I'm going to have to go and track down more of the more recent comics, and try and get ""Beast Machines"" on DVD.

  Quality human characters, classic Transformer favorites like Optimus, MegaTron, Starscream, Bumblebee, and Ironhide, and tremendous special effects (when a vehicle turns into a robot, you really Can't tell where the live action ends and the CGI begins), plus the way it really refreshed the Transformers concept for me and made me hungry for more, gets this one a four-star rating easy.

1612337,1,B00005JPNO,"Being a child of the 80's I watched the Transformers cartoon. I am no expert on the characters or the history of them, but I got the gist of it well enough. I refused to see this in the theatre, because it is a Michael Bay movie and we all know his stuff is never worth the price of a ticket. I like to watch his movies in an environment where I can yell at the screen ""you've got to be kidding me"" and pause and rewind and just plain roll around on the floor and laugh. Transformers didn't fail in that department, it stunk so wonderfully.

I don't even know the plotline, because I really couldn't grasp what the heck was going on. The special effects were pretty ""special"" and by that I mean they have an Olympics just for them. I know that some of these people can really act, given the right script and director, but you wouldn't ever know watching this. I felt like a lot of it was improved.  I am not sure exactly who this was geared towards, old school 80's adults, 10 year old boys, Teenagers, drunk college kids, Michael Bays relatives, because it was all over the place. We had robots peeing on people, Robots cussing, armed forces on motorcycles, delinquent girls who could fix cars, hackers who live with their grandmothers, jerky government types. Its one of those movies where you are yelling ""c'mon that would never happen"" and ""Are you serious?"" about 1000 times. I had a headache from rolling my eyes.

1612410,5,B00005JPNO,"It's rare when Hollywood takes a source material and turns it into something special. If you don't believe me look at the number of video games turned into films that have died painful deaths at the box office (DOOM, HOUSE OF THE DEAD, etc.). But when they do get it right, they get it right in spades.

The buildup to the release of the movie TRANSFORMERS was filled with doubt. People didn't think that the robots would be believable. They thought that director Michael Bay was too high profile and known for excess. Oddly enough I've never thought that. Instead, I've seen the films he's done in the past as pure entertainment and this film is no different.

Based on the TV cartoon series of the same name concerning a group of evil alien robots battling it out here on Earth with good ones, the film alters very little. We begin with a slam bang start as an army base is blown to pieces by one lone decepticon (the bad guys). Our heroes escape with their lives and footage of the robot to send home to Washington.

While this is going on we're given a glimpse at dork teen Sam Witwicky, whose life is not going as well as he'd planned. But his grandfather had ties to the alien robots that we learn as the film moves forward and Sam has an item that will help one side or the other aid or conquer our world. It's up to the autobots led by Optimus Prime to help.

This film is not at all about the stars which include Shia LeBouf, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson, Megan Fox, John Turturro and Jon Voight. No, the true stars of this film are the autobots and the decepticons and the technical wizards that bring them to life onscreen.

If you were made to believe a man could fly way back when SUPERMAN first hit the screen, you'll believe that your car can twist and fold into a robot after watching this movie. The effects are seamless as everything from cars to trucks to jets turn into combatant robots.

Beneath the entire effects issue though is something missing in many movies today. This movie has heart and wants to do nothing more than entertain. It doesn't want to preach or tell a political story, it wants to put good guys up against bad guys and have them win or lose. And it also offers a small amount of nostalgia for the children of the 80s who grew up with this cartoon and the toys that were made.  It succeeds on all points.

The story is quite nice, and even though some parts and characters are superfluous, it's an enjoyable film.

Shia LaBouef has fun with this role.  The whole cast seem to actually be enjoying their time, but Shia definitely rises above the source material.  Josh Duhamel also helps tone down the action movie cliches.  Although he's pretty mucha walking cliche, he helps keep a base of reality in the feature.

THe DVD set is outstanding.  A commentary from Micheal Bay and plenty of featurettes on this two disc to keep you interested, especially for hardcore fans.

But market placement does not a good movie make!!  The plot was weaker than 2% milk and the character development coulda been a Slurpee (translation: it SUCKED!!) There was plenty of action, but nothing to tie it all together and make us care.

My adolescent daughter summed up the main character's existence as a constant attempt to get lucky with the cute mechanic chick who apparently had no reason to be there at all! Why couldn't they have developed the character of the hyper-cool cyberchick who figured out the transformers were there in the first place... now THAT woulda been a more entertaining movie!!

1612585,3,B00005JPNO,"It saddens me to read reviews where people have watched this with small children and recommend it as a ""Family Film"". As the more conscientious minded reviews have already mentioned, this film is for the Teen or possibly Pre-teen. There many sexual references throughout the film. Care to explain Masturbate to a 5 year old? In our desensitized world I would have to say that the foul language was very minimal for an action film. Now let's talk about the violence. It is this reviewers opinion that this is one of the most violent film every made, provided you think about it. To the desensitized viewer they would say, ""What violence? I didn't see anyone really get hurt or killed but that poor Robot Jazz. Sniff, sniff. Do you think they can fix him mommy?"" Okay here is the kicker, in the beginning a Military Division is destroyed except for a few main characters. Does that bother anyone? Then when they discover the AllSpark they come up with a great idea, ""Let's go hide it in the city"". Duh! That's a great idea. This is when the real carnage begins. Cars are crushed, a Metro bus gets destroyed. ""There were no real people in those cars, baby. It's all done with Computers"". Buildings are smashed to pieces. A Decepticon flies through a building full of people. You can practically see all their faces in the windows. I was really expecting to see bodies fly out the other end when it came crashing out. Military Jets are destroyed and crash into the city. I must say they did a great job of excluding the deaths. So if you don't think about it, you can finish watching with your small children, thinking with a clear conscience, that you didn't expose them to any unnecessary violence. Frankly I would doubt that any pre-teen or teenager would even notice. So why do I recommend it? For your Action movie fan, this was a very entertaining movie and the Special Effects were phenomenal. My advice would be keep it out of reach of small children and above all DON'T think about it or you may become as cynical about it as I did. Otherwise Enjoy.",1199318400,,2054,4.554054054054054

1612587,5,B00005JPNO,"When it was first announced that a `Transformers' film was being made many people were skeptical, including me, regarding how good could this adaptation possibly be. The concerns were numerous, from will whoever's making it screw it up, will the robots look real, will the essence of the series remain intact, will the characters bear any resemblance to their animated counterparts, and so on and so forth. For awhile I figured the movie would simply gain a little momentum and then fade away into the depths of development heck, but when Steven Spielberg (director of ""Jurassic Park"") came on as producer, and eventually convinced action director extraordinaire Michael Bay (""The Island"" and ""Armageddon"") to come onboard to direct the film that Spielberg described as, ""The ultimate story of a boy and his car."" (The quote may be somewhat paraphrased).

""Transformers"" begins when a young teenager named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) purchases a car from a local car lot, in hopes of impressing the girl of his dreams, Mikaela (Megan Fox). Unbeknownst to Sam is that his car is not just any regular car, it is actually an Autobot named Bumblebee who was sent to Earth to find the All Spark before the evil Decepticons. However, the Decepticons, including Starscream, Barricade, and Devastator, are already on Earth, and are aware that Sam unknowingly holds the key to finding the All Spark, and are hoping to unleash their evil leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) to turn Earth into a new Cybertron. To stop the Decepticons, Bumblebee contacts his Autobot compatriots Ironhide, Ratchet, Jazz, and their leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen). Now, the Autobots and Decepticons continue their war started so long ago, but this time there is more at stake as the fate of humanity hangs in the balance.

Director Michael Bay and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg have done what some thought impossible. They managed to make a live-action `Transformers' movie that was absolutely spectacular. It boasted an excellent story that served as not only an origin story for the two warring factions, the Autobots and Decepticons, but also as a human story of survival and sacrifice. This film easily bypassed all fan expectation, after I saw the previews I thought the movie would be good, but I had no idea it would be this great. Michael Bay was by far the best choice for director of this movie, no one blows up stuff on screen as well as he does. What's also impressive about what Bay has done with ""Transformers"" is that his budget was less than that of ""Spiderman 3"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", and yet he still managed to put more visually exciting sequences on the screen than either of those films (in my opinion), and he did so using a mixture of computer generated imagery, practical effects work (an actual full-size replica of Bumblebee was built for use in some scenes), and good old' fashioned explosions that will knock your socks off.

The CGI work in this film, as crafted by George Lucas' acclaimed team at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), is absolutely some of the best I've ever seen in a feature film. ILM has created such realistic looking robots, from the use of weight and gravity (watch the fight sequence between Optimus Prime and Devastator among the streets of Los Angeles to see an example of how these two components are used), to reflections and tiny cracks and imperfections covering the robots (seen in any close-up of the Transformers), you would swear that these robots were actually real.

The actors assembled for this movie consist of a fun mixture of veterans (Jon Voight and John Turturro), rising stars (Tyrese Gibson and Shia LaBeouf), and relative newcomers (Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor). Each member of the cast did an outstanding job of keeping every aspect of the movie exciting, even when the Transformers weren't on the screen. The onscreen chemistry between Shia and Megan was a nice addition to the movie and made their blossoming romance much more endearing, and the fact that Bumblebee served as Sam's wingman was an especially sweet, and funny touch. With this movie, in conjunction with his other film in 2007 the thriller ""Disturbia"", Shia LaBeouf has proven that he easily has what it takes to carry a film, and has become one of Hollywood's hottest new stars.

Of course, all of these components together would have all been for naught without the excellent voice over work provided for each of the Transformers. It was nice to have Peter Cullen reprise his iconic role as the voice of Optimus Prime (the only actor from the animated series that returned for this movie), without his recognizable voice giving Optimus life the character just wouldn't have been the same. Hugo Weaving (`The Matrix' trilogy) was a good choice for Megatron, though his voice is not so easily recognized due to a hefty amount of digital remixing to make him sound more menacing, but he still did a good job as the evil leader of the Decepticons. The rest of the voice actors were not as recognizable, in terms of other work they'd done, but they were all equally solid in their performances, and together they made each and every one of the Transformers just as memorable as their two leaders.

In the end, ""Transformers"" is an excellent visual effects extravaganza that is extremely entertaining and features a great cast, strong story that sets the stage for even bigger things in future sequels, and some of the most impressive special effects ever seen. This is one movie that is a definite must see!

1612608,4,B00005JPNO,"This movie is a must for any Transformers fan to see, even with its many flaws. If you are a new fan I would recommend a trip into the Gen one story line to get a better background.

I was thrilled to see that a few of the beloved Gen. 1 characters were going to be dusted off and re-introduced in a live action movie. After the 1986 cartoon movie scarred most longtime fans for life (and turned me off of all the late Gen One and Gen Two story line completely) I think all of us were waiting for their redemption and some dignity for Optimus Prime.

Their new  incarnations in this movie are shocking for longtime fans, but the concept of no mass displacement does work better for a live action film. No matter what they do to him, Optimus Prime always comes out on top! There are a few nods to the longtime fans but not enough and there are characters I would have liked to have seen had their been a larger budget. The effects are  fast and incredible, even with the below par acting. There is a lot of action and you will want to watch it several times to see what you missed.

There are some really nice behind the scenes extras on how the movie was produced. It's pretty fascinating to see where they filmed, how they came up with the new character styles and how the actors had to adapt.

The things I could have done without were the ""death"" of one of the beloved Gen One characters. You barely see the battle and then comes the abrupt and out of place announcement at the end that ""he could not be saved."" It is a bit of a slap in the face. I also wouldn't miss the ""lubricating"" and hot chick references (that's just modern Hollywood for you) but most of all the twisted version of Frenzy the ridiculously hard to kill  mini Decepticon who became more and more annoying as the movie went on. Ugh!

While I do give a nod to Michael Bay and his talented special effects team, and huge praise to the men and women of the US military who helped make the film look so real (budget and mass appeal considerations aside) the film could have been better at the helm of a producer/ director who was more of a true fan and without the unnecessary Spielberg touches.

I recommend getting it but take it tongue in cheek. I'd call it just a ""frenzied"" diversion.",1199059200,,2259,4.259345794392523
1612609,4,B00005JPNO,"My expectations for action movies that rely heavily on special effects are generally pretty low.  Directors seem to think that a thin plot, sloppy dialogue, and weak acting will be compensated by mind-blowing special effects and a sound track capable of blowing your ear drums out.  ""Transformers"" does have some issues, but it is surprisingly enjoyable and a lot of fun to watch.  I was so impressed with this movie that I would like to watch it again.  I should point out that we had this movie playing on a big screen television and used a stereo for sound output, which may have affected my opinion of the movie.

Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf, ""Constantine"" and ""I, Robot"") is looking for a good used car.  He finds a slightly rough Camaro and, after a little coaxing helped along by the car, buys it.  Since we know this movie is about Transformers, which are more than meets the eye, we already know the Camaro is an Autobot.

The movie gets side-tracked for a little while to introduce Sam's love interest Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox, perhaps best known for her role as Sydney Shanowski on the television show ""Hope and Faith"").  Mikaela is anything but a shrinking violet.  She does have a certain vulnerability that occasionally shows through, but most of the time she is a take-charge kick-behind kind of girl.

Now that the two most important human characters have been established, we quickly meet the remaining Autobots, learn about the evil Decepticons, learn that Megatron is being held in cryogenic stasis after being frozen in the arctic north while looking for the All Spark, and learn that there is about to be a huge battle for the All Spark.  The Autobots want to use the All Spark to rebuild their home world.  The Decepticons want to use the All Spark to (prepare for a revelation here) conquer the universe and create more Decepticons.

Now that all that messy background stuff is out of the way, the movie gets into serious robot wars, with occasional help by humans.  The transformations between robots and vehicles are nothing less than amazing, far more complex than the simple transformations shown in previous versions, including those of the toys.  On the other hand, I could see the transformations needing to be more complex in order for the robots to be more flexible than those previously shown.

The action in this movie gets to the point where it is non-stop.  There is so much action that the movie begs to be watched again, and probably again, with slow scan a favorite and zoom if you have it.  The other feature of this movie is the soundtrack, which is explosive and nicely matches the action.  We cranked up the volume to the point where talking was difficult, but it sure was fun!

This movie is far from being perfect.  Certainly there are better action movies, but Transformers remains an original concept dating back to 1984, predating a host of other robot concepts.  I was surprised to look back and learn that the first ""Terminator"" movie was released the same year as the first Transformer toys.  Though this movie is far from being perfect (though I wonder what movie is perfect), it is incredibly entertaining.

I am willing to overlook small plot holes and annoying dialogue if the action is creative and awesome (for example, I have watched ""Independence Day"" more times than I can count).  ""Transformers"" delivers incredible creativity, spectacular effects, and enough story to hold it all together.  Grab a bowl of popcorn, turn up the volume, and just let yourself go.

Enjoy!",1199059200,5,3529,4.788429752066116
1612610,2,B00005JPNO,"Just for the record, I never really was a fan of The Transformer cartoons or  comic books, or anything like that. So, as far as this review goes, you won't be reading about any comparisons between this film and any of the other Transformers shows, comic books and films of the past. Basically, I watched this film just to watch it, and really wasn't expecting a lot. And that's exactly what I got. This film is nothing more than feel good nostalgia for those who used to enjoy the cartoons as a kid, as well as an attempt to attract a new generation of young fans. No, I guess I can't say I can blame Hollywood for doing something like this, after all, thats there job to earn a profit. But doesn't Hollywood ever think about the quality and integrity of the product they're putting out there? After watching this, apparently not. Cause I really don't know what they were doing here. The only thing that I can figure out is that they are trying to distract the audience and have them focus so much on the special effects, that they hope the audience will simply ignore the stupid storyline and horrible dialog that fills up the small gaps in-between the  action. I mean really, this is some of the stupidest plot points that I've ever seen in what is supposed to be a ""good"" film. I'm not even gonna go into detail with the overall plot, but as the film goes on, the story gets dumber and dumber. And to make things worse, some plot points are started, and totally abandoned. Again, I won't go into great details, but there is a huge part that involves finding a ""valuable"" pair of glasses, but then, the movie turns, and all of a sudden, the glasses become unimportant, and they are never mentioned again! But not only is the storyline dumb, but the attempt at humor put into this, is just horrible! Undoubtedly the dumbest thing in the whole film is the horribly painful to watch scene that involves the main character Sam trying to hide his new Robots friends from his parents! Not to mention, the crappy corny dialog between the Autobots themselves..gimme a break! Just the fact that the robots not only talk, but have facial features that includes blinking their eyes?! What tha? Do robot need to blink? Geez.. Now I know that the robots talked in the cartoons, and again, I know that this film may have been directed to a younger audience, but I just wish they would make up their mind here! They put corny crap like that in the film, but then they attempt to create a serious storyline, put in the military, secret government projects, semi-real tactical battle sequences, and even a scene that references masturbation! I mean, make up your mind guys! Is this a kids film or just a pure action film? Really, it doesn't matter which. Because this film is bad in either case! I really feel though, that this film, if done correctly, could've been pretty good. It just wasn't done serious enough. Actually write a GOOD story and they might have had something here. The main reason I'm even giving this thing 2 stars is simply because of the special effects. Despite what I think of the film, the effects were great, as well as most of the action sequences were good. Now, I think they were a bit overdone, and dominating the movie too much, but in retrospect, I would definitely rather see the Autobots and the Decepticons go at, than to listen to more crappy dialog! But the effects only proves to one thing, and that when Michael Bay does films like these (Bad Boys, The Island, etc.), its clear that he's very unbalanced. Yes, he can pull off the cool looking effects, but when it comes to an actual story and plot, he's not very good at it. And this film is no different. So if you're simply looking for huge special effects with exciting action sequences, this one is for you. However, if you're looking for absolutely anything more than that, then you're out of luck. This film should be only watched by young kids or people with low movie IQs.",1198972800,,3954,4.513249651324965

I absolutely loved this. The special effects were amazing. The characters I remembered from the cartoon seemed true to form. Optimus was super cool. Bumblebee rocked. Starscream and Megatron had some allusions to their dislike of eachother and the leadership fued from the cartoon as well.

The arrival of the Autobots for the movie was probably my second favorite part. I just wanted jump and cheer. The best parts for me were the last fight at the end. That was awesome and it was tough to keep track of everything that was happening.

The movie did an excellent job getting you into the human characters. The parts of the story revovling around the special ops team were very good. They seemed to embody all things the best American soldiers aspire to be.

The storyline was pretty good. I would liked to have scene some more about the movies only significant weak link, Sector Seven. The main character for them seemed to embody all the worst aspects of our government but aside from him it seemed like there was a lot of history there. Perhaps that was scrubbed as too reminiscent of Men In Black.

1612687,5,B00005JPNO,"Transformers surely won't win any oscars for drama or performance, but it does have one thing that blows away the compeition of 2007, and perhaps ever for that matter - complete and awesome eye candy action.  Overall, this film is far from perfect, but in the end it doesn't really matter.  You get the Transformers in unbelieveable CGI glory that could never look  better on the screen.  Its awesome and fun entertainment that still makes the movie experience very worthy.

Though based on the original series created primarily for kids, Transformers has finally hit the big screen, and with a big upgrade.  Though kids will find this fascinating, people of almost all ages will too.  There is a PG-13 rating, for a bit of language but mostly the incredible stylized action.  Like myself, you won't even have to know anything about the original Transformers to love this film, and I am already looking forward to the sequal which is already in works.

The story, as you may have already figured out, is very far from perfect.  In fact, I expected that going into the film.  I knew this was going to be pure action CGI exctiement, and I was right - except there was even more than I expected.  The cast is huge, but no huge names.  Perhaps the more familiar names in the film are Shia Labeouf, Anthony Anderson, Bernie Mac and Tyrese Gibson to name a few.  Folks like Anderson and Mac provide plenty of comedy, while Shia Labeouf steals the show as the teenage boy who buys the car that is actually a Transformer, known as Bumble Bee.  Labeouf actually does a wonderful job.  He has quite a bit of adrenaline throughout this film, and keeps up with plenty of energy that keeps the viewer engaged in between scenes with the bots.

The characters that probably steal the show the most in the end are the Transformers themselves.  They look incredibly perfect in detail on the screen.  If you are familiar with the early Transformers series, all your favorites are here - including Optimus Prime of the autobots and Megatron of the Decipticons.  When they are not in their full robotic form, the bots take the shapes of their equally beautiful cars, tankers, choppers and tanks.

The story feels big, kind of like a War of the Worlds/Armagedon feel.  The government gets heavily involved with the Pentagon and the U.S. military.  The most fascinating point of the story is how we learn that one of the bots has already been on Earth, and what the original purpose of the Hoover Dam was built for.  Other than that, you won't find anything too fascinating except the amusing connection of Ebay to all of this.

The CGI action is what it all comes down to.  The film begins with tanks beings tossed around a military base and planes blowing up.  Throughout the film, there are bits of great action scenes here and there, but the final 30 minutes is well worth it all.  This is when the bots collide in the ultimate showdown, from the Hoover Dam through the highways to L.A.  The battles go on and on, with scenes such as bots flying and fighting right through highrises, destroying everything in their path.

Number one coolest thing about this film - when the Transformers transform.  Its one thing when they do it standing still - looks great.  But most of the time, you'll find them transforming from car to robot, fighter jet to robot etc, right in the middle of battle.  Its amazing.  If you don't have a guilty pleasure for complete CGI action that looks and sounds amazing, leave this one behind.  But if you are looking for incredible entertainment that is absolute fun, get Transformers now.  Overall, its so much fun its a five star film in that sense.

1612708,3,B00005JPNO,"I loved the toys as a kid, loved the cartoon, loved the original animated movie. I was looking forward to this film. There are some things about ""Transformers"" that could have been done so much better.

What's the first flaw? The story! I wasn't too crazy about how long it took them to say ""Sam's going through puberty"". It's like ""We get it! So can we see the movie now?"" kind of thing. I understand Sam's the main human character, but they could have been a bit quicker about getting to the action - it really drags on and on for quite a while. There's also the absurdity of it all - the army handing this boy in his cotton hoodie the most important artifact discovered on the face of the planet, originally guarded by concrete so thick that the most advanced alien lifeforms couldn't find it, this is now passed like a football and they tell him ""run, boy...run"" - perhaps I'm being too critical, after all Transformers were designed for that age group anyway and it isn't exactly meant to be realistic (another thing that gets me to wondering why they went the live-action route anyway if that's the case). But it could have been handled much more gracefully.

Second flaw? The Transformers design scheme...so ""busy"". It's like when the toys went to plastic and everything started looking all pointy and cheap, consisting of nonsensically added pieces and parts with curves and things sticking out all over the place. They were alright in a way, but I really think they could have toned 'em down a bit - they looked too messy to me. And any species that takes that long to change form would surely have become extinct by now.

Third Flaw? Shia LaBeouf. Sure, he may as well continue to be Sam in the sequels at this point, but the guy needs to polish his talent up real quick. He makes Keanu Reeves look like Yul Brynner (actually I like Keanu Reeves). Mr. LaBeouf is very unconvincing at just about every line he delivers, and he can't seem to step out of his own mind to interact with the rest of the environment or the other actors. Is it the awkward years? Who knows, but it makes for one awkward experience!

Fourth and final flaw (which I'm willing to take the time to point out)? The way they tried to steal an element of every blockbuster...like one piece of each or something. It tries too hard. The stupid little robots with the ""Jar Jar Binks"" trying-to-be-cute-ness. Bumble bee's damaged voicebox rubbed me wrong in the beginning but it didn't destroy the film (like other things did). I didn't know if I was watching ""Star Wars"", ""King Kong"", ""The Matrix"" or what...as there were elements of all and more prevalent in an overly obvious fashion.

There was so much possibility with this film. It could have brought forward so much originality of its own and been a great exciting film, and it just didn't. It tried so hard to be other movies that it completely forgot that it was an incredibly original foundation to build upon. Is this Michael Bay's fault? I don't know exactly who it rests on, but he did pull the team together, right? When it was over, I couldn't help but feel that it was clear they spent far more money on this film than the entertainment value it produced was worth.

The good? The perfomances by those who played Sam's parents were nice given what they had to work with...perfect for their roles - I could see these actors being beneficial to any project they take on. The cinematography was gorgeous. Lighting was top notch. CGI had a bug or two, but looked magnificent in other regards. I can't summarize everything completely, as there is some fine work done from certain parties  - they just all didn't come together as one solid work, it seems.

I recommend renting this one, because it's worth seeing for both nostalgaic and critical purposes, but I wouldn't recommend this as a film ""to own"" nor one to put in any permanent archives as a reference to significance of anything in the realm of Hollywood history.

It's sad, but it's as honest as I can be about it - it kind of sucked. The kids might get a kick out of it, but they won't look back at it as one of their favorite childhood films, either. Really...they won't!",1198368000,,4169,4.533244680851064

1612712,4,B00005JPNO,"My gut reaction when I heard Michael Bay was going to be at the helm of the movie adaptation of Transformers I wanted to cry fearing he would butcher their legacy.  While I still have a few beefs with him, he manages to pull off a great looking film that brings a new light to the Transformer legacy.

The central characters of this pieces are really Sam and Bumblebee.  Sam is really an updated version of Spike from the cartoon series.  I like how some of these homages and continuities are kept.  Sam is something of the outsider boy who's inadequate with the girls and is also extremely excited to get a new car.  That's where Bumblebee comes in.  Robbed of a voice, Bumblebee befriends Sam.  The rest of the autobots soon assemble and the fight with the decepticons and the government ensues.

Bay uses a number of additional characters that are relatable and help move the story along.  Of note are two computer hackers who are able to latch on to what's really going on, even when the government doesn't believe them.  Jon Voigt (isn't he in everything these days) is the other major antogonizer besides the decepticons, reluctant to accept what's really going on as the decepticons are about to make their way to Earth.

The effects are dazzling in this.  I was at first scared of the ""organic"" look Michael Bay desired in the Transformers, feeling he would once again ruin my childhood.  But in reality, the transformers we grew to love in the 80s would make a weird transition to live action.  The look here is believable but spirited in the original.  What I love about the look as that their is something real looking, which has taken CGI a step further, I think.  To me, the transformers were really on screen.  I think that's also due in part to mixing in some older techniques too.  It looks sharp.

My only gripe about the film, though, is that it is aimed it kids.  It should be aimed at kids.  However, Michael Bay has a very absurd idea of humor and its role in Transformers.  There is one gag in the movie as Sam tries to hide our heroes from his parents and a comment is made that is just not appropriate in film that is marketed towards children.  futhermore, there a couple of profanities.  Remember - this movie has tons of merchandising for children and even had toys at a major fast food chain.  While it's just a bit in the movie, this movie probably could've passed for a PG or milder PG-13 without the aforementioned dialogue.  So shame on Michael Bay for that.  Otherwise, he's done an ace job, even if he sounds a little cocky on the commentary.",1198195200,,2576,4.493534482758621

For anyone who grew up in the transformers era, or had children that loved them, you couldn't help but get pulled into the energetic and fast-paced action of the film. I disagree with some of the reviews that say you cannot tell the transformers apart.  My son, who is 13 years old, knew each and every one of them as they hit the screen.  The action was unbelievable, and the story line was creative and exciting.  Add to that the years-old devotion to transformers....you get nothing but fun watching this movie.

Shia LeBeouf is terrific, and an amazing, up and coming young actor who is sure to leave a mark.

There are one or two scenes that personally I would have liked to have missed.  As a mom with a young, impressionable son, I would prefer that we eliminate discussions about ""mating"" and a constant focusing of the camera on a young girl's body.  Hollywood will eventually learn that people do indeed watch movies without all of that.

1612753,3,B00005JPNO,"The Good:
I rented this for my son, but I decided to check it out for myself (although I had extremely low expectations).  The first 1/2 of the movie is actually failry interesting (and surprisingly humerous) - like when the Upper middle class Dad who is gonna by a first car for his teenage son drives through the Porsche dealership lot just to taunt his son.  He then drives across the street to used car lot with complete with a clown and ballons. The father shows his son two cars and the son says ""this one will ensure I'll be a 40 year old virgin and this son i'll be 50 year old virgin."" The penny pinching father says to his son ""I know the camaro has racing strips, but so does that car - wouldnt you rather have a Fiesta with racing stripes.""  And when the sons pulls out of the driveway in a huge clould of engine smoke and the mother days to the father (""you're a cheap bastard""). Funny stuff.  GCI shots where a bot attacks a US Middle East base to hack into Gov computer is well done with good panoramic views.  The lead teenage actor isn't the dork I was expecting.

The not so good:
Although there are some good CGI shots, the majority of the bot effects are closeups that move at 1000 mph to the point where I got a headeach just watching it (why make 200 frames of CGI per shot when we can skimp and make only 30 and have more total CGI shots). It's shame because the spectacular detail can only be appreciated with HD in slow motion or pause mode.  This is especially true when the bot are transformering - there is litterally a 100 moving parts that fly by your eyeballs per second. Cheap bastard of a moivie producer if u ask me. I'd rather have fewer effects that one can follow.

The Craptacular:
Anyway, unlike the first half, the second half turns into the Power Ranger or Ninga Turtle cartoon I was expecting.  Well known (and miscasted)supporting actors appear and don't come close to saving 2nd 60 minutes from crap-fest stinkdom (including the guy who played Barton Fink (former Acad Award winner?) - he must be desperate for cash as he phones in mumbled lines through the most crooked mouth I have ever seen on film). The high school sweetheart side plot is so crippled by bad acting that the boy and girl both come across looking like complete tards. All the actors look lost as they somehow outrun huge 30' tall CGI bots that move at warp speed (refer to above CGI comment above).  Be amazed as our boy & girl heroes dodge extremely heavy and laser guided weapons fire from bots better armed than a battleship. I think the writers got stoned or gave up for the last 30 pages of script - a few weak dialogue lines along with "" the actors then stand around dumb founded, scream and then run away from bots"" for every scene.

Anyway, this movie was made for comic book readin' children so I give it 3 stars.  But mind you, even your kids will have sour-puss face through some of this.  Have the asperine ready.",1197849600,,2939,4.3510054844606945

It's not that I don't like the Transformers (I can hear 'more than meets meets eye' in my sleep, and even like the Orson Wells voice-over in the 1986 theatrical version) -- it's just that this is a really BAD movie.

Why?  The movie tries simultaneously to be a comedy (it flunks, except for a single funny joke about 120 minutes into this 100-minute-too-long-film), a sci-fi flick (Shatner's Kirk from Star Trek III seems like he should have won an Oscar in comparison), a coming-of-age teen movie (it makes me long for Michael J. Fox's Teen Wolf), and a traditional action flick.

Unfortunately, it tries to do so many things that its awfulness is so diluted that it's not even a good bad movie (ala Hudson Hawk, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever).",1197763200,20,866,4.554838709677419

1612782,1,B00005JPNO,"If America honestly loves this movie as much as it seems they do, then we are all screwed.

""Transformers"" is absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in years, and yet I can't count the positive reviews I read for it, or the number of people who recommended it to me--people, I might add, that I will never, ever, ever, take the advice of again.

This movie is the story of living robots who come to earth in search of a device they can't decide on a name for--sometimes they call it The Cube, sometimes the All-Spark--the screenwriters never quite worked that out.  Some of the robots are kind to humans, others want to destroy them.  They turn into cars and trucks.  They fight.  There's a bunch of inane subplots about a boy and his first car, a forced love story, lawn jokes, a girl and her felonious past, a soldier and his baby girl, a bunch of hackers, and a range of insulting stereotypes that lay the director's thoughts bare: ""Oh, you know what's really funny?  Black people!  Acting black!  That's hilarious!""  (This movie is a case study in ridiculous and demeaning stereotypes.)

The movie's director, Michael Bay, is one of the worst filmmakers working today, the man who brought us the interminable ""Pearl Harbor"" and the inexcusably sappy ""Armageddon.""  I thought even he couldn't totally ruin the potentially campy fun of a movie about giant killer robots from space, though...but he did.

This movie's dialogue is so bad, particularly the cheesy sound bites given to the robots themselves, that I would not be surprised if ninety percent of it was made up by the actors on the spot.  Seriously.  The action is more banal and unexciting than the pointless action scenes in the last two Matrix films, the story and characterizations are straight out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and the plot is almost nonexistent and completely nonsensical.  You are basically guaranteed not to care about what happens to any of the characters, and the whole thing feels absolutely eternal.  I almost turned it off more than once.

The incredibly self-conscious and expository conversations between the transformers frequently reminded me of the equally bad ""Garbage Pail Kids"" movie, which was also a misbegotten film based on '80s collectibles.  And then, get this: the robots are from the planet CYBERTRON.  Are you kidding me?  Did a nine-year-old write this?  And I don't care if it is based on the toys, you took liberties elsewhere, take the liberty to make some sense and not sound like a total moron.  Change it.

Also, several scenes are supposed to be set in the Middle East, but it could not be more obvious they were actually filmed in New Mexico, because they have freaking Shiprock in the background; I mean seriously, if you're going to use the American Southwest to double as Qatar, try not to feature one of the region's most recognizable landmarks in it.

Criticizing this movie is too easy, though.  The script--there can't be a script--is generally merely simplistic dialogue such as ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no!,"" (my thoughts exactly) or just blatant exposition.  There are sex jokes and soft adult language for the teen crowd and for all those thirty-year-old virgins stuck in their childhood, but no one ever dies or gets hurt and most of the picture seems to be catering to grade schoolers.

This is sci-fi at its worst, movies at their lowest, greed and pointlessness at their most rampant.  And it's not even entertaining, really--because I really would forgive a lot of it if it was.  It's tedious.  It's excruciatingly boring at points, almost always unbearably cheesy, never funny, never tense, and it is a total waste of what could have at least been some fun eye-candy.

I am being honest with you, when I say, this is a terrible film, very possibly the worst of the year.  Don't watch it.  Don't trust anyone that tells you it's great.  It's ""Herbie the Love Bug"" meets the Power Rangers meets Michael Bay meets a freaking TOY, and it follows a recipe that nothing good can possibly come from.",1197676800,16,4040,4.764028776978417

I LOVED, no, ADORED the Transformers as a child and, despite a couple unnoticeable inaccuracies, it kept the personalities accurate and took me back to a time where only good vs. evil mattered.

1612846,2,B00005JPNO,"My gosh this film stank.  Start to finish, the entire premise appeared to be nothing more than taking a beloved 80's childhood icon and soiling it.  Transformers - you think giant, colorful robots that make a cool transforming noise.  No, the robots are actually dingy and dirty-looking (and often seem to blend in with the backgrounds, making some of the battle sequences hard to follow visually.)  Oh, and the cool transforming noise, so iconic of the Transformers - gone (you hear it here and there in a ruined, ""new"" version.  What producer decided, ""hey, let's take the most foundational thing about transformers, the cool transforming noise, and ruin it!"")

There are far more scenes with uninteresting, 2D humans and not enough robots in discuise.  The music was terrible, and the SFX stood out as waaaaaay too CGI for my liking.
Here are some more general observations.  Potential spoilers, but you know what, if you treasured the 80's cartoon, you'd be advised to skip this turkey regardless:

The film opens with unbelievably corny helicopter dialog.  I'm sorry, people don't talk like this.  They just don't.

The car-buying sequence = stupid.  Just stupid.

The Air Force One transformer = stupid.  Sortof like a robot hybrid of ""Reptile"" from the Mortal Kombat film and ""Slimer"" from Ghostbusters.  This robot was just irritating!

One genuine laugh: the india call center during the battle sequence, complete with a nose-picking answering service.  Hilarious (that, and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, which was just awesome.  Why isn't HIS name first in the credits?  He was the only redeemable feature of this turkey?)

Bad, bad, bad cliche: ""only one man in the world who can break this code""

""A hundred times cooler than Armageddon!""  Who wrote this screenplay?  a 3-yr old primate?

Shia LaBeouf - can't even pronounce his name, and I'm not going to try to.  He's very, very unlikable in this film.

The sequence with the woman in the blue dress, just sitting there screaming, as robots and missles fly by.  Give me a break.

The conclusion of the film was a hurried mess, although Prime's send-off was classic, over-the-top cheese.

Avoid this turkey.",1197244800,3,2171,4.983240223463687

As already said this is not a forum for people to bitch about MAC's inadequate equipment. Since Mac is so great, and compatible you should be able to ""By divine intervention"" be able to download it to the MAC as a PC and easily convert it so you can watch it. All of us worthless PC/TIVO users expect it, as we have all seen the commercials stating how great the MAC is.

That being said,
My Wal-Mart free viewing of this movie after downloading it from Amazon is cheaper than I would ever be able to rent it from Blockbuster, Etc... was well worth it, and I plan on purchasing it as good as the movie was. So I guess Wal-Mart will benefit (But I'll probably get it from Target, as I have seen they have an exclusive pack with a free Optimus Prime limited edition figure....

For anyone reading this, I'm a guy born in the 70's, and my first PC was a MAC. It was awesome. They just got outclassed, and had to start over. They are doing a good job with the IPod/I phone and stuff, but the ridiculous community of MAC/Anti PC users needs to chill.

Pile on top of that the fact that this movie is about an hour longer than anything based on Transformers should ever be. The fact that they tried to create a plot, but somehow the movie is plotless still baffles me.

All in all, it's a Michael bay movie. Explosions over substance, overly tanned caricatures with zero motivations, a world basked in endless magic hour glow, and a story that makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall repeatedly.",1196985600,,642,4.672566371681416

I could spend paragraphs making the comparisons, but I guess I'll be outnumbered here anywho.

My pre-teen sons loved it and it was mostly appropriate for their age.  Even if they were teenagers, as the PG-13 rating suggests, I would still consider certain aspects of this story inappropriate for minors.  (Thank goodness for ClearPlay!!)  It boggles my mind why they make a PG-13 movie from a children's cartoon series with obvious children's toy tie-ins.

1612890,1,B00005JPNO,"Transformers were the greatest thing when I was a kid.  I still remember when my mom bought me Bumblebee.  It was the first Transformer I owned and treasured it.  I watched the cartoon religiously.

I was really looking forward to this movie, but didn't get my hopes up.  I knew Micheal Bay really didn't want to do this movie, and it looked like the plot was written around a couple of really good previews (meaning they designed a couple of slick previews to release two years ago, then wrote a movie around them).  The story and characters are annoying, uninspired, and not the least bit interesting.  I wouldn't care if the action were decent, but the shaky camera and computer graphics make it very difficult to appreciate.  It's almost impossible to tell what's going on, but it doesn't matter since you can't tell who's who anyway.  It's as if they hired a frightened six-year old girl to film some computer animated robots.  The second time I watched it I just walked away from the TV without even thinking about it.  I completely lost interest.

As far as the HD-DVD goes, it's great.  Didn't have any problems with disc.  It has a good offering of bonus features.  I just really did not like the movie.  I think it's something people will look at 10 years from now and laugh at.  Kind of like how Independence Day is laughed at now.",1196726400,10,1342,4.548117154811716

I am in my mid-30s now and I watched the Transformers cartoon series before I did my after-highschool homework. Just like G.I. Joe, thousands of bullets/lasers flew but humans ever got killed and the robots were always ""repairable"".
Some of the humor is a bit mature for yound ears. When Bill Murray asked the old lady in ""Ghostbusters"" if she had be menstrating lately, everyone in the theatre laughed and I had no clue why. I didn't understand the satire. I laughed my a** off numerous times during this film.
There was a 1980s Marvel Comic Book series based on the Transformers, so I see this as a ""comic book movie"" also...not just based on the cartoon series.
This movie delivers on all levels! When I was 13 years old, all they could have done with the transformers was to create ""movable models"" and the Transformers would have looked fake. The effects in this movie are not overblown to the extent that they hide a ""bad movie"" (see Starship Troopers). The effects are where they need to be and they only add the the FUN you will have when the Transformers come to life! 5+ STARS ALL THE WAY!

The effects are stunning and I did enjoy the characters.  The plot was a little weak in my opinion and I was hoping to see more of the transformers that got together to make the big ones like the constructacons  for example.  One thing I didn't like was that it seemed they overdid it with the 'transform' seen.  It looked awesome the first few times but to do the whole process every time they'd transform got a little tiring.

I agree with an earlier review.  The script was kind of ""meh"", in terms of plot, but at least the characters, both human and robot, were strong enough to carry the film.  The Bumblebee character was the most convincing, albeit a camaro in this movie versus the Volkswagen Bug from the cartoon series in the 80s.  The Air Force got their hey day as they advertised the C-17, A-10, F-22, AC-130 Spectre and the B-2.  Also L.A. Air Force Base and Hollowman AFB got their stab at Hollywood acting.

Better than I thought it would be.",1196553600,,694,4.375
1612982,3,B00005JPNO,"When I first heard that a live-action TF movie was being planned, I had mixed feelings about it. On the upside, I'd been wishing for such a thing since as long as I've known Transformers. On the downside, Hollywood has a notorious track record for taking great franchises and crapping all over them (Alien vs. Predator, anyone?). Near the beginning of this project, producer Don Murphy said on his message boards that he was going to watch the animated '86 movie, watch every episode of the cartoon, read every issue of the original comics, and ""do this thing right"". This made me hopeful. A few months later, I read a leaked copy of the script, and it was absolutely horrible. This, coupled with the completely botched character designs, convinced me that Don had most certainly NOT done this thing right.

Then, in early July, I worked up the courage to actually watch the movie, and I braced myself to have my childhood raped. Amazingly, the movie wasn't all that bad. The decision to choose Michael Bay as director proved to be an extremely wise one. He REALLY knows how to put something on film, he knows how do make CGI look photo-realistic, he made dozens of improvements to the script, and he cast Shia Labeouf, whose improv skills made the dialogue even funnier and wittier. The movie ended up with a pretty good balance of drama, romance, action, acting, filmography, and special effects. However, I was still annoyed that the names of the human characters were changed, that the designs of the Transformer characters got completely screwed up (as well as the choice of characters themselves), that the almighty Megatron was killed by a HUMAN TEENAGER of all things, and that the plot in general (protoforms, the Cube, etc.) had virtually no grounding in the source material. I could also go on about how the transformations were too complex, how too much time was spent on the human characters and not enough on the Transformer characters, why the police car should have been an Autobot named Prowl instead of a Decepticon named Barricade, blah blah blah... but for a person who doesn't care much about adherence to the source material (or to the laws of physics) and knows how to see the redeeming qualities in a movie, this is definitely worth watching. Although I'm definitely one of the latter, I'm generally not one of the former. That's why I give this movie 3 stars.",1196553600,,2384,4.758454106280193

Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out.

Now, back on topic, this movie was awesome, suprizingly good plot, exciting action scenes, and beyond realistic special effects, anything an action movie fan would want. Some fans of the show might not like the lack of Autobot interaction for the first hour of the movie, but I kinda liked it, it built-up the mystery of it, and the decpeticons scared the living crap out of me. The score for this movie was phenominal for an action film and I'm itching to buy it.

The Storyline is well written, the actors fit into their roles perfectly, the effects are great and I give it a 10.
Transformers is one of those movies that only come out every few years. The movies captivate a worldwide audience and bring forth a legion of fans worldwide. I love how the Autobots represent good by transforming into cars and the decepticons who represent evil transform into weapons of war.
I was a fan of the transformers Beast Wars in the 90's so this was a great movie due to the fact that I already knew some of the Characters.

Of course thing change and technology gets better or different from what we predicted back then (just look at fasion eh?). So I thought it was a brilliant movie brought to life that not only made you empathise not only with the human characters but also with the robot/cgi characters.

I was over at my stepson's for Thanksgiving and he put Transformers into the DVD player and was so excited about it being a great movie.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of it.  By the end of the movie I became convinced that the writers' strike must have been before the movie was made.  This had to be one of the worse movies I have ever watched.  I wouldn't have sat through the whole movie, but I wanted to be polite.

1613075,4,B00005JPNO,"I was urged by some friends to get and watch this movie,knowing full well my first reaction was going to be to turn my nose up at it. And they were right. Every instinct in my being told me no.....no way on earth. After all this was just going to be another shameless marketing ploy by the toy company to exploit their product on the big screen. They had already done it once before(animated) and on TV and have sold gazillions of toys,comic books and other related paraphenalia. This is kids stuff,why in the world would I want to see let alone review such a thing?
Well fresh after watching this movie I am still trying to catch my breath. I feel like I have just come off the biggest and baddest rollercoaster ride of my life. What a rush!!
The movie starts off deceptively normal. Our protagonist is a young nerdy type kid whose said nerdiness is reinforced after we watch him give an oral report on his grandfather. Later his father takes hims to buy him his first car. He settles on a junker of an old camaro but wait....maybe the car is settling on him(?),almost ""Christine""-like. The car the salesman wants to pawn off on him is almost wrecked by the car the boy wants! But the movie doesn't stop to examine or ponder anything. On we go.
The next scene is a Socsan base in present day Qatar. The military escorts a helicopter(bogie)onto their base but all hell breaks loose when it transforms into a robot hell bent on the bases' destruction and downloading vital classified material.
And from here the movie doesn't let up its' pace. Everything is played straight down the line including the military which is played like something out of ""Black Hawk Down"",very realistically and very deadly. Many plot devices are cleverly employed throughout this film to keep either us or the on screen characters in the dark until the proper moments. It moves on many levels and indeed works brilliantly throughout.
Like the movie the wonderful cast also plays everything straight. This along with the spectacular special effects creates a you-are-there and a this-is-very-real feeling throughout. And as I mentioned before there are no apologies or stops to catch your breath any time in this film. It's a ""if you didn't catch that kid...tough"",kind of attitude. For example the smaller Decepticons are often seen talking and we are first given sub-titles(in hard to read white...purposely,I think!) in their language then a quick translation into English. But as they come up so fast and only periodically,your eyes aren't usually watching for them. By the time you try to catch them they are long gone. All part of the frenetic pace this film establishes and goes with right to the last frame.
I watched the single disc version of this film so the only extras are a couple of trailers and that's it. For anyone wanting more I suggest you buy the double disc edition. Whatever edition you buy though the main attraction is the heart stopping,high adrenaline,no apologies thrill ride that will keep you glued to that screen from the first frame to the last.
An amazing job done by all involved.

In fact I could only stomach 32 minutes of it before I threw the DVD, the case and the little card inside the case away.

Basically for some odd reason the director, or writers, decided to create a role reversal twist in which the male lead acts like a girl, and female lead is the man.

I could actually hold down my lunch for the girl's part, but the male lead was sickening.  I remember my 6-year-old sister screaming like that when she saw spiders.

There was an excellent build up to the awesome city battle. The score was absolutely mesmorizing.
The CGI was top notch and the look of the Autobots and Decepticons were terrific. There were changes from anime lore to make the movie but it was well executed.
They could have added more to the plot and I would like to have more to show how vast their war across the universe it.
Still this is an excellent movie with a positive message about people.
It is respectful to our military too.
My only small complaint was the ending. I would have preferred Megatron fall by Optimus' hand rather a human.

I ended up missing it in the theatres.  I decided to watch the DVD after seeing some of the documentary on how the movie was made; it peaked my interest.

I am glad I did.  This was a fun action film that I enjoyed from the beginning until the end.  The special effects were great and while the plot was never deep, it held my interest.

My only complaint was that the movement of the transformers was too fast.  While watching a special on the animation of the transformers, the director (I believe) mentioned that the average transformer toy had less than 50 movements it could make.  The animated transformaers had over 10,000!  I was hoping to be able to see much of that detail, but unfortunately the tranformers were always moving so fast that much of that detail was lost.

Why bother putting down a movie that was well made and most people like. If you like complaining, and criticizing things, then criticize yourself, because you need help.

Now as for the movie. I loved the movie! It was very well-made and entertaining. Such high standards are held for movies now, but remember that movies are simply stories told to entertain. If a movie entertains its viewers, then it has succeeded in its purpose. Transformers was very detailed; the computer animation was the best I've ever seen in any movie; the plot was intricate; the acting was great; it was very funny; and it held my attention. I thought it was the best movie since 300.

If you're a parent, you should consider carefully whether you want your child to see this movie. My wife and I thought the PG-13 rating was for the violence, but it's not. It's for the ""crude sexual humor"", most of which was fine but one part was wildly out of place. Be prepared to discuss what ""Sam's happy time"" is with your child. Since this is a movie based on a cartoon directed at CHILDREN it was wildly inappropriate and completely out of place with the movie. My wife and I were both stunned. We're not prudes and unlike many parents we let our daughter watch ""scary"" movies (Star Wars) or movies with a tad bit of tastefully done sex (SeaBiscuit) at far younger ages than many.

Dialect - This is the worst part of the movie.  It's sufficient for a 10yr old, anyone have a high school education would cosider it childish.
In-Movie advertisements - It's alright to do advertising in the movie, but don't do it so bluntly and repeatedly.
The awesome fights - Well, it wasn't really so awesome to be honest.  It was just a messy graphics of 2 or 3 robots tangled together.  You really weren't able to see what or how the fight was going.

Fortunately I watched it on a DVD, was able to fast foward majority of the movie and shorten 2 1/2 hours to about 1 hour.  It was a bit of too much fast forwarding, but 1 1/2 hour should have been the length, there was just too much junk material stuck in.",1195344000,18,937,4.470588235294118

Plus it was a delight to hear the original voices on there.

The movie just gave me friendly goose bumps taking me back to those good times for Saturday morning cartoon hours.  The movie was very nicely balanced between Bay and the fan's vision. What i respect mostly (once u c the special features disc) about Bay was his interactive adjustment to the film creation process. He took it seriously from a historical point and took the time to listen to the nasty comments and criticism of hard core fans of the series.

But probably the biggest flaw the film has is that the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons is fundamentally uninteresting.

Michael Bay tries hard to derail the movie with talk of ""happy time"" and some really dumb supporting characters, but despite his efforts, the movie still manages to entertain.  The HD-DVD exhibits the same high-contrast style of the film, with sepia- and bronze-saturated colors that are so vogue in Hollywood right now.  (One can understand why '300' would benefit from this style, but it's a little puzzling for a movie like Transformers.)  HD-DVD consumers like their detail in their image, and lots of it, but the high contrast does mean that some of the detail is lost in darker areas of the screen.  In those areas that ARE lit, there's still plenty to look at on the human and robotic characters; there's an abundance of skin sheen, hair, fabric, and nice detail on all the elements that make up cars, tanks, planes, and trucks.  Some owners of this disc have complained that the audio (specifically the LFE / subwoofer channel) isn't as robust as it should sound, especially during the ""pulse blast"" attack toward the beginning ... and indeed that particular moment ought to attack the sub but doesn't.  Nevertheless there were hearty earth-shaking moments during the climactic final battle, which makes me wonder about whether there might have been a mix-up in the audio mix for the HD-DVD.

The special effects are the real star of this movie, and manage to look flawless even in high definition.  That right there is reason enough for most sci-fi geeks (like me) to own the disc, and gives you some great material to show off in the home theater.

From the version in the 80s to this: the transformation continues. Thankfully the makers didn't retro it in any way: each generation of moviemaker should create their own version and they have succeeded immensely in my opinion.",1195084800,,380,4.7727272727272725
1613199,5,B00005JPNO,"I have only vague recollections of the original Transformers series, more remembering the toys through the alcohol induced haze that is my memory of the 1980's. However, despite this bio-alcoholic setback, the trailers for this movie had me salivating to see this film.

The movie ""The Transformers"" contains a relatively homogenous story that stands alone as a story in its own right. It follows the arrival of the Autobots on Earth in search of the All Spark. They arrive at about the same time as the Decepticons, who are also searching for it. There are three groups of people the movie connects with in their own dealings with various aspects of Autobot and Decepticon activity as the war over the All Spark spills out onto the streets of U.S. city.

The first drawcard for this movie is the exceptional special effects. Without a doubt, some of the best that I have seen, and they certainly were rendered with the real scenery well. The complexity of the graphics during transformations was impressive, and worked well. The movie definitely presents a hell of a lot of eye-candy and is a visual spectacle.

In addition, the robots themselves were not your average, wooden, ""Robocop"" type of automaton. They expressed real emotions and carried a charged vibe that was quite authentic. This is especially true of the character Bumblebee. Although not necessary, it added credibility and relatability to the characters.

The people who acted in the movie put in sterling performances, Shia LeBeouf included as Sam Whitwicky. Other big names include Jon Voight, John Turturro, and Bernie Mac.

The two-disc package is good value for money. Unlike some ""sepcial features"" discs, this one is well-organised, very informative and is not just a load of footage of people sitting around discussing scripts. They all focus on different aspects of the movie and its plot, and include a lot of interviews with key players in the making of it. I really enjoyed these special features much more than usual.

For fans of a good action film with some real storyline to it, with a science fiction leaning, this is a hard movie to beat. I really enjoyed it and have seen it a lot. I am still not bored with it. Each viewing reveals a few details unnoticed on previous viewings. This is a great movie and package overall.",1195084800,,2308,4.860050890585241

1613229,5,B00005JPNO,"Let me begin by stating that until this film I had never seen anything related to Transformers. I'd never watched the old Animated series, nor read the comics or played with one of the toys.
When this film's production was announced, I shrugged, saying to myself 'Its a toy movie, how good can they possibly make a toy movie?' and decided I was not going to watch this movie in theaters.
As the posters came out, followed by the trailers, I ignored them completely, convinced that this movie would be completely worthless, and I was going to take no part in it.

A week or so after it opened, one of my friends called me up stating that he was rounding up a few of our mutual friends to go see Transformers. It was the middle of the summer, I'd been working 30 something hour weeks and I hadn't had much time to see anyone, so I agreed, figuring that at least I'd get to hang out with some people.

We headed over the the movie theater, I reluctantly paid for the movie ticket, and sat outside the theater waiting to be admitted.
Of the six of us, all but two thought exactly as I did, that this movie was probably going to be a waste.
We got our seats, sat and talked, watched the trailers, and the movie began.

It opened with the All Spark floating through space, and Peter Cullen's superb voice narrating.
By the time the attack in Qatar sequence had finished, I turned to my best friend who was sitting next to me and said ""You know, I seriously underestimated this movie."" He nodded, and we both turned back to the screen.

In short, this movie blew my socks off.
The Autobots and Decepticons look superb, and the fight sequences, while occasionally hard to follow due to the mass of the robots themselves, are just amazing. The music hits you just as much as the look of the Transformers do, completing the effect of pure movie magic.

The storyline, the most important piece of any film in my opinion, is action packed and driven, taking you from Qatar to the Pentagon to the Hoover Dam, and leaving you with an ending that just screams for a sequel.

This is one movie that has not been over hyped, it is well worth the time and the money, and the only wish I would have in regard to this film is that I had gone to seen it earlier in theaters, and multiple times.",1194912000,,2273,4.323943661971831

1613250,4,B00005JPNO,"Based upon a cartoon of the same name that was produced between 1984 and 1987, the 2007 live-action film ""Transformers"" used some very impressive special effects to bring two battling sets of robot aliens to life.  The robot aliens, from a destroyed planet called Cybertron, are more commonly known as Transformers due to their ability to transform from a robot into a motorized vehicle of some kind.  The good robots, lead by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) and called ""Autobots"", are searching for a powerful object that can bring machines to life.  The evil robots, lead by Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) and called ""Decepticons"", also want the object for obvious evil purposes.  Why do battle on Earth?  Because the object that both sides want is there.  Whereas the Autobots respect human life, humanity means nothing to the Decepticons, as demonstrated during the opening scenes of the film in which a U.S. Army base is attacked.  With only a few surviving soldiers, including Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the military, under Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight), seeks to determine what the attacker wanted; but so does a secret government organization.  In the meantime, a teenager named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), desperately wants a car so that he can get a girl named Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox).  He gets his car (a yellow sports car), which, as you can probably guess, is not just an ordinary car.

Under the direction of Michael Bay (best known for directing ""Armageddon"" in 1998 and ""Pearl Harbor"" in 2001), who is no stranger to special effects, the film's story moves slowly with a lot of teenage angst at the beginning, but picks up pace later.  Littered with explosions, daring feats, robot battles and fleeing innocent bystanders, the special effects take center stage more than the actual actors.  While this often weakens a film's plot, in ""Transformers"", the battles are central to the film's story since the robots are at war with one another.  As for the human characters, except for the teenage angst, they were adequately developed to carry their part in the film (though Sam's parents, played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White, were not particularly interesting). As for the robot characters, their personalities were simple & easy to develop: good & compassionate, or evil and uncaring.  Overall, ""Transformers"" is an entertaining film and earns a rating 4 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters (human) in the film include Maggie Madsen (Rachel Taylor), Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson) and Agent Simmons (John Turturro).",1194825600,,2571,5.0736342042755345
1613251,3,B00005JPNO,"I was originally going to skip this movie due to my utter disdain for Michael Bay and his paper-thin characters and over-the-top bombast. But I caved and went to see Transformers on opening weekend. It's safe to say that this was a project right up Bay's alley. After all, who was expecting riveting character development from a source material about alien robots who kick each other's butts? This project was destined to be a full-on spectacle and little else, which is why Bay is a perfect fit.

Young teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) buys his first car only to discover that is actually a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee and discovers his family ties to a government secret a hundred years old and an alien war thousands of years older. In the process, he manages to woo hottie Mikaela (Megan Fox, who must also be from another planet just because of how hot she is) and help the good guy Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) retrieve the coveted Allspark and defeat the evil Decepticons, whom are led by Megatron (voiced by Agent Smith himself, Hugo Weaving). Meanwhile, a group of nameless Marines consisting of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson aid in the battle against the Decepticons but add little else to the actual story and your typical, cliched ""goverment agency so secret that the rest of the government doesn't know it exists"" shows up, led by an apparently overacting John Tuturro. John Voight makes yet another appearance as a government suit, and comedian Bernie Mac and comedic actor Anthony Anderson appear to add your typical, cliched comic relief.

The story seems basic aside from the occasional Transformers geek-speak and the ""boy and his robot"" vibe between Sam and Bumblebee smacks of Speilberg's touch (Speilberg is the producer), but there are plenty of characters here that are either cliches, add nothing to the story, or both. But the story isn't what makes this movie worth watching. No Michael Bay movie is worth watching for its story. After all, this is the guy who made the Pearl Harbor bombing into a Titanic-ripoff love story instead of using an actual story from the event's victims and survivors. So don't expect anything near Shakespeare here. The only real reason to watch this movie is for the fantastic special effects. So turn off your brain and enjoy.",1194825600,,2318,4.851010101010101

Joe, Thunder Cats, and of course the Transformers. In 2007, Dreamworks studio released the long awaited full length version Transformers directed by Michael Bay. Children and young adults rejoiced as they finally saw their childhood heroes come to life on the silver screen.
 I wasn't sure what to expect from the film. The idea of Aliens from outer space that take form of automobiles seems a little silly to me, but Hollywood pulled it off as usual. The special effects were outstanding. Almost every scene was action packed. The main character Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LeBeof is a very lovably character. He is kind of goofy and nerdy, but soon finds himself smack dab in the center of a fight to save Earth. The script was not very well written, but the special effects and action scenes make up for it. Many people will probably criticize the movie for lack of direction and plot. But honestly guys? It's Transformers, not Schindler's List. The reason that this movie was made was for people to enjoy the visual effects and sense of adventure. Two qualities that I believe were wonderfully displayed.
 The Transformers dialogue was somewhat cheesy at times, but I believe that they tried to script the movie like the cartoon. If you go back and watch the episodes now, you will here the same kind of corny dialogue. I think it's better to be authentic than completely change the feel of the characters. The film is targeted at tweens through young adults. Some parts seem a little to violent for young children, but it wasn't excessive. There were also some sexual innuendos that may be inappropriate for younger viewers at times.

1613283,2,B00005JPNO,"Growing up in the 80s, I saw the 1986 Transformers movie in the theaters and recently watched it again, and even though I'm in my late 20s now, the movie holds up remarkably well:  it has a good pace, great balance of storylines, well-defined characters, and plenty of action that builds towards a monstrous battle that includes a genuine surprise.

Unfortunately, the Transformers 2007 movie lacks almost all of that.  Credit Shia Lebeouf for his role in this movie, because he carries the entire overwrought monster for a good two hours or so, and his ability to do both comedy and drama in a single movie is impressive.  And there are many more people here that turn in solid performances, including Megan Fox, his female costar.  Beyond that, though, we get a smattering of comedy here and there along with maneuvering, slow reveals, and more buildup, and more, and more until, almost two hours into the movie, we finally see most of the Decepticons, and there is finally a real battle ... which lasts for about 15 minutes.

This movie is big ... very big ... and the final battle has a lot of action (though Bay's direction insures that it's nearly impossible to tell what's going on a lot of the time).  Coupled with some very sophomoric humor, the audience here is clear:  it's young adolescents, fresh out of being tweens, who still want good action and jokes but crave a bigger storyline and higher stakes.

THE GOOD:  Some of the jokes work, and work well.  Shia and Megan do a great job in their roles.  Seeing Optimus Prime, Jazz, Starscream, and a few other familiar faces gave this Transformers fan a warm feeling.

THE BAD:  You see Autobots play glorified hide and seek with Shia's parents, a dog pee on a robot, a robot pee on a person, John Turturro stripped down to an undershirt and boxers, enormous plotholes involving the All-Spark, no Dinobots, no real use of Starscream, a completely anticlimactic battle between Optimus and Megatron that ends in an enormously stupid way, two long hours of build-up for one confusing battle, and to top it all off, Anthony Anderson.

Shia LaBeouf channels Micheal J Fox from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Back-to-the-Future-Trilogy/dp/B00006AL1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Back to the Future Trilogy</a>, down to having an absurd car. But rather than have any kind of intricate plot, we have a war with alien robots that happens to have found its way to earth.

It's up to Shia and girlpal Megan Fox (who looks WAY too old to be in high school) to help the Autobots beat the Decepticons, along with a special ops force from Iraq. There's the plot...and it is stretched mindlessly over 2 1/2 hours of stunning fight scenes, wanton destruction and explosions, really cool transformation scenes and surprising political satire. But really, this is a popcorn time waster in the best sense of the word. There are plot gaffes galore (I could not fathom why Bumblebee, who could transform himself to any item at will, could not fix his voice just by transforming it) to be ignored and some really tough belief suspenders (like Shia running block after block with Megatron just barely able to NOT catch him). But if you don't mind that fact this Saturday Morning Cartoon of a plot that could have been trimmed to 60 minutes exists solely to entertain anyone with a penchant for big LOUD BAANNNNGGGINGGG movies, then ""Transformers"" will entertain you.

I thought the product placement was rampant and distracting, the romantic relationship was cringe worthy, and the whole plot was overstuffed with chinzty stressors and visual excitement.

Product placement comes first.  I don't have any problem with subtle product placement that does not dominate the script.  For example, if the protagonist is going to be using his computer often then why not approach Dell to see if they'd like their brand name on the monitor?  As my wife and I deconstructed this movie last night in bed, we found a lot of useless scenes that only seemed to exist to provide an opportunity for product placement.  Somebody eats a whole plate of donuts in a situation where they you wouldn't expect donuts, we're given 15 seconds of explanation as to why the donuts are there, and then shortly after the character has prominently consumed some Pepto-Bismal.  Did the analyst have to sneak the data out of the Pentagon for the soul purpose of placing emphasis on a Panasonic SD card?  Is the protagonist wheeling and dealing just to explain the plot's emphasis on Ebay?  Never mind GM's sponsorship of the movie.

I could only just barely stand the romantic relationship.  For starters, the female lead was entirely oversexed, especially for a high schooler.  Some time was wasted in the beginning of the movie with Bumblebee playing Herbie the Love Bug incognito.  The sexual tension was ratcheted up a bit when the male lead got the female lead to sit on his lap ""for safety's sake""; the back had no seat belts and she refused to sit in the driver's seat while the car was driving itself.  Then one of the autobots identified that the boy wanted to ""mate with the girl"".  The barometer just keeps on rising with nary an innocent kiss, until, at the conclusion of the movie, the two appear to be priming themselves to 'continue the circle of life' atop their new best friend, Bumblebee, while the Autobots and the men in black watch on.

Finally there was all the overdone stress and excitement that, for some reason, Bay felt necessary to achieve his golden 143 minute run time.  Why did the female lead order the secret cop to strip?  Apparently just to reveal his funny underwear.  Why did the male lead take his 'do anything' badge?  Beats me.  Generally in a movie when you make a big deal about acquiring a cop's badge and clothes you use them to advance the plot.  I guess including a hilariously obnoxious obese black computer genius is comedy gold in Hollywood, but mightn't we expect him to be worked into the plot?  And the fights had just too many cuts, zooms, and jiggles.  I suspect that this is because, once the studios had constructed their CGI monstrosities, nobody could figure out how to make them fight excitingly.  The answer of course was to zoom, cut, and 'hand cam' like mad.  That added plenty of visual excitement, but it made the fights pretty hard to follow.

In conclusion, the best part of this movie was Tom Lenk.",1194566400,13,3084,4.684014869888476
1613318,5,B00005JPNO,"Transformers, one of the year's biggest blockbusters , arrives on DVD on Tuesday and here at Mania.com we have you covered with a look at the two-disc special edition. Now working under the assumption that most visitors to the site have already seen the film I'll spend an equal amount of time on the movie itself and the DVD extras.

The basic plot finds both Autobots and Decepticons on Earth, searching for the Allspark, the cube that can essentially bring mechanical objects to life and a source of great power. The Allspark had found its way to Earth and Megatron sought to claim it but crashed his ship in the arctic and was frozen in ice. He was found by explorer Captain Witwicky in the late 1800's and the captains glasses were imprinted with the location of the Allspark. Several Decepticons (Starscream, Barricade, Frenzy, Blackout, Devastator, Bonecrusher, and Scorponok) have come in search of the cube. Blackout attacks a U.S. Military base in Qatar to hack into the military's computer system. Captain Witwicky's descendent Sam has just bought his first car, a rusted out '76 Camaro that turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee. He summons the Autobots (Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet) to help protect Sam and find the Allspark before the Decepticons due. Now as I hate playing spoiler, even if you have seen it, that's the plot in a nutshell.

The two performances that standout for me are Shia LaBeouf as Sam and John Tuturro as Govt. agent Simmons. LaBeouf brings a perfect blend of innocence, vulnerability, and humor to his role. He's one of those average kids who is not a member of the ""in crowd"" but who finds himself at the center of the battle between the Decepticons and Autobots. He's natural and believable. Turturro is just a treat to watch chewing up scenery as the arrogant agent Simmons. He helps add a good does of humor to the film as well. Megan Fox's role as Mikaela Barnes was the one that left me flat. She seemed to be there only as eye candy (which she does very well). It's even mentioned in one of the documentaries that they were looking for the hottest 18 year-old they could find and apparently, talent was a distant second on the list.

A lot of fans were outraged when they saw their first look at the pictures before the film was released. They were upset that the Transformers didn't look like the Transformers they knew from the TV show or the toys. I was not one of those, however. Characters from comic books or animated shows NEVER look the same in feature films. It's a given we have to accept. What looks good in a comic simply doesn't translate well to live action. It's why the X-Men didn't wear their usual costumes in the films. That colorful spandex may look good on paper but in film it looks...garish. The CGI was incredible. I liked the quick, smooth transformations of the robots and their fluidity of movement.

The robots, especially the Decepticons don't get much in the way of character development. We don't even see Megatron until a good two-thirds of the way through the film and Starscream gets only a couple of lines. I can't fault Director Michael Bay too much, however. Between all the human characters and a dozen or so Transformers, that's a lot of characters to try and develop. The one big problem with the look of the robots was that outside of Optimus and Bumblebee, most of the rest had indiscernible color schemes and it became hard to tell them apart when they were battling each other. And what happened to Starscream? I watched it a few times and still can't figure it out. One moment he's fighting Air Force jets and the then poof gone!

The extras on the two-disc set run a little over two hours total, not including the commentary track with Michael Bay. ""Their War"" (65 minutes) is an in-dept look at the Transformers themselves with comments from Bay, Steven Spielberg, and cast and crew. You'll see how the Transformers were brought to life. Bay even jokes about the angry comments he got from Transformers fans early on but admits he took the comments to heart and made several changes the fans suggested. Bay explains why Peter Cullen, the longtime voice of Optimus Prime was kept but Frank Welker, the voice of Megatron was not (It does make sense when you see how Bay explains it) He instead used Matrix and Lord of the Rings star Hugo Weaving for the top baddie. You'll get to see how many of the film's stunts and special effects were done, including how they cut the moving bus in half during the freeway battle...and there was NO CGI used! This was an outstanding documentary. I actually watched it before the film and it alleviated many of the apprehensions I had.

""Our World"" (48 minutes) takes a look at all of the actors in the film and how they were cast. Josh Duhamel and the rest of the actors playing military roles went through several days of basic training in the desert to prepare for their parts including the firing of weapons and flying jets. Bay got full cooperation with the U.S. military including use of airbases and weapons, not to mention several soldiers in extras roles. They were very CAREFUL to mention that the producers compensated the military for their time and equipment...lest some liberal legislator starts screaming about wasting tax dollars.

""More than meets the Eye"" is a short feature (about 10 minutes) on the making of the Desert Battle scene against Scorponok. You'll see this scene develop from storyboard, to computer animatics, to the final film version. One bit of trivia from this feature is that the soldier who is impaled by Scorponok's tail is played by Zack Ward. Ward is best known for his role as bully Scut Farkas in the holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"".

The extras are very good but a little light considering what a blockbuster this film was. I would expect that in six months time or so we'll be seeing a special Director's Cut with even more bonus material.

1613319,5,B00005JPNO,"My son saw this movie at the theaters and could not stop talking about it. So for halloween instead of tons of candy,we bought the DVD for him- he is enjoying it immensely.",1194480000,,172,4.242424242424242
1613320,5,B00005JPNO,"I loved the movie since I knew they were making it, I loved it more, when I found out it was Michael Bay, and I really loved it when I saw it. So Movie awesome, the behind the scenes and making the movie, great. Awesome product!",1194480000,,228,3.9782608695652173
1613321,5,B00005JPNO,"First off I would like to say that yes, I am a Transformer fanboy. I grew up on the TV shows and the toys and I still love them. So I knew at some level I would love this movie even though I had some low executions of it. Some movies suck but have 2 or 3 cool sequences that are pretty cool so it makes the movie overall acceptable. That what I thought would happen here. Boy was I was wrong.

Here are some things that made this move great:

* Shia LeBeouf - I have liked Shia in his other movies like Holes and Greatest Game... but I think this was the break out performance of his career. He was funny, energetic, and just totally likable. I think he was perfect for this part and I enjoyed watching him in this film. I think his career as an actor will really take off.

* Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime - This small detail to me was what made this movie really about transformers and not just some generic robot movie (which it easily could have been). It helps link it back to the past of what transformers really is.

* The Movie did not take itself to seriously. It was funny, it poked fun at itself and at the transformers franchise. It kept things pretty light through the action. I thought the Indian operator was very funny and a nice touch.

* The autobots characters were true enough to the originals to make them more believable. I felt that the autobots exhibited similar personalities as they did in the TV show. The Decipticons were really hardly in the movie so it is hard to gage their characters, but when Megatron tells Starscream ""You failed him yet again"" I about fell out of my chair. That was great.

* It had a good mix of action and character building. How the action in Quatar are broken up by building up the Sam character. The shots where Sam is trying so hard to impress Mikaela are great as well as Sam connecting with Bumblebee.

* The animation of the robots was well done, I never felt like ""Oh that was so CG"", it felt seamless. They did a great job animating the transforming (I never got tired of it) as well as the robot's face animations. They really seem to give to robots personality and a character.

I agree that this movie did have some glaring flaws (""lets take the Cube to the big city where it will be safe"" A shameless setup for the action sequence) but I felt that the good parts, the Awesome parts, easily overshadowed the flaws. So I am willing to forgive the imperfections since the movie as a whole ROCKED.

This movie did exactly what it was intended to do. And that was give props to transformers franchise while being an entertaining experience that fans and non fans can enjoy.

There are lots of other things I can say about it, but what made this movie special to me was the fact that I sat thorough the 2.5 hours with a big smile on my face and walked away from it feeling that my ticket was money well spent.",1194480000,2,2883,4.244525547445256
1613322,2,B00005JPNO,"The F/X in this movie are outstanding and the action sequences in the desert are fun to wtach, but typical of a Michael Bay film, the whole movie falls apart around the 1/2 way point when the story turn from simple but fun to dumb and boring.

What a waste of a visual appealing movie.

On a plus side, the DVD quality is excellent.",1194393600,6,332,4.171875
1613323,5,B00005JPNO,"i was at first unsure of this film as i thought to myself, ""another stereotypical teenage boy movie this is gonna be"".

but boy was i wrong. i saw it at the movies and i can't get enough of it. this film is action packed and exhilirating. and of course, there's humor to it as well (w/alien autobots from another planet, it's kinda hard not to). even though i was not a fan of the original transformers back in the 80s (i was not born in the 80s), this movie has caught my attention. the characters are so energetic and fun to watch (bumblebee's simply adorable...and yes sensitive even though he's not human) and even the music suits the scenes extremely well (thanks the great works of steve jablonsky).

so get ready for an exciting roller coaster nonstop action ride, you'll enjoy it. definitely not somethin only preteens like and even though it's not an oscar winning film, it sure will keep your heart pumping!

HIGHLY recommended",1194393600,,937,4.598802395209581
1613324,5,B00005JPNO,"The extras are amazing and if you invested in a full HD 1080p TV you owe it to yourself to pick up this great little treat. The full screen 1080p hddvd package brings you two discs jam packed with transformer goodness. I found a used HDDVD drive for my 360 and was able to get one for 140.00 So get one don't be cheap and grab one if you own a nice TV an Xbox360. If you missed this in theatres and you know who you are, or if you just want a movie to justify your TV purchase this is the movie to do both. Hope this helps,

1613325,1,B00005JPNO,"I'm not going to say ""I'm a huge fan"" or ""I'm a child of the 80s"" because all that is irrelevant. A bad film is a bad film, straight up! Why does a Transformers film need stupid teenagers who wear band shirts running around trying to get laid? WHY? What does it add to the story, other than crude jokes and an excuse to tilt up and down some hot chick's midriff? How about NOTHING! This film should have just been Transformers and the military, that's what we want to see, not bodily fluids being unleashed and cheap sex references so MTV-martyrs can get a laugh! Why all the GM advertising? Are the kids who are going to bug their parents to buy them all the toys going to buy cars after the movie ends, too? Good lord! So Megatron can survive deep space, which is more frigid than we can imagine, but he can't sustain himself in a glacier? Wow Bay, you are so talented! Ever notice a similar theme in every Michael Bay film, that of a Caucasian loser (except the Bad Boys films) trying so hard to score with a few action sequences thrown in? I'm officially boycotting any film with his name attached to it for life. I had my doubts about this, and sure as heck, they manifested before my eyes!",1194393600,17,1195,4.292035398230088
1613326,5,B00005JPNO,"Amazing movie. I am a long time Transformers fan. You would not believe how many of these toys I got for christmas (and during the year). This movie brough back so many memories and it made them even better! The movie is exciting and funny. The movie was too short for me even though it was about 2 & 1/2 hours long. Some of the characters look a little different, but they are also very much the same in personality. My only problem with the film is that some of the scenes are a little scattered with the big bulky transformers moving around so fast during the action; but then again I was watching it on the IMAX I had a lot to try and compress into my sight. I bought this on DVD and it is just as exciting as it was on film. I highly recommend you ad this to your DVD library and enjoy it for as many times as you can.

1613328,3,B00005JPNO,"I rented this movie because of a friend's recommendation. Although I guessed by the title how silly it is, the movie was better than I thought it would be. It was just mind numbing. They didn't even try to make the scientists sound plausible, they just strung phrases together like quantum mechanics and fourier transforms. However, the romance was good. The relationship between the man and his car or protector was interesting. Some of the sight gags were good. The acting was good. The actors took their parts seriously. The plot was silly, but it sort of worked because of the acting.

In summary, if you don't mind having a few brain cells die during the watching of this film, there are far worse films out there. The movie does work sort of. If you are at the right age group, it probably works very well.",1194393600,,812,4.561643835616438

I came to the conclusion a week later that I would buy the DVD when it was released.  Sure enough, I came to Amazon for all my entertainment needs and pre-ordered the special edition DVD.  From the menu to the bonus materials, it's an awesome experience.  From the booming surround sound to the crisp picture, Transformers has me hooked.  Go buy it.",1194393600,,527,4.542553191489362
1613331,3,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" is absolutely worth seeing for the amazing special effects alone.  Those huge robots are so perfectly integrated into the live action, and realistically interrelate with the human actors, that somebody needs to get an Oscar.  This is some great visual effects work.

The story, however, is only okay.  There's some attempt to both pay attention to the humans and make the robots' back story compelling, but both initiatives ultimately give way to endless explosions, battles, and people yelling at one another about this or that impending disaster.  Like I said, the story's not horrible, but this is no ""Aliens"" or ""Terminator"", where the dramatic facial expressions of the heroes and villains, and their ultimate fates, are every bit as engrossing as the huge effects.

Also, while I'm all for movies thinking out of the box and not always playing it safe, a conversation about a, well... mature topic, between Shia Labeouf's character and his parents (""What have you been doing in your room for so long?"") just felt embarrassing and out of place in a movie about big robots.  If you're watching this movie with your kids, go get yourself a snack at the start of this scene.  You'll spare yourself the awkward moment with your kids, some pointed questions, or both.

I bought the single-disc version of ""Transformers"", which features a nice widescreen print, good sound, and little else.  Oh, yes-- you do get a nice sneak peek at Marvel's upcoming ""Iron Man"" (but only after you watch the entirety of ""Transformers"").  The single disc was fine for me.  I generally have to like a movie more than just a little to work up the enthusiasm to dive into all those ""making of"" and ""behind the scenes"" special features.",1194307200,2,1730,4.907216494845361

1613359,5,B00005JPNO,"Optimus Prime doesn't say this in the movie but I remember him saying it in the cartoon from the 80's which I was a big fan of. Yes I did collect them as toys. I will admit I had Optimus Prime.
June 2007 saw the release of Transformers on the big screen directed by Michael Bay. If you were a fan of the 80's cartoon or like action, sci-fi, fantasy, and a little bit of drama, you would like this movie. Yes it is heavily computer generated but in my opinion it was great and definately not overkill.

Computer Generating effects:
The transformers themselves were nicely done. They looked close to what they looked like from the cartoon (with a touch of 21st centry magic). Bumblebee however is a Camaro in the movie, not a Volkwagon Beetle from the cartoon. Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons, wasn't a gun from the cartoon. My favorite of the evil Decepticons was Barracade the police car. Of course earlier in the reviews you know who my favorite Autobot is---Optimus Prime. All of the transformers were terrifically done by the Industrial Light and Magic team.

Acting:
Shia Labeouf (Holes, iRobot) is a great actor. John Turturro was somewhat strange in the movie and kind of a little on the overkill side but not by much. Megan Fox, well all I have to say is, WOW! She is gorgeous and a great actress as well. She makes me forget about Jessica Alba (sorry, Jessica, we can still be friends lol). Jon Voight (Mission: Impossible, Anoconda) was good as the President of the United States. In all the acting was great by everyone in the film.

The Movie:
The AutoBots (good robots) and the Decepticons (evil robots) can transform from robot form to something mechanical. In this case most of the transformers from both sides can become cars, trucks, airplanes and helicopters. For example: Optimus Prime can turn into a tractor trailer (Optimus being the truck itself), Bumblebee is a camaro (in the movie), and Barracade was a police car. Many years ago a object from their world fell onto earth and was burried for years. This was the Allspark which carries an enormous amount of energy. Megatron who crashed on earth looking for it. Megatron wants the AllSpark to bind with it and destroy the earth and all of humankind. He detests humans. Sam Witwicky's grandfather who was an acheologist , stumbled upon Megatron in a glacier in the North Pole I believe, and accidently activated Megatron's homing beacon which alerts the Transformers.(Im not going to tell you everything :-)) All of them want to find the AllSpark. Optimus Prime wants to find it before Megatron because he believes in the humans, and doesnt want to see earth to suffer the same fate that their planet has become. In the movie small battles between the Transformers make us wait for the finale: Optimus Prime against Megatron. Who wins? Is this the end of humankind? Will Megatron get the Allspark before Optimus?
 This DVD comes with no extras just a widescreen version for 16:9 TV's, Dolby Digital 5.1, and subtitles. The 2-disc edition give you all of this and the making of the movie.
 This is a fantastic movie for both the generation who grew up with the Transformers during the 1980's, as well as the young generation of today. Many of my student who were born way after the original cartoon was aired loved the movie. They were even surprised that I was that old when the cartoon was on T.V. It's a good family movie (action, drama, sci-fi)although it is PG-13 for mild violence and some sexual humor (See Sam talking with his parents about sex when they discover Megan Fox in his room).",1194220800,2,3575,4.6682539682539685

1613375,4,B00005JPNO,"Sometimes you have to wonder just how far the envelope can be pushed on film and this movie might be at that limit.  Making thousands of moving parts transform on screen and make it look believable is quite an accomplishment.  For what it's worth the FX are remarkable; if nothing else the effects are worth watching the movie just to see.  The story, about the title robot's search for a galaxy changing device called the Allspark is decent even if it doesn't quite make sense.  The human cast is pretty good, though John Turturro is far too comical and quirky to play the secret government agent seriously; his inclusion screams parody.  It is really nice to see John Voight get to actually shoot a gun and see some action for once; he always seems to be pegged for dramatic-non-violent roles, but this time he gets to go a couple rounds with an evil robot [that had to be fun].

1613379,5,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" is not just for the fans of the toys or cartoons.  The film's not even limited to sci-fi or action-adventure junkies. Although, it does have enough action and special effects to keep your eyes popping, ""Transformers"" also has some pretty decent humor and some very good lines, including the title of this review.

It all begins with a boy and his car--or dreams thereof.  Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is selling heirlooms from his Great-Grandfather's arctic exploration on ebay to fund his first car. He's the class nerd--and he really is hoping for something to improve his image.

When they get to the car lot, Sam's entranced by a vintage yellow Camaro with black stripes, which he naturally hopes will be a chick magnet--turns out, the car's an Autobot named Bumblebee and he's chosen to protect Sam.

""Fifty years from now, when you're looking back at your life, don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car?""

Sam asks Mikaela (Megan Fox) the girl who's too cool for him. This begins an adventure for the two of them fighting to save the world against the Evil Decepticons.

ILM has probably busted the special-effects 'light-and-sound barrier' on ""Transformers"".  One of my favorite scenes is when Mikaela challenges why Bumblebee is a rusty old Camaro.  The car opens the door for them to get out, then drives off, only to return as a brand new Camaro.

Yes, that scene had me laughing.  There were many others, too.  One in particular was when a combat soldier had to call East Indian Tech support for help with his gear.  How many of us can relate to that?

We rented ""Transformers,"" but I've added it to the Wish List for a permanent addition to the collection.",1193961600,,1709,4.672240802675585

1613382,5,B00005JPNO,"I've never been a fan of transformers movies and i have never seen the cartoon, so this review is completely contingent on a movie buffs point of view.  First of all, i am surprised to find out that most reviewers did not like the story elements of transformers, i personally thought that it was a good story for the type of movie they where trying to create.  The story brought elements of comedy and romance to a movie that would have otherwise been a 2 and a half hour robot on robot slug fest.  Also, the search for ""the cube"" gave the movie the opportunity to create heroic personalities in the character development to give the movie a more epic feel.  I won't disagree with the fact that the overall story was simplistic and a bit pedantic, relying on humarous characters to give the story more cutting edge, however, i enjoyed it, and that is the reason i go to watch a movie, it's to enjoy it.

The special effects in this movie are absolutely phoenaminal.  Lots of explosions, plenty of robot fighting, meteior showers, desert war scenes, falling sky scrapers, collapsing bridges and vehicles flailing within inches of the protagonists face!  Michael Bay really does know how to take the viewer on a roller coaster ride.  Now don't get me wrong, the special effects are great, but in no way, shape or form do they drive the movie, there is a difference between the special effect making the movie and the special effects sychronising with the movie, and this one defenetely poses the latter.  My favorite part of the movie visuals would defenetely have to go to the transformers.  The way they move when they are calmly talking to the protagonist in comparison to the way they move when they are ramming each other through concrete makes them feel as real as any of the humans throughout the movie, and the transformations look absolutely amazing.

Since i'am reviewing not only the movie but the hd dvd itself i could not in good conscience leave out the special features.  They have plenty of commentaries depicting the history of transformers, trailers to some of next years hottest blockbusters, and a special effcts commentary which is actually incredibly fun to watch.  Also, this truly is one of the best looking hd dvd movies on the market and if you have an hd compatable tv, and you really wanna test its image capabilities then look no further.

Everytime there was going to be two robots getting it head on, there would be a pan to another event happeing with the humans, it's like Bay & Co. were afraid to tackel the commitment on making robot battles in complete sequences. But other than that that's my only complaint. It was fun from begining to end. And yes it is better than Armaggedon, as was said by some random kid about the meteor hitting near, where he was standing. Way to poke fun at yourself Michael Bay.

1613424,3,B00005JPNO,"On the whole, I was not impressed with Transformers.  You can try and dismiss its shallow story and numerous inconsistencies and flaws by saying that it is a light hearted movie.  But that is more an excuse than not.  After all, you can have a good light hearted movie can't you? Others have done it before and will again.

What the movie does have going for it are great special effects and genuinely impressive headliners (The Transformers themselves).  The action sequences are enjoyable and a feast for the senses.  But they are also relegated to the last half of the movie.  If this were the whole movie I'd give it 5 stars.  But it isn't the whole movie.

The first half of the movie centers around our protagonist, a semi-annoying and bumbling person too old to be cast as a high schooler and, predictably, only concerned with getting a car and impressing another student (too old to be his love interest and therefor way too old to be a student also).  The car he lands from a used car dealership is Bumblebee (now a Camaro).  How did the car dealership sell the car without a title, who knows, who cares, this isn't the type of movie to be weighted down with such things.  The story just goes on.

By the latter portion of the movie our main character, through Bumblebee, has met the rest of the Autobots and some childish (and unnecessary) attempts at humor are now out of the way - nothing says funny like peeing jokes.  So lets have a car pee on the human, that will be so funny! The Autobots have laid out what needs to be done and so they are off to get the All-spark and save the world, or worlds, or something.  It really isn't that important.  The Decepticons also want the All-spark and so there are some cool battles and then a resolution.  Guy gets girl, old Camaro becomes new Camaro (OK, fine, that happened in the first half of the movie) and Megatron (who is now not a gun but a jet-sorta-thingy) is out of the picture except maybe not, who knows?

I will admit that as far as reviews go, there isn't much meat here, but there isn't much meat to Transformers either.  A lot of people liked it and I say good for them.  Personally, I found it mostly dull, childish and hard to sit through.  I think there was a lot of room for originality but the story is so boringly simple-minded and rushed and very by-the-book feeling.  It is, at its core, a copy of almost every other summer blockbuster movie but with giant robots wreaking the disaster and an unlikely protagonist to make all the wrong moves yet somehow save us all...oh wait, that last part has been done before hasn't it.

1613425,4,B00005JPNO,"There is a time and a place for POPCORN MOVIES. There is a time and a place to just let it all hang out and destroy and explode and dazzle... TRANSFORMERS was it.

Apparently I'm too old to have been into TRANSFORMERS when I was a kid, but I'm still a kid at heart and I can slide back into imagination land pretty easily. Yet, it was made much easier by the competent story telling and slam bam effects orchestrated by Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg.

First of all. I'm not a Michael Bay fan. His seizure inducing ARMAGEDON was the first sign of a director who was way too full of himself. He made the movie with not a single shot in the entire film that lasted longer than 5 seconds. It was too spastic, MTVish and had a style to it that took you right out of the reality of it, and made you think you were watching one big 2 hour commercial. You give the man a script... and he'll cut it in half and insert multiple explosions... most highly ridiculous and unrealistic... as was the case with THE ISLAND.

I could go on and on about why Michael Bay is one of my least favorite directors... I mean, how can you take a silver platter story like PEARL HARBOR and make it into a storyless popcorn movie?

Yet, now we have TRANSFORMERS. Sure, all the Michael Bay patents are present... the constant DAWN skyline that is present in nearly all of his films, the exploding buildings, flying granite, spastic editing... at times... yet, for some reason... it worked here. It worked in an unrealistic world scenario. It worked in a movie that had you watching cars, trucks, motorcycles and cell phones that turn into robots.... or visa versa.

Throw in a solid performance by Shia LeBeouf and a decent performance by Megan Fox in her first BIG SCREEN MOVIE role... well... maybe she just looked good. Then add some good hearted fun from a robot/car named Bumble-Bee. Not to mention, a pheasible personal connection between the 3 of them.

Huh? Michael Bay's style may have finally suited something properly. TRANSFORMERS is plain and simple, sheer fun and action. Strangely enough, Michael Bay managed to keep a solid storyline throughout the film to boot. It's well worth the ride and something that will be remembered and rewatched for a long time... unlike most popcorn movies.",1193616000,3,2275,4.563725490196078

I had a few problems with the film. For example, I would have preferred the camera to step back a little bit so I can enjoy the hard-hitting carnage and the transformations. I don't know if its because I was sitting a little too close to the screen or its really how it was. I wouldn't mind a second viewing just to confirm this, the movie was good enough for me to find out. It was genuinely entertaining, especially the humor and Bumblebee.

Not since 'Titanic' has there been a movie so disappointing. Transformers looks good, but the script... Holy Mary Mother of God save us from that stupid, insipid, insulting script.

It has at least one of the stupidest moments in motion picture history in (I won't go into detail, but I will say this: you will be f'in AMAZED at how stealthy giant transforming robots can be-- apparently NO BODY can hear them!).

1613430,4,B00005JPNO,"When I first heard about Transformers being made into a movie, I was excited. When I heard Michael Bay was directing, I was less excited. I haven't seen all of the films he's directed, but I was a bit disappointed with the several I have seen. His movies tend to rely heavily on action sequences. The action scenes in all his films are extremely well done. Everything in between seems to be missing that spark the action scenes have. I wouldn't say that the rest of the films are bad, but it's just missing something. I'm referring to things like dialogue, the script, and the scenes that link the action sequences together. The acting is usually quite good in a Michael Bay film or you can tell the actors involved did the best they could with what they were given. So naturally, I started having doubts about Transformers.

I was never a rabid Transformers fan. I've always liked them, but I don't recall watching much of the original cartoon series. I watched a lot of the later ones and Beast Wars/Machines. So the fact that the movie strayed away from its roots didn't really bother me all that much. The plot basically revolves around the Autobots fighting off the Decepticons from getting possession of the Allspark, which could either save them from extinction or grant them ultimate power. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, wants to save Cybertron while Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons, wants to conquer the universe and will go through anyone and anything in his way to do so. The Allspark was blasted off of Cybertron, their home planet, by the Autobots but Megatron went to find it. He winds up finding it on Earth. Unfortunately for him, he tracked it to the Arctic Ocean and was eventually frozen. A captain, who was trying to get his ship through solid ice, accidentally found Megatron. Megatron used the last of his energy to embed the location of the Allspark in the captain's glasses. That captain was the great, great grandfather of Sam Witwicky who is in the possession of his grandfather's glasses. Sam's father is also buying him his first car; a yellow Camaro which winds up being the Autobot, Bumblebee. So as the Autobots and Decepticons arrive on Earth, their first objective is to find Sam and get ahold of these glasses.

The main problem I was thinking this film was going to have was that the story was going to be close to nonexistent and I thought the movie would suffer because of it. Can a movie rely solely on giant robots fighting each other and be good? Apparently so. There is a story there, but you're probably not going to care much about it by the time the movie kicks into gear. It's impressive when the Transformers first show up. Mainly because they look incredibly realistic. In the past, I've been less than impressed with scenes that rely heavily on CGI because you can tell that what you're seeing is just that...CGI. I've never seen CGI characters look this good though. Most of the time when the actors wind up interacting with computer generated characters, those actors also become computer generated. The Spider-Man films are a good example. Like when Doctor Octopus carries Mary Jane up that building after he kidnaps her from the coffee shop. You can tell they're both computer generated. When the actors interacted with the Transformers, they either didn't make them CGI or it was done better because it looked phenomenal and believable the entire time. Well...as believable as transforming robots can be. And the fight scenes are where the movie really hooks you. There is so much going on that you'll want to see the movie more than once just so you can come back and see if there's anything you missed...because you know you did.

The other thing that really impressed me in this film was Shia LaBeouf. I've been impressed with him for awhile now, but it's like he always raises the bar of what I expect from him in each film he's a part of. I expect great things from this kid and I have a feeling I won't be disappointed.

This is probably the best movie you're going to see this summer. If you want to see a movie that's exciting and doesn't let up until the credits roll, then this is the film for you.

The score by Steve Jablonsky will give you goose bumps. I'll probably buy it as well and I've never bought the score of a movie ever before. The soundtrack including linkin park's ""what I've done"" will smash your senses.

This movie is the reason why giant tv screens, high definition movies and surround sound systems exist.",1193443200,,551,4.288461538461538

1613434,5,B00005JPNO,"I've been a fan since the Generation 1 days back in the eighties with the original cartoon and when I heard they were making a live action CGI movie a good three years ago I was excited to say the least!
I hobbled to the advanced premier on crutches after my knee surgery and I was blown away by the movie even though the characters had changed designs and so forth but Transformers needed a fresh start and Michael Bay delivered the goods and it had a more broad spectrum appeal to audiences rather than just appealing to hardcore Transformers fans that only they would know what was going on. The special effects are mind blowing, the company ILM or industrial light and magic did about 75% of the work and did an amazing job, Digital Domain now owned by Michael Bay did the rest and did great work too.
The musical score is one of the best in hollywood blockbuster films and I recommend picking up the musical score too, make sure you notice the difference between the musical score by Steve Jablonsky released on October 9th 2007 and not just the songs by various artists released earlier.
I saw Transformers four times in the regular theaters and once in the Imax theater, Imax was an awesome experience with a sixty foot tall screen by eighty feet wide and a twelve thousand watt stereo system and with Michael Bays visual style it really made it feel like you were a part of the action.
Action,action,action and a good story too!
If the movie is ever released on the big screen again especially Imax then I'm there again!
I HIGHLY recommend the two disc dvd set, best part is there are NO annoying ads, commercials or even any previews of anything else, it goes right into the movie after the start up menu of course and the bonus material on disc two is great with some hidden ""easter eggs"" too.
The dvd has sold over 8.3 million copies in its first week and over 190 thousand in the HD DVD version and also set new dvd sales records so you might have troubles finding it in stores so buying online will probably avoid that and no lines to deal with etc,etc.
I look forward to the sequels, yes, they are thinking at least a trilogy so far and the next one is in the works due to be released the end of June 2009.

1613437,5,B00005JPNO,"Though I had already watched this movie in theater, I didn't hesitate a second in purchasing this HD-DVD version.  Along with Planet Earth, Transformers ranks right up there in terms of visual spectacles.

Most of you probably are already familiar with the storyline so I won't bore you with it.  Yes, it is cheesy, but no one expects a Oscar worthy tear-jerker from an action flick, especially one adapted from an 80's cartoon.

This HD-DVD comes with two disk, both HD, the first one is the feature film and the second one is the special features filled with ~2 hours of behind-the-scenes video shot during production.  If that is your thing, you will have plenty to chew through and find out how the film was made, things to know about cast member, occasional out-takes and bloopers, etc, etc.

On top of all that, the feature film disk also has a section of Extras, which is what I consider the Jewel of this HD-DVD set.  The Extras here include: 1. Commentary by Director Michael Bay, which can be laid over the film as usual; 2. HUD, which is a plurality of pop-ups throughout the film giving viewers interesting facts and knowledges, etc., it is done without being intrusive; and 3. Web Enabled Features, and this is the best part of them all.  You will need an internet connection on your HD player to ""activate""/download the Web Features, not all portions of the Web Features  are released yet, but so far it has 6 amature-like videos showing people encountering transformers, and an Intelligence Mode, which tracks the film with a GPS locator of each particular scene; Robot status panel, which shows which transformer is in the scene and its status/damage incurred; and another pop-up info panel that gives facts which are true to the film.  Most of these facts are down right hilarious, for instance, towards the end of the film when Sam Witwicky is to go into an abandoned building and climb to top so he can be evacuated by a chopper, the Pop-up facts states ""Only two years ago, this building housed one of the biggest sub-prim mortgage lenders in the country"", or ""Agent Simmons (John Turturro) is now the Head of Security at Costco Co."" after Sector 7 is disbanded.

1613453,1,B00005JPNO,"...for saying that disingenuous Machiavellians are easily housebroken. That clearly wins the prize for being the most juvenile and impulsive thing I've ever heard. Let's get down to business: He says that hanging out with patronizing Philistines is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. This is at best wrong. At worst, it is a lie. In the past, I've said that his modus operandi is to give lunatics control of the asylum. Were I to make such a generalization today, it would contain a few ""weasel words"" -- an escape hatch or that indispensable cliche that he descends from a long line of mumpish punks who like to clear-cut ancient forest lands. But because even those few who benefit from his announcements fail to recognize their current manifestation as a poxy, combative form of Comstockism, I am not ready to retract my conviction or to recant error. More often than not, the best thing about him is the way that he encourages us to lay out some ideas and interpretations that hold the potential for insight. No, wait; Optimus doesn't encourage that. On the contrary, he discourages us from admitting that he likes to compare his mottos to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. Once we have absorbed and understood his tyrannical wheelings and dealings, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to take personal action and improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come.

Yes, you heard me right; whenever Optimus announces that truth is whatever your grievance group says it is, his minions applaud on cue and the accolades are long and ostentatious. What's funny is that they don't provide similar feedback whenever I tell them that if Optimus were paying attention -- which it would seem he is not, as I've already gone over this -- he'd see that he is driving me nuts. I can't take it anymore! What's interesting is that we were put on this planet to be active, to struggle, and to illustrate the virtues that Optimus lacks -- courage, truthfulness, courtesy, honesty, diligence, chivalry, loyalty, and industry. We were not put here to scapegoat easy, unpopular targets, thereby diverting responsibility from more culpable parties, as Optimus might insist. I use such language purposefully -- and somewhat sardonically -- to illustrate how this cannot go on much longer. He may mean well but his equivocations are a cesspool of vigilantism. If you doubt this, just ask around. Optimus once used his notoriety, name recognition, and national fund-raising base to champion censorship in the name of free speech, intolerance in the name of tolerance, and oppression in the name of freedom. Now that that's cleared up, I'll continue with what I was saying before, that ageism is not merely an attack on our moral fiber. It is also a politically motivated attack on knowledge. The recent outrage at Optimus Prime's commentaries may point to a brighter future. For now, however, I must leave you knowing that he often uses the phrase, ""Studies show that..."", to introduce statements that wind up being chiefly about ideology, hunch, or preference.",1193270400,4,3304,5.018214936247723

I mean, how serious can you make a movie about robots that come to earth and transform into cars?? Everything is hammed up and over the top. (some painfully cheezy moment here).

1613458,3,B00005JPNO,"I have to say that Micheal Bay was very fortunate that this is a new generation. And the fact that a lot of younger people are not familiar with the original franchise people were willing to compromise. It is always people that don't have the knowledge of a franchise are the ones that have the ability to make it happen. Because I truly believe anyone that was a true fan of the franchise would have kept the designs as true to character as possible. The only person remotely that looked like themselves was Optimus Prime. Starscream was really poorly designed and Megatron. In the extra footage ""they stated that they changed the design of megatron because they didn't want people carrying him around ? Megatron should have been a cannon on a tripod and it should have resembled the character more than that. That was the beauty of the series the cool distinct designs of the robots. Sure you have to update but at least try to update to make them look similar. I mean we do not have robots walking around the planet now. So anything would have been futuristic in this day in age. Sound wave was an amazing character he was reduced to a parasite (Frenzy). I really couldn't tell what Megatron was when he transformed to either form he just looked like a big mass of metal. There were no color definition in any of the Decepticon's  or anything. Bumblebee and Prime I can say were the only justice that was done. Shea was ok in the film but it should have been more about the robots than him. Over all the CGI was done right it looked very real. And the movie had energy but I just hated the poor designs and poor character development. Soundwave, Megatron and Starcream were amazingly designed characters even in the 80's. And are main driving forces in the cartoon and deserved better justice ! I hope that if Micheal Bay isn't in charge of Part 2 these things are addressed. In the original cartoon they all mutated as the generations changed so they still can make it happen the right way, hopefully they will. The only reason I am willing to except this because at least an effort was made. And I have waited on this 20 years. I am really hoping the Voltron movie stays true to form. Because sometimes updating doesn't necessarily mean better ! Modify is a more viable this day in age especially when your talking about a cult classic !",1193270400,3,2342,4.497652582159624
1613459,3,B00005JPNO,"I agree with many of the reviewers, which gave this a bad review. (The bad reviews are pretty funny to read too!)

1.  Sure Michael Bay is a hack.  The man is way overpaid for making pretty obvious choices.  I mean the movie basically takes Independence Day, and superimposes the Transformers story, with the usual cut sequences that contain the written title of the location (you know, to add to the global tension of the film).

Example:

CIA Headquarters
Langley Virginia
0700 Zulu
(LOL!  C'mon you know you've seen it in every big budget/disaster pic!)

2. Sure many of the plot points are superficial and overly cute.  The Allspark?  Witwicky?  The scene where they're avoiding the lawn furniture? Complete wastes of celluloid.  Imagine if the film had not only compelling visuals, and sound, but also a gut wrenching story that made you really care about the characters.

3. Absolutely they took liberties with the core heritage and history of the Transformers.  No, Megatron is not a jet.  No, Bumblebee is not a Camaro (although I agree with the choice since a Mustang is far more hard core than a Vokswagen Bug!).  And where are Devastator, Soundwave, and company?  They were a little light on bots, and a little heavy on humans.  Plus if they could get the original actor for the voice of Optimus, why not for the voice of Megatron?  I checked the net, Chris Latta (the original Starscream) may have shuffled off the ""mortal coil"", but Frank Welker (the original voice of Megatron and a bunch of others),  is still alive and kicking.  His Megatron voice still sends chills up my spine!  I've known Megatron, Hugo Weaving is no Megatron!  At least not my childhood memory of Megatron.

But despite all this I'm giving it a solid three stars.  C'mon, you can't tell me seeing the old favorites in live action wasn't amazing.  Plus the visuals were stunning.  The scene where the Decepticons mount up for the final assault and the subtitle ""All Hail Megatron"" crawls across the screen is giving me goose bumps even as I type this.

So, sure Optimus Prime's legs may be a little skinnier than you remember in the toon, but sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy this movie for the impressive action sequences and summer fare that it is.

1613460,5,B00005JPNO,"There are moments when a concept that is born in the past, becomes fully realized in the future.  Some creators can `see' into a future and craft a product that screams out `Told ya!'.  George Lucas was like that with Star Wars.  Lester Dent, Issac Asimov, and a host of other authors wrote what is now, decades before the real items existed.

Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay, took a hit concept from the 80's and 90's, and with the assistance of exceptional CGI, turned out a movie that surprised film goers around the world.

Transformers' Sam Witwicky, begins this adventure of a lifetime carshopping with Dad.  In the Porsche lot, out of the Porsche lot, into the used car lot.  Sam learns a valuable lesson from the salesman, you don't choose a car, it chooses you.  And so a beat up Camaro chooses his `master', while destroying the car lot.  And so Bumblebee enters his life, and soon, a full blown war between the Decepticons and Autobots engulfs his home town.

Not only is there action, but humor as well.  Sam, his girlfriend, the US military, and his robot friends exchange barbs like `I bought a car.  Turned out to be a robot.  Who knew?'  And the `discussion' from Sam's mother on why he had to lock the door?  `Were you masterbating?  Or should we call it your private time.....?'  It's touches like that which turn this film from a CGI dominated production into a film you can watch and enjoy.

Sure, it'll re-introduce many of the Transformers back into pop culture.  Sure, there will be a sequel.  Yes, the comic will come back one more time.  And yes, it will be a hit one more time.
Don't forget the toys....

1613461,5,B00005JPNO,"First off, I've been a Transformers fan for about ten years now (I'm a teenager), and I had looked forward to this film ever since it was announced over two years ago. And after obtaining it on DVD, I've got to say that I continue to simply LOVE it!

The basic story is that the Allspark, an alien cube responsible for creating the Transformer race, is hidden somewhere on Earth, and through some interesting (but wierd) events, a teenager named Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) befriends the Autobots and becomes an indirect savior of the world.

Some major players from the Transformers universe return in this new story, such as Optimus Prime (voiced by the classic Peter Cullen), Megatron (Hugo Weaving of the Matrix Trilogy), Starscream, and Bumblebee. Speaking of the robots, the action and CGI in the movie is probably the best I've seen yet.

The acting is interesting, ranging from real-world believable to cartoon-like and absurd, but it only helps make this a fun movie. Overall, I believe that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Being rated PG-13, there are many parts that are fun for families to watch, but some suggestive humor and a lot of explosion-filled action scenes might be dangerous for young children to watch.

As for DVD itself, it is very nice. On the first disc, you get the feature film and a pretty insightful commentary from the director, Michael Bay. On the second disc, you get about two hours of making-of featurettes, trailers for the film, a concept art montage, and some easter eggs. The material covers the US military's involvement, acting, visual effects, and more, making the DVD a worthy package. There could have been some more material here, but these are already good for repeated viewings.

The only good thing about it was the quality of the CGI used to render the robots, despite the poor designs of said robots. The plot was a typical action movie plot, with no development. Most of the robots, who were little more than guest stars in their own movie, got no character development. On top of that, you have a story that treated the franchise, which has been successful for 20+ years, with little to no respect.

The film is wildly unique and that filters down to everything, the action, the locations, and even the comedy (which surprisingly enough there is a lot). Of course no great action movie would be complete without a weak story line. But don't worry with all the action and special effects flying around you shouldn't even pay attention to the plot, because thats not what this movie is about.

I came in willing to look the other way at certain weaknesses, knowing full-well that this was first and foremost a Michael Bay movie and, therefor, guaranteed to offer a certain amount of junk. I looked the other way when Bumblebee peed on the officer and overindulged in the first few battles between the lumbering giants (who look great, by the way, even if their voices are for the most part poorly chosen).

But then came the scene where the Autobots are ""creeping"" around the house. In the middle of the suburbs. Giant, twenty-ton machines sneaking around a house and avoiding detection in a moment intended to appeal to the funny bone of perhaps only the most dimwitted of children. It was too much. Not even the excellent remaining battle sequences were enough to jump-start the child in me and reignite the enthusiasm I had when I first watched the animated movie.

I never saw the original Transformers movie, but I stall have an original Optimus Prime toy.  The key to this new movie version is: turn off your brain and just have fun!  It's all been said before, but a few of the common complaints I've read on here:

The dialogue - i.e. Prime saying ""my bad.""  Were you listening when he said they learned our language from the ""world wide web?""  Do you see how the majority of people communicate online?

Car-commercial vehicle selection: Much easier to work with one main company for the use of their vehicle designs.  The 2008 Camaros used were prototypes valued at, what, $50,000 each?  And just how *did* Megatron shrink to the size of a handgun?  As the special features explain, in the new designs they tried to have the robots and vehicles use the same volume.

The ""m""-word scene: what else would a teenage boy be doing in his room with the door locked?  Besides, this movie is not geared toward small children - it's geared for the 25-35-year-olds who grew up with this stuff.  The movie is set to take ups back 20 years to our childhood, but with characters set in today's world, and for better or for worse, that's our world.

That said, I said in awe, eyes glued to the screen for the entire 2+ hours and loved every minute of it (watching the DVD version).  I just about cheered when I saw that Peterbilt roll up :P

Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to watch this spectacle again!",1193011200,3,1585,4.470383275261324

1613491,3,B00005JPNO,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been mentioned.  I'll give a little of the movie away so if you don't want to read - just skip my review now.

There are a few different versions of this movie... if you saw the iMax version that might still be out, it has some noticeably different scenes in it.  Sector 7 and a coupe of dialogues too.  The one here most closely resembles the regular theatrical release from July.  As for the movie itself, it's got some great action and amazing effects.  It's about good robots and bad robots trying to be the first to find the ""All Spark"" - if it fell into Decepticon hands (bad guys), they'd try to take over the universe.  The detail and transformations were neat.  They did a fantastic job with that and made it extremely realistic.  And in the DVD they showed how they did some of the action scenes & what they did to design the robots.  My favorite character though was actually John Turturro's... he & Sam's mother/father definitely saved the acting... as beautiful as Megan Fox is IMO, she seemed rather stiff & emotionless.  But they kept with some basic themes, which was cool (all spark/energon cube) and had soem funny moments like the XBox 360 transforming & the soda machine...

The bad?  After you see the movie a few times (I admittedly probably saw it one too many times) you pick up on a few things that aren't so polished - like when Sam's car broke down & the girl decides to walk home - the passenger door was open, yet it's suddenly closed when he goes after her.  Or when the blond girl goes to Anthony Anderson's house... the taxi changes color.  :)  But again maybe these were done on purpose.  Also, Brawl was referred to as ""Devastator"", which probably ticked off a lot of Transformer's purists given that name's legendary status.  And then some of the military intelligence scenes (NOT the action scenes, those were good) seemed very poorly developed - although I understand they probably had to make a compromise in the movie since the 'bad guys' were pretty much all military vehicles.  Finally... Shia's character's top line must have been ""No!"" repeatedly or ""Go!"" repeatedly.  Made me miss Spike a little.  So IMO, not the best acting.  And ultimately, the blond girl was useless.  And maybe worst of all - they completely under-utilized a major generation one character & one of my favorites - Starscream.

So all in all, a very entertaining movie - definitely one of the biggest highlights of the summer.  I want to give it a higher rating because I love transforms and still collect em'.  But there was maybe one thing too much that made me knock it.  That one thing just might be the blatant lie in the 'development of Bumblebee' concept and his VW Bug roots... of course they didn't mention Volkswagon's response.  But... water under the bridge because the Camaro was cool.  Check it out!  And for some fans, be on the look-out for a version of this that has two miniature figurines in it - Optimus and Cliff Jumper.  This is most definitely a guy movie... but some things could've been much much better & I'd definitely recommend waiting (if you can) for a special edition uncut version.",1193011200,,3169,4.605357142857143

There are a lot of people who say the movie wasn't true to the original story, and gave it a bad review...I guess there wasn't any Star Wars conventions going on at the time.  The movie had a positive message (something rare these days).  Shia Labeouf was funny and Megan Fox is HOT.  The movie had something for everyone.  Funny scenes, tons of action, a little drama...it truly is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy.

If you thought the movie sucked because it didn't stay true to the original premise, or because you belived it was a giant infomercial for GM, get over it...Movies are made to make money.

1613504,1,B00005JPNO,"I just bought the TRANSFORMERS Exclusive 2-disk DVD Set yesterday. I was greatly ashamed of my purchase! Like most I grew up watching the TRANSFORMERS. Sitting in front of the television during summer vacation, with my pb, and j, and the happiest moment watching OPTIMUS PRIME. Care free, and loving life. When I went to the theator to see the movie I was skeptical. Can Michael Bay live up to our childhood memories? When I heard OPTIMUS PRIME'S voice for the first time in over twenty or so years, I was that kid again!!! For two, and a half hours I was in 1986 all over again. It was great! The movie to my surprise was good. Now my problem... I set out to buy the Exclusive 2-disk set for one reason, and one reason only. It is advertized as having TRANSFORMERS: BEGINNINGS Prequel dvd. Narrated by the voice of OPTIMUS PRIME (PETER CULLEN). Well how completly awsome is that?! Getting it home was another story. Upon poping this childhood memory into my dvd player, I get a cold hard unloving smack in the face! The prequel is not narrated by OPTIMUS PRIME, but narrated by BUMBLE BEE instead. Maybe half way thru you finally get PRIME, but hes only on for about five seconds. The whole selling point was PRIME! The movie disk didn't even include any special features. At least give me a Behind The Scenes, and maybe a Deleted Scene, or bloopers. Something! No instead I got a shiney cardboard box! Well thank you MICHAEL BAY!!! Now my life is complete. If they would have billed it as narrated by BUMBLE BEE it would have been a different story. Come on OPTIMUS PRIME is the opitamy of cool!  I beleve this to be a disgrace, and a mockory to all diehard TRANSFORMERS Fans. I hope the purchase of any more TRANSFORMERS DVDs are boycoted! I am greatly disapointed in DreamWorks for not standing up for us fans. Is this all just another way to turn a buck?! How can you tell us your going to give something cool as PRIME, and then take it all away? Have you no decentcie?! Have you no shame?! The whole point to DVDs is the fact we get some kind of special features. If they wanted to save the features as a two disk special then fine. However give a handfull of things to the guys who bought the prequels!!! Nothing spectacular, but something! And if your going to sell something based on OPTIMUS PRIME, then give us PRIME!!! Not BUMBLE BEE!!! A very disapointed fan!!!",1192924800,4,2373,4.455172413793103
1613505,2,B00005JPNO,"I was so hyped to see this movie after all the build up to Summer, man what a letdown.  My fears that Michael Bay would ruin this movie were completely realized.  The first HOUR is nothing but the kid screwing around with his car, add to that lame jokes, slapstick humor, too much emo teen angst, and the worst performance from John Turturro I've ever seen.  Not too mention they only gave Starscream one line in the ENTIRE film.  I seriuosly hope Bay keeps his threat not to direct the sequel, Steven Spielberg could have done such a better job himself.  Rent it, trust me you don't want to waste the money.

Edit: I've had over a year to let this film sink in, and my opinion of it has improved.  I've noticed a lot of Bay films are like that, cheesy and cliche at first, then they become comforting to watch over time.  I still want to see way more robot acting in the sequel, but without the need to set up a second movie, hopefully the action will kick off right from the start.",1192924800,6,983,4.247311827956989

I do not really understand the negative reviews.  Of course we all love the old Transformers, the movie and animated series.  However, this movie does need to sell, and to do that a lot of what you say in this movie had to be there.  Product placement being one of them, as I know a lot of people are upset the movie is commercialized.  It is not just this film, but many others.  I think that Michael Bay did an amazing job with this one, and you really have to be a ""film lover"" to understand the depth and creativity that goes into something to create this type of a masterpiece.  If not anything else, the last fight scene definitely speakers for itself.

I came in willing to look the other way at certain weaknesses, knowing full-well that this was first and foremost a Michael Bay movie and, therefor, guaranteed to offer a certain amount of junk. I looked the other way when Bumblebee peed on the officer and overindulged in the first few battles between the lumbering giants (who look great, by the way, even if their voices are for the most part poorly chosen).

But then came the scene where the Autobots are ""creeping"" around the house. In the middle of the suburbs. Giant, twenty-ton machines sneaking around a house and avoiding detection in a moment intended to appeal to the funny bone of perhaps only the most dimwitted of children. It was too much. Not even the excellent remaining battle sequences were enough to jump-start the child in me and reignite the enthusiasm I had when I first watched the animated movie.

I just recently watched the animated movie again and I still enjoyed it. But this one ... unfortunately, little remains of the nuances enjoyed by the original series. Expect cheesiness, a few great battles, and a lot of stilted dialogue and plot holes.",1192924800,,1237,4.722222222222222

1613557,5,B00005JPNO,"Let me begin by saying that I approached my viewing of this film without knowing much about the Autobot world of Transformers. I was well past the age of interest in such things when the Hasbro toys hit the market and to be honest I probably wouldn't have been interested even if I had been a young adolescent at the time. I happen to be one of those aberrant males who never developed an interest in things mechanical, especially cars. Hence you can imagine how uninspiring the thought of a feature film about a robotic alien race that can shapeshift into cars, trucks and planes must have sounded to me.

Having given my disclaimer I must now admit that I loved the film! The special effects were mind-boggling and the storyline fast and furious, with a infectious comedic flavoring spread throughout thanks to the immensely talented Shia Lebeouf. Add to the mix Megan Fox, one of the most attractive young women I've seen in quite a while and you're in for a great adventure that can be enjoyed by all (well maybe not so enjoyable for girls).

1613558,1,B00005JPNO,"I wanted to see this movie in a theatre but I'm glad I didn't.  Instead, some friends had the film on DVD and were eager for me to watch it.

I was sorry to disappoint them...but this movie was horrible.  A very, very long horrible movie with a lame music soundtrack.

I hated the characters.  The soldiers in the opening scene were so bland and hokey as they read their cliche-riddled lines that I hated them.  I especially hated the high school kids.  The bullying jock, the nerd who becomes a man, the hot chick with the checkered past.  Government officials and ultra-secret government officials charge into scenes and take turns taking control of everything.  A fat, black sassy car salesman exchanges insulting gestures with his mother and--not ten minutes later--another fat, sassy black man loudly argues with his grandmother.  Ugh.

This is a Michael Bay film and every character is in such broad and obnoxious strokes that I was literally rooting for the evil Transformer robot to kill everyone on Michael Bay's version of earth.

Meanwhile, every scene reminded me of other movies.  Other BETTER movies.  Alien machines rising from the ground are from WAR OF THE WORLDS.  Dueling alien machines fighting over the nerd--straight out of TERMINATOR 2.  The Section 7 goons--MEN IN BLACK.

There isn't one original scene in this movie.

The writing is cloying and atrocious, not to mention just nonsensically bad and structurally awkward.  And yet everyone can follow it because you can see everything coming a mile away.  How much painfully unfunny schtick can you endure before the good Transformers get their mechanical claws on the glasses they're after?  Be prepared for a lot.  How come the giant and powerful robots keep handing off the McGuffin of all power to helpless and stupid human beings?

My friends kept saying, ""But the special effects are awesome.""
They are.
But in the evil bargain of having to choose between awesome special effects and intelligent storytelling, I'll take the hubcaps hanging from fishing line every time.",1192752000,12,2049,4.979351032448378
1613559,2,B00005JPNO,"I'm an 80's baby, and yeah, I grew up with Transformers. There was something about these shape-shifting robots that really got me. I had it all; coloring books, stickers, collector cards, toys. So, when I heard they were invigorating Transformers with a movie, mixed emotions. Excited that my favorite cartoon was coming to the big screen, but scared that they might screw it up. My worse fears were realized when I watched it recently. I was honestly speechless. This was the movie everybody loved? That made 700 million worldwide?

In a gist, Cybertron, where the Transformers originated from has been destroyed due to a civil war between the Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). The cube of life (the essence of life for the Transformers) that was missing, somehow found it's way to earth. The Autobots want it so they can have a fresh new start elsewhere; the Decepticons want it so they can take control of machines on earth and eventually wipe out the human race. Caught in the middle is a boy, Sam and his friend, Mikaela.

I wouldn't go so far as to call this movie bad, it had a number of things going for it especially the visual effects. But when I start to enjoy the presence of Megan Fox more than the robots in a movie called ""Transformers"", something is seriously wrong. If the film-makers had stuck to the main plot and made a movie about the Autobots and Decepticons going head-to-head trying to outsmart each other to get the allspark, with the humans in the background...how cool would that have been? But instead, they decided to rehash Small Soldiers. Think about it, young teen boy comes to possession of a toy, toy is actually part of a group of noble good guys (Gorgonites), there are rogue military toys (Commando Elite) trying to defeat the Gorgonites. Young teen girl that boy has crush on, is unwillingly pulled into the mess and a bond develops between them. Replace toys with robots, Gorgonites with Autobots, Comman...ahh, you get the point. Heck, even Sam's dad was the dad from Small Soldiers, that's just plain lazy.

But where Small Soldiers was funny and even maniacal at times, Transformers have been reduced to goofs. Come on! The Decepticons are missing  of the movie. The Autobots, with the little screen time that they have, are made to look like clowns and wimps. The scene in the yard was cringe-worthy, and ""Leave Bumblebee because the humans are more important""? Yeah, right...when clearly, the real mighty Autobots could've easily overpowered the humans and saved Bumblebee WITHOUT actually killing the humans. Another thing was the final battle scene between the Decepticons and Autobots. I am all for a change in the robots, not expecting G1 Transformers here...but have them in different colors at least. I thought Starscream was Megatron until the real Megatron showed up somewhere else. Not to mention how clich the ending was with the humans appearing more triumphant that the Autobots themselves.

I can't say that I remember the original Transformers that well; it WAS a long time ago. But I remember Beast Wars very clearly, I watched it about 6 years ago, and that beats this movie in every aspect. This is a good action flick, but a bad ""Transformers"" movie. I was expecting less humor, more action between the Transformers and certainly less human involvement. Leave the transforming robots out of the equation and this movie would be called ""Boy and the Alien Robots"". The people I feel bad for the most is the younger kids out there. For they will never know the joy and excitement we had when watching the real Transformers.",1192752000,5,3605,4.826860841423948

1613563,4,B00005JPNO,"I finally had a chance to watch `Transformers' last night and I must say that for what it is, it is truly astonishing.  We all must remember that this is a pure action eye-candy type film, and on top of that it's based off of a children's cartoon so we cannot expect a very smart dramatic film here.  When walking into this film expecting to see amazing special effects, some crazy fight scenes and some (for lack of a better word) hot chicks, and `Transformers' delivers on all fronts, and delivers wonderfully.  The special effects are mind-blowing, the fight sequences are nothing short of spectacular and don't even get me started on the phenomenon that is Megan Fox.

The film centers around a group of alien life forms known as Autobots who come down to Earth to wage war with their enemies the Decepticons who are in pursuit of the AllSpark, a powerful device that could grant the owner the ability to rebuild their dying home planet.  It's really a power struggle, good against evil, which is like the basis for just about every film.

The humans become involved when Sam Witwicky buys his first car.  That car just so happens to have a mind of its own.  The car seems to know what Sam wants, which is to woo the beautiful Mikaela, and so the car tries its hardest to help in that pursuit.  When Sam watches his car transform into a giant robot he knows that he is in for the time of his life, and with Mikaela along for the ride it's all the better.  Sam is more involved though than he imagines for he is the link to finding the AllSpark.  While Sam is dodging the evil Decepticons with his newfound friend the US Government is planning on waging war against their newfound enemies.  You see the Decepticons have been hacking into Government files looking for the key to finding the AllSpark.

The first two thirds of the film really set us up for the epic battle that we have all been waiting for, when war is waged between the two robot clans.  The cool thing about `Transformers' though is that the action sequences are not the only great things about this film, in fact just about everything here is top notch.  Sure, the action sequences are probably the greatest parts of the film (I'm still debating since the inclusion of Megan Fox ranks pretty high) but each and every detail is well placed and entertaining.

Shia LaBeouf is making a good name for himself in the circuit of teen stars.  With a slew of successful films under his belt and even more to come he is quickly rising in the racks.  I've already mentioned Fox's beauty but she's a decent actress too, for what she's asked to do here.  Rachael Taylor (also hot) is great here as Maggie Madson, a young member of the team assigned to identify the source of these attacks, and Anthony Anderson is hilarious as usual (as is Bernie Mac in a very small cameo).  Jon Voight is somewhat lost here and John Turturro is just downright annoying, and Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are not given much to do but Kevin Dunn and Julie White are hilarious as Sam's parents.

Then again, it's not really the acting we're looking at though, it's those special effects, and they are brilliant as mentioned.  All in all I'm not fully convinced that this is Michael Bay's best work, then again I've only seen this movie once at this point.  I still feel that `The Island' and `Armageddon' are more accomplished and well rounded features, but time may change my mind as I am sure to watch this eye-popping spectacle over and over again.",1192752000,2,3493,4.5095238095238095
1613574,1,B00005JPNO,"One of these days very soon we are going to get to a point where audiences have seen just about everything that can be done with CG and Hollywood can no longer mask a terrible story with dazzling special effects.  Evidently that day has not yet come, because here we are in 2007 with Transformers.

  A person can ooh and ahh all they like about Transformers admittedly phenomenal special effects, but it still doesn't make a bad movie any less of a bad movie.  It's truly a sad statement when the cartoon Transformers movie which was made over twenty years ago trumps this big, loud, brainless mess in every way.  That film had an much deeper story, greater emotional impact and far better characters than this overblown train wreck even came close to.

  What I wanted going into Transformers was simply a great action movie.  My expectation was that the subject matter would be taken seriously and that the tone would be appropriate for a good action movie.  What I got instead, was an emphasis on misplaced ""American Pie"" style humor, thrown in no doubt, to appeal to the lowest common denominator of american movie going audiences.  (A trend which seemed to plague the bulk of 2007's summer blockbusters.) I also got an awful lot of unnecessary Michael Bay grandstanding and self indulgence.  (The director even went so far as to pat himself on the back with a shout out to ""Armageddon"".)

  Simply put, Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee and the rest deserved a far better movie than this.  I knew the film was in trouble the minute I heard the great Optimus Prime reduced to uttering such character insulting lines as ""my bad"".  I watched the film in utter embarrassment as the noble autobots bumbled around like complete idiots outside the main character's home trying to hide in the dark while inside the home, mom and dad were busy accusing young Sam of masturbating in his bed room.  I was made to squirm in my seat each time the poster boy character for ""product placement in disguise""-Frenzy, appeared on screen to transform into yet another product for us to buy, quickly becoming the most obnoxious character in film since Jar Jar Binks.

  I honestly can't believe this movie has reviewed as well as it has.  I guess because of this, we can probably look forward to more of the same mindless idiocy from the inevitable sequel.  And here I was hoping that the next Transformers movie could set its sights a little higher than neat-o special effects and potty humor.  ""My bad"".",1192752000,35,2482,4.689814814814815
1613575,2,B00005JPNO,"Original ""Transformers"" fans were generally about 8 years old or younger during their earlier Hasbro days of being cartoons and toys.  This film had a lot of good visual effects (actually way too much to a point of overkill redundancy).  However, I would have enjoyed this movie more if it had more of the Paul Verhoven effect (like Starship Troopers and Robocop I and II).  You would think that there would be a lot more blood, guts, and gory death with all that street destruction, but it seemed like nobody really got killed or even hurt with all that debris flying around.  But, I guess they kinda wanted to make this a movie for children to see.

And if that's the case, then why did they have to throw in that ""masturbation"" reference?  That scene alone with that controversial dialogue was just enough to kill this films appeal of wanting to own it and share it with the kids in my extended family.

Plus, with them throwing in some comedy (and dumb comedy at that) that just made this movie uncomfortable to watch.

This movie should have been made for kids and should have left of the masturbation reference.  Or, it should have been made Rated R with a lot more blood and gore to please a more mature bloodthirsty audience.

1613579,5,B00005JPNO,"I bought this movie, and I hadn't seen it in theaters, my brother had seen it and said it was really good.  I wanted it because I'm a sci-fi junkie and like this sort of thing.

I love this movie.  It's my second favorite sci-fi movie next to all the Star Wars movies, which are my first favorite sci-fi movies.  Anywa6y, back to Transformers.  I'd seen a little bit of the new animated series that was on Cartoon Network, but I'd never followed it regularly.  I watched the movie and loved the story.

It's about a boy named Sam Witwicky, who buys his first car, a transformer named Bumblebee, and discovers the Autobots and their quest to find the All Spark Cube.

The special effects are incredible, a mix of CGI and real stunts.  It may surprise a lot of people, but most of the stunts  involving flipped cars and explosions were real.  The CGI is mainly used for the Autobots and the Deceptacons.

I was also impressed that they used the real military in this movie.  A lot to the military in the movie are real military, with the exception of the main military characters.  They used the real technology and made it a very realistic movie.

I know a lot to the Transformers fans were irritated that they updated and changed some things, but they had to do that because Transformers was made in the '80s.  I like it the way they made it and it was very fun to watch.

Unlike a lot of people, I liked the human story lines involving the seven main characters and the Autobots, if it had just been about the Autobots and the Deceptacons, it would have been just another big budget special effects movie.  Having the human characters made it more about them and not just two big robot armies duking it out on our planet.

My favorite characters for the Autobots are Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Iron Hide, he was fun to watch as he rolled around and blasted stuff.

The DVD special features have a lot of featurettes about the making of the movie, the visual effects, the story, the involvement of the military and the trailers for the movie.

1613605,5,B00005JPNO,"I have been a fan of Transformers since the 80's. While I haven't kept up with the series since shortly after the 1985 movie, I have rewatched the G1 series. Michael Bay was right. They didn't hold up well to time, because we are all adults now and the simplistic themes stand out like a sore thumb. However, the concept was remarkable, the cartoon was a great influence for children, with the wonderful father-like nature of Optimus Prime, and even made fun of itself on more than one occasion(Starscream noting there was something vaguely familiar about Megatron's plans to conquer the universe.
Bay was not out to rehash the old, and on the same token, not out to ruin what we remembered about the Transformers. He succeeded in avoiding both.

I'll address the common complaints before I move to the positives.

1. The camera was too fast and too shaky. I understand where Bay was going with this. He was attempting to capture the chaotic nature of these insane battles between tons of robotic parts. Warfare is confusing, and half the time people are simply trying to stay alive. The camera reflected this confusion and chaos. I had no trouble keeping track of who was fighting who.

2. Excessive use of scantily clad girl. I think the point was to show that this girl, for all of her attractiveness, was stronger and more independent than given credit for. The scene with her and Bumblebee near the end showed her resolve and bravery. She was also there to give Sam motivation to do much of what he did. They matured together throughout the movie, and by the end, were very different from when they started. She also never screamed. Not once. Not when a red-eyed robot came crashing down on them, not when Frenzy was attacking, or even when Devastator was raising all kinds of unhappiness. That's pretty rare in movies.

3. It was a car/soda/whatever commercial. For the sake of realism, take a walk outside. You can't walk down the block without seeing a brand name item, especially as far as cars go. Secondly, the movie budget doesn't pay for itself. Bay had to make some strategic decisions with the vehicles in order to make this movie a success. VW wouldn't play ball with Bumblebee, either.

4. It's pro-military. Who do you think would step up IF something like this happened? It wouldn't be the merchant marines (No sharkiticons in this one). And yes, this is how Soldiers behave, and yes, we really are concerned about our troops, concerned about you all, and for the most part, really good people who want to help.

On to the positives...

The movie kept an excellent pace, without lagging or becoming hung on a side plot. The cast was excellent, and while I would have liked to have seen more Autobot/Decepticon action, this wasn't meant to be a robotic armegeddon. The current ones alone created ridiculous levels of destruction. Any more would have been a big mess. The FX were incredible, with intricate transformations and impressive integration of CGI into real scenes. The Soldier to Soldier dialogue was very accurate. Megatron was excellently done, and perhaps this is the way he should have been done all along. I also liked how Starscream was a fearsome as he was made out to be.

My only complaint is that Optimus should have been a stronger leader. Bay wanted a more natural, flawed leader, but what made Optimus who he was was the fact that he was beyond reproach. He still was a strong leader, but the nature of Optimus Prime is his near-perfection as a leader. So strong was his influence that Rodimus Prime certainly couldn't hold a candle to him.

I've pre-ordered this item since the day it was anounced and it had been advertised as special or deluxe edition where the box supossedly transforms into Optimus Prime even on Internet Sites, Radio Shows, etc... was advertised as so.

The story blew, the acting was godawful, and the whole Sector 7 bit was atrocious. This goes down as one of the worst movies of the year. Funny how this makes a ton of money, and great double feature films like Grindhouse make nothing.

The film is long, and I would say only 30 solid minutes are devoted to the action-considering the film is almost 2 1/2 hours. I pretty much had my finger on the FF button.

The sound transfer was much better in this film, than some of my other HDs, example; while watching 300, I had to keep turning the sound up during conversations, and back down for the action scenes.
With this film, I never touched the volume once.
The special features are the usual ""Making Of"" snipets you see on most DVDs, and of course a lot of backstory on the Transformers.
The special feature I'm looking forward to seeing the most is the ""Autobot HUD"" which, like the two Spiderman DVDs had, is while watching the movie information about the film or a particular scene will pop up on the screen ""Pop-up Video"" style (for those who remember that).

1613656,4,B00005JPNO,"No wonder Michael Bay's `Transformers' is destined to be one of the biggest box office smashes of 2007.  Looking at the commercial previews of the movie, I was not impressed.  Watching digitally enhanced transformer toys morphing across the screen looked too fake and too much.  It's good for kids, but I could wait for the DVD.  Not so.  After having watched the widescreen version on a small screen, I was in awe of the special effects and kept at the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  Thoroughly likable, the characters, the plot, and the dialogue are just all-out fun.

As has been told countless time, the story is based on Hasbro's Transformer  toys, and involves metallic monsters coming from outer space to absorb our resources, obtain a wayward cube, and rule the universe.  Just like the 'Gremlins'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gremlins/dp/B00005J6UR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gremlins</a>&nbsp;before them, `Transformers' have good and evil operators.  Here Optimus Prime and Megatron battle it out in the city making toys of humans and SUV's.

And in the human world there are two fronts:  One is in suburbia where a teenager, Sam Witwicksy (Shia LaBeouf) stumbles upon a disguised Transformer at a used car lot.  (LaBeouf plays a post-teenage incarnation of many Bruce Willis characters, and his Camero is not unlike ""Herbie, the Love Bug,"" with a lot more `tude and torque in his chassis.)  His side-kick is that all-too-familiar acquisition, Mikala (Megan Fox), a fantasy girl who dumps her mean-spirited jock boyfriend for him on a date where the accommodating car knows when to get them stranded.

Meanwhile all the power vibes are picked up by the military.  Captain Lennox (Josh Duriamel) is tough, breaking through the red-tape of an alien takeover, and F.B.I. Agent Simmons (played comically enough by John Tuturro) is on a state of hyper-alert, treating ordinary citizens as criminals.  Jon Voight plays a high-ranking military official, certain that our enemies are wreaking havoc from across the borders rather than across the skies.

With many fine movies under his belt, Shia LaBeouf is already a matinee idol of about the same stature as Tom Cruise.  His every man (kid) performance makes everything real.  Most of the rest of cast and crew keep this full-octane adventure from veering into snooze control.  I always admire a science fiction adventure that can alternate well between roller coaster suspense and big laughs.  Maybe it's not the same caliber as 'Star Wars'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-IV-A-New-Hope-1977-2004-Versions-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;in this respect, but it's conspicuously better than 'Armageddon,'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>&nbsp;for which there's even one reference.

I was quietly sitting in the theater to see another movie, through trailer after trailer, wondering whether the movie would ever start, and I saw the trailer for transformers. My first thought, What were those idiots thinking? Then I heard reviews about how great it was. One summer afternoon (after discovering the a/c wasn't going to be fixed in the apartment) a couple of us made our way to the cool air conditioned theater to see this (I also wanted to see the trailer for Cloverfield). It was great (the movie and the trailer).

There was actually a story line (whether good or not that depends on each individual person). Some love it some hate it. The special effects were great. It was funny (some say immature gags).

Other highlights include an amusing anecdote about how an Industrial Lights and Magic CGI animator from Japan spoke up in a meeting and got the gig to animate Optimus Prime, meeting and casting Shia LaBeouf, and candidly addressing the Internet/fanbase criticism about how he would ruin the franchise and talks about the artwork and script leaks. Love or hate the guy, he is the epitome of an ultra-confident, big-time Hollywood director and tells a lot of interesting, engaging and entertaining stories.

The second disc is dedicated to extra features broken down into three sections

""Our World"" includes four featurettes that examine the genesis of the story and how Bay wanted to make it edgier and more accessible to a mainstream audience. We see a very intense and energetic Bay on set blowing things up. The casting process is also examined with excerpts from Megan Fox's audition and footage of LaBeouf's ability to improvise during a given scene (cracking Fox up in the process). Bay's relationship with the U.S. military is also explored. He put some of the actors through weapon's training and was allowed to put certain vehicles in his film that had never been allowed to before. There is also a look at various location shoots, from White Sands, the Hoover Dam and L.A. Bay actually cut his fee in order to shoot in California with his own crew.

""Their War"" includes four featurettes that trace the origins of the franchise with the toys and clips from the cartoon. There is also a look at the rabid fanbase and why the Transformers appeal to them. The Autobots and the Decepticons are examined as are how Bay settled on the vehicles that are used in the movie as well as how they differed from their cartoon counterparts. We also see how ILM and Digital Domain did all of the film's special effects. Not surprisingly, some of the animators are hardcore Transformers fans. We also get to see rough animatics of certain sequences and how the actors worked with no robots during filming, just some guy holding a tall pole.

Finally, ""More Than Meets the Eye"" takes an action sequence and dissects all of its components from script to storyboard to animatics to the final version. We also see Bay and company scouting locations with on the set footage. There is also a small collection of concept artwork used in the creation of the film. Rounding things out are three trailers.",1192579200,3,2528,4.804597701149425
1613684,5,B00005JPNO,"I don't usually respond to reviews but I couldn't resist this one.  I was intrigued by another reviewer's discontent on, not only the movie, but also the director Michael Bay.  To the reviewer's credit, I would agree that this movie and just about all of Michael Bay movies are very formulaic eye candy with nothing more than high budgeted special effects and fairly thin plots to carry the audience to 2 hours and beyond.  But what I don't get is how someone, who obviously knew all this, can discredit a movie as well as its director after plopping down money to go see it.
  When my girlfriend and I spent our $20 we knew exactly what we were getting.  So did millions of others.  You know why?  Common sense told us that Michael Bay wasn't trying to make his run for the Oscars with a movie like Transformers.  We knew that there was a high probability that he was coming with the same formula he used in Armageddon, Bad Boys 1 & 2 and Pearl Harbor...and we were okay with that.
  All we wanted was a night of descent entertainment and what we got was a movie that was a blast in every sense of the word.  The well-crafted CGI was phenomenal and will definitely raise the bar for other upcoming movies.  And although the movie didn't carry every conceivable detail of the cartoon series, its premise was close enough to hold a moderately avid fan's attention.  But as I mentioned before, this is Michael Bay's specialty.  And he's getting better with every movie he makes.
  I bought the HD version yesterday, watched it and had just as much fun as I did at the movies.  Not to discredit more Oscar worthy titles, but this type of movie is why I invested a lot of money in a top-notch home theater.  If you can get pass all the biased rhetoric towards Mr. Bay and his movies, then I would definitely recommend this one for a night (and future nights) of great entertainment.",1192579200,5,1878,4.43859649122807

I'm crossing my fingers for a blu ray one...or an extended cut of the film.  Pretty cool movie..I just hope in the next one they add the original music or some how incorporate it in the film..maybe the credits.

1613687,5,B00005JPNO,"This review is on the Transformers (Two-Disk Special Edition) 2007 DVD directed by Michael Bay and starring Shia LaBeouf. The DVD case containing the two disks is packaged in a clear plastic slip case with a seperate insert that you'd normally find on the BACK of a DVD which I've never seen before. I hope I don't accidently throw this insert away! There is no booklet or insert inside the DVD case or anything-just the two disks.
Disk One: This contains the feature film in Widescreen Only no Full-Screen option is given. There is a commentary by Micheal Bay which I found only mildly entertaining. Michael, the typical egocentric Hollywood director, tells some fun stories about the making and filming of the movie but only if he was personally invovled. I found myself wishing Shia could've joined him, he must be too busy filming Indiana Jones right now. Nevertheless, I loved watching this movie again and the 5.1 surround sound option is nice if you must have the effect of robots beating the crap out of each other to sound cool in your living room. This is definitely a popcorn movie!
Disk Two has three way cool featurettes that I really enjoyed watching: Our World, Their War, and More Than Meets the Eye. There's interview snippets of Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, Shia LaBeouf, and other cast members talking about making the movie and clips of how different scenes were shot and rendered all taken from an HBO First Look Featurette Special thing that I'd already watched on YouTube months ago. Peter Cullen (who voices Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving (Megatron) are also shown in the recording studio 'doing their stuff' (Awesome!) and I found the whole process of rendering the CGI robots with the human elements fascinating, those guys really worked hard to make humans interacting with 30"" robots look real on screen. Other ""behind the scenes"" stuff included the transforming of the cars to the big screen, the involvement of the U.S. Military with their weapons and vehicles and the filming in New Mexico and on the military base with comments/interviews from the cast and crew. There are also snippets from the G1 Transformers Episode 1 More Than Meets the Eye cartoon from 1984 that most of us probably remember watching as kids. A visit to Hasbro in Rhode Island taken by Micheal Bay and other crew members is also sprinkled in among the three featurettes. We're also given a short history of the toys from their Japenese conceptions to our Amercian version. To summarize, these three features are just filled with fun behind the scenes info.
Finally on Disk Two there's another feature called Concepts which is just shots of drawings and artwork of Transformers lore with Steve Jablonsky's movie score playing in the background. If you like art or you're just a serious fan of the Transformers universe then this is a special feature you'll enjoy watching.
The three movie trailers including the teaser are also included on Disk Two.
I gave it five stars because I feel if you're a serious fan this DVD satisfies. Unlike the other DVD version (which comes with ZIP!) this special edition at least has a commentary and enough behind the scenes/making of special features to make it worth spending a little extra money on. I recommend purchasing it.",1192492800,2,3270,4.862007168458781
1613688,5,B00005JPNO,"Best movie of 2007 period.  Great for the whole family.  This review is of course for the 2 disc edition.  The dvd cover has Prime on the front and Megatron on the back.  Commentary by the director, trailers and cool, robust special features on the second disc.  If your a fan of the transformers or the uninitiated looking for a good intro to the mythos its certainly worth having.

Why?  Well first of all as far as most movies that evolve from comics or games or cartoons go are usually described as ""origin stories"", most of them are painful to watch.  Sometimes it seems the crew working on the movies cant get through the exposition in a way thats engaging and entertaining.  Michael Bay doesn't have that problem.  He keeps things on the move and in the action.  Some people thought there wasn't much story to this film, but I disagree.  Its a great story, the core of what the transformers has always been about but updated and refreshed for the times we live in.  Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and the rest of the cast do a great job as well.  Instead of paper thin characters the actors give a real sense of emotion.  Another big plus I thought was how Bay gives us a real patriotic and positive look at our military which wherever you come down politically, let it be said that that those people need a lot more respect.  Including actual military personnel in the cast was a nice touch and provided some added authenticity.

The mix of practical and digital effects should act as a blueprint for other film makers.  Bay knows how to use what and where.  The entire production looks top notch and ILM and Digital Domain did a mind blowing great job.  The designs for the transformers were breath taking and the transformations and sound were fantastic.

I understand some people didn't like this and that and make jokes about it being a ""Michael Bay"" film.  Personally I have enjoyed every Michael Bay film Ive seen and don't think anyone could have done a better job here.  And if you really hate the movie then go get some equipment and crew and make your own fan film and etc.

After i got the dvd last night we had movie night at my house and the whole family came over and watched the DVD on the 50 inch DLP.  It is certainly a crowd pleaser.  The image quality and sound quality are simply awesome.  This movie makes me want to upgrade to HD DVD, and I will...",1192492800,,2371,4.415704387990762

1613693,1,B00005JPNO,"Sorry to be so negative here, but this ""movie"", if you can truly call this cg-fueled Splenda fest that, is terrible.  First off, nearly *EVERY* movie based on a comic book/toy line is severely lacking in artistic credibility, because nearly every movie of this type takes liberties with the source material.  And the examples of this are endless.  From liberties taken with the storylines(X-men being the prime example of this. Also, see the newer batman movies, and heck even the last couple of ones made in the 90's), to rampant, pitiful miscastings(once again, the so-called ""x-men franchise"" takes the cake here - I mean c'mon....who in the heck could ever picture Wolverine being some girly-faced Aussie limp wrist?!?!?!?).  So with all that said who in their right mind would make a movie based on an 80 toy line and cartoon?? Answer, some talent-and-originality-impaired IDIOTS that are who.  Sorry, but as a dyed-in-the-wool Transformers fan- or more specifically, of the toy line which was imported here from Japan in '84, all I can say is this movie truly STINKS.  Now don't get me wrong, the storyline does indeed reek (as any ""story"" that attempts to use current events as fodder is lame, to say the least), the storyline never really mattered much to me.  Let's face it, the old 80's cartoon wasn't all that, as far as animated fare went, as it was just a promotional tool to get kids to bug their folks to buy them the toys.  Heck the toys sold themselves, as far as I was concerned.  So to sum up, the storyline of this odious flick is inconsequential.  However my main bone of contention is the way the characters (the Transformers that is) are depicted.  It's bad enough that the characters, who in their original-and dare I say PURER-renditions transformed into a variety of real-world vehicles from a variety of manufacturers-transform only into american-made JUNK in this sad waste of celluloid.  It's even worse that the Transformers, in their robot modes, look far worse than AWFUL - It looks to my eyes, like some chump with an H.R. Giger fetish and a couple hundred thousand boxes of Erector sets designed them -- and threw in some Battlebots and Mad Max elements in there for fun. And the way they move and lumber about, like some Mechwarrior reject, is laughably pathetic.  I also have problems with the way at least one of characters, Bumblebee, to be specific, was portrayed.  I'm sorry, Mr. Bay, that you don't like VW beetles, but that's what Bumblebee TF'd into.  And also, since when in the heck was Bumblebee ever a warrior?!?

You know, maybe, just MAYBE, if the people responsible for this waste of celluloid and CG did the extra legwork, and got the license from the various automakers (Porsche AG, Freightliner, etc, etc) involved in the designs of the original TF characters, and heck even used the ORIGINAL and downright better, timeless designs, then maybe you could've had a winner here.  But as such, all you have is formulaic, CG-driven DRIVEL, ""lovingly crafted"" in the endless factory of mediocrity that is hollywood.  Which will be undoubtedly gobbled down by the clueless masses that are the moviegoers.

Sorry, but due to the fact that Amazon doesn't allow no-star ratings, I give this one star.",1192492800,15,3243,4.842391304347826
1613724,4,B00005JPNO,"It's kind of a cliche now to point out what a bad filmmaker Michael Bay is, not only for his penchant for ideas that just don't work but there's also a sense of arrogance as well (just listen to the commentary for evidence). However he does provide some of the most visceral and action-packed scenes whenever he does something so he's got that going for him. But when he was announced as being the Transformers director, many groaned and in seeing the final movie, I have to admit that yes it does suffer from ""Bay""-isms but then it's also got some of the coolest sequences of 2007 so go figure.

Arriving on Earth are large robots who have the ability to turn into different vehicles and are led by Optimus Prime, leader of the ""Autobots"". They are there searching for the AllSpark which allows them to rebuild their destroyed world of Cybertron but also on Earth are their rivals, the Decepticons who want to use the Allspark to enslave the universe. The key to finding it is a young teenager named Sam Witwicky and his want-to-be-girlfriend Mikaela. They all have to help the Autobots before the Decepticons find it and revive their leader, Megatron.

First, we'll get the new designs out of the way. Sure the original series didn't feel realistic in how a robot can transform into a car but here they look more plausible and have weight to it, like a giant robot can turn into a Camaro or a tank. However, it's also a bit hard to tell them apart and makes them look more ""busy"". However, this also provides the opportunity for ILM to make the effects more sharper (that one trailer moment with Scorponok leaping out of the sand is a slow-motion showcase to be sure) and their by far, some of the best effects I've seen in recent years without any bad compositing problems that plagued films like King Kong. These robots are also in some of the most exciting action scenes so far with favorites being the opening attack by Blackout and Starscream's little tussel with the Air Force.

However, let's face it: this is a Michael Bay movie and you know what that means. Plot doesn't make sense or it's just convenient in places, women are nothing more than hot bodies and speeches are played with overly dramatic music, and the action is a bit too frantic, making it hard to tell who's who. He's getting better and slowing down the editing, sure, but there's way more that he needs to learn. Acting-wise, the only real standouts are Shia Lebeouf who's completely believable in his role and I quite liked Josh Duhamel as soldier Lennox as well. And despite being given laughable lines (""my bad"" anyone?), it's awesome to see Peter Cullen doing Optimus. My one gripe is Hugo Weaving who does Megatron whose voice is processed to be really raspy so I couldn't even tell if it was him.

Sure, it's dumb, plot holes and could use some trimming (not to mention some scenes some massive re-writing) but still, it's some great popcorn action.",1192492800,,2933,4.602294455066922

After all Bumblebee is a hot old and then new Camaro, not a VW Beetle. To me for him to have been a VW Bug in the first place made no sense. Those who did not follow the original cartoons will probably be wowed by the effects and story. It's a matter of perspective. I didn't watch the cartoons in their heyday more than I had to in order to entertain a visiting nephew or some other kid. I was an adult without any kids of my own so although I was familiar with them, I wasn't ""into"" them. Anyone ""into"" them will probably trash this movie. Afterall we all like things the way we first viewed them. So I can certainly respect those ""Transformer"" Fans viewpoint. Since I didn't know the characters, I enjoyed the movie immensely. The acting was as good as I have seen in other movies based on comics and the effects were great.

I liked the original ""Blade Runner"" and I don't appreciate being jumped on because I'm not a fan of the Director's Cut. So although I enjoy this movie, I respect the fans wanting an original version where the transformers are the same as they were originally. Who knows maybe they will come out with a multi-disc special edition with a version that follows the original theme and characeters. For now this was in fact a movie full of action, decent acting, great CGI, and rocking music. I recommend it. The DVD quality was sharp and although this single disc does not include alot of extras, the two-disc set offers a great deal on the Transformer backgound and making of the movie.

1613765,1,B00005JPNO,"I am going to write this review in a different way.  Let's first get this out of the way.  Yes, I was a huge Transformers fan growing up.  Yes, these toys were hitting their peak when I was the perfect target age for them.  And yes, you can attack me immediately for expecting too much from Michael Bay, who has directed such works of art as Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, oh and I forgot Bad Boys II.  I mean, in his defense, I should have known exactly what to expect prior to entering the theater.  In any event, I would like to actually comment on the movie itself, and not even reference the fallacies and utter distortion of the 80s cartoon.  I normally don't have such strong feelings about a movie, but my hatred of this one would allow me to type 15 pages filled with venom and vile comments aimed at Mr. Bay....for the sake of you readers, I will be brief.

Take the robots completely out of the equation here folks, and what are you left with?  A completely, by-the-numbers Hollywood puke fest.  To make this easier on the eyes I will proceed to number each step in making a Hollywood blockbuster according to my friend Bay:

1) Pick an up and coming young actor to play the lead role who was previously successful in other popcorn bucket pukers.  Insert Shia Lacooch here, or Will Smith.  Whoever's not busy that week

2) Find an undiscovered female sidekick that has little impact on the plot but is always scantily clad.

3) Take every sad little opportunity that you can to take pot shots at the government, FBI, and local police departments, because hey, who doesn't hate at least one of those groups in America right?  Insert bad acting government officials, massive conspiracies, utter incompetence, and definitely have one of them use the line ""my ridiculous government salary"" at least once, because all government workers are overpaid and the average Joe hates them people while they spit their tobaccky and cuss.  This sells tickets folks.

4) Continuing with the above premise.  Always make the US military look good.  Americans want to believe in their military and they can not be shown as failing in any movie.  Insert-one marine taking on entire robot force and saving the day here.  Again, let's recap, always make the government, FBI, and police look bad..but...always make the military look good.  Ok?

5)  Now, you must add in a lot of car commercials.  We are not inundated with enough car commercials on a daily basis from television and radio.  No!  We must have them at the movies as well.  I want to see Bumblebee as a Camaro.  And he must be the newest 2008 model.  Who cares that he was actually a Volkswagen Beetle.  Then you must show the teenage boy getting his crush, scantily clad female, into his cool new car and then assuming he will be badda binging her in said car.  Also we must make the cop car a brand new Mustang.  Ford and GMC must be represented well here.  German car companies cannot be represented well (thus the beaten up Beetle in the used car lot).  God bless the USA right folks?

6) And finally, Soundwave.  What have they done to you my precious Soundwave?  They made the once great robot, who stood side by side with Megatron, into a radio/spider/gremlin/annoying little puke.  BUT, he was able to transform into a cellphone, then later a soda machine that sells Pepsi.  Remember, you need the newest cell phone and you must buy Pepsi.  Are we watching the superbowl or a transformers movie?  I forget.

All I can really finish with is this.  Michael Bay's Transformers bares absolutely no resemblance to the original cartoon.  In fact, he didn't even try for a resemblence.  If you choose to overlook the brainwashing techniques thrown into this trash then I weep for you.  I am glad that I still have my childhood memories of the toys and the cartoons to save me from my visions of this film.

I could go on for days and days, but I think I'm going to go buy a Mustang and a Pepsi.  Rock on Michael Bay, you simple-minded blasphemis clown.  Keep laughing your way to the bank to count those millions you keep making off suckers like me and the rest of these shlubs.  God bless GMC and America.

Sam's grandfather glasses, which Sam is selling on eBay, somehow hold the secret and both the Decepticons and Autobots need them to complete their mission of annihilation freedom. The opening hour is fun. Once the plot gets moving and the action scenes start the robots and movie starts to suck and become monotonous.

1613770,1,B00005JPNO,"When someone is talking about a movie or a book and someone says ""I hate it"", I am usually the guy who says something along the lines of ""Hey man, don't waste your energy hating movie that you don't like, just ignore it and move on."" That being said, I HATE this movie.

  When I go into a movie called Transformers I expect it to be about just that. What I don't expect it to be about is Shia LaDouche and his endless parade of two dimensional supporting characters to take center stage at all times and only see the Transformers when the explosions start. Look at the original Transformers: The Movie. There were two humans in it, they had like five lines between them, and even THEY could transform.

  Even the much vaunted action was dominated by the humans. There were no really good robot-on-robot slugfests. Oh sure, there was a blow traded here and there, but it always cut away to one some kind of prolonged reaction shot or different and less cool fight altogether. One example was when Camaro Bumblebee (sellouts) and Evil Prowl were fighting and looking way cool doing it, the action cut away after like five blows so we could watch two teenagers fight with a stereo. After watching every dull awkward second of that lameness we see Bubmlebee approach, battered but victorious. What was apparently a very painful battle between giant robots happened OFFSCREEN. Later, Optimus Prime and Megatron called eachother out on the battlefield and flew into the epic battle we've been waiting twenty years for and it once again cut to the same freaking teenagers fighting the same freaking stereo!

  Those are my main beefs, a couple other things I hated (I literally have nothing good to say about this cinematic upchuck) were the constant, goofy, quippy chunks of ""humor"" and the ever-present product placement. There was a ten minute long scene where the main character has an awkward masturbation related conversation with his moron parents while the Autobots bumble aimlessly and incompetently around his backyard while  Prime says things like ""My bad"". As for the other thing, there were a transforming Nokia cellphone and transforming Mountain Dew machine, enough said.

  What I really hate is that as a true Transformers fan I will never escape this. I will go to Bot Con and it will be dominated by posters and booths and possibly Michael Bay himself signed copies of the ""GM sponsored Super Special Edition"". I will talk with my nerd friends about the show and people will chime in with ""Are you talking about Transformers? I love that movie!"" All in all I can sum up my thoughts like this: If at some pont in the future I get kicked in the balls, I can now smile to myself and say ""Oh well, at least I'm not watching Transformers.""",1192233600,13,2748,4.7

The only thing it does aspire to be is a adrenaline pumping, humerous, wild, and out of control blockbuster of a film and it does to great extent. I'm not such a big fan of Micheal Bay but i have to say that is has to be his best film so far.
The plot is simple enough, a young teen named Sam Whitwickey (the rising star of Shia Lebouf) stumbles upon a civil war taking place on Earth, the fight between two large extraterestrials called 'Transformers'. On one side you got the Autobots (good guys) and then you have the Decepticon's (the bad guys) fighting to find an artifact of immense power. What follows is basically a two hour movie of explosions, quick humor, flashy effects, and some serious car chases.
First off, i have seen some impresive effects work, but this is by far some of the best i have ever seen. I don't know how they did it but everything just seems so real, its almost unatural. Not since The Lord of the Rings have i been so blown away by such effects.
The actors also have fun in there film roles, Lebouf being the shinning star, Meagan Fox in the sexpot role, Josh and Tyrese as the army guys, and every one else all just having a blast. And besides, we all know that the robots are the real stars of the show and even they make fine use of there roles (even if they are just computered animated).
So for those of you looking for something thought provoking, this is definently not the movie for you. But for the rest of us, just sit back and relax and watch all the pretty effects fly.",1192233600,4,1652,4.298076923076923

One of the most successful animated series every it was only a matter of time and patiences that The Transfomers would grace live action cinema. This movie was one of the biggest attractions for 2007 with many mixed feelings no one knew what to expect. Especially since Michael Bay was directing. Still having a Steven Speilberg producing and Michael Bay being known as the king of car chase you just had to keep an open mind or just see it for the sake of seeing it even if it ended up being terrible.

This movie was probably one of the most overhyped since Indepence Day and when I finally got to see it, I was blown away by how awesome it was. The characters were very true to the original series. Shia LeBouf did a great job as Sam 'Spike' Witwicky. John Voit, John Touturo and all the others were great. There were a few changes that many of the loyal fans were able to find right away, but as long as Peter Cullen was doing the voice for Optimus Prime the errors weren't so bad. What made this movie so great for me was it made me feel like a kid again sitting in the theater with so many people in my age range it was one of the best experiences I ever had.

1613804,1,B00005JPNO,"What a monumental failure, I truly can't understand how any being can get enjoyment out of this movie. Look at everything that's wrong with it:

--It's tries waaay too hard to be ""cool,"" hip, and current to our culture. It ends up mocking itself and fails miserably. There's never ANY sense of danger or drama at all, it's all just a happy, cheerful display of moving machines.

--It made me sick to my stomach how literally 30 seconds could NOT go by without some character in the movie making some lame, childish joke. I'm not exaggerating, 60 consecutive seconds could not go by without something moronic happening. It really bothers me that some dude made the conscious decision to have this movie be riddled with stupid, idiotic, 'teen' humor.

--Did it bother anyone else at how relatively easy it was for the humans to capture and restrain the Transformers?

--I hated the sense that the first half of the movie was the ""story,"" and the second half was just like, ""ok, now time for the action.""

--Has the typical useless girl character who ends up being completely insignificant in the final parts of the movie, yet they spent so much time on her in the first half. Why not give her something good to do at the end? Then again I guess it's better to have her do nothing, than give her a clichd role of coming up behind some bad guy and saving the hero or something similar. And speaking of her, as usual, the movie makers obviously only care about appearance, since that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look.

--I'll say one positive thing for once, the main character, who I also liked in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disturbia/dp/B000RO6K9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disturbia</a>, has good energy to him and seems to have a knack for comedic timing. He was the only thing in the movie that didn't sicken me.

The opening scenes are full of subtle racism (""hey generic latino guy, SPEAK ENGLISH!""). All the robots looked exactly the same. There was barely any action, and when there was it was lame. Is it that hard to make a good action movie anymore? Remember Robocop? Remember Aliens? Did those movies have anything that can compare to the mindblowingly unfunny 30-minute giant-robots-are-hiding-in-my-backyard scene in this piece of garbage?
This movie is a joke. It's a 2 1/2 hour commercial for Hasbro and GM. Anything good you could get out of it could be taken from the 30-second clip of one of the robots transforming that people were posting up online before the movie came out. The fact that Michael Bay could churn out yet another waste of life like it means he considers the movie going masses a bunch of brainless idiots who will fork over their dollars for a few glimpses of CGI explosions.

1613811,3,B00005JPNO,"It is almost a trademark for Michael Bay to make his films with very little substance, moronic dialogue, flashy cinematography with over the top special effects and explosions. His resume is full of terrible films. Unfortunately, this is not an exception. No matter how much we wanted for this movie to be a success--you know, to bring those cool memories from the 80s--it is a Michael Bay film after all and he disappoint us once again with his new Movie Transformers, based on the beloved TV cartoons about a war on earth between two clans of alien robots. I said it before and I'll say it again, if there is a weak plot with very little character development, the ""over the top"" multimillion-dollar special effects will do very little to create cinematic momentum. This new adaptation is too long, loud, and extravagant and fast-paced at the same time.

Brief Introduction Story:
The Decepticons are now on earth and conduct an attack to a US military base in Qatar. They want to hack into our military network--apparently; they are looking for something important. A group of soldiers survive the attack, but they're being chased a scorpion-like Deception. The US military finally get to destroy the alien.

Back in the States, teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is selling old belongings from his great-great-grandfather using e-Bay. He is unpopular with the girls, so he is raising money to buy a car, and he does, an old yellow Camaro that is. Also Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight) is going crazy trying to find out who is attacking us and gathers the best hackers to find out who is creating all these problems, but without success. They are going to find out that we humans are in a middle of a war between robots from another planet. The Autobots (good guys) finally reveal themselves to Sam--actually his old car is one of them--and explains him that his great-great-grandfather's glasses have the key to find the cube--an alien item that they need to protect from the Decepticons. Meanwhile, the evil robots are also looking for Sam (to get the cube) and getting ready for battle. Their leader Megatron has been in a hibernating state for decades in a military base hidden under a dam, but they will try to wake him up to go to war against the Autobots. Does humanity stand a chance against these aliens?

Review:
What happened to the character development of our alien robots? We did not learn much from them. Even in the original cartoon, these cool robots had more personality and charm. For example, in this film, Optimums Prime--the one Bay should have focused on--is reduced to an average robot that gives cheesy speeches left and right. At least Prime is better as a leader than Jon Voight who was very unconvincing as the Secretary of Defense. Also, there is very little relationship between Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and his car/protector Autobot Bumblebee. Remember the strong ties between young John Connor and the Terminator? I was expecting something like this, and then I remembered, ""Oh it is Michael Bay, sorry never mind."" Not only those important aspects are missing, Bay also gives us lame dialogue, sexual jokes and innuendos and annoying subplots. These are the elements that slow things down, and get in the way of the action which is the main reason why people come to see Transformers.

Everybody wants to know how great those computer graphics are, and for the most part, it won't disappoint. Yes, the polygon-extravaganza is one of the best features of Transformers. There is a sense of realism, especially in the final battle. But Michael Bay's fast-paced camerawork makes the battles between these giants difficult to follow. Sometimes I couldn't tell the Autobots from the Decepticons--they all kind of blend with each other. In other words, the CGI looks great, but Bay's hyperactive cinematography--very ""Armageddoness""--ruins most of the fun.

The Verdict:
What was Steven Spielberg thinking? Why did he decide to work with Michel Bay? As the Executive Producer, he should have encouraged Bay to give more depth to the characters, make the action sequences ""less Bay"" and get rid of unnecessary subplots. The computer department did an excellent job--those robots look pretty real--but with a director whose record speaks for itself, those cool graphics go out the window. In reality, Transformers really looks like an extended version of its trailer, with plenty of eye candy, but no soul.",1191888000,,4442,4.949061662198392

It doesn't hold a candle to the new release. I went to see it with my two teenaged daughters and all of us sat there big eyed and spellbound for the entire movie. Frankly, I never knew my kids could sit still that long. In my wildest dreams I never thought I would hear Optimus Prime say, ""My bad!""

A good story, great action scenes (which Michael Bay is excellent at) and top notch movie effects.  Yes, it had the visual effects and some brilliant action scenes.  But very little else.  What a disappointment.  The whole parent interrogation scene and robots in the garden was utterly ridiculous.  So bad I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie.  And 3 hours long - there was at least 1 hour of TOTAL NONSENSE.

Michael Bay you absolutely butchered it.  This film is an insult to our intelligence.  Please...please....do not purchase this DVD....you will be disappointed.

And I hear Mr. Bay is already contracted for TRANSFORMERS 2 in 2009-2010!  Looks like no end to the misery......",1191715200,11,856,4.820689655172414

I didn't know Michael Bay from a hole in the ground but when I read about him I was concerned with his taking on Transformers.  My fears were mostly unfounded.  The movie is a cinematic masterpiece.  However, I have to say that a lot of the action sequences were VERY hard for me to follow.

I also disagree with the person who said the musical score was dull or droll.  I thought it was FANTASTIC.  In fact, the song ""Arrival To Earth"" which is played, appropriately enough, when the Autobots first arrive here, is PERFECT and for me completely makes the scene.  I was one of the thousands of fans who signed the petition to get Steve Jablonsky's score released and I'm so glad it will be as well!!

I knew little of Shia LeBouf and nothing of Megan Fox before this movie.  Shia plays Sam Whitwicky DEAD ON.  Megan, while a very beautiful lady, was to me just filler.  Same goes for the whole Sector 7 scene, the group of computer geniuses and a few other characters who were thrown in.

It's called Transformers for a reason - and this is the reason I went to see the movie in the first place (saw it a total of six times in the theater!).  My #1 fave has always been Optimus Prime - and I feel no shame in saying that I list him as someone I consider a hero and someone who I apire to be like.  I am VERY, VERY grateful that someone had the brains to bring Peter Cullen on board to do the voice.  While the talented Gary Chalk has actually voiced Optimus characters longer, to me Peter just IS Optimus Prime.  Noble, Loyal, Paternal almost.  To be brutally honest, I don't think I would've gone to see the movie if Peter hadn't been Prime.  He means that much to me.

Unfortunately, the good sense didn't continue in the voice casting of Megatron.  Hugo Weaving is a great actor - and even does voice work well I'm sure.  BUT NOT AS MEGATRON.  That honor, like Optimus, should have gone to voice master Frank Welker.  And I feel shafted not hearing Mr. Welker's gravel voice coming out of Meg's mouth.

Long winded review - hey I'm entitled every now and again.  *LOL*  Definitely worth owning the movie.  A definite blockbuster that will forever stand the test of time.",1191715200,4,2440,4.355555555555555

The movie took me back because all of the voiceover's where the original's and that blew me away alone, but to see these robot's transform is absolutey breath taking. The movie stay's true to the cartoon but dumbed down a little for the younger generation(business move)but still highly entertain's all age's. I think part two will be more story  based but remember it's a business and there will alway's be a kid market but if they can balance it and hit all market's as far as children ,men , woman, races then you dethrone TITANIC. I will (bee)the first in line to see Transformer's 2 and I know they will introduce the other Transformer's that was missing. I will not tell you anything about the movie I,m from the old school REMEMBER, we think for ourselve's and want to see for ourselve's. PEACE and enjoy.",1191369600,3,1667,4.748275862068965

See this movie for what it is; it's just a great amusement park ride of fun. Plain and simple. If you want real stimulation read some classical literature, then when you need a mindless break; watch this on the Plasma and you may actually smile for once in your life.

When I saw this movie I had a smile ear to ear because it was simple and visually stunning like Jurrasic park was the first time.

From beginning to end this movie delivers nothing but heart pounding action that all but the old and senile will get into. This movie isn't perfect, the plot is far fetched, the military characters weren't portrayed realistically, and the odds of some nerdy kid ending up with the most beautiful girl I've ever seen are slim, even after saving her life. That said, WHO CARES!!!!! Really, you don't go to see a movie like Transformers for realism, you go to see giant robots beat the snot out of each other, and that's exactly what you get. The one thing I really loved about this movie though was that the Transformers could be killed by us petty humans. They weren't unstoppable, so it made it more interesting when we deployed the F-22's to fight back.

Overall there is really no way for you not to like this movie. I don't know anyone who doesn't love it. This is action packed fun that anyone can enjoy, so just sit back, relax, and turn off your mind for about 2 hours of giant robot fun.

1613906,2,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" may be the most audience dividing movie I've seen this year. It has as many things going for it as it does against it, and debating the pros and cons of the film could make any sane person feel the need to find a new hobby. On one hand the movie comes from director Michael Bay (""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor ""), who delivers the kind of film you'd except him to deliver: A film that is noisy, loud, and an assault on the senses. Like most Bay movies though, this one is also a lot of fun, no matter how brainless it might be. On the other hand it's a movie based off a TV series that was designed to sell toys, which means this movie contains an onslaught of product placement from Chevrolet cars, to eBay plugs, to a Mountain Dew machine that turns into a robot. What you think I'm making all this up?

Take these two things and bundle them in a $200 million dollar budget, and you've got not really a movie but a glorified commercial. But man, just like those Jack In The Box commercials this commercial is quite entertaining at times. The story for this movie doesn't really matter that much in the long run, but it revolves around a teenage boy named Sam (""Even Steven's"" Shia LaBeouf) attempting to raise money to buy a car for himself (something that is every teens dream), a situation that is at the point of desperation thst Sam has turned to selling his grandpa's glasses on eBay to earn money. Needless to say he DOES raise the money, gets the car, and uses it to try and woo local pretty girl Mikaela Banes, who turns out to be a quite a useful car mechanic.

What Sam doesn't know is that robots from another planet (known as Decepticons) have landed on Earth, and they are looking for an item known only as ""The Cube,"" which they intend to use to turn anything mechanical into a robot. No, I'm not making that up either. What the Decepticons don't know is that their mortal enemies, the Cybertron's, are looking for the Cube as well, though they want to destroy it without harming the humans. The first Cybertron we meet is Bumblebee, who is hiding as Sam's yellow Camaro. Bumblebee can't speak, but he uses his radio frequency to communicate, a gimmick that works better then you might think it would. When Sam finally meets the leader of the Cybertron's, Optimus Prime, he learns that the key to the Cube's location is actually imprinted in the glasses of Sam's grandfather. No, I am totally NOT making that up!

All this is just smoke and mirrors though, as the real star of the movies are all the explosions, battle sequences, and those cool looking robots themselves. The movie opens with a Decepticon attacking a military base in the Qatar dessert. Then there are several car chases while a Decepticon chases Sam and Bumblebee through the town. When the rest of the Cybertron's make their appearance, a showdown that clocks in at almost a full hour takes place as the Cybertron's help the military fight off the Decepticons and their leader Megatron. Showing more interest in quick cut action scenes then in any character development, ""Transformers"" is a lot of fun but really shallow, to the point where I was very conflicted about my enjoyment of the film, and passed on writing a review the first time around.

A second viewing at the IMAX gave me a clearer vision of the film though. On the IMAX there is one thing that is very apparent: This is one very good looking film. The screen is so big, you can see the tiniest detail in the cars when they transform into their robot forms. The screen is so big in fact, you can actually appreciate the fact that the robots surroundings are actually reflected in the chrome on their bodies. And for the most part, the robots actually look like they are in the world they are in, instead of being computer images that live on a different layer then that of the actors. In this film, the actors actually interact with the robots very well, and it doesn't look artificial for the most part. The problem is I didn't really enjoy the story as much the second time around.

Despite the fact that the IMAX makes the movie so involving that you feel like you're getting motion sickness, the movie just sort of jumps from here to there looking pretty, without ever truly involving you in the story. The characters are all stereotypical and the storyline is so silly you constantly have the knowledge in the back of your head that this is a glorified toy commercial. Yet I can't completely damn the film either, because the movie IS very entertaining at times! I just can't help but wonder what will happen when I watch this movie on DVD. While I can't be completely sure now, I have a feeling I'll find myself bored with the film. In the right environment this can be a very fun film to watch, but taken out of an environment that provides an experience fit for an event the movie will seem very dull. So if you see it, see it in theaters (or, better yet, IMAX). Just see it on a theater screen of some sort, as I fear a TV screen will take away lots of entertainment this film has to offer.

Rating: ** and a half stars",1191024000,9,5090,4.456008583690987
1613907,1,B00005JPNO,"I remember the old cartoon as a good mix between action and good story. The first three episodes (""the Pilot"" if someone wanna call them), talk in a very clever way the civil war in cybertron and why the robots change in certain things.
At the beginning when I read and I watch  the trailers of these movies I thought ""there must be a good reason of why they change so much the chracters and use other ones instead the classics"".
But after 30 minutes watching this ""spawn"" I found there's no single good reason for any change.
The appearance of the robots has no real scientific justification and even the story of the ""cube"" it's full of mistakes (why when they use the cube the machines become evil?).
I don't know but the story it's so silly, so much action for nothing, the robots are just pieces of junk with some magnetic union because If you remember the cartoon, optimus and every character, had some specific way to transform so you can recognice the arms or legs of the robots as some part of the vehicle, but everything acts like magic, they can change their appearance at will (so why they don't use a better one, in the cartoon was the computer of the spaceship who choose the better thing at the time it reconstruct the robots).
After this movie I'm done with Michael Bay, I don't wanna watch or hear anything about this guy who only knows how to spend money without using the brain, he could do a better movie with less budget a very clever story and characters only if, he at least, study the cartoon or even the original comics (which, by the way are better than this pieces of trash)",1190851200,8,1601,4.408783783783784

This movie was so incredibly good that I saw it 4 times in the theater, and I never got bored with it. The effects are superb, the story is interesting, and the action will leave you breathless. So, is it worth seeing, and,or purchasing? You bet.",1190678400,5,440,4.378048780487805
1613909,3,B00005JPNO,"When I heard that a ""Transformers"" film was in the works, I became excited.  ""Yes, yes, yes! This is gonna rule!""

When I heard who was directing it. ""Oh.""

I have yet to see a Michael Bay movie that wasn't exciting (except maybe Pearl Harbor). This guy knows how to blow the socks off of his audience in terms of action sequences, and Transformers certainly did that, without a doubt. It's fair to say that Michael Bay is one of the best action film directors there is. It's also fair to say that he one of the worst storytellers in Hollywood.

He butchered the Transformers, at least as I remember them growing up, but that wasn't a letdown. I heard the director's name and I saw it coming. Therefore I am able to give this movie three stars. The story was ridiculous, but the kid in the main role did okay, and the chick was hot and the action was SICK!! And THAT'S why I pay to see Michael Bay's films. The plot just moves the ""story"" from A to B and finally to Z and is nothing special-- never is when Bay is involved. But I knew I'd love the action. He never fails me there. So, the movie only sucked a little.

One purist complaint I have (and I can complain for hours about how this wasn't like the Transformers of my youth) isn't that Bumblebee was a Chevy Camaro instead of a VW Bug (we have VW to thank for that). That upset plenty of old-school fans of the toys and animated series. My biggest problem is that while the Autobots as characters were fleshed out about as well as Michael Bay knows how to flesh out characters in his films, the Decepticons had zero personality and not enough screen time in my opinion. They were just evil, cold, machines that had little to say to each other, and just went on a destructive rampage.

C'mon man! Where's the rivalry between Megatron and Starscream? Where is all the wisecracking and taunting between them and the Autobots? Why don't we see as much of the Decepticons? They were equal parts in the series. That, to me, was the biggest disappointment, never mind the flimsy storytelling which I was prepared for going in.

I won't say its better, but I highly recommend the 1986 Animated Transformers movie. As action goes it can't compete with Michael Bay, but it's classic Tranformers.

I can go on, but there are other, better, longer reviews that do it for me, so I'll wrap this up and say that, yeah, it's a good movie, a bad story, but still a damn fine piece of action, and I will buy this on dvd. I'm still up in the air over whether I'll get it in HD or not. I wish they'd put this on a HD DVD Combo Disc like ""300"" did. I'm just not sure that this movie is worth the extra expense of buying it on HD, but for action fans this movie truly delivers action.

But yes, i will admit the movie is sometimes to much action happening too fast for someone to gather it all, but that would not be a problem with a smaller screen, not some movie theater sized screen. But anywho, the movie itself is well done, some stupid homour, but cool, almost believable storyline, great action, and of course, a love story thrown in to appeal to the ladies.

Gotta hide 'em from the parents!  The actors do fine with this but WAS THIS KIND OF MOVIE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON THE ACTING?!

The opening scene was fantastic... the overt attack definitely made me think it was going to have more of an apocalyptic - T2 feel.  But it slows down tremendously from there; in fact most of the Transformers don't come in until the last quarter of the movie.  And the fight scenes are very close cut, with a wildly moving camera; don't expect to know who's who.  That's not the point.  Hey, building are beings destroyed, man!  Michael Bay's over-the-top manner quickly grates as much as Megatron's one-liners (think Mr. Freeze in Batman + Robin)...

1613965,4,B00005JPNO,"I was hesitant to see this movie but the trailer really won me over because of the whole cheesy look to it. Man, was I proven wrong. I thought the movie was a lot of fun-- the nonstop action, the storyline, and the appearance of the coolest robots ever in existence.

The robots, the just Autobots and the power-hungry Decepticons, are given a brief prologue and summary of their ramshackle home planet and the war that's waging between the two sides, but we never actually see anything until the near end of the movie. The human characters also aren't very fleshed-out and there are some of the usual archetypes you find in an action flick: the hero who wants to return to his family because he has a child, the government official who doesn't know the entire truth behind what's going in, the nerd who still lives with his grandma, and the teenage boy who's pining for the pretty girl who doesn't even know he's alive. But since this is a Michael Bay flick and some of these archetypes are in his previous films (Armageddon, anyone?), I think Bay's fans wouldn't really care; Shia LeBeouf, however, gives a pretty decent performance as aforementioned teen who likes the hot chick. If more attention had been focused on the robots, who are the real stars of the show, it would have been a greater movie, but since I had so much fun watching it four times in the theater, I think all can be forgiven.

I have seen this movie four times, and each time is like the first time; INCREDIBLE, EXCITING AND NEW. And if it was still playing at the movies in my area, I would PAY to see it again and again. It is just that good. This movie, along with Bourne Ultimatum are the movies to see. I will tell you why I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. The cybernetic organisms came across as real beings and all the humans involved were not a side issue. They were not stereotypical nor over the top. The screenplay and direction worked hand-in-hand to make sure that they were in harmony with each other. (You can credit Steven Spielberg with that.) The scenes were appropriate, with many of them being actually very funny. I and many others actually laughed hard at the genuinely funny lines and situations. All this and more was the magic of the cartoon Transformers, and the animated feature (1986), and I hope with the sequel (hint at the ending credits) that it will be even more loyal. With the Transformers, there are many stories to tell, but they must be told WELL, something even the cartoon sometimes failed to do, at times. This movie told a larger-than-life tale EXTREMELY well.

There was only two cheesy moments (ie Megan Fox) and my only two disappointments are that Sam should have been SPIKE, his father is SPARKPLUG and Spike's girlfriend should have been CARLY.

Anyway, I have put in my pre-order for the actual score and the HD DVD two-disc version. I bought the helmet with the voice changer from Hasbro toy, bought the pre-movie novel and the movie novel (which wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as it could have been.) and have a guide or two. (Did I mention I love the Transformers? NO? Oh, by the way, I love the Transformers.)

A personal note to Shia: You were wonderful. It is because of your acting in Transformers that I went out and bought Disturbia. I saw you in the Greatest Game. I didn't recognize you; my how you've grown. Good acting there, too. First class job! If they do an animated series, would you please consider doing the voice for Sam?

There is so much wrong with this film its hard to know where to begin, but my guess is you would have to startw ith Muchale Bay. he should really just be a 2nd unit director who just does the action sequences.

I grew up watching and playing with transformers but did not commit to memory every detail of every character. That said, there are obvious discrepencies with the storyline (for more information, read the 1 star reviews). Keep in mind the rating of this film, though, and remember that this movie was created with today's teenagers in mind.  We children of the 80's are no longer teenagers and our nostalgia for the greatness of the original transformers is not the governing power in the screenplay.  However, with movies turned out by the dozens with cheap effects, bad acting, bad writing, and gratuitious sex and nudity, I wanted to see what Transformers could offer the big screen. I was very pleasantly surprised.  The CG was amazing and the writing thoughtful and original.  For pure entertainment purposes this is a true winner for anyone who can enjoy an old story with a new twist.",1189382400,,995,4.863905325443787

transformers has made it big into therters it has made a Domestic Total of $311,389,000 and
harry potter order of the phoenix Domestic Total $288,240,000 so i for one liked transformers more than harry potter and all the other summer film either transformers made more or less money at the boxoffice or not i realy like how prime has got an upgradeed look to his vehicle mode as well gives him attitude once i saw his truck mode hit the net i liked it from the start i had no problems with the flames or any of the other bots once ive seen them in action on the big screen.

this film was alot of fun for me i saw this 5 times allready and plan on seeing it again as for the dvd release i expected more where are the bloopers, dleted scenes, the that prequel scene i heard one of theactors talk about in the interview to show in movie format how bumblebee got his voice box damaged in battle on planet cybertron wheres that scene none of those are included on the dvds what so ever ill be getting teh set but i will alos be waiting for another and version of the dvd release to be out with pleanty of more speacial features along the way.?

dvd cases are ok looking not that impressed with it like the single disc version cover more than the 2 disc version to compare dvd with hddvd to me i don't see a big differnce between the 2 dvds hddvd has brighter picture thats the only thing that stands out for me in the hddvd but the sound in hddvd i cant tell the differnce between the original dvd and the hddvd both dvds sond the same to me when i compare the sound, music, and the explsions and for hddvd ,bluray dvds the menus are nice but the dvds feels like im buying a game  and not a movie some bonus matrial with hd and bluray only avaliable online to download feels like i own and xbox360 or the Wii play the game get extra boards, characters by downloading off the net and spending game pionts i don't want to watch a movie with little windows popping up every where with the making of this scene, comentary on that scene while im watching the film itself feels like im on the net watching a movie with popups every where.

for the sequel i cant wait for don't what bay has wants to do for the sequel but if megatron does comback somehow he should be named galvatron i really like how ilm created the robots and the transformations as well ginat robots that looked the animated series woulld be boring the the robots look in this version of transformers robots look more realistic and menacing looking.

if i didn't say it before ill be very pleased if they release another version of this to dvd with much more features extended scenes, bloopers, maybe prequel scene with bumblee on planet cubertron if that was true, bios, a little idea what to expect in the sequel maybe if possible.",1189382400,2,3081,4.249146757679181

Michael Bay proves once again that while he can direct things going kaboom, he has no grip on anything that has a historical backing or years of mythos that could be followed. Almost everything that ever was Transformers was ignored so that a movie about a kid (based as loosely as possible on Spike Witwicky, the human component from the original series) buying a car and thrust into the forefront of a poorly re-imagined war between pretty laughable excuses for the Autobots and Deceptacons. I say forefront because throughout the movie, Sam proves himself to be the real hero of this story, which is pretty sad. With the exception of one heroic speech by Optimus Prime, a speech kicked off with the ""Make Optimus Speak"" contest winning line that should have been a given in a Transformers movie, each of the Transformers are shells of their original characters with bare minimum character development and nothing of the source material in any of its forms.
The human characters are equally shallow, from Sam's over the top parents to the super-stereotypical super-cop and the smarmy G-man who knows everything about everything and has the ego to back it up. And the computer super-hacker and Bernie Mac's shady car dealer are so stereotyped that their characterizations probably made Don Imus say ""That's a little inappropriate."" But remember, if you just want to sit back and watch things explode and support the horror that is becoming American Cinema, by all means, buy away.",1189296000,11,1757,4.899328859060403

I have to think REALLY hard what movie provided me with so much in the fact fun and action. For example, it simply can't compare to any other recent movie like Spiderman or even Pirates of the Caribbean.

The technology has advanced so much in visual effects that you absolutely believe that all you are seeing is real.

Trust me, this movie simply deserves to be watched in hi-def and HD DVD is a perfect format. I can't even begin to express my excitement with the additional interactive features and online content available only on HD DVD version.

1614063,4,B00005JPNO,"i was so excited to see Transformers when it came out in July. I didn't like the fact that it was directed by Michael Bay, because we all know what a fast action shot and slow motion and close up pulling trigger on a gun type of director he is. (case in point Bad Boys 2, which was a bit too violent.) Anyway the movie was good definitely at the beginning with Shia LeBouf, Bumblebee (who is now my favorite transformer for his musical expressive nature), and Mikeala. But the story moved way too quick , at least the part getting up to Megatron and the decepticons. The action was way fast and sometimes it was like a blur of imagery with loud machinery noise. And the end too quick, how in the world can Megatron reach his demise so freaking quickly and how in the world would Optimus Prime let his butt get kicked by Megatron. I don't think Bay really researched enough on Transformers concerning the fight scenes. It ended too quick, I mean most of the time the villain lives another day to ensure a sequel and the closing end to the trilogy. You think they would have kept Megatron alive so Bay could direct 2 more movies and cash in. Guess not? Anyway I still enjoyed it. It was funny, action packed, and awesome.

1614065,4,B00005JPNO,"I remember seeing the teaser trailer for ""Transformers"" when it first came out.  We were reminded of the 2003 Mars Beagle 2 Lander that was lost when it arrived on the surface of the red planet and told that there actually was a brief transmission.  The lander started rolling across the surface of the planet only to have something menacing approach it and suddenly end the transmission.  I was thinking this was pretty kewl: we find out there is other life in our solar system and they come to get us, ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Worlds/dp/B00005JNTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Worlds)</a>.  Then it turned out that those things heading for Earth were Transformers and I laughed out loud in disbelief.  Transformers?  Who wants to go see a movie about a bunch of toys from twenty years ago?  Well, apparently a whole lot of people since the movie broke the Fourth of July record set by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B00005JMQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>.""  Therefore I decided this could be a fun way to spend an afternoon at the movies.

It will not surprise you to learn that I am not part of the generation that played with Transformers and who were addicted to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/cartoon-series/dp/B000063K17/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">cartoon series</a>.  No, I belonged to the generation that bought Transformers for their children, although I remember mainly buying Dinobots, because I like dinosaurs.  I got up early one morning to get to a toy store when it opened to make sure I got the complete set for my son for Christmas when he was very little and got up one morning to discover that he had somehow figured out which four presents had the Dinobots and had opened them.  Anyhow, I remembered that Megatron was the leader of the bad Transformers who could turn into a jet and that Optimus Prime was the leader of the good Transformers and he was a semi-truck.  I recognized the whole Decepticons and Autobots once they came up into the movie, but if you gave me a quiz on which one is Bonecrusher or what Ironhide turns into I would be lost.  Bumblebee I got, but that was pretty much because he is the third major Transformer in the movie and the hero says his name several times to aid in retention.

In Qatar a military base is attacked by a Decepticon helicopter in an attempt to hack the military computer and gain access to important information to find out information about something called Project Iceman and the location of the cube known as the Allspark.  Most of the troops are wiped out, but Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are part of a team that escapes and we figure they will have an important role to play.  Then there is high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who learns that it is true, the car selects the drive, when he ends up with a shabby yellow Camaro with the Transformer symbol in the center of the steering wheel.  Sam is interested in Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), who is clearly too cool for him, but circumstances will put them together when the action starts.  Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) is in charge of figuring out what is going on and then doing something about it once the truth is revealed, because who ever is President is only interested in Ding-Dongs (a curious example of product placement in this overlong pre-election year).  Fortunately the military turns to young computer experts like Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) who turns to a hacker like Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson) to help figure out that these things, whatever they might be, are not made in Japan...

I liked the serious stuff more than the comic stuff in ""Transformers,"" and director Michael Bay avoids the problems of trying to walk such a fine line by doing each on its own terms.  All things considered, I am surprised that the serious parts get so serious, because the ultimate goal here is to have fun, which is why you see very few dead bodies despite all the carnage.  They put so much detail into these Transformers that the best visual effects in the movie are not the fight sequences but when Optimus Prime is just talking to Sam and you can see all the parts of the semi-truck (I hope kids are not disappointed when they get their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optimus-Prime/dp/B000M6F3U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optimus Prime</a>&nbsp;movie tie-in toy or any of the other Transformers and discover that the robots do not have three times the mass of the semi-truck cab, car, or whatever they transform from).  The fight sequences are pretty much blurs so you always get an impression of what is happening rather than a clear idea of what is really going on.  So there are very few memorable moments in these fights.  The best would have to be Megatron dragging Optimus Prime through an office building, although overall I liked the fights in Qatar better than the ones in Los Angeles.  ""Transformers"" runs a bit long (specifically the set up because we have to wait a long time for that Camaro to transform), but it is still a solid but not spectacular popcorn movie, just what you need on a holiday afternoon (even if it is Labor Day instead of the Fourth of July).",1188777600,2,5415,5.089265536723164

Brief blurb on the format war and the decision for this to not be a Blu-Ray release:

Sony/Blu-Ray fanboys can sure be both sore winners and sore losers.  I agree that exclusivity is retarded and Warner's TotalHD would be a great solution, but I hate how Blu-Ray fanboys can look the other way when Sony buys off studios and it benefits them but the second that the HD DVD camp does it you get all whiny. (if Blu-Ray supporters were republican and HD DVD supporters were Democrats... *grin*)  Did anyone stop and think that Paramount (despite the rumors about $100 million to Paramount and $50 million to Dreamworks, regardless of whether or not it was a buyout or merely an additional incentive) might actually like the cheaper production cost of HD DVD (HD DVD is able to use existing DVD clearing houses and needs minimal additional equipment to produce whereas there are currently only 3 clearing houses capable of making Blu-Ray discs) and the consumer-friendly nature of the cheaper players (that were RELEASED with all promised hardware features, not promises that they'll be added soon)

Seriously, I got sick of waiting for a winner in the format war, but despite Blu-Ray being in the lead (at the time) I chose HD DVD because the price finally got down to where I felt I could afford it and even write it off if HD DVD lost.  Sony makes good products, but Blu-Ray is a good format for companies that want to limit consumer's choices (with features like region coding, a relic of the DVD-Divx wars).

The solution in the format war is, always, a compromise format or the ability to play both.  Here's some good examples:

56k modems
k.flex protocol (Lucent chipset) vs. X2 protocol (Texas Instrument chipset).  Solution: v. 90 protocol

if Bay made a bionacle/gobot/power rangers movie it would be excactly the same as this movie: a boy looking for sex a girl in heat a giant commercial for the millitary,playboy,general motors,xbox,other Bay movies and toys with  giant fighting dead zombie looking robots in the final 20 min

this is why source material is so important it forces film makers to stay original within a set universe or make an original robot movie and call it ''giant robots''

if a Batman movie ignores its source material the movie would be just about a guy in a holloween costume why not change the batsuit into an police uniform? makes more sense BUT he won't be Batman anymore

that is what Bay did to the transformers

this movie is only for non-transformers fans or transformers fans that can accept enything with 'transformers' on the box

why 2 stars?
+Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime
+great cgi
+ G1 transformation sound
-robots look dead
-90% is about humans
-not the G1 show/comic books storyline not even as back story (no Ark/energon/awakening on earth)
-poor music,not even an hint of the G1 score
-Megatron is a typical hollywood monster
-sex 'jokes'
-[...] 'joke'
-cant see the dead zombie robots because of bad camera work
-if the writers were fans of G1 they would now that vector sigma had the same function as this allspark-cube but was a orb
 -the transformers look chould have stayed atleast 50% to the G1 designs (update them for a live action movie fine but this has nothing to do with the transformers)
 -and the list gos on....

also when the hype is over the movie wil in a few years time be voted the worst movie ever made....just like Titanic
now its 'cool' to love this movie 'but when the cgi gets older only a poor movie remains Star wars ages gracefully because of great effects AND story....

cgi only works when the movie is new it is just a tool....",1187481600,4,1991,4.686781609195402

This was a fast movie, damn fast, despite the 2 hours and 30 minute
running time. I would have given this movie more points had it not
been for the somewhat dull dialogue they gave the humans in this movie
to say. In some respects I felt sorry for the robots LOL>

However it wasn't all bad. There were tons of humourous moments and laughs
to be had so it did entertain, if only on a very small scale. what I and
I suspect most other people came to see this film for was the action
scenes.

And Bay doesn't disappoint in this department. The action once the big
battles start is great, if at times a little blurry. But it never lets
up, nor did it terribly disappoint me too much. However it was hard at
times to work out who were the good guys, and who were the bad guys
in the main battle scene near the end of the movie.

So with that in mind I gave it a 3 instead of a full score of 5. I will
probably buy the DVD when it comes out if only to see if there were some
deleted scenes or alternate scenes. I like that kind of stuff.

P.S> I did like Megan Fox. With her character's mechanical knowledge she

1614116,3,B00005JPNO,"By the title, I don't mean to imply that the FX are substandard.

Far from it! They are state-of-the-art, totally engaging, and jaw-dropping in the execution...representative of a film by Michael Bay...and there lies the problem.

Michael Bay is of the Irwin-Allen-School-of-Thought; that is, his films suffer from special effects overkill, at the expense of logic and character development. ""Transformers,"" for all its brilliance in the effects department, shoves the characters in your face and you get a ""Cliff Notes"" portrait of the human and robot characters. At least, Allen populated his films with some characters that you grew to love, even if they ""met their Maker"" during the film's running time.

Bay shoves in the characters so quickly that you really don't get to feel too much for any of them. The only time that I felt something for a character was when Autobot ""Bumblebee"" was being tortured by American scientists.

Bay also throws in lots of gung-ho-we-are-Americans-patriotism with the bravado of characters played by Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and John Turturro.

As far as other casting is concerned, Shia LaBeouf, with his youthful face, is able to pull off the ""high school nerd"" thing, but Megan Fox, with her well-developed ""attributes"" and sensuous lips, looks all of her twenty-one years. Even Travis Van Winkle as a muscle-bound high school star looks more like an assistant coach than a player!

""Transformers,"" like Bay's ""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Bad Boys,"" and ""The Rock,"" has a lot of BOOM in the F/X arena but FIZZES OUT when it comes to plot, characters, and dialog.

The film is one of those ONE-TIME-ONLY movies that you can say, ""Oh, yeah, I saw it...and that's about it!""",1187222400,37,1730,5.070422535211268
1614117,5,B00005JPNO,"Two races of intergalactical robots - the Autobots and the Decepticons - have been waging a century-long war on planet Cybertron for power of the AllSpark, a cube that keeps the surviving race alive. The former is led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the latter is led by Megatron (Hugo Weaving), who has been long since frozen inside the Hoover Dam in Las Vegas on Earth. Incidentally, the AllSpark is also frozen there too.

Connections to the AllSpark lead to nebbish high school student Sam Whitwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who plans on selling his grandfather's old glasses on eBay so he could afford enough cash to buy a new car and impress long-time crush Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). But when he realizes what potential the glasses are, he unwillingly becomes a factor in the fight between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Of course, he's not alone; he recieves help from army sergeants William Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Epps (Tyrese Gibson), Department of Defense assistant Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor), computer hacker Glen Whitman (Anthony Anderson), and Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight).

Having a legendary franchise like ""Transformers"" (comic books, TV shows, toys, and the like) transformed (no pun intended) into a summer blockbuster could've been one of the worst ideas ever. Especially when the man behind the lens in none other than Michael Bay, he of critical revulsion from message board geeks and ""South Park"" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

Of course, Bay didn't do bad in the past (I still hold ""The Rock"" as a great example of Bay delivering a megaton punch of visceral tension with jokes thrown in). It was once ""Armageddon"" came rolling in that he was looking to do more than just giving crowds a rip-roaring time, though I don't think a crap love story should be putting a damper on what could've been able competition against ""Independence Day"". But when Bay threw out his attempts to be fun, and have another ridiculously corny love story be the backdrop of a historic event, he brought upon the world the poison that was ""Pearl Harbor"". Then, his anger towards critics thus brought ""Bad Boys II"", which replaced the fun and charm of the first one with wreckless endagerment for an unbearable 147 minutes. Of course, Bay did pick up footing with the underrated and misunderstood sci-fi actioner ""The Island"", which ALMOST brought back memories of when he wasn't lashing out at critics.

Now it's 2007. With ""Transformers"", Bay comes in with some secret weapons. One of them is Steven Spielberg, basically one of the legendary directors of our time. It being a sci-fi film, like most of his films (E.T., War of the Worlds), helped increase anticipation for the film's release. Then there's Shia LaBeouf, the former ""Even Stevens"" co-star who recently blew up after the success of the ""Rear Window"" update ""Disturbia"". Throw those ingredients in with a bunch of other stars, Spielberg's Industrial Lights & Magic for the special effects, and an estimated budget of $147 million, and you've got this summer's largest crowd-pleaser ever.

With ""Transformers"", almost every robot of the famed franchise are thrown into the mix. Bay has the iconic Optimus Prime and Megatron, while throwing in minor figures like Barricade, Bonecrusher, Bumblebee, Frenzy, Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet, and Starscream into the wrestling ring. Much has been made to the movie-based versions of these robots. But thanks to IL&M, every one of them is wonderfully rendered with amazing attention to detail. Bay even gets a pat on the back for rangling in Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime in all Transformers cartoons, to reprise his role. Now that's pleasing the fanbase!

Where the team of Bay/Spielberg succeed is not taking the film too seriously, a la the cartoon. Much like ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"", there's a jocular tone to all the madness going on. Some of it does get a little heavy-handed (I could've dealt without a ""lubriaction"" gag, character actor Kevin Dunn hiding inside a tiny bathtub, or Sam getting cornered by Barricade - that scene plays for both laughs and suspense, and it comes off a little awkward), but thanks to a film free of bleakness that would normally weight the film down (see ""TMNT""), there's a high energy to the film that makes up for any flaws. Probably one of the bigger compliments to the nature of the film is character actor John Turturro; he's a ball of joy as the scenery-chewing FBI agent who gets his comeuppance from one of the Autobots (hint: Superman boxers are on display).

Of course, Bay puts a lid briefly on the jokes and delivers a whopping 40-minute-long, action-packed finale. Bay, being the mad director that he is, cuts away like crazy (a habit from ""Bad Boys II""), though he's a bit more restrained in letting viewers be immersed in the battle (once Smashing Pumpkins' ""Doomsday Clock"" begins playing, you'd better hang on to your theater seats). And Bay's staple of the marines are in also full force here, and he gives Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, awesome actors who may go big after the film comes and goes, plenty of time to play with guns. While Duhamel takes too much of Gibson's shine (the R&B singer/actor doesn't make much of an impression), both actors having a ball, and that's fine with me.

This is Shia LaBeouf's third movie in a row where a clunky performance is definitely out of the question. Sure, his smart-aleck persona is put in full force, though he's not too quick to lose our sympathy even in the humorous scenes when his character Sam fails in wooing Mikaela, who's surprsingly well played by Megan Fox (who could go wrong with an actress who appeared on the Kelly Ripa sitcom ""Hope and Faith"" posed for FHM/Maxim magazine, and plays X-box?). And there's great supporting performances from side actors like Rachael Taylor (despite being ridiculously attractive, she's actually believable as a government understudy), Anthony Anderson (who's a 100% hoot here), and Jon Voight (co-star of Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor once again plays a president, though here, he stands out more).

Not everyone is going to like this film (especially the Razzies assocation, probably understandable after Bay's recent bombs). But there are kids like me who want to have a giddy pre-teen jump out and relive our memorable past. ""Transformers"" is pretty much that movie.",1187222400,4,6394,4.951537744641193
1614118,4,B00005JPNO,"Just a few issues with the new Transformers movie.

COMEDY OR SCI-FI ACTION?  First of all, way too much cheesy humor.  I'm all for a funny one-liner or two, but much of the movie felt like it was striving to be a comedy.

TOO MUCH FRENZY; NOT ENOUGH MEGATRON:  Frenzy got more screen-time than any other Transformer, even moreso than Prime.  Megatron isn't seen until very late in the film.  When you do see him, he totally owns the screen, but I wish we could've seen more of Megatron. I could care less about watching the little boombox hacking into computers; I wanted to see the giant robots dukin' it out!

DID BARRICADE GET LOST? Barricade was nowhere to be seen in the climax, unless I missed him (I've seen the movie twice).  I was hoping to see him and Bumblebee go at it like they did earlier.  Come to think of it, Starscream mysteriously disappeared too, but he at least showed up for the climax.  Oh, and didn't Scorponok survive that barrage against the A-10's and the AC-130?  He burrowed into the ground and we never saw him again...

These are just a few things I've noticed.  I hope I didn't spoil anything for anyone.  The story left too many holes for me to give it five stars, but I certainly don't regret seeing Transformers.  Great film; I intend on buying the DVD.",1186876800,,1289,4.444444444444445
1614119,5,B00005JPNO,"You would think a movie about 2 warring factions--one on the side of good, the other evil incarnate-of mega-machines, who bring their battle to Earth, would get lost in a sea of special effects...Thanks to very engaging young stars though--the human story keeps the viewer very much involved--and that's why it works.

As the Decepticons, followers of the malevolent Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), plot to take over our world and its vast resources, the Autobots, led by the valiant Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), are intent on protecting humanity. When young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) discovers that his new car is really the Autobot Bumblebee (voiced by Mark Ryan), he soon finds himself in the middle of one ginormous showdown. In fact, through some wild twist of fate--Sam may indeed possess the key to the survival of mankind...

Whether you love or hate his style of filmmaking, you can't deny, director Michael Bay knows how to make glorious ""Popcorn Movies"". Everything audiences have come to expect from a Bay flick is here: Loud explosions, intense and thrilling action set pieces combine with dashes of both drama and romance. Transformers, like Armageddon before it, also boasts a huge cast of characters--each getting a chance to shine in the film...Josh Duhamel, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, Jon Voight, the always great Kevin Dunn playing Sam's Dad and Julie White playing Mom bring a lot to the table... There was an extra sotra something that's usually missing from a Bay flick--Chemistry between the leads.

For my money it's the performances of both LaBeouf and the lovely Megan Fox, who plays Sam's Gal Pal Mikaela Banes, that keep the ""human stuff"" afloat. I was as much into the story when they were on screen as I was when the ""robots"" were locked in combat. The pair made all of the fantastic stuff seem believable. Not an easy feat. I assure you says this cynic of a film-goer...

Given the film's animated origins, screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman did a solid job adapting the history for the big screen in a live action format. As a non-fan of the TV series and the line of toys, with just a passing familiarity of the backstory, every memory gap I had was filled in to my satisfaction. That said, I could have done without the typical action film writer crutch of ""let's have the law enforcer guy in charge look really dumb for the sake of comic relief"" (John Turturro)...Still no one plays smarmy quite like Turturro. I have heard some fans grumble that certain Transformer abilities were missing and so forth...As for me, I guess that's where my unfamiliarity over a lot of that stuff would come in handy.

Finally. What can I say about the CGI and special effects? Spectacular and stunning! Really exciting to watch . Whenever 'Bot shared screen space with human it looked flawless. Again no easy feat. Hands down the best on screen action of the summer!

Hats off to all involved-but most of all to Bay, who amidst all of its great eye candy, made the humans just as watchable. Perhaps the movie's greatest WOW of them all.",1186876800,,3087,4.815094339622641

The film re-introduces the Autobots and Decepticons to the new generations now that the level of technology allows it.
The movie combines action, adventure and comedy, thus resurrecting interest in the Transformers after a long dormant period.
Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor (both of whom are GORGEOUS!), Glenn Moreshower (from 24!), Michael O'Neill, Jon Voight, Bernie Mac, Kevin Dunn, and the rest of the cast have outdone themselves with their performances (the chemistry is AMAZING!), which are outstanding to say the least, making this movie one that can be watched over and over again!

[The Plot]:

The plot is true to Transformers mythos; Two factions (Autobots and Decepticons) battling over one powerful source necessary to either's agenda and survival. Immeasurable years ago, an artifact known only as the ""All Spark"" created the planet Cybertron and with it the life forms that would be known as ""Transformers"". For time there was peace, but through a series of unseen events, a civil war breaks out and consumes the world of Cybertron. The Autobots launch the All Spark into the farthest reaches of space, in hopes that the Decepticons would never find it.

But fate had other plans, it seems...

Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is on a mission to get his very first car; Bobby Boliva (Bernnie Mac) --- despite not knowing the origin of the vehicle --- sells him a rusty and faded 1977 Chevrolet Camaro, which ironically turns out an Robot in disguise. With a wreck of a car in hand, Sam attempts to win the heart of the high-school beauty, Mikeala Banes (Megan Fox), a longtime crush of his. However, one night Sam wakes up to his car being 'stolen' and ends up bearing witness to his vehicle transforming into a giant robot. Things from there, don't go so well for Sam.

Meanwhile, the Decepticons finally pinpoint the location of their desired target and his Ancestor's [Archibald Witwicky] glasses. Sam and Mikaela find themselves caught in the middle of an age old war that will decide the fate of their and the Transformer's planet alike. Thus, the movie introduces a frenzied host of characters, Decepticon, Autobot, and Human alike. All of which play more or less important roles in the film.

[Overview]:

Sufficed to say, Transformers, is one amazing movie, by far the best film released in 2007. Michael Bay has finally hit his highest mark and is nearly welcomed by Transformer Fans and general audiences alike. He, along with help of others, bring this movie to life in such an unimaginable way, I was left reeling from shock and amazement. The action sequences are absolutely stunning and true to Michael Bay's style of direction. The very moment Barricade transforms and Bumblebee comes racing out of the smoke to the instrumental version of ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"", the entire theater, including myself, went wild. Jason Broune movies aside, it was like the freaking revitalization of the Car Chase, man!

The CGI utilized in this film blows everything else past and present, out of the water. The way the Transformers seamlessly blend in with real world environment was stunning, notably during the scene in which the Autobots stand atop the observatory, debating over Bumblebee and the fate of the human race. They moved flawlessly, and rapidly during battles. Certainly a Oscar worthy animation, though I doubt the suits would even give it an honorable mention. On that note, the revamp of the overall look of the Transformers, was a smart move on Michael Bay's part. Illustrator, Ben Procter, creates stunningly realistic models of our heroes and villains, that are equally majestic and menacing in their own way.

The emotional impact, coupled with the score composed by Steve Jablonsky is simply breath-taking. He knows what mofits or themes to use in every scene. The emotional range of his music if felt in sequences using themes like ""Arrival"", ""Bumblebee's capture"" (a powerful moment between Sam and his guardian), and the major and most original theme I've heard this year, ""Decepticons"". Thankfully, though, Jablonsky is not all action and drama. A quirky theme, via ""Sam at the Lake"" is a joy to listen to. Overall, it mirrors the humor and drama, along with militaristic atmosphere of Bay's previous films as well as Hans Zimmer's other compositions, but never detracts from the fact that its Jablonsky own composition. I totally recommend picking up the score, its an excellent standalone.

[Voice Acting]:

The opening narrative sets the mood for the entire movie and to hear Optimus Prime's (Peter Cullen) voice echoing around me was like listening to an old friend you hadn't seen in ages. He certainly sounds different from when I last heard him (2003 officially), wiser I suppose, but I'm not complaining. At first, I was disappointed that didn't use the equally charismatic Gary Chalk of Beast Wars Fame (he was my favorite before I remembered Cullen), but when watching this movie, I understand why Peter Cullen was recruited to reprise his role as the sympathetic leader of Auotbots. His deliverly of the quote ""Sorry, my bad"", had me doing a double-take, big time.

When introduced, it takes a while to get used to the voice actors for the other Autobots. I found it ironic that I immediately took to Jess Harnell as Barricade but took my time getting used to him as Ironhide. I loved Robert Foxworth as Ratchet, his gravely-like tone just suited the character so well. Darius McCrary as Jazz was the one I had the hardest time accepting. It wasn't his acting, that was fine, it was more or less his accent --- ""What's crackin', little bitches?"" had me frowning immediately ---, was more akin to the 'ghetto accent' I've heard all my life (no racism implication intended). I wondered why they didn't use ""Scatman"" Crothers, until my parents informed me that he had died in 1986. I felt kinda silly then.

But on my second viewing, I was more or less used to McCary as Jazz, it suits the personality overall. Mark Ryan as Bumblebee, which is only heard for a few seconds, threw me for a loop. Given his seemingly energetic and youthful behavior --when he's not kicking Deceptichops --- supposedly based on Michael J. Fox's performance in Back to the Future, I thought the youngest Autobot would've sounded like Judd Nelson's Hot Rod in the 1986 movie. Instead you hear this cultured, aged voice coming out his repaired voice box. It takes some getting used to, but in retrospect, I think it suits his character quite well now.

When concerning the Decepticons the voices used are few and sometimes not heard long enough to judge properly. Hugo Weaving as Megatron, though distorted, suits the more menacing version of Megatron. The first time I heard him, I couldn't believe it was him. However, there are moments in which you can hear Weaving's accent in lines like ""Is is fear or Courage that Compells you?"". He was the perfect counterpart to Cullen's Prime. Charlie Adler as Starscream was a decent portrayal, though like Ryan, has a few lines, so I cannot properly gauge his performance beyond 'decent'. Reno Wilson as Frenzy, was entirely enjoyable. From his indecipherable gibbering, and high-pitched screams, I just couldn't get enough of him, he was a riot! And lastly, Jamie Wood .... as, well, Bonecrusher, makes a perfect guttural growl for the violent Decepticon, given he has no lines whatsoever. He sent shivers down my spine, that much is for certain. The electronics provided for Blackout, Scorponok, and Devastator, were only just too cool.

[Live Action Acting]:

With Shia LaBeouf's enormous success in the movies, I am simply amazed by how far he's come since Even Stevens. As Sam Witwicky, his comedic and dramatic performances shine through and were simply enjoyable. His interaction with the CGI Bumblebee and the Autobots/Decepticons was utterly convincing. You could actually sense a relationship between him and his non-existent counterparts. His chemistry with Megan Fox was believable, quirky even, at times.

Megan Fox herself defies the limitations of her role as Mikeala Banes, time and time again, dramatically, comedic-wise, and especially in action sequences. I've never liked Josh Duhamel, but as Capt. William Lennox, I can easily say its the only time I found myself enjoying his presence on the screen. Tyrese Gibson as Sgt. Epps, was just as likeable, especially. Thankfully, his performance keeps away from Will Smith-like characterizations in movies like ""Independence Day"" and ""Bad Boys.""

Jon Voight and John Turturro as Secretary of Defense John Keller and Agent Simmons played decent government officials; Turturro was a riot, Voight's accent reminded me far too much of our President (who even makes a mock-appearance in the film). Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson as Maggie Madsen and Glen Whitmann, made decent characters you would've liked to see more of. Anderson made more of a convincing Hacker than Talyor did an Annalist, though the way she rambled things off in her Aussie Accent, which I'm glad they let her use, is simply a joy to listen to.

Others like Kevin Dunn, Julie White (Ron and Judy Witwicky), Michael O'Neill (Tom Banachek, The head of Sector 7), and Bernie Mac (Bobby Bolivia) were all convincing in their contrasting roles that either moved to the film forward or just made you laugh. Even Amaury Nolasco (Figueroa) with his quirky Spanish speaking character and Zack Ward (First Sgt Donnelly), who gets killed yet again, were enjoyable characters in their brief appearances.

All in all, if your looking for the ultimate Summer Movie, Michael Bay's Transformers is the one to watch. If not, stick to the movies before and after its advent. --- [a 5 out of 5].

1614154,2,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" is a movie that moves fast, has a lotta moving parts, is really colorful, and comes out in a fast-moving torrent.

In other words, it's a lot like vomit.

These days, it seems like everybody's saying ""relax, turn off your brain, you'll enjoy it"". That's fine, up to a point. But Bay's ""Transformers"" is a movie with a bad case of Attention Deficit Disorder, one bordering on mental retardation. ""Transformers"" doesn't merely ask you to turn off your brain: it demands you lobotomize yourself with an icepick.

You've got a mega-bucks action flick that just can't seem to get any satisfaction out of its numberless set-pieces. A great example is what could have been a doozie of a sequence, the chase scene between a Decepticon police interceptor and the Corvette ""Bumblebee""---just when you're digging in to enjoy the ride, it's over.

It's a puzzling, aggravating film that never really gets comfortable with any of its action scenes, and, oddly, demonstrates none of Bay's usual kinetic skill when it comes to pacing. I'm going on faith that Bay didn't have an interest in bringing any of the Transformers themselves to life: in that regard, he succeeds, giving meaning to a one-liner I heard an old Hum-Vee dealer say once upon a time: ""they're all just big pieces of steel to me.""

Anyway, look: I'm a simple guy. I'm not asking for a lot. I would have been giddy with straight robot on robot action, and nothing else, and lots of stuff exploding, for two hours. Why does Bay have to get all lathered up over a plot on something like this?

It's not all burned out spark plugs and dead batteries, though: this movie is loaded up with some things I dug, including pretty battle robots, a pretty chick (Megan Fox) whose front chassis does a little transforming of its own, a bloodthirsty police car that puts a new spin on ""bear in the air"", and the overall untintentional bloodthirstiness of this ostensibly PG-13 flick.

Basically you have big, nasty battle-robots throwing it down with tac-nukes, vulcan machine guns, gatling guns, SAM missiles, the works. Throwing it down in a densely populated urban environment. And while Bay's not graphic here, it's obvious a lotta people are taking some dirt naps while our big metal boys duke it out, which is pretty sick, funny sick, and brings an entirely new meaning to phrase ""collateral damage.""

Or as they say, when the Going gets tough, the Tough get a napalm hose.

One tip, though: pick up the pillow *and* the collision insurance. Chances are you're gonna need both of 'em.

I remember watching the cartoon as a young child, but didn't remember anything other than the cool transformations from cars to robots and back to cars.  I didn't remember anything about the plot, or the ""good"" and the ""bad"" transformers, nor much less the transformers' names.

 Let me say that this movie is highly enjoyable even if you fit the description above.  It is front-loaded with action as the ""bad"" Transformers, the Decepticons, begin appearing and hacking into the U.S. mainframe computers.  The development of the plot takes a backseat to non-stop action for the first half of the movie.  It isn't until the second half of the movie that the plot is really laid out by explaining how the Transformers came about and what they are doing on Earth.  The final fight sequence between the Transformers is awesome to say the least, and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The only reason why I did not give this movie 4 stars is because the half part of the movie is strictly devoted to plot development and completely devoid of action.",1186272000,,1233,4.671296296296297
1614157,3,B00005JPNO,"""Transformers"" is directed by Michael Bay, responsible for such big-budget films like ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor""; it is also based on the popular Hasbro toys and cartoons and is executive-produced by none other than Steven Spielberg. Now if these facts are not enough for you to imagine what kind of film ""Transformers"" would be, see the film's trailer in which cars and other vehicles change into robots in the most astonishing way.

Good news is that in ""Transformers"" you can see one of the most stunning special effects. The most impressive part is the details of those ""Transformers"" themselves, actually extra-terrestrial creatures that have traveled to the Earth. Thanks to people at the special effect and design division, these robots and their movements are always amazing and often amusing to see. The crazy idea about the shape-shifting metallic creatures hiding in the backyard is just fun as well as the wonderful designs of the robots themselves.

Bad news (for me, at least) is that it takes too much time for us to get to know these robots, the ""good"" ones and the ""bad"" ones alike. Four young actors appear -- Shia LaBeouf (to be seen in the fourth Indiana Jones film), Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel and Rachael Taylor, and I like them and their characters, but the film would not be much different with one or two less characters because after all the film is about ""Transformers.""

Another disappointing thing about the film is that not enough time is spent to show the personalities of each robot. And once the battle between them begins, it is hard to see who is fighting who, because of the hectic pace and flashy camerawork. Why not take more time to show what these amazing creatures really can do?

""Transformers"" is fun, perhaps goofy kind of fun, but Michael Bay knows what he is doing as several self-referential lines suggest. The story is preposterous, but that's fine with me. But I really think the film could be better with shorter time on humans and more time on Transformers, with more orthodox approach to actions.",1186272000,,2050,4.848571428571429

What is the trend?  You die hard fans are a bit too critical of the film because of the human perspective brought forth my Spielberg and Bay, instead of focusing on the autobots only.

My favorite moments in the film were dialogue driven, not action driven.  The scenes with Shia LaBeouf and Bumblebee are classic (I was laughing extremely hard) and it made me want to go buy a yellow Camero.  The script obviously could have used a little trimming (the movie was too long by about twenty minutes, but that doesn't take away any stars for me).  I viewed a late showing, so when it got to the end I was feeling a bit cranky and probably didn't enjoy the end like I should of...I guess I will need to see it again!

The script was well written; very witty dialogue, and I enjoyed the fact the story was told from such a likeable character vs. from anothers perspective.  The dialogue between the 'bots was well done also; they appealed to our emotions (obvious Spielberg).

This seems to be the biggest problem with the die-hard fans; ""why not tell it from the 'bots perspectives rather than the human ones?""  My answer is this: ""To appeal to a larger audience then you guys.""  It's that simple people; this movie cost a lot to make, so it's obvious the film needs to make money.  This film is a classic example of taking a great idea (the transformers concept and story) and crossing it with our current pop-culture and entertainment value.  I was entertained, as was every one else in the theater.  The story has a great story from the transformers perspectives for you guys, and the film also has the other elements for whom do not know the story well, such as myself.

The effects were incredible, some of the best I have ever seen.

Hope you all enjoyed my review!  (For story and plot summary read all of the other reviews; rehashing the plot every review gets amazingly repetitive).

The reason for the two stars goes to the robotics, these metal giants looked good and the transformations were cool.  The movie overall was ridiculous.  Imagine, you are told that certain things need to get done otherwise the planet you know as earth will be destroyed, coupled with mind bogling harvoc going on all around, you are worried about your mother's rose garden.  Pathetically unrealistic!  The Transformers looked and acted more real than the humans.  Maybe this is what Stephen tried to convey, that humans are becoming robots in their day to day activities.

1614199,3,B00005JPNO,"To rate a movie I always ask myself almost the same 5 following questions, and this was the result:
1. Would I buy the DVD when released, to own this movie in my collection?
Answer: NO
2. Did the movie achieved the purpose to entertain me?
Answer: NO.
I lost the interest a few minutes after the movie started. The orientation of the movie was inclined more to be a comedy than an action movie (When we talk about the TRANSFORMERS, we're talking about ""FULL ACTION"" FIGHTING/WAR/EXPLOSIONS/INVASION/ETC) Comedy and Action/Horror in a movie like this is a risky option!!!  The fighting scenes were too fast, that it was really hard to concentrate in one point of the scene to follow the movements of your heroes during the fighting.  However, the transformation scenes were so cool, and the FX so convincing that this is where the rating gets 1 star.  So I stayed watching the movie just to enjoy the FX.
3. Was the PLOT, interesting? Good? Innovative? Thrilling? Solid or consistent? Shocking? Etc
Answer: NO
The PLOT had many holes and it was loose in many parts, like there were many good ideas thrown together to see what you get...
4. Was the cast good in any way & convincing in their roles, dialogues, etc?
Answer: YES & NO
Some characters take their role seriously, but others are so bad that you just want them to disappear from the movie, hoping that they get killed by the DECEPTICONS, or get smashed by any of the flying objects during the fights; unfortunately that does not happen, since the movie is a comedy and nobody dies :(
So..., the bad casting stays there, annoyingly doing what they do best, nothing but ruin the movie.  Still I decided to give another star just for the good casting... the ROBOTS!!!!
5. Directing/Editing/Production this is a huge category and I won't enter in details, but considering that it was a Steven Spielberg's production I gave another star, even though I was kind of disappointed that Spielberg produced such flaw movie.  I expected more from him.",1185926400,2,1997,4.694285714285714
1614200,3,B00005JPNO,"Director Michael Bay will never win any awards for subtlety with his industrial-strength, testosterone-heavy popcorn movies. His prevalent use of quick cuts and hand-held shots, compounded by car chases, explosions and other CGI-saturated effects, are all accounted for in this juvenile-oriented 2007 action picture, but I have to admit that there is a welcome sense of humor in the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci that manages to bring this one a cut above Bay's previous endeavors like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island/dp/B000BO0LH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island</a>. Humor is a smart approach in tackling potentially unfamiliar terrain such as Hasbro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000M6F3U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;franchise, which had its heyday in the 1980's, before much of the film's audience was born. Yet, at the same time, there is a need to remain true to the spirit of the original premise without changing it in order to pacify baby boomers who would not accept anything less than the myth. In meeting both those objectives, the film meets expectations as an intermittently entertaining summer film.

The convoluted story has to do with two warring factions of shape-changing robots - the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons - who both depend on a monolithic entity known as the Cube for sustaining their races. Just how it does it is beyond my comprehension, as do most of the plot details having to do with the Transformers and their planet Cybertron. What make marginally more sense is the main storyline around an awkward, huckstering teenager named Sam Witwicky, who is the descendent of an explorer whose glasses hold the key to the Cube. Sam wants a car badly and gets a beat-up Camaro which naturally turns out to be an Autobot. He also wants Mikaela, a girl who seems way out of his league until her mechanical skills and checkered past come to the fore. While this boy-meets-car-and-girl story is simmering, there are other subplots involving an army unit in the Middle East battling the Decepticons, a computer hacker who frustrates the Secretary of Defense with her complex yet undeniable deductive reasoning, and a group of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Files</a>-type agents, led by an overbearing zealot, who try to take Sam and Mikaela into custody.

There doesn't seem to be great priority placed on resolving the various plotlines, except for the first one and only after twenty minutes of quick-action destruction held mostly in medium shots in an assumed attempt to exaggerate the parameters of the action. Oddly, the climax has more of a benumbing effect since it's difficult to tell the scope of the action with much of it feeling clunky and repetitive until the exhausting finish. Before that, many scenes come across as inexplicable, over-explained or just too drawn out to enjoy fully, for example, the comically clumsy Autobots hiding around Sam's parents' house. Emphasizing the derivative nature of Bay's approach here are snatches of film classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;and especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B00005JO20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>&nbsp;used throughout, and the influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg can be felt in Sam's responsibility-driven storyline.

Bay and the screenwriters deserve credit for humanizing the robots just enough to make them compelling to the viewer, though honestly not enough to empathize that much with their fates. It's not for lack of trying, as for example, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime, provides stentorian fervor and palpable dignity to the role. The human performances are in line with a comic-book-style franchise. Shia LaBeouf has the most screen time as Sam. The young actor makes Sam a likable reluctant hero, though he's fairly limited beyond his constant look of amazement. The real scene stealers are John Turturro as the unctuous agent, Anthony Anderson as a squealing hacker and recent Tony winner Julie White as Sam's overprotective mother.  Barely registering is Josh Duhamel as the heroic head of the army unit and Megan Fox in form-fitting wear as Mikaela. All in all, it's pretty clear that the movie defies logic and relies heavily on sensory overload to sustain itself. The unexpected comedy elements are what make it better than at least what I expected.",1185753600,2,4777,6.030927835051546
1614201,4,B00005JPNO,"When I was a little girl, I lived for my Barbies, Polly Pockets, Lego etc. Typical girly stuff. Having no brothers, or anything like that, I didn't know much about Transformers. I originally went to see this at the cinema, before seeing it again on blu ray, and I walked into the cinema, not knowing anything about Transformers.

After having seen it twice now, I have to admit I'm not a total convert, but Transfomers is amazing. The effects have to be seen to believed. And the the cinema showing I went to see was filled with twenty-somethings (no kids that I could see), reliving their childhood obviously.

I'm not 100% sure about Shia LeBouf in this role. Yes, he can do the one-liners, he can look 'cool' on screen, but I'm not sure, there was something that just didn't quite click for me. The first time you see Megan Fox, I was ready to start hissing, and getting my claws out, but she actually redeems herself. Initially, it looks like she was going to be portrayed as some sort of bimbo, but not so. Although I do resent the fact that Megan is a gorgeous actress, who has tattoos. Why do directors etc feel the need to cover these things up???

The story's been explained a few times already, amongst the reviewers, so I won't bore you by repeating what everyone else has said already. But the movie is amazing, although some reviewers have a thing against Michael Bay directing. But he did an excellent job on this. It could have so easily have gone wrong, especially with so many fans looking forward to it.

I'm not sure which was my favourite Transfomer. I liked Ironhide, because he had the best lines. There was also talk of a female Transformer, which could have been interesting, but I take it they obviously didn't know how to do it. Without doing the obvious and having a female voice - do Transformers have genders?

Transfomers works brilliantly on blu ray, it's flawless, and almost as brilliant as it was in the cinema. I look forward to the sequel, when it eventually comes out, as I'm sure it will be as brilliant as the first.",1185753600,,2055,4.513440860215054

I was thinking about how sleazy and commercialized--stuffed with product placement--American films have become, how character development doesn't happen much, how weirdly disjointed (in an almost ADD appealing way) modern movies can be, how CGI often looks like an unpleasant blur of nothing-in-particular, how scripts come across like collages assembled by committees rather than like organic and articulated things...and then I was thinking about how people aren't really noticing and commenting on these issues much and, well, I went to the movies so I wouldn't have to think and there I was, thinking more than I had thought all week.

1614206,5,B00005JPNO,"I watched Transformers at a late night preview, really just to kill some dead time. I took a view that it would probably be a good time filler, I am not a real fan of the 1980s series but was intrigued by some of the positive reviews that I had read about the film...

What I got instead was the best Action/ Sci Fi film so far this year, filled  not only with incredible SFX but great performances from the flesh and blood cast, despite playing second fiddle to the towering robots...
Shia Laboeuf turns in a great performance as Sam, a nerdy lad who has to make the jump to all action hero, saving the world while being under some very frightening fire, indeed.
Aiding and protecting him in this is his car - a clapped out Camaro which is actually one of the good Transformers, a warrior robot called Bumblebee. The relationship between Bumblebee and Laboeuf is both amusing and touching, and the scenes where the car is trying to help Laboeuf get the girl of his dreams are pure class.

The plot sees the good Autobots led by the towering Optimus Prime taking on the evil Decepticons, led by the even larger and very menacing Megatron. Young Sam is in possession of some information which could prove  invaluable to either side, and the Decepticons will quite literally use any means possible to obtain this. The Autobots protect Sam, all the while having to take on the Decepticons and a largely incredulous US Army and Air Force.

The action sequences are stunning and watching them in a cinema is like seeing a Terminator film for the first time. Sound and vision are stunning. Characterisation is great, with humour and adult themes nicely spliced between the action and SFX. The SFX themselves represent in my opinion the best use to date of the CGI technology which is seamless in this film.
Transformers is a film that demands to be seen in a cinema and I for one will be treating myself to an encore. Congratulations to Michael Bay for pulling this one out of the hat, after the stinker that was The Island.",1185321600,,2018,4.532967032967033

The movie Transformers is based on the old cartoon about cars that can change into Robot forms. They were a real big name back then, and Michael Bay has just revived them.

This isn't the first time Michael Bay has made a movie that's very dissapointing-- if nothing else, he has taken a good show and overloaded a movie to the point of 2 hours and 25 minutes!

Let's face it, the action IS penomenal to say the least. Good special effects, and a good cast. However, the acting is weak, the script is lame, and some of the humor is off-putting (that cop getting urinated on?)

I'm not gonna give too much away, but if nothing else, the film is very anit-climatic. The only partially climatic part is at the end, when ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park is used. Other than this, Michael Bay has taken what was a good show and made it into one 145-minute mess!

1614243,4,B00005JPNO,"What happens when you take robots that transform into various modes of transportation who were in a highly successful 80's cartoon, have had continued success as a toy line, have a generation of men who followed their adventures since they were kids AND STILL buy their toys with the backing of Steven Spielberg and the direction of action/explosives master Michael Bay?  You get the perfect summer blockbuster:  Transformers.

With CGI capabilities solid enough to keep up with transformations, Michael Bay has planted a popcorn-friendly picture on the screen.  Any man under forty probably has very fond memories of the ""Transformers"" cartoons and toys, and this film does nothing but satisfy those memories.  Bay was careful to include a number of sentimental components in this modern re-telling of the war between the Autobots and Decepticons including the original voice of Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and original ""transform"" sounds from the old TV series.  He also tweaked a few of the robots' body styles (thanks heavily due to Volkswagen's refusal to let them use the Beetle and a rather large contribution from GM) without sacrificing any memories.

The cast was excellent.  From the gullible and goofy Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) to Defense Secretary Keller (Jon Voight, having a lot of fun on the screen), everyone did a great job.  John Turturro turns in a cheeky performance as Sector 7 agent Simmons and ""Suite Life Of Zack and Cody"" co-star Brian Stepanek adds to the fun as Simmons' lackey.  Josh Duhamel (Lennox), Tyrese Gibson (Epps), and Zack Ward (Donnelly) play U.S. soldiers who have an early run-in with the Decepticons.  Megan Fox plays Sam's love interest, Mikaela Banes.  Bernie Mac has a brief but funny role as car salesman supreme, Bobby Bolivia.  The funniest performances of the film come from Anthony Anderson as computer hacker Glen Whitmann and his cousin who's name I can't recall.

Recognizable voices of the Transformers include the aforementioned Cullen, Darius McCrary (TV's ""Family Matters"")as Jazz, and Hugo Weaving (""V for Vendetta,"" LOTR trilogy and ""The Matrix"" films) as Megatron.

The entire cast and crew knew that a film about warring robots from another planet who transform sounds rather silly when pitched to a non-""in the know"" crowd, so they were very careful to add plenty of humor, both satirical and nostalgic, to please anybody in the crowd.

The story is fun to watch, but does have its shortcomings.  For one, it's a little bit too long.  It clocks in at almost two and a half hours and while it's fun to watch the relationship build up between Sam and Bumblebee and eventually the other Autobots, it would have been nice to have a couple of the Decepticons, namely Megatron and Starscream, fleshed out a little more.  Bay also had to meet the sacred ""PG-13"" rating in order to promote the film to both new, younger Transformers fans and the well-established 80's bunch.  There are a number of sequences in the film where obvious editing was done to meet that rating and avoid the dreaded ""R"" rating.  Also, and perhaps due to the editing, many of the sequences in the film feel as if they are incomplete.  Perhaps the DVD will remedy this problem.  Other than that, this is a definite winner for the popcorn crowd and any old guy like myself who grew up with the Transformers.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who grew up with the Transformers and kids over the age of thirteen.",1184716800,7,3448,4.915371329879102
1614244,4,B00005JPNO,"No spoilers here since everyone else took care of that.
Transformers The Movie surprised me in a positive way. Shia LeBeouf shines, Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor sizzle as well as add beauty and brains to the equation. The only thing I found disappointing was the abundance of adult language. Yes... I realize they couldn't go to an R rating without losing the largest portion of the targeted audience, the 7 to 17 year olds. I guess I noticed this more because of the number of parents that dropped their kids (6-10) off in ""Transformers PG-13"" while they went to see the new ""Die Hard"" next door. It wasn't long before the children were flipping birds and shouting out the obscenities that were in the movie toward the other ""not-as-young"" audience members. If you're going to bring a child to a PG13 or higher rating at least have the decency to stay with them and see that they do two things. One... don't mimic the onscreen antics and shout the obscenities at the top of your lungs. Second... see that they respect the others in attendance. Back to the movie now...
Transformers had more action than I expected and kept me entertained throughout the viewing. The CGI was incredible and the plot (remember this is a cartoon to action movie translation) was reasonably well delivered. I saw this film twice. Once during a matinee and another at a midnight movie. I recomend going to the midnight movie and avoiding the annoying little rugrats that ruined my second viewing. Remember this could've been a five-star review if not for the offscreen antics of unattended children shouting obscenities that they were learning from the movie in front of them. I know I should rate only the movie but it is hard to ignore the ugliness that grows in a child once they believe that obscene language and inconsiderate behavior is natural and acceptable. Especially when their parents periodically stop in to check on them, witness the bad behavior and then turn and walk away without so much as a reprimand. I find it greatly annoying when children mimic rude and inconsiderate behavior and then think its cute to constantly repeat.",1184630400,,2124,4.774456521739131

After having sat stone-faced through many of the alleged ""comedies"" foisted upon us in recent months - ""Evan Almighty,"" ""License to Wed,"" even ""Shrek the Third,"" to name just a few - I'm pleased to announce that I laughed quite a bit throughout the course of ""Transformers"" - and I do mean good-sized belly-laughs, not mere titters or snickers.  Prime credit for that obviously goes to screenwriters, Roberto Orci and Ales Kurtzman, but I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge Shia LaBeouf's contributions in this regard.  In this his first certified blockbuster, LaBeouf finally achieves the superstardom he`s been steadily heading towards the past several years.

As everyone already knows, ""Transformers"" is based on a phenomenally successful line of Hasbro toys as well as the animated series derived therefrom.  Transformers are giant robots from outer space who have the ability to metamorphose into the shape of virtually any everyday mechanical device - cars, cell phones, boom boxes etc. - they so desire.  In the film, the transformers have just arrived on earth in search of a mysterious box that has the power to create an army of such robots that, given unbridled freedom, would be able to take over the world.  Some of the transformers have evil intentions while others have an affinity for mankind and do their best to keep us out of the clutches of the bad guys.  LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a brainy, perpetually tongue-tied (especially when he's trying to impress the unreachable girl of his dreams), social outcast whose father agrees to help him buy a rundown Camaro that, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually a good transformer in disguise just waiting for Sam to become his owner.

It goes without saying that, on a strictly technical level, the transformers have made a stunning transition to the live action format.  There are brief moments when they appear a trifle fake, but director Michael Bay keeps the action moving along at such a dizzying pace, that we rarely have time to notice that flaw.  I'm not one who normally goes in for Bay's cuisinart style of moviemaking - near-subliminal quick cuts mixed in with endless explosions and rafter-rattling sound effects - but I think it works quite well in this instance.  He's also blessed in having LaBeouf as his lead actor, for it is LaBeouf's non-threatening All-American Boy looks and wide-eyed innocence that give the movie the emotional grounding it needs to be more than just the lumbering mechanical creation it could easily have become without him.  In fact, whenever he isn't on screen, the movie does, indeed, threaten to devolve into just the standard popcorn action movie filled with jaw-dropping special effects but minus a heart or soul (the transformers themselves are never very interesting as characters and they are stuck mouthing sappy platitudes whenever they do get a chance to speak).  But LaBeouf brings to the movie the human dimension it needs to keep our interest.

Kevin Dunn and Julie White are thoroughly delightful as Sam's well-meaning but utterly befuddled parents, while Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also score high on the laughter meter. For purposes of gravitas, movie veterans Jon Voight and John Turturro are also along for the ride.

And quite a ride it turns out to be, I must say.  ""Transformers"" has pretty much everything a modern-day blockbuster needs to be successful.  But it is the rare good humor with which the movie plays its hand that is so completely unexpected - and so very much appreciated in this quarter.",1184544000,71,3802,4.970031545741325

There is a brief mentioning of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum computations (which is what the robots intelligence is based on). However it breaks down from there on, with some bad acting and disjointed/out of place scenes and dialogue. The action toward the end tend to be too fast, blurry and repetitive, even boring. The FX are excellent and the CGI is getting better and better nowadays, blending in very well with live action.

1614279,4,B00005JPNO,"Let me just say that I was impressed with Transformers!  Due to the trend of flops of those who attempted to convert cartoons to live (ex: Garfield), I wasn't really interested in seeing this.  (And I grew up with the cartoons and the toys.)  However, since friends wanted to get together and see this film, I tagged along.  Boy, am I glad that I came along.  I had my eyes glued to the screen.  I refused to give in to my full bladder, threatening to burst.

Both the Autobots and the Decepticons have landed on Earth, in seach for the AllSpark.  The AllSpark is a powerful cube that can convert technologies to robots, which means that the Earth can be converted to a home that the robots once had but was destroyed.

However, to get the AllSpark, the Transformers must locate a coded map that has been etched on a pair of glasses.  Sam Witwicky has it and has been trying to sell it via eBay.  The glasses originally were Sam's great-grandfather's.  His great-grandfather discovered the AllSpark and a frozen Megatron.

However, the AllSpark (and Megatron) are in the hands of the American military.  Instead of locating the glasses, the Decepticons, cutting corners, decided to invade the military's database.  However, the robots soon learn that humans are not quite so primitive as they thought.

On the other hand, the Autobots have seeked out Sam Witwicky and the glasses.  They've got to get to the AllSpark before the the Decepticons do.

All I can say is that it is action packed!  As a matter of fact, it's like you need to have ADD or ADHD in order to catch up to the fast morphing and battle scenes.  In addition, I had no idea that Transformers would be so funny.

Transformers gets 4 stars because the storyline was a bit weak with some areas that just didn't make sense.  Nonetheless, I was impressed!",1184544000,,1818,4.598130841121495
1614280,3,B00005JPNO,"Before I relate the film's many faults, I should first acknowledge the movie's highly entertaining qualities.  First and foremost, the digital rendering of the transformers is spectacular.  They move quickly and violently with shiny and shape-shifting certainty, at ease in a manner that the 1980s cartoon could not properly relate.  The very concept of the transformers was far beyond hand-drawn animation.  The new transformers are truly awesome and majestic in stature.  Their capacity for carnage should be the envy of all action movies.

The cartoon succeeded due heavily to the incredible voice acting.  I was pleased that Peter Cullen agreed to lend his booming, voice-of-God talents to the character of Optimus Prime.  His talents, however, are not exploited as they should have been.  He acts as the film's narrator, delivering the familiar opening narrative and epilogue I witnessed in nearly every episode of the cartoon.  He is the most reflective of all the transformers, yet he is not allowed to relate his wisdom as often as he should have been in this movie.

One bit of voice acting that bothered me was that of Jazz.  In the old cartoon, Jazz was voiced by Scatman Crothers, the caretaker of the hotel in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  The late Crothers' voice was replaced with a decidedly ""urban black hipster"" voice (Darius McCrary), which sounded incredibly racist and completely unnecessary.  To complete the racial profiling, Jazz can be seen hanging and climbing around the city like a monkey in a jungle.  It was painful to watch and halted my suspension of disbelief.

Further, who decided that the transformers needed to talk like teenagers and crack stupid jokes?  They are in a fight for the existence of the universe, yet when Optimus Prime tramples a lawn ornament, he excuses himself, saying, ""My bad.""  It's somewhat funny, but I wanted to be concerned about the plot, yet I was constantly sidestepped by ridiculous one-liners and idiocy on the part of this supposedly superior race of organic robots.

There are far too many human characters taking precedence in this film: too many subplots, too many gorgeous girls, often in unbelievable roles.  The only necessary human character is Sam Witwicky (enthusiastically played by Shia LeBeouf).  Why did we need a cameo by Bernie Mack?  He's funny, yes, but his character is completely irrelevant.  And John Turturro, whom I revere as a great character actor, looks desperate.  While incredibly cheesy, Jon Voight manages to act the part of U.S. Secretary of Defense with a slice of dignity.

Plot holes: Wow, there are so many, I quit bothering with them.  The central problem of the entire movie - and one can say this of all of Michael Bay's films - is that Bay does not trust the subject matter to carry the film.  Self-referential comments about his film Armageddon are embarrassing, indeed.  And the product placement in this film sometimes takes the viewer so far outside the film that one would think GM engineered the entire narrative to sell gas-guzzling cars.

I wanted to like this movie, but something was missing.  That element of believable science fiction is completely neglected in this film.  You only get ten or twenty minutes of fun sci-fi action before some character makes a stupid joke or a plot hole spreads out before you.  If there is a sequel to this film (and there should be) and Michael Bay doesn't direct it (and he shouldn't), the groundwork is there.",1184457600,24,3466,4.973913043478261

1614282,4,B00005JPNO,"NOTE: I am not, nor have I ever been, a big Transformers fan.  I have read the negative reviews thoroughly, and it appears as if most of them were written by die-hard fans who were disappointed by minutiae such as the fact that the robots didn't have some of the same names or shapes as they did in the cartoons.  I am not here to discount those opinions; I'm just saying that if you are Transformers fanatic, those are probably the reviews you should reference.  I'm just a guy who wanted to see a chaotic action film about shape-shifting robots.  That is to say, I had no emotion invested in the film before I bought my ticket.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've heard talk about Transformers being overdone, ridiculously campy, and full of logical inconsistencies.  I will agree that it is all of those things.  And that is why I liked it.

I think, to be fair, you should ask yourself exactly what you expect out of a movie about alien androids who express human emotions and who seem to derive sexual satisfaction out of jacking into the Pentagon and downloading top secret files.  The movie, in perhaps the fifth line of (human) dialogue, lets the entire audience know, right up front, no secrets, that this will be a cheese fest.  A group of military men flying into Qatar are talking about what they most long for back home.  Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) looks wistfully off-camera and says, ""I just want to get home so I can hold my baby girl in my arms for the first time.""

Right.  So, is it ruining the movie for you if I say that one of the final scenes is of Captain Lennox holding his baby girl in his arms for the first time?  No, it's not.  This is a Michael Bay movie, after all.  There's one thing that movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock/dp/6304711891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Boys-II/dp/B0000DKDUR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Boys II</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armageddon/dp/B00000G3PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armageddon</a>&nbsp;all have in common, and it isn't subtlety or restraint.  It would be foolish to expect anything different from this film.

Consider the plot: mighty morphing extra-terrestrial sentient machines that listen to digital satellite radio and occasionally browse through E-bay are having a Civil War.  One of the things they are fighting over is something called the Allspark, a powerful cube that existed ""before time began"" (natch) and which has the power to turn seemingly innocent Nokia telephones and 7Up soda machines into blood-thirsty automatons.  The war between the two factions -- the Autobots and the Decepticons -- comes to Earth when the cube, by pure narrative chance, sails through the vast emptiness of space and crash lands onto the tiny blue rock we call home.

Cue the CGI guys.

On a purely visceral level, it's a thrill just to watch these hulking metal monsters move and morph.  The effects are truly stupendous.  Although the very nature of these creatures means that the battle scenes can be dizzying and hard to track, it also means that just watching one of these things pick its nose is fun.

Okay, so they don't pick their noses.  But they do blink.  And sometimes, when they're hit by a missle and knocked down, they grunt and moan.  And one of them break-dances and speaks with a ghetto-jive accent.

If you're not turned off by now, then you should see this movie.  The human cast exists mainly to give us reaction shots to the fireballs and titanium tete-a-tetes, and they also provide their own brand of roll-your-eyes humor (one kid watches an Autobot crash land and says, ""This is way cooler than Armageddon!"")  Anthony Anderson, Jon Voight, and an inexplicable John Turturro all do their fair share of mugging and scenery chewing, maybe trying valiantly to match with their gusto and gooniness the scene-stealing power of a giant, looming robot.

The one character you'll buy (and the only one you need to) is the young and horny Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf (doing his best Shia LaBeouf impression).  When he's talking to the hottest girl in school (played by Megan Fox, who most certainly would've been the hottest girl at my school), or being teased by the girl's cocksure jock of a boyfriend (said jock's torments include airborne paper clips and pointing out Sam's poor talent at sports; harsh!), Sam is your typically awkward and frustrated young kid.  But Shia doesn't just rely on the old theatrics of cliched adolescence; he actually acts in this film, and he does it well.

Which is saying a lot.  I'm not sure if most of us would have a ready response to the discovery that our car is, in fact, an Autobot named Bumblebee.  But Shia's seemed spot-on, funny as well as legitimate.  He is wowed by the experience, but accepts it glibly, giving the audience a sort of home base of humanity.  Sam never wonders if the Autobots actually have bumblebees on their home planet (if the flashbacks are any indication, the planet doesn't even have flowers); it's clear by the expression on his face that he doesn't understand what's going any more than he needs to.  It's also clear that, in spite of the 800 or so times that he almost dies, he's still kinda sorta having fun.  And, who knows?, maybe he'll get the girl!

What do you want?  Deep emotional resonance?  Wry, clever dialogue that expresses a depth of insight into the philosophical implications (and not-so-subtle symbolism) of the robotic Civil War?  Intriguing and complicated plot twists?  Rigorous and almost obsessive adherence to the specs of the original cartoon series?  Or ... do you want Sam to get the girl?

Because you can't have both.",1184457600,3,5855,5.120126448893572
1614283,4,B00005JPNO,"The ""Transformers"" concept is of course Japanese, but the origin predates the animated television show that originally aired in the U. S. from 1984 to 1987. The idea actually goes back to the post WWII ""Godzilla"" series. The Japanese were able to turn the big green fellow into a franchise by producing a series of sequels with titles like: ""Godzilla vs ???"" (Mothra, Biallante, Cosmic Monster, King Ghidorah, Magalon, The Smog Monster, etc. etc.). Japanese producers had discovered a universal appeal in combat between a somewhat good monster/ alien and a clearly bad one. Arnold the Barbarian's ""Terminator"" sequels also picked up on this can't miss idea.

Director Michael Bay has latched onto this idea as a way to arrest his career decline. Normally repeated disasters on the scale of ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon"" would result in banishment from Hollywood and a subsequent career making educational films in Des Moines. But somehow Bay was able to convince them to use him for this project. Apparently having crashed and burned (spectacularly) in many of his prior efforts, gave Bay  a fair degree of perspective and he is able to have a lot of self-reflexive fun with ""Transformers""; a goofy film with a lot of stuff that blows up it neat ways and does not take itself nearly as seriously as the original series. In fact it should appeal to ""Godziilla"" fans who find this quasi-parody quality endearing.

In place of Godzilla and Mothra et al,  the film features Computer Generated Transformer toys that contort and expand from something normal into robot monsters. The head monster, who speaks with the voice of Earthquake McGoon, is a bad boy named Megatron. He is the most fearsome of the evil Decepticons robots, who are at odds with the nice robots (Transformers). Both brands of robots have fled the doomed planet Cybertron and came to Earth. There is a fairly explicit reason for their choosing Earth (called the Allspark) but it is not important that casual viewers fully understand the details.

Initially ""Transformers"" is a teen movie, with the familiar loser teen boy (Sam played by Shia LaBeouf) lusting after the hot girl (Mikaela-not the one on ""Star Search"" but Megan Fox who played snobby Carla in ""Confessions of Teenage Drama Queen"") who does not know that he exists. Fox has aged noticeably since ""Drama Queen"" and is fading uncomfortably fast, but she still looks good enough that scorching your eyeballs is a real possibility.

In an attempt of improve Sam's social standing at school (and to advance the storyline), his Dad gets him a Camaro which turns out to be a Transformer named Bumblebee. Having a transforming car causes Mikaela to notice Sam at about the time the film itself transforms from teen movie to battling robot Sci-Fi.

Enter the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) , the armed forces or at least Sgt. Lennox (John Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and a secret agent (Coen Brothers favorite John Turturro). Like the ""Godzilla"" franchise the best efforts of the military make little impression on the robot monsters.

Bay builds up the suspense level as things move toward an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons that will decide the fate of the world. Unfortunately the wheels start to fall off the film at this point as it goes into the ""exercise in excess"" mode of stuff like ""Ultraviolet"" and King Kong"". The Industrial Light and Magic effects are not at fault as their digital creations are first class. There is plenty of attention to detail and the movements and battle sequences are individually excellent. The problem is that the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. A situation that is only tolerable if you begin viewing things from the self-parody angle; which I think was actually Bay's intention all along.

As Roger Ebbert notes: ""The mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on, with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings, and buildings falling into the street, and the military firing, and jets sweeping overhead, and Megatron and the good hero, Optimus Prime, duking it out, and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music, and enough is enough.""

It's really time for these CGI dominated movies to mature and start choreographing their scenes to be more than just eye candy. A logical fight strategy would be nice, something that makes sense and is not just random violence. The ""Transformers"" violence looks like it was lifted from old scripted bouts of ""Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling""; with the combatants often down but never out.

The failure to incorporate logic distances the audience from the action and makes it impossible to build any real suspense. For this reason alone, the film would have benefited from some serious action scene trimming and a more logical assembly in the editing room. Computer animation has become far cheaper than actually staging live-action sequences but audiences are increasingly discounting these scenes-viewer thrills don't happen when viewers are wise enough to see it as animation.  Current audiences are finding it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The same thing occurred in the 1960's when audiences began recognizing the projected backgrounds used for scenes shot in the studio. This started a trend toward shooting films on location with only television shows still using the sound stages.

But this excess is the film's only real fault and since it comes at the end most of the viewing experience is quite enjoyable.

After watching this movie, I thought about joining the armed forces so I could go exact some type of mindless violence on some unsuspecting individual I did not know in some foreign country with an unpronounceable name. Not only am I a fan, I now feel as if my sole mission in life is to educate those individuals who think they are fans, along with those whose first encounter with the Transformers will be this film, as to what they should expect, and more importantly what they should accept. I have traveled around the globe, bid vigorously on eBay, and sacrificed much in an attempt to acquire the toys I need to create the ultimate collection. Not a complete collection, but a collection that will one day, hopefully, be part of a Transformer display of museum quality. I have learned some Japanese, and manipulated 2 of my siblings into learning the language and the culture of the creators so that I might create a seamless conjunction of timelines to aid in my mission; (you may have even read one of their reviews.)

This travesty of a movie was so terrible, I believe many viewers were left in such denial as to be unable to provide rational reviews. Many fans wanted this movie to be so great so badly they must have become delusional, their minds creating the story they wanted to see. I challenge everyone who saw this movie to ask themselves, their friends, what happened during the movie. You will find yourselves drawing a blank. Those who have seen this flick more than once have done so only because subconsciously your trying to fill in the blank. Think about it.

I have, and while I can quote lines from the 1st movie verbatim, I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie other than the scenty, dangly thing hanging on Bumblebee's mirror...you know what I am talking about. Bah weep grahn ah weep ninee bahm. Another issue I have, not just with the movie, is the latest obsession with every Autobot Leader being Optimus Prime, and every Decepticon Leader being Megatron. If you are going to use these names you had d@#m well better put them in the movie. Optimus was a basic rig and Megatron was a gun. And, do not make excuses about mass to size ratios and gun laws. Anyone who has ever seen the Transformers knows that part of their arsenal of advanced technology includes mass shifting and subspace shunts. Their aliens for crying out loud, but they are not bugs. Furthermore, the question everyone should have been asking was ""Where did Optimus Prime's trailer go?"" Not, ""Why does he have a mouth?""

Anybody involved in filmmaking or entertainment knows that a good story always has underlying themes. With the Transformers there were several. The proverbial battle between good and evil, the integration of biblical undertones, the political influence of the time; The Cold War, (why do you think the good guys had blue eyes and the bad guys had red eyes?) Even the names meant something. The name Optimus Prime, for example, is derived from the Latin words for best, and another meaning 1st in occurrence, and Megatron, mega meaning large/great/powerful and tron meaning machine. This movie does not possess any of these aspects. In layman's terms...it suc?ed big time.

Yes, I am a '80s child as well. I watched the cartoons and had the toys. Heck, I still have many of them still in the box; OCD. The whole machine to robot thing has always been awesome. Even now, I have some hope that the sequel will adhere to the spirit of the legend Transformers has become.

The special effects were great, the actors too. Unfortunately, there were too humans and not enough Transformers. The storyline behind this movie blew, and the movie ended with a whimper, not a bang. Too much of this movie was spent on the wrong thing, much like Deep Impact. This movie is supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The plot had massive holes through it, especially in the final scene.

I would strongly recommend that original fans of the 80's cartoon stay away from this movie. In addition, I also recommend that you write to Hasbro and tell them to get it together. If you see it you will be disappointed. The 80s cartoon movie was so much better than this in terms of storyline. Michael Bay is now on my list of most hated directors. Brian Goldner allowed Transformers to be distasteful and obnoxious, though I am not surprised considering his track record and lack of interest in the Transformers until he realized just how much money they can generate.

Why throw away your money so recklessly? That is the question you should ask yourself. Do yourself a favor...rent it. 'Till all are one.",1184284800,24,4632,4.697044334975369
1614309,4,B00005JPNO,"I've never been so angry after seeing a movie. I really, really wanted to hate Transformers. I was ready to pan it with every negative word I could muster. After all, it's a Michael Bay film. Pearl Harbor was bad beyond imagination. The Island was best left undiscovered. And Armageddon was well, a big mess.

With that, you can imagine how I was ready to unload with both barrels on Bay's latest film. Imagine my complete and utter frustration when I came to realize that I actually liked the movie.

Transformers is a summer action film which is clearly aimed at a testosterone-driven audience. I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I screened the film in a theatre filled with local soldier boys, geeks, dweebs, and their pals who came to see lots of explosions and hear bad dialogue. Indeed, they got their money's worth.

There's a lot to hate about Transformers. It's long, and it's loud. It appeals to nearly every conceivable alpha male stereotype with sexy girls, anti-gay jokes, masturbation quips, and at least two incidents where urination is used for the sake of humor. My, how we've come in a society where bathroom jokes are the norm.

The action scenes are difficult to follow, and when the robots are fighting, it's just a blur of explosions and metal. There's not a lot of motivation for the evil Decepticons, either. They're just evil. And they like to blow stuff up. I always wondered why the Autobots never could fly in the cartoons. It would have been more of a fair fight. I still wonder about that.

The robots' dialogue is simply horrible. The Decepticons were never able to master English, which is a good thing. At least we only had to read the subtitles when they deliver their atrocious lines. The Autobots, on the other hand, were able to learn our language ""on the World Wide Web.""

Transformers is a 144-minute commercial. No, wait. It's three commercials in one: 1) the Hasbro toy line (After all, the opening credits list Hasbro as a financer for the film), 2) General Motors, especially the new Chevrolet Camaro (Notice that all of the Autobots (except Optimus Prime) are from the GM line, and the Decepticon police car is an evil Ford Mustang), and 3) the Army (they need to recruit new folks for Iraq, you know).

Put simply, Transformers is garbage. But it's good garbage. It never takes itself too seriously, and is clearly marketed for those of us who have a limited attention span. Even with so much to hate, I still liked the movie. Oh, how I wish I could hate it. I wanted to hate it. But I just couldn't!

After all, gosh darn it, I'm a fan. The movie somehow... miraculously... appealed to my inner twelve-year-old. Even as bad as Optimus Prime's dialogue was, Peter Cullen's voice was enough to make me believe in him again. ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings,"" he said. Heck, he even repeats a line that's from the 1987 animated film. No, I'm not telling you which one.

The story revolves around this ancient cube from Cybertron called the Allspark. Apparently, it would turn our own technology against us, so the Autobots have to find it before the treacherous Decepticons do. The only one who has the key to find it is a teenage boy named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Sam is the typical smartaleck kid who has just gotten his first car. It's LaBeouf that shines as the overall star of the film, and might even outshine the robots themselves.

The first act of the movie revolves around the fact that Sam's 1979 Chevrolet Camaro is actually a robot in disguise called Bumblebee (sorry fanboys, he's not a VW Beetle). In a nod to the cartoon, there's a yellow beetle right next to Bumblebee in the car lot where Sam and his dad are to buy his first car. Bumblebee is heroic, and apparently has earned the respect and admiration of the much larger Optimus Prime. He also shows the most depth of character of any of the robots.

There are plenty of cardboard characters in Transformers, especially the ones played by Josh Duhamel, Jon Voight, and John Turturro. The only reason they're there is to ooh and ah at the robots, and of course, serve as moving targets. The second and third acts of the film are much more explosive, and they serve well to pump testosterone through the hearts of teenagers (and eternal teenagers) everywhere.

Now if you're not a teenage boy (or a boy trapped in a man's body) that's ready to check their brain and any semblance of plausibility at the door, then stay far, far away from Transformers. The rest of us can have a good time.

There are plenty of us out there who grew up with the Transformers, which is what Dreamworks is counting on. This movie brings them to life like only Michael Bay can, with enough decibels to deafen a boom box. That is, unless the boom box is a transformer. Oh, there's that too.

1614310,3,B00005JPNO,"I give this movie an in between rating due to it not being the perfect live action Transformers movie. It was enjoyable, but as usual, there will be some problems for die hard fans. For one thing, were we watching Transformers or Humans with the Autobots and Decepticons only as co-stars? The main reason mostly everybody wanted to see this movie was to see the Transformers more than humans. Oh well, how exactly do you make a live action Transformers movie anyhow?  The obligatory Michael Bay slow motion/dramatic musical score playing scenes were a little annoying. I'll watch Armageddon if I wanted to see that.

I'll have to agree with Time magazine that the human characters did get in the way. However, when the main focus was on stage, it was a return to a childhood bliss: Big robots fighting to protect or destroy! Hearing the voice of Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) once again made me want to hold my old toys as I watched this. Knowing that Bumblebee (this time looking better and less annoying) wanted to have the lead female role on his hood making out with the ""Spike"" character was great! I liked that change!
""Bumblebee, stop lubricating on the Human!""

 The Decepticons were not the diabolicaly evil robots that TF fans loved to see. They were kinda boring and had no character what so ever. I think you only hear three of them talk (not counting Frenzy). Could've used more of the Megatron and Starscream conflict.

Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch. The action was great, but it was hard to tell what was going on during some scenes when the Autobots finally fought thier long time enemys. Darn shakey camera effect!

Bottomline: Watch this to see a live action 2007 version of our beloved 1980s toy franchise with great special effects. It might make fans and non fans feel empty handed at the end though wanting scenes reduced and more of the big robots.",1184284800,,1880,4.647590361445783
1614311,4,B00005JPNO,"I never thought these words would ever come out from my lips, but here it is: Michael Bay is the perfect guy for this kind of movie.  After growing up with the Transformers in the 80's, and hearing that Bay would be helming the big screen adaptation, I cringed to say the least.  However, any reservations I had were put to rest upon seeing the Bay directed and Steven Spielberg produced mega budget adaptation of the long running Hasbro toy line, which provides everything you look for in a mainstream action movie and then some.  Rising star Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a high school nerd trying to woo a hottie (Megan ""the"" Fox) and soon learns that his newly bought classic Camero is a robot in disguise (sorry, couldn't help it) named Bumblebee, and that two warring robot alien races are here on Earth searching for the all powerful All Spark.  I don't want to spoil any more of the surprisingly inventive story, which features the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by legendary returning voice actor Peter Cullen, and also featuring Bumblebee, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet) taking on the evil Decepticons led by Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving and also featuring Starscream, Blackout, Barricade, Scorponok, Frenzy, Devestator, and Bonecrusher) with all of humanity in the middle.  The ridiculous amount of CGI-generated action and stunt work is where Bay is right at home, and they are truly where the film shines.  What hurts Transformers though is the amount of human elements that are injected and disposed of rather quickly.  Case in point is a sub-plot involving a hacker (Anthony Anderson) and a specialist (Rachel Taylor) who are supposed to play pivotal roles, than vanish.  Despite some disappointing elements, Transformers is a winner regardless, and features some of the most brilliant CGI effects you will ever see.  Whether you're a longtime fan who grew up with the classic 80's cartoon and toys, or just an action movie junkie, you can guarantee that you will never, ever, be bored with watching Transformers.  Also featuring Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and a funny small role from Bernie Mac.",1184198400,,2153,4.972144846796658
1614312,4,B00005JPNO,"When I saw the first preview for ""Transformers"", the new film directed by Michael Bay (""Armageddon"", ""The Rock""), I was less than impressed. ""Gee, they are using CGI to animate giant robots based on a popular line of toys. They're invading Earth"". Yawn. But with each new preview, and it seems like I saw hundreds, my interest grew. Each new preview provided a glimpse of a new part of the film, something that could be really exciting. So, it comes at great surprise to realize ""Transformers"" could end up being one of my favorite films of the summer.

Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf, ""Disturbia"", ""Surf's Up"", ""Indiana Jones 4"") is a nerdy Junior in high school. In his history class, he manages to embarrass himself in front of Mikaela (Megan Fox), the prettiest girl in school, by trying to sell some old family heirlooms; a pair of glasses his grandfather was wearing when he made a great discovery at the North Pole in the early Twentieth Century. Sam is trying to raise some money; his dad (Kevin Dunn) has promised to help him buy a car if he raises half of the money and earns 4 As. They end up buying an old, beaten up Camaro, but Sam is drawn to the car, it seems to speak to him, to help him out in times of need. Meanwhile, in Qatar, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel, TV's ""Las Vegas"") is getting ready to come home when an unidentified helicopter approaches the base. As soon as it lands, it transforms into a large robot and wreaks havoc with the base. Its goal? To hack into the defense system of the United States and steal as much information as possible. Captain Lennox and his men manage to escape. Back home, the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) is concerned about the hack and enlists a number of civilian specialists. The only thing they were able to retrieve was a strange signal. Just as Maggie (Rachel Taylor), a civilian enlisted by the government to help, is about to figure out what the signal is, she realizes they are hacking into the system again. Soon, Sam's Camaro transforms into Bumblebee, a member of a small group of Transformers called the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced the character in the original television series), who were sent to Earth to prevent Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving, Agent Smith in ""The Matrix, V in ""V for Vendetta"") and the rest of the Decepticons from retrieving the All Spark, a large cube containing enormous power; Megatron wants to use the cube to destroy, Optimus Prime wants to destroy the cube to keep it out of evil hands. Soon, all of the humans are engaged in a battle to stop Megatron and his evil associates and Sam finds himself smack dab in the middle.

Directed by Michael Bay, produced by Steven Spielberg and starring the new It Kid in Hollywood (La Beouf), ""Transformers"" is surprisingly good. Anytime Spielberg is attached to a project, it is generally a safe bet he will ensure at least an entertaining film, but even he has had a share of misfires and I feared this might be such an occasion. But Bay reigns in his once infamous rapid-fire editing and concentrates more on story and character than special effects. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of special effects, and they are great, but in ""Transformers"", he spends a significant amount of screen time on character and story development, making the film better, richer and more detailed than you might expect.

I was dubious about a film based on a popular toy of the 80s, fearing it was just an effort to relaunch the brand. Hasbro is one of the first names listed in the credits and it probably will help relaunch the toy to a new generation, but the toys are brought to life by some great special effects. When we see Sam's yellow Camaro transform into Bumblebee for the first time, we believe it. And the transformation is fast, and seems very fluid, giving us a feeling of what will come. Everything in ""Transformers"" moves fast, amping up the action and the danger. If Bumblebee can transform this quickly, Megatron and all of the evil Decepticons will have the same power. Also, these robots move fast, at one point seeming to skate after each other down a busy freeway, the Decepticons crushing any and all vehicles in their way.

Sam is your typical teenager; he wants a car and he wants a girl. He is disappointed to learn all he can really afford is a beaten-up Camaro, but any car is better than none at all, so as soon as the car is his, he takes great pride in it. When he and a buddy take the car out for a drive, they approach the jocks and other cool kids at a nearby lake. Mikaela is clearly having trouble relating to her jock boyfriend and walks off alone. Sam views this as an opportunity and offers her a ride. She accepts and the car seems to realize Sam needs a little help because it plays music to help Sam woo his dream girl. Later, an extended scene when Sam is trying to keep Mikaela and the Autobots hidden from his parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) leads to some laughs but also helps to establish all of these characters.

As the story progresses, we learn more and more about Sam's grandfather and how this ties into the rest of the story. It is a nice touch and helps the story immeasurably, given it an air of authenticity. Yes, I know we are talking about a movie in which giant robots do battle, but this back-story helps make the whole thing seem more realistic.

From the first appearance of Captain Lennox (Duhamel), we learn about his wife and child and this helps to explain why he is so determined to stay alive.

It is also nice to see Voigt's Secretary of Defense listen to civilians and take action quickly. So often in these big budget action films, the government officials ignore any and all advice, acting like stupid morons. I'm not sure which performance is closer to the truth (I have my suspicions!) but it just seems to make more sense for these people to listen to people in a time of crisis.

A number of actors pop up in small roles, giving the film little injections of humor and levity. Bernie Mac plays the used car salesman who sells the Camaro to Sam and his dad. John Turturro pops up as a mysterious agent in a mysterious division of the government. These roles help to add spice to the already well-written and well-made film, giving it another layer of depth and interest.

As the film progresses and more and more of the Transformers come to life, morphing into their robot selves, you quickly realize you are in for more, something different from just a toy tie-in movie. As mentioned previously, the robots move really fast and this helps to hold our interest. We never know when something new or exciting will pop up. In one scene, one of the Transformers becomes a jet and flies through the air, twirling around and quickly becomes his robot persona, before landing on the war-torn streets of Los Angeles, ready to engage in battle. The film contains a number of action sequences I think I will remember for some time. Particularly impressive are the scenes in which a Decepticon attacks the Army base in Qatar and a chase down a Los Angeles freeway.

Michael Bay, who became a bit of a stereotype for his use of over-editing in his last few films (See ""Armageddon"" for an example of this), manages to tone it down a bit. He actually lingers on shots long enough for us to see them and to identify them and to experience what they are experiencing. It is almost refreshing to see Bay slow down a bit, because it makes the action in the film all the more believable, interesting and fun to watch.

Bay does manage to sneak in a few of what I'll call his signature ""American Fabric"" shots. In one scene, two characters are laying together in an embrace on top of their car. The camera lingers across them, as the sky behind is a deep orange, indicating a summer sunset. He does this a few times in most of his films to show how `ordinary' the characters are and to make their impending danger or the danger they just faced successfully all the more real. But the director does manage to forgo one trademark of these shots; the American Flag isn't waving in the background. This one element just makes these shots a little too `on the nose', a little too hokey for their own good.

""Transformers"" isn't perfect. Initially, when the Transformers communicate, we see their language on screen, a weird alphabet made up of strange symbols, quickly translated into English subtitles. But later, they begin to speak, using a monotone deep bass. It is difficult for a large robot to show emotion and when they are using a fairly stereotypical robot type of delivery, it doesn't help them become any more personable. Even the Autobots, the good guys, seem stiff when they are given voice and begin discussing the state of the battle. They express empathy for the humans, but this technique just doesn't work. I never watched the television show, or played with the toys, and I understand they had voices in the show, but the filmmakers should have stuck to the subtitles.

Also, as in most summer blockbusters, the ending is overblown. Both divisions of the Transformers wage battle against one another in the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. Of course, Sam and Mikaela are in the center of things, as are Captain Lennox and his men and the rest of the secret division of the government. Some of the stunts and the action are impressive, but it goes on too long. They literally have to chase Sam up to the top of a building, putting him in danger of falling to the ground, as if the missiles, gunshots and 30 foot robots falling to the ground weren't dangerous enough.

""Transformers"" is a lot of fun and is one of the most enjoyable summer action films I have seen in a long time.",1184198400,,9717,4.541976013706454
1614313,3,B00005JPNO,"I enjoyed this film. I like big robots fighting. Still though, this was not Transformers. Michael Bay is perhaps a notch or two above Brian DePalma. He is a corporate director. A yes man. A suit, not a creative. He manages to cobble his films together and throw so much SFX and WHAPOW at you that you can easily forget you are being fooled with smoke and mirrors. The standard skinny nameless chick with the jeans 1/2 an inch above her fancy place is standard fare in his films. This confuses most men. ""The Island"" was his best and even that, although done well, was cobbled together from many other sources. Michael Bay should be working at ILM doing nothing but car chases and battle scenes. This is where he is at his best. Beyond that he could not tell a moving story with a soul to save his life.

Since I knew all this about him I went to see this film with my 6 year old son who I know does not have adult standards. We enjoyed it greatly. How can you tell your son you thought a film was no good when he is enjoying it soooo much. You cant. Well perhaps you can but I can't. I just went to where he was and enjoyed it as he did. I also like robots fighting. I think I mentioned that already. Not everything needs to be ""Lawrence of Arabia"", Lord of the Rings"", or even ""Three's Company"". Some things are just stupid with robots and explosions and that's all there is.  It is too bad because at some point back in the day it was possible to see a BLOCKBUSTER that was a great film too. Transformers could have been that. It could have kept all the things the fans of the TV show loved and been updated just enough for todays kids to make a very well rounded film. It was not. But it was still fun.

I think one of the biggest problems is the new guys. You know who you are. These are the new writers, artists, and producers who when given the chance to take and old property and make a film, always choose to alter, change, augment, and re-write to make the film their own. It's nonsense. That is why I say it's NOT Transformers. Too many cooks spoil the broth. Megatron? Where was he? Was that bizarre Gundam looking thing/bot supposed to be him? As Borat would say...NOT! Batman Begins was the only example I can think of where the film was made to satasfy fans, not some corporate big wig who wants Bumblebee to play abig role because he read that name in some industry synopsis. Bumblebee was the worst Autobot I had as a kid. My dog would not even play with him. Sure now they made him cool but there were many other already cool robots to choose from. Where were they?

Well i could go on and on but for Michael Bay I refuse. My son liked the film and I enjoyed that he enjoyed it. I like robots fighting too, I'm simple that way.

hopefully they will not give Michale Bay GI Joe. Hopefully they will make a decent land of the Lost film. Hopefully they will make a good Bionic Man film. I doubt it but I can hope. Once in a while Hollywood manages to slip a few good blockbusters past the goalie by accident, simply because they do not know what they are looking at.

Did I mention I like robots fighting?

1614314,4,B00005JPNO,"I grew up in the 80's watching the battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron, so this movie was a long-awaited trip back into childhood.  I always loved the cartoon as a kid, so of course I'm a little biased.  But I also had a lot of concerns about this movie going in, mainly because it's a Michael Bay movie and we all know about some of his well-know flops.

Simply put: I loved it.  It was exactly what I was expecting and pretty much what I wanted to see.

Some positives from the movie: visuals, storyline, acting, action, humor.

Some negatives: storyline, acting

I put storyline and acting as both positivies and negatives because there were parts of both that I enjoyed and also thought could have been improved.

Shia Labeouf was perfect in his role as Sam.  He's the funny, corny, nerdy kid that played perfectly opposite his CGI colleagues.  Megan Fox brought some great sexuality and sassiness opposite Shia, while Josh Duhamel brought some nice grittiness as an Army Captain caught up in the fight.

Jon Voight plays that stereotypical Secretary of Defense.  His performance was pretty nondescript.  You could have put Sam Elliot or any number of similar personalities and gotten the same reaction to the character.  Also, I'm usually a John Turturro fan, but I wasn't into his character this time.  I understand how they wrote the character, but between him and the director, the character came off as oaffish and silly.

As for the transformers themselves, I thought their ""personalities"" were very well done.  A great mix of humor, seriousness, and even desperation.  The body-language given to the robot characters was very convincing, especially Bumblebee, who remained voiceless throughout the film until the end.

The storyline was about what I expected and I enjoyed it.  Things obviously could have been tweaked, there were a few holes here and there (some Decepticons disappeared at the end without any resolution), but overall, the storyline was great for a summer action blockbuster.  Great mixture of humor, drama, and action.

As for visuals....wow.  The Transformers looked great, moved great, interacted great.  I was thoroughly impressed by every aspect of the CGI work.  When Optimus Prime first rolled in and transformed, I found myself, along with everyone else in the theator, clapping in approval.  A childhood hero was finally reborn on the big screen.

And I think a new generation of transformers fans will be born out of this movie.  I hope they follow through with the hints at a sequel.",1184198400,,2529,4.9429928741092635

I reccomend anyone that likes action movies or transformers to go see it.  Heck!  Just go see it to watch giant metal robots fighting eachother in all its loud glory!  I have to admit, this movie really makes you feel like you are right there and giant robots are actually fighting in front of you.  People may complain saying this movie is too much action, it isn't ""art"" or whatever, but I think that this movie is 100% art.  I mean the artists who made the robots come to life is purely amazing.  This movie is not to be taken seriously.

Shia LaBeouf's character, Sam, was endearingly awkward to the point that I often covered my face in embarassment! He was great in the movie and very convincing.

And it has been the best two hours of this summer.

The biggest treat... the special effects.  These were simply amazing!  It has now gotten to the point where it is difficult to tell what is computer generated and what isn't.  Seeing a car, truck, helicopter, jet, cell phone, and CD-radio transform was so realistic looking I don't think I'll be looking at anything that runs on electricity the same again for a while.  This has now raised the bar on what to expect from movies in this department.

The story was pretty decent, too.  It seems a lot of nostalgic-inspired movies have some of the worst story lines but they actually put together something that made sense.  The story will often ruin a movie for me and this was where I thought my biggest disappointment would lie.  I'm happy to report very little disappointment here.

The pace seemed perfect.  I'd love to give the writers a round of applause for this.  It started with some nice action then gave you a break, brought on some more action, then gave you a break.  The movie was pretty much like this which is always nice.  While I loved the action it was nice to have a few scenes where I could catch my breath and enjoy some of the humor they had to offer.  The breaks are good because sitting clinched in your seat for two hours is often tiring.  This movie kept you on the edge of your seats but let you sit back now and then and watch the characters get developed.

Speaking of characters, I loved the ones in this movie.  Shia LaBeouf did a great job of bringing the human element into this movie (another concern of mine was that this would be the story of waring robots).  Every person in this movie had their own personality to add and it was great to see nobody up-stagging somebody else.  Even each robot had their own personality which added a great mix of variety and humor to the show.

If I had any disappointment it would be in the love story aspect of this movie.  I understand why they have the love interest in a story (attract a wider demographic, bring some down time to the action, help make you care about the main characters) but these two people had as much odds in hooking up in real life as an elephant and a peacock.  I mean, seriously, not only was she so much out of his league, not only was she too superficial to find somebody like him attractive, not only did they have nothing in common, but NOTHING seemed to want me to see those two hook up at the end.... or anything.  The romance in this movie was just so unrealistic, laughable, and downright horrible.  They could have done so much better.  They could have chosen a better girl.  A girl-next-door type of girl where we would fall in love with her personality and not her body and we would actually love to see her match up with the lead character.

If you love high-action, special-effects-driven movies then you need to catch this movie on the big screen.  Don't wait for it to come on DVD.  Watch it now and buy the DVD later for more enjoyment.  I can't wait until this hits HD-DVD, it will most definitely be added to my collection.",1184112000,3,3284,4.3841059602649

1614341,3,B00005JPNO,"Two things I have to point out. One, it's rare I go to see a movie in its first theater run- there's way too much crap out there, so it takes something exceptional to draw me. And two, I watch Michael Bay movies even less, if that's possible. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Transformers."" To repeat the obvious, it's the type of movie that matches Bay's visual and directorial style. And I didn't go into this movie expecting ""The Godfather"" or ""Citizen Kane."" I loved the original run cartoon and when I'd heard the movie was based on that series of the cartoon, I was there! It's action from the start- the fastest movie for an over 2 hour flick I've ever watched. That's thanks to the almost non-stop action. You can't have a story based on ""Transformers"" without that. The characters are revealed appropriately, as the story unfolds at a necessary pace. And though the movie doesn't fully incorporate the story line from the medium it's based on, there's enough winks at the camera in the dialogue that allows the cartoon's long standing fandom to have an arcane chuckle or two. On the other hand, there is stuff tossed into the script that plays too much to casual and contemporary fans, and comes up lame. There's spots of contemporary jargon, perhaps one or two force fed characters mainly due to the actor's appeal, and the fight sequences, particularly the final one, where because of the pace of the action it's a little hard to determine who's fighting who. It would seem if there were any time for an oft criticized Bay trademark, it would be in those scenes where a little slow motion action might make more sense. His trademark obligatory, sacreligious landmark destruction fits better within the context of this movie. Several characters really click in this movie. John Turturro and Jon Voight are great in somewhat uncharacteristic roles. Shiah LaBeoufe and the gum swallowing gorgeous Megan Fox, the pair the movie evolves around,  are well cast. To Bay's credit, Fox is utilized  more than just gratuitous eye-fluff, though she is that indeed. But that leads me to my one disappointment, which is different from most other's I've heard. I realize going from TV to the big screen, a movie cannot include all the elements from the show, even moreso in a movie like ""Transformers."" But a great chunk of the original running cartoon's appeal came from the battle within the ranks within the Deceptacon, making Starscream one of the cartoon's most outstanding and hilarious characters (he is in the movie, but at a minimum and seemingly to toss the long time fans a bone.) In fact, a greater percentage of the cartoon evolved around the robots and dialogue between them creating more depth to their characters. The humans were a necessary background. Within the plot of this movie it would seem that should be the case, but that's not how it's executed. Necessarily, the movie evolves around human interaction. To do otherwise would be leaning away from the feel of a traditional movie and more towards a Pixar direction, perhaps catering to a different audience as a result. But I'm simply noting that in doing so, some well liked elements of the story will be lost. That doesn't take away from the direction chosen for ""Transfomers."" It is a very entertaining movie that flies by. It's just that it will have a different appeal for many members of the audience.",1184025600,,3379,4.7941680960548885

1614343,3,B00005JPNO,"As a person who normally despises the trite, gratuitously shallow film making of Michael Bay, I was in an uproar when I read that his name was attached to the fiming of the new Transformers ""live action"" movie.

As a Transformer fan since the age of 7, and also someone who has followed the franchise on and off ever since, I thought the whole thing would be a travesty.

Sure I've seen a few decent films by Bay like The Rock, but I knew him as someone who basically thought of dialogue as a porn director does, pure fluff and filler.

Now going to the theater to see this I knew that I could be very dissapointed. I also knew though, that the movie had a few things going for it though, specifically, Steven Spielberg Exec producing, and Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime (as with the original animated movie and series).

What I did finally get to see was actually quite a surprise, as the film didn't totally bite the big one as expected.

Sure its no ""Citizen Kane"" but it remains faithful to the original series, comic and movie (not to mention toyline) more than I expected.

For one thing, I and others (even on this site) believe that Spielberg had a lot more to do with this than credits show. It is well known that Spielberg ""ghost directed"" some of the dialogue scenes in Star Wars Revenge of the Sith, and that was one of the things that made that movie rise above the other prequels in many ways. It is pretty obvious the the middle third of the movie is likely Spielberg directing, because the dialogue and acting is much better than the other two thirds! Also, some of the plot reminds me of ET, and even Batteries Not Included in some ways.

Now on to the acting. Shia Lebouf couldn't have played a better Spike...I mean Sam Witwicky, down to the close relationship with Bumblebee (though Bumblebees being partly mute was a corny idea on likely Spielberg's part), to his ackward teenage reactions to love interest Mikaela Banes. His performance raises the bar in what would have been your usual ""blockbuster"" garbage considerably.
He looks very close to the animated Spike Witwicky, down to even facial expressions and body language!
 Megan Fox (Mikaela) however does little for the movie than to provide additional eye candy for the teenage boy in all of us, her performance being very wooden and one dimensional.

Jon Voigt does a decent job as the Secretary of Defense, and John Tuturro hams it up as a overzealous FBI agent who captures Bumblebee (ok seem familiar already?).

The real star of the show though, and the reason why I actually went to see the flick is Peter Cullen.

Peter Cullen is the original Optimus Prime, and its with his faithful and heartfelt performance that steals the show this time. The other Autobots and Decepticons served as little more than space filler (in this film), but Cullen's John Wayneesque Prime is what probably raised the original series above your average ""Go-Bots"" or ""Thundercats"". From the classic ""freedom is the right of every sentient being"" to ""roll out!"" to ""One shall stand, one shall fall"", he delivered every line like it was still 1986, with complete conviction.

Authenticity to the original source material?

Surprisingly close. The ""All Spark"" was first mentioned in Beast Wars, and they seem to combine this concept with ""Vector Sigma"" (original series) with a more mythical twist.

Megatron's story is actually quite similar to the character ""Jetfire""'s story from the original series (frozen in Arctic, etc).
Overall, its as if they took various characters and elements from the original show and mixed them in a pot and saw what they could come up with.

""Frenzy"" is basically a pastische of ""Kremzeek"", ""Ravage"" and ""Soundwave"" from the original show (with a Spielberg twist), and creates comic relief without being a Jar Jar Binks.

In fact, much of the movie is very light hearted and comedic, even when during serious battles *something Ebert enjoyed about it). Its not a cynical or ironic humor per se, but it makes the journey a bit more fun than if played straight (again likely Spielberg and not Bay).
The original series had plenty of humor, whether dealing with cloned Primes, hiliarious one liners, or decepticons getting drunk on Energon cubes!

The downsides? There are many. Some of the (human) acting is pretty ridiculous, and some of the action gets long winded (ok I forgot momentarily that Michael Bay directed this). Also, the Decepticons don't have the depth that the Autobots do. I thought that it was almost reversed in the original series, as you saw a cold and calculating Soundwave, a more pragmatic but power hungry Starscream, and a domineering Megatron. All of these elements were played in tandem against the other and made for some great entertainment.

The Decepticons in here, though they look menacing (not to mention dark), don't have the chemistry (or even enough lines) than the original series and movie gave them. One line is devoted to Starscream's rivalry with Megatron, and this seemed forced just to please the fans.

Hugo Weaving does a perfunctory job as Megatron, but one wishes that Frank Welker would've been picked. However hammy that Welker got with Megatron, it would've been cooler to hear the voice of the original Megatron (who in the original series almost acted like a Bond villian, something Welker was likely going for).

So to conclude, did this satisfy the childhood dream of a Transformers live action movie? Yes and no. It left a lot to be desired, but at least it kept many of the original elements intact, didn't add too many elements to try to modernize it or diminish the original source material (lets face it, many of the moviegoers won't understand many of the references made and homages done, not to mention some of the plotpoints that are there for hardcore fans). If Transformers was a half hour toy commercial, this is a two hour one, but with guilt I found myself enjoying both the original series and this movie, flaws and warts and all.

It has much of the imagination that the original series had, and that's worth more than a thousand half hour ""toy commercials"".

Oh and btw, the reviewer who says that ""Soundwave shouldn't be a sand crab"" has it all wrong. Scorponok (the character's name), has always been a scorpion or crab of some sort.

And finally, not to give it away, but it all clicked just now. The Decepticons goal was to use a planet like Earth (with the ""All Spark"") to create the largest Decepticon ever (with all its life and technology together)- possibly an indication Unicron is going to be in one of the next films?",1183939200,2,6610,4.7486910994764395

At first the viewer thinks that these are some evil machines out of a Stephen King movie and then you realize (like in Terminator 2) that there are good ones and bad ones.

The special effects are amazing and the story and characters are pretty good too.

If you went to see the movie, expecting it to be exactly like the TV show, you're a complete and total idiot. No movie is ever like the book/TV show it's based off of. It's a fact of life.
There were many, many great things about this movie that made it awesome.
First of all, the actors.
Some of the actors were unrecognizable, and those you'd seen before became completely new characters. Like Shia LaBeouf. I've seen him so many times in Even Stevens and Holes, but this Shia was so much different from those characters. I really wish they could have developed his character a little more, but I guess that would be asking for too much, especially since this movie was about 2.5 hours long, maybe more.
The plot was great, and made complete sense. It was a little slow at first, and took awhile before the Autobots showed up, but it was all worth it in the end.
The effects were absolutely amazing. I didn't know that we were yet capable of such amazing graphics, and the actors did wonderfully when they were with the robots. The action scenes were so intense I had to chew mouthfuls of popcorn. You could feel the entire theater shake when one of the robots fell.
Not least of all was the comedy. This movie had an amazing mix of comedy and action. There weren't a lot of times when jokes were used, at least not enough to make this movie more of a comedy than an action movie. There were enough so the movie wasn't dark and depressing.

To sum it all up, I liked-
The action
The acting
The graphics/effects
The humor
The plotline

I disliked-
The mysteriousness of where the robots were from and why they were robots. I hope they expand on that in the sequel.
The low character development.

Also, I would like to say I'm not a fan of the TV show.",1183852800,2,1837,4.334302325581396

1614348,3,B00005JPNO,"I was not raised on 'Transformers' but on the cartoons of the 70's, so I am not really familiar with the robotic characters in this film, until now. As an original movie, it is better than all those sequels we have been force fed over the last couple months. I am also not a big fan of Michael Bay (his 'Armageddon' might make my 20 worst movies of all time). But I was impressed with his treatment of some of the human characters (Sam, Mikaela, Sam's parents, Defense Secretary, and the first military survivors), and that is saying a lot for Bay's working with actors. As for the robots themselves, as usual the effects were top notch. The main problem with the film (I don't think I need to go into some of the plots that didn't make any sense, nor some of the characters that weren't necessary for the film to work) was the action between the robots. The fighting was so quickly edited, it was difficult to tell who was fighting whom, and who was winning. I wouldn't recommend slow-motion (that would cheapen the film), but I would've recommended the filmmakers shoot the sequences so that we could see, close-up, what was actually happening. To me, it seemed that a pile of scrap metal was fighting another pile of scrap metal. The scenes could have been greatly improved. In 'Aliens', James Cameron wisely turned off the music during the final sequence when Ripley is dueling with the mother alien. You can hear the clanging of the loader and the squeeching of the alien - no music assists. In Spielberg's own 'Jurassic Park', during the scene where the t-rex is after the children in the car, there is no music (this was suggested by composer John Williams, not by Spielberg). Only sounds of the t-rex, the children's screams, and the crushing of metal from the vehicle. Both films were more effective because the bombastic music was isolated from the action. It made the films that much more frightening, and personal (as if you were right there with the alien or t-rex). Maybe Bay (and exec producer Spielberg) should have thought of this when the robots were fighting each other in the streets (what city was this anyway??? And how many people were killed? Thousands???). Instead, he has loud music playing over loud explosions playing over noises that may or may not be the sounds of clanging metal bodies when the robots fall. These might be some of the most important sequences in the film, and Bay drops the ball by handling this battle as some sort of silly and noisy 'rockem sockem robots' tournament. Too bad. Since this movie was supposed to be about alien robots, give the audience a reason to care about what happens to them. Though 'Optimus Prime' has a lot to preach about, I don't really care what happens to him. It's not words that make us care, but 'actions'. Maybe if he HAD given his life... And 'Megatron' should have been much more sinister, ala Darth Vader ('Sam' could have been 'Luke' and 'Megatron' could have been 'Vader' - at the end). Unfortunately the script is so weak in story and the robots have mostly shallow characters, the movie fails to live up to all the hype. While many of the human actors were up to the task, the robots were not. If you are interested in seeing a good story about mechanical robots, watch the animated 'The Iron Giant', directed by Brad Bird ('Ratatouille').",1183852800,5,3326,4.629441624365482

1614383,3,B00005JPNO,"Who writes the scripts for the movies nowadays?  Whatever happened to quality?
The original transformers were robots we could identify with or want to be, perhaps in our evil dreams.  Megatron, the bully.  Optimus Prime the father figure.  Bumblebee, our best freind.  And of course spike represented the only major human involved in the original story, which probably represented most kids which were watching the show.
I found this movie to be extremely pro military (particular pro US military, as apparently the transformers don't seem to interact with any other military in the world except for ours).  Nice reference implying China and Russia as potential enemies (along with N Korea and Iran).
Makes you begin to wonder if this was another one of those propaganda films that the US media keeps on churning out these days.
There are also some things in the movie that didn't make sense.  The mighty megatron was defeated, unrealistically by a human (or at least in an unrealistic manner).  And the other transformers were of course easily beaten by small arms fire.  You would think that robots that flew through space and crashed into earth would be made of sterner stuff.  But nope, they can survive being hits hundreds of miles per hour by ordinary space particles, but apparently can't handle special type of ammunition used in small guns.
The original transformers were also amazingly strong, capable of lifting tens of tons.  but apparently, in this movie, they were easily handled by a few helicopters.
I guess some people did enjoy this movie.  And those people that did, enjoyed it for different reasons then perhaps what certain other people were looking for.  I thought the CGI was great - but everything else was either unnecessary or didn't make sense.  Producers and directors need to stop making films they want to make (or make them and stop putting franchise labels on them).  If you are going to continue a franchise, like the transformers, then make a movie that does honor to the original series.  Don't make the movie you want to make just to sell toys or whatever, and then slap the word transformers in the title.",1183852800,2,2142,4.89196675900277
1614384,3,B00005JPNO,"I'm sorry to say it because I was really looking forward to it, but I was very disappointed with ""Transformers,"" and I'm actually a big Michael Bay fan!  He gets a lot of flack as a director, but I think he is top-notch at what does.  No, not because he makes great films, but because he makes great ACTION films.  They may be dumb, but they look great and always have better, rock `em, sock `em, blow-you-through-the-back-wall-of-the-theater action and stunt sequences than the competition.  Considering what he did with the buddy (""Bad Boys"", ""The Rock"") and disaster genres (""Armageddon"" - again, dopey, but it looked great), I was really looking forward to seeing what he could do with $200 mil to have giant robots beat the livin' s**t out of each other.

But, alas, ""Transformers"" just kind of sat there on the screen for me.  It was not for a lack of stuff blowing up or any of Bay's usual trademarks, but this film felt more generic than some of his other testosterone fests.  Maybe it's because of all the CGI use in the action scenes instead of being able to film actual car chases and shoot-outs with real cars and stunt people the way he normally does.

I dunno, but ""Transformers"" had an air of ""seen this before"" to it.  The movie was okay and for the most part entertaining, but I was not blown away by any of the action sequences the way I thought I would be in this, surely Bay's biggest film to date. They look the same way a lot of these big, SCI-FI, CG action sequences look.

Also they were often just a big blur.  The robots weren't distinguishable enough from one another during the battle sequences, which themselves were chopped and cut in a far too spastic fashion. Between these two flaws, you often you could not tell what the hell was going on; which character was victorious or who was hurt, etc.

And my God, so much of the dialog and teen-centric baboonery was just plain corny.  Now, I know Bay is reaching for a wider and perhaps younger audience, or maybe trying to recapture the tone of the cartoon source material, so I guess that may explain the corny dialogue and cheesy plot elements (not that that makes it any less groan-inducing), but the action is what this film should be about, and for all its big set pieces, noise and feverish cuts, it never got me all rah-rah the way it was obviously trying to.  I never felt like I was really rooting for anyone or was in any kind of suspense about the outcome.  Stuff blows up really good, but that's about it.  Its fun for a while, but it gets old-hat pretty quickly when they just keep throwin' another F/X shot up on the screen that looks just like the last one to keep the audience Oooo-ing and Ahhh-ing.  And the movie drags on too long.

I will say this though, the Transformers, as designed, look great (though I sympathize with the purist fans who are upset that the makers did not stay true to most of the Transformers actual disguises, weapons and backstory; to that end I think they missed a big opportunity by basically ignoring the Decepticons until the last 20 minutes of the movie and providing little insight into their personalities and internal conflicts, something the cartoon did so well) and there are some good performances from the cast, despite some of the stupid stuff the script has them do and say, and the fact that many of the supporting players are completely pointless in a movie that already feels overstuffed (what exactly was the point of the Aussy hacker, or Anthony Anderson, well besides comic relief that is).

In a summer of big sequels and remakes and $300 million-plus budgeted blockbusters, it ironic that the fourth ""Die Hard"" - a movie produced for far less dough, was not nearly as hyped as the others, and seemed to have 'bad idea' written all over it - is the only one that really delivers for fans of the series.  ""Transformers"" is not a terrible movie by any means, it just is nothing special and it doesn't do much to reward its faithful followers.  I guess, next to ""Die Hard,"" of all the sequels and remakes this summer, it would rank second, but that's really only by default considering, say,  ""Pirates 3"" made me want to pound my f'ing head into the seat in front of me.  So its competition is pretty non-existent.  And, admittedly, 12 year-old boys (for whom movies like this are mostly intended) will probably think this is the greatest movie they have ever seen... until the next big F/X action blockbuster hits theatres.

Hopefully ""Die Hard's"" dip at the box office will be slim in weeks to come.  Of course it won't out-gross gargantuan dueling robots, but it certainly deserves to.",1183852800,,4628,4.559178743961352

After seeing Transformers and I can honestly say I was not at all disappointed. I was afraid the movie would not live up to my expectations, but it did. I was one of those kids who grew up in the 80's and loved the transformers TV show and all the original action figure transformers, so to me this was truly awesome. This movie is one action packed thrill ride from start to finish. Shia LaBeouf who plays Sam Witwicky does a great acting job in this film and has a great comedic timing. The action sequences are amazing considering the 150 million dollar budget was much less than Spider-Man 3 and the latest Pirates of The Caribbean film. After reading some of the negative reviews it's hard to believe other people saw the same Transformers film I did. Almost everyone in the full packed theatre I was in loved it. Seeing these characters I grew up with come to life, and done in such a great job that does justice rather than dissapoint left me in awwe through most of the movie. Maybe you just have to be a Transformers fan to really appreciate this film, but either was if you like action packed movies TRANSFORMERS does not disappoint!",1183680000,3,1916,4.688427299703264
1614422,1,B00005JPNO,"If I had to write up a list of the worst movies I have ever seen this would be on it right next to Eragon, Battlefield Earth, and A.I. I can't even begin to describe how embarrassingly bad the screen play is for Transformers. It is hard enough to make a serious movie about alien robots that transform into cars without having a screen play that is so illogical that it trashes any hope of a film with any redeeming qualities. Why, why, why would the Decepticons attack a random military base in Qatar to retrieve classified computer files from the U.S. government? And when that fails, instead of going right to the source, they decide to try and get the files from the computers in Air Force One, another random and pointless target just to create attention. Not to mention the fact that no one thought it odd that a cheap boom box was on board the plane under someone's chair.

Can someone please try and explain how the entire sub-plot with the computer hackers and Australian lady had any purpose in the movie at all. She and her hacker friends ended up being of no help and they did nothing to affect the outcome of the movie. Yet, we are stuck watching scenes of them trying to decipher the Decepticon codes and being detained by the FBI and then being taken to the Hoover Dam. Once the Dam scenes are over, you never see them again. A completely pointless plot line that was just left hanging.

I could go on and on with ridiculous and illogical scenes from rooms with computers and ancient radio transmitters being set up to send morse code to the Air Force to plain outrageous scenes with John Turturro as the head of a secret FBI division acting so over the top that I continue to seethe with hatred for him and his character. A secret government agency that no one knows about? Lame. How many times has this plot device been used? Never this poorly, I can guarantee that. All of our modern technology was developed from frozen Megatron? Yeah, right. The government had Megatron for 80 years and they have absolutely no protection or defense ready? Not believable.

I think the scene that finally broke the camels back for me was when one of the Autobots ""lubricated"" on John Turturro's character. What a pathetic and childish attempt to draw some laughs out of an audience.

All of the battle scenes, every - single - one, was done with jerky cameras, blurred vision, blinding lights, collapsing buildings, and hidden views and so I never could figure out who was fighting who. I can understand if this movie is, at its core, a movie about fighting robots. But then why make every single fighting scene so hard to see and follow that you can't tell what is going on? The scene cutting is so frantic and jumbled you would need to watch it in slow motion to figure out who was fighting who, with what, and who was winning. There was not even one single, clear shot of the fighting to make it satisfying in any way.

At the end of the movie we are left with two very poor plot twists that the audience is supposed to accept. First, that both the entire US military and the Autobots would leave it up to a teenage boy to carry the All Spark cube to the top of a building and deliver it to a black hawk helicopter. Second, that after trying to keep the All Spark from Megatron the entire movie, Sam decides to shove it into the Decepticon leader instead of giving it to Optimus Prime. I did not accept these actions at all. How could anyone? They just do not make any sense.

I also do not accept that this film could be considered even passably good by those die hard fans who just wanted to see CGI Transformers in action. The sheer amount of pointless (and extremely illogical) plot lines and inane characters killed this movie and not even giant, alien robots could save it.

1614423,1,B00005JPNO,"Well for die hard fans who know the storyline behind the Transformers, you will maybe not like it.  Original characters are few to none as they only introduce a couple, and besides that half of them don't even ""transform"" into what the original characters conceptual other half originally was.

Megatron is a Jet?  Give me a break, and really the overall design of them is so out of control!  It is like Todd McFarlane or Bart Sears type of artwork only it is done by some guy on the pipe, a billion kajillion little pieces that are all supposed to be something, with of course just the right muscle applied curvatures and such to try and make them look scary.  Yes, scary if you are trying to outdo a hideous monster from hell perhaps.

These were robots that transformed into vehicles, aircraft and weapons, but unfortunately the design team decided to ""do their own thing"".  Jazz was a Porsche, he was always a Porsche, so you make him a friggin PONTIAC SOLSTICE?  And the absence of Wheeljack just to name a few, I cannot believe how many main characters who had so much to do with this story were just left out.  The treatment given to Shockwave is a crime to say the least, absolutely terrible.  I guess they had a cracker jack card and whoever found it got to say who was going where, and what they would transform into..terrible.

It is good they include some backstory but they still make a lot of changes from the original journey from Cybertron as well as the main reason why the Autobots came to Earth in the first place.  Yeah, a bastardization of a cool science fiction story that if the original toys could talk, would be grumbling.  It does not surprise me though, Hollywood is great at you know, destroying innovative ideas and concepts in order to satisfy a junior high kid.  That and the PC parts of this film are so ridiculous, because in real life that does not happen.

The action is great but you know, they chopped up so much of the original backstory of the original Transformers it is not worth it.  Optimus Prime comes off as some cardboard cliche' of some monotone doughhead, when in fact Prime was a very admired leader who had compassion for all the autobots.  I think someone was huffing paint when they wrote this script.  Any of the original creators involved with the Hasbro toyline should be up in arms over this horrendous abomination that really came to late in the first place.",1183680000,8,2415,4.53810623556582
1614424,3,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay has a lot of good movies under his umbrella. However, whether producing or directing, greatness has eluded him. The aversion to greatness held true under his direction of Transformers.

Transformers is a good movie. Tons of action. But Bay gets TV-acting performances (at best) out of the cast.

The movie makes frequent attempts at humor, but most of the intended funny moments border on campy...corny even. Kids will find some of the humor amusing, but serious action fans will tire quickly of the overpopulated campyness.

The Transformers special effects are spectacular. And ya gotta hand it to the producers for heavying up on the FX in the trailers to lure the audience in. But ultimately Transformers is less than meets the eye.

The story is a good one. A robotic civilization brings their civil war to Earth. The Autobots defend mankind from the Decepticons that want to locate and revive their leader who crashed to Earth 100 years ago, then use a talisman of sorts to turn all manmade machinery into robots. Sounds cool and looked cool in the trailers, but I was rooting for the end of the movie as much as I was for the heroes after 90 minutes...and you get 144 minutes of Transformers. A lot of the camp and filler could have been eliminated to make a more seemingly action packed film.

Some of the action was a bit over the top where the stars (human I mean) seemed to be able to defy death. And our main human heroes were a couple of kids from The OC instead of The Military. But, I was entertained. At least you'll now be able to see this cool FX movie on Blu Ray.",1183680000,,1594,4.54006968641115

1614427,4,B00005JPNO,"When I saw that Michael Bay was going to direct this film and have Steven Spielberg be executive producer, I cringed viciously.  Especially with the Spielberg part.  ""No!"" I mentally screamed.  ""Not another 'War Of The Worlds' summer flop!""  However, after viewing ""Transformers"" last night, I can honestly say that this was definately one of the best summer flicks I have seen in a very long time.  The CGI effects alone were worth the price of admission as well as the fairly decent performances on the part of Shia LaBeouf and Jon Voight.  What kept me from ranking this movie as five-star material was the incredibly hokey dialogue that took place during the middle of the film between Shia and his parents.  Also, it was INCREDIBLY unrealistic that parents would actually applaud their teenage son after finding out he had a stone-cold foxy girlfriend in his room.  I think quite the opposite reaction would have taken place.  Also, this is definately not a younger kids' flick.  There are some sexual references that some parents might feel uncomfortable having their young kids listen to and there are some violent images.

However, the story of how the Transformers came to be was really quite fascinating and was actually pretty faithful to the original animated series of the 80's that I grew up on.  All and all, a very enjoyable summer movie.

Also, I just have to say that Megan Fox ain't just a hottie-- she's THERMONUCLEAR!!",1183593600,,1439,4.848360655737705

Yes, I was young enough to almot cry when Optimus died in the cartoon movie, so I was a kid that was indoctrinated into this world. Anyway adult now, and liked this movie, it was fun. It got a little weak towards the end, but still was good and had me waiting to go to the bathroom, so not miss anything. It was worth the money of admission, cool, not ""Gone with Wind"", type movie, a fun, loud movie.",1183507200,,561,4.063063063063063

Add to that a streak of idiotic, and likely inadvertent, racism that paints virtually every black character as emotionally unhinged, vulgar, or both.  There are all kinds of laughs here, but mainly of the cringing, unintentional variety.  I'm tempted to say that it might appeal to 5 year old boys, but why expose them to this kind of cinematic excrement?",1183507200,17,530,4.813186813186813
1614450,5,B00005JPNO,"Michael Bay's reputation for non-stop action flicks that involve multiple explosions has given me pause in the past.  I mean, too many high concept films have been ruined by this sort of lowest common denominator pandering, and when Transformers came out...

Wait a minute, what am I saying?  Non-stop action flick?  Check.  Multiple explosions?  Check!  Big budget special effects?  CHECK. Peter Cullen, the original voice actor of Optimus Prime in the cartoon series, playing Optimus Prime in the movie?  OMG I AM SO THERE!!1!1!

Sorry, sorry, I reverted to my inner twelve-year-old.  Screw high concept films, I wanna see giant robots beating the mechanical crap out of each other! I wanna see the military firing bazookas at said giant robots and then running in terror!  I wanna see giant robots transform in all their mechanical, impossible glory and I wanna see them duke it out in the middle of a crowded street!

Transformers delivers like you wouldn't believe. What I didn't expect is how patriotic the film is.  It's essentially a war movie, filmed with realistic shaky-cam effects from puny human point of view.  It's like that first scene in Spielberg's War of the Worlds, when the tripods pop up out of the city street, only that's the whole movie. It's like the promise that Independence Day was going to be a blockbuster, patriotic movie, only Transformers actually delivers on that promise and doesn't make you feel like an idiot for getting a little misty when our troops fight back against all odds.

Or maybe that was just me.

Anyway, if you love Transformers, it's all here: the Allspark cube (I think it was called the Energon cube or something in the cartoon), Optimus Prime, Jazz, Bumblebee (not a VW Bug, but there's a reason for that), Megatron, Starscream, and a bunch of other Transformers nobody cares about.  Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is here, Scorponok is here...there's so much here that my head threatens to explode from the Transformerery goodness of it all.  It's Transformers, written for fans who remember the series, with a deadly serious take on an invasion of giant transforming robots.

But of course, all this must be rationalized for modern audiences.  So Megatron takes the place of Roswell, and true to conspiracy theories, a shadowy agency (Sector 7, instead of Majestic 12) led by President Hoover keeps Megatron locked up.  And just like in conspiracy theories, all of our futuristic technology is derived from captured Decepticon technology. The Transformers project holograms of pilots and drivers to fool humans, and they've been among us for awhile, watching, waiting, for the right moment to retrieve the doohickey from the government and turn EVERYTHING into a Transformer. It's robotic terrorism at its finest!

Throughout, Transformers finds plenty of humor with the foibles of the humans the Autobots are assigned to protect.  Be it the awkward dance between Sam and the lust of his life (Megan Fox), a hacker (Anthony Anderson) and his smoking hot Australian NSA gal pal (Rachael Taylor), or a military team struggling to survive in the desert (led by Josh Duhamel), Transformers is more than just giant robots and special effects. It's giant robots, special effects, and really hot chicks.  This movie is rated PG-13 and aimed for those who remember when they were thirteen.

Transformers wants you to really, really like it.  Some of the scenes, noticeably the ""thing"" (that's a lot like John Carpenter's The Thing) that I presume was Shockwave, are a little over the top.  But then I remembered that this is a movie about giant transforming flying robots from outer space, and promptly gained some perspective.

From its breathtaking shots of desert combat, reverent scenes of our military in action, to an entire shootout on Air Force One, Transformers is truly a movie made for modern audiences.  And it was a perfect film to watch on Fourth of July.",1183507200,5,3916,4.9984567901234565
1614451,4,B00005JPNO,"I never watched the Transformers cartoons as a kid----that was more my brother's domain.  However, upon seeing the teaser last year, I was eager to see if they could make me enjoy this movie.  Happily, I'll admit that I enjoyed the film.

I'm not sure how true the film makers stayed to the story and characters of the animated show but I enjoyed the wit and humor that they used in the film, not taking the movie too seriously.  The machines themselves were well done and the special effects were the best of any movie thus far in the summer.

As far as the actors, Shia LeBeouf, Hollywood's current ""IT"" boy, does a nice job as a hormonally charged teenager who is drawn into a war that holds the fate of the earth in the balance.  The one other stand out is Jule White, who plays Shia's mother.  She is a firecracker and provides a lot of wicked humor in the film (stay for the first few minutes of the end credits).  The rest of the actors are window dressing...it is the Transformers you want to see and the director gives you a huge dose of them.

The one thing that I felt was a bit shameless in this film was the constant product endorsement.  Ebay, especially, should be extremely grateful for the constant mention (there are several other products but I think ebay's repeated mention was the most obvious).

Otherwise, I think this is the summer ""popcorn"" movie that everyone has been waiting for.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it wind up the biggest movie of the summer (or possibly the year).  At any rate, if you are up for action, some silly laughs and good special effects, ""Transformers"" is the movie for you.",1183507200,2,1627,4.456081081081081
1614452,5,B00005JPNO,"My biggest fear was that this film would just totally destroy the original transformers storyline and be a big joke, but it wasn't. I can see why it took so many years after the original series to bring an actual film (live, non-animated) to the big screen, the special effects are just phenominal in this film and just weren't available back in 1985-88.  Second, despite it having some changes in the origin story of how and why the transformers came to earth, it a good one, and does nothing to tarnish the transformer's legends.  There is no ark, and they didn't crash land here on earth and lay dormint for 4 million years like the Cartoon (and original marvel comics), they came in search of a cube, not just any cube, the cube is the Allspark, lifegiver to all of the transformers (similar to the oricle/spark from the original cartoon and bestwars)  Yes, it is still a civil war of robots, and yes, the cartoon characters are the same ones in the movie.  So they made some changes in the type of cars/vehicles/items that the transformers were, notably bubblebee a camaro not a  Bug, And they used Sam Witwicky instead of spike witwicky (and dad was not notably named sparkplug), no big deal. Overall, they stayed true to the ideals and personalities of the original series, and even the voices and vehicle styles.  Finally, the casting of the actual people was done well, and the acting was actually decent for an action flick.  As a transformer's junkie, I must say I highly recommend seeing this film, and will definitely be on my shelf when available on DVD.  Do note, that unlike the cartoon, this does get fairly violent with people getting stabbed and flying all over the place, so not really great for little kids.",1183507200,2,1728,4.642622950819672

1614454,5,B00005JPNO,"This move is the atypical adaptation.

Hoping for the best, I had also previously prepared myself for experiencing the worst, just in case. I had been to too many other films which, in a rush to make money off of our childhood nostalgia, selectively had forgotten why the original product had been special, and was providing inspiration. Therefore, there were a couple of things which interestingly stuck out. Because I am one of the people who had grown up with and faithfully viewed the original cartoon series, I am going to mention them.

How the transformers and deceptacons got to earth was changed for the movie. Also altered was the transformer's meeting of the Witwickys and their identities. As opposed to being a construction worker alongside dad, Spike is a young high school student who initially is not very popular. He's a nice guy trying to do the right thing, but is not succeeding until meeting up with a very special car via a 'used car lot'.

Then, the 'disguise' appearances of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron apparently was altered in various ways for the benefit of being able to produce this screen play, Optimus has markings, Megatron is a plane, and Bumblebee himself is now an initially mute Camaro; they are different from what had appeared in their classic cartoon series.

Soundwave was altogether missing which is odd considering that tapes still are being produced and he had such a pivotal role as the Deceptacon's 'information agent'. Surely, with everything today about information and secrets (itself a reccuring film theme), he would have been able to play a role for Megatron and his fellow Deceptacons in the screenplay?

Then, I am another one of the people who honestly did not see the point of the 'Australian hacker and her friend' being included in a storyline. They did not help Spike Witwicky and Mikaela Banes, only successful in antagonizing already-power hungry government agents. Unlike Spike and Mikaela, those people also apparently did not understand that the Autobots are our friends.

Still, considering how badly other live-action adaptations of 80's cartoons have bombed (yes, I am especially referring to the original He-Man movie!) this screenplay earned every one of it's received stars. The special effects are really good throughout the screenplay and the movie was over before I actually realized it. Plus, Peter Cullen, the original voice actor for Optimus Prime *among others* had returned for this job and the 'transforming' sound is included in the movie. It could not have been an actual ""Transformers"" reprise without any of those sounds included.

Some of the additions which Bay added into the Transformers worked. Hasbro had originaly introduced it as a 'boys toy' but I also grew up playing with them too. Inadvertently through helping her car-burgular father, Banes gained experience and knowllege of car mechanics, especially useful in the climactic battle when Bumblebee is injured. Impressed with her skills, Sam and the Autobots are not at all fazed or finding the talent 'odd'. Anybody with the skills should use them to help advance justice.

I expect that aspiring production teams and their studios will use this screenplay as a textbook example of how to do a good adaptation from a 'past cartoon'. In the theater I was in, I noticed that people around my age certainly were in attendance. Additionally, today's kids were also riveted to the screen.",1183507200,,3439,5.052910052910053
1614455,5,B00005JPNO,"I'll try to keep this one brief, mostly because I want to run out and see this film again. And, after that, then maybe one more time. Having seen almost all of the high profile blockbusters the summer of 2007 has to offer (with only Harry Potter and Jason Bourne still waiting in the wings), I'm voting for TRANSFORMERS as being the most exhilarating and most entertaining film thus far. Given, I'm biased as I've loved the Transformers ever since when. Two hours and 20 minutes rapidly sped by, and, me, I never noticed. No, it's not Jane Austen's TRANSFORMERS, so check all snobby, high-falutin' ways at the door. It is what it is, shallowly plotted, over the top, and rife with one note characters. But it also boasts giant friggin' robots. And another good performance by Shia LaBeouf. And a smokin' Megan Fox. And giant friggin' robots!

Very early in the film, when enterprising car dealer Bernie Mac informs 11th grader Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) that ""Cars pick their drivers,"" he couldn't have been more spot on - in Sam's case, anyway. Sam ends up with a shabby yellow Camaro that's *ahem* more than meets the eye. Sam's eyes light up when he gets a chance to use his car to hang out with Mikaela (Megan Fox), a classmate he's been crushing on. Now, Mikaela not only is sizzling hot, but she's also automobile savvy, which comes into play much later. In the fullness of time (or, going by movie time, about 15 minutes later), Sam discovers that his Camaro is actually a robot in disguise named Bumblebee, who, by the way, is extremely touchy about his paintjob. Turns out that Bumblebee, who communicates thru a combo of songs and recorded voices from the radio, is Sam's personal protector.

Sam further learns that his arctic exploring grandfather (whose passed on motto is ""No sacrifice, no victory."") had made a significant discovery years and years ago, which a group of evil robots now dearly covet. This group, titled the Decepticons, has been opposed for many a millennia by the Autobots, of which Bumblebee is one. It is revealed that the source of the ages-old conflict is the Allspark, a size-shifting, all-powerful cube which is able to grant sentience to all things mechanical. There, that's the set-up.

One wonders just how much input Executive Producer Steven Spielberg had in TRANSFORMERS. With Michael Bay's preferred expertise firmly affixed to slick cinematography and high octane action sequences, I wouldn't be exactly poleaxed if it turns out that Spielberg was behind the many sweet and funny moments here, moments which provide the very necessary grounding and the film's saving grace. Sam's parents are a bloody riot, ridiculous and goofy as hell, sure, but still lovable. In the wrong hands, they could've been exasperating and the film would've then lost one of its humanizing touches. But, more than anyone, the grounding element is attributed to the male lead, Shia Labeouf. Labeouf plays Sam as underdog enough, and quirky and engaging enough that you can't help but wish good things for the guy. And he's enough of an actor that the scene between him and his damaged Camaro later on brings a lump to the throat.

Another plus is the ingratiating fashion in which the good guy robots are presented. Naturally, they already have 20 plus years of invested good will and childhood nostalgia saved up so that fanboys like me are preordained to like them. But these Autobots are simply awesome. The dazzling CG effects surpassed my expectations. I was so excited to see the seamlessness of it all, the weight and heft seen and felt as these massive mechanical giants interact with and impact their surroundings. There are moments, admittedly, in which they transform at such dizzying speeds that I couldn't quite take it all in, but never mind. It's still eye-popping to see these robots change shapes in mid-air or while whizzing down the highway. It doesn't hurt that they're also somewhat clumsy. It's a hoot watching the lawn-murdering Autobot hide-and-seek sequence outside Sam's window (""Ooops. My bad."").

Oh, there's other stuff I could mention, I suppose. There's the decisive Secretary of Defense (John Voight) who actually doesn't mind getting his hands dirty (Pres. Bush's involvement consists of a demand for Ding Dongs). There's the mysterious, beyond top secret Sector 7, as bullyingly embodied by an off-the-wall and unlikable John Turturro. Meanwhile, actors Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson provide square-jawed heroics as resilient military survivors of the initial Decepticon onslaught. Somewhere here, there's also a hottie of a signal analyst (Rachael Taylor) and a minor bit part (but very funny) for Anthony Anderson. Oh, and Hugo Weaving voices Megatron, who, here, doesn't transform into a gun.

People who are clueless about the 1980s Transformers cartoon series will still walk away content, I think. I came to this film to see colossal robots in a rumble, but I knew that there had to be a story and some sort of nod towards character development. Well, the story's certainly not deep and is fairly easy to follow. However, the nicely realized central characters (Sam, Mikaela, Bumblebee, and Optimus Prime) are what sold it for me. When cut to the nitty gritty, TRANSFORMERS is a story about a boy and his dog. Or, rather, a boy and his robot. The romance angle actually takes a back seat to the relationship between Sam and his beat up Camaro. This is where the first half of the film, which focuses in huge part on Sam and Bumblebee, pays off. So, while I couldn't wait for that big moment in which we first glimpse Optimus Prime, my favorite robot very early on became Bumblebee.

Cripes, so much for the brief review. But, in closing and to echo everyone else, big ups to the film for landing Peter Cullen, who originally was and is again the voice of Optimus Prime. It would've been simply unsatisfying to have had someone else delivering his lines. I actually got a tingle when Optimus rumbled his battlecry: ""Autobots - roll out!""",1183420800,,6002,4.895771878072763
1614456,4,B00005JPNO,"For a nerd that used to drool over this show as a kid, this movie hooks you from the very beginning.  From Optimus Prime's summary intro (with Peter Cullen still at the helm of our favorite alien semi) to the Decipticon attack on the military base, you have no doubts that this is Transformers.  Shia LaBeouf makes his entrance and proves the perfect part for this movie.  He's actually pretty funny and acts the part well.  As far as the rest of the humans in this cast, not as much can be said.

After the awesome introduction, the first part of the movie deals mainly with Shia LaBeouf's Sam purchasing a Camaro that actually turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee (in the cartoon, originally a VW Bug.  I think the yellow VW Bug in the car lot next to Bumblebee was a homage.)  Sam unknowingly uses his alien car to impress a girl.  Of course she actually is impressed when they find out it's an alien.  There are some pretty funny scenes in this part of the movie as well as some action scenes that are very well done.

Soon comes the arrival of the other Autobots and they reveal to Sam their true purpose, which is to locate the Allspark -a powerful device capable of transforming a planet- before the Decepticons get a hold of it.  I thought at this point that the slow parts of the movie were over, but not quite.  From here we go into a few too many scenes dealing with side characters, from video game playing computer experts to goofy secret agents whose quirks border slapstick comedy.  Too many of these characters could be chalked up as comic relief, and most of what they attributed was not very funny.  There was a slightly funny but overly long scene where Sam was trying to hide the autobots while he searched through his house for a relic they needed.  And then arrived John Turtorro (playing the said goofy secret agent) whom I love, but who severely overstayed him welcome in this.  Other performances, namely John Voight's, were just plain campy and the cookie cutter dialogue was cringe inducing at times.

Luckily, I forgot most of that by the time the movie got to its last act.  Once the Decepticons arrive in force the movie is a non stop ride of action and jaw dropping effects.  While someone who's not familiar with the characters and story might not care what the outcome is, I found myself with memories as a kid, watching the 1986 movie for the first time.  I forgot about the humans and their ho-hum sotrylines as my favorite characters and toys from my childhood crashed and shot and ripped each other apart.  I forgot that I was watching CG effects as the transformers look as real as the environment they're destroying.  The action scenes are larger than life and I'm amazed at how well the battles of the cartoons translated onto big screen.  The transformers themselves were all very well done, applying actual physics to their transformations and robot appearances.  They look real and modern but don't lose the heart of what the fanboys loved about them from back in the day.  And Hugo Weaving as Megatron was genius.  I missed hearing the original Starcream, but the original voice actor died many years ago, and the two or three lines Starcream had in this sounded suitable.

Despite the great flaws in acting, dialogue and script, I left this movie with that rare itch to want to go straight back inside and watch it again.  From the previews, it looked like the movie was going to take a realistic perspective and show the warring alien machines from a human point of view.  But that's really not the case at all.  In every other Michael Bay movie, the corny dialogue and overdramatic characters ruin an otherwise good premise.  But Transformers is based on a cartoon, so why shouldn't the movie feel like one?  Here it works.  It's big, dumb nostalgic fun that the kid in me has been after for 20 years.",1183420800,105,3849,4.556040756914119
1614457,4,B00005JPNO,"When I was 9-years old I saw Michael Bay's The Rock. I reacted in such a way that a 9-year old would react in that it floored me. It was an intense trip and it was a movie that I couldn't forget. Actually it was Hans Zimmer's score I couldn't forget, and Zimmer's score for that movie is what inspired me to become a filmmaker. I own every single film Michael Bay has done and after every movie he does I usually read the onslaught of hatred directed at his movies. Critics hate Michael Bay for one reason and that is because he is one dimensional. Is that so bad though? The man can do action and will always do action. From an action movie perspective he does pretty entertaining work. Armageddon is probably his weakest movie in the small handful of flicks that he has done. He tried to be epic in Pearl Harbor but he leaned too much on action. The result was a long wannabe war film. The Bad Boys films are pure adrenaline fun in the tradition of Lethal Weapon with The Island being his first film that had a message. The Rock is just a simply amazing action film with strong characters. With Transformers we get Bay's biggest piece of eye candy yet.

To be honest, when I first heard of this movie I immediately dismissed it. When Bay was named the director I thought what could he do with a movie about toys? I never liked Transformers; I wasn't into that when I was a kid. Luckily Michael Bay made this movie for fans and non-fans. The story revolves around Sam Witwicky; an awkward teenager who gets his first car. Little does he know that his first car is actually an Autobot sent to Earth to retrieve a possession of his. His great grandfather was an explorer who discovered Megatron frozen in the Arctic Circle. Megatron is the leader of the Decepticons who are at war with the Autobots. Both sides are after a talisman called the Allspark which grants unlimited power to the one who possesses it. The Allspark landed on Earth so now the war continues.

The first third of the film basically sets up our characters, and we get Michael Bay's trademark way of starting things off lightly. The first scene is usually an indication of the main conflict of the film and then we jump to our characters that are unaware of the situation. Trust me; all his movies usually start that way. What follows is 2.5 hours of trademark Michael Bay. Things go boom, places get destroyed and people run all the while being shot with 9 different cameras running at high frame rates. There are two kinds of Michael Bay movies, and those are non-CGI heavy action movies and CGI heavy action movies. Transformers is the latter and here we see some of the most impressive visual effects ever seen in an action movie. The amount of detail that was put into the robots is amazing. You truly feel their weight and presence in the environment. Their interaction with the environment around them is what makes them so believable. Something that George Lucas didn't do in his newest Star Wars films which led everything to look cartoonish and awkward. The film brings CGI into the real world and not the other way around, so there is limited use of green-screen. The action is shot in pure Michael Bay style. There will be some scenes in slow motion that have human characters running away with the massive robots battling in the background. Those scenes impressively show off the CG work. Another Bay trademark is the ""low-angle swoosh"" in where the camera is placed low and does usually circles or passes by a character. Then you have the score.

Steve Jablonsky had been a long time collaborator with Hans Zimmer. Every single Michael Bay movie has been scored by one of Zimmer's collaborators or Zimmer himself. Bad Boys was done by Mark Mancina, Bad Boys 2 was Trevor Rabin, Armageddon was Trevor Rabin also, The Rock was by Zimmer and Nick Glennie-Smith with some help from Harry Gregson-Williams, Pearl Harbor was Hans Zimmer, and he found Steve Jablonsky with The Island. Jablonksy had never done a high profile movie by himself, but Hans Zimmer stood as score producer and Jablonsky delivered an amazing electronic/synth based score. Jablonsky was my main reason for wanting to see Transformers and again he delivers a high profile action movie score that would make Hans Zimmer proud. He borrows heavily from Zimmer's Batman Begins, in that the score is not that complex. It does its job and makes the action so much more intense and awe inspiring.

We get a great performance from Shia LaBeouf who carries the film easily. After this and Indiana Jones 4 coming up it will only be a matter of time until we start seeing him in serious dramatic roles. There is a bright future for this rising star. The voice acting for the Transformers was done to be as close to the original movie as possible. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime. When casting for Megatron Michael Bay decided the original voice actor's voice aged too much so he was replaced by Hugo Weaving from The Matrix Trilogy. We get supporting performances from Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson.

Transformers is great summer fare. Michael Bay will never win an Academy Award but he is the best at what he does, which is directing action. The only problem with the film is that at times it falls into melodrama, and melodrama with robots can make your eyes roll. It also becomes a big commercial for GM since it profiles about every brand of car they produce. Other than that the film will entertain immensely and you will not feel like you wasted money on another summer dud.",1183420800,25,5581,4.605025125628141
1614458,4,B00005JPNO,"Giant robots come to earth, but there's 2 sides with one good and one bad. One side the Decepticons can careless about mankind and other the Autobots are  out to protect mankind. While the government trys to figure out who's attacking them and if it's an enemy country. Michael Bay obviously loves America and loves his mushy romances. The Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox scenes work better than any of the overly mushy stuff from Pearl Harbor or Armageddon though. Since their scenes together are sweet and Megan Fox is a good looking girl that the camera loves. So I don't mind the camera on her a lot at all lol.

  But if you are a huge fan of the cartoon series you may want more Transformers and less humans though. Although there's still pleanty of stuff with them. Even if some of the Autobots can come off as annoying as the talking toys in Small Soldiers. The one we care more about here more than Optimus Prime even is Shia LaBeouf's first car Bumblebee which actually steals the show. The action and effects are fantastic but there's too many scenes with soldiers in the way shooting at the Decepticons eventhough....their weapons barely do anything to them!

  Plus when the Transformers collide the action isn't as good as it could be. They basically can just clunk together. Their fights in the cartoon show were of course better. Plus the movie does the Autobots more justice than it does the Decepticons. We mostly just get to know the Autobots and the super cool Megatron doesn't even appear until like the last 20 minutes. Still though the movie does do a lot of the stuff from the show justice and it should satisfy die hard fans. I wouldn't mind a sequel with less humans and more Autobots and Decepticons and maybe even some space battles. But then again I can always handle more of Megan Fox lol.",1183420800,,1814,4.563076923076923
1614498,4,B00005JPNO,"I would have loved to see this film in the directorial hands of Steven Spielberg or James Cameron, but Michael Bay didn't screw everything up this time. The CGI, as mentioned in every review you read, is flat out amazing. There was also a lot more humor than I expected, and most of it worked. Shia LaBeouf is turning into a fine young actor, though his performance in Disturbia is fleshed out much more. Megan Fox is a babe, pure and simple. Her performance was okay, but her looks alone should get her far in hollywood. There were a few horrible lines and the military guys weren't very believable at all, but other than that I had a blast.

The theater I was in busted out in applause at least five times during the movie, so that tells you how most people felt about the film.

1614499,5,B00005JPNO,"Normally, I'm a purist when transferring stories from books or comics to the big screen. Occasionally however, a movie so good comes along (ie: Batman, Spiderman, Superman Returns... etc) that it makes me forget what came before. This is such a movie.

This was the first movie I have been to in years where, at the end, the audience stood up, applauded and cheered. This film blows away all the competition so far this century. Simply outstanding.

If you think this is campy then you have never seen the original Batman TV show. Or the Green Hornet for that matter. Yes, it has many light-hearted moments. However,  this film did not pull punches when it came to people being killed. It was vicious without being bloody. Most of the heartlessness of the Decepticons against humanity was fully portrayed without the use of blood and guts but with implication. It was not campy.

The CGI in this film was the most outstanding I have ever seen. It was seamless and fluid, making it all seem very real. The cinematography was similarly outstanding, making good use of the animation. I can't believe I'm gonna say this but the direction was also fantastic. There, I said it. Michael Bay... sheesh.

 I saw it with my teenage children and it had us all on the edge of our seats much of the time.

As the old cliche says, if you are a fan of action or sci-fi movies and see only one film this year, make sure this is the one.

After reading many more reviews and comments here and there across the Internet, I HAVE to make this comment:

Yes, SOUNDWAVE IS in the movie!! The problem is that he's in such a vastly different form than we've come to expect that most people haven't recognized him (The audience I watched the movie with, however, had no such problem.)

If you believe that Soundwave is not in the movie than you have either not watched it or did not pay attention.",1183420800,,1910,4.5659824046920825
1614500,4,B00005JPNO,"Pretty much almost every male kid who grew up during the 80's were glued to their TV sets on weekday afternoons watching just one thing. They were watching one of the best cartoon shows on TV which also happened to be Hasbro Toys' most popular line of toys at that time. I am talking about Transformers. I know I was pretty much hooked on the show with its tale of good versus evil as the noble leader (who also happened to be a Mack truck) Optimus Prime led his Autobots against the evil robot that was Megatron and his Decepticons. It had lots of fighting, explosions and most of all, it had toys of every Transformer in the show for kids to re-enact such battles.

In 1986 the first Transformers movie (animated) came out and pretty much scarred every kid who was ever a fan of the show for life as their beloved characters actually died on-screen to make way for a new generation of Transformers. Let's just say that as much as I enjoyed the original movie I also hated it. It is now 2007 and Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg and ILM have concocted a live-action version of Transformers. To say that this movie has erased some of the bad taste left by the first animated film is quite an understatement. What we have in this live-action Transformers is nothing less than pure robot-versus-robot carnage and mayhem done so well that it more than makes up for the weak story and the uneven performances from the cast.

The movie revolves around the search by both the Autobots and the Decepticons for the all-powerful AllSpark which would grant it's owner the power to rebuild the dying Cybertron (home world of the Transformers) or remake any planet into a new home. It's not too difficult to figure out what the Decepticons and their leader Megatron would do once they have it in their possession. As one of the Decepticons would have stencilled on its vehicle mode says: ""To punish and enslave"". The AllSpark is really just a MacGuffin which helps tie in the Transformers with the human aspect of the story and that's the time tested tale of a boy and his car. In this case, it's Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his newly acquired 1974 Camaro who also happens to be the Autobot Bumblebee unbeknownst to him.

The first third of the film is where this boy and his car theme gets the most laugh as Sam tries to use his new car to get the attention of one  Mikaela (played by the ridiculously hot and appropriately named Megan Fox). The laughs come from Bumblebee playing just the right song over the radio to try and bring the two kids together. Usually Michael Bay's handle on comedy is a tad more cynical and ham-handed which tell me the first third of this film had Steven Spielberg's influence all over it. One could just substitute E.T. for Bumblebee and Elliott for Sam and it's not difficult to see.

This first third also solidifies Shia LaBeouf as the foundation which keeps the movie from just becoming one long robot-on-robot action scene. This kid has some major talent and charisma which shows from the moment he steps on to the screen right up to the final scene with the sun setting in the background. It's no wonder Spielberg chose him to be in the next Indiana Jones movie. LaBeouf actually makes Sam Witwicky more than the awkward, geeky teen geek and instead makes it believable that he has a weird, charming chance to land the hot Mikaela. It's LaBeouf's performance as Saw which pretty much saves the very uneven performance by the rest of the cast.

Even with LaBeouf's performance and the funny and cute boy meets car meets girl first reel, people really went to see this movie for one thing and one thing only and that's the battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons. The humans are there to ground the story in a semblance of reality. But once the two sides begin to arrive and find their Earth forms the movie shifts into nitrous-injected overdrive and doesn't let up until the very end. People cheered wildly once Optimus Prime appears for the first time with the rest of his crew (Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet). The cheering went especially wild once optimus spoke for the first time and the original voice was heard (Peter Cullen did the voice for the original cartoon and was hired to do the same for the moive). That scene really brought myself and, most likely, every male in the audience of the same age back 20 years. The Decepticons make their entrance soon after with Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) being the final Transformer to hit the screen. The rest of the movie became one long action sequence after sequence with destruction being the norm.

This is where Michael Bay's hand truly shows as his handle on the sturm und drang he's well-known for matches well with the premise of giant alien robots fighting each other with no thought for collateral damage to populace and property. Unlike, his previous films he actually holds himself back from using his usual tricks of using low-angled slo-mo scenes too much and the ultra quick editing style which makes his movies sometimes difficult to keep up with. Again, it might be Spielberg's influence in addition to Bay actually growing as a filmmaker to thank for this. The action scenes wouldn't be as great as it was if it wasn't for the work of ILM and its team of computer animators. The Autobots and Decepticons look so real that they join Gollum and Davey Jones as fully-realized CGI-characters who blend into the scene as if they're made of real flesh and blood. In the case of the Transformers made of steel, oil and rubber. Their battles from the Hoover Dam all the way to the nearby Mission City didn't look artificial. There's a sense of weight and depth to the battle. It atually looked like the city with it's small humans was actually being ripped apart by these giant robots. Industrial, Light and Magic truly deserve every award they'll get come awards time. In the past it was said that a live-action Transformers would come off as cheesy and fake, but technology and the expert use of it by ILM's team of artisans has made it a reality.

Transformers really brings the word blockbuster and brings it like storm and thunder. There's no other way to say it than this was a movie which was a kickass rollercoaster ride with just enough human interaction to keep it from becoming cartoonish. It's not a perfect film as the weak script and uneven performances by most of the cast would show, but it's all balanced out by the work put in by Shia LaBeouf and the action scenes with the Transformers that this movie marks the highlight of the 2007 summer blockbuster season. Michael Bay has finally found the one film he looks to be tailor-made to do.",1183420800,233,6652,4.612331081081081
1614501,2,B00005JPNO,"Going into Michael Bay's ""Transformers,"" I was expecting an action oriented thrill ride. What I got was an action oriented thrill ride that was purposely trying to be campy. For all its high tech special effects and entertaining battle sequences, this movie is overstuffed, badly scripted, and overwhelmingly jokey, as if to say that a film about outer space robots not only can't, but also won't be taken seriously. Indeed, such an idea can only exist within a closed universe, one that intentionally gears itself towards adolescent males. This is probably why the original Hasboro action figures and subsequent cartoon series were so popular. On the same token, this is probably why the film adaptation doesn't work; ""Transformers"" is a Saturday morning kids' show with good special effects, and nothing more.

As the film opens, a voiceover narration tells us about a special cube and its connection to a planet of warring machines: the Autobots (the good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). The cube supposedly has the ability to turn any inanimate machine into a fully functioning robot, and for this reason, the Decepticons wanted it. It was then hidden on Earth for thousands of years. Now, both robot factions are invading Earth in the hopes of finding it. This aspect of the story is easy to swallow because, at the very least, it's an interesting setup. Not so easy to swallow is the way the rest of the film carries itself, especially when it comes to the characters. The filmmakers seemed to think that every cast member should play his or her role as comedy relief, even during specific scenes that are anything but funny.

The main character is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenager who gets involved with the robots because of family ties--and because of an inherited pair of glasses. His great grandfather was an explorer, and while on an expedition in the Arctic Circle, a frozen Decepticon imprinted something special on his glasses, something that would help the robots in their search for the cube. As you might expect, both Autobots and Decepticons are now looking for Sam. Contact is finally made when a transformed Autobot is sold as Sam's first car. He, of course, has no idea what his car really is, which is bad because he's desperately trying to impress Mikaela (Megan Fox), the high school hottie.

Eventually, a number of other Autobots arrive on Earth. They reveal themselves to Sam in scene so ridiculous that it wasn't even laughable. Each computer-generated robot has a distinct personality: one talks like a ghetto gangster; one is a trigger-happy hothead that quotes from ""Dirty Harry."" The leader--Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen)--explains that they used the World Wide Web to learn how to speak like we do. I'm sorry, but I didn't believe this for a second. Even for a fantastic science fiction story, this kind of character development ruins the fine line between a sense of humor and full-blown silliness. It only gets worse when the robots convene in Sam's back yard (how no one could have noticed sixty-foot-tall behemoths in a suburban area, I don't presume to wonder); let's just say that his parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) are clueless.

A subplot featuring the American government is woven all throughout, as would be expected. Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) has commissioned a special task force to find out who--or what--has been hacking into the country's most secure computer files. Some think it may be intelligence from enemy countries, such as North Korea or Iran. But specialist Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) thinks otherwise; it must be some kind of computer-based organism. To prove this, she enlists the help of computer hacker Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson). Why any of these characters were included is beyond me. Not only did they make an already chaotic story even more chaotic, they also clash with every other aspect of the film.

The climactic robot battle on the streets of Los Angeles begins when the evil Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is finally released after decades of imprisonment in the top secret Sector 7 (I won't reveal its location, not because I'd be giving anything away, but because it's completely implausible and thus not worth mentioning). The Autobots and Decepticons engage in combat so fierce that the entertainment factor is quickly lost. The final scenes run like a hyperactive Japanese monster movie, so aggressive and over the top that they're liable to induce headaches. At a certain point, I no longer cared about the characters, nor did I care whether or not the cube would actually be found. How disappointing: scenes like this should have been entertaining.

Truth be told, the entire film should have been entertaining. ""Transformers"" is founded on an escapist idea that had the potential to be a lot of fun. Then again, it's quite possible that it was never meant to be a live action film; such a story could only appeal to a very select audience, namely the youngsters who own the Hasboro action figures. This movie may appeal to them, but what about the rest of us? I felt like an outsider watching this movie, and ultimately, it seemed as if the film was having too good a time at my expense. I don't pretend to be the most knowledgeable when it comes to ""Transformers,"" but I have a hard time believing this film adaptation does justice to the original idea.",1183334400,7,5397,4.918770581778266

1614503,5,B00005JPNO,"Adrenaline-soaked fight sequences and massively destructive gunplay pushes Michael Bay's Transformers into a new sector of action films. Fusing eye-popping computer animated robot transformations with an abundance of comical characters and outright humor, Transformers also boasts a particularly appropriate cast and a coherent storyline (unusual for this type of science-fiction). Despite the dispensable automaton jargon and the markedly preachy Optimus Prime, it is an undeniable fact that Transformers will create huge box office success and inevitable sequels.

A mysterious attack on a US base in Qatar leaves an entire squadron massacred with only a handful of survivors quickly making their way to a neighboring village. As the government attempts to track what they think are terrorists who staged the assault, hundreds of miles away, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) picks out his first car. A seemingly normal 11th grade student, Sam is unknowingly caught up in an intergalactic war about to start on Earth between two alien life forms that have the ability to simulate any mechanical device. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots (the human-friendly group of alien Transformers) enlightens Sam about a secretive Allspark cube which has been hunted for by Prime and his mortal enemy Megatron for a very long time. Having landed somewhere on Earth, Sam may be the only one who can help the Transformers locate it before Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons (non-human-sympathizers), uses it to destroy the world.

From the first few moments of the film when Blackout (the helicopter) transforms and the audience nearly jumped out of their seats with applause, it's not difficult to formulate what kind of impact this film will have on the casual fans as well as the truly devoted. Regardless of how faithful the story is to the original cartoons and action figure line, the explosive power of this film is unmatched. The action sequences rival almost anything made to date, and ironically parallels the other July 4th box-office-record-setting hopeful of 2007, Live Free or Die Hard. While Die Hard attempts to mimic realism with its overly creative stunts and chases, it goes so overboard that both physics and general believability are immediately questioned. Yet in Transformers, where we're already dealing with giant science-fiction robots, the fights and battles across the city feel more realistic, at least in that we believe the catastrophe caused by the hulking automatons.

Unrelenting and exceptionally exhilarating, from the opening sequence attack to the ""Kill Bill"" themed Camaro transformation to the unbelievably destructive epic battle finale, nothing was spared in the pursuit of creating the most intense action ever filmed. At some points the action doesn't let up and we almost believe Michael Bay has gone too far. Too much of anything lessens the impact, and this holds true for the nonstop affrays. Running slightly too long, it seems if anything had to be edited out, it would be some of that action. But as is, the film is packed so tightly with maelstroms of blazing bullets and grinding metal-on-metal robotic pummeling, that you're not likely to see anything more exciting this summer.

Shia LeBeouf is astonishingly remarkable as Sam Witwicky, who is sarcastic, cynical and the epitome of a typical teenager. His character provides excellent comedy to counteract with the surviving Army squadrons' never-faltering stoicism. He is likable and down-to-earth in a way that compliments the Transformers and their varying imitated attitudes. John Voight manages to be a droning stereotypical government man, and John Turturro gathers laughs as the unreasonably determined, cocky chief of Sector Seven, the Area 51-like government agency that deals with Transformers. Optimus Prime's voice acting is also worth mentioning as the studio was able to get Peter Cullen who originally voiced the character on the cartoon series. His character becomes eye-rolling preachy at times, but because he's a deep-voiced gigantic robot, he retains a nobly powerful presence nonetheless.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the Transformers is just how much comedy has been fused with the revolutionary CG. Shia is constantly the source of laughs, the Autobots make an attempt at humor and a large percentage of the supporting cast is entirely comic relief, including Anthony Anderson, Bernie Mac, Kevin Dunn and Julie White (Sam's parents) and even Decepticon Frenzy. Subtler humor includes references to Spielberg's other films and a particularly comical decal on Barricade (the cop car) that boasts: ""To Punish and Enslave"".

The computer animation and special effects are beyond anything we've seen before. The transformations themselves are absolutely astounding, with countless swiveling parts and mechanical flurries. Perhaps the complexity is present to conceal the fact that not all the pieces actually line up with the vehicles they mimic (especially considering the gargantuan size of the robot compared to the corresponding vehicle). But the movement and fighting between robots is so shockingly awe-inspiring that we forgive their awkward mechanical lips and other shortcomings. Despite the few hindering aspects of this special effects masterwork, Michael Bay's Transformers is likely to be the largest blockbuster of the summer. Following in the footsteps of the popular slogan, this film truly has more than meets the eye.

1614504,5,B00005JPNO,"Not often we get a major film release before the Yanks, so when we do ya just gotta make the most of it!

First - Thank the Gods they went with the original Transformers.... yup - Optimus Prime and Megatron are back! Some uber nerds will no doubt complain that its not exactly the same as the series, but as that was over 20 years ago I think the degree of modernisation is definately warranted. Most notably Bumblebee is a Chevy Camaro instead of a VW (apparently to avoid comparisons with Herbie). I was disappointed Soundwave was omitted, but IMDB says they couldn't quite get him right and have him lined up for the sequel (already??). Still - the Autobots are very good, the Decepticons are very evil, and the humans are pretty much useless.  Is there anything else?

The other major change is Megatron, who now becomes a jet instead of the Walther P38 he transformed to in the series. I always wondered why the leader of the decepticons became a tool for someone else to use, so am quite in favour of this alteration. Story goes it had to do with the merchandising also - parents not wanting to buy kids toy guns etc... gotta think of the merchandising of course eh?

Apparently it took 38 hours to render one frame of CGI animation - and it is absolutely awesome. It's not of course remotely believable that that thumping huge robot could morph into that little bitty car, but when you get caught up in it all you really don't care, and the way they do it you start thinking that maybe, just maybe it actually might! It does however get hard to tell good guys from bad during the faster moments, but thats the only real criticism I could come up with.

The action scenes are excellent, although perhaps too much happens too quickly leaving the viewer trying to catch up at times. Although this adds to the rollercoaster effect of the film it gets a bit annoying when you start thinking ""I'll watch out for that bit when I get the DVD"" and the film isn't even finished yet.

I guess the director realised that most original fans would be into their thirties by now, and has in no way made a childrens film. It received an M rating here and does have quite a bit of violence and death. Almost two and a half hours long yet seeming a lot shorter - this is definately one for the big screen.",1183248000,5,2294,4.385882352941176

It kicks off in Afghanistan where the US troops have a base and find themselves under attack, then moves on to the main actor who's dad takes him out to buy his first car.. no spoiler, ya saw all that in the trailers. His first car you can guess what it is, and eventually the autobots reveal themselves and explain what they are doing on Earth and why ... ya know, the plot to the movie.

And it's up to the autobots to help Earth defeat the deceptocons.

I went to see this movie with high hopes and i guess I just personally hyped it up too much in myself and thats why I feel kind of let down by the movie. I dunno, the first 30 minutes just seemed to me like it was not needed, and like it was there to kill time. And i was not impressed by how the Autobots kind of just all show up at once and are introduced by Prime like a... cartoon... errr... anyways

The movie has plenty of actions, but the thing that bugged me was how out of focus a lot of the stuff was... like the military scenes are a shaking around camera so you don't really get a good look at anything... they may have done that on purpose so you don't get to see a good shot of a transformer till the autobots show up later in the movie, but I think they should have let you see it from the start imo.

The ending of the film I was not thrilled with. It was OK, but could have been a better ending instead of how this thing does end.

I heard mixed reaction as I walked out of the cinema, some where saying it's the best thing they had ever seen in there entire life, other where saying it was not as good as they had hoped (like me) but I didn't hear anyone say it was terrible (or words like it)

Overall: It's watchable, it's full of action, and will pass 2 hours of your life without leaving you thinking you have wasted it. But, if you don't get to see it in the theater and have to wait for DVD, well, you won't have missed something unforgettable.

UPDATE: DVD Review - 4 stars.

When I went to see this film in the theaters, I left feeling kind of disappointed and only thought it was a 3 star movie.

However, the second time around watching this, I knew what was about to come up next, so I wasn't in those thoughts of ""wheres the Transformers"" - ""what are these guys going to look like"" and also the comparing of the Transformers to the original cartoon that so many of us grew up loving.

I was able to just pop the DVD and watch it at my own pace without all the anxiety and anticipation that it had the first time, and I picked up on what I missed when being too focused on comparing it to the original when I first saw it.

The movie now I think is top notch action and stunning visual effects that even I think look fantastic. Usually when I see a CGI movie I get turned off by how bad something looks, about how it doesn't look real and then I get sick to the stomach thinking about how the DVD will be filled with ILM patting themselves on the back about how fantastic it looks and what a great job they did with new ground breaking effects never seen before.

However, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg have done a fantastic job on brining the Transformers to the live action screen. I have heard so many original fans all going about how they did not look like they did in the cartoon and the cars where not right and all that dibble. Well, this is 20 odd years later, and I think they have done an incredible job creating something new, but with a familiar feel to it.

On the 2nd time around watching this, I'd excepted the fact that they did not look like the cartoon versions, Bumblebee was not a Volkswagens Beetle and Megatron was not a gun. And later when I was watching some of the bonus features, they explain why... and it made a lot of sense, that this is the big screen, and they could do these guys in much bigger detail then imaginable by cartoon law, but at the same time making it more of a believable environment... to explain that better, Megatron was a 20 foot robot in the original cartoon and transformed into a small hand gun... on the big screen, why would an 80 foot giant robot man shrink into a pistol?

Bunble-bee I guess some could still complain about him not being a Volkswagen, but it Michael Bay did not want him to be one, plus the had a sponsorship with GM. However, I really did agree on the changes with the rest of the characters, they where from the 80's, characters like Star Scream where an F-15 at the time, the fasted plane around in the 80's, but that was 20 years ago, and now Star Scream is the new fastest plane around... whatever it is? And the same went for most of the other characters being upgraded to later models or similar models. The one I really appreciated was Ratchet. Ratchet was an ambulance in the cartoon, but based off a Japanese style ambulance, now he has been upgraded to a fictional custom made Hummer Emergency vehicle that does look very nice in the film.

Getting back to the movie itself, I really liked how it explains that the Transformers are not cars and trucks and what not from another planet, but actually a DNA Computer type of alien, and when they come to Earth, they scan a vehicle and can become it. That really made a lot of sense, cause when you think about the Cartoon, these robots all came from another planet, yet they looked just like cars and planes and trains of Earth. The Cartoon was never based on realism, it was just made for kids who thought it was cool to see vehicles transform and then wanna buy the toys. However, coming to the big screen, and with the world wide fan base it has now from the young to the old, it would seem kinda weird for these aliens to come to Earth and look just like cars made on this planet. So, i thought that was a really good idea to design them that way, and the visuals they given the transformers of this movie are amazing once you get past the fact they aren't going to look like the 80's versions.

Some of the plot to this movie is really well thought out too... they did not make this movie as a quick cash in knowing people would flock to it, with ideas of why the Hoover Damn was built, and how to shut down these robots, where to put them when there dead, there pretty cool and believable little details that make it fantasy, but if this did happen, it's most likely how it would really be done. About the only thing I did not think was thought through was, if your about to go to war with 100 foot machine men, why go to a populated city? I'm not sure the sectary of defense would be all for that, but, it's just the way the movie is to have a cool city battle and see the bleep hit the fan and cars and buildings blow up.

Overall, I was afraid Michael Bay was going to screw this thing up, as where 1000's of fans, and tho the 1st time I walked away thinking it was a bit disappointing, the 2nd time around I got what was going on, and it made a lot more sense and I really enjoyed it a heck of a lot more.

Usually I despise and write negative reviews about movies that end where it sounds like a sequel is going to be made when they don't know if this one is going to be a success, but for once in my life, I cant wait for the sequel to Transformers.

Even the bonus features are worth checking out on this, there isn't all that junk ILM usually throw in patting themselves on the back and boring you with every last detail of how the robots where designed, it actually shows some cool stuff on how they did this film in live action, and not CGI. There was a hell of a lot more going on, well, there is allot more then meets the eye to the stunts and action of this film.",1183075200,2,8391,4.150153846153846
1614506,5,B00005JPNO,"I've seen the movie last night, you know in Italy it got out on June 28, and I must say it's awesome! Great CG, good music and a good story. Characters are well drawn, humans and cybertronians, and I love the new design.
I can't tell about the voicing of the Transformers because it's in Italian, but they did a great job. One thing is thta for Optimus they used the same actor that dubbed Patrick Stewart on Star Trek TNG and when he talks about a cube you kind of wait for the Borg to appear... ;D

Just go and see it over and over again, and wait for the end credits there are three goodies in the middle.",1183075200,,608,4.066666666666666
