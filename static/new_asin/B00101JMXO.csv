8236515,1,B00101JMXO,"This was the worst waste of $10 ever! The videos are nothing that you can't see for free on YouTube. The entire video is only 27 minutes long. The only section that has any talking is at the end when 5-6 guys from the HRT explain their specific teams equipment and even that is of no real value because it is so completely out dated that he mentions satellite communication as something that the HRT is going to be doing in the future. Do not buy this video, instead just search for FBI HRT on youtube or google.",1293580800,,512,4.23469387755102
