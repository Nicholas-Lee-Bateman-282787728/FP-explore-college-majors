8522915,5,B007XIO9KO,"A charming and well-made documentary of Alice Donut, it tracks the band from its origins through to the ""where are they today?"" business at the time of the film's production. It doesn't spare some of the touchier issues of Donut's past (such as the changes in the band's line-up), and serves as a fantastic journey down memory lane with a still semi-active underground classic.

Simply put, if you've ever seen Donut play, you almost certainly adore them. So, if you've seen Donut play, this is a must-have rock music documentary.",1386201600,,530,4.888888888888889
8522916,5,B007XIO9KO,"Alice Donut was my favorite band through my high school years. I felt so punk-rock to have a t-shirt of a band that no one else had heard of! I saw them play one time, an all ages show at the 7th St Entry.

This rock-u-mentary was great because I always wanted to know more about the band. I learned things like, who is that guy in drag on the album covers...

I am a lifetime freak in love!",1374019200,,391,3.9367088607594938
8522917,5,B007XIO9KO,"This is an excellent documentary on one of my favorite bands. I was impressed by the editing and production work. Loaded with interviews, concert footage and animations. It answered a lot of questions I've had over the years about the various band members and associated weirdos. Feel lucky to have met several people featured in this film at different times in my punk fantasy life. Watching them mature and adapt to a tiny, ugly world that spins much too fast gives me encouragement for my own golden years.",1348272000,5,509,4.795454545454546
