8267976,5,B001808CU6,Now this is an excellent action/sci-fi anime! I'm happy I finally decided to buy it!,1404691200,,84,4.666666666666667
8267977,4,B001808CU6,Great story line enjoyed chareters. Not too short. I like for my animies to be at least 300 minutes or more. It has just enough action to keep you interested.,1351123200,,158,4.3
8267978,5,B001808CU6,"I haven't purchased this boxset (yet), but I have already seen it. I was searching for something after I was done watching Cowboy Bebop and I found it - Coyote Ragtime Show. The storyline is pretty good and the characters are well developed. My only quarrel with this anime series is just that, that it is a series, a very short series at that. Other than this, this DVD is a must watch/buy!",1220313600,,391,4.36986301369863
