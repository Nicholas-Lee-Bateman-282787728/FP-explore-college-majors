8094574,5,B000BZ1LI4,Great dvd on kundalini yoga.  A good balance of exercises and cool down periods.  A good buy,1417478400,,92,4.352941176470588
8094575,5,B000BZ1LI4,"This Yogi Bhajan sequence, so clearly demonstrated by Donna Davidge, not only leaves one energized and flexible but in tune on a synergistic level with the rest of the world.  There is something magical about this set and this particular type of kundalini kriya.  One can also feel Donna Davidge's purity of purpose, truly wanting to inspire the viewer to practice yoga.  Along with kundalini, I also do power yoga, and on rare occasions, lift weights.  This is the perfect DVD to do the day after any high impact exercise regimen.  Amazingly, I really believe this kriya gives me good luck.  I don't know if this is the result of the combination of breathing and movement, the Wahe Guru chant at the end or a combination of all these components.  Whatever the reason, the alchemy of this set works on all levels of the body/mind complex.",1144800000,7,838,4.698630136986301
8094576,5,B000BZ1LI4,"This DVD is a clear, simple and elegant demonstration of how to practice this type of yoga.  The techniques and postures are easily learned by the beginner, and can lead to  strength, and greater flexibility. Along with this, the 'feel good' experience  kicks in; the body/mind experience. I love it, I can put this DVD on and it'll help me work through all the sequences like in a class.  This practice is 'maintenance plus' and  this teacher gives us a great 'leg up' to the material that makes us divinely fit.

8094577,5,B000BZ1LI4,"Flexibility and the spine is a fun kriya that is very hard.  Donna has taken the exercises and made them accessible to everyone.  The poses are (if memory serves me) archer, stretch pose, spinal flexes, locust, bow, and the best part is going from plow to seated forward bend.  This sequence is normally done 50x, but Donna has reduced the number of reps.  There is also a 1.5 minute Sat Kriya.  If I have one complaint about the DVD is that the Sat Kriya is NOT long enough.  It was 5 minutes in the original set.  I put the DVD on pause and do it for 3 or 5 minutes.  There are also deep crow squats.  These are a killer! Watch your knees on this one.  The DVD ends with a too short breathing meditation.  The setting for the DVD is on a rock near a lake.  My first impression was OH NO she looks so uncomfortable.  But it is beautiful scenery that you only see once since you do Kundalini yoga with your eyes closed.  All in all I liked this DVD and as I get stronger, I plan on increasing the pose times to their original times. Normally this set would take 90 minutes to do.  Donna has condensed it to 40 minutes (excluding tune-in, warm ups and meditation)  Very accessible for the beginner!",1132876800,13,1197,4.230088495575221
