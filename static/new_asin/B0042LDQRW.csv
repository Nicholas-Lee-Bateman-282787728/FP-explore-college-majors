8413836,3,B0042LDQRW,"I'm very upset. I thought this DVD was $9.99, but after they charged my debit card the full $9,999,999 I didn't notice that the order cleaned out my bank account leaving me with a negative balance and because of this my checks have been bouncing for the past two years.

An added irritation is that they neglected to credit me the $3.99 super saver shipping.

However, the DVD was an interesting documentary--who hasn't wished to see the reactions of primitive tribespeople to a large photo portrait of themselves, especially when they believe that being photographed takes away their eternal soul? Who isn't at least a little curious about how they will react? And now, to finally have that gnawing question answered from the safety of one's living room makes the price perfectly understandable.

If you're concerned about the cost, please be assured, the documentary gets better on each watching. In fact, I will be getting copies for all my friends--soon before the price goes up. The low popularity (amazon sales ranking) for this item is a sorry testament to our society's shallow preoccupation with paying rent, grocery bills, etc. Consider that with each copy of the DVD you buy, you are doing your part to redefine this society's warped priorities.",1307750400,2,1256,4.9714285714285715
8413837,2,B0042LDQRW,"I was getting ready to purchase this item when I saw this line in the description:

""A portion of sales will be donated directly to Survival international, helping tribal people of the Omo Valley defend their rights, protect their lands and determine their own futures.""

Whoa, I thought. I may have been ready to spend $10 million on a DVD, but not if I don't know where that money is going. Just how much of my $10 million is going to actually help the tribal people and how much is going to ""adminstrative expenses,"" huh? Something sounds fishy there, and I don't like it. So, on the principle of not foolishly giving away money, I refuse to spend $10 million on this DVD for the present moment. Maybe the creator of the DVD could give us more details about how the money is spent if he wants people to just fork over that kind of dough.

For all I know, only a few million could be going to the tribal people, and in an ironic twist, maybe it will just fund a legal battle against the creator of the DVD for using their images without proper legal permissions. The rest of the proceeds, of course, going to the DVD maker's legal battle defending his work against the tribes' lawyers. No, I don't believe I'm ready to get caught up in such a pointless affair. I'll save my millions for the various Blu-ray versions of the Star Wars saga that George Lucas will no doubt push out for the next few decades.",1305849600,4,1406,4.379310344827586

8413839,5,B0042LDQRW,"I got it when it was $20 and I'm making a killing. It has gone up recently because word has gotten out that Ben Bernanke will be buying videos in QE3, and this one is first on his list. The Fed will start at $20 million...

Goldman Sacs ""just happens"" to have bought a few thousand so far.",1300838400,10,289,3.9827586206896552
8413840,1,B0042LDQRW,OBVIOUSLY this video is not worth 10 million dollars or it be in Guinnues world Records for being the most ridiculous rip off ever!!!!!!! You can get it on the photographers website for Twety dollars($20)Yes thats right 20 f'ing dollars,1300147200,5,236,4.925
8413841,4,B0042LDQRW,"Clearly this item is worth 9.5 million, but not 9.9 million.  I was thinking they could at least throw in a free dust cover to make it worth the price they ask.  Sorry this review isn't longer but I have a bid on a $200,000 gumball that was said to have come from a machine at store that was once a spot near somewhere that someone famous once thought about.

Cheers.",1297987200,32,367,4.140845070422535
8413842,1,B0042LDQRW,"Interesting product!  I must confess that I have not seen the video, therefore I cannot offer an opinion about it, but I was hoping to discover in the description or the review why it cost almost $10,000,000.  I was a little uneasy since returns on DVD' and CD's are typically for replacement only, not a refund.  If it were eBay I might offer something like 5 mil and skip the elephant camouflage or the Denon cables until next week.",1297468800,3,434,4.468354430379747
8413843,5,B0042LDQRW,"The most that I can say about this that Joey Lawrence has created an amazingly loving and moving portrait of a vanishing culture that will stay with me for a very long time.

His warm and unaffected manner moved me to admiration - but not the kind that you'd expect.  He has such passion in showing us this fascinating culture.  And his talents come centrally from his deep and abiding humanity and his willingness to connect with the subjects of his photography in a way that I have never seen.  At one point, I was ultimately moved to tears watching this documentary.  It was a reaction that took me by surprise.

Wherever you are, Joey, my hat's off to you...thank you.",1290556800,7,672,4.512396694214876
