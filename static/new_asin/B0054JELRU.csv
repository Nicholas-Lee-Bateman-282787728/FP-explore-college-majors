Now it appears that the boys at CBS are just as unfair to the fans regarding the DVD release.  I guess CBS feels that it is only right to make the fans of this show suffer more by paying more for this series than other CBS releases on DVD.  They are charging 30% for this release and for fewer episodes.  I see that Blue Bloods and Hawaii ZERO (sorry Five O - I was thinking of quality) are priced at $ 38 while Defenders is $ 50.  I am certain when it is all said and done the same network know nothings who said it was a ratings decision will somehow justify their lack of intelligence by saying ""you see...the DVDs did not sell either"".  They will not mention that they overpriced the product to get that result.",1314403200,19,870,4.046783625730995
4568774,5,B0054JELRU,"It mystifies me sometimes how network suits and others in the TV hiearchy can be so completely dumb and callous.  ""The Defenders"" was a good and spirited piece of TV entertainment.  It would've worked had it not been shuttled around like an unwanted stepchild from time slot to time slot.  It never had a chance to build an audience.  CBS saw to that.  They were so heavily into pushing ""Blue Bloods"" last season that they just kicked The Defenders to curb and left it floundering.  Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against ""Blue Bloods"" but It just steams me how good entertainment gets the shaft.  The cast for The Defenders was first-rate and the writing was excellent.  Some of the cases were kind of quirky but hey, it was Vegas.

Belushi and O'Connell were a good team.  Jurnee Smollett is an underrated actress and I hope she gets more roles worthy of her talent.  It was also good to see Glynn Turman again in his semi-regular as one the judges who presided over some the cases.  I'll be buying the DVD as a testament to a brilliant show that never got a fair shake.",1314144000,27,1074,4.479381443298969
8456722,5,B0054JELRU,"This was an awesome show and should never have been cancelled, but with the idiocy of most successful t.v. shows I am not surprised it was, as the humor, relationships, and connecting plots are above the average persons brain capacity. Jim Belushi is at his best here.",1484352000,3,268,4.723404255319149
8456723,5,B0054JELRU,"Gotta have it! This is such a fun series to just sit down with my Honey and a pizza and laugh the night away! Very sexy, intriguing, funny, serious, endearing, and absolutely entertaining show. We both love it.",1445040000,,210,4.552631578947368
8456724,5,B0054JELRU,favourite series. rare to find in stores,1420934400,,40,4.857142857142857
8456725,4,B0054JELRU,"Kind of a throw back show with modern look and subject matter. Great chemistry by the two leads and well executed episodes. And you get some surprises like a deleted scene here or there. So that's fun. Didn't notice a play all episodes feature so if it's there, it's not as apparent as on some other CBS/Paramount releases.",1412208000,,323,4.586206896551724
8456726,5,B0054JELRU,"Met Jim Belushi while he was waiting to find out if they'd been renewed for another season...but sadly all the great shows seem to get cancelled.

I just wish I could find this at a price I can afford so I can rewatch it.",1353715200,,221,4.0227272727272725
8456727,5,B0054JELRU,"I recommend it! Great actors, great cases every episode. It's a shame that show ended. One more reason you by de dvd.",1353369600,,117,4.363636363636363
8456728,5,B0054JELRU,This show was funny and good at the same time - I don't know why it was cancelled - These two guys were great together !!!! Excellent !!!! I could watch 10 seasons of the Defenders !!,1336176000,,183,3.972972972972973
8456729,5,B0054JELRU,"I agree that this was a great show. I am not a big fan of lawyer shows, and the few I've seen have fed the popular image that all lawyers are rats out for their own pocketbooks and uninterested in justice. This show portrayed them as real people who might even feel justice was a high calling. I missed a number of the episodes due to CBS's schedule shifting, and then waited in vain hope that the price would come down, and have now missed my chance to buy the set ($999? Really?). All they did by limiting the number of copies available was to put all the copies on the shelves of the ""ticketmasters"" of the DVD world. Those of us who really appreciated the show and would have liked a copy are left out in the cold. Thanks a lot, CBS (sarcasm intended)!",1322265600,5,756,4.220689655172414
8456730,5,B0054JELRU,"Belushi and O'Connell are a great team as Las Vegas's hottest and smartest lawyers.
It is a shame series was not renewed.
Hopefully FOX or HBO will get smart and put this team back together.",1320451200,10,190,4.457142857142857
8456731,5,B0054JELRU,"This show gets better and better and better each week (each minute). And that's a frightening thought, since it started out so good in the first place. In each episode, they find a way to touch you intellectually and emotionally. This show is a creative milestone and deserves to be rewarded as such.",1320364800,5,300,4.679245283018868
