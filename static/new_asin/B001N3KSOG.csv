8323074,5,B001N3KSOG,"I have watched this film several times, participating in community showings, and each time a different ""voice"" grabs my attention. A transforming moment for me: when the eloquent and inspiring Graylan Hagler tells a DC crowd that--""whether it was myth or real""--we (people of conscience) believe in and will uphold what we were told America stands for. Also unforgettable: when Adele Welty speaks about her hope that people she observes, standing on the sidelines and laughing at anti-war demonstrators, do not live to regret their cynicism ... Then there's the woman outside the Sunday TV talk show doors, who explains that what bothered her about the ramp up to the war was the absence of real debate. She's talking about the media but also the community. I can't forget feeling that it was not safe to speak out against the wild idea of responding to 9/11 with a massive attack on a country that had not attacked us ... Today, President Obama has closed Guantanamo Bay prison camp. I'm grateful and I'm thinking how important it is to remember that for eight long years, in an era that only ended a few days ago, peace, justice and our future were slipping from our fingers--rapidly and dramatically. Finding Our Voices is an indispensible film, especially now, if we want to keep a grip on what democracy requires and how dark things can be if we don't speak up, commit to engage and remain involved ...",1232582400,,1407,4.770491803278689
8323075,5,B001N3KSOG,"""Finding Our Voices"" is aptly titled, for often those of us who disagree with a governmental policy are too timid to let our voices be heard. This film follows the courageous efforts of individuals who have not only found their voices but have used them to demonstrate the patriotic duty of all Americans to speak out against injustices committed by leaders of our beloved country.",1231891200,,381,4.876923076923077
8323076,5,B001N3KSOG,"""Finding Our Voices"" is an important piece of film-making not only for analyzing the lead-up to our debacle in Iraq, but in emphasizing the importance of civil discourse, civil disobedience, and questioning our political leaders and journalist class who prefer to ""present points of view"" rather than argue them persuasively and welcome dialogue.  The film covers several different individuals who ""found their voice"" due to very different circumstances, underlining the argument that we are a nation of many loyal, thoughtful voices.  It is a powerful presentation and one that will remain relevant in the future.~EMB",1231718400,,618,5.494736842105263
8323077,4,B001N3KSOG,"Finding Our Voices should be part of our HS Social Studies, or what used to be Civics, curriculum.  With delft storytelling of real people's experiences since 9/11, the filmmakers reconnect us with the most basic tenet, that of the Right to openly protest and raise our voices for what we believe in.  A lesson that has been lacking these past 8 years and one that was so clearly displayed in the presidential election in 2008.  I highly recommend this film, whether you are into political documentaries or not because, a good story is a good story...even when it's true.",1231459200,,571,4.747474747474747
8323078,5,B001N3KSOG,"My brother-in-law sent me this DVD for a holiday present -- and it was one of the best gifts I have received in the past 30 years. My initial reaction from reading the DVD jacket was that it was simply a film to document peace rallies, like the ones I remember from the 1960s and 1970s. I was glad to be wrong on this count -- Finding Our Voices is a very dramatic and insightful study of people from different walks of life who not only found their voices but found their courage.

I believe that one has to admire any individual who feels strongly about an issue and makes the commitment to advocate for the issue publicly - even at the expense of reputation, employment, or name-calling. I found myself empathizing with most of the characters (called the Voices) especially Adele, who lost her brave son, a firefighter, on 9/11. You can feel her pain while marveling at her strength and dedication to the cause of peace in the context of her son's memory.

After viewing this excellent film and wiping away my tears, I have followed in my brother-in-law's footsteps and have purchased DVDs for close friends and family members as gifts that are much more meaningful than a sweater, bottle of wine or after shave. The film has also energized me to identify and sign up for a cause I could feel strongly about and support. I recommend you do the same on all counts.",1231459200,,1366,4.504032258064516
8323079,5,B001N3KSOG,"I'm not much for politics but at least I vote and always Republican. President Bush's Iraq war though made me stop and take a hard look at our country's politics and why we go to war in the first place. This film, more liberal than I'm comfortable with, showed me how lefties might see the war and frankly, I respect the humanity of the people in the film. For me it raises questions about what it means to be a strong country and a Christian country in one sentence and that's too big a topic to get into here. But, see the film. It's worth it.",1231459200,,545,4.150943396226415
