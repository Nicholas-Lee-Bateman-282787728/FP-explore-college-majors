7915989,3,B00002NDKX,"Those who wish to see the complete Escaflowne, which runs over 11 hours in length, should pass up this abridged three-tape box set and watch the full-length, uncut, eight-tape box set instead.
Reading the reviews below, I see that the three positive reviews seem to refer to the complete 26-episode Escaflowne. The lone negative review appears to refer to this three-hour abridged ""best collection."" Make of that what you will.",969753600,7,427,5.114285714285714
7915990,5,B00002NDKX,"In a sense it's criminal that this series was released with as little fanfare as it was, because this is simply one of the most fantastic series I've ever seen, animated or live-action.  The scope, storyline, characters,  art direction and music are simply breathtaking.  This is a beautiful blend  of technology, sorcery and mythology that will grip you and not let you go  until the very end.  Like many anime series, it's a love triangle set  amongst incredible stories and locales.  And on top of it all, the blending  of traditional drawn animation with computer animation is often superb, if  not superior.  I recommend this set with the same vigor that I do the  ""Magic Knights Rayearth"" set--it's that good. Action, technology,  magic, romance...Escaflowne has it all.",955324800,2,776,5.015748031496063
7915991,5,B00002NDKX,"Director Kazuki Akane's ""the vision of Escoflowne"" box set is the greatest collection I have ever seen.  The animation is breathtaking and the music really sets the mood.  Even if you have never watched  Japanese animation you sould still check it out.  It has romance, action,  adventure, great music, and some of the best animation ever.",953856000,,339,4.982142857142857
7915992,5,B00002NDKX,"For anyone out there who watches Japanese Animation, this is a must have, no two ways about it.  The story is the most involving one that I have ever encountered in ANYTHING, not just animation.  It has something for  everyone!  Action, adventure, anger, love, beauty, emotion.  I own the  entire series and believe that there is not a single episode out of all 26  that was less than amazing.  The art in these tapes simply increadible.  The character design is without a doubt ingenious.  I have never seen Mechs  done so well, not even in Gundam.  The score for these tapes is another  story all together!  I own 2 out of 3 soundtracks for this series and it is  probably some of the best and most emotional score out of any movie that I  have ever heard. Take it from a long time Anime collector, this is  definatly worth your time.  I especially recommend it to anyone who thought  that Record of Lodoss Wars was good.  (You haven't seen anything yet! )",948585600,,958,4.459302325581396
