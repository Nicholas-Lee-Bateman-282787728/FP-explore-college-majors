2384373,4,B000AC7P60,"Originally released as La Marca del Hombre-lobo (1968), aka The Mark of the Wolfman, this Spanish horror production found great popularity on the American drive-in circuit under the title Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (1972), distributed by producer Sam Sherman through his company Independent International Pictures, which was the company primarily responsible for inflicting Al Adamson's brand of cinematic pain on unsuspecting movie patrons with such features like Satan's Sadists (1969) and Dracula Vs. Frankenstein (1971).  Directed by Enrique L?pez Eguiluz, the movie was written (and starred in) by Jacinto Molina, better known to his many fans as Paul Naschy (The Werewolf Versus Vampire Women, Doctor Jekyll and the Werewolf, Curse of the Devil), a prolific actor/writer/director/producer sometimes referred to as `the Spanish Lon Chaney' due to his penchant for playing the monster in a great many European horror films (this was the first in a lengthy series of wolf man films featuring Naschy).  Also appearing is Manuel Manzaneque (Hotel T?voli), Dyanik Zurakowska (Terror of the Living Dead), Juli?n Ugarte (All the Colors of the Dark), and Aurora de Alba (Vengeance of the Zombies).

Naschy plays Count Waldemar Daninsky, a man who becomes enthralled with a local woman named Countess Janice von Aarenberg (Zurakowska) who has recently returned home from school.  Seems the Countess already has a suitor named Rudolph Weissmann (Manzaneque), but Waldemar's manly charms prove too strong so Rudi gets the boot.  Meanwhile, a couple gypsies (one overly laden with bosom...homina homina) seek refuge in a nearby abandoned monastery to wait out a storm and discover an underground crypt.  Being the opportunistic sort, the gypsies decide to relieve the occupants of the crypt of their valuables, but in the process one of them makes the unwitting mistake of pulling a silver cross/dagger from the chest of a well-preserved corpse, thereby unleashing the curse of the werewolf upon the land once again...smooth move, Ex-Lax.  The subsequent maulings lead the villagers to believe wolves have come down from the mountains, so they form a hunting party, including Waldemar and Rudi, the latter soon suffering an attack from the hairy, toothy, slavering beast recently brought back from the dead.  Waldemar saves the day (and Rudi), his reward a good-sized bite to the chest prior to putting the creature down.  Both Rudi and Janice vow to help the now cursed Waldemar, scouring the monastery for any information, eventually coming across a correspondence from a Dr. Janos Mikhelov to the original wolf man.  Apparently the good doctor has since passed, but his son, who shares the same name, has taken up his father's work and agrees to help the despondent Waldemar, arriving in short order with his really hot wife (who, like the gypsy woman, is loaded with bosom), both of whom prefer to work only at night...and here's where things get weird...turns out the doctor and his wife are a pair of swinging vampires, and while I'm unsure what their plans for Waldemar involve, there's no mistaking their interest or intent for both Rudi or Janice...

The one thing many people will notice while watching this film is while it has both wolf men and vampires, there's no Frankenstein monster anywhere to be found, which is curious given fact the name Frankenstein is so predominant in the title.  Apparently distributor Sherman had promised a Frankenstein film, and when he couldn't come up with one, he did the next best thing by tacking on a Frankenstein angle to this import, adding a bit of narration up front trying to marry both the Frankenstein and wolf man mythos together, the result being a plot point that makes no sense.  Actually, there were a few areas in the plot that were a bit fuzzy, but I attributed much of this to the actual Spanish to English transition.  The trick here is to not get so hung up on various story details, otherwise you'll end up missing out on the aspects that made this feature as much fun as it was, specifically the natural atmosphere, the location shots, the vibrant visuals, and the monsters.  The inclusion of the vampires seemed odd, but not unwelcome.  The movie has a really strong gothic vibe throughout, primarily due to the extensive location shots populated with appropriate set pieces.  The performances were better than I expected, and I especially liked how Naschy took it to the hilt during his transformation sequences (check out the muscular physique on Naschy during his shirtless scenes...someone had been pumping the iron).  The actual transformation sequences themselves were strictly low budget, as they basically involved someone moving a smudged filter in front of the camera's lens, but it came off pretty effective.  I particularly liked the fangs on Naschy's wolf man, as they were quite the honking set of choppers.  The actual eviscerations aren't shown, but these sequences are handled in such a way as you get a pretty good idea what's going on, even if you don't see the rendering of flesh.  As far as action goes, there's a few lusty maulings, some monster on monster stuff (ever wonder who'd win in a fight between an werewolf and a vampire?), neck biting, impalements, and so on...there was one sequence I found pretty funny, and that was when the wolf man broke into a meager dwelling and attacked the two residents.  He went after the man first, and then pounced on the woman (given the attractiveness of the woman, she would have probably been the one I would have went after first).  After beating on the man for a bit, the beast picked him up and chucked him on an open fire, to which the poor fellow landed seat first, did a little bouncing around, and then spewed blood from his mouth.  It sounds gruesome, but I couldn't help laughing just because it looked so odd.  The liner notes indicate that at some point this film was released in 3-D, and some parts of the movie seem to confirm this as there appears to be an inherent blurriness normally associated with the process, but I guess it didn't go over so well at the time, so that aspect of the release was canned (much of the American promotional materials indicate the movie was shot in Chill-O-Rama, but I'm unsure if that was relating to the 3-D process of something else).

This DVD release from Shriek Show/Media Blasters includes a decent looking, anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture.  There are flaws present (lines, specks, etc.) and the picture, at times, looks a little washed out, but for the most part, it came across well enough.  The Dolby Digital audio track also wasn't spectacular, as the audio level seemed to fade in and out at times, but was serviceable for the most part.  There are a good deal of extras including a commentary track with Sam Sherman, who was the U.S. distributor, TV and radio spots, deleted and extended scenes, an original trailer, a photo gallery, and interview with Paul Naschy, liner notes by George Reis of the DVD Drive-in website, and trailers for other films including The Being (1983), Just Before Dawn (1981), Anthropophagus (1981), and Golden Temple Amazons (1973).  My only beef with this release is it would have been nice if the original version of this film had been included, but perhaps that wasn't available.

2384374,3,B000AC7P60,"Not Frankenstein's, that's for sure.  Actually the producers (or distributors or somebody) justified the title with a bit of pre-credits explanation, and it's a charming example of the kind of low-rent showmanship that typifies the old drive-in movie culture.

As for the movie itself, it isn't as bad as its reputation portends.  Actually it was a pretty big hit, big enough to usher in the whole Naschy/Daninsky cycle of werewolf/vampire flicks in the 70's.

If one has a taste for this kind of fare at all, one can't help but be charmed by the garish colors, bad dubbing, and histrionic acting that were the mainstays of so many European horror flicks of the era.

And I love the additional trailers with their bombastic announcers.  Gosh, the days of such innocent trash are missed.

P.S.  The most terrifying thing about this movie is how the beautiful leading lady can fall so easily in love with Naschy, a homely middle-aged dude with a bad wig.  Yikes!!!!!",1146700800,,964,4.829268292682927
2384375,1,B000AC7P60,"This movie does not meet my satisfaction as a horror film. It is pure garbage and silly I cannot understand why other people gave this trash a 5 star. For fans of horror movies please check out these original classics: Boris Karloff's 1931 Frankenstein, Bella Lugusi's 1931 Dracula, Lon Chaney Jr.'s 1943 The Wolfman and fianlly if you are into European horror films check out Hammer's Horror Classics which includes Dracula, Wolfman and etc. If you must purchase this film I recommend that you rent it first otherwise it is waste of your hard earned money.",1143936000,,557,4.8125
2384376,5,B000AC7P60,"After many long years of searching in frustration and dissapointment, fans of LA MARCA DEL HOMBRE LOBO have this classic of  euro-horror on an excellent quality DVD.

I've previously purchased copies of this film on VHS and on DVD, and found both the picture quality and sound to be terrible.  Media Blasters however, has done great justice to this long lost treasure. The video transfer is great, and the sound is much better than other versions I've purchased.  If you have any of those other copies of this film, throw them in the trash, and get this Media Blasters version.

This was not the most well written or acted horror film of all time, but it has some of the most atmospheric sets, color, cinematography and sound.  A few scenes were stunningly well staged.  It's not Lord of the Rings or Hamlet, but it's just very good escapism for fans of 1960s-70s European Horror.

Many people wonder, and rightly so, about the fact that neither Dr. Frankenstein nor his creation appear in this movie.  As the insert in the DVD case and other sources document, the American distributor of this film was committed to releasing a Frankenstein movie.  He had bought ads and made commitments to theaters, then found that the studio sent him a werewolf film. In a rather silly effort to ""explain"" this oddity, he had an animation short tagged on the opening credits showing the Frankenstein monster changing into a werewolf, while a voice over told the audience that the Frankenstein family had fallen victim to lycanthropy and were now known as ""Wolfstein"". None of that has anything to do with what actually happens in the film what-so-ever, but it was cause for amusement, which only added to the popularity of the cult classic.  This is one of those films that you either say ""I don't get it"" and hate it, or you fall in love with it for reasons that might be hard to explain.

This DVD version has good quality picture and sound.  It also is loaded with entertaining extras.  Well worth buying.",1139616000,6,1994,4.692528735632184
2384377,5,B000AC7P60,"The first in a long running series of werewolf films is presented here in widescreen format, which is a big plus and a revelation to those of us who have only seen the awful cropped prints.

The extras are fantastic, especially the commentary by Sam Sherman and the easter egg featuring the recording session of the advertising campaign (easily found).

 The only downside is that while the film was shot in 3-D and the elements still exist, this presentation is strictly flat only, but as Sherman says in the commentary he'd love to re-release the 3-D version to midnight shows!

To the person who complained the Paul Naschy interview is only in Spanish.... Sir, turn on the English subtitles!!! The interview is subtitled. LOL.",1132099200,13,729,4.854838709677419
2384378,5,B000AC7P60,"For those who recall the great days of low budget B movies on late night T.V., here's a great 2:30 in the morning classic I grew up with that's never seen an official stateside release until now. A fun, old fashioned gothic horror film with a hilarious misleading cartoon prolog explaining the Frankenstein in the title, and funny enough, past a certain point in the film you either forget there's no Frankenstein, or don't care! Still, you got werewolves, vampires, great cinematography, old castles, lots of atmosphere, creepy music, it more than makes up for it. The first, and best of the Paul Naschy werewolf films, finally getting the letterboxed (did I forget to mention it's in 70mm?) deluxe treatment it deserves.",1132012800,6,722,4.926229508196721
2384379,5,B000AC7P60,"I've been waiting for this one for years. I fell in love with this film years ago when it was one of those creature feature films on late saturday nights in the late 70's. Apart from the silly and misleading title, as a horror film this is damn near perfect. This film has a great plot, beautiful use of color and lighting and an awesome gothic backdrop. This was the first film to star Paul Naschy as the werewolf and it was most definately his best. I have been buying different versions of this film on both DVD and VHS for many years and all have been disappointing either in content or sound and picture quality. To be honest, most of them were unwatchable. This DVD is just beautiful. The colors are bold and vivid and the picture quality is near perfect for a film of this age. This is also a longer cut of the U.S. version i remember seeing on TV all those years ago. Many of these scenes were available only on the original Spanish version of the film, La Marca del Hombre Lobo or Mark Of The Wolfman. I have two versions of this on VHS but one of them is in German and the other in  Spanish. These unfortunately both had very, very poor audio and video. Here most of those scenes were added back to the U.S. version and dubbed in English. These scenes fit perfectly into the shorter version i remember and make this classic even better. If you are a fan of this film and have purchased any different versions of it in the past, throw them all out and buy this DVD. It put them all to shame. This is the ultimate euro horror film and it has never looked better. Thank you Media Blasters and Shreik Show for doing such a beautiful job with this long forgotten gem.

8077643,3,B000AC7P60,"Naschy's first Daninsky film, Mark of the Wolf Man, was retitled for the American drive-in audience, so don't expect any Frankenstein in this one.  It's actually much better than you'd expect, although the print used for the DVD is not the best.

The movie takes a while to get going, with a clunky love story and not enough Naschy.  Eventually he's bitten by a resurrected werewolf ancestor and the fun begins.  Naschy's frothing wolf man is terrific.  There's some great use of color and atmospheric effects (if only the print were better!) that make up for the deficiencies in character and story.

I will say that the left-turn that the plot takes in the second half was not something I would have expected.  Quite enjoyable.",1416960000,,729,4.784
8077644,5,B000AC7P60,"The producers of the latter shown flick Dracula VS Frankenstein had their film essentially held hostage by the firm that was in charge of making the multiple prints of the film to be released so they instead released (after editing a slow beginning and inserting a tie-in to Frankenstein so they could release said theme on schedule) the first Paul Naschy Wolfman film. This could be on of the luckiest accidents in entertainment history as the misnamed ""Frankenstein's Bloody Horror"" is a terrific movie with Naschy's character battling another werewolf (no doubt the inspiration for a similar scene in the recent Wolfman remake of the Lon Chaney Jr. flick) as well as a couple of vampires! As atmospheric as these type of fi
lms get and an all around winner. Naschy would go on to play reboots of his Wolfman in films of different continuities though some were indeed direct sequels to earlier ones. Ironically one film usually known as Assignment; Terror which features Naschy's Wolfman is also known as Dracula VS Frankenstein and was misleading with it's title! Eventually the ""real"" Dracula VS Frankenstein was released but it didn't hold a candle to Fran kenstein's Bloody Terror. The DVD extras explain all this in greater detail than I can here. If you like the old school Universal and Hammer monster movies your going to love this one!",1400112000,,1346,4.907894736842105
8077645,4,B000AC7P60,"One of those so bad it's awful Euro horror films from the late 60s-early 70s era.  This mishmash has more ingredients than a Spanish paella.  A Spanish-made dubbed into English mess involving a werewolf, a couple of innocents that want to help him, and a pair of vampires putting the bite on everyone.  I don't know where the title of Frankenstein fits in but at one point the male vampire starts experimenting on the wolfman.  I'm not sure why, perhaps to make a better, more obedient monster.  Check out the beehive hairdo on the female vampire.  Other than that the picture is excellent and the color is magnificent.  Worth getting for that alone.",1388534400,,650,4.699115044247788

8077648,5,B000AC7P60,"FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR is a landmark in Spanish filmmaking. It not only helped to initiate the Gothic Horror resurgeance in Spain, but it also launched the career of one of Spain's most prolific actors and filmmakers: Jacinto Molina (AKA ""Paul Naschy""). Two gypsies unwittingly unleash the werewolf Imre Wolfstein from his grave by removing a silver stake from his heart. When their bodies are discovered, a hunting party lead by Count Waldemar Daninsky heads out to destroy what they think is a bloodthirsty animal, but Daninsky is bitten by the werewolf and becomes afflicted with the curse himself. Seeking a cure, he travels to visit a doctor specializing in occult remedies, but Waldemar soon discovers himself in the midst of two scheming vampires that plan to pit him against the wolf that made him! Molina stars as the chauvinistic Count Waldemar Daninsky in a role that he would return to eleven times in the decades to follow. A life-long fan of the Universal Monsters, Molina incorporates many familiar plot elements and stylistic devices used in films like THE WOLF MAN to shape his own Gothic classic. Although his acting is unrefined, Molina truly transforms as he becomes ""El Hombre Lobo,"" The Wolf Man. He brings a raw energy and bestial rage to the role that has made him an international icon in Horror cinema. Considering the miniscule budget, Molina and director Enrique Lpez Eguiluz manage to include a series of astounding set pieces along with a terrifying mood that haunts the accursed hallways of Castle Wolfstein. FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR is essential viewing for Gothic Horror fans, and one of Molina's finer films.

8077649,4,B000AC7P60,"This film has nothing to do with Frankenstein.  It deals with werewolves and vampires.  The actual name is La marca del Hombre-lobo (1968).

It is a romp.  You have the medieval castle and town; you have crypts, grave robbers, romance, parental concern, and a beautiful woman.

Of course, you have two men who are in love with her-one upstanding country club sort and the other man who is dark, mysterious and with a reputation -a real European playboy.

The story is well written.  The sets are detailed and just plain rich in European airs.  The cast is superb.

The film begins slow, but picks up as the characters are introduced.  Comedic elements are tossed in with good measure with the two gypsies who seek shelter from the storm inside the old castle.  They sense there is treasure to be found and unwittingly, unleash the impaled count who immediately goes on a murderous rampage as a werewolf.

The hunt with the dogs is well crafted.  Nighttime in a forest hunting wolves is played out to the evitable end.

The two men who love the same woman become friends.  Of course, the woman chooses the man who is destined never to find true love in this life.

One night a man and woman arrive in the fog clouded train in answer to the plea for help.  Unfortunately, the man and woman are vampires with their own agenda.

Ultimate sacrifice has to be made by the woman and her true love.  The ending is satisfactory for this type of film.",1266537600,,1441,4.536964980544747
