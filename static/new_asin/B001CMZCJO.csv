8344077,5,B001CMZCJO,"First available on VHS, this transfer to DVD is most welcome, as it provides the viewer with an opportunity to learn about North Dakota's famous epic poet Thomas McGrath, with sequences at a rural steam traction engine show, formal readings, and dream-like montages of sequences from the poetry.  McGrath and his poetry and this film ought to be known far beyond his native State, in high schools and colleges everywhere.  Mike Hazard's documentary project The CIE has also produced and distributes important films on other neglected Midwestern writers.",1354838400,2,553,5.2727272727272725
8344078,4,B001CMZCJO,"A great and overlooked American poet captured in live readings, poetry videos, and other documentary footage.  A bit dated in feel and production, this film still captures essential elements of the poet and his art; and for that, it is of great value.",1344643200,,251,4.837209302325581
