894077,5,6304494378,"Full disclosure: I've been a Stern fan since he took down John DeBella down in Philly in the early 80's. I may give him higher marks than someone who did not grow up hearing his voice back when his show was groundbreaking and funny.

The movie is at times sweet and funny, and works pretty well as a tongue-in-cheek biopic. Most of the cringe worthy dirt from the book is scrubbed out of this story, and that's probably for the best. Did we really want to see depictions of Howard's problems with underwear and anal fissures that are such a big part of the book?

It's sad and dripping with irony that Howie managed to become Don Imus before retiring. His new politically correct show, bereft of whack packers, is boring and unfunny, sure... but that should not factor into anyone's score of this movie as a stand-alone project. As a movie, it works and is more entertaining than 50% of what Hollywood produces under the banner of comedy.",1502496000,,938,4.544378698224852

Preface

Howard Stern is the man who had enough vision, (whether it was accidentally acquired or not) to realize that all he had to do to attain huge success as a radio personality was to just be himself.  Howards self is probably a lot like yours and mine, sleazy at the core, immature, perverted, and with a slimy curiosity of things that are better not discussed in our society.  Yet Howard lets it all fly - whether its his flatulence fascination or his attraction to all things lesbian.  The reason for his success is that his listeners feel a connection to Stern through their egos seedy side, and therefore Howard becomes their mouthpiece.

the plot

Howard Stern realized that he wanted to have a career in radio ever since he was five years old.  He grew an interest when he was so young through going to his fathers radio station.  His father Ben Stern was an engineer in a Manhattan-based station while the family lived in Roosevelt, Long Island.  He had shown an interest in entertaining people also at an early age.  He would perform puppet shows at retirement homes, and when he was older he attended Boston University and graduated in the mid 70s.

He started getting disc jockey gigs after college, but went virtually unnoticed.  His confidence was low, and his skill was shaky at best.  With the help of his wifes criticism and some fate-filled accidents, he then started to feel his way behind the microphone and as he relaxed he was able to be himself more.  He moved around the north east a lot when he was early in his career, and then he finally moved to Washington DC, it is here where he started to get noticed.  He was paired up with Robin Quivers, his newswoman/sidekick in DC.  When WNBC saw that their audience was disappearing, they figured it was Stern as the reason why.  So in haste, without even hearing Stern on the radio, they hired him for the afternoon drive time slot.

When they got to know Sterns crass brand of humor, they wanted to get rid of him, but because they signed a contract with him, they would have to pay him millions if they decided to fire him.  So they were stuck with him, but that didn't mean that they couldn't try and tame the DJ.  NBC Management put office lackey Kenny Rushton on Stern to try and either neuter him or make him so crazy that hell decide to quit. This turned into a major battle between Stern and NBC.  Who will win?  Is this the end of Sterns career?  Are these questions silly because most of us know how the story turns out?  Find out when you watch Private Parts.

the breakdown

I love bio-pics, don't you?  Doesnt everybody?  I thought so.  Well, we like it when they're done right anyway.  There are some great biopics out there, yet none really come to mind right now of one where the subjected persona was played by themselves.  Howard Stern takes on the role of Howard Stern from his college years and on, and he does a perfect job.  It makes me think of the Seinfeld episode when he was casting for his sitcom Jerry and his next-door neighbor Kramer comes in to audition for the part of Kramer.  It sounds easy enough, but in the end it means that you're going to have to know how to act.  Kramer may not know how to act like Kramer, but Stern delivers a very believable Stern.  Even more impressive is his ability to play himself on the radio when he wasn't that good.  He gives himself an on-air voice, which sounds like Kermit the Frog, and banter, which is laughable and embarrassing especially when you compare it with the Howard we all know, and respect.  Well maybe 'respect' is too strong a word.

This film marks Paul Giamattis first major role as far as I can tell.  He portrays WNBC lackey Kenny Pig Vomit Rushton, and he also nails the character as a sniveling, two-faced, double-crossing rat that he was (according to Stern in his autobiography of the same name).  If you were a listener of Sterns show back in the 1990s when he was still married to his first wife Alison, you got to know her pretty good, and although Mary McCormack is much cooler than the real Alison Stern, she still comes off as authentic somehow.  Mary McCormack, like Giamatti was virtually unknown when she was cast in this role.  Marys super good looks do not even seem to clash with Sterns ogre-like appearance somehow, in fact her radiant appearance even seems to compliment Stern and makes him look more attractive than he is.

If you are familiar with Stern, youll probably expect to see a couple of naked ladies, and/or some lesbians, and youd be correct.  Yet even though porn star Jenna Jameson is so naked in this film, and although her nudity is oh-so gratuitous, its also completely in context.  Speaking of Jenna, there are many cameos in Private Parts that needed to be seen as we go through the years of Howards life  including John Stamos, Dee Snyder, Ozzy Osbourne, Flavor Flav, Slash, AC/DC, Mia Farrow and even Tiny Tim.

This is a sleazy film, yet it is also inspiring.  It could be offensive, yet its hilarious too.  This movie is the perfect compliment to what Howard s show used to be, its fun, entertaining, funny, and yet not for everybody.  I miss Howard in the morning as I don't have a subscription to Satellite radio, but my memories are mostly fond.  I remember there was talk back sometime before 2004 that there would be a sequel made that included his run for governor, his move to K-Rock and more.  Maybe this why the ending seems a bit anti-climatic.  To remedy this, maybe he should do a sequel giving us a real excuse to fork up $10 a month to hear him on his SIRIUS radio station.  This film desperately needs a facelift as far as the DVD is concerned.  The aspect ratio is widescreen yet it lacks a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Hopefully this will make its way to the blu-ray format soon.

895188,5,6304494378,"In the 1980s and 1990s, I did not appreciate Howard Stern and his sexist remarks and behavior in the media.  He sure had gotten the attention he wanted, and I thought he was simply a jerk.  As with many, I knew nothing about his personal life, but disliked him because of his media personality.  In this movie, he is depicted as a really nice guy who loves his wife and very loyal to his co-workers.  I saw this film at a young age, and didn't quite appreciate it because I thought it was a fake display of his real life in order to change the minds of the audience about who he is as a real person.  However, seeing Howard Stern in other capacities these days, not as a disk jockey, but as a tv personality, I believe this movie is genuine about his struggles to make it big in the media.  The movie gets five stars because the acting was good, the story line explains a lot, and it brings out a lot of emotions: funny, angry, sad, etc.  The chronological story-telling makes it easy to understand, and it was interesting to  see the ups and downs of his life just like any other lives.  Well done.",1446681600,,1099,4.2451923076923075

896202,5,6304494378,"The golden voice of radio, or as he likes to call himself The King of All Media, Howard Stern, has proven in this movie ""Private Parts"" time and time again: ""trash is gold.""

In this 1997 movie Private Parts starring the King of All Media, Stern, and his cohorts, Robin Quiver, Jackie ""The Joker Man"" Martling, Struttering John, Bababooyee, etc., retells Howard Sterns climb to stardom ending up on top of the Big Apple. From his neighborhoods on Long island to Boston University, where he met his wife Alison, to Detroit radio, to Washington DC radio, and finally back to the Big Apple, NYC, radio this movie shows his drive and the obstacles, like Pig Vomit, a radio executive who dislikes him, he faced on his quest for stardom.

This movie is about his determination, and his vision of giving the public what they truly want: they want: to laugh. To make his listeners laugh: Stern uses sex.

Sex fuels his on air conversation. Sex sells; and Stern knows it. Even though the radio executives are concerned about his foul mouth and being censored by the federal government, once they see his ratings, which go through the roof in the early and mid-1980s, they realize they have a radio super talent in their mist.  Many are listening and chuckling at Stern's sex antics on the radio. It's all an act, yet the most popular act in NYC, then around the country. The formula to Stern's success is sex,And he continues to rant about sexual taboo topics. Like the 1950s comic, Lenny Bruce, Stern is sex obsessed, yet unlike the comic Lenny Bruce, Stern had struck gold.

Thirty-three  years after his NYC radio debut, in 1982, the movie was released in 1997, Stern is still a big star today.  His success and drive back then when he first graduate college in the mid-1970s has kept him in the public eye today. Even though he has toned down his act on TV, Stern is still a celebrity.

In the movie, it seems as if Stern's fundamental belief is that his radio audience find European classical arts, like Mozart, boring: he believes his audience want to be excited and entertained. Cheap thrills means trash is gold. And he delivers by using sex. As a result, he ends up with spectacularly high radio ratings, and becomes a nationally media superstar.

As a movie, Private Parts is basically a biography. It could have been named the Howard Stern's Life Story. The movie also shows how he succeeded and rose to the top of his profession. How? He chatted about sex. In a puritanical society, such talk is trash, yet for Stern, as a result, trash turned into gold. He became a media superstar, or as he likes to say King of all Media.

As a movie, this one is a very good biography of someone who had climbed successfully and reached national stardom. For Howard Stern fans, this movie is a can't miss. If not a Stern fan, it's still worth watching.

Stern's climb to dizzying heights of celebrity stardom simply reflects how in our culture: trash is gold. That ideal  has been proven  time and time again: give the public what it wants, make that burger with fries, and where's the TV guide?

As far as the acting, Stern plays himself, and his acting is plausible, good enough. So is the acting of his cohorts. It's a fun movie to watch. More exciting culturally for many than listening and watching the Vienna orchestra perform Mozart's Magic Flute. Stern has tapped into the national consciousness of giving to he public what it wants. On the radio and screen. does the public want Rock n' Roll? Of course.. Beethoven? No. Howard Stern? Yes.",1441152000,,3537,4.620414673046252

viewers today of America's Got Talent, for example, will love this (even with the four letter words and bathroom humour). they might not understand what his Sirius / past Channel 9 in New York) show is all about but this is a very good deal for new fans.

""But, Anne,"" I can hear you asking, ""didn't you give this a 5-star rating? That makes no sense?!""

Here's the thing - yes, there is raunch, and nudity in this movie, but for the most part it is actually part of the story, and it is, believe it or not, a love story, and a lovely and funny one (of course, he's now divorced from her - but that doesn't detract from the movie).

896630,4,6304494378,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Big fan since DC 101 days and the 'let it all out' format leads listeners to believe they have a clue about his life. I recall thinking this confidently until I read a very obscure clip in a Palm Springs newspaper that he was divorcing his first wife, wtf? He complained incessantly about his lack of privacy at home, his daughter demanding ice water before bed and things of that nature. However, every married man has marital complaints and the topic did make good radio fodder, especially for the lovelorn henpecked demographic.

I enjoyed this film immensely as the characters were played mostly by themselves with unexpected ability. I had no idea that Howard was so handsome during this timeframe as well as gorgeous Robin.

I appreciate one man's victory to overcome the staid radio format and share more personal information with various ostracized groups. I have never met a porn star and found it fascinating to hear their life adventures. Same with many of the wild, zany characters that littered his program daily.

My biggest disappointment of the script is that it did not portray how he treats his assistants with great disdain. I never found that entertaining but this aspect is an integral part of his show. I know Howard expects perfection but pays poorly and takes advantage of those who are competent. My only real complaint about his persona.

He invites all into a secret world of misfits, outcasts, and miscreants that otherwise would have no voice. I applaud his effort to mainstream the outliers of society and attempt to humanize them. I was extremely shocked and saddened that he remarried, albeit to a beautiful, gracious model, that made the major theme of this film fall flat. He started therapy with the famous Dr. Sarno which relies heavily on expressing your deepest emotions and suppressed rage. I believe this is what precipitated his need to live a different life.

I did not follow his program to satellite radio and have missed his crazy antics but after so many years of the same shock jock tactics, now with the F word, I am bored.

If you were ever a fan of the show this is a delightful Horatio Alger like tale with caveats. Be prepared for blunt discussions on sex and variant behavior.

I felt Mary McCormack's role was so underplayed and mousy. Her voice barely registered and her lines spoken so quickly like a scared cat. Her beauty carried the role but did not suffice to play against such a hard boiled character like Howard. Most likely intentional direction by Thomas as every scene is dubbed with construction noise or traffic, extremely annoying! The FCC story was never mentioned when Howard, supportive of the war post 9/11 (his most memorable broadcast fyi), takes a turn to defile the leaders decisions and suddenly licensing issues prevail.

This film was a delightful surprise in that it portrayed the radio persona well with insight into the personal realm. High Recommend!",1416441600,,2975,4.85207100591716

896987,5,6304494378,"I must confess that I get a huge kick out of Howard, and I loved this movie.  This is the real deal, a slice of how Howard got to be the King of All Media.

Even if you are not a big fan of Howard, you might still like seeing how he had to fight his way to the top of the pile against mainstream media and the FCC.

But if you are a fan of Howard, you will love this movie.  His ex-wife Alison stars as herself, Robin as herself, Babbabooie as himself, and the very talented Fred as himself.  The NBC exec (aka Pig Vomit) is very well done by Paul Giamotti.

You will get to see the very personal sensitive side of Howard on screen.  Too fun, and too funny!

Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.

I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.  Here is the link, it is loads of fun too.

Well......

I remember when this movie was released in 1997. I myself was on-air talent for a radio station. Granted it was college, but there was so much in this movie that I related to. Howard's side-kick Robin did a phenomenal job holding her own against the brash, no-language-filter Stern. Plus, you know, gratuitous nude boobs are thrown in several times because, well, BOOBS! lol

Seriously, though, this movie had a lot more heart to it than I'd expected. The dialogue never feels forced or even scripted, really. Another surprise is that I started to like Stern a little after watching this movie.

Watch with an open mind & try to leave your bias (if you're in the anti-Stern crowd) at the door. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, so turn off your brain & have some laughs & occasional 'goose-bumpy moments'.

I was not overwhelmed with a desire to see it, but my parents, wanted to go to a movie and they heard it was funny. In a nutshell I went, I saw it, I was entertained and made to laugh, which ultimately was the point. A few things you should know.

Howard Stern uses this as a platform to demonstrate how he went from a mild mannered shy individual, to the king of shock. The movie impressed upon the viewer, that in order to make a splash in the ratings world he had to start interjecting both humor and shock value. You will see at point that this has a bit of a personal cost

A personal flaw is demonstrated as well -Howard is often attempting to be funny, but from time to time misses the mark when he does so he does not know when to stop. (this is demonstrated when he is talking to Robin Quivers about the 103rd Army Division)

Overall this movie shows that Howard Stern is a slave to what his market wants, and that ultimately, the personalty he projects un the air is very different than the personality he has with his friends and family. By no means am I suggesting that you will see this movie and run right out and invite Mr. Stern into your home, but this movie will provide the one thing that those individuals and groups that rail against Sterns antics need.

897534,3,6304494378,"Private Parts isn't *nearly* as outrageous as it once was. Yes, back in 1997 this was probably considered a pretty shocking film with many whacky and disrespectful antics on the part of Howard Stern and his cast of misfits, but in todays world -with the variety of films we have today intended solely for shock value- not so much. It's fairly tame in comparison, actually.

Sure, the storyline does a decent job showing you how dysfunctional Howard Stern really is, specifically because of his upbringings (his father kept calling him a moron, for one thing) and the movie does a *very* good job showing you how Stern got into the radio broadcasting business, but the once considered downright *daring* style of comedy that made Stern so popular and innovative back in the day honestly doesn't seem nearly as outrageous as it does today, so Private Parts kind of feels boring and... dare I say, fairly normal, in several spots as a result.

However, I fully realize Howard Stern's dirty and shocking comedic style was completely original at the time- it's just these days we've become *used* to these kind of comedy films dominating much of our movie selections on any number of movie channels, so the best thing a film like Private Parts can accomplish is allowing us to reflect on the days when this kind of disrespectful humor was brand new and actually lived up to its name of being *shocking*.

That doesn't mean I'm calling Stern's style of humor mild or anything- just mild in comparison to the world we live in today. What does this mean for you? It means you shouldn't expect Private Parts to offer anything you haven't already seen over the last 10 years of watching comedy films.  Only one or two moments honestly made me go ""Wow, that's intense!""  One of them being the naked woman who walks into the studio and actually makes out with Stern right there on the floor.  Very shocking.

Now, I'm not sure if every single attempt to shock his radio listeners that we see in the film actually took place or not, but let's be honest here- his wife must be the greatest single living breathing person in the entire WORLD if she was actually able to see through Howard Stern's insulting personality and his many constant aggressive attempts to shock his listeners.  Only the most understanding woman in the world would want to start a family with someone like him. Talk about *extremely* impossible to believe.

I mean come on- Stern completely trashes his wife on the air and yet... she cares about it and feels insulted *sometimes*, but not nearly as often to seem believable from where I'm standing.

I'm sure in reality the arguments that took place between Stern and his wife were much angrier and on the brink of separation than this film makes their relationship appear. It would be pretty darn hard to imagine *anyone* in a relationship not having a problem with their partner going on the air and spouting what most normal people would consider very personal and realistic problems. I simply refuse to believe the fighting incidents you see between them was ANYWHERE near as tame as Private Parts made them seem.

Overall, sure, you'll experience a few worthwhile and solid laughs watching Private Parts, no doubt about it. But watching the film this afternoon, I'm more surprised the most interesting aspect of it was Howard Stern's coming into the world of radio, and MUCH less interesting to me was the actual shock value of his dirty attempts to draw in listeners (which felt disappointingly tame because, again, we've seen worse these days).",1282176000,2,3560,4.7817589576547235

897656,4,6304494378,"There is no debate, Howard Stern has dominated the radio market in the last ten plus years. This film shows how he got to that spot, taking us through the process by which he discovered what people really wanted to hear, and the challenges he faced along the way. You really do not need to be a fan of Stern to appreciate this funny and informative movie. And let's get real; when Stern was on free radio, a lot of those that hated him listened to him even more than those that liked him. As they put it in the movie, haters also wanted to know what he was going to say next!

I was really surprised to see how good a job Howard did with his acting, and Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, who  also play their real personas in the film, did not lag behind at all. This trio delivers laughs-a-plenty, and shows why so many people love them. The bit in which they use the fill-in the blank competition is priceless, and will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Especially when you see Kenny (pig vomit), the program director at NBC, go berserk over what he was hearing on air. I have to stop here and comment on how Giamatti, who played the role of ""pig vomit"", shows his great skills for acting, and you can see that he had those skills way before his success with ""Sideways"".

The film portrays Stern's wife, Allison, as his muse and object of desire. Everything he does is for her. Too bad they got divorced following this production, but this does not spoil any of the fun. If you are looking to have a good time, with some politically incorrect and over-the-top humor, and do not mind a little nudity, you have a winner in this one.",1202083200,,1635,4.3019480519480515
897804,2,6304494378,"Howard Stern ""was"" radio in the 80's and 90's and disputably desevred his self-given title of King of All Media. Sterns humor style (deadpan and cynical delivery) and his excellent writing staff/supporting cast made his show truly a phenomanom in it's heyday. Personally, I loved the show for more than a decade hearing him first locally in Washington,D.C then in syndication from New York. Stern truly did introduce a lot of great humor to the airwaves and transitioned from record-spinner/joketeller to unique humorist. That said, I've come to realize that it's perfectly possible to like the ""Howard Stern Show"" and NOT like Howard Stern.

The events since this film was released has dated this autobiography. The film is a semi-love story about Howards committment to now ex-wife Alison regardless of his irreverent on-air life of fart jokes and lesbian stripper guests. The film also celebrates Stern's battles against censorship, a fight he surrendered from when he moved to satellite radio, all the while hyping his ""little guy against big censorship"" rap that is obviously flat now that listeners must pay and Stern himself never spent a day in court fighting for his rights as a broadcaster. Lenny Bruce was a bloated dope fiend in the end, but he had the balls to fight censorship while Stern has only played the ""role"" of a free speech warrior.

Without these faults, ""Private Parts"" still won't satisfy many hardcore fans because of the sweet natured romantic tone between Howard and Alison as well as the diluted nature of the shows humor. Maybe this film was intended as a crossover to audiences unfamilar with Stern. True fans will be much happier with bootlegs of ""Butt Bongo Fiesta"" or the New Years Special that Stern put out.

897901,4,6304494378,"This film is not for everyone.  As much as it does, at times, candy-coat the raunchy nature of Howard Stern's radio show, PRIVATE PARTS will never convert adamant Howard-haters.

Still if you sit back and enjoy the story, this is a fun movie about the rise of a famous (and to some infamous) radio personality who invented a genre of talk show that's been copied relentlessly over the last 20 years.

Directed by ""Hill Street Blues"" actress Betty Thomas and loosely based on a best selling book by the same title, PRIVATE PARTS stars all the characters Howard made famous since the early 80s on DC and New York City radio shows.

As a result, this cast is mostly comprised of non-actors playing themselves, at various stages of their lives so you have to ""suspend belief,"" as Howard himself urges viewers at the beginning of this film.  (A 40 year old Howard Stern doesn't look like the geeky teenager he once was, though trust me he still looks geeky).

Since every Howard fan has already seen this film many times over, I would recommend PRIVATE PARTS to open-minded people who are unfamiliar with him but up for a great tale about the life (complete with its struggles and successes) of one of the most controversial characters of the late 20th century.

Because I love his actual radio show, but found his old TV show, lacking dimensions of Howard that do not involve sex workers, I appreciated director Betty Thomas's approach to telling the Howard story.  Rather than exclusively focusing on lesbians and pornography, Thomas also reveals the conflicting nature of Howard Stern, complete with an overbearing, critical father, an off-kilter mother and Howard's disturbingly normal and loving relationship with his wife.

What I loved best about PRIVATE PARTS were the scenes that depicted random people hearing Howard Stern's radio and literally looking shocked by what they were hearing.  I remember the first time I heard Howard during the summer of 1985 when he was still on WNBC.  What I heard that afternoon startled me and that is precisely what has kept me tuning in ever since.

It's not that I agree with Howard (though more often than not I do) it is just that I never hear people say the things that come out of his mouth.  And that in a nutshell is precisely what makes Howard great.  Rather than a foul-mouthed shockmeister, Howard is really the voice of a silenced group of people most of us interact with every day.  It is not the voice of left-leaning Hollywood with its politically correct poster children.

Instead Howard is the vocal mouthpiece of the random Joe, who secretly thinks about sex 24 hours a day while straddling the fence between liberal and conservative opinions. Because ultimately he is obsessively concerned with himself, his weight, his body functions and the world around him as it relates to him, Stern offers a stream of conscious window into the inner minds of those complicated middle Americans who voted for Bush, made Bay Watch must-see TV and who to this day continue to baffle exit-pollers.

And his radio crew also appears as themselves, as including his newsroom/side kick Robin Quivers. Howard Stern spent his entire childhood hearing from his father (Richard Portnow) that he is a moron, and one day out of the whole year he would go to work with his father who worked as an engineer in a radio station, which leads him to the decision of working on the radio, and even perfoms his own puppet shows. But he didn't begin his radio carrer until his senior year in college. In high school, he was the only white kid, in a school attended by the blacks, and only went on his first date in college, mostly because girls would turn him down on dates. And then he mets the girl that becomes his future wife, and her name is Alison (Mary McCormack). In 1981, he was hired by a radio station, where he was paired for the first time by newswoman Robin Quivers, that would become his long time newswoman and sidekick, and even when she gets fired from her job, Howard vows her that he will and she of course feels that she was breyed. He gets a new newsman, and he does whatever he can until the new guy gets tired and says he doesn't want to work with him anymore, along with servel other people, and so Robin Qiuvers is re-hired for the job. And then WNBC ratiung drop, the mange to lure him over to the station, and Kenny ""Pig Vomit"" (Paul Giamatti) is the progrtam director over there, and he voulneers to try to tame Howard.

The movie has a good feeling to it and it has some very funny moments, but there's not much to it beyond the story we'd already known about Howard - as revealed over the years on his radio show.

This movie was on TV last night, and though it was heavily edited, it was just what I needed to watch.

The story that is told here is one about doing what you feel is necessary, no matter who, or what force tries to cut you down. The movie is important for this reason. Sometimes we forget we are right, when EVERYBODY tells us we are wrong! The message is to keep fighting for what you believe in. If the results of your struggle are hillarious, well then thats an added bonus.

Theres more happening for this movie than just STERNs potty humor, so don't let the leading role deter you. Although there is a bit (heh heh) for good measure. (Lots of boobs)

The supporting roles are all great, Mary Mcormack as his wife, Robin Quivers, and Fred Norris as themselves (and Jackie The Joke Man, who is GREAT for the five minutes he's in the movie). Then Paul Giamatti, who plays Pig Vomit. He's a great comic actor, but you have to hate him in this one, his character anyway. Without that animosity towards him, this movie would never have worked as good as it did. ""W-eeeeN-Bee-Ceee""

So, enough said, heres the basic gist of this thing. Howard Stern grows up an awkward kid, eventually he breaks into radio but struggles for a while, until he gets big on a D.C radio station, and then gets picked up by the big boys at NBC. Here is where the major conflicts arise between Stern and Pig Vomit. Pig Vomit wants to make him sorry he ever took the job at NBC, and really wants him to quit (The station can't fire him because of breach to the contract.) The war begins and ends, I won't tell you how. You can probably guess. AC/DC joins him on stage at the end and ROCKS Central Park! Thats just the icing on the cake right there.

This movie will make you laugh even if you don't like Howard. It will probably soften you up to him if you are a straight out hater. I personally always found him funny at times, and at times sort of dumb... but the movie is pretty rad.",1137628800,,2140,4.300248138957817

His special kind of humor is almost getting the nerves of WNBC president Kenny ""Pigvomit"" Rushton ( Paul Giamatti) then becomes a media legend.

Entertaining and humorous biography comedy drama that follows Howard Stern's autobiography very well! the acting is very good even Howard maybe a little stiff at times, there is some cameos by Ozzie Osburne, AC/DC, Mia Farrow, and more.

897908,4,6304494378,"Howard Stern is the world's most famous radio DJ. He's obnoxious, sleazy, perverted, silly, and overrated. However, his 1997 semi-biographical film Private Parts, adapted from the book with the same title, is outrageously funny.

The movie gives us a closer look at Howard's college years, his beginnings on live radio, and rise to fame. But the movie focuses more on his romantic life with his wife-to-be Allison, played by Mary McCormack, his hysterical confrontations with WNBC's executive, the one Howard calls Pig Vomit, played by the even more hysterical Paul Giamatti, and his collaboration with long time partners Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, played by themselves.

I personally do not approve of or like Howard's show, but this movie cracked me up laughing when I first saw it, and still does today.

OK fine, I've been listening to Howard since he was on WNBC in the afternoon in the early 80s so it is hard to see a watered down sensitive Howard acting on screen. All in all I can't bash this though. What I want to know is where is Crucified By The FCC, US Open Sores, and Butt Bongo Fiesta? They should release those on DVD. They were hilarious. I'll tell you, for all the flack Howard is getting now he used to be much dirtier (and funnier, I think). Anyone remember his old channel 9 show? I wish I had taped those, if I only had known.

Recently I bought a SONY BRAVIA 32 INCH display and I have a collection of over 600 Dvds. I learned now about ""Enhanced for 16x9 TVs"" and how important it is, I did not care about it or even know about it since I own a standard TV, however all my Dvds are Region 1 and in widescreen, I never buy fullscreen Dvds. So I did an inventory on my collection and realized the following:

Out of 600+ Dvds, 42 are NOT enhanced for 16x9 TVs and they really look horrible when I played them on my PC. Anyway, according to my inventory.

897985,5,6304494378,"In America,there is one radio disc jockey that some people think is hillarious,and there is one radio disc jockey who remains controversial to several people. Who is both of those people? Why,of course,BOTH of those honors go to Howard Stern. I'll admit it,I think Stern is hillarious,and he is my favorite radio disc jockey. Stern's humor may affend some people,and maybe sometimes it does go a little overboard,but jokes like Fartman and some of his jokes that he tends to make on his radio show(and usually gets in trouble for)are plain and flat out hillarious. If You're offended by Howard Stern and you're thinking about giving him a try,then listen to his show first or read one of his books before you come anywhere close to this movie. But if You're not offended by Howard Stern and you happen to be a huge fan of his,then read on for my review of this and then make the decision to whether or not you want to buy/rent this movie:

This movie takes a look at Howard Stern's whole life from his childhood to up about 1994-1996. It is pretty funny. It opens up with showing what happened when Stern did his hillarious ""Fartman"" act on national TV,and throughout the rest of this movie,you get to see what his childhood and his high school years were like and what motivated him to go to college(Boston University)and became a radio DJ,and this movie also covers his personal life outside of his radio show,which is another reason for why this film is so interesting. But of course,this film also covers the shocking things Howard Stern did back then and probably still does today not only in his life,but also on his radio show,and those scenes are 100 percent hillarious with not one exception,no matter how shocking they are. I really enjoyed the scene where Stern and that one lady(this really did happen on Stern's show once)had sex over the radio,and it was also cool to see AC/DC make a guest apperance towards the end of this film.

This movie is something that is definitely worth checking out,if You're a fan of either Howard Stern,radio,or,of course,fun and juvenile humor. I hear that Stern is not going to be doing any more work for Infinity Broadcasting as of January 1,2006 and will be doing his show in an apartment in New York(Manhattan)so I'll definitely have to keep listening to his show when he is doing it over Satellite Radio-it will really suck that all of Stern's fans who still want to listen to him are going to have to pay money just to hear Stern's show off of a Satellite,but it will be interesting to see what Stern's show is like then and if it degrades or is more funny than his radio broadcasts that he is currently doing for Infinity.

Time and money well,well,well,well,well,well,well,well,well spent-I have this movie on VHS,but I'm definitely going to have to get it on DVD.

This movie is an autobiography which follows Stern from childhood to radio God.  I've been listening to the show daily for over 5 years now and only watched this film a few months ago. It is a amazing to see how much the shows content and the personalities have changed over that period. Stern ain't married to Allison anymore. Stuttering john has gone to do his thing with Leno. Robin has gained a little weight. Howard's lost some. Pig Virus has gone, but dead air dave and Tom Chiusano is still making Howards life a misery.

898083,3,6304494378,"When this came out, it got a lot of press because it was so much better than people expected. As a biopic, it is somewhere in between a truly inspirational movie and absolute schmaltz. It has a feeling similar to The People vs.  Larry Flynt, and is of a similar quality. As a comedy, it was intermittently funny, although not terribly imaginative. The fun is in learning more about Stern's perspective on his own life, and in seeing his crew play themselves (initially, younger versions of themselves). The element of self-deprecation is kind of original, and makes for some of the movie's best moments, but pseudo-sexy scenes, such as when Stern gives a woman an orgasm by having her sit on a speaker while he makes a raspberry, are played for far more value than they're worth. Also, Stern's initial boss is presented as too much of a stereotype, with too stereotypical comeuppances. Still, this is well worth seeing for anyone who is a Stern fan, and Stern detractors/neutralists will probably get a new perspective.",1104796800,,1019,4.822857142857143
898084,4,6304494378,"This is the story of a loser shock jock, picking on a bunch of regular DJ's that didn't have the gual to fight back.  And when he kicked them when they were down, they completely submitted to Howard.  Howards rise to fame is wonderfuly depicted in this stunning movie of a man with no backbone.  Had Mel Karmizen not been there like Micky in Rocky III carrying the ""King"" to all these easy wins over has beens, Howard would be Side by side with Wobble Dobbley Doo on LIVE365 internet radio.  The true farce of this movie is that this famous DJ is only concerned for Alison, the girl of his dreams.  And in reality, she left him because his husband and father qualities equal those of Scott Peterson, which is why his daughter is banging anything that moves at radio station parties in NYC.

If Opie and Anthony had been around druing this mistake of a file, they would have been omitted from it anyway.  Howard is scared of them and their XM channel 202 High Voltage radio show that only costs a mere $.07 a day for shocking comedy and Lil Jimmy (eatabullet.com).  Howard had been afraid of them since they began taking his crown away in the 90's.

By saying anything that came to his mind without concern for control or civility, Howard made a name for himself..and now he is a mult-millionaire drenching himself in material comforts.

This movie does have some very funny scenes which people in radio recognize as extremely comical.  From encounters with fickle station management to botched gigs and fragile egos, the movie is alive with interesting personalities, or as my mother would say, ""characters.""",1092960000,,573,5.217391304347826
898088,3,6304494378,"Even though the film came out in '97, he's no longer on FM radio, or married to his wife. However, this is still a funny film in its own right, and gave him a little more dimension to his radio personality and why he was so outrageous to begin with.

Based on his book, the movie covers some ground in his childhood, with a father constantly yelling at him and a (s)mother, that it starts going into Woody Allen territory, but the seeds are planted that he wants to be on the radio as a personality.

I think that with Second City actress turned director Betty Thomas and Ivan Reitman producing, they took a potentially one dimensional crassfest into a real story, starring someone who had no acting experience that did a great job in seeming natural at it.

Robin and Fred have significant roles in the film, the point is that the show was not just him, but the group assembled, without which he never would have succeeded the way he did.

In true Stern fashion, the film has no shortage of naked women, featured in between scenes being interviewed by his producer Gary.

Another reason to watch this is for the people who broke out of this film and have since become well known in their own right:

There are 2 future ""West Wing"" actors on here. One is Mary McCormack, who plays Howard's wife Allison, who supports him through thick and thin, although the marriage fell apart early on  in the marriage, and made comedy out of a personal tragedy. Allison Janney plays a radio producer that gets under Robin's skin.

The biggest reason to watch this is for Paul Giamatti's breakout performance as Howard's nemesis. Even if you're not a Howard Stern fan, Giamatti is the biggest reason to watch this over the top performance that even ""Sideways"" didn't capture.

Longtime character actors Richard Shull and Richard Portnow have great scenes, the former as Symphony Sid and the latter as Howard's father, and ""Tilt"" actor Michael Murphy as Roger Erlick.
There are a lot of veteran character actors in this film (as well as well known adult film stars like Jenna Jameson.... The MTV awards shows have a bunch of cameos (Tiny Tim at the awards?), and a brief clip of ""Soprano"" Edie Falco as one of Alison's friends driving in the car. AC/DC is also in the film towards the end. And of course the ""Wack pack"" put in an appearance as well.

However, Howard is the central character through it all, and brings forth a warmth that isn't shown so much on the radio show, which can be very mean, that he was just a misfit that never fit in whether he was unknown or the king of all media. I think that this film converted more women to his audience because of his relationship to Alison in it.

The shortcoming of the film is that for the longtime fans, they would expect something far less mainstream. It stops in the mid 80s, where ""Miss America"" would pick up the man in his prime.

The DVD itself is barebones, but the price is good. It screams for a special edition due to his following and the film itself having been up for AFI's all time comedies (it barely missed the top 100). It had a platinum selling soundtrack with a killer collection of songs (which had originally slated Tool to cover Led Zeppelin's ""No Quarter"" and VH with David Lee Roth's ""Can't Get This Stuff No More""). THe actors have since gone on to bigger things since, and chances are that he'll never make another movie. There has been a TV version and had mentioned a lot of outtakes, behind the scenes footage as well as the MTV premiere featuring Rob Zombie and Janes Addiction. A commentary with the actors, or just Stern and his crew would have been great to have been able to include on here, especially since he had made the movie AT THE SAME TIME he was doing his morning radio show.

The plot is really quite simple: It's about a guy who was interested in radio from a young age (whose father worked at a radio station), was a complete geek with low self-esteem (thanks to a father who constantly berated him and a mother who was over-protective), who worked his way up in radio - working at one radio station where they went country overnight (seeing Howard in a cowboy hat and jeans, looking out the window and getting on the microphone to say this wasn't his thing in a slight Southern twang almost made me wet myself, I was laughing so hard), another station where the General Manager wanted him to fire a guy with a family and where he vomited that night because he felt so bad about it, went to D.C. radio for a few years and wound up in New York after being fired from the D.C. gig and hit the big time (you think they kick themselves from time to time in D.C. thinking of the dough they could have gotten from syndication?).
Howard, Robin, and the gang did a great job in playing themselves but I really felt like I was there when the censors attempted to stifle Howard's creativity - from college radio to DC.  Seeing Howard's recreation of his defiance of the censors was inspiring.
Yes, believe it or not, Howard CAN act and this is a must see movie to know the essentials on the King of All Media.

He married a woman who was way too good for him (something she apparently finally realized)and dragged her through the mud till she got sick of it and dumped his sorry carcass.  He persists to this day saying purile clap trap that only appeals to children in adult bodies, not to adults.  The most laughable part of this whole sorry tragedy is the praise he receives for ""having the courage to speak his mind.""

Of course it's all about how much Howard thinks he's misunderstood, it's more of a hagiography than anything else, it's based on a book by him, about him, and played by him.

The movie comedy, ""Private Parts"" is a hilarious portrayal of Stern's life and his rise to fame & success in the radio business. But it is also something else. Who would have thought, that the so called 'shocking', ""King of All Media"" would create for his first theatrical film ...a good old fashion love story? Thats right, instead of going the easy route of bimbos and bodily functions (O.K., there in the movie too!) he presents, what is essentially a love letter to his (now ex) wife, Alison. This autobiography gets everything right, from his geeky, introverted childhood (""Seinfeld's"" George Costanza's parents have nothing on Howard's mother & father!) to his early days as a really bad Disc Jockey to his rise to fame as the #1 radio personality in the #1 radio market, New York City. Eventually Stern would reach national prominance in radio syndication. All along this journey the movie features all the ups and downs of Howard's marrige & relationship to Alison (well played by actress Mary McCormack). Director, Betty Thomas does a credible job at presenting us with an entertaining and very funny movie. The cast does quite well. It might not be big stretch to play himself, but Howard Stern proves he can actually act and his brand of humor can make the leap from radio to film. Kudos also for the rest of the Stern show regulers Robin Quivers, Jackie ""the Jokeman"" Martling and the always stone faced, Fred Norris. But the real scene stealer of the film is comic actor, Paul Giamatti. Giamatti plays the thankless but gut busting funny role of Howard's WNBC boss, who was nicknamed ""Pig Vomit"" on the radio show. With eyes and veins bulging the character tries to reign in and censor Stern and his often scatological program. Giamatti is just truely hilarious as he practically has a nervous breakdown, while Stern harangues him, live on the air! A classic comic moment that has to be seen to be believed! If you are a Howard Stern fan or just a fan of really good comedy, I would highly recommend this very funny film",1073865600,3,2408,4.708530805687204

898171,5,6304494378,"Last week, I was languishing in the confining comfort of my small apartment, idly perusing the contents of old videotapes in a mostly-futile attempt to assuage the holiday blues.  Christmas is, after all, a time to spend with those you love....and if you're a 45-year-old, premenopausal, recovering manic depressive spinster with a longstanding resignation to your own pain, then a celluloid tonic is usually a welcome panacea.
At length, I saw that I had taped 1997's ""Private Parts"" during its inaugural television broadcast.  Happily, the film featured clips of The King of All Media interrupting the proceedings, interjecting the teleplay with his own sardonic sermons.  As I laughed timidly (OK, OK, I laughed exuberantly...get off my back) at Howard's infamous inflections and enjoyed the film for the first time since 1997, I remembered these salient points: In 1994, I believed with firm conviction that Howard Stern was the devil incarnate.  An uncaring, insensitive lout who wouldn't know good taste if it bit him in the generals.
By March 1996, I regarded him as a comedic genius.
""Private Parts"" depicts the radio magnate in all his irreverent, groundbreaking and glorious humanity.  His romance and subsequent marriage to Alison (whom he has since divorced and who is now remarried), is sweetly presented here.  Yes, the shock jock is frequently maddening, and some of his material contains questionable taste.  (All right, I'll come out and say it - some of his stuff is downright gross.  ""Butt Bongo Fiesta"" has about as much appeal for this hetero as a Sapphic Satyricon has for Anita Bryant.)
But ""Private Parts"" doesn't represent the nadir of Stern's career.  Rather, it reveals layers of sensitivity and kindness beneath the rough-hewn exterior.  In some ways, Stern is Everyman - a testament to his massive success.  Although by now fabulously wealthy, Stern has many of the same problems that millions of others share:  marital issues, childrearing dilemmas, anal-retentive bosses, etc. - and ""Private Parts"" presents the endearing vulnerability at his core.  (His scenes with Robin Quivers present this skillfully.)
In a nutshell, this film is a fitting explanation for why I came to love Howard Stern.  And that's probably why my depression lifted last week upon viewing this film.
I don't watch Howard's E! shows much any longer.  Most of them now concern strippers, sophomoric stunts and assorted juvenilia that I have no interest in watching.  However........
In 1999, soon after separating from Alison, Stern devoted a portion of his morning radio show to ""Sheera, Princess of Power.""  Sheera had recently died, and, true to form, the softhearted Stern had taken her in when she was an abandoned kitten.  A lifelong feline-o-maniac, I found myself riveted to Stern's monologue, not even realizing I was weeping my eyes out.  Soon enough, my Great King interjected some brutal humor into the proceedings, describing how he ""spilled Sheera's ashes all over the carpet.""  Now I began laughing uproariously through my tears.
That, to be sure, is the man I love.",1073001600,,3084,5.167002012072435
898172,4,6304494378,"Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" does an excellent job examining Stern's life from his youth to his radio days.  The movie humanizes Stern by showing that although he is known for his rebellious antics on the radio, he actually has concerns for people who are in his life, including his former wife, who he met when he was young.  The movie does present some scenes that give a superficial impression of how controversial Stern is.  Scenes such as him asking a caller to make sex-sounds on the air, for instance, are prevalent in the movie; however, the movie is in fairly good taste.
On the acting: the acting is actually quite well-done, and I suspect the main reason is because he's playing himself.  But many other actors would have a difficult time playing themselves, including quite embarassing roles regarding their past.  (In Howard's case, his hair in the 1970s was probably a huge embarassment).  Yet there was this feeling that one was visiting him throughout his life . . . that this was real and not actually a movie about the man.
So what happens?  The most important part of the movie relates to Howard's close associates--such as Robin.  Howard Stern meets Robin when she works as a newscaster on the air, present objective information.  He starts to ask her questions about her personal life, which was quite uncommon in the old days, and later, chooses to hire her as another on-air personality.  We see from this movie that Howard was also willing to confront traditional rules and regulations regarding the airwaves and see how far it could go.  Stations that cover his radio show have been fined millions of dollars for his experimentation.  Yet Howard continues to this day.  And we can see from recent developments that Mr. Stern has had a huge impact on our culture.
The FCC, for instance, recently ruled that one may use the F-word on the radio and television, as long as the comment is not related to the description of the act in which the word describes. Ironic but interesting.

898173,3,6304494378,"Yes, this watered-down pseudo-autobiography has some genuinely funny moments, but for the most part PRIVATE PARTS fails to deliver the same raunchy ""shock"" available daily by listening to Howard Stern's syndicated radio show or by watching his cable telecasts.  If I--your humble reviewer--wish to get Mrs. Mikels upset in a New York minute all I need do is tune in to a Stern TV broadcast, then watch this normally tolerant woman start foaming at the mouth.
Yep, couch time again.
Unfortunately, Stern's outrageous, misogynistic persona is neutered in this film--no doubt to appeal to a mainstream audience.  But by softening Stern the character becomes a superficial parody; a ""kinder, gentler"" Howard is unappealing to both his fans and his dissenters.  Granted, the movie depicts some of Stern's famous (infamous?) radio spoofs, but only as a device to show Howard as a disc jockey trying to break free from the bondage of management nimrods rather than the broadcaster's true psychological inclination.
Kind of takes all the fun out of the man, if you ask me.
On the positive side (and the film, as I've said, does have its moments), Stern is surprisingly comfortable and believable in front of a camera, and his unwavering loyalty to fellow broadcaster Robin Quivers is fascinating.  But if you're looking for a real dose of Howard Stern I suggest you bypass PRIVATE PARTS and tune in to his cable show.  That is, if your wife will let you.

It's obvious they're trying to cover up the truth, her incredible stupidity and lack of talent.
Howard bows to her in the film and she's the only one who's 'allowed' to tell Howard to eff himself. If you ask me, she's a spoilt brat who has her backside kissed on the show (one of Howard's rules), and, inevitably, it clearly shows in this film.
C'mon guys. Just because she was raped by dad, doesn't mean she has to be praised a la Kim Jong-Il. I've known girls who were raped by Dad but they don't go shouting about it. Enough already...",1063843200,3,897,4.345238095238095

This movie showed plenty of it, but not all of it.  It basically summarizes his childhood and early years and shows us some of his influences to become a radio personality.  Most of the movie is a flashback panning his lifetime as he moves from small town disc-jockey to well-known local personality to huge radio star.  He meets many of his sidekicks and good friends throughout the movie, such as Robin Quivers, Fred Norris, and Jackie Martling.  Unfortunately, the flashback cuts off in the mid-80's and doesn't touch at the next ten years of his career.  Either way, the movie was able to make us feel sorry and compassionate for who much of society calls the Antichrist.  It has its funny moments and some sad moments, but in the end it's a decent comedy.  Private Parts has some gross-out humor and a fair share of nudity.  I would definitely not like this movie as much if I weren't a Stern fan, but I am, so I love it.

Through Betty Thomas' direction we don't see the crude and obnoxious shock jock that people love to hate, but we see the flawed human underneath the crude exterior.

This film hardly shows us  Howards  funny but, true childhood expereinces such as when his mother made him wear her underwear to school because all of his were dirty.  We didn't see him get  beat up by blacks when living in a predominantly black community. We didn't see his comical sexual experiences during his adolescent years as he described in this book. The list goes on and those were the funniest parts of the Book yet, this movie didn't take advantage of it.
It appeared Ivan Riteman (whatever way his name is spelled) chose to only focus on Howards career & marriage and put a lighthearted spin on it. Yeah, I know Howard eggxagerates his personality on the radio but, the book had more of a politically incorrect NC-17 tone to it. This Movie however, fails to capture that but, instead makes Howard  into a  likeable goodhearted person. That was obviously Paramount's strategy to make this film appeal to a broad mainstream audience however, That clearly backfired since it only earned 42 Million and most of that revenue came from loyal Howard Stern Fans.  I think this movie could have been the funniest movie ever made if the director used Howards book as a blueprint, however it ends up being a tame watered down version of what it should have been.",1042675200,21,1455,4.616279069767442

898276,4,6304494378,"If you think Stern delivers a 1.5 hour Ode to Flatulence you're wrong. Here we have an original comedy, presented in no off-hand manner: reportedly HS spent years researching scripts. We get a full, believable movie, not only because of the star's belief in the project but because the whole production looks and sounds right. His early years in radio are intriquing, as he searches for his own radio and personal(?) identity amidst poverty line production values. I say ""radio identity"" because there is no doubt that although he is called ""The King Of All Media"", he was made for radio - a great voice, a style of predictable unpredictability. Like, ofcourse he's going to say something wild, but *how wild this time*?
The personal story is well directed and well acted, although some Sternologists might feel that Mary McCormack's Allison is too much a stretch: the real Mrs. Stern is a successful Psychologist *and* the heart of Howard's life without the ""feminist"" underpinning. McCormack's performance is excellent however - particularly in the ""making a baby"" scene. Her matter-of-fact statement that she's ""ready"" is brilliantly expressed - a poignant meeting of the practical and the romantic.
Robin Quivers does a fine job of acting although she does not emote as she could have in the scene where she meets her future teammate. Stern immediately shatters all concerns of propriety as they converse on the air and Quivers has very little reaction. A person trying to build a career in radio around 1981 would have had dilated pupils at least when the thought that her career might be over any second because of some newcomer's attempt to turn the industry upside down and use her as an instrument. At the time, talking to a Newsperson on the air was not encouraged, especially talking about ""private"" area stuff. Whether it's faulty direction or not here is a question.
An entertaining performance is delivered by Allison Janney as Dee Dee, the (apparent) Assistant Manager or Program Director in Washington, D.C. Her acting is nuanced, with her mid-30ish character displaying great opprobrium when confronted with the iconoclast on the professional level, while suppressing a certain interest in his ideas on another.
I wish that more time could have been spent on his political viewpoints because by the end of the picture we get the uncomfortable feeling that our anti-hero is portrayed more as just another show business exponent with another bag of gimmicks than a real original.

898278,3,6304494378,"Before 'Private Parts', Howard Stern was a virtual unknown round these parts, at best a shady creature of rumour.  Whereas for an American audience, presumably familiar with the dj's shock-shtick, the film has a nostalgic impulse, offering a quaint re-run of censorship- and taste-baiting episodes; this material was new to us - the shock-jock phenomenon has had very little impact in a Europe long inured to shock.  So some of the material was predictable and juvenile; the on-air naked masseuse or the proxy orgasm; some of it was simply funny, such as the 'fill-in-the-blanks' word-game after rude words are banned by WNBC management; but some of it was genuinely unsettling, in particular Stern's personal jokes on radio in reaction to his wife's miscarriage.  It shows the unexpected extent to which Stern has made you care for his characters in spite of yourself, that your laughs at this point are uncomfortable at best.
Stern is ostensibly telling his life-story to a pretty woman on an airplane.  Originally repulsed by his reputation as a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, foul-mouthed jock, she admits, in his words, that he grows on you, like fungus, and this is the effect his film has.  In a weird way, Stern is a kind of soft-rock Woody Allen, adapting the intellectual loser/little man, New York Jewish persona in a pseudo-autobiographical tale that has him walking through the important episodes of his life.  There is even a (parodic) allusion to Ingmar Bergman (an obscene puppet show staged for an old folks' home), and a cameo by Mia Farrow.  Stern is a film-maker manque, who made an award-winning short at college.
While Allen's self-absorption tends towards negation and psychic self-flagellation, Stern's is whitewashing and self-congratulatory - but the intense egotism has the same effect: you initially resist, you eventually succumb.  Stern becomes engaging, not because you buy the self-pity of the sickly happy-families routine or the 'it's only an act' justifications, but because his limited acting talent fits in ingratiatingly with the vignette-structure, which bypasses psychological realism to achieve a cartoon honesty.  His spat with WNBC won't tell you anything about the state of the American media, or the corporate suppression of free speech, but it does tell you  a lot about Stern, consistently anxious about being 'a real man', and his need to find a ridiculous straw target he can knock down and emasculate to feel good.  Significantly, the film finishes in 1985, with Stern at his peak, and nowhere else to go.  It would have been more interesting to see how he dealt with THAT pressure, than the old loser-rises-to-the-top story.  The film IS misogynistic, not at the obvious, demeaning level, but in the way women simply exist to make Stern whole, whether it is his anchorwoman or his angelic wife.  They have no lives or reasons to be outside his needs.",1016582400,3,2904,5.112050739957716

It is basically the story of Stern's life and career, told very much from his point of view and featuring Stern himself in the lead role. Stern makes a good job of this and is a genuinely endearing character. He retains the audience's sympathy even when he is seen to treat his wife badly, but especially when he faces the crass radio bosses who don't understand his humour.
