8165087,1,B000LXGVQS,"This is not a review about the film (unfortunately I was unable to watch it) but about the hardware defect.
Three times I purchased this title from two different sellers and all three times I received a defective disc from EROS entertainment. The discs were new and all had interupted sound and no picture throughout the whole film. No skipping forward, reinserting or playback in three different players helped. So if you would like to save yourself a hazzle - don't buy.",1335830400,,472,4.7682926829268295
8165088,3,B000LXGVQS,"This is about 2 young people (Akshaye Khanna & Urmila Matondkar) who are strong-willed and well-matched. After a bit of competitiveness and sizing each other up they fall in love. The girls father backs the engagement then publicly refuses to honor it without giving reasons. Old secrets are revealed and some violence past and present takes place. Will the lovers succeed (in what becomes a sort of Romeo and Juliet dilemma)...?
The story is typical Bollywood and fine but the reason I'd put it just a little above average is the acting. Akshaye and Urmila have a lot of acting range and good chemistry and are good to watch. The seniors are also strong- particularly Kader Khan and Paresh Rawal. I don't find the songs of that era (1998) that memorable but they were bright enough and danced well. It's getting a little old but the film quality is fine enough and the fashions aren't too dated yet.
Now if you don't like Bollywood melodrama this isn't for you anyway. I see elsewhere on the Net it gets mixed reviews. On the day I looked on IMDb the voting averaged 3.2 out of 10 but 20% had it a 10 and 20% at a 1! It seemed women liked it more too, and males not much (Akshaye was looking good as the romantic hero though and the focus was on love - though the usually unbelievable fight scenes were there that men seem to go for). I'd probably give it a 3 1/2.",1243900800,2,1365,4.399209486166008
