5910465,5,B00EEEHLBO,Very funny! And so great to find clean comedy! We laughed till we cried! We've showed it to friends and family of different ages and they've all enjoyed it!,1387929600,,156,4.413793103448276
5910466,5,B00EEEHLBO,"I give it five stars right off the bat not just because he deserves it but because Jim Breuer is in his prime and brings laughter for all in a literal sense in this very clean and extremely funny stand-up, keep the pause button ready because you won't want to miss a second of this stand-up.",1387411200,,291,4.214285714285714
5910467,5,B00EEEHLBO,"Jim Breuer, now at 45, shares a different take on his life, one an aging heavy metal banger, and parent to three daughters.  Most people know Breuer from Saturday Night Live, where he offered a variety of hilarious skits.  He has always had a great knack for imitations.

Breuer's comedy strength is in his facial expressions, and that gets highlight by his physical body movements.  When you have that, with great comedy, you only enhance your craft.

This is hilarious.  When he tells you about the heavy metal banging music, he can imitate the music with such satire, sound effects and the musical voices  that gives the audience an idea how absurd (to me) that music was.  So, if you appreciated heavy metal, this can bring back some memories.

Some will love his comedy about working at Sears - the Kdafi routine, funny and so original.  But, my favorite part was going to the drive-thru wildlife preserve,  the event was free... for a can a coke.  It is an event, where you have this wildlife experience surrounding your car as you drive through.  To watch him replicate the actions and movements of the animals, is just too funny!

What is surprising, and what I liked,  is that this show was clean!  Rizzo",1379894400,4,1213,4.650943396226415

5910509,5,B00EEEHLBO,"This is one of the funniest all around DVD's I have ever heard.  And I consider myself a stand-up comedy specialist as it has been my hobby for 30 plus years.  I have a huge collection of all kind of comedians.  Also I am very selective about choosing the comedians who really make me laugh.  The skit about ""long live paint"" was my favorite.  It is the last one on the DVD.  Also loved the ""drive through the safari park"".  My 12 year old grandson thought it was hilarious.  The first routine about visiting a rock concert when you are older was funny too.  Great for the entire family.",1406246400,,587,4.3119266055045875

5910513,5,B00EEEHLBO,Best comedy I've heard for a long time. This guy is talented. Happened to see him on Comedy Central and had to send for his dvd's. Jim Breuer is what many have been waiting for----a guy that can deliver very funny comedy and does not have to submit to the off color junk. A real talent!!,1393545600,,287,4.142857142857143

5910515,5,B00EEEHLBO,"We have seen this special on EPIX at least 5 times since it first premiered, and the part about his wife flying off the handle seems to make my husband laugh harder each time. :)  I crack up about the trip to the safari zoo and his impersonation of Slayer fans.  But like others have said, he is clean, and is just hilarious for all ages.  We've watched with friends, family, and our 6 & 9 yr old (who have all laughed hysterically).

8604701,5,B00EEEHLBO,i've watched this SEVERAL times over the past year!! I was a little apprehensive at first since I didn't care for his acting I've seen in the past but was very pleasantly surprised with his stand-up. His role as a family man now in real life seems to have worked the best for him for sure.,1531008000,,289,4.178571428571429
8604702,5,B00EEEHLBO,"This is hysterical. You don't need to be a Jim Breuer fan or know any of his stand up material or SNL impersonations (which are spot on!!) But you DO need to sit back, relax and LAUGH. I had a kid-free spouse-free evening where nothing on TV was of any interest - and found this on my Prime recommendations list. Bruer's commentary on kids - getting older - the kind of music he listens to  - his relationship with his wife & kids......it all resonated with me.

Found myself laughing out LOUDLY often and was happy to spend an hour of my summer vacation with Jim Breuer. Don't take it too seriously.......",1530576000,,606,4.401785714285714

8604710,1,B00EEEHLBO,"I love comedy, and I rented  because of the glowing reviews the other viewers gave this comedian.  I tried very hard to get past the fact that this grown man REALLY needed a complete make-over. How about a new $20 pair of jeans that don't have paint all over them and frayed cuffs. Then, Some hair gel to calm your spastic, porcupine haircut, and PLEASE for gosh sake, try cucumbers, ice packs, anything, to get rid of the horrible bags under your eyes. It was very hard to look at you. I could not tell if you were on drugs or if you had a congenital defect. I could not finish the disc, and did not laugh.",1523664000,,607,4.17948717948718
