7114084,5,B00VXWK50O,"I've been taking the classes in Los Angeles for months, and I got the dvd to take with me on vacation! It's so much fun to work out and not have to feel the ""work"" part. The dvd is easy to follow, engaging and a great way to burn calories!!! Love it!",1431907200,,250,3.826923076923077
7114085,5,B00VXWK50O,"I absolutely LOVE this workout.  It gives me a great workout and makes me work up a serious sweat, but I'm having a ton of fun while doing so.  I have no background in dance, but find Jason's moves really easy to learn so I can concentrate on getting the most out of my time working out.  According to my heart rate monitor, I'm burning over 700 calories in an hour which is a big part of how I've dropped 20 lbs since finding PlyoJam.  Who knew that getting lean could be so much fun???",1429833600,3,487,4.094736842105263
7114086,5,B00VXWK50O,"I LOVE PLYOJAM!!! This DVD has helped me get into the best shape of my life. It's FUN, EFFECTIVE, and ADDICTING! Trust me when I say this... And also, it has helped me gain so much confidence. Get your SEXY dance cardio and plyometrics ON with this amazing DVD!!!",1429488000,4,263,4.387755102040816
7114087,5,B00VXWK50O,"I love Plyojam work-out!  It's intense and challenging but so much fun at the same time that makes you want for more. It has helped me a great deal with my endurance, my body is toned, and got more energy. I highly recommend it.",1429228800,,228,4.181818181818182
7114088,5,B00VXWK50O,"I Love this DVD! If you like to dance, burn a ton of calories, and have a great time, this DVD is for you! This plyometric type of Dance has transformed my body, leaving me toned and stronger. I hope there will be more DVDs in the future!",1429056000,,238,3.9791666666666665
7114089,5,B00VXWK50O,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  It is so fun, sexy, edgy, and made me SWEAT!!  Seriously feel like I burned 1,000 calories.  The burn out sessions are HARD, but got easier as I did them more and more often.  Really love this workout and highly recommend.",1428969600,,251,4.391304347826087
7114090,5,B00VXWK50O,I sweat so much more on this workout compared to the Jillian Michael's workout I am used to. The first time it's a little hard to follow but after a few times you get the hang of it.,1460505600,,182,3.8157894736842106
7114091,5,B00VXWK50O,"If you're like me and have a very busy life with little time to work out, Plyojam is IT.  According to my heart rate monitor, I had 450 calories burned in half an hour, 800 burned in an hour.  800 calories burned in an hour is unheard of for me--it usually takes me 1 1/2 to 2 hours to get anywhere near that number.  On top of the amazing calories burned in such a short period of time, it's also a lot of FUN.

Another reviewer said the instructor doesn't give you enough warning during transitions.  That person is right, but the more you do it the easier it gets.  I actually prefer that he doesn't spell everything out in a paint-by-numers way, because that makes it go by faster for me.  I don't like a lot of talking when I'm working out, and God bless this guy, because he keeps the chatter to a minimum.  I don't know if he could chatter even if he wanted to, because this workout will have your heart in your throat to where you can barely breathe, let alone talk.

Please make more workouts like this one.  I won't hesitate to purchase every single one.  Highly recommended!",1460419200,,1085,4.269607843137255
7114092,5,B00VXWK50O,"Love it! It looks like it's so simple, fun and joyful dancing, you really enjoy, but by the end of the complex you realize that that was a really hard workout. I was all soaked and breathless with deep red face )))) And still it left me with the feeling of light and joy!",1458086400,,271,4.037037037037037
7114093,3,B00VXWK50O,"PROS: First, I like the moves, and they're slightly different than most workout videos (even the dance-y ones) which is fun and challenging. The plyometric options really ramp up the workout. The instructor is great. I love his energy and attitude - the perfect blend of ""push through this"" and ""it's okay, do what you can."" Also, he keeps chatter to a minimum, which is great. Some instructors talk through EVERYTHING, which is fine and often helpful in a live class, but when you're buying a DVD, you really don't want to hear the same cliche' motivator or cheesy joke 3 - 6 times a week.

CONS: The cues aren't great. They're often not there at all. I've been doing home workout videos for 15 years and it's rare that I can't keep up or can't catch onto a move. I can usually keep up even when instructors are totally silent, but do a quick gesture a few beats before a new move, or hold up 3 fingers to indicate going through the sequence 3 times. In Plyojam, he often won't say anything until he's already started the next move. I imagine I'll eventually memorize it, but it's a bit annoying - If you're going to say anything, it should be said a few beats ahead of the change. The cueing wouldn't be such an issue except that there are several times, where a new move is introduced, there's no cue, AND the camera is zoomed onto the upper body so there's NO chance of knowing what they're doing until the camera zooms out again. I ended up going too hard on my knees because my stubbornness to keep up under poor circumstances caused me to transition to quickly with bad form.

A note about the format: The digital version is a disappointment. I paid the same price as a DVD, but it seems like Amazon makes it extra difficult it you're using Google products. I have an Android phone, a Chromebook, and a Chromecast to send videos to the TV and I have ONLY been able to view this on my laptop. As soon as I realized it (about 3 minutes in), I went back to where I had seen the ""return"" option, and it was no longer there. I wish I could exchange for the DVD.",1457222400,3,2063,4.314432989690721
7114094,5,B00VXWK50O,Fun workout with lots of calorie burn!! The instructor is fun to follow!,1440892800,,72,4.615384615384615
7114095,5,B00VXWK50O,"I had a very long wait before I could try out this dance burnout but - it was well worth the wait.  I don't live in the USA and therefore only found out about this workout via a blog which had Jason on being interviewed.  he then proceeded to demonstrate 10 minutes of his normal workout - phew was I sweating at the end of the ten minutes.  however, i was hooked and I've spent since October - when the workout first came out - until now - July - trying to purchase it! Technical difficulties with Jason's site meant I couldn't purchase via this method and they don't ship outside of the UK - but then it was placed on Amazon USA - brilliant.  This is a workout that is really going to make you want to go back for  more.  it is totally new and  different from the usual style of workouts that I have personally encountered.  I love it.  Jason really makes you want to give it your all and his drive and enthusiasm certainly keeps me motivated throughout the complete workout.  It's hard work but rewarding!",1437523200,4,1008,4.257894736842105
7114096,5,B00VXWK50O,"Great, fun workout plus challenging and will keep your heart rate up!",1436745600,,69,4.833333333333333
7114097,5,B00VXWK50O,"I somehow thought Alicia Marie was on this DVD but she's not.

Anyway I've seen Alicia Marie post video clips working out with Jason to plyojam and that's how I discovered this workout. I also went to the website and purchased 2 workouts ( it's on demand so u only get 24 hrs access to one workout for $2).

Being that I tried out the online workouts ( Alicia Marie is on those) before receiving the DVD then I somehow was a bit disappointed with the DVD.( just a LITTLE bit)

Overall the workouts on the DVD were awesome but not as fun as those online not because Alicia Marie was missing but because the songs online are current and I felt like I was dancing along whereas on the DVD it was more dance beats or dancing to nice but unpopular songs.

Jason Layden you are awesome and may I request that you maybe place some of those online workouts on a DVD and sell them. I don't like paying $2 for 24 hr access because in the long run that'll really add up.

I saw the videoclip of you guys dancing to the song cheerleader on Facebook and was hoping the DVD would have content more like that.

I would rate this workout as intermediate in intensity.
For a more fun high intensity version, the place to go is the online on demand videos that I previously mentioned up top.

*********

***********Update 7/21/15************

Since I've last reviewed this product and complained I need a bit more intensity. I purchased a heart rate monitor to tell how many calories I burn during my  workouts.

Turbofire is my all time favorite workout and I usually do the 45 55 or 60 minute length workouts but for comparison I did the turbofire 30 workout and it (tf30)seemed rather easy.
I recorded my calories burned for both this workout vs turbofire 30 workout and after seeing the difference, I bumped up my rating for this workout to a full whopping 5 stars!!!!!( previously I rated it 4 stars)

Here are my results ( I did both workouts full intensity without a break, I am 145lbs, 5 ft 8, female)

Plyojam
Length: 33:15 minutes
Avg HR: 150
max HR 174
Calories burned: 327

Turbofire 30 workout
Length: 31:24
Avg HR: 143
Max HR: 175
Calories burned: 289

Cize crazy 8's
Length: 32:00 minutes
Avg HR: 137
Max HR: 161
Calories: 272

That being said!!!!! Jason your workouts are a lot of fun, I'd never have guessed that I was burning that many calories.
I'm happy to hear you are releasing another DVD this fall. Would love to see a lot more DVDs released in the future also. If possible can we also have a few longer duration workouts too. Love it!!!!",1436227200,2,2544,4.403846153846154
7114098,5,B00VXWK50O,Initially saw him on Popsugar's fitness videos & then scoured on youtube to see more Plyojam.  Just an awesome workout. Burn lots of calories & it's super fun & very engaging!  Love it as a workout alternative from my usual boring (but effective) workout!,1433289600,2,255,4.7727272727272725

8711703,5,B00VXWK50O,"I love this workout!  It's so upbeat and fun to do, it makes me want to exercise!  After not seeing any new videos on amazon I searched online and found that Jason is still doing his workouts but now they update weekly online for a flat yearly fee!  I'm so happy I decided to search google for more because I was just doing this one video over and over!  Now I've found new workouts that are set to fun current songs!  And they go by so fast, you're done before you know it!  This is the one of the few workouts that I enjoy doing and would highly recommend Plyojam!  (And I by no means have any dance or rhythm skills, but I still have fun!)",1524614400,,642,4.0476190476190474

8711705,4,B00VXWK50O,"Not a lot of different things to do on this single DVD.  One 30min work out and three 5 min burst work outs.  Haven't been able to test heart rate or anything and have only done this for a few days .  While some things I start to feel like I may be wasting my time, other things in the video get me working , I'm pretty fit from doing other daily exercises but my legs started to burn and I was pushing hard and breathing hard a little bit also .  Fun though.  Does not go step by step to show you, its straight through and he jumps right into it.  Just follow best u can but figure I'll probably have it memorized in a couple weeks or so like I did with cize",1497830400,,659,3.8444444444444446
8711706,5,B00VXWK50O,"You cannot and will not go wrong adding this workout program to your at home workout rotation.  It is so much fun, unique, challenging, results oriented, fun, fun, fun.  The amount to purchase the workout is worth every Penney.  Seriously, it is worth it and you will not get bored with it quickly.",1483315200,,298,4.584905660377358
8711707,5,B00VXWK50O,"Fun, high energy dance/exercise video.  I exercise 5-6x/week and am in pretty good shape, and I was dripping sweat at the end of the video.  I have such fun dancing that the time goes by fast.  I just wish there were more Plyojam videos available on Amazon.  (Just an aside.  People often tell me they can't get a 'real cardio workout' from a dance class.  Well, when I see them in the dance/exercise class I know why.  You get out of the class what you put in.  So put your heart and your energy into it and you will get a great workout!)",1474588800,,539,4.165048543689321
