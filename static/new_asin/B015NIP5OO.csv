8734077,5,B015NIP5OO,"A refreshingly, original take on survival shows with three truly brilliant guys.  How they overcome challenges and obstacles is really amazing, and the show is also very funny.  The interplay between all three is very funny.  It is good to see Dave Canterbury on a survival show again.  Their friendship is strongly felt in this series.  Even through the challenges, they help each other and always have an encouraging word for the other guy.  Really would have liked to see more episodes.  But these are definitely destined to be classics.",1482019200,,540,4.933333333333334
