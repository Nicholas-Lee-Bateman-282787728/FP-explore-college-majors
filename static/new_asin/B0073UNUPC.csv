8509462,4,B0073UNUPC,I don't have more of Gilad and isolated ab work but I would say this was decent. It did do the job. Ball wasn't that necessary and I did get buy w/ a small hand weight. I would recommend this for someone who needed a place to start w/ their ab work.,1370217600,,249,3.8076923076923075
8509463,5,B0073UNUPC,"This advanced and hard core/abs workout is done on the floor, either supine (on your back) or prone (on your stomach).  There is no standing work.

You already need to have a strong core in order to do some of the exercises, including the many roll ups.  When I had difficulty rolling all the way up, I had to substitute the easier crunches.  There are also many oblique or twisting variations.  Plus, there are many double crunches, working both the upper and lower abs simultaneously.  Basically, this workout is a lot of whatever you can imagine doing on your back for the abdominals and obliques.  It also includes back work, so it works the entire core.

It's not all hard work.  Stretches are spread throughout the workout so you get a chance to recover.

The required equipment is a heavy ball which is equivalent to a 3 to 5 pound dumbbell or a medium-weight medicine ball. I used a medium-weight medicine ball.  You can do some of the exercises without the heavy ball.
