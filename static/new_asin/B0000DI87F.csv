8001048,5,B0000DI87F,"Most familiar with the works of Elie Wiesel will think of his memorable semi-autobiographical novels, his two-volume memoir or his long and unflagging effort to bring the issue of human rights--not only Jewish human rights--before the eyes of the world.  Here, we see a different Wiesel, even different than the man who stood up to Ronald Reagan when he urged him (unsuccessfully) not to visit Bitburg.  it is not so much that his theme--the plight of oppressed Jews-- is unfamiliar.  Rather, it is how it is revealed.  Not only is it a play, and brilliantly cast, but, as some may remember from its appearance many years ago on PBS, it focuses us on post-World War II history, the struggle of Jews in freshly post-Stalinist Russia.  Joseph Wiseman is the old Rabbi of the town who has nearly given up hope of ever seeing his people breathe the brisk air of freedom, and, at the same time, grieving for his spiritually wayward daughter, while he and his neighbors and congregants alike kow-tow to the local officials who gently strong-arm them to behave and shut up.  Richard Bauer, as the synagogue beadle, and crazy like a fox, tries to lift Wiseman out of his spiritual malaise and speak out.  There is great humanity here, and--please--it is not just for a Jewish audience, much like, I would argue, is the case with most of the Wiesel canon.  Watch this and be changed.",1291075200,5,1374,4.7196652719665275
