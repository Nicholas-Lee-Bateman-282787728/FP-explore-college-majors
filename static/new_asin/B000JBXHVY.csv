2667962,4,B000JBXHVY,"I was very happy to finally get Captain N The Game Master on DVD. I was disappointed like other people that made reviews that the 80's songs were removed. To me that made all the scenes Season 1 stand out more for me. I also noticed shaking on the screen during ""Kevin in Videoland"" but again my old VHS tapes are in terrible condition and I was missing a few episodes in Season 2. I think that bonus features should have been better like the other version of ""Hows Bayou"" and more details of the making of Captain N. Again I loved Captain N growing up and am still very happy to get this great cartoon on DVD. Thank you and I hope this will help someone else out.",1172707200,,664,4.155038759689923
2667963,3,B000JBXHVY,"The last review sums everything up very well.  It could be better, but I'm just glad to have this series (most of it) available in decent form.

I have noticed 2 problems while watching:

1) The video shakes in certain scenes. It can actually be pretty distracting.
2) In ""Queen of the Apes"" the playback skips over about ~2 minutes of episode.

#1 isn't that bad, but #2 is unacceptable.  Hopefully this will be addressed in a re-release.",1172620800,3,439,4.576923076923077
2667964,4,B000JBXHVY,"Of all the cartoons I remember from my youth, I honestly never thought that Captain N: The Game Master would ever see the light of day again.  Then again, considering the renaissance that Nintendo is going through thanks to the Wii and DS, maybe it's of little surprise that this old Nintendo cartoon would make it's way to DVD.  Originally airing in the late 80's/early 90's, when Nintendo was king of the console world (then again, they pretty much were the console world at the time), Captain N revolved around a California teenager lured into the interactive world of video games to combat evil.  Alongside him in battle are video game characters including Castlevania's Simon Belmont, Capcom's robot icon Mega Man, and even cult video game icon Kid Icarus.  As the show goes on, nearly every popular series to get it's start on the 8-bit NES is covered on Captain N; ranging from Tetris, Punch-Out (no Mike Tyson), Metroid, and even Zelda and Link (who had their own animated series too), and the series maintains a fun atmosphere throughout with a good amount of kid-aimed action.  Watching Captain N now though suffers the same fate as many cartoons from the era; they haven't aged all too well.  In the later episodes in particular, the animation (which was never really anything to write home about) seems to decline more in quality, and as a previous reviewer has already stated, not every episode in the series is here in this handsome DVD set.  That aside, there's an actual nice assortment of extras for old time fans with fond memories of the series, and it's good to see Captain N make his way to DVD.",1169683200,6,1616,4.709219858156028
2667965,5,B000JBXHVY,"Based on the 6-page short story ""Captain Nintendo"" published in Nintendo Power magazine issues 3 & 4, Captain N: The Game Master debuted September 9, 1989 on NBC, and was immediately embraced by Saturday morning viewers.

2667966,3,B000JBXHVY,I have been waiting for this to come out My tapes are really worn. I know it's nice to have these but the copyrighted songs were taken out like Thriller and other favorites replaced with an annoying instrumental song that plays through every episode. I wish they had a way to take out the music so you won't hear that same song through every episode.another thing I'm tired of is the extras. i don't want to see pics of backgrounds used for the show Like the Super Mario set How about sketches of the characters or even bios would be nice cause looking at backgrounds is boring!,1168214400,5,578,4.411214953271028
2667967,4,B000JBXHVY,"Well to start off my review of the Captain N DVD set, i want you to know i'll be reviewing the set, and not the series. The reason i say this is cause alot of people have been complaining that the fact that its not a complete set as it says on the box. When i heard season 3 isn't part of this set, i was angry as much as you guys are, but thats not Shout's fault, its DiC's fault for the way they archive their catalog of cartoons. I'll be grading the review with 1-10 with 10 being the highest and 1 being the lowest....duh. Well heres my review on the dvd set we have in our hands:

Presentation:

Pros: Well after seeing the menu design and setup for the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers Super Show, i was very impressed on Shout treated the series instead of throwing them out like some companies. Zelda had sorta weekest menu design compared to all the sets that are avaiable right now with Captain N being one of my favorites with the NES design that keeps with the series. The introduction was new to the Video Game sets that DiC and Shout have released in the past couple of years. Can't wait to see how Sonic SatAM, Adventure of Sonic, and Adventure of Super Mario 3 will turn out.

Cons: Honestly i didn't see any flaws with the menu design for exception for one item, the intro when it does the opening of Captain N. You can, obiously, tell the cuts they did and i find it a bit distracting. But thats a very minor con that don't effect anything.

Score: 9

Video:

Pros: Wow, just wow. I never seen such good quality in a decade and a half series. I say it did quite good as far as quality at least for a 1989 series turned out. I do not have a HDTV or any HDTV dvd player so i don't know if it'll look better or not but i love how the turn out was for the series and its exactually how i remember it plus better, since back durning that time i had a 32in tv that we didn't have cable at the time.

Cons: Well there are at least two cons i found while watching the set and one is sorta big as far as preservation but also really didn't effect the story line. There was a ""cut"" that was on the masters itself that made it to the dvds that took out 2 minutes of the episode ""Queen of the Apes"". Now i have the old VCD of Captain N and rewatched that episode and really the cut wasn't a big issue to begin with but i do have to judge the turnout since really i'm disappointed that it didn't get caught and fixed before the release, if there is some kinda disc replacement, i'm all for it but really its not a big deal since the episode was not the best in the series.

The other con, which i kinda find disturbing, is the picture shakeness in Kevin in Videoland. At times i find it to be a problem, but i'm use to that kinda thing from all the cartoons i have on VCD so i'm use to it but i'm sure others find it to be a problem.

Score: 8

Audio:

Pros: The music quality is pretty good, matter of fact its alot better then my vcd and the downloaded episodes i have collected through out the years. Its a great bonus to have the original intact in Season 2 that brings back so many memories that i haven't had since the days it was aired on NBC.

Cons: Now heres were it gets a bit vid and the reason why i'd score it so low and its mostly the fact that i find it disturbing that Season 2's music stayed in tact but Season 1 did not. My favorite of Season 1 was the Thriller that a girl sung but it would of brought back more memories if they got the rights to have them intacted. But i guess my VCDs will not be going away since all the original music is still on the episodes. Hopefully Season 3 will have them intact too.

Score: 8

Extras:

Pros: I like the design of the Character Profiles and Narriation, thats great to know stuff i didn't know about N Team and Mother Brain's Goons. The Preview for Kevin in Video land was great way to get into the series and the Captain Nintendo story is very interested to read and compare that to the cartoon series itself.

Cons: Well really is what i was most disappointed the most about the whole dvd more then the missing audio from Season 1. It could of used a few more profiles, but obiously the profiles were more towards the characters more in the series then anything else. Now just like how they did it for Legend of Zelda, they should of made the Captain Nintendo story downloadable in PDF format instead of reading it on the screen, it would of been better to have a printout and read it from there.

Score: 7

Overall:

Wow, just wow. I was very impressed and happy with the set, despite the few issues i think that could of need improvement. I mean even a perfect DVD set can also have room for improvements so don't hold that against me. My wishes were that all the promos and commerical break cuts made it to the dvd set but sadly they didn't have the rights to do that, but yet the music for Season 2 stayed in tact even though it was suppose to be cut. There is alot of good things and alot of bad things about this set but really you can't go wrong with it. If you are a fan of video games, espcially Nintendo, you'll like this series. Its what every gamer and nerds dream of all rolled up in a cartoon series. There was alot of things i wish DiC would of done to finish this series up but of course it wasn't in their control durning its time. It would of been nice to see the series conclusion somewhere down the road but other then the fanfics for the series, i don't think we'll see anything to end it nicely.

I'm just hoping that with the sales and that Nintendo can finally get the issue with Yoshi fixed up so Shout can release Captain N & Super Mario World out so we can finally get all the captain n series on dvd. But i guess we'll just have to wait and see. But overall its a great pickup and great to add to your collection

2667968,5,B000JBXHVY,"Despite me searching the net for years just to find even a few episodes of Captain N, bagging some chewed up videos, placing orders from dodgy sites that never arrived, obtaining nasty pirate copies and fake DVD's that barely worked, they've finally decided to release the series on DVD. And although I would have liked it to have been sooner, I suppose that it couldn't really have come at a much better time than this.

For those that don't know, the N in Captain N, stands for Nintendo, and seeing as Nintendo have swiftly restored their rightful place on the top spot of the video game world with the DS and the Wii, this show once again has a place.

The series, started in around 1991 was based around a kid called Kevin who got sucked through his Nes while playing Mike Tyson's Punch out, and found himself in Videoland, with the nes pad on his belt and the lightgun to get him through different worlds. His N team consisted of famous characters from Nes games such as Megaman, Kid Icarus and Simon Belmont from Castlevania. Seeing as the Wii has a device that allows you to download many of these old games, the series will make sense to even new generations of game players.

Anyway, at the end of the day, none of that really matters. What matters is whether or not the series was any good, and seeing as this was made during a time when Children's cartoons were at there best, and it had Nintendo funding, it's no surprise that it was. Some of it is amazing. The animation dipped after the first season, eventually going almost completely by the very end, but the stuff on this set is all good, including some of the best moments I ever saw in a kids show. Check out the two parter when they fight Big Eye in Megaman's world, and the way that at the end of every episode they played massive songs from the time, such as Michael Jacksons Thriller during an episode in Castlevania. It's so well made that as they journey through video game to video game, it will make you wanna pick up a nes again and start playing through the games yourself. Fortunately, the Wii should mean that you actually can.

So, to summarise, any Nintendo fan, any cartoon fan, buy this series. It was up there with Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters and others as one of the best kids shows going. If only they had released it when I was still 8 years old.",1161561600,13,2335,4.423255813953489

2668017,5,B000JBXHVY,"I was very excited to see this offered on DVD, I had most of the episodes taped on VHS however local television had a lot of static at the time so not all of the episodes were easy to view or had static like noise. This collection includes the first two seasons (which are the best as the third was way under budget so it didn't come out that good). The series is very funny especially with Simon Belmont who they made into a vain comic relief. The series is about a California High School student named Kevin along with his dog Duke who gets sucked into his TV and into Video Land where he meets a lot of popular characters as well as a few made up characters like Princess Lana. You have King Hippo from Punch-Out!! and the Eggplant Wizard from Kid Icarus who are the bad guy comic reliefs. As far as heroes go you have Pit (called Kid Icarus in the series), Simon Belmont, Megaman, and Princess Lana (the made up Princess of Videoland) as the main heroes Gameboy shows up in the second season as a real life Gameboy who can create things on his screen which then are materialized for his use which is cool. Link and Zelda make several appearances as well and were a pleasure to see in the Series. Mother Brain was considered the main enemy in the series but you see other major villains like Ganon from Zelda, and Donkey Kong who was turned into a King Kong like villain even though he is really just the size of a normal Gorilla. Surprisingly there is no Super Mario Bros. world even though Kevin mentions it in the very first episode however I guess with the back story of how Captain N was created it makes sense (this is included on the DVD if didn't know how this series was thought up). I recommend this collection for any Nintendo Fan and you'll laugh and enjoy a sense of nostalgia as you watch the episodes. I have to say my favorite world is Tetris as I love how everything is made of squares even the tires of their limos lol. The only negative thing I have to say about this collection (and they may have corrected this on newer versions) is that on one of the episodes Queen of the Apes where Mother Brain's cohort Dr. Wily invents a machine that can swap people's bodies; they are missing quite a huge chunk out of the middle of the episode (which had some of the best parts like Simon getting bit by a piranha) and the reason I know this is that I have the original taped. Other than that like I stated earlier I would highly recommend this collection to any Nintendo Fan such as myself as I myself have watched them many times over and over again.",1356393600,,2566,4.2818930041152266

2668019,5,B000JBXHVY,"I'm a huge fan of most cartoons that come from the 80's. There is only one thing i found wrong with this DVD Set. It's called Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series, but its not the whole series, a few yrs after this was realeased they released Captain N and the New Super Mario World, if you read one of the reviews it says ""It's the last 7 eps of Captain N: The game master"" so unless the re-released 7 episodes, the complete series dvd set is not complete.",1315872000,,468,4.0978260869565215

2668022,4,B000JBXHVY,"i was and still am a huge fan of the captain n series but they should have titled this release Captain N: Seasons 1-2, and not the complete series because season 3 is not included as it was part of the super mario world series, so the complete series title is completely baffling but still i'm glad they finally released this cartoon on dvd, now if only dic would license the show Kidd Video to be released to DVD that would be pretty awesome to revisit",1245628800,2,453,4.27906976744186
2668023,4,B000JBXHVY,"Although I enjoyed this box set, I couldn't quite go for the full 5-star rating due to one thing.  The episode entitled 'Videolympics' is apparently incomplete. In the end, the narrator says 'be sure to tune in next week' for the second part of this episode, it never did come across. I understand however, because one can only cram so much onto a CD/DVD in one sitting that some edits had to be made.",1216080000,,401,4.418918918918919
2668024,5,B000JBXHVY,"Kevin Keene was a teenaged video game fanatic with a messy bedroom.  Countless hours of his mundane life were frittered away amid the clutter as he pounded relentlessly on the big red buttons of his NES Advantage, stubbornly ignoring his nagging mother's incessant demands that he put down the joystick and clean up his pigsty.  Then, one fateful afternoon, Kevin's frivolous existence was instantly and radically changed, as the procrastinating gamer was suddenly pulled into the screen of his Sony television (along with his checkered curtains) in the middle of an epic Punch-Out fight.  His loyal canine friend, Duke, quickly jumped into the TV portal after him, and the two friends--now inexplicably transformed into cartoon characters--soon found themselves in the digitized realm known as Videoland, home of the pantsless redheaded angel-boy, Kid Icarus (who is afflicted with a most unusual speech impediment); the robotic mega-dwarf, Mega Man (who sounds like a chain-smoking chipmunk); the narcissistic vampire-hunting oaf, Simon Belmont; and, of course, her Royal Highnicus, the beautiful and vivacious Princess Lana.  Moments after Kevin's arrival, the bare-midriffed Princess presented the high school student with a Zapper gun and a Power Pad belt buckle and dubbed him Captain N, the Game Master.  She called upon the young earthling to defend Videoland in the kingdom's eternal struggle against the fiendishly grotesque jar of gray matter, Mother Brain (voiced by Levi Stubbs, Jr.), and her bumbling minions: the morbidly obese and perpetually shirtless King Hippo and the purple-skinned cyclops known as Eggplant Wizard.  Realizing that being the protector of a world populated by Nintendo characters would most assuredly free him forever of the daunting task of straightening up his room while simultaneously giving him an excuse to play video games 24-7, Kevinicus gladly accepted the jobicus.  As he and his N-Team cohorts warp from zone to zone blasting moglins and other assorted beasties into pixels, they encounter a myriad of NES legends like Donkey Kong; Link and Zelda; Bayou Billy (the Crocodile Dundee clone); Julio (the Paper Boy); Tetris World's Mayor Squaresly; and the elfin king of Faxanadu, a blue-faced Elvis impersonator called Melvis.

Chronicled here on four fantasticus DVDs, are 26 of Captain N's marvelously entertaining 8-bit adventures.  The discs come in two slim cases enveloped in a shiny black and red cardboard slipcover.  Fans who are gifted with exceptional memories will notice that the popular songs played in the background of Season 1's episodes have all been replaced with an instrumental version of ""Mega Move""--a ditty that can be heard during ""The Feud of Faxanadu"" on Disc 4.  Be forewarned that this tune will be permanently stuck in your head by the time you've finished watching these DVDs.  Aside from this baffling musical censorship, this is a mega nice seticus maximus.  The audio/video quality is not too impressive, but I guess that's to be expected for a show that's nearly twenty years old.  It should be noted that early copies of this collection lacked a few minutes of footage during ""Queen of the Apes"" on Disc 3, but my set, purchased in March of 2008, seems fine.  In the immortal words of Kevin Keene, a.k.a. Captain N, ""Call me corny, but man do I love this game!""",1206835200,,3342,5.208955223880597

While there are 34 episodes that chronical the adventures of Kevin (aka Captain N) and his team in Videoland, only 26 of them were in the series titled ""Captain N The Game Master"". Episode 27 through 34 appear in the series titled ""Captain N and the New Super Mario World"". The change-over took place during the end of season 2.  It's kinda like the show ""2 Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place"", which after a few episodes changed to a new series titled ""2 Guys and a Girl"".  Rest assured you can purchase the final 8 episodes of the Captain N saga right here on Amazon under the title of ""Captain N and the New Super Mario World"".
And for any Final Fantasy fans out there, I highly recommend purchasing  ""Captain N and the New Super Mario World""; the final episode ""The Fractured Fantasy of Captain N"" (my favorite episode), takes place in the realm of the original Final Fantasy.

2668038,4,B000JBXHVY,"Long before Pokemon hit the airways, during the late 80's early 90's, Nintendo had several cartoon series running including Super Mario, Zelda and Captain N. I never really got into the Mario cartoon and I doubt I watched a single episode of Zelda but Captain N made an indelible impression on my memory. The animation is fairly mediocre although it does improve over time. The plots are basic and the characters diverge considerably from the source material. In particular Megaman (aka The Blue Bomber) is drawn green and squatty and talks with a speech impediment. And speaking of impediments Kid Icarus has a speech affect that gets oldicus real fasticus. Simon Belmont is an arrogant dimwit rather than a heroic vampire hunter and Donkey Kong is a straight rip-off of King Kong.

Actually, the characters that I remembered most were Mother Brain's henchmen Eggplant Wizard and King Hippo. They were your typical mentally challenged underlings but somehow the shows creators managed to infuse them with enough charm and uniqueness that people still remember them two decades later. It's the small things like Hippo and Wizard that set this series apart. Captain N is definitely more than the sum of its parts. I'm not sure if Captain N would fall under the category of cult classic but it certainly says something that people still talk about the series this long after the show went off the air and there even exists a handful of websites devoted to Captain N that look as if some actual effort was put into them.

When it gets right down to it Captain N is going to be vastly more appealing to that certain segment of society that grew up playing the original NES system and watched cartoons in the late 80's early 90's. For instance, unless you've actually played Paperboy the episode `The Invasion of the Paper Pedalers' isn't going to have much meaning. On the other hand I never played Bayou Billy or Puss N' Boots but still enjoyed those episodes. The DVD special features are barely worth mentioning but in the end I don't regret getting this collection one bit. I just happen to fit the target demographic perfectly. In the end you get every episode that matters for a very reasonable price. At 9  hours it's quite a bit of bang for your buck.",1193702400,5,2255,4.747448979591836

2668040,4,B000JBXHVY,"I never watched the show religously as a child, mostly because it didn't run a long time, but I had fond memories of it since I grew up in the days of Nintendo mania.  After watching the complete set I was a little disappointed with how bad a lot of the stories were.  The animation was alright during the first season (but it got worse each season), the voice actors did a great job, but the story lines were just lame.  They tried to incorporate characters and items from various games of the NES era, but a lot of times they didn't stay true to the game itself they were taking ideas from.  In the end it was a good purchase if you were a fan of the show as a kid, or a videogame historian like myself.

2668041,3,B000JBXHVY,"This is a nice low cost set for those wanting a decent quality Captain N collection.

The most annoying thing about this set is the DVD Menu.

First off, every time you watch the DVD (unless using resume memory) you are FORCED to watch the entire introduction sequence to the Captain N Cartoon (ridiculous!). Though it is edited, it is not short enough and there is NO way to skip it since it is part of the menu!

Secondly, all discs use the same obscure menu with non functioning buttons pointing to all discs. This is quite bizarre and poorly designed.

The video is decent quality, they use double layer discs and put 5-6 episodes on a disc. The video is encoded w/ VBR (Variable Bit Rate) which unfortunately adds a ""pause"" to still shots (in order to save space) but overall isn't a major issue.

The cartoon is just as corny as ever, very few games & characters represent their original Japanese content accurately, most (if not all) games and characters are beyond recognition until stated by the Cartoon.",1182816000,,1013,4.605555555555555

Even though Mother Brain was from Metroid and Samus Aaron is not in any of the episodes it still was a great show.  This had great stories that featured few of characters from the great games, castlevaniea (sorry about the spelling), Mega-man, and Zelda (just to name a few).",1176163200,2,344,4.532258064516129
2668087,4,B000JBXHVY,"My all-time favorite cartoon has always been and will always be Captain N: The game master.  I remember growing up looking forward to saturdays just to watch this very awesome show.  When I found out it was coming to dvd, I almost had a heart attack.  I needed to get it, and I did.  However, it isn't as perfect as I wanted it to be, but good enough to call my own.

The only problems I find w/ the dvd set is: all the episodes are not there, an episode is edited heavily, cutting out 2 useful minutes of dialogue and action, and, lastly, an episode version or two of certain episodes are also missing.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I love Captain N, but I wanted it in all of its full glory so I can die happy.  Nonetheless, the series is still pristine, with loads of extras and great quality for the most part.  I'll just have to wait for more DVDs of the series, if any.  In the meantime, I'll deal w/ what I have and enjoy it to its greatest degree.  Hopefully, the Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog DVD set, when it comes out, won't disappoint either.",1175212800,,1054,4.1940298507462686

2668090,4,B000JBXHVY,"When I read the advertisements that Captain N was coming out with all thirty-four episodes, I was excited. I even pre-ordered my boxset in December of 2006. Well, unfortunately, you only get twenty-six episodes and they are just seasons one and two. I do hope that seasons three and four are realeased on to DVD very soon. Still, what I mentioned above about not having all the episodes isn't all bad. But, at least have lots of charactors in a show that deals with video games. For instance, The Super Mario Brothers, Toad, as well as King Koopa and his forces of evil, and the princess of the Mushroom kingdom if your going to talk about video land. Still, this isn't a bad DVD set if you love the classic Nintendo cartoons. This DVD set has no major violence. Lots of comic relief Thanks to Simon Belmont, and Duke Kevin's dog. You also get to see some comic relief from Egg plant wizard, ""Kidicarus,"" and King Hippo. Mike Tyson's punch out.""

Hi Jason,

  You are right, there was an error.  We are in the process of correcting the problem.  Once everything gets worked out we are going to make arrangements to manufacture the corrected disc, and give them out free to everyone that bought the box set.  This process will take about a month though, so the best thing to do is to hold on to your set and check back with us in a month or so.  We apologize for the incontinence.

so within a month you can send the disc in for a replacement",1174435200,18,712,3.923076923076923

2668093,5,B000JBXHVY,"I used to watch this cartoon when I was a kid. I loved it, though now it looks a LITTLE aged (sarcasm intended)...  however, it is a great cartoon. Before this DVD came out I had been scouring the internet to find episodes of Captain N only to find poor quality electronic versions or WAY over-priced VHS originals (20 - 50 dollars). When I found out about the DVD coming out, I was ecstatic. The DVD is great, though lacking in the extras. Essentially it's several DVD's of cartoons with some artwork thrown in as almost an afterthought. Also, when I bought it it through Amazon, I got it a day or two before the official release date (which was nice). If you're a Nintendo fan or saw the cartoons when you were a kid (or have kids now, for that matter), I recommend that you get this DVD.",1174262400,,790,4.302013422818792
2668094,3,B000JBXHVY,"Nintendo itself is a product of the 1980's which heralded the video gaming revolution. After much begging, my younger brother had both a Nintendo console and then a subscription to the tie-in magazine--but never the ultra-sugary breakfast cereal.

This animated kids show was another (perhaps the last!) attempt to cash in on the Nintendo empire--and for what it was (cash cow) it actually was pretty good.

A California teenager and his dog are somehow transported from his TV while playing video games (obviously Nintendo) into a parallel dimension where he discovers that those characters are both actually real and he is the Game Master. Considering how 'out of this world' the plot was, the series held up pretty well during it's original run.

I never really figured out what game Princess Lana was supposed to come from in the Nintendo empire even though I was aware of video game characters. Several of the other characters in this series were culled from Nintendo's video game library.

In a world where 'Buffy' perhaps now automatically springs into public consciousness with any connotation of the phrase 'vampire hunter' the Simon Belmont character might seem a little odd. However, he provides good-natured comic relief to viewing audiences. On another note, he also provides somebody for Kevin (who is supposed to be their team leader) to test his ideas off of. Simon is vain (he always carried a mirror around with him) but he is ultimately committed to getting his job done.

Other members of the `good team' include Kid Icarus (Kid Icarus and Mega Man (Mega Man), but oddly Mario and Luigi were spun off into their own separate show. However, considering they were Nintendo's 'main' characters--they should have been on this team helping save Videoland. I would think that if the series animators had the room/time to include characters from the Legend of Zelda in guest spots in this series, then they apparently weren't worried about 'big toons' overshadowing little and/or new ones.

Kevin and company are supposed to battle Mother Brain and other assorted badies from conquering Videoland, and then presumably taking over it. The DVD package says it's a complete series release--which is puzzling considering that there were obviously more episodes in the entire series than the ones which are being released.",1174089600,2,2330,5.102362204724409
2668095,4,B000JBXHVY,"I would probably rate this a 3/5 if it wasn't for the nostalgia that this brings back.

Its great for the fans of this show, or any of the cartoons of this time.

Pros:

its finally obtainable. I've never seen this shown on any networks anymore, or for sale (except when a kid, vhs)

Cons:

they changed the music - i heard they had to, but for those who remember, it kind of sucks. Not a big con, though.

Overall:

I consider this a great set for those who grew up with this, or is interested in these old game cartoons",1173312000,,521,4.099009900990099

It's the full series of Captain N: The Game Master and I'll give it 5 stars for nostalgia and because someone made an effort to release this product and I support that. I hope the whole 80s cartoon scene gets catalogued and released like a bunch of tagged, wild animals.

I gave this to someone from Washington D.C. and never saw it again so don't expect any updated review about the picture quality or the special features. No one really watches those things on these type of DVD's anyways - let's not kid ourselves.",1392940800,,547,4.47

I gave it a 4 because it does have some problems.  First of all - not enough episodes.  I can't believe this show didn't last longer.  That being said, you do actually get enough for the price.  The other bad things, anyone that watches and is a fan of the games represented will notice, are that many of the characters are different.  Mega Man is green instead of blue.  Pit is called Kid Icarus and has an annoying speech impediment.  Simon Belmont is completely changed.
