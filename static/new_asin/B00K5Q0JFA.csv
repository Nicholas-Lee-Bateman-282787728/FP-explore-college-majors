6403007,5,B00K5Q0JFA,"Cute story with June Allyson pretending to be a child prodigy, as her own little sister, in order to be ""discovered' by empresario Van Johnson, who takes her under his wing as her ""father"" figure, and prepares her for her big concert. Her bratty behavior backfires when she pushes him too far, dumping his booze in the pool and throwing his cigarettes into the fireplace after they both pledge not to drink or smoke because it'll stump her growth. While she's taking a cigarette break from her private stash, she catches him taking a dive to retrieve a bottle from the bottom of the pool. Throwing it back into the pool, Van takes matters into his own hands, so to speak, and teaches June a lesson in who's the adult and who's the child, and who gets to smoke and drink. When her fiance' tries to save her from the perfecto impresario, she has to decide whether to return with her ""big sister's"" fiance' or remain with her mentor, Van Johnson, and prepare for the concert of a lifetime. She knows that eventually the truth must be told that she's really Cynthia, her ""big sister"" and not Molly, her ""little sister,"" but finds that she has fallen in love with Van, and decides to go through with the concert.",1447200000,,1207,4.5159817351598175

6403009,5,B00K5Q0JFA,"Okay, what were they thinking?  This is a little bit revisionist about The Age of Consent, different in many States.  Can you make a movie with this title now?  Lolita-esque but happy.  Okay, with an age-difference cast?  Show her kissing him, not the other way around.  Crossdress her into a little girl.  Are we supposed to say Yum?  Just put on your Disney hardhat and go along with the joke.  Love the Plot.  June Allyson was wholesomeness incarnated, at least on the Big Screen.  Books claiming Scandals came a lot later.  So did Lolita movies, when Shock became more and more possible as Hollywood discovered Greed.  Meanwhile, enjoy this family-friendly vision of a distant past.",1433808000,4,686,4.860869565217391

6403012,1,B00K5Q0JFA,"Not as good as other V. Johnson/J. Allison movies. Boring, exaggerated emphasis on cigarettes and alcohol, no humour, a chore to get through.",1419292800,,141,5.173913043478261
