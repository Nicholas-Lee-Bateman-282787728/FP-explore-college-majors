Just this last Holiday Season I was able to find it on Amazon in a DVD version, I thought after all this time the boys may have gotten to old to enjoy the movie...smiles from ear to ear on my youngest grandson's face once the package was opened -he immediately played it three times from beginning to end!

There are ""bad guys"" sure, but no guns or anything really intense and the kids in the movies get to be the heroes by outsmarting the bad guys.  Hard to find a good show with a fun plot for young kids (age 5-10) without guns, shooting, etc.  academy award winner?  Of course not.

1708334,3,B000065U5K,"Having previously viewed a full frame Allumination 2/14/2006 DVD of `Horse Crazy' from a local library, I browsed that title on Amazon.com, noticed a widescreen version was listed among the half dozen DVD versions, and wondered whether the feature was shot with the intent of being viewed at full frame or widescreen aspect. I ordered a $0.20 new DVD (plus $2.98 shipping) from an Amazon.com third party seller that was listed on the page for the 6/4/2002 full frame DVD from MTI Home Video. What I received was a DVD not described among any of the `Horse Crazy' DVDs on Amazon.com and whose cover is significantly different from any of those shown.  It arrived in a slim-pak case (half the thickness of a typical keep case) distributed by Artist View Entertainment copyrighted 2003. Neither the cover nor the disc label indicate whether it is full frame or wide screen or what its aspect ratio is. It is a 1.78:1 aspect anamorphic wide screen version of `Horse Crazy' and I was happy to see that the movie works well at that aspect. However, only about one in every four frames shows a sharp image when displayed frame-by-frame, while virtually every frame from the library's Allumination disc is sharp; still, it is worth what I paid. When its sharp frames are compared with the Allumination DVD, the top and the bottom of the Allumination image has been cropped, but it doesn't appear to add slightly more image to the sides as would be evident were it remastered from 35 mm film shot with spherical lenses. The one `Horse Crazy' wide screen DVD listed on Amazon.com lists that it was released 8/11/2009 by Good Times Home Video at 1.85:1 aspect. GoodTimes Home Video began business in 1984 distributing primarily copies of public domain titles. It expanded into GoodTimes Entertainment, but filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and its assets were sold to Gaiam (who may have rereleased the DVD Amazon.com lists).",1341100800,2,1909,4.837920489296636
1708385,2,B000065U5K,"I thought my almost 5 year old, horse-obsessed daughter would love this movie.  While she liked it, there were some things I didn't like about it.  There's kidnapping first off, which isn't violent, but certainly not what I expected.  Then there's a trusted family friend who turns out to be a ""good guy gone bad"", which just again isn't sending a message a 5 year old should be getting (IMO).  There was a lot of anger, yelling and to be honest, NOT a whole lot of horse in it.",1323820800,2,478,4.337078651685394

1708391,5,B000065U5K,"Story starts out in your average suburban home, Mum, Dad, Big brother, little brother and little bossy sister.  Little brothers dreams of the wild horses every night and little sister worries about this.  They have a friend at school they call 'Tex' who says he is a cowboy from Texas.  A special bond is formed between the three little friends when it is discovered that Tex really lives in a trailer and is not from Texas, he is worried that his new friends will desert him but this does not happen only brings them closer together.

They concoct a scheme to run away to Nevada  (by stowing away in big brothers car) to catch a mustang each and bring them home and keep them in the garage!

Many adventures are had along the way when the trio runs into a team of horse rustlers who try to steal 'General' a famous show horse that the kids have found and 'tamed' all by themselves, unaware that he is not a mustang. They end up being held hostage by the rustlers.

Lots of drama and excitement when the trio are pursued individually by the bad guys and the many clever tricks used by the kids to outsmart their dumb captors!

Happy ending for all when the crooks are caught, General is returned to his rightful owner and love blossoms for big brother and Generals owners daughter.

A really enjoyable 'feel good' movie with drama, excitement a little romance  and of course, horses galore!  I thoroughly recommend this movie to young and not so young, very entertaining.",1279152000,,1471,4.534090909090909

We have it in our car when we go on road trips.  When I need him to go to sleep, I have to shut the movie off otherwise he fights sleep just to watch it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horses or has a horse crazy kid.

What a surprise.  When I saw this DVD, I ordered it.  We all watched it again and again.  I am over 50, and I got as big a kick out of it as did my grandchildren.  The imagination and plotting and actions of the kids in the movie are so refreshing and enjoyable.  I laughed out loud several times.  This is a great movie for all ages, but especially for children who can benefit from wholesome entertainment not full of bad imitative behavior.  Do you know anyone who can benefit?  If you do, make a gift to them of this movie and watch it with them and enjoy!",1250726400,2,731,4.262773722627737
1708436,1,B000065U5K,I bought this DVD because my daughter LOVES horses.  I bought it after reading the reviews and am greatly disappointed.  The movie is awful and doesn't show horses in it as much as I would have thought.  The plot of the movie is scary for young children.  I wasted my money.,1249862400,6,274,4.313725490196078

1708443,5,B000065U5K,"Horse Crazy a delightful story of two 8 year old boys and a 7 year old girl who sneak a ride in a car to Nevada to lasso themselves three wild mustangs and ride them home.  They experience lessons of honestly, over coming fears, teamwork, and friendship that will bound them for a life time. Even the older brother (maybe 20'sh) learns how special and important his brother and sister are and a little about himself.  I don't think you have to have small children left in the house to buy this movie.  My children are grown and I still bought it.  I laughted, almost cried with delight and even found myself sitting on the edge of my seat as the kids undergone some of their adventures.  BUY IT!  I have watched it over and over again and love it even more each time I view it.

I first saw this movie on cable and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD. It's light and funny, with some great scenery.  The horse is quite beautiful, too.

The horse crazy kids thought they could catch a wild horse and bring it home after seeing a tape on wild horses in class. It gets a tad more complicated with two bad guys going after a prize winning horse they want to capture and get money for. But it interlocks with the storyline,and makes for a very sweet show! It can catch the eye of all ages. I am  thirteen and my sisters are,ten,and four and we all have watched this show for years now,renting it over and over again at the video store. I would recommend it to anyone!",1154131200,6,648,4.176
1708477,4,B000065U5K,"This movie was both fun and adorable at the same time. The child actors gave strong performances and portrayed distinctive and engaging characters. The adult actors provided strong support throughout the entire movie. The scenery was fantastic and there was plenty of light humor throughout this movie. The plot wasn't quite believeable, but it wasn't so far-fetched that it wasn't enjoyable. An eight-year-old boy who dreams of owning his own horse seizes an opportunity to sneak a ride to Nevada with his older brother (who is going to visit his girl friend who he winds up dropping) in order to capture wild mustangs. Two other kids wind up sneaking along. Add a couple of horse theives into the mix and a pretty young lady to attract the interest of the older brother and things get interesting. Who would enjoy watching this movie? One audience is likely to be children under the age of ten. The pacing, humor, and action in the movie would attract this audience. The other main audience that would apprectiate this movie is adults who get a kick out of silly kid movies. This movie does a good job of presenting a captivating story without getting preachy or sappy in any way. There were a couple of moral lessons thrown in along the way, but they fit seemlessly into the plot and don't seem forced in any way. There is also a strong and appealling sub-plot in this movie involving a budding romantic relationship between two people in their early twenties which integrates quite naturally with the main plot.",1148774400,2,1515,4.786259541984733

Lots of exciting scenes, the kids get to be the heroes, and it isn't too scary for the little ones.  Our teenaged neighbors enjoy the movie, just as much as my not-yet-teens do.
