7955929,4,B00005V1YS,"Thought that Phil Silvers was a definite improvement over Frankie Howerd. The fact that Silvers was resented for a superior paycheck over the regular game is understandable,but he wasn't at fault,but the producers offered and he took (sort of like pool nurses given the business by staff nurses when pool nurses don't get benefits at all,unlike reg staff).I really enjoyed this film,could see Brian Donlevy in Ken Williams Comandant among others,like the Polish actor similar to an actor in Beau Geste.",1418515200,,502,5.209876543209877
7955930,4,B00005V1YS,This is a nice entry with many of the original Carry On gang plus Phil Silvers playing Sgt. Bilko in the Foreign Legion. Some funny stuff but suffers a little from trying to give Silvers a lot of the limelight. Still one of the better entries and Bresslaw plays a great Arab chieftan. Hawtry and Williams are wonderful as always. Got this for $9.90 and well worth it.,1258502400,,367,4.411764705882353
7955931,5,B00005V1YS,"I have always loved this film as it features a surprisingly sexy belly dance by Anita Harris as the duplicitous Corktip. As a kid I was aware of Ms. Harris, as she often appeared on British TV in the sixties as a wholesome family singer. This film made me see her in a whole new light!",1051315200,4,285,4.107142857142857
7955932,2,B00005V1YS,"Carry On Follow That Camel (1967)  lacks the pace and sparkle of some of the Carry On's other historical epics which is surprising as it was always the period comedies where the team scored best. The fact that Sid James, Barbara Windsor and Hattie Jaques are missing may have something to do with it. As a substitute for the absence of Sid James, the team brought in American comedian Phil Silvers who enjoyed success with his self-titled television show in the 1960's. Basically Silvers reprises his role as Sergeant Bilko in this entry (his only Carry On) and it doesn't quite blend in so well with the rest of the teams characterisations although there are some laughs to be along the way.
After being accused of cheating in a cricket match, Bertram Oliphant (Jim Dale in a familiar characterisation) gives up his fiancee (Angela Douglas) and with his bumbling butler Simpson in tow (Peter Butterworth) joins the Foreign Legion. The Fort he ends up in, which is run by Sergeant Knocker (Phil Silvers) soon comes under seige from Seeikh Abdul Abulbul (played brilliantly by Bernard Bresslaw who relishes every manically evil moment).
The desert scenes are vastly impressive and other regulars of the cast such as Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey and Joan Sims (who is shamefully underused in this one though still puts inan effective performance as the sultry and exotic Zigzig) but the feel-good factor of most of the Carry On films is evidently missing here. Though there are some laughs to be endured the film can best be described as just enjoyably average overall.",1036454400,4,1572,4.909774436090226
