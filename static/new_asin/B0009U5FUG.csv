2319337,2,B0009U5FUG,"There are, without a doubt, many things to dislike about this, extremely low budget, film.  I could begin to tear apart the stilted acting, the uninspired direction, the confusing plot (yes, there is a plot), the lack of any convincing vehicles, and the really bad creature effects, but you know what, despite all of that, I actually liked this film.  It wasn't the cheesy acting and effects that I liked, it was that this production group decided to make a movie that they knew was way out of their budget.  Despite cutting almost every single corner they could fine, they still managed to come up with a couple of good effects, a couple of good plot ideas, and one or two characters that I ended up liking quite a bit.  The scene when the giant spider comes out of the ground reminded me of those old Godzilla movies and I was pretty pleased with how it looked.  The vehicle models, while not convincing enough to be real, did have the same type of look and feel that models in a Godzilla movie have.  Yes, there are a ton of things wrong with this movie, but they did a few things right.  Slice your way through the cheese, and you might just have a good time watching this.  I really wish we could give half stars, because I feel this movie deserves more than two stars, but three is way too generous.",1161388800,3,1305,4.385892116182573
2319338,5,B0009U5FUG,"If you don't have a taste for ""bad movies"" then skip this movie. But if you love movies like Terror Toons, Drainiac(s), Killjoy, Asylum of the dead etc... THIS MOVIE MUST BE IN YOUR LIBRARY. It is one of the best ""Worst"" movies ever created. It is a cinematic failure of catastrophic proportions. Cheesy special effects, unexplainably rediculous lines like, ""Ive seen alot of things in my day, but NEVER have i seen a military instalation full of spiderwebs!"" and so on. This movie is pure comedy from begining to end. On the other hand it is a tad long for some reason but it is shocking from begining to end. Again, realisticly this is not a good movie. But for those of you who love to watch cheesy horror movies (although i wouldent consider this horror) your collection would be lonely without this movie. Absolutely Hilarious.",1141516800,7,832,4.666666666666667
2319339,1,B0009U5FUG,"WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...

This is the worst bug movie since BITE ME, and that's saying a lot. I retract everything that I've said about the Asylum being the worst horror production company around. That award has to go to Creep FX, the company behind this movie and the equally horrible Centipede!

But you know, at least CENTIPEDE! had some beauty shots of India, and they seem to have actually shot on location. For locations, Creepies has a bunch of little balsa-wood train villages that are supposed to pass for the streets of Los Angeles.

So the movie starts out when some kind of military experiment goes awry. Those silly mad military scientists, always making a new strain of spiders as the ultimate weapon when a nuclear bomb seems to work just fine.

These military super spiders escape and start multiplying all over Los Angeles. The military sends out helicopters and tanks after them. Spiders of all shapes and sizes, some made out of rubber, some made out of plastic, attack matchbox cars and a remote control tank from Radio Shack.

Creepies is almost bad enough to be funny, but it just takes itself too seriously. So, rather than laughing at the movie, you just wind up being mad at yourself for wasting an hour and a half of your life. This movie makes other monster spider movies like EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS look like masterpieces. Even if you like campy horror movies from Troma and Full Moon, you might want to skip this one.",1136246400,3,1454,4.708661417322834
2319340,1,B0009U5FUG,"There is really not much good to say about this movie except that the people who made it probably had a lot of fun. So much fun that according to IMDB they are making a sequel. Picture yourself and a bunch of your friends getting together with a general idea of what you want to do and making up the rest as you go. Do you think a lot of folks besides your friends and family would want to watch it? If so, then you may like this movie. If not, then odds are you won't. The acting is dreadful, the special effects are commical, and the plot is pretty weak.",1129766400,,556,4.018018018018018
2319341,3,B0009U5FUG,"CREEPIES is so unabashedly bad, it falls into the category of prime cut cheese.  See...spiders that look like ladybugs decimate corpses; see giant spiders bounce from building to building; see ridiculous miniatures of cars, tanks, etc., getting blown to bits; see giant spider fall on the famous Hollywood sign.  The movie is so poorly done it's almost a classic.  Add a horrible soundtrack from a group called Wanda and the Marbles; add horrifying performances from all the cast; at least it doesn't drag too much.  If you really like cheesy horror films, you'll love CREEPIES and know that there's a CREEPIES 2 coming too!!!",1127952000,,626,4.990384615384615

Ok, Im not even going to really review this as i rented three movies from Blockbuster the other day 1-Creepies 2-Feeding the Masses 3- The Wickeds, with only being pleased some what with The Wickeds.

The movie the Creepies is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It goes in the category off any type of bad horror film be it Slasher or Zombie, this is top 5 horrible. The acting is so damn horrible the plot is Ok, everything else is just crap, everything I mean everything is CGI all animated. And yes the effects are truly horrible and the Gore is just Mediocre. The tanks they sit in are absolutly fake as can be as all the machine parts in the tank look like childrens toys and when they look throught some type of monitor to see whats out side,oh man lol, these effects are the worst I have ever seen , I thought the effects in Feeding the Masses was bad, damn was I wrong . The Creepies is the worst movie I have ever seen, so damn bad you cant stop watching it its so damn funny. Im tsuck betrween not knowing which is the worst film I have evr seen and they are Corpses are Forever or the Creepies, Corpses are forever considering the Creepes was so horrible it had me in tears.

Please do not waste money on this, if youa re considering ti rent first and thats still a waste. If you want rent the Wickeds which was good and they have a 3 minute clip of the Creepies on there, OH man was this movie bad, every aspect. Dont waste your money.

i know thgis review was probably not helpful in many ways I just don't know what to say",1124409600,5,1589,4.14935064935065

8066566,4,B0009U5FUG,"Wow, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what I just watched. We have toy spiders, the s***tiest CGI ever, and I'm pretty sure in one scene they used a stuffed animal spider! We also get to witness awful acting and a blatant ripoff of Return of the Living Dead. I've seen plenty of low budget horror and this is definitely one of the worst. Or the best?

I really do love horror movies about giant mutated bugs and spiders, and I will admit that a handful of them are pretty lame, but this is ridiculous! It is as if the makers of this movie went out of their way to make the cheesiest movie they possibly could. From the horrible effects to the lack of a plot, this one really takes the cake.

8066568,3,B0009U5FUG,"This is a low budget shot on digital video movie that is mainly recommended for bad movie fans.  The story is simple and the spiders range in size from big to Godzilla type sizes.  It has a fast pace and contains cheap gore FX, but there's no nudity; and they used toy models instead of CGI for the scenes where the giant spiders are destroying the city and battling the army.  At least it isn't slow and there's gore throughout the film.  Bad movie fans might have some fun with it.  If you're looking for a well made shot on digital video movie I wouldn't recommend it.

The DVD is in very good quality, but it has no commentary or behind the scenes extras.",1340496000,,659,4.274193548387097

CREEPIES has got to be the most impressive movie I've seen in quite some time. Why, I hear you asking? Plain and simple: because it's almost unbelievable what director Jeff Leroy has achieved with an extremely limited amount of money. CREEPIES' ultra-low budget is supposed to be US$ 20,000 I read somewhere else (don't know if this is really true though).

Don't get me wrong! I mostly enjoy all those big-budget hundred-million-dollar Hollywood blockbusters too, but what Jeff Leroy has put on the screen with a laughable budget impresses me more than all those Michael Bay/George Lucas/Steven Spielberg/Roland Emmerich event movies put together. Besides, in stark contrast to most mainstream films that lack soul, B-movies like CREEPIES have the heart at their right place, and they are literally bursting with something that money just can't buy: charm!

***Warning***Small Spoilers ahead***

The general plot of CREEPIES is clearly inspired by Dan O'Bannon's fun-classic THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD: scientists who tried to create the ultimate weapon dispose of their rather unsuccessful experiments in small containers from which they promptly manage to escape and attack Los Angeles. While the bad-tempered spiders (that even communicate among each other in one hair-raisingly funny scene) attack the helpless citizens and prowl the city the military goes into full action and sets in ruins all that comes by their telescopic sight: the commanding officer doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that they don't manage to hit the rioting gigantic spider... seems one has to reckon with collateral damage in such a case.

Spiders are running through the streets and attack people, buildings, cars, even whole streets are exploding, tanks are rolling around, helicopters are firing from all guns... just to point out the proportions: if this film was made in Hollywood it would have cost, at least, 150 million dollars. B-movie maverick Jeff Leroy made it for approx. 20,000 dollars. In other words: for one big budget Hollywood blockbuster, B-movie directors like Jeff Leroy could make about 7,500 films! Quite stunning, ain't it?

However dirt-cheap CREEPIES is, the entertainment value certainly does not suffer from that. The many spiders may be for the most part from the computer (I'm not really sure in some cases though)... the L. A. and Hollywood of the flick is definitely not. The film makers built and/or organized countless miniature buildings, streets and cars, only to have them spectacularly destroyed in the course of the movie (even screaming dummies are flying through the air). Indeed, Leroy manages to resurrect the brilliant-trashy Godzilla feeling of the 1960s and 1970s, when he rages in his toy-land like all those gigantic Japanese monsters in their heydays. You can even marvel at a fantastic atomic explosion! Okay, I admit it: I'm crazy 'bout miniatures, and CREEPIES is filled to the brim with them.

In contrast to those wonderful Kaiju Eiga spectacles Leroy doesn't shy away from some astonishing bloodshed. A man shoots his own head off like Bobby Peru in WILD AT HEART, and another guy (who was bitten by a spider) scratches his whole face off. The cast is fine for this kind of movie (Phoebe Dollar is always awesome); they certainly will never win an academy award, but they are a joy to watch and seem to have invested a lot of enthusiasm in the making of the movie. Look out for a cameo by 'the Hedgehog' in person, Ron Jeremy.

CREEPIES can't (and doesn't want to) compete with Hollywood product like the excellent EIGHT-LEGGED FREAKS. But it's a great flick in its own right, immensely entertaining, chock full of fun and trash situations, the protagonists are sympathetic, and the countless special effects (obviously made with imagination, enthusiasm and love) are truly bursting with charm. No doubt about it, most mainstream film fans will scream loudly that this has got to be the worst movie ever made. Well, let them think they are right and let them live happily in their small brainwashed-by-Hollywood dream world. True B-movie aficionados will know at once what a great achievement CREEPIES really is.

Seems that the B-movie industry beyond Hollywood is alive and kicking. CREEPIES proves this most impressively. Buy it and see for yourself.

Oh, one more thing: Mr. Leroy, please keep on making movies. There are a lot of people out there who love the films you make. I know it.",1216425600,2,4465,5.07912687585266
