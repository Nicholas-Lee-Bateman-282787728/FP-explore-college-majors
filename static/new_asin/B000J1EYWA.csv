8340912,5,B000J1EYWA,"I am an 8th grade U.S. History teacher and use this video every year to introduce the Constitution to my students.  I also teach a high school government class in the summer and use it effectively with that age group.  The segment on the Constitutional Convention is produced in a very funny, interesting and fast-paced way that keeps kids attention.  I also used the segment on Gideon v. Wainwright to show how the Supreme Court interprets the law.  Students retained these concepts better than in previous years without using this video.  I recommend this DVD to anyone trying to teach a civics class.",1267574400,,603,4.815533980582524
