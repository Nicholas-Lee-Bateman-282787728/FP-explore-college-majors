8343803,5,B001UIBF50,"I enjoyed this alot.  It deals with the mind's inability to cope with reality, by
creating a more desirable reality in the illusion of schizophrenia.  The characters are more than enjoyable (and a pleasure to look at).  In some ways, one could wish the story had two endings; or rather that maybe two separate stories could really have taken place.  We hated parting with the false -- but still rooted for the truth.  An odd place.  But I was suprised this was an Indian film, not expecting it would be quite so intriguing psychologically.  Bravo!",1249776000,,547,4.6947368421052635
