8422489,3,B004BWP9YK,"With considerable bonafides in front of and behind the camera, and a very effective opening ten minutes or so, Stolen Holiday offered much promise. However  aside from a few good moments nothing ever really holds together, not the romantic main story or the skullduggerish subplot. Miss Francis is as luminous as ever; shes her usual reliable self portraying a well-heeled character (especially adorned as she is in those Orry-Kelly-designed Thirties Paris-chic outfits). In a lively performance that anticipates his better-known roles as Capt. Renault in Casablanca and Sebastian in Notorious, Rains is superb as her business partner, best friend and wannabe romantic interest. He was always so good at playing complex (but sympathetic) villains.

Nominal romantic lead Ian Hunter never makes much of an impression. Actually I thought Francis had a lot more chemistry with Rains than Hunter. Alison Skipworth almost steals the movie, providing the comic relief and a touch of wisdom as Kay Franciss assistant and self-appointed social secretary. Director Michael Curtiz keeps things moving along but even he can do only so much with such limited material. Interesting the career arcs of the leads: Kay Francis was beginning a downward slide by 1937, but Rains had his best years ahead of him, especially the 1940s. As for Hunter I don't know enough about to opine, but suffice to say that he never became a huge star.

Later in the same year Kay Francis would appear again with Hunter as a romantic twosome in the similarly less-than-stellar Another Dawn, then again in the somewhat more highly regarded Confession. Nonetheless, Stolen Holiday is recommended, especially for Rains, Curtiz and Francis completists.",1494028800,,1714,5.294117647058823
8422490,5,B004BWP9YK,"No one does it like Kay did.  The profile, the clothes, the walk!  I am a forever fan and loved this complicated movie with all the twists and turns.  Ian Hunter is darling in the movie as he always was.  It's a must see for pre code lovers.",1419724800,2,241,3.9583333333333335
8422491,5,B004BWP9YK,"Stolen Holiday was released in 1937. Kay Francis atarred at the top of her career success in Hollywood. As a high fashion designer she powers this woman's picture along very nicely. Good support is provided by Alison Skipworth in another greatr character role. Kay Francis fans, and lovers of classic films will like this the most.",1416960000,,331,4.928571428571429
8422492,4,B004BWP9YK,This movie is more of a vehicle for Claude Raines than Kay Francis. Of course who could fault him in Casablanca? Kay Francis appears to just read lines. Predictable story line but Claude brings it together. Watchable movie. A side note for aircraft enthusiasts - keep an eye out for a rare shot of a Handley Page Hannibal class airliner.,1402185600,3,337,4.633333333333334
8422493,4,B004BWP9YK,I enjoy watching Kay Francis not so much for her acting which was good but for her presence and the clothes that she was dressed in. The ending did surpise me. It was good.,1356652800,5,172,4.088235294117647
8422494,3,B004BWP9YK,"This is not a movie I feel entirely competent to review, since it is, to some degree, what was once called a woman's picture.  It deals to a large extent with who Kay Francis' character will give her heart to.  Yet it also deals with  the financial skulduggery of Claude Rains' character (it is very loosely based on the French ""Stavisky Affair"" of the early 1930's) and Michael Curtiz' direction keeps things moving along very snappily - the picture never really drags as the phrase ""woman's picture"" might make one expect.

It was apparently an ""A"" production for Warner Brothers; the sets, props, and costumes (as one might expect in a Kay Francis film) are all first rate.  The print is virtually perfect, and the transfer to DVD seemed excellent on a friend's big-screen HDTV.

The movie is set in Paris and starts in 1931, with Kay Francis as a French couture model who looks exactly like Kay Francis did in 1931, slicked-back hair and all.  Her gown in these first scenes is so low-cut I am surprised it got past the censors in post-Code 1937. Perhaps the ball of flowers the size and shape of a cantaloupe that is mounted in the center of the neckline distracted them.  She then meets Claude Rain's character, Who Is Not What He Seems.  She helps him anyway, and a couple of minutes later it is 1936 and they are the toast of Paris - he as a financier and philanthropist, she as a clothing designer.  (Having it be the other way around was inconceivable in 1936.  At least they allowed her to be a success on her own; she specifically remarks on having paid back all Orloff's money.)

The movie goes from there, with Orloff's financial dealings coming into jeopardy and Kay's character meeting a nice young British diplomat with whom she falls in love, apparently because he is the only other major male character in the movie.  Played by Ian Hunter, he is a nice enough guy, but way behind Rains for charm and personality, if not sterling honesty.  Heck, IMHO, he's way behind Ralph Bellamy.  It seemed strange to me that during five years in Paris Francis' character had not met someone at least that charming already, but that is what the script called for.

Anyway, conventional morality is served in the end, and the right things happen to the right people, which is all very well if you like that kind of thing.  The Production Code kept Hollywood from surprising people in 1937 the way they could in 1931.  The script was more or less a potboiler, but it gave Francis and Rains opportunities for wit, charm, and drama, and they made good use of them.

It is perhaps a very routine movie, but as I said, it zips right along, and it is done with great skill in every technical department.  Perhaps for a 1930's audience it showed how people could rise if given a chance, and also showed a comeuppance for the kind of financial trickery many blamed for the Crash of '29 and the ensuing Depression.  I also liked the way that while Alison Skipworth's character served as comic relief, it was by being perceptive or acerbic, not by being ridiculous.

For me, three minor points of interest stood out:

1) Kay Francis's appearance ala 1931, as noted above.

2) An airliner the principal characters take from Paris to Geneva.  It was apparently (according to poster browntmsu on the IMDB) a Handley Page H.P.42W, and it has to be seen to be believed - it has wings and engines everywhere.

3) A pistol used near the end of the movie.  It is a Roth Steyr Model 1907, an Austro-Hungarian cavalry pistol from the First World War.  It amazes me that Warner Brothers would have such an obscure gun on hand, and would use it just to give a bit of ""European"" flavor to a shot lasting perhaps two seconds.  The studio system had some truly amazing resources.",1338595200,6,3758,4.55886736214605
