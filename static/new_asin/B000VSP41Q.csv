8219802,1,B000VSP41Q,"This movie would be a decent one if you could watch it for free on the internet, but is absolutely not something to sell for money. Just some pictures, some music, and narration. No facts, no science, no footage. Very bad.",1233878400,3,222,4.439024390243903
8219803,5,B000VSP41Q,"Ancient cultures of all races recorded an event that was so catastrophic that it nearly destroyed all life on earth and forever changed the planet... Did a run away planet called Tiamat and Marduk nearly collide with the Earth in ancient times?
Are Stone Hedge, the Great Pyramid, the Mayan pyramids and other monoliths markers, to warn us where to look for other such events in the future? Did an ancient race of giants called the Nephilim/Fallen Angels construct these monuments, and are they coming back?
Why were the Mayans so worried about 2012 and who warned them? Where are the Hall Of Records and how many other ancient libraries still exist?
Is the Mayan prophecy of 2012 the same prophecy of Revelations in the Bible? Very good observations! I enjoyed it.",1223683200,4,765,4.803030303030303

8219805,5,B000VSP41Q,"Its true what the arragant loud mouth critics say....if your looking for Star Wars like animation,this is not your DVD. But considering the poor guy made this with no money on his spare time and with no help.....JOB WELL DONE! HIP HIP HURRAY....",1198195200,2,245,4.72093023255814
8219806,1,B000VSP41Q,"It seems like a high school animation project gone bad.  Poor animation content. Poor audio content. A total lack of any coherence.  Absolutely not worth the money, even if you bought it for one dollar.",1197763200,,202,4.742857142857143
8219807,2,B000VSP41Q,"his video does have some good information. However, it consists of more of a slide show of bad pitures than of any video, and even worse is the commentary. It sound like two people are talking on the phone. It's a bit muffled and seems like they just threw together a very poor quality video. If you want a good 2012 video, try ""The Horizen Project"". It is extremely informative and a far supperior quality to this dvd.",1197072000,7,419,4.384615384615385
8219808,1,B000VSP41Q,"I have great respect for Patrick Heron but this was a waste of 10.00. As Charles Stump said it's poor graphics and to use a radio tape on a DVD was ridiculous. If I had it to do over I would not have bought such a poor quality production.

8219809,1,B000VSP41Q,"Poor graphics, taped radio broadcast, what was this production company thinking?
In this day and age there are better graphics and audio editors available to make this a better programme, unfortunately I found out after I downloaded this poor excuse of an movie!",1194739200,5,262,5.116279069767442
8219810,5,B000VSP41Q,"Some people will not WANT to see this, if they are closed minded and have fundementalist views. For the rest, I think you will find the observations and connections made to be very interesting at the least. If you have pre concieved IDEAS and do not wish to challenge them, don't watch.",1193702400,4,286,4.519230769230769
8219811,1,B000VSP41Q,"You know, I am sick of all of these so called ""scientists"" who make sensationalist claims with no evidence and expect us to believe it.  This documentary is full of so much speculation and garbage that is passed off as fact, it makes me sick.  Don't bother with this video; it is worthless; absolutely worthless.

""We really didn't know anything about our universe until about the late 40's.""  What?!  These people have no clue of the history of astronomy at all!",1192838400,5,463,4.666666666666667
