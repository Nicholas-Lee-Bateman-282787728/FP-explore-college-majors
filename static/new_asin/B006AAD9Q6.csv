4981689,3,B006AAD9Q6,"This is not what I was expecting it to be. I was anticipating learning about the content of the Dead Sea Scrolls - what we can extrapolate about the validity of modern Biblical text from comparisons with Dead Sea Scroll writing. However, no mention is made of the actual content of the scrolls with the exception of scrolls that detailed the daily rituals and beliefs of the Sons of Light. The focus of the presentation is on the Sons of Light (Essenes) who lived in Qumran at the time when the scrolls were stored there. Conjectures are made as to whether or not the Sons of Light created the scrolls or whether they were imported, what their daily life was like, their beliefs, and their termination. The overall quality of the presentation is well done, with high quality narration and accompanying music. There is some helpful information on various modern techniques being used to gather more information from the scrolls, but the overall DVD would be better titled: ""Sons of Light: Voices from the Desert.""",1457136000,35,1012,4.788571428571428
4981690,4,B006AAD9Q6,I like this one. It moves a bit slow at times but gives a good overview of the story. I may watch it again to garner all the information.,1456617600,,137,3.7586206896551726

4981692,4,B006AAD9Q6,Enjoyed the latest documentary about the Scrolls and found a lot of information I had not heard before.  Recommend it for those interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the findings of all those decoding them.,1456531200,,207,4.75

4981704,5,B006AAD9Q6,Very informative and well presented.,1469491200,,36,6.4
4981705,5,B006AAD9Q6,Very interesting; a lot of new information is presented about the Scrolls since they were discovered. The Scrolls are beginning to picture the life and time of Hebrews over 2000 years ago. I hope we learn more.,1468713600,,210,4.702702702702703
4981706,3,B006AAD9Q6,disappointed...thought it would be better.,1468540800,,42,7.6

4981715,3,B006AAD9Q6,"I was disappointed because the date that appeared on the Amazon listing was 2016 so I thought there was new information on the ongoing research. However, the copyright date was actually 1997 or 1998 so it was all info that I had seen long ago. Is 2016 just the date that it became available on Amazon?",1465430400,8,301,4.392857142857143
4981716,2,B006AAD9Q6,"This video was moderately interesting in the beginning, but related almost nothing about the scrolls or what was contained within them. It dealt mostly with the composition of the vases, and about the area/peoples where they were discovered.",1465430400,,241,5.368421052631579
4981717,2,B006AAD9Q6,"Perhaps my expectations were set incorrectly by the title but I was hoping for more insight regarding what life was like at that point in history and any religious confirmation or conflict
 Instead the documentary seemed to focus more on the process of decifering and seemed to be a defense against sceptics.",1465430400,,308,4.923076923076923
4981718,2,B006AAD9Q6,"This is nothing new to followers of The Dead Sea Scrolls. The analysis still goes on and the threat to established religions will probably keep their meanings suppressed. A web search for the more recently found, Gospel of Mary and it's analysis is time better spent. The Gospel of Thomas is also worth looking at but to a lesser extent.",1465430400,2,337,4.633333333333334

4981746,1,B006AAD9Q6,"Every part I stepped through is poorly narrated and lacks any real, new, or novel information.  Though I did learn some researchers are learning Photoshop. Wow!  Kind of like the way the Mormon's tried to translate the golden scrolls and many of the team found them to be a simple Egyptian marriage record - but then they vanished.",1461196800,,331,4.689655172413793

4981749,2,B006AAD9Q6,Not impartial. Dated and skips around.,1460419200,,38,5.5
4981750,2,B006AAD9Q6,Very careful not to step on religious toes. Nothing much about the contents of the scrolls and almost nothing about how the Catholic church hogged the scrolls for decades before beginning to reveal them in bits and drabs -- always accompanied by their interpretation of what the text means. There was a non-religious scholar in the original team to examine the scrolls but he was cold-shouldered because of his objectivity. There was nothing about how the Essenes demanded strict observance for life of their food rituals so those who were expelled from the club often died from starvation due their self-imposed restricted diet. Nothing about how members were considered impure after a nocturnal emission of semen. The Essenes at Qumran were rather like Jehovah's Witnesseses: you obeyed every little rule or you were expelled.,1459814400,5,828,5.186567164179104

4981769,5,B006AAD9Q6,I had never read anything in depth of the Dead Sea Scrolls.  I was fascinated with the documentary and amazed of the findings people of the time made and the narrative of the Archeologists.
