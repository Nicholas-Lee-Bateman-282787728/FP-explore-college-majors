1697507,1,B0000640VG,"You must remember that Vietnam is a Communist country that does not allow freedom of speech or freedom of the press. They have always used propaganda to deceive the world and especially the USA during the Vietnam War.

I began studying the Vietnam War in 1979. During the war years the news media was continually creating the image that the USA and the American soldiers serving during the war were nothing but evil.

This message just did not make sense considering the history of our nation, the use of its military and the American soldiers conduct.

I grew up in the 1960s-1970s and was absolutely appalled then and now regarding how our military men were scorned and ridiculed by ""my generation"".

I vividly remember countless arguments with friends and school mates about the men that fought and died in Vietnam. These supposedly ""love children"" from the ""peace loving"" generation were completely clueless, heartless, ignorant and selfish in their actions and words.

Below is some of what I learned from numerous sources; citing facts from American and formerly North Vietnamese politicians and NVA generals that faced our generals on the battlefields of Vietnam.
--------------------------------------------------

You should know that all ""facts"" (not opinions) point to us winning the Vietnam War.  The popular notion that we lost the war is a myth.  The more you tell a lie the more it becomes the truth. We have been beating ourselves up with guilt for over 30 years based upon deception, lies and myths.

When any soldier from any war describes their experience, they are telling their own little view of the war that happens directly to them.  All combat veterans can tell stories of horror and mistakes from any nation's army.  Many of these are not mistakes, but the soldier's perception in his little arena.  The perception of a company's office daily progress would differ from manager and worker.  The soldier and worker in the trenches do not see the big picture because of their limited views. Rumors and myths thrive from this.

The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was created in 1954 to stem further communist takeover of countries in the Pacific region.  SEATO was created as part of the Truman Doctrine to create anti-communist bilateral and collective defense treaties.  These treaties and agreements were intended to create alliances that would contain communist power.  This is why the United States initially became involved in South Vietnam to fight the communist movement under Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam.

Representatives from Australia, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United States, under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, (from which SEATO was formed), pledged to defend against what it saw as an escalation of communist military aggression against democracy.

The Democratic and Republican administrations along with Congress during those years prevented the US military to fight the war as it should have.  Our troops had these ludicrous ""rules of engagement"" and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) had none.  Militarily, our men were severely restrained.  However they still accomplished all objectives and forced North Vietnam to admit defeat and sign the peace agreement.

At that time our government was afraid if we were too aggressive that China would send troops against us, as in Korea.  A little research would have proven this was not going to occur.  China admitted this to be true after the war.  The memories of us decimating them in the Korean War were still fresh in their minds.

North Vietnam knew they could not defeat the US.  They developed one of the world's largest propaganda organizations (Dich Van) to defeat us psychologically.  They successfully divided us by pitting the US population (especially naive college students) against our politicians and soldiers.  The news media played into their hands without researching facts or sources.  The public was ""suckered"" by the repeated disinformation from North Vietnam along with Communist and other dubious sources from within our nation.  For some reason our government was not able or prepared to adequately counter this form of warfare.

The NVA was equally trained as well as the US army.  They also were just as well equipped- supplied from China and Russia.  They actually had better field artillery equipment (Russian).  We had the advantage in air power.  Records reveal the so-called ""Viet Cong"" actually were largely NVA trained, not always the poor farmer that was depicted in the news media.

You can not focus on one company, platoon or squad during battles as the news media did. It is the end result of the total mission that determines success or failure. Due to our strategy and aggressive tactics we were always successful in battle.

By their own estimates we killed 1.2 million of their soldiers-far more than we estimated with the ""evil"" body count.  Can you imagine the length of their war memorial wall?  It became obvious that North Vietnamese men were going to war, never returning and families not notified.  It was later shown that the NVA had a tremendous desertion problem and men doing all possible not to be drafted.  The young men had a saying, ""Born in the North to die in the South"".

There was increasing unrest within North Vietnam because they had no access to the factual progress of the war.  As in all Communist governments, they had no freedom of speech or press and they still do not.

CBS ""60 Minutes"" verified during and after the war, the North Vietnamese government secretly hid the badly wounded soldiers from their families and the public because of the enormous casualty rate.  The amputee soldier was confined to asylums away from the public.  I do not know how long this disturbing policy was in effect.

Throughout the war the North Vietnamese government had a detailed and systematic plan to execute and murder South Vietnamese citizens they deemed as threats.  Also, Ho Chi Minh was absolutely vicious to the people in the North.  R.J. Rummell estimates that from 1957 to 1975 the North Vietnamese government executed around 50,000 North Vietnamese civilians (most were executed by 1960).  Source:  R.J. Rummell (1997). ""Vietnam Democide: Estimates, Sources & Calculations"".

North Vietnam's brutality did not stop at the war's end.  An estimated 95,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the communist ""re-education"" camps, another 500,000 were involved in forced labor projects, which killed 48,000 civilians.  Another 100,000 were executed.  Finally, 400,000 people died while trying to flee Vietnam.  This does not include the unknown fate of thousands of indigent people enslaved for laborious work on the Ho Chi Minh trail throughout the war.

I find it disturbing when everyone (seemingly) rips the USA apart because of the much publicized My Lai Massacre.  Clearly this was committed by a few individuals and not US government and army policy.  Some soldiers refused to participate and some simply walked away.  This came to an end when other US troops protected the civilians and threatened to shoot their fellow soldiers.  We that have never experienced the tremendous stress of war could never imagine committing such an act.  This is not to be used as an excuse.  What these few soldiers did was wrong.  This terrible event amounts to nothing, compared to the planned and premeditated slaughter of civilians, throughout the war by the North Vietnamese government and NVA official policy.

In 1972 Nixon finally gave permission to the air force to conduct military bombing their way.  This should have been done years earlier.

In a matter of days the effect was so devastating that there literally were no more targets left to destroy in NV.  All SAM sites destroyed and their entire missile supply depleted.  The North Vietnamese Army (NVA) did not dare make any movements.  The civilians in Hanoi believed they were defeated, began hanging and waving white flags at U.S. planes.  The NV politicians were so frightened that they quickly contacted the U.S. and signed the peace treaty.

North Vietnam signed the peace treaty January 27, 1973.  The last American troops left South Vietnam March 29, 1973.  Two years later North Vietnam violated the peace treaty, invaded and defeated South Vietnam in 1975.  This had nothing to do with us. The USA was long gone by then.

Regarding the embassy evacuation; this occurred in 1975, more than two years after all of our troops were gone.  The embassy scene was ""the perception of defeat"".  Perceptions do not make truth.  The U.S. only had an embassy in South Vietnam (SV) after the war like any other country.  It was staffed with the normal ""handful"" of Marines.  The news media falsely connected this scene to the loss of the war.  This event occurred more than two years after all of our military was gone and had nothing to do with the war that we had won.

Yes, panicked South Vietnamese wanted to leave, knowing the fate that may await them.  Actually, the NVA were under orders to halt all further advance into Saigon until the evacuation was complete.  They had not forgotten the military might of the U.S. that nearly destroyed them during the war.  They also knew our naval force was close and that the carrier alone had enough power to defeat them.

Our mistake was that we left South Vietnam after we overwhelmingly defeated North Vietnam.  We stayed in Germany, Japan and South Korea.  We left South Vietnam because of public sentiment based upon pseudo information.  Which of these countries are better off?  Which of these governments and countries would you now choose to live in?

Americans always wanted to forget the war and most will never study what actually occurred.

There are a few ""objective"" books written after the war, but I believe ""Unheralded Victory"" by Mark W. Woodruff is easiest to learn what really happened in Vietnam.  This eye opening book was written in 1999.  The book's data and sources come from American and Vietnamese well after the conflict to erase emotions and patriotism.  Alibris.com has used ones available for very little cost.

My guess is that once you read this book, you will be in awe of the veterans' accomplishments, despite having to endure all the restrictions and ill-placed public negativity. Because of what our men in uniform endured from the enemy and the disgraceful attitude at home I consider the Vietnam veterans to be the ""Greatest Generation of Soldiers"".

In general, our nation and veterans have nothing to be ashamed of regarding our participation in the Vietnam War.",1308009600,9,10636,5.048794489092996
1697508,5,B0000640VG,Perfect!! Got here on time. I waited till last minute but it shipped when it said it would. Packing was great!!! On time!! Mint condition like new off shelf!!,1277251200,,158,4.482758620689655
1697509,5,B0000640VG,I was surprised by the images from the Communist POV.  Tim Page was a bonus as the man meeting his Vietnamese counterparts.  The extra with the young woman visiting her parent's homeland and travelling by kayak was also eye-opening.  Vietnam is a country that needs better media representation.,1221436800,4,294,5.083333333333333
1697510,5,B0000640VG,"Excellent DVD investigating photo journalists of the Vietnam War. Tim Page journeys back to Vietnam to talk with the photographers who worked for the ""other side"" during the war. The fact that he is internationally renowned for his own work during the Vietnam War lends credibility to this wonderful National Geographic DVD. The emotion that these photographers display helps viewers understand the dramatic and life changing events these photographers witnessed during their time in Vietnam.

I have used this DVD as part of my Vietnam War History Unit for my Grade 11 Modern History class. The special features are also a must see.

I also recommend this DVD for anyone interested in the contribution of photo journalists during the Vietnam War.",1199836800,6,747,5.1652892561983474
1697511,2,B0000640VG,"I bought this video thinking that it was going to be a documentary showing the war as viewed by the North Vietnamese government, what it actually turned out to be is a photographers autobiography.

It would be more accurately titled ""Tim Page - The War Years"".",1182902400,20,260,4.6521739130434785
1697512,5,B0000640VG,"I just watched this documentary and I was impressed, the quality was outstanding! one of the best war photographer films about the war in VN ever made in my honest opinion.

*1 hour documentary with many never before seen B&W war footage of the Viet cong & NVA very good narration and interviews with actual combat photographers that took these photos over 30 years ago.

*12 picture stills from the book with narration

*bonus 30 minute film called the Decending Dragon about a Vietnamese woman who goes back to VN after 26 years and interviews the people where many of these photos were taken during the war.

*Biography of photographers

total running time is actually about an hour and a half with the bonus documentary

I would highly recommend this DVD and also the companion book titled ""Another Vietnam"" by Tim Page.",1113177600,38,824,4.767605633802817
1697513,4,B0000640VG,"I bought this DVD and enjoyed it very much. It gives clear insight to what the war photo journalists had to do to get their photos & stories to the masses. Interesting stories from both U.S. and Vietnamese war photo journalists. Also, their is a bonus feature of a Vietnamese girl who escaped Vietnam, was raised in the United States, and goes back to see the native country in which she was born. She goes to Hanoi, Central Highlands, and Saigon to talk to some Vietnamese people about what happened during the Vietnam War and how it has affected their lives. Very moving at times. Yes, their are still photos, but they serve to show us the horror of war. Tim Paiges' story is amazing in itself, that he lived to tell what happened to him and how the experience has changed him. Well worth seeing in my opinion.",1111622400,27,812,4.456375838926174

7960103,5,B0000640VG,"The most powerful military power in the world backs France, the former colonial power in Vietnam, then refuses to hold an election that they agreed  to hold to elect a president of Vietnam. This great power uses napalm to destroy the crops of the peasants of the country and conducts massacres against the peasants in the South that it pretended to be protecting. Many years later it was impossible for the country of peasants to grow crops to feed themselves because of the residual effects of the napalm  which poisoned the soil.
This film shows how the Vietnamese peasants lived in caves during the war.
I was lucky to escape this horrible war by joining the Peace Corps, Many of the soldiers from the great power who returned home lived in cardboard boxes in the alleys of cities, had nightmares for years after the war ended and became drug addicts.",1384473600,,854,4.6866666666666665
7960104,5,B0000640VG,"Having read the reviews of others, I know I am not alone in recognizing the passion of those who regard this video to be either reprehensible or courageous in its depiction of the everyday humanity and tragedy of those actively energized and victimized on both sides of this war.  I am one of those who regards this dvd as unparalleled in providing a balanced view of both the humanity and the tragedy of the Viet Nam war.  The humanity of that war lay with the suffering of everyday victims and the sacrifice borne by ""everyday heroes"" (while admittedly trite, the term is warranted in this instance) among both combatants and civilians.  The contest of those leaders to be either blamed or held accountable for that suffering number perhaps in the thousands.  However, those who paid the price in death, life-long despair, and living nightmare number in the millions from each of both sides.  At base, this war was evil, in respect to both actions by those top-level decision makers who championed it and others who opposed it. Throughout history, tribalisms, nationalisms, religions, and other ideologies --- secular and religious --- have imposed their own polarities of angelic virtue and satanic evil in legitimating and perpetrating their respective horrors .  This video deserves to be celebrated for its humanity, and also for its balance in focusing on the photographers who documented the everyday heroism, tragedy and humanity of the millions who sought to defend themselves, their loved ones, and their nations --- and also in conveying the democracy of tragedy that unites the community of participants from both sides.  Saddest of all in this documentary is the extent to which it conveys the shared tragedy of decent human beings, all of them struggling for survival, and each seeking to defend themselves, their loved ones, and their nations against their satanic adversaries, who happen to be other decent human beings --- a perverse realization of Thomas Hobbes's notion of A War of All Against All.  All too human.  All too sad.  Noel Byrne",1384128000,,2060,5.0146627565982405
