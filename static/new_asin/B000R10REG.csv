8198284,5,B000R10REG,"Although I would have liked to have the entire series released by season, I know that many of these films are no longer available, or have been damaged beyond repair.  I am thankful that Nostalgia Merchant has given us 32 great episodes of this classic!

I have this set from Nostalgia Merchant and am very happy with the quality.  Although not digital quality, I consider the quality to be good for these very old episodes.",1250121600,7,424,4.626666666666667

8198286,4,B000R10REG,"I bought this as a Christmas gift to my Dad.  He was so excited to get home and watch these.  He said it is exactly as he remembers it.

I was named after the daughter on this series and had always wondered why.  He always told me that he thought she was a cute little girl.  I must say, I have to agree.

The set came in plenty of time for Christmas although I placed my order only a couple of weeks before Christmas.

My Dad and I are both delighted by this find.",1231718400,8,465,3.882978723404255

8198288,5,B000R10REG,"I have really enjoyed this DVD collection of ""The Life Of Riley"" (TLOR) episodes. This collection is truly a ""blast from the past"" and brings back fond memories of very entertaining, laugh out loud TV comedy. Unlike so many TV ""sitcoms"" of the TLOR time period TLOR is well written, very well acted, directed and produced and could easily fit in today as an entertaining ""slice of life"" period piece. Riley is a believable character who is part of the Southern California aerospace culture and although Cunningham Aircraft, Riley's employer, is fictional, places and events mentioned in the show like the Riley's hometown, El Segundo, and surrounding cities such as Glendale, Burbank on so forth give the show a sense of historical reality. Plus, in exterior shots you will see period history such as the back yard incinerators used to burn household trash and compliment the LA smog!!

TLOR is about a middle class family with both parents still married and supportive of each other. Peg, the Mother, is a stay at home Mom raising the Riley's two children Jr. and Babs and manages the Riley household. The two children contribute to the family, respect their parents and each other. Despite Chester A. Riley not always making the right decisions he always gets the love and support of his ""TV"" family. Of course, the Riley's neighbors and good friends Gillis and Honeybee add to the show's comic antics.

It is apparent that the collection's DVDs are produced from either direct film or video tape transfers and neither video nor audio appear to have been digitally re-mastered. Despite a very few episodes having an old unrestored film look around the edges the majority of the episodes look extremely well. The audio is good in all episodes. The episodes do appear to be random selections from the various seasons and do jump around chronologically on each disc, e.g., a single disc may have episodes from several different seasons and randomly ordered. But, this is a minor issue for true LTOR fans. I would have preferred that the NostalgiaMerchant not display their Logo from time to time during several of the episodes.

A couple of the earliest episodes have a different actress playing Honeybee and in the later seasons Gillis and Honeybee are replaced by what seems to be a washed up, hack Catskills type comedian full of the quick and biting insults one expects from today's TV sitcoms and complimented by his long suffering wife. Despite the Catskills ""schtick"" William Bendix keeps center stage through these episodes and seems to have single handedly pioneered the ""deadpan"" straight on look at the camera. In the later seasons you do get to see a young Martin Milner dating and finally marrying Babs Riley. And don't forget Sterling Holloway who plays Riley's other friend and neighbor Waldo Benny.

If you remember TLOR and enjoyed it back in the 50s you will enjoy the show just as much today. I have been disappointed in many of the old TV sitcoms and ended up wondering what I ever found to be entertaining when I watched them back in the 50s and 60s. This is not the case for me with TLOR. I can honestly say that this is one of the old TV sitcoms that has gotten better with age.

Although not a complete collection of all TLOR episodes, I highly recommend this collection for any TLOR fan.

Enjoy!!",1202169600,38,3320,4.795454545454546
8198289,5,B000R10REG,"The five stars are for William Bendix and his GREAT portrayal of Riley . I love this show and will purchase it as soon as I find out what the quality of the picture is . It appears that this is a DVD made up of shows from several or all of the seasons and not a continuous season . It could be that full seasons are not available any longer because of episodes being lost, as many greats were . To bad if so . I wish the Seller would be more consise in their description and tell us if this is all they have or will ever have . Also they could tell us what the quality of the picture is  . Many would probably purchase it anyway . I have purchased other old shows and although the picture wasn't like I would like it, and who can complain as this is 50 or more years old, a show like this comes along only once in a life time . I want all of them if they are ever offered . The Nostalgia Merchant has a web site of their own but these episodes are offered as 4 per dvd and not as as a set . At $8.00 per dvd it would cost $64 for all plus shipping . This is a good price here .",1196294400,25,1077,3.703056768558952
