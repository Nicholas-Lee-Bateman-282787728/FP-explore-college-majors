8098748,5,B000CFGF0M,Love the Red Phoenix firebird in this classic anime series. Only 13 eps but great nonetheless.,1492214400,,94,4.9375
8098749,5,B000CFGF0M,"Great purchase! Arrived in timely manner, video quality great and I was overall happy with my purchase. I would order again from this seller.",1273795200,,141,4.916666666666667
8098750,4,B000CFGF0M,"I got this as a gift quite a while ago, asking simply for the Descendants Of Darkness Box Set, and a relative not knowing any better got me this.

At first I was upset (naturally I hid my disappointment), but after I started watching it I was actually quite happy - the video/audio quality is spot on, and perhaps the BEST thing is that Disc One has 7 episodes, and Disc Two has six - so you don't have to switch discs every three episodes.

Although this title is no longer contracted by any American anime company, you'll still have to buy this at a website that sells Asian Imports (the best sites offer titles that exist only in Japan - aka NOT bootlegs). And as this is no longer sold New in the U.S., the bootleg is your only option (unless you've got $75 - $100 to spend on Used individual  discs or the Used boxset). So all I can really say is although I wish I had gotten the 4-disc boxset, I'm still happy with the two-disc one (I checked around and it goes for between $15 and $17).

You'll have to search for a site on your own though, for although I don't have anything against bootleg sets (for titles that are no longer in print or titles that are greedily over-priced (you know some of the ones I'm talking about!)), I'm not going to ENABLE the purchasing of bootlegs -

And remember - some bootleg anime boxsets cost the same, or even MORE, than a used American copy of the same title: so buy American whenever possible. Not just from a moral standpoint, but because as the years go by and old anime titles become valuable, bootleg copies will quite probably never be worth much of anything.",1244851200,,1608,4.32890365448505
