Well, ""Elmore Leonard's Criminal Record,"" a 1993 BBC documentary shows us the man behind the curtain.  Over a dozen of Leonard's novels have made it to the silver screen and if you wondered why his books seems so adaptable the answer is that the author researches his characters by watching videotaped interviews with cops, judges, bail bondsmen and the like.  You also get the bonus of Leonard reading from ""Killshot"" and other favorites.  This is one of the few documentaries on a contemporary writer that actually gives you some insights.  But please remember: you are still required to read the man's books, not just see the movies.",986256000,11,809,4.875912408759124
