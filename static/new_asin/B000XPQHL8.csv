8228930,3,B000XPQHL8,Keaton was never less than great. But the dvd did not have eirher subtitles for the dialogue nor English dub option.,1467417600,,116,4.571428571428571
8228931,3,B000XPQHL8,"Entertaining.  I got it because I am a huge Buster Keaton fan, and I enjoyed his performance in spite of not understanding a word of Italian.  However, as a film it's not so good.  The word ""cute"" comes to mind.",1427068800,,211,4.225
8228932,3,B000XPQHL8,"This movie was released in the United States as ""War--Italian Style"" in the late 1960's.  This is a lowbrow comedy from Italy with Italian actors in the lead and a supporting cast of Americans,  (Buster Keaton, Martha Hyer and Fred Clark) who all sound a bit odd dubbed in Italian since I am familiar with the voices they should have. It's my own darn fault for not reading more carefully, but I thought I read ""English subtitles"" where it says Italian subtitles so the viewer is left on his own if he speaks no Italian (I don't). There aren't any subtitle dialogue or plot nuances to miss so I think I managed to follow almost all of the movie even with that limitation.  I first knew Keaton's work from the ""Beach Party"" movies and thought he was very, very funny. I am in full agreement with those of you who think his best work was NOT in those movies,  but I was a kid at the time!  I have wanted to see this movie ever since that period. Well, a 40 year wait was a bit too much, but it was amusing in spots and worth seeing for Keaton and Hyer.  I already owned a Region 2 player (it won't play on an Region 1, American player), but have to admit I am not sure this obscure movie was worth $20 dollars and the 3 week wait for shipment. I'm glad I saw it once but don't know how often I will watch it again.  Worth having for Keaton fans attempting to get a complete collection, for all others, I would say, not worth it in this format.",1296864000,,1441,4.161870503597123
