8525540,5,B0085EBKRU,"A very inspiring story, and this delves into the human aspects of Rick Hansen...as well as those of the people who supported him.

The ending is a little anti-climactic...I won't ruin that, but it should have been done differently.  That said, it is still a must-see movie.

Also wish they would have used the original John Parr version of St. Elmo's Fire.

Nonetheless, a very good movie.  Rick Hansen has been a source of inspiration for me ever since my own diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes.  He proved that a paraplegic could accomplish big things, and I believe that Type 2 Diabetes does not stop ME from doing big things, either.",1444694400,,633,4.657657657657658

8525543,4,B0085EBKRU,"Honestly I really liked the movie, like Victor Webster in just about everything but there was something missing with this or I would have given it 5 stars. Victor was amazing in the role and all the actors were really pretty good; I mean it wasn't a masterpiece that will go down in history like Gone With the Wind or anything but it was beautiful and moving, the story was inspiring but it seemed like this could have been a longer movie or maybe it was and was edited to death because it was just.....I don't know it just seemed like something was missing. You watch and make the call yourself but I think it was worth the rental and if you are a fan of Victor Webster (MutantX, Continuum) then it's DEFINITELY worth it, he always delivers :)",1406851200,3,744,4.359712230215828

8525547,4,B0085EBKRU,"Let's be frank - like many of the people who will buy or watch this I'm a fan of Andrew Lee Potts and bought the dvd on the strength of that, having never heard of Rick Hansen way down here at the other end of the planet. The first time I watched this I came out the other end feeling very confused. I then watched the ""making of"" which gave me a good insight into the director's vision and having just watched it a 2nd time I enjoyed it more.

Basically if you go into this expecting a typical story progression - beginning/middle/end - then you'll be left wanting. I want to call this mockumentary, only with nothing mocking in its tone..... Perhaps ""dramatisation of a true story"" is better, but as I said this isn't a whole story. The viewer is dropped into the midst of a little dysfunctional family who are already a long way into their journey, and the film covers only a few days of their lives. It's quickly apparent how very far away from home this little group is, and how dependent they are on each other without necessarily liking one another very much. By this stage of the epic journey everyone is very tired, tempers are fraying, and Rick Hansen is so excessively driven and so buried in himself that he is often cruel to his supporters. One member of the team has already quit and it seems entirely possible that the whole venture is about to collapse. Then an unsympathetic reporter arrives and asks questions that provoke even more irritability as he tries to understand what drives the Man in Motion and why his small crew have given up their own lives for the sake of Hansen's vision.
As the film reaches its centre piece and everyone is pushed beyond their limits emotional walls come down and a new level of understanding and compassion is reached between Hansen and his crew, and the reporter, watching but not involved, gets his story.

The real star of the movie is China, beautifully shot in a minimalist style by what seems to have been a largely Chinese crew. This minimalism also drove the script, and this is what I struggle with. We learn very little about the past lives of any of the characters, and given that we meet them at a point when they are all exhausted and irritable it is hard to know who they really are as people. For me Hansen is just not very likeable - admirable, certainly, but so single minded as to seem uncaring of those around him. Lee, the clown, is an enigma- we learn very little about him. Andrew Lee Potts plays alongside his real life sister Sarah Jane, and the exchanges between these two are for me the most genuine, affectionate and insightful moments of the movie.

I respect the minimalist style that has been used in telling this story, but I'm not sure that I'm comfortable with it. The almost total lack of context forced me to go and research for myself in order to gain just a little understanding of what this trip was for and who these people were. Maybe that's my failure rather than the film makers', maybe Hansen is much more well known in the northern hemisphere than the southern? I don't know. I feel like I want to pick this movie up and shake it till it reveals its secrets to me! Probably what I'll actually do is watch it a bunch more times, because its not going to leave my head otherwise, and I'm intrigued by it. Not a bad outcome I suppose - better to be left wanting more than to know that every angle has been tied up neatly in 90 minutes and that there are no more stories to tell.",1359158400,3,3472,4.396578538102644
8525548,3,B0085EBKRU,"When I purchased Heart of a Dragon, I'd been waiting a while for its release. I have to admit that I was a bit confused by the director's vision for the story. The cinematography was magnificent. There was conflict between the characters, a little comedic relief, and Andrew-Lee Potts, as always, shined in the movie as did Sarah Jane Potts. So, would I recommend the movie...yes. This is a story about challenges, and it doesn't hide behind the ""heroic"" efforts of an individual. The individual plainly does what he does for pride. The screenplay could have been better if it focused on the physical conflict a little more, but the emotional and the personal conflict of the characters does work. So, yes, buy and enjoy.",1348617600,2,721,4.776
