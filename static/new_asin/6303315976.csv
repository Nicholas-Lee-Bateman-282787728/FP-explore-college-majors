I finally found this here and had to make the purchase. Although it is VHS, it is a wonderful cross-Canadian journey and every time I watch it, it fuels my fire to make the trip myself. It is a wonderful video. The only negative is that this is not available on dvd. If you have ever wanted to experience Canada and that by train, this is the video for you! The author shares a journey in a wonderful experience. This is not a video on building trains or a history of trains per se, but it is an adventure in time on a train that went across Canada from west to east and versa vice. For the price, I don't think you would regret it!
I did not receive this item free but purchased it because I had loved it and remembered it from the first time I saw it! I was delighted to find it here!~",1489104000,,910,4.0054945054945055
