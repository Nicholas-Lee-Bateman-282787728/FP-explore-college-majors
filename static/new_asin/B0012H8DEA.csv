8245952,5,B0012H8DEA,"What an oddity of the instructional video genre.  As it presents itself, it details the dangers of almost any object that hones down to a thin line, ranging from your traditionally menacing machetes to the McGuyver'd glasses that fits any sharp outfit.  The dialogue is straight to the point, but the cinematography throws a curveball and some shuriken your way.  You'll be mesmerized by the effort put into its reenactment segments with heartily laughs at the sheer insanity of each situation just before the video catches you off-guard with the reality that inspired each scene.  It's a diamond in the rough of instructional media, and deserves a thorough watch in good company (barring that none of you have any qualms AND edgy objects nearby).  Highly recommended for its instructional value and production.",1521590400,,811,5.113636363636363
8245953,5,B0012H8DEA,"I was stabbed by a VHS tape. It had been sharpened for hours by hand by an elderly wheelchair-bound madman. I'd been out doing a housecall to repair a furnace which had been clogged with pizza rolls. While I was inspecting the unit, I heard muffled screams and investigated the cellar to find  a bevy of hog-tied hookers. While my back was turned, the creepy owner shanked me right in the left calf, but I managed to fend him off with my fountain pen and crawl to freedom. And it was all thanks to the education this video provided.",1512432000,18,532,4.373737373737374

RedLetterMedia approved it for viewing, so be assured that you will get your money's worth. 5 out of 5 Rich Evans.",1512345600,22,252,4.883720930232558
