2394575,2,B000AUMH38,I thought this kind of stupid and juvenile.  Didn't finish watching it too boring.,1273104000,,82,4.857142857142857
2394576,1,B000AUMH38,"This is a very low budget play/film. It is done by five high school age kids with (I'm guessing) very little stage experience. I was just barely able to suffer through it when the message began to get whacky...like some kind of religious cult. I am a Christian and have purchased over 100 Christian films and have enjoyed the biggest share of them, excluding ""My Turn on Earth"" which is neither Christian nor entertaining.",1247270400,,422,4.716216216216216

2394578,4,B000AUMH38,This lighthearted musical is pleasant and enjoyable and nicely produced.  It has a lot of family appeal and would be nice for holiday viewing.,1165449600,4,142,4.916666666666667
2394579,3,B000AUMH38,I feel the depth and detail of a great message was lost by the fast pace of the delivery. I had to watch it several times to catch all the details. The actual live play I saw had slowed the action down enough so the the beautiful message could be better followed and communicated.,1395187200,,280,4.203703703703703
2394580,3,B000AUMH38,"Quality of product was excellent.  But was disappointed in the stage play.  My imagination while listening to the sound tract was more artistic.  Also, I noticed that one of my favorite songs from the sound tract ""Family Night"" was missing from the Original Stage Musical.
I bought a second copy  to send to my grandchildren but I will not send it now.  While they will enjoy the songs, the stage play is not geared for children under the age of ten.",1392681600,,450,4.506172839506172
2394581,5,B000AUMH38,"As indicated in the subtitle, this movie was created by filming a production of the original play. The actors, music and direction are excellent and true to any version of the play that you might view if you have the chance to see it in person. The subject matter is clearly defined as true to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), but even if you are not a Mormon, it would still be well worth watching simply because the actors are clearly enjoying themselves. Don't sell it short if you are debating your purchase. And if you are a member of the church and haven't had the chance to see the play, you will find yourself completely immersed in a totally marvelous experience. A great movie for the entire family. Enjoy!",1385510400,,746,4.492647058823529
2394582,1,B000AUMH38,"This product was not what i expected. I wanted this in DVD format, it is what I was led to believe i was ordering, How ever when i received it in the mail it was in VHS (I don't have anything to play VHS) when i looked at the order form it states that I had ordered it VHS. I know when i placed the order it was for DVD, In fact I spent a grate deal of time looking for the play in DVD format.",1378684800,,393,3.5813953488372094
2394583,5,B000AUMH38,"This is a fun family musical, I bought it to use in teaching a Sunday School class.
It would also be great for teaching your children about the importance of family.",1374278400,,165,4.354838709677419
2394584,5,B000AUMH38,"I am no LDS, and I still loved, loved, loved this play/songs. When my children were little we listened and sang the songs. And we discussed the songs because there is such great lessons in them! And to this day my children still remember these songs!  Yes I realized that the songs were LDS themed, but the songs that I concentrated on the most were 'Choosing' and 'The Golden Rule', however we listened and sang All of them!! Regardless of what religion you are, or even if you are an atheist! those two songs -Choosing' and 'The Golden Rule'- teach principles that children must learn!!",1370649600,3,588,4.6
2394585,5,B000AUMH38,"Ultra rare, took me forever to find this.  No LDS performance has so perfectly captured the entire scope of the Gospel plan.  Utterly spectacular and breathtaking in its depth, scope, and spirit.  I hope the church returns to performances such as these, they are sorely missed.",1365379200,,277,4.978260869565218
2394586,5,B000AUMH38,"I grew up with this sound track when I was really young.  I am now 30 and have a son of my own that I want to share this with.  It is one of those uplifting things in this world that we need more of.  It is LDS themed and it does explain in song Heavenly Father's plan for each one of us his children.  I love it the most because whenever I've needed something to sing to myself to lift my spirit and be family friendly, I revert back to the songs of this sound track.  I've even sung some of these songs to my son to help him fall asleep to at night.",1360368000,,551,3.756521739130435
2394587,5,B000AUMH38,Loved this DVD. I have enjoyed listening to the soundtrack so it was wonderful watching it come to life! The video and audio were clear. Amd I received the DVD two days after I ordered it.,1356739200,,188,4.25
2394588,5,B000AUMH38,I have had a copy of this item for about 20 yrs.  The music is so wonderful I got another copy to give to a special friend .  The music tells the story of mortal life.  It is fun to sing along.  It has an LDS theme,1291420800,3,214,3.4893617021276597

8079866,5,B000AUMH38,"absolute fantasy and beautiful musical and an  exciting version of where we came from, why we are here on earth and where we go when we die.  I am LDS and this is an LDS movie so to me it was a very logical and a good teaching movie.",1446508800,,233,3.7346938775510203
