7903011,2,B000003KJD,"The Mens Club,"" directed by Peter Medak (The Ruling Class), is based on the novel of the same name by Leonard Michaels. Meeting at the Berkeley home of Kramer (Richard Jordan, The Mean Season), a psychotherapist with shaky credentials, several men of various ages and backgrounds assemble in support group-like sessions where they share their innermost fears, regrets, and desires. On one key evening, tensions will flare and deep-seated hostilities will emerge, culminating in shocking revelations.

Cavanaugh (Roy Scheider) is a former Major League baseball player who has anger issues toward women, Solly Berliner (Harvey Keitel) is a high-powered real estate businessman, and Phillip (David Dukes) is a pretty wholesome family man and professor. Terry (Treat Williams) is a hedonistic doctor, Harold Canterbury (Frank Langella) is an attorney with a sexual fetish, and Paul (Craig Wasson) is content to smoke a joint and just listen to the others.

Each of the men takes a turn complaining about what bothers him in their group gripe session. The actors hold our attention by very good performances but, as the film goes on, it gets weirder and even surreal as the action splinters in assorted directions, and central focus is lost. Cavanaugh has a threesome with two women half his age, Solly is obsessed with French kissing, Harold makes love to a woman while she paints his face in a Kabuki-like look, and Terry beats a woman for taking food from his plate.

The film is more like a stage play with its abundance of dialogue, limited changes of location, and general claustrophobic feel. As the yuppie types deliver monologues about how difficult their lives are, they become increasingly annoying and seem more like chronic cry babies than grown men. The quality of the performances makes it seem as if the film is profound as it delves into the rather shallow lives of these guys. The concept of people opening up to one another in a confined setting worked in John Hughes The Breakfast Club with teenagers as the main characters, but seems contrived and overly theatrical in The Mens Club.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release. The film is rated R.",1485216000,,2184,5.008264462809917

7903013,5,B000003KJD,"The short attention span of modern viewers possibly precludes them from appreciating the art of story-telling, an art that is richly represented in the first portion of this movie.  Not many films have a collection of short, eloquently-told tales, but this one gives us that treat in fine form.  The upshot of the stories is the complaints the men have about the various abuses or indignities they have suffered at the hands of women they have attempted to love.  The bull session concludes with rowdiness and the host's being physically abused by his wife with a frying pan, after which he calmly explains that she's really unhappy now and they'd best go home, as the blood runs down his face.  The men adjourn for ""breakfast"" at a high-dollar brothel.  The irony is how these men, after complaining about all the problems attached to seeking feminine company, now can only complain when faced with women who are totally compliant.  One says he has to ""get to know"" a woman before having sex, and another fancies that he wants to wed one of the girls after knowing her for a few minutes and becomes incensed when told a relationship is not possible.",1400630400,6,1150,4.725
7903014,2,B000003KJD,"I recently watched this old 80s heavy hitter with the all-star cast (Roy Scheider, David Dukes, Richard Jordan, Stockard Channing, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Harvey Keitel, Treat Williams and more).  This major production kind of withered on the vine and I don't think it was ever even transferred to DVD (VHS only).

The story is of a group of successful Berkley, CA professional guys that get together for their initial ""club"" meeting.  There is a bit of somewhat interesting personal revelation/introspection, then the alcohol starts flowing and the action progresses to a stupid over-the-top scene of them all howling at the moon, coyote style.  At this point the wife (Stockard Channing) comes home and sees that the house is severely trashed and the carefully prepared refreshments for her women's club meeting on the morrow have been ravaged.  I don't care for Channing, but in this case I really felt sympathy for her character.  No slack from the director however, as she is turned into a co-bad guy (more of my take on the women's issues below).

The action then relocates to a surprise visit to a high-end brothel.  The use of women in this film is another topic.  They are so much chattel.  I'm not ""enlightened"", liberal, or anything near it - but it was apparent that this film consistently trashes women (and by reflection, trashes the men that abuse them).

I'm not sure what deep or intellectual message the filmmakers tried to get across.  These characters (women included) underwent frequent inexplicable personality changes.  You can't really credit the alcohol, because no one really acted drunk.  Just the senseless over-the-top mood shifts and subsequent over-intellectual speeches (exception: Penny Baker who as a prostitute is overtly stupid - and is of course mocked for it as a ""beautiful stupid blond"" cliche).  If there are really people like this, I'm glad I haven't been hanging out with them.

Production values were pretty good.  This was not a low-budget project.  Foul language - yes, nudity/sex - yes, violence - yes (fights, gunfire, etc).

This failure's closing scene was this dopey upbeat shot of these ""happy buddies"" jogging back over the Bay Bridge at sunrise.  Be assured, there is nothing upbeat about this film.  It is depressing and crude.  After finishing it, I felt like I needed a shower.",1175990400,4,2333,5.020833333333333
7903015,2,B000003KJD,"Director Peter Medak's adaptation of the Leonard Michaels novel hovers midway between an all male confessional and a testosterone-soaked bull session, and perhaps it's this nebulous stance that has disappointed so many. Michaels also did the screenplay, though it is said that the visit to a brothel - The House of Affection- which comprises the second half is new. The plot centres on a group of 7 men in San Francisco, in various stages of marriage, meeting. We don't expect consciousness-raising, as we would of women, since men don't tend to be as insightful, simply the telling of stories. It's tribal, culminating in a group howling to the moon, but not barbaric in spite of the drinking and pot. We do get the de rigueur anti-gay joke but it passes relatively painlessly. Medak may include the raiding of a frig, full for a wife's next day women's club meeting, and knife throwing, but these men are still presented as reasonable and intelligent. Their hang-dog reaction to the appearance of Stockard Channing as the wife tells us that. The anecdotes we hear are free of malice, which makes the sojourn to the brothel the more interesting, since what expires is more than just about getting laid. It's more practice after the meeting's theory. The men talk of their hunger for ""The Other Woman"", cleverly realised by the concept of the prostitutes, whose seeming disempowerment gives way once the lovemaking is over. The climactic faux wedding scene and conclusion may be hard to read and have elements of fantasy eg the brothel being so exclusive that is has no other clients, but it also highlights the need for simple pleasures that can ease the battle of the sexes. It's unusual to see a male ensemble, and in a large group naturally some performers emerge as stronger than others, unless the material is like the film of the play That Champion Season, where the writer gives each character an aria. Here, Craig Wasson in particular is wallpaper, though he has an amusing resistance to his seductress, and Frank Langella has just as little, though he gets to look bacchanalian in Devil makeup. Treat Williams delivers a speech about a former girlfriend who gets between his food and his mouth, Richard Jordan as the houseguest is goofy bleeding from the head after Channing hits him with a frypan, and Harvey Keitel reveals a sentimental soul under a stud exterior. Keitel is responsible for the brothel wedding and is the actor most exposed as an object. It's hard to believe Roy Scheider as a great womaniser, in spite of the scene where he mounts his unconscious wife. He's more surprising when he dances to a jazz version of When the Saints Come Marching In. However the film inexplicably belongs to David Dukes, an actor who otherwise has been annoyingly mannered and lightweight. Here he is a revelation. The women make less of an impression, even with Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the prostitutes. Ann Wedgeworth's madam carrying a doll gets a payoff, and I was actually sorry not to see more made of her anaylsis of Scheider, particularly as they circle each other near the end.",1002672000,5,3099,4.827067669172933
