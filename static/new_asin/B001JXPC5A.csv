3660007,4,B001JXPC5A,"First off, I love Kimberly Mullen's Brazilian Body & Abs Burn dvds. She has great body awareness, positive, energetic, friendly, motivating & a cheerful voice. Her cuing even though it's voice over, tends to be late, and though great at encouraging & sometimes great at telling you where to focus, could have more explanation of more complex moves. In those I was able to get though them fairly easily without more explanation. Her Brazillian was perfect & her Abs Burn while a little repetitious, wasn't so bad I got annoyed because I kept feeling the flexibility & body awareness effects every time, as well as the muscle use. Her warm-up & cool downs are top notch, I always feel they flow perfectly for body balance of muscles as well as almost a very short easy/moderate workout in & of themselves.
This contains a 5 min warm-up, a 20 min slower Heavenly Hips, a 20 min faster pace Lovely Legs & a 5 min cool down. Bonus includes 10 min from her Brazilian Body & 8 min from ""Dance & be fit Latin Groove.
Warm-up 5 min.
As said, the warm-up isn't just breathing or mild stretches, but has you seated wide angle stretches, going back/forth between seated facing one side with one leg in front, one leg back, changing legs to wide open, then facing the other side. Pigeon stretch to one side, seated single leg stretch, pigeon on the other, repeat in a fast pace. Seated leg swings, a seated crossed leg pose straight to downward dog. Cross legs one side, seated with legs split in air, the legs crossed on other side, repeat, etc. Runner's lunge, pyramid pose, standing split in a single flow as well.
Heavenly Hips 20 min.
Raising to toes balance, standing single leg balance on one side to body rolls to single leg on other flow. Hip bumps to pointing single leg out back/forth, single leg hip circles w/walking in a circle, also adding body roll/standing fwd bend in the middle. Travel step of wide circle arms & steping to side w/pose & that's about it. It seems to be more focused on balance, flexibiity, body awareness, grace & letting go & having fun. This wouldn't make anyone sweat,, but it's cute, though it repeats so much, it could have been 1/2 the time.
Lovely Legs 20 min
She starts off as saying, ""We're going to pick up the pace a little here..."" Very wide & deep squats/stretch, leaning most weight on one side w/bent knee, the other side after a while goes deeper/straight for deeper stretch with flat back always, flowing to runner's lunge, back/forth many times & at the end adds a single leg standing balance to runner's lunge, horse stance w/shoulder presses (leaning alternate shoulder fwd), w/on tip toes, w/flat back & plies. Then to knee lifts fwd that turn to slight bent high kicks & straight leg high kicks with jazz steps (step fwd front/back & almost cha-cha in between the kicks for better flow.  Stepping diagonally w/straight & bent arms to get more spine stretching with cha-cha in between sometimes, then she adds body rolls to the sides as well. Back to fwd kicks, then back to diagonal stepping & body rolls. Next is sweeping straight arms around to rest purposely on one hip w/foot crossed behind like a bullfighter? flamanco? paso doble? dancer. She will later add grand plies in between & even a grand plie slow turn many times. Next is side kicks, with simple jazz steps in between so it's not stiff/static. Repeat pose/grand plie flow to add back attitude kicks (kick behind very high w/arms outstretched back). Repeat all the other routines/flows since the beginning.
Cool down 5 min
Here, Kimberly adds more Lester Horton dance moves/stretches that really help spine flexibility & arm positions. She has done some in the Lovely legs w/the back flat positions, etc., but not much & does more here which feels great. It's mostly side stretches. Next is standing fwd bends, plank on elbows, child's pose flowing into kneeling slight back bend, cat/cow stretch w/great body roll/hip roll.

Ok, she says, ""Feel the burn, love the burn"" way too much in the two workouts. It reminds me too much of, ""No pain, no gain."" It just makes one feel like they are mindless burning calories so they can eat another desert without gaining weight. If it weren't for the repetitiveness & the cuing so late it was almost worthless (though the cheeriness & encouraging words help), this would be a great workout.
This would be best for beginners, or light days for intermediates who want to work on balance/body awareness, flowing very simple jazz/modern dance movements, easy pace cardio, balance & more dancer kicks.

3660008,5,B001JXPC5A,"She has done it again, I fell in love with her Brazilian Body workout.
The variety in this workout was great, I worked up a moderate sweat. I really felt the burn and felt it over my whole body. Her cueing was alittle off but well worth the effort. I almost died doing the leg work.
You must just keep working at it. I'd much rather do her dvd's then kill myself at any gym. Her energy and motivation keeps you going, there is a sex appeal and body form that is so inspiring. It makes you want to master the techniques. Many of the exercises were hard for me to complete, however in time I am sure I will get better at it. After my first session I can already feel it's effects on my flexiblity, and indurance. Loved it, Love it. Keep it coming Kim. Thank you.",1244937600,,760,4.10738255033557
3660009,1,B001JXPC5A,"Boring choreography, poor cuing, annoying voice! I am constantly searching for workouts that trim my lower body without bulking it up and thought I had finally found one with Lower Body Burn. Not at all! Unless you are an extreme beginner, this hardly counts as a workout. My heart rate never went up, the choreography is tedious, and the voice of the instructor is whiny and unpleasant. The ""Heavenly Hips"" section is just a vast amount of hip shaking and swiveling - it is not designed to actually impact one's hips. The leg section is poorly cued and dull. I have finally learned to never purchase another workout dvd produced by Acacia or Gaiam.",1244678400,2,649,4.701754385964913
3660010,3,B001JXPC5A,"Nice smile, nice voice, she is very sympathetic but I wouldn't say I felt the burn. It is a nice exercice but not more than that.",1244332800,2,129,4.0
3660011,2,B001JXPC5A,"Let me say first I liked Kimberly's Brazilian workout and I read all the great reviews of this DVD and was pretty excited to buy it, but I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. First of all, the cuing on the warmup is very poor. Cuing isn't her strength, but I shouldn't be frustrated during the warming up stretches and I was. Then the heavenly hips section is very monotonous and doesn't raise your heart rate for the first 15 minutes. This section may be good for someone who is new to working out and wants to ease into it, but half of the section you are just swinging your hips from side to side. It's not strenuous enough to be used for a toning workout either. During the second section the pace is picked up. That's where the cuing falls apart a bit again. There's one move she does that she says isn't a kick, but because of the camera angle you really can't see what she's doing. Overall I didn't like the workout and I would reccomend that people get her Brazilian workout instead. Other options also include Ballet Conditioning with Elise Gulan, and Exhale's total body workout for toning or Kari Anderson's Reach for dance based toning workouts. For cardio, try World Dance New York's Samba Reggae workouts with Quenia Rivera.",1241568000,9,1244,4.558035714285714
3660012,5,B001JXPC5A,"This workout is so much fun!  My friends and I have been gathering together to do this dvd and then go for a short run through the park...seriously, if you want great legs for summer pick this video up!",1240012800,2,202,4.17948717948718
3660013,5,B001JXPC5A,"I loved her Brazilian Body and I love Lower Body Burn! In this DVD, Kimberly applies fundamental dance techniques that give you a great foundation to apply to all dance forms. This dvd has helped achieve better balance, stronger legs, defined thighs, and gluts. I can't wait to get her Abs burn. Keep it up Kimberly!",1237161600,2,316,4.660714285714286
3660014,5,B001JXPC5A,"Kimberly Miguel Mullen's Lower Body Burn has saved my life! I have had so many problems getting rid of my stubborn trouble spots on my thighs. I've been doing her dvd 3 times a week for three weeks and I'm already seeing results. Now that summer is around the corner, I plan on sticking to this workout and am eyeing new shorts for the season!",1237075200,4,343,4.292307692307692
3660015,5,B001JXPC5A,"Ms. Kimberly Miguel Mullen does it again with Lower Body Burn. I'm very familiar with this workout and recommend it to anyone who likes to work hard and have fun. I break a mean sweat every time and feel like it works the targeted areas well. The DVD is also beautifully shot and the vibe of the music keeps you relaxed. Great work, Kimmi.",1232409600,,339,4.3125
3660016,5,B001JXPC5A,"I'm the type of person who doesn't leave comments or write reviews unless I really believe in the product or person or service provided, etc.. I wrote a review in Kimberly's 'Brazilian Body' for this very reason--I think she offers a very positive service and energy and skill level to anyone who views her videos and at a great price! Positivity and good energy is needed today. I support those who practice it and offer it to others.
This much said, my girlfriend has received Kim's latest video, to go along with the 'Brazilian Body' video, and she LOVES this one as well!!! Try getting a personal trainer or taking classes at night, after work, when it's cold and dark (in some parts of the country, anyway) and you've got a million other things to do.... Those things take a lot of the key resources: Time and Money. With these videos, you can get great sweat and cardio and stretching done in your own home. Do this workout once per day and you'll be enjoying the benefits and feeling a LOT better within a week. You can't rewind a trainer to go back or pause at something you didn't catch but you can do that with these DVD's. Very easy to follow and very beneficial to your quality of life--anyone can do it! Thanks again, Kim, and keep up the EXCELLENT WORK!",1231891200,2,1267,4.4655172413793105

8313846,3,B001JXPC5A,"I purchased this dvd because I enjoyed Kimberly Miguel Mullen's other Dance and Be Fit workout the Brazilian Dance Workout.  I am very disappointed.  Kimberly's cueing is horrible throughout the workout.  It is very frustrating and prevents you from either relaxing or having fun.  The first dance sequence is very monotonous, repetitive and will not get your heart rate elevated.  This section may be good for somebody returning to fitness after a major injury or who is an absolute begginer to working out. The second dance routine had more promise as being more up beat and having a little more challenging moves.  However the faster paced paired with the poor cueing is distracting.  This section also gets a little too repetitive but that may be its saving grace from the bad instructions.",1417824000,,794,4.96969696969697
8313847,3,B001JXPC5A,"I have been using this DVD for 2 weeks. The DVD is not technically difficult but you have to the will power to get through it and not to turn it off half way through. I find it reapetative & a little boring .Kimberly doesn't speak the whole way through the DVD it has a voice over, this has caused the cueing to be off. Kimberly's cheesy grinning the whole way through is a little irritating.
If you can get past the negatives and stick it out you will see some reults (I have after 2 weeks).  I would suggest alternating this DVD with another or it will end up in a drawer somewhere never to be seen again.",1377302400,,607,4.100840336134453
8313848,2,B001JXPC5A,"Difficult to get in the swing, using exercises not familiar with.  Did not consider the general public, went for dancers with sixy bodies, i'm far from that!!",1368921600,,158,4.851851851851852
8313849,1,B001JXPC5A,"I bought one of her DVD before where she also does capoera and I loved it, I thought that this DVD was going to be the same as the last one or even better... is boring for me... I don't recommend it!!!!",1335484800,,202,3.8333333333333335
8313850,5,B001JXPC5A,"This video really doesn't feel like a workout but you work it.
Is fun the music is great and the time passes by quickly.
This is different of all the workouts I have because it feel like a mix of tribal and contemporaneous dance.
The moves are easy but if you want to do them right they are challenging. You are always moving and you will do a good exercise to your legs but to your whole body.",1266537600,,394,4.064102564102564
8313851,2,B001JXPC5A,"Ok, I exercise everyday and do a lot of different workouts, but when you advertise ""burn"" I'm expecting a certain level of exercise, and this one just didn't deliver.  I will say that I recently purchased Dance and be Fit Hip Hop Cardio and Loved it, but this did not give me even remotely the same kind of fun, dance-oriented workout.

Here are the things that I just didn't care for:

1.  Poor cuing, to the point where her companion exercisers are lost several times when she makes a quick change that doesn't quite go with the flow of the moves.

2.  BORING (note the caps)choreography-it is dance, it is supposed to be fun....when I'm checking my watch to see how much longer I have to go until I'm done, that is not a good sign.

3.  Bouncing into stretches....really poor form there.  You should hold the stretches static, not bounce into them.

4.  Head rolls-several times she relaxes the neck by rolling the head all the way to the back-from everything I know this is also not good form grinding your neck disks in this manner (side, to the chest, other side=ok, all the way around....no.)

5.  Burn?  No....no burn here....not even a little smolder.

I'm not sure exactly who I could even say this is targeted to.  Those who do dance videos will be bored and will not get a good aerobic workout, yet a beginner would be hard-pressed to follow some of her moves, especially some of her unusual warm-up moves and no one, beginner or not likes boring.

I would recommend steering clear. There are way too many dance workouts that really are good to pick this one unless you have tried other videos by this instructor and are a fan (this was my first with her as the instructor).",1264982400,,1686,4.493421052631579
8313852,5,B001JXPC5A,"""I love this DVD and the Dance and Be Fit series with Kimberly. She is very perky and lovely to watch and listen to. The production is very well-done: the stylish stage setting; pretty girls and wardrobe as well as the accompanying music. Aside from that, the menu offers a dance-like warm-up and 2-20 minute workouts. I really enjoy doing the ""Heavenly Hips"" because of the slower pace and you get to do the movements many times and you'll end up working your total body. For a more up tempo routine, you'll be doing lots of kicks and slightly more complicated moves on the ""Lovely Legs."" Overall, Kimberly makes dancing lively and fun with her consistent smiling, offers helpful tips on body placement, and leads such a feminine, freeing workout!""",1263340800,,749,4.769230769230769
