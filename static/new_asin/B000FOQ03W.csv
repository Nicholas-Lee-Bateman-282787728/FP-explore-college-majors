2581221,5,B000FOQ03W,"I'm very pleased with this DVD, which actually contains two programs: ""Secrets of the Koran"" and, as a bonus feature, ""Muhammad"" from A&E's ""Biography"" series. I've used excerpts from both of these programs in teaching world religions in college and high school. Both programs honor the Muslim tradition of not depicting Muhammad or members of his immediate family.

""SECRETS OF THE KORAN"" (91 min.) is an excellent documentary on the history of the Koran and its interpretation. Topics include the religious and social milieu into which Muhammad was born; the life of Muhammad and the revelation of the verses of the Koran; the early Muslim community; the compilation of the Koran; the Koran's relationship to Jewish and Christian revelations; the Muslim understanding of the apocalypse and judgment; difficulties in the interpretation of the Koran; jihad; the Koran's emphasis on the value of knowledge; the golden age of Islam; the Crusades; Islamic fundamentalism; and violent vs. peaceful understandings of the message of the Koran.

""MUHAMMAD"" (42 min.) isn't a biography precisely. Rather, it's a presentation of the traditional story of the life of Muhammad, with commentary by scholars who are Muslim or sympathetic to Islam (including two of the usual suspects, Karen Armstrong and John Esposito). This program does a good job of bringing the story of Muhammad to life, and because it's so concise, it may be more useful in my teaching than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Message/dp/B000AQ6A4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Message</a>"" (a three-hour movie about the life of Muhammad), which is also good.

2581222,5,B000FOQ03W,"Having watched it when it aired on television, I had decided I had to own this.  This helped me to better understand the Koran.  It is one thing to have read the Koran, it is another to have it explained (such as it were) by Muslims and scholars.  All in all, this was a very informative, well presented look into the Koran and Islam; where it came from and where it may go in the future.",1169078400,29,388,4.078947368421052
2581223,4,B000FOQ03W,"This program is from History Channel and has two parts: Origin (revelation) of the Koran and Jihad (i.e. moral ""struggle"" in English) and how Muslims interpret the Koran. There is a bonus section of Prophet Muhammad's biography. Don't expect you'll see actors to perform as Pro. Muhammad and his immediate family as it is against the Muslims' beliefs. DVD quality is better than most HC's historical documentaries.

Minus one star because there's no mention of Five Pillars of Islam (the profession of faith, five prayers a day, charity, fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca).",1164931200,35,604,5.101010101010101
2581234,1,B000FOQ03W,"It is the worst movie that I have ever seen about Islam. It has nothing to do with the ""Secrets"" of the Coran as the title, but a lot of political issues. I really do not recomend it to anybody.",1325116800,3,194,3.875
2581235,5,B000FOQ03W,"We ordered this DVD to supplement a book we were reading for a study group at church in recognition of the 10th Anniversery of 9/11.  Members of the study group were interested in learning more about the Islam religion to help facilitate understanding, love, and peacefulness between various religious groups.  We also attended an interfaith conference at our local Islam Center which explored how similar (mostly) the Christian, Islam and Jewish faiths are.",1320019200,2,458,5.260273972602739
2581236,1,B000FOQ03W,"This film whitewash the bloody history of Islam and avoid talking about its violent and exclusive ideology. There is one thing the producer should have conveyed to the viewer: no violence, no Koran.",1312329600,7,198,5.03030303030303
2581237,4,B000FOQ03W,"This DVD is an interesting introduction to the Koran and it's history. It's not a deep scholarly study--it's made for television and produced to be accessible to a mass audience that is largely unfamiliar with Islam. As that, it is well paced and professionally produced--similar to other programs on the History Channel.

Of course, if you want to study the Koran and Islam in a serious fashion, you will probably look to books or classes and not rely on a television script.

By the way, if you are interested in the Islamic faith, be sure to look into Sufism as well. Sufism is a 'mystical' sect of Islam that is intentionally heart and art focused. Check out Meher Baba also.

2581238,5,B000FOQ03W,"I ended up giving this video away, was not what I thought it was. My mistake",1249171200,,76,3.8125
2581239,2,B000FOQ03W,"The video is a poor attempt to explain the immerging and effect of the Holy Book of Quraan
It didn't touch base on major aspects of the book that is full of miracles amzing the religious same as scientists of what the context carries
I really recommend researchers to find something on the book that is done by a suphysticated Islamic univercities such as Zaytuna in London or Al-Azhar in Cairo.. and by the European catholic by birth currently Muslim researchers such as Karen Armstrong and the most brilliant Hamza Yusuf [...]
This DVD is good if you can do with a one page brief for an encyclopedia!",1241481600,,602,4.583333333333333
2581240,2,B000FOQ03W,"I was disappointed by this DVD set.  I couldn't help but think that the producers just about turned back-flips to white-wash some of the less pleasant aspects of Islamic history and the Koran.  For example, very little was said about the concept of jihad and what the Koran says about it.  For another example, the DVD featured an interview with John Esposito, who has been accused by more than a few people of excessively downplaying the Koran's more bellicose verses.  I don't have a problem with hearing from Esposito, who is obviously a learned man, but for balance there should have been someone like Bernard Lewis or even Daniel Pipes presenting a critical view.

Overall, the DVD set didn't have much more knowledge than I think one would get from perhaps taking an ""Islam 101"" course in college.  As such, it's not worth the price one has to pay to buy it here.

One final observation:  it was fascinating to hear that Muslims essentially believe that Christianity and Judaism's sacred books are distortions of the true word of God (which prompted God to reveal the Koran to Mohammed).  I have no problem with this interpretation of things by them, but I can't help but note that Salman Rushdie's satirical ""Satanic Verses"" which suggested much the same thing about the Koran prompted murderous outbursts of violence and a fatwa calling for the death of the author from Ayatollah Khomeini that remains in force to this day.  It's my belief that this speaks volumes about ""tolerance"" displayed by many Muslims (that they expect people to ignore what they say about competitor faiths like Judaism and Christianity but erupt in fury or worse if someone doubts the authenticity of their faith).",1229299200,16,1698,4.864583333333333
2581241,4,B000FOQ03W,"Well researched.  Very informative.  The first disk is basically about how Islam began and how the Quran was written, and the second disk talks about some of the passages in the book.",1203811200,6,183,4.6875
2581242,1,B000FOQ03W,"Added nothing, no single new inforamtion can be found in this title.

Dont waste your money.",1195776000,9,92,4.75
2581243,4,B000FOQ03W,"""Decoding The Past: Secrets Of The Koran"" is a good documentary covering all the basics of the Holy book of Islam.  Additionally, a biography of prophet Muhammad is included as a special feature, which I thought was a welcome bonus.

The Secrets Of The Koran is a well done, well researched DVD, covering most of the questions a typical Westerner might have about Islam's interpretation of this holy text.  One thing I found appealing is the fact that the program addresses extremism in Islam, and explains how the fundamentalists take the verses of the Koran out of context by reading incomplete verses that suit the extremists' purposes.

The biography of Muhammad was much more tame, and exceptionally politically correct.  The biography itself was rather short and covered the basics of the prophet's life, also concentrating on Islam as a whole, and reverting back to the Koran.  I expected the program to be more about the prophet himself, as the original Secrets Of The Koran already covered other aspects.

I do recommend this DVD as a starting point for anyone who has no knowledge of the Koran or prophet Muhammed.  Very educational and to the point, it leaves one with many questions to be answered through further research.",1176940800,10,1235,4.932367149758454

8125225,2,B000FOQ03W,"Muslim ""scholars'"" priority number one is to keep Islam so complicated a maze that it seems far more substantive and profound than it is.
The ""relationship"" between the Bible and the Koran is that the Koran was largely clumsily plagiarized from the Bible.
Allah is nothing but a big bully, and Muhammad, if he indeed existed at all, was no ""prophet"".
I'm fully aware that even the painfully obvious about Islam is verboten to be voiced in America today by the pseudo-tolerant Left.
This nation is unquestionably doomed if too many of us allow the Lost Left to make the rules for us.
The Left is in bed with Islam because they have common enemies:Christianity and the United States.  They're combining forces to remove the last 2 obstacles to their respective Utopias.  If they're successful the fun will really begin when they each find their ""tolerance"" can no longer abide the other's heresy from their respective cult doctrine.
True that.",1343347200,4,941,4.875
