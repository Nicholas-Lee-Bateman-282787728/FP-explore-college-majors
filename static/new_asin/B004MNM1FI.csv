4431996,4,B004MNM1FI,"Director Carlos Cesar Arbelaez won the Best New Director Award at the San Sebastian Film Festival for his Los Colores de la Montaa (The Colors of the Mountain) his debut feature. The film deals with the issue of sociopolitical conflict in a remote mountain region of Columbia as seen through the eyes of a child. While looking at war through a child's eyes is not new in cinema Abelaez concentrates on the small issues of life and leaves most of the violence off screen.

Manuel (Hernan Mauricio Ocampo) has just been given a new soccer ball for his ninth birthday. He and his friends kick the ball onto the local soccer field which has been newly mined by the paramilitary forces who are occupying his region of the country. The remainder of the film sees Manuel and his friends Julian( Nolberto Sanchez) and Paco Luz trying to get the ball back. As this is happening the adults in the village are trying to carry on their lives while caught between the military forces and the guerilla bands that are slowly moving in. According to Arbelaez the ball is a metaphor for the ridiculous nature of the life the villagers are living.

Shot almost entirely from the children's perspective, Arbelez tackles universal themes of conflict and its impact on ordinary people without getting mired in specific politics. He deftly shows how quickly normality can disintegrate when conflict appears on the horizon. And despite having serious subject matter, he has a lightness of touch, an avoidance of outright displays of violence and an eye for the comedic that means older children could enjoy this as much as adults. Arbelez was a deserving winner of the New Director's award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last year and this sweetly powerful debut suggests he's a name to look out for in future.

Film Movement has done a great job with this film and the presentation is as vibrant as anything I've seen in the recent crop of major studio releases. The photography by Oscar Jimenez brings out all the colors and natural beauty of the mountanous region of Columbia and a times is quite stunning. I have been told that this film will be released in the United States later this summer and the chance to see it before the official release was a welcome one. This is a film with great promise and is definately worth seeking out.",1300924800,3,2321,4.711822660098522

4432002,4,B004MNM1FI,"First things first, let me say that I've been a fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie films for quite some time now, and when I saw this title at my local library the other day, not knowing anything about this movie, I picked it up. Boy, am I glad I did.

""The Colors of the Mountain"" (originally released in 2010; 93 min.) starts off very innocently, mostly just the life ordinary of Colombian families in the country-side, and focusing on a group of young kids, for whom the most important thing is being able to play football (a/k/a soccer as it's known here in the US). The film moves at glacial speed, and I mean that as a compliment. The kids' biggest problem arises when a soccer ball gets lost in what turns out to be a field mined by the Colombian anti-government guerrilas. As the movie evolves, the influence of the guerrilas in this remote village becomes stronger. I don't want to give more of the plot away, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out. A special mention to the child-actors in the movie, who are nothing short of outstanding, none more than the boy who plays the 9 yr. old main character Manuel.

What a terrific movie this is! Thank you Film Movement for releasing this in the US, seriously. This is just one of those ""little"" movies that captures you and leaves you mesmorized. This is, needless to say, miles away from Iron Man 2 or the latest Twilight Saga movie, but in my book ""The Colors of the Mountain"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1321920000,,1495,4.432727272727273
4432003,4,B004MNM1FI,"Although this is a good drama about the guerrilla colombiana as seen through the eyes of childhood, the way the characters speak Spanish is very difficult to understand even for Spanish-speaking audiences. Word stress, poor diction and, most of all, slang forms make it hard to follow. Curiously enough, some time ago I had the chance to experience the same problem while watching another colombian movie - LA VENDEDORA DE ROSAS. Believe it or not, although my native language is Spanish, I understood almost nothing! Fortunately, this DVD contains English subtitles which help a lot to understand what the characters say. Take this as a tip, and watch it that way in case you know English, otherwise you'll have more than one instance in which you'll get totally lost. The story is rough, violent and emotionally difficult to cope, but worth watching and very interesting.",1317945600,,873,5.027586206896552

Growing up anywhere isn't really easy, especially once you hit the age of nine or so. At that age, you're starting to understand that there's a greater adult world that you don't have access to, and that doesn't intersect with your own, except for certain horrible times. Hard though being at that age is anywhere, I can only imagine how much worse it must be to be a child and grow up in a war zone. That's the situation in which young Manuel finds himself in The Colors of the Mountain.

The story centers around a picturesque mountain village in Colombia. It's a place where families scrape by, earning what they can by farming. You know, the standard salt-of-the-earth kind of people. They ask nothing from life and get even less.

Manuel lives there with his mother, farther and little baby brother. His biggest passion in life is soccer, though he also enjoys drawing and loves hanging out with his friends Julian and Poca Luz. He even loves going to school, though at least in part that seems to be due to him developing a crush on a girl there and on his teacher.

Not all is well in Manuel's world, though he's not really aware of that fact. His village is in an area where rebels are fighting the national military; each of whom seem to be worse than the other. Manuel's father walks a narrow line of not supporting either, and, well, you know what happens with people like that in wars like this.

Manuel is vaguely aware of these things happening, but not really. The war is something that doesn't matter to him. Or at least it doesn't matter until his birthday rolls around and he gets a soccer ball which winds up in the middle of a minefield...
This really is a wonderful movie. It's very touching and at times very funny. The performances all around are excellent, especially by Hernan Maurico Ocampo, who plays Manuel.

Also, the film is flat-out beautiful, showing the lush countryside of the Colombian mountains. Like most Americans, those mountains are something I'm really only accustomed to seeing in news reports about the ongoing drug war. It's nice to see them in a somewhat more pleasant way.
And I must say, I found myself really caring about the characters. There's at least a couple whose fate is left up in the air at the end of the movie, and I'd really like to learn what became of them (though I suspect the answer is ""nothing good"").

This isn't always an easy movie to watch, and it's one that I'd have a tough time recommending for younger children. But it is a beautiful, well-acted and generally wonderful film and for any adult audience, I highly recommend it.

=== Short Film ===

This month's short film is a Cuban film called ""The Swimmers"". It's about a determined swim coach who wants his young charges to be the best swimmers around. The fact that their pool is currently devoid of water is something he seems to view as merely a minor setback.

This was a good film, and quite funny in parts, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the main feature. It's worth seeing, but it's not worth picking up the disc just for this movie.",1314921600,2,3144,4.53886925795053
4432005,4,B004MNM1FI,"Los Colores de la Montaa (The Colors of the Mountain) is one of the more delicate and sophisticated films to deal with warring factions in South American countries to come along in a long time.  Written and directed by newcomer Carlos Csar Arbelez  this story is wise because it explains the work through the eyes of children: perhaps that is the best way to understand the conflicts that flood the planet at present.

Set is the lush and picturesque mountains of Colombia, we gradually discover through the games of the children that there are two factions struggling for power in this remote area - the military of the government and the reactive guerrillas.  Manuel (Hernn Mauricio Ocampo) is eight and loves soccer even though his soccer ball is an old collapsed mess of toy. He and his friends Julin (Nolberto Snchez) and the little albino boy Poca Luz (Hernn Mndez) play soccer anyplace they can.  Manuel also tends to his duties as a farmer's son (his father is devoted to him, sharing the chores, and protecting him and his wife and baby from the bilateral dangers of the military and the guerrillas): his parents reward him on his ninth birthday with a new soccer ball and gloves.  Very proud, Manuel shares his treasure with his friends but accidentally the ball lands in a minefield (the result of the military invasion) and becomes inaccessible.  The boys challenge Poca Luz to retrieve it but he fails. A new teacher comes to the village and brings order to the chaos the children feel.  Discovering that Manuel colors pictures of his countryside in his notebook the teacher decides to use his talent that that of his friends to paint over political graffiti smeared on the schoolhouse: she loses her job.  Rebel forces and military forces enter the village and families are forced to evacuate - but Manuel manages to recover his treasured new soccer ball in the midst of the senseless fighting the adults of his world are staging. After all, what is really important?!

The acting skills of these children are beautifully straightforward and unforced, thanks to the fine direction of Arbelez.  He manages to tell a tale that is tender, humorous, and meaningful and in the end it is the inherent pure wisdom of children that seems to be the sustaining factor in the little villages of the mountains of Colombia.  The lush photography is by Oscar Jimenez.  This is a very fine film that has already won awards in festival, but it is a film that is more important that it be shared by a very large audience.

4432006,5,B004MNM1FI,"I saw this movie in the Spanish class that I am taking for my job.  After it was over, one of the other students asked in what year did the story take place.  The instructor (from Colombia) looked shocked and said ""this is how life is now for people in these areas.""  I at once felt thankful to live where I do, where I don't worry about my kids' soccer fields being filled with landmines, and I also felt somewhat ashamed.  As a country we Americans whine and complain about so much, and we don't realize just how great we have it.  We don't have to worry about teachers being run out of schools by people who want to use it for their own propaganda and we don't have to choose between unwillingly taking up arms and being killed because we don't.

9 year old Manuel gets a new soccer ball for his birthday and it promptly gets accidentally thrown into a field that has recently been filled with land mines.  He and his friend Julian spend much of the rest of the movie trying to get the ball back, usually by coercing albino ""Poca Luz"" to join them, while the violence goes on all around them.  Their parents are hard working farmers who must decide whether to stay and protect their land, or flee.

I love movies that make me think and this is definitely one of those.",1307232000,17,1271,4.2845188284518825

8436115,5,B004MNM1FI,"This is a foreign film produced about Columbians.  It is obvious to have full appreciation of this production, the viewer is required to consider every episode from that culture especially the young boys Manuel, Julian and Poca Luz.  One of the boys, Poca Luz is an albino by birth.  The living conditions are traumatic due to Columbian Government Troops and Rebels in asymmetrical warfare that all of the adults avoid - and some disappeared.  The boys are in families who are hard-working farmer parents in the remote mountainous region of Colombia.  The boys are obsessed to play soccer with fields plagued by land mines.  Manuel gets a soccer ball for a birthday present that was kicked into a nearby mine field?!  He and his friends are in terrible fear because they have seen animals blown up that wandered into the field.  The ball is retrieved after several attempts.  But each boy lost his father in successive incidents of unsolved disappearance who were seized by the military or the rebels.  Finally the school closed, a truck arrived and each family moved to a refugee center.  There is nothing luxurious about life at all.  With good English captions this is a five star DVD with a superb plot to show everything from the point of a Columbian boy's view.  Well done and good education about a civil war that has not ended.",1498608000,,1335,4.752173913043478

8436120,4,B004MNM1FI,"Touching anti-war film about a nine year old boy in a small rural villiage in Colombia.  The boy, Manuel,  just wants to play with his friends, all of whom manage to stay fairly oblivious the the civil war slowly encroaching on their town.  The rebels threaten those who won't join up (including Manuel's father), and the government troops on the other side are ready to kill any they even suspect of being rebels.  Its truly a hellish no-win situation for the farmers and families of this otherwise pretty idyllic farm area.

The film is told mostly from the boys perspective, leading to some interesting contrasts between what we as an adult audience can glean about whats really going on, while enjoying the sweet innocence of Manuel and his friends' perceptions, as they try to hang onto their childhoods.  While I respected the film, and even admired it, its so understated, that it had a bit less emotional kick than I was expecting on first viewing.  But it got stronger and more emotional on a second watch, once I was used it it's quiet tone.  There were still a few moments that felt a bit forced, and not all the kid actors are great, but neither flaw was enough to get in the way of being left moved and thoughtful.",1449100800,,1227,4.570776255707763

I wouldn't recommend this to high school Spanish teachers for classroom use just because it is so unrelentingly sad. Because we are watching events through the eyes of a young boy, we are spared some of the overt violence that takes place.
