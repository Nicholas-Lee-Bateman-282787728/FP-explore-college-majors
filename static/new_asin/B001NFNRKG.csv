8326754,4,B001NFNRKG,Typical 60's sword-and-sandal adventure.  This time Maciste fights an evil regime that is raiding the countryside and has usurped the rightful rulers of an African kingdom.  This film had some exteriors filmed in South Africa.  It shows a pretty authentic native village and the sets and costumes are colorful.  My main praise is for the DVD-R I obtained from Movies Unlimited.  The cover is extremely colorful (the one pictured below) and the transfer is wonderful.  The color is brilliant and the picture is crystal clear.  The only minor flaw is though it is dubbed one or two lines are in Italian.  It does not stop the flow of the story.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.,1419897600,,685,4.786324786324786

You must not buy the article of this maker.",1231545600,2,271,4.230769230769231
