8582573,4,B0091AH9LI,"This is a film based on selected sections of a unique text, really a daily
diary, of the life of a man who was born in the beginning of the 20th century
into a poor family in Sicily.  In spite of limited education and opportunities,
he literally recorded most of his life in daily entries, neatly typed and bound,
following him through WW1, WW2, and the post-war turbulence of Italy. Along the
way he had a family and a somewhat normal life which is celebrated within this
unique documentary film. The filmmaker is an anthropologist, who studied film before
she went to post-graduate school! A must for anyone interested in the cultural
and historical life of Italy in the 20th century.
