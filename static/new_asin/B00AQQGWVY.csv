I contacted gnomon directly, to see if I could get the digital download version, since my computer doesn't have a disk drive. And they told me that since i didn't purchase it through them, they wouldn't give me the digital version. So now i have a $60 tutorial that i can't watch.",1400284800,,412,4.363636363636363
