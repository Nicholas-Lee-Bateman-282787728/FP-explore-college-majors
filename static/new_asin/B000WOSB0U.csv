So it is with a heavy sigh of relief that I wholeheartedly recommend this Academy Award nominated documentary, OPERATION HOMECOMING: WRITING THE WARTIME EXPERIENCE.

First let's look at why this film is so successful. It's fresh. Most war writings are done by established or well-groomed writers, giving them decent syntax, etc., but lacking that up-close and personal process that goes along with firing weapons and being fired at during war. And this is where Operation Homecoming succeeds. The writings are all firsthand accountings from soldiers who've walked the walk and talked the talk.

Secondly is the unique filming. Each segment contains a different milieu and a different style of filming. From animation to quick-flash photography of those that've given their lives, the stories are told in a highly interesting fashion that keeps the viewer very interested.

Thirdly is the internal conflict that so easily comes across. From the beginning of the film when soldiers discuss their upbringing from childhood and being told killing is wrong, to being thrown into a situation where you're trained to kill for ""God and Country,"" the film watcher understands the conundrum these men and women are put into.

The final successful element is the men and women themselves and how they deal with tough situations. There's never the ""Why am I here"" question asked. They know why they're there. They don't care about policy or partisan politics or money or oil. They care about the guy to their left and right who's protecting their backside during a fire-fight.

Each `chapter' (if you will) contains a title and the story of a soldier. From the grunts on the ground, to the medic flying the injured to Germany, to the honor guard who sees the dead to their final resting place, Operation Homecoming is truly a unique gem in the documentary genre.",1209427200,13,2173,5.376470588235295

It's so easy to look at the men and women in uniform and not see anything but the uniform. This documentary reveals the feeling, thinking human beings that the public doesn't see, but without pushing a particular political or social agenda. Military veterans, in their own words, describe the boredom, terror, grief, anger, and yes, amusement, that is life in a combat zone, and the filmmakers brilliantly bring the GI's words to life using a variety of cinematic styles, each appropriate to the story being told. The result is a riveting film that does the best job I've ever seen of connecting the viewer with the people in the story, instead of just observing from the outside.

8224492,5,B000WOSB0U,"I just viewed this film though the Netflix feed to my TV, and have added it to my wish list. As a navy photographer for approximately two years in Vietnam I came home an irrevocably different individual than when I departed. This documentary is the best I have seen that captures the essence of the human toll of any combat experience. Those of us who returned physically whole were nonetheless emotionally scarred for life. You carry with you a burden that is sometimes too great to bear. Survivor's guilt, guilt over the things you have done or witnessed, guilt for having in any way been a part of such an obscenity. There is a quote from Plato in this film that sums up the reality of these conflicts, which is ""Only the dead have seen the end of war.""

My wife frequently asked why I never talked of my Vietnam experiences, and I would flippantly dismiss these queries with a comment about it being ""ancient history."" The truth, of course, is that the traumas had all been ""safely"" locked away behind a door that was never intended to be reopened. You return knowing that you are a changed individual, feeling as though you have left your soul behind and that marriage and children are not a sensible part of your future. Anger and trust issues plague you day and night, and you self-medicate with alcohol and/or street drugs to dull the pain that never goes away. The lucky ultimately suck it up and soldier on, reintegrating as best as possible into society. But the symptoms and muscle memory from the wartime experiences create a continuation of behavior patterns so deeply ingrained that you do not even realize they are there, or how destructive they are to all relationships. I shall acquire this film for my library, because it is the best way in which I can convey to my folks, my ex and my children an explanation for my own dysfunctional behavior of the past 40+ years.

Whether you are a veteran of a theater of combat, the parent of such a veteran, a family member of such a veteran, or simply a citizen with a desire for a deeper understanding of the dynamics associated with war and its aftermath, I highly recommend this film as a primer on the heavy price that is paid by the youth of each successive generation sent off in the name of preserving our national security. The blood and treasure wasted on these misadventures serve an oligarchy that profits handsomely in increased power and fattened bank accounts through the sacrifice of yet another generation of our youth, all while incurring debt that enslaves future generations. If the individuals profiting from war had to send their own children, or better yet had to go and perform the dirty work themselves, wars would end in a heartbeat. The old axiom that the one thing that we learn from history is that we do not learn from history applies as well today as it did during the time of Cicero in the ancient Roman Empire.",1351296000,,2902,4.600386100386101
8224493,5,B000WOSB0U,"In this video the voices of war ring clear.  One writer, a Vietnam vet, says that it is a decadent society which sends it's sons and daughters to war, but is not willing to hear their stories, or to see what they have lived through.  I agree.  Buy this DVD, watch it and then pass it on to someone else, or donate it to your public library.  It is a small price to pay.

8224494,5,B000WOSB0U,"Poignant, well-produced, well-acted, engaging, fair, direct, and diverse in presentation.  Multiple perspectives from many sides of these wars help to demonstrate that war is not The Hurt Locker, and that our veterans are not victims of George Bush or the military or whatever boogeyman is in vogue in the national media.  These are true stories that cut to the heart in their intensity and their honesty.

8224496,5,B000WOSB0U,"I don't want to be highly repetitive with what others have written so I will be brief. I have watched several documentaries on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some have been good, some have left a bit to be desired. Something that all of the other ones had in common was that they were told by reporters, high ranking officers, and bureaucrats. This is different. It's told by the soldiers who were actually there. They recounted their experiences, not just generically talking about events but they discuss how they felt, what their thoughts were, etc.

Mixtures of photographic images and drawn images, narrated by the ones who were there and put their lives on the line, this documentary is emotionally charged and highly moving. I highly recommend this documentary, especially if you have ever asked the question to someone who has served in this war, ""What was it like?""",1274140800,,876,4.84
8224497,5,B000WOSB0U,"If war brings the unexpected, this was one of those experiences for the authors who were sent to Iraq to teach workshops to the troops. They found the common fighting man and women could write with prose that made their own pale in comparison. These are their words, their videos, their boredom, and their guilt. It is their attempt to make sense of a senseless situation that challenges a soldier's values, emotions, reality, and equilibrium.

All the nobility of war is shattered when convoys must run over little children sent in their paths by Iraqi irregulars to stop them, so they can get a clearer shot. Guilt, overriding, permeating guilt that will sear the mind for a lifetime appears in one moment of action, one decision, one hesitation to act. Boredom, unrelenting, for hours that turns into days. What is there to do? Cards, wrestling, boxing, reading, sleeping and writing. Action relieves the bonds of ennui, only to realize that the friend you went out with, didn't come back. Humor, a salve against reality and fear, comes in spontaneous spurts. It provides a relief from guilt and boredom.

Training teaches men to do what they have learned a lifetime not to do--to kill, without thought, without feeling. Training and values come into conflict. Training wins, barely. It brings out hatred for the enemy that killed a friend, or the hatred that comes from having made the decision to kill. They hate the victim for making them do the unthinkable. The war with oneself begins. It will never end. There will be no morphine to make it go away. There will never be victory against the onslaught of thoughts that will assault the self and its well-being.

The non-combatants fare no better. They will lie to the dying trooper of the 101st Airborne who asks why his feet are cold. The medic tells him there is swelling that causes poor circulation. The toes on one foot are gone. He rationalizes; he hasn't been entirely dishonest. He gives him a smile that says he will be okay. The trooper is relieved. They will change dressings from wounds that fester, that smell, that have pus and sand, that repels them, that makes them feel guilt for their own revulsion. They want the wounded to stop coming, if only they will stop coming, but they don't.

Soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, veterans reflect on their experiences, the reality that ""the world,"" civilians and home, have no idea what they went through, mortal moments that cannot be explained, the disillusion that their near-death experiences went unreported, were unheard of.

This black and white film, well-narrated by Robert Duvall and Stacey Keech, brings to life the experiences of veterans from World War II to the present. Their writing, their videos, and cartoons, revealed their own way of dealing with the life and death that surrounded them. Their decision to avenge a nation or defend it, to save the world or bring democracy, dissolves in the first concussion from the mortar round that falls too close. It becomes dependence on your friend to ensure your survival, as you ensure his. It is not about a nation's pride, but the wrenching fear that jolts the entire body with a feeling of impotence, terror and adrenaline.

There are also pictures of those that do not speak. Almost all are smiling faces or martial poses in dress blues, West Point Cadet Gray, battle dress, nuptials, fathers or mothers holding spouses or children, high school pictures and anniversaries. They are the reminders of people who once lived, who live now only in memories.

This one hour and twenty minute experience is sobering, and is recommended for viewing by anyone considering taking up arms and going in harm's way. It's message is apolitical. It's message is that war is futile and destructive beyond measure to the body and the human spirit, that coming home without scars is irrational, that coming home with them is human but destructive.

Perhaps stories like this, are the only good that can come from war. If you have to miss one, miss war, and see this instead.

8224498,5,B000WOSB0U,"""Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience"" is an Oscar-nominated  documentary made up almost entirely of journal entries and poems written by soldiers and marines in combat.  Operation Homecoming was a program developed by the National Endowment For the Arts in which distinguished authors were sent to military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan to teach soldiers and their families how to capture their experiences of war on paper.  Ultimately, thousands of pages worth of personal reflections, in the form of essays, anecdotes and poems, were submitted to the project, only a very small handful of which could, by necessity, find their way into this film.

If nothing else, ""Operation Homecoming"" serves as an invaluable tool documenting what life is like for the common fighting man toiling in the trenches of not only these two specific wars but of any armed conflict.  Notably absent from the film are statements and speeches made by military strategists, politicians and world leaders whose views we hear expressed ad infinitum and ad nauseam throughout the course of any military action.  In their place are the thoughts and words of the men and women on the front lines, who day after day confront the actual face of war.

Through their essays and poems, these authors convey, with tremendous eloquence and insight, just what it means to live in near-constant fear of being injured or killed; or to see one's friends and comrades fall under a hail of bullets or be blown to smithereens by a detonated explosive; or to wrestle with the guilt of having snuffed out a fellow human being's life despite the fact that you've been raised from infancy to believe killing is wrong.  As have many authors before them (Stephen Crane in ""The Red Badge of Courage"" comes first to mind), some of these writers show how the heroic idealism of a pre-war mindset can be instantly shattered when confronted with the brutal reality of life on the battlefield.  For some, the writing has become almost a form of therapy, allowing them to process the experience in the hopes of eventually coming to terms with it all - if that`s even possible.

The movie provides battle footage, still photos, staged reenactments and animation sequences, along with interviews with the actual writers and other authors on the subject (i.e., Anthony Swofford, Tobias Wolff) to visually complement and supplement the readings, which are delivered respectfully and movingly by such trained actors as Robert Duvall, Beau Bridges and Aaron Eckhart.

But all is not pure, unrelieved grimness.  There is also a bit of gallows humor in the writing, designed to alleviate not only the stress of combat but the long stretches of intense boredom that are also, paradoxically, a part of life in the field.  Indeed, there is probably not a single aspect of combat life that is not touched upon at some point in this film.  It's that comprehensive.

This movie takes the issue out of the realm of the abstract, clearing away all the jingoism and false bravado that often go into depictions of war.  These are just real people telling us their real stories in their own words, and some of them are absolutely heartbreaking.  Through its honesty and artistry, the film becomes a stirring tribute to each and every one of the fine young men and women who have risked their lives - and given their lives - in battle.  No matter your personal feelings about these particular wars or of war in general, you won't look at any of it in quite the same way again after seeing ""Operation Homecoming.""

And if you find yourself weeping - which you inevitably will - through the course of the film, you can do so without shame.",1235433600,,3680,4.887459807073955
