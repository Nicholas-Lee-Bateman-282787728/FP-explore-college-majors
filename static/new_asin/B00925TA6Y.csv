The performance is shot on Sydney Harbor with a backdrop of lights and buildings - a bit unconventional and some of the building signs are a bit disconcerting, but all-in-all a TREMENDOUS performance.  The singing is outstanding and the staging is well done.  The chandelier is a true marvel, and reminds you of so many great opera houses.  The Aussies did this one proud!",1417824000,,473,4.662650602409639
8534558,3,B00925TA6Y,"Several of these reviews seem to be reviewing a different production. This is the Teatro Regio di Parma production, not the Opera Australia production as some reviewers seem to think.",1374969600,,183,5.133333333333334
8534559,5,B00925TA6Y,"This prodction of La Traviata is the most beautiful one I have ever seen, and I have seen operas since I was born, since my mother was an opera soloist. The Australian singer is a fantastic coloratura soprano. It is a superproduction that surprises for the natural scenario, the elegant wardrobe, the orchestra played by musicians who play together for a longtime.
My friends and I really enjoyed the magic Australian La Traviata.",1374105600,,430,4.904109589041096

Beautiful sets and costumes.
Giordano and Stoyanov perfect in each role.
Very good performance",1369440000,2,147,5.434782608695652
8534561,5,B00925TA6Y,"Operas should be revitalised by new inspiration to make them relevant to today's new audiences rather than preserved in camphor. Opera Australia's new venture of a once-a-year opera performance on Sydney Harbour is a way of doing this as it challenges even the most basic tenets of putting on an opera. Directed by Francesca Zambello this La Traviata is a triumph of technical ingenuity in every aspect from the floating mirrored stage, to the suspension of the giant chandelier, to the amazing audio.

The stage props are necessarily sparse as there is minimal space for storage and no convenient curtain to effect scene changes behind. Yet, the props used are stunningly oversized and have impact, seamlessly moved into place, or removed, as part of the show. The stage itself conceals the orchestra `pit' below, so that performers and conductor can only see each other via video screens, and it is this, plus the challenges of recording anything out of doors that makes the quality of the audio so astounding. It is perfect in its clarity and lack of background noise. Okay, so the principle singers have to wear more substantial head mics to achieve this, but better this than poor audio - after all opera is primarily about the music! The costumes have been brought forward into the mid-20th century and the stage is vibrant with colour, style and luxury, reflecting the society in which Violetta struggles to survive, as in some way does the glittering backdrop of the cityscape.

Emma Matthews and Gianluca Terranova are brilliant, singing with passion and precision. Margaret Plummer (Flora) and Jonathan Summers (Germont) also deserve high praise for their parts; while John Bolton Wood convincingly hovers as Doctor Grenvil. A great production, well worth watching.",1365552000,,1775,5.096219931271477
8534562,3,B00925TA6Y,"It's good within the limitations of an outdoor event.

I didn't like the very prominent microphones or the frequent panning of the camera to what were presumably sponsors names on city buildings",1359158400,3,194,5.0625
8534563,1,B00925TA6Y,"I need another Traviata like I need a hole in the head, but I love all the previous opera australia blu-ray issues so much that I couldn't pass on this one. I watched it last week and was so disgusted I gave up after one act. I wasn't going to write a review because there are more important things in life than to trash a Traviata that a lot of people seem to like. There are a lot of people who like Andrea Bocelli; there are a lot of people who like what other people consider trash. It's one thing to engage in opera wars on a closed internet forum, but I wasn't going to get into that in an amazon review. However, seeing the 5 star orgy other reviewers engage in I have to speak up. Let me just describe what you get (in act I). It's an amplified outdoor event with everyone wearing huge body mics (not discreet ones). The singers are directed to run around so much that they get a good aerobic work-out. It affects their performance in different ways. They have to concentrate differently than in a regular indoor performance. A singer that can somehow manage Italian diction in a regular performance with great effort and concentration may not perform at his best in this regard under these athletic conditions.  This affects most of the singers here, except of course for Gianlucca Terranova. Comprimario roles rarely affect your enjoyment of a performance, but one singer (I won't name him) in a comprimario role here is so bad as far as his Italian diction, stage comportment and singing that his presence on the stage annoyed me to the point I wanted to strangle him. By the Brindisi the schlokiness of it all makes you cringe. There are other amplified outdoor operatic events. The most familiar from DVD's is the Mrbisch Festival in rural eastern Austria, on the shores of Lake Neusiedl.  What you get there is possibly also ""light entertainment"", but tasteful and idiomatic. At the end of the Brindisi there is a fireworks display! Having a fireworks display at this point seemed like premature ejaculation. Emma Matthews has all the notes and the passagework but she doesn't sing a Violetta, it's a circus. I'm sure she has a good Violetta in her, but not under the conditions this is directed. In contrast, Gianlucca Terranova, while far from being a first rate tenor, manages to maintain nevertheless the contours of the role of Alfredo both in his singing style and stage comportment. He looks and sounds like he wandered into an Australian beach party straight from a small Italian opera house and is not too impressed - he gives you a real Alfredo, not a vulgar overblown caricature. I think that's enough.",1354838400,22,2627,4.635193133047211
8534564,5,B00925TA6Y,"This is an easy review.  Four new releases from Opera Australia and all are SPECTACULAR, CREATIVE, and amongst the best new stagings I have recently viewed.  They are not perfect; but, DO THEY WORK !!!  They are LAKME, RIGOLETTO, DON GIOVANNI and  this new TRAVIATA. I will be reviewing each in the next few days.  Do yourself a favor and try all four.  They are bold, new and creative settings with mostly excellent musical values and fine detailed stage directorial touches.
1) Emma Matthews is the real thing a great coloratura VIOLETTA with a stunning E flat.  She is also an accomplished actress.  Her embellishments are great, runs, staccatti, everything is easy and natural for her.  She has it all and it's really her show all the way!
2) The production is updated to Sydney Harbor on a wonderful all flexible theatrical barge with the Opera House and Sydney Harbor for a back drop... it works.
3) Modern settings and colorful costumes that work and are ""eye candy.""
4) Excellent detailed directing by Francesca Zambello.  I will admit that in the past I have not always liked her ideas or work... a poorly concieved FLYING DUTCHMAN for Pittsburgh Opera with a controversial ending.  Here we get great direction.  A TRADITIONAL STAGING IN A DROP DEAD GORGEOUS MODERN SETTING complete with Harbor Fireworks for the Act One party.
5) Quite fine conducting and musical direction from Brian Castle-Onion.
6) Wonderful lighting, costumes and sets.
7) A credible Giorgio Germont from Jonathan Sumners in the autumn of an illustrious career.  A little vocal wear and tear but, still very fine with a lovely :Di Provenza"" and a great duet in Act Two with Violetta.  He really does psychologically manipulate: wear her down, which brings about her downfall.
8) Gianlucca Terranova is the only weak link in this ambitious production.  He is at best a Provincial Tenor who squeezes his way through the Passagio.  Not too bad, just not world class in this WORLD CLASS SETTING & PRODUCTION.
9) Don't miss the greatest First Act I've ever seen of this great opera.
10) A WORLD CLASS PRODUCTION AND SOPRANO.
11) After decades of knowing this work, this creative effort made it seem like I was seeing this old chestnut for the very first time.
12) This is a truly exciting time for Opera Australia.  I will be watching for anything new by them.
13) The camera work and audio are exceptional.  There isn't a camera angle change every 4 or 5 seconds as in recent MET HD releases.  Nor are there any embarassing super tight and huge close ups.  Everything is tastefully and artistically done!
14) TRAVIATA, RIGOLETTO, LAKME, DON GIOVANNI are all top notch!",1351728000,5,2645,4.8097345132743365

Everyone was very much aware of the tremendous sense of occasion communicated by this grandiose production set against the iconic backdrop of the Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge and glittering skyline. One of our French Jury members - a very experienced opera-goer and critic - said ""We are unlikely to see such a lavish production on this scale ever again"" !
There was great praise from everyone for the cast, particularly Emma Matthews (""Fantastic"", ""Fabulous"", ""Extraordinary"", ""Emotionally thrilling"") One of our Australian Jury members even said, ""We thought that no one could ever rival Joan Sutherland... but I think Emma Matthews does..."" Jonathan Summers as Germont was also singled out for special praise by several Jury members.
Without hesitation they gave it an A+ rating.
