8596724,5,B00DRPQFBS,"Love love love So Simple!! I have been teaching kinder for 11 years and I have used it with every class. They amaze me every year with the number of sight words they know, use, spell and read all because of this great program!! I highly recommend it!",1372809600,,250,4.229166666666667
8596725,5,B00DRPQFBS,"This program is the best! I have used it to teach my First Graders sight words, and now that I teach Kindergarten, I use it with them also. Fun, easy, motivating--even the shyest student will participate! The motions and simple tunes grab their attention and they REMEMBER the words. Even students in the upper grades still remember the tunes and motions for the words from when they learned them! The extra word work exercises that are part of the program are a bonus! You will love this program, but most importantly, your students will love it!",1372809600,,547,4.708333333333333
8596726,5,B00DRPQFBS,This is an awesome program that helps kids learn their sight words.  It is fun and absolutely amazing how quickly kids learn the cheer.  I teach Kindergarten and my kids have learned to read so well because of So Simple.  Kids have so much fun cheering.  During writing I will hear and see kids cheer words to themselves.  Can't say enough good things about it!,1372809600,,361,4.492307692307692
8596727,5,B00DRPQFBS,I have taught for 17 years and this is the best sight word program I've ever seen. I used them when I taught first grade and continue to use them as I homeschool my own kids. I love how easy it transfers from reading to spelling. The kids love how fun it makes learning. Thank you Patty for sharing your talent with us!!,1372809600,,320,4.095238095238095
