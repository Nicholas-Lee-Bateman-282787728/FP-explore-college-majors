3533452,4,B001DJLD0S,"As a whole, I give the entire Nightmare series 5 stars.  Well maybe all except Freddy's Dead.  But besides that, these 4-film fan packs are great.  Inside of leaving reviews for both packs, I'll just list a few problems I have with them:

1. They have the same menus that are found in the Nightmare DVD boxset, and individual DVD releases.  They could have at least done something new with the menus for a new release.

2. If your looking for deleted scenes from Freddy Vs. Jason, they aren't on here. It's just your standard widescreen/full screen movie with trailer and commentary.

3. An unrated version of Dream Child on DVD would be nice.  I know it's next to impossible to get though cause apparently the film master got ruined and they can't transfer it to DVD.  Ahh well...at least their is the trusty old VHS.

Besides these three problems, this set is good for two things.  It's a nice addition to anyone's Freddy collection.  And it's good for those who like to have Nightmare marathons.",1224028800,6,998,4.607954545454546

3533508,5,B001DJLD0S,"The dream demon returns in some of the final movies featuring Freddy Krueger. Part 5 called The Dream Child is included and it seems Freddy has a new, young pupil or does he? Freddy's Dead stars Robert Englund(Freddy), Lisa Zane, Lezlie Dean, and Shon Greenblatt. New Nightmare stars Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, David Newsom, and John Saxon. My personal favorite with the horror crossover of all time, Freddy vs. Jason(you read that right!) is also included. Monica Keena(sexy is an understatement!), Kelly Rowland(Destiny's Child), Jason Ritter, Chris Marquette, and more star in this all out slasher WAR between Freddy and Jason Voorhees(Friday the 13'th)! Blood and gore is how best to describe these films, especially the last one. Monica Keena(Night of the Demons) is so freakin' hot in this movie you will have to cool off in the shower after(maybe before!). Horror with slaher violence and even a warped sense of humor from Freddy make these films multi-genre and that is why they are still watched by teens, even the older ones like Dream Warriors.

3533635,5,B001DJLD0S,"These ""Four Film Favorites"" pack are a great value for fans of Freddy Krueger. This is a simple, cost-effective way of watching and owning the last four films in the Nightmare On Elm Street series.

As for the films, these are the lesser Freddy movies, the ones that are a bit more over the top. Fans usually don't like all the sequels and 5-8 are the ones that aren't remembered as fondly. I however really enjoy Part 5, Dream Child, as it is in the vein of the 3rd and 4th films. Part 6, Freddy's Dead: the Final Nightmare, is okay, but its only redeeming value is the cameo by Johnny Depp and the cool visuals. Part 7, New Nightmare is a departure as it features Freddy in the real world and explores the ramifications of what that would really mean. Freddy Vs Jason, the last film in this collection, is actually done well, considering that both Freddy and Jason were stale concepts in 2003 when the film was released.

The only drawback may be that these films are on 2 double-sided discs. This is a great value that can't be beat!",1355702400,3,1036,4.390625

3533639,4,B001DJLD0S,"I bought these used, and as such there is always the chance that the DVD might not be the best possible quality. There were scratches on a few of the disks which made viewing a bit difficult. I have always enjoyed the elms street series and absolutely love the 3 films that feature Heather Langenkamp. I feel that after the third film the series went from the horror genre to the comedy (dark comedy) genre.
The fifth, sixth, and Eighth movie in this set are hilarious examples of the wonderful dark humor that was Freddy Krueger, where he is the sole star of of the movies, and we the audience should only be watching for him. The seventh film both reminds us why the original film was so terrifying (Wes Cravens dark imagination) and returns the hero (Langenkamp) that we can get behind.",1348444800,,789,4.524475524475524

3533671,4,B001DJLD0S,"This budget DVD set contains the latter installments of The Nightmare on Elm Street series from the late 1980's to the 1990's and beyond.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 5(1989): This installment picks up where part four left off. Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund) tries to turn a woman's unborn baby against her. This is considered one of the weakest sequels in the series, but I think it's good.

Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare(1991): This was hyped as the last film in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I remember being given a pair of 3-D glasses at the film's theatrical debut. Freddy Krueger plans on preying on more kids. The surviving Elm Street kids get help from Freddy Krueger's daughter. This installment has blood and guts and a dark, moody atmosphere...and silly gags! I remember people in the movie theater laughing at Freddy Krueger playing Nintendo. There's also a spoof of those heavy handed anti-drug TV spots.

New Nightmare(1994): This was director Wes Craven's attempt at starting a new Nightmare on Elm Street film series. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, and Robert Englund play themselves in a work of fiction. The film has a self-aware, mind bending plot about a demon taking the form of Freddy Krueger. Krueger is given a ""dark makeover"". There's also references to the 1994 earthquake that shook Los Angeles, CA. Langenkamp must ""play Nancy"" and go into the dream world to save her son from Freddy Krueger. New Nightmare is a good film, but it did not start a new film franchise. New Nightmare does have a strong cult following.

Freddy vs. Jason(2003): This film shows Freddy Krueger fighting Jason Voorhees. It's directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Ronny Yu(The Bride With White Hair). It's packed with contrived storytelling and teenager stereotypes. Still, it's a fun, action packed, conventional horror film. The film is packed with nudity, sex, cursing, drug use, and bloodshed! Monica Keena, Jason Ritter, and Kelly Rowland play the film's heroes. Cute, sexy Katharine Isabelle plays a teenage girl who is hunted by Freddy and Jason!

This budget DVD set is worth the money if you love horror movies.",1344729600,,2139,4.997191011235955
3533672,3,B001DJLD0S,"The quality of the DVDs is great, so I have no complaints in that department.  However, I would not recommend NOES (Nightmare on Elm Street) Parts 5-8, for most people. My reasoning for this is that parts 5-8 are not  as good as parts 1-4. Also parts 5-8 are extremely inconsistent! I am glad that I bought this DVD package because again I am a huge fan, and just had to have every Freddy Kruger movie, available.

NOES Part 5:
Part 5 has to be my least favorite Freddy movie. There is no contingency, Alice and Dan are the only two returning characters besides Freddy. The plot of the movie is that Freddy wants to be reborn through Alice and Dan's unborn child. One by one Alice's friends begin to die in their sleep because Freddy gets them. I didn't really like the plot or the acting. Although I did enjoy getting more information about Freddy's childhood. Another negative aspect of this movie is that we were not able to see Freddy's humorous killings, which attracted me to the movies in the first place.

NOES Part 6:
In this movie we find out that Freddy Kruger had a child that was taken from him, when the news broke that he was a child murderer. This was an interesting twist. We also find out that Freddy has killed every child and teenager in Springwood. I didn't like this because in the last movie it was established that they had stopped Freddy - no explanation was given as to how he was able to kill again. I don't want to give away the ending, but I liked the ending to this movie because it reminded me of what Nancy tried to do in Part 1. Another aspect of this movie I did not like was that Alice (from part 4 and 5), was never mentioned.

NOES 7:
When the movie series ended I was sad about it, so I was really glad that this movie came out. I also enjoyed seeing the character that played Nancy once again. In this movie Freddy was more dark and less comical. I truly enjoyed part 7 and would recommend it to anyone.

Freddy vs. Jason:
I liked this movie because it explained how Freddy was able to come back from the ""dead."" Although I did not appreciate the inconsistent plot. In part NOES part 6, it was established that Freddy had killed every child and teenager on Elm street. However, in this movie police officials state that those teenagers who did survive Freddy's nightmares were being held in a psych ward and were being given drugs that did not allow them to dream (meaning they could not dream about Freddy and be killed). No one in the town knew about Freddy, except the older cops and the teens in the ward, so no one was afraid of Freddy, that's why he was unable to kill anyone. The ending was interesting.

The verdict:
I would not recommend Nightmare on Elm Street Parts 5-8 to everyone, I would however recommend part 7 to everyone. I would also recommend this seller to everyone because the DVDs were like new.",1340928000,,2857,4.369114877589454

3533678,4,B001DJLD0S,"These four film favorites pack are an excellent value for fans who want to own all the movies and buy them at a reasonable price. $10.99 for four movies is a very good deal, especially when you consider that a single individual Nightmare On Elm Street film is almost the same price as this four-in-one DVD. Put it this way, this is a cost-effective way of watching and owning the first four films in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, however you lose packaging (you could also buy the Nightmare On Elm Street collection, a complete series box set with individual discs if you're a more serious collector). Unless you really wish to own each film separately, this may be the best way to own all the Freddy movies. This four pack has two flipper discs DVDs with Dream Child (1989) and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) both on disc one, and Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003) are together on disc two. I know that these are considered the worst Nightmares but with this four film favorites DVD collection, I can still own them all for a reasonable price.

A second ""Four Film Favorites"" is also available which include Freddy 1-4 : A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984), Freddy's Revenge (1985), Dream Warriors (1987) and Dream Master (1988). This is a great way to own 5-8, however, these are the lesser Freddy movies, the ones that are a bit more cheesy, too funny and over the top. Fans usually don't like all the sequels and 5-8 are the ones that aren't remembered too fondly. I say for the value this is an excellent deal, four Nightmares film for this low price is convenient for a movie fan and collector like me. If you don't care about packaging and the flipper discs and just wish to save money, go ahead by all means. It's pretty obvious that some of the Nightmare films are better than others but we're not rating them individually, therefore collectively and with the cheap price this collection deserves a four for including the remaining four Freddy films for a good value. 4/5",1306022400,,2022,4.6011080332409975
3533679,5,B001DJLD0S,"If you're a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street Movies, you'll want to add this to your collection just for that alone. If you're gonna get 5-8, you should get 1-4 as well. I don't need to go into what the movie's are about.. I think everyone already knows that for the most part, but I'll still give my reviews on them in no particular order..

  #7) I will say I really really liked 'A new nightmare' because it's a movie within a movie. Everyone plays themselves instead of the characters they've played within the nightmare movies. It's basically the original cast from the 1st movie talking with Wes Craven (who also plays himself) about making a new nightmare movie. But ppl are really starting to have Freddy dreams including Robert Englund who plays Freddy.

  This is really starting to freak ppl out because they know Freddy is just a character. But it seems that as Wes Craven was writing the script for the new movie, he's somehow created a real Freddy who's much stronger, and much darker than the character that Robert Englund played. He's somehow unknowingly brought Freddy to life and this new Freddy that's been unearthed is going after everyone with a vengeance. It's a really smart movie and really different.

  #8.) Freddy vs jason is okay. It's actually not as cheesy as I thought it was going to be and you really find yourself starting to root for one or the other and have fun with it.

  #5) The dream child isn't that great but at least it picks up where it last left off to continue with the story and keep learning new things about freddy and his past.

  #6). Freddy's dead isn't too hot either but it's still part of the collection so ya gotta take the good with the bad. The positive is it also gives insight into Freddy's past and gives details that haven't been given before.
  Overall, it's great for any fan of the Freddy movies.",1303257600,,1864,4.5

3533683,3,B001DJLD0S,"If you've picked up the first 4-pack with Freddy's first four forays into the film world and enjoyed it enough, chances are you're here to pick up the next 4 installments. Unfortunately, what you're in for is two terrible films in the series before getting back to the good stuff. Once again, the transfers are crisp, the sound quality is excellent and the features are lacking, but to finish your Nightmare collection on-the-cheap, you really couldn't do much better (and, let's face it, a few of these installments aren't really worth the price of an individual purchase, but we'll get to that...) Now let's start with what this collection has to offer:

A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child - Typically, this film is ranked with Nightmare 2 as one of the worst of the series and, while it's my humble opinion that 2 really isn't that bad, I agree that 5 is pretty terrible. Picking up where part 4 left off, the premise of The Dream Child centers on Freddy's attempt to cause more trouble by invading the dreams of Alice's (Alice being the Dream Master from part 4) unborn child. While the concept certainly should have worked on paper, its flaws show through in the final film. The idea that Freddy can kill you via the dreams of an unborn child is intriguing and rife with possibilities, however far too much of the film seems uneven and it seems to take forever for the main characters to figure out what's going on. Not that you'll care too much for the main characters because most of the ones in this installment are fairly unlikable (except for Alice herself), so you're not really sad to see any of these people go. While previous installments seemed to pride themselves on the inventiveness and ingenuity of creative nightmares, it seems as though this film doesn't try very hard and there's no standout sequences. Even Freddy's make-up has changed (the result of David Miller taking over for Kevin Yeagher) and he looks more rubbery than organic, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of his horrible disfigurement. Stephen Hopkins directs this film in an overly-produced music video style and the film suffers greatly from no real sense of vision. In fact, the whole thing just makes you want to watch the previous four films and skip this installment altogether. To be brutally honest, you won't really miss much if you did skip this one... but then that leads us right to...

Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare - If part 5 wasn't your cup of tea, then get ready for the sheer absurdity that is part 6. Coming at a time when all of the studios thought it would be a good idea to kill off their franchise characters for the sake of a few extra bucks (""Friday the 13th"" attempted to finish things off for good not once, but twice.) What results is an uneven and ridiculous ""ending"" to the Nightmare series. Once again, we're subjected to obnoxious main characters that you can't wait to see dispatched all while exploring more of Freddy's history. While the Freddy history lesson is interesting to long-time fans, the rest of this film is just ridiculous on a level previously unheard of. Like part 5, this installment lacks creative nightmares and instead overdepends on making Freddy funny. Perhaps the most ridiculous nightmare is when Breckin Meyer is abducted into a video game world and Freddy dispatches him through a series of cartoony and totally silly traps (no, really, the cartoon sound effects are actually used in this segment. There's even a part where Breckin eats an apple and actually says: ""Super Spencer!"" At that point in the film, I've never wanted to kill a fictional character so badly before.) But it's not enough that his nightmare is silly, we also have to cut back to how he's acting in the real world as a result of his nightmare. At this point, any viewer worth their salt would throw up their hands at the utter stupidity being displayed on screen. Director Rachel Talalay (who performed a multitude of production duties for previous Nightmare installments) proves she's learned absolutely nothing over the course of her tenure with the Nightmare films and delivers a film that's just embarassing. Seriously, the last portion of the film was originally filmed in 3D and they actually had a character in the film put on 3D glasses (which was supposed to prompt the audience to put on their 3D glasses.) The 3D experience is not preserved on this presentation of the film, so you're stuck enduring several gags in 2D form. Last but not least, this sorry excuse for a film also tries to whip a little more supernatural mumbo jumbo on the viewer in an attempt to explain why Freddy can do what he can do. Y'see, when he was being burned up by the parents from the original film, he made a deal with some dream demons... No, wait, where are you going? I'm not making this up, it's in the film! Ah well, don't even bother with this nonsense. Like part 5, you're not missing much if you skip this film.

Wes Craven's New Nightmare - Craven returns to his original creation and attempts to erase the bad memories of the last two films by going meta with this film. This film-within-a-film-about-a-film takes the premise that the last 6 Freddy films were exactly that - just films. And now, in the real world, the evil essence that is Freddy is attempting to break free from his celluloid world and enter the real world proper. If it sounds confusing, don't worry - Craven actually does a good job spelling this all out for you in the film itself. Essentially, this is an excuse for Craven to make Freddy scary again and to revisit several of the elements that made the first film so popular (he literally refers to several moments from the original film and has them echo here in this installment.) Overall, the film is effective and Craven has, once again, created a high-concept premise for his film. The only real downside to the film is whether or not you enjoy the redesign of the Freddy costume and make-up and the bombastic film score that permeates this installment as though the composer takes the film much more seriously than he ought to. While it seems at times that Craven's script seems to pat Craven on the back in a total lack of humility, it is nice to see several cast members from previous installments appear as themselves in this film (Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, Tuesday Knight, Nick Corri) and we even have appearances from Wes himself. Altogether, this film is flawed in certain areas (particularly the thinly-veiled metaphor to Hansel and Gretel and Wes' own self-congratulatory script), but does the job erasing the stink of the last two installments off the franchise.

Freddy Vs. Jason - Finally. Together. And they actually do fight each other. For sheer fun in either the Friday the 13th series and the Nightmare series, it really doesn't get any better than this. The film really tries to attempt to satisfy both groups of fans and succeeds rather admirably (for a film that didn't do the same thing as well, see Alien Vs. Predator). The central conceit for this film is that Freddy's pissed no one remembers him anymore (thus depleting his power), so he recruits Jason Vorhees in the hopes that Jason's killing spree will convince people that it's actually Freddy who's back and killing again. It sounds silly, but really, who cares? It's just an excuse to get these characters up on screen at the same time. So, what makes this film different that I'm willing to write off certain story elements, even when they're at their silliest? Because this film knows what it is and doesn't attempt to be anything else. It's better than you'd expect and manages to capture the nuances of both series rather cleverly. Englund is better than ever in this installment and while it's a return to wisecracking Freddy, it's nice to see him back in the game one last time. Really the film is just a reward for the fans of slasher films from the 80's and if you've enjoyed Nightmare thusfar (or were a Jason fan), chances are you'll enjoy what they did here. This film doesn't really influence either series' continuity on the whole and it sort of plays out as a one-off or one-shot installment. At this point in either series, you might as well just sit back, have a few laughs and enjoy the ride one last time for both series before the reboots started.

In the end, this is definitely a 50/50 purchase (2 bad movies, 2 better movies), but if you're seriously considering purchasing this, then you're already a fan and you might as well finish your Nightmare collection. You should probably do yourself a favor and just skip the first disc entirely and go straight to the second disc for the 2 better films. Still, if you want an example of how not to make a Freddy film, feel free to watch the first disc. You'll probably be sorry you did. In the meantime, enjoy the last installments of one of the more creative horror franchises in recent memory and enjoy the trip...",1287187200,3,8950,4.690839694656488

3533689,4,B001DJLD0S,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5- I've read some reviews on this movie, and a lot of people don't like it. I honestly didn't think it was too bad! The night before graduation, Dan and Alice are having sex, then the nightmares begin again. Alice is in the shower, then she's transported to the asylum where Amanda Krueger was raped and where Freddy was born. (Robert Englund does another awesome job as Freddy Krueger!) If Alice can find Amanda in the real world, Freddy will die. Freddy is reborn and instead of haunting Alice's dreams, he haunts her unborn baby's dream, mixing reality and the real world. During her dreams, she sees her son, Jacob as a child, trying to help her stop Freddy. There was one cool part when Freddy is on a skateboard, coming after Alice's friend. A gross part for me was when Freddy is making Greta eat a lot of food at the 'rich-people' party her mom is having. Another friend, Yvonne tries to find Amanda while Alice tries to stop Freddy from haunting her child's dreams. If you love the Freddy series, and teenage pregnancies, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5: THE DREAM CHILD!!!

Freddy's Dead- After trying to kill Alice and her unborn baby, Freddy is back and trying to get in touch with his daughter! His daughter is now an adult and working as a psychiatrist. She tries to help rebellious teens with their problems. When she meets a guy who claims he doesn't know who he is, she takes him to Springwood so he'll remember something. Meanwhile, the teens go to an abandoned house to get away from things. I think it's kinda funny when Freddy is attacking a deaf kid in his dreams, and Freddy is right behind him trying to get his attention. I also like when they show Freddy in the past when he was a kid, then as a teenager, then before the parents burned him alive, and the demon worms pick him to do the thing he is best known for. Can Freddy's daughter put an end to him once and for all? If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE!!!

Wes Craven's New Nightmare- After The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven is having nightmares again, so he decides to write a new script. Beacuse the Nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to get Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a lot scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray! Heather decides to play Nancy one last time and kill Freddy...for good! If you love the Nightmare series, and a movie within a movie, you might like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE!!!

Freddy Vs. Jason- If you love A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, or both, you'll definitely love Freddy Vs. Jason! Freddy is trying to come back again, but since no one remembers him, he sends Jason Voorhees to Elm Street and kill to get people to remember. When Jason doesn't back down, Freddy gets pissed and have an all-out battle at Camp Crystal Lake. I love the awesome fighting sequences between them. I love all the blood and gore when they slash at each other! I remember seeing this with a friend when it first came out. There were some parts we laughed at, some we thought were cool.
