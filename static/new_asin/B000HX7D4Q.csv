8142057,5,B000HX7D4Q,"Bravo! Finally someone steps up to the corporate plate and screwballs a fast ONE into the strike zone. Well done: from the two corporate competitors, to the American behemoth coming into the equation, to the political despicables (the usual suspects), to the ju$tice system (not =), to the industrial spying with and without government(s) help, to the complicit monopoly medias - this does a lot in it's 2hr+ presentation.
Hopefully, the bar has been set.  It is a high ONE.
Realistic in that the corporate bottom line is heads above any concerns for humanity.
The documentary,""The Corporation"", is an excellent DVD as well.

Highly recommended!!!!
