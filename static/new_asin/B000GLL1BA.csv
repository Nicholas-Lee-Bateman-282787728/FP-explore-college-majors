I really got into the anime, when I bought them and almost watched the DVD's everyday. Fun fact, I met Masashi Kishimoto fact-to-face and spoke with him at the NYC comic con. I got his autograph and put it right next to the DVD's I got here, since they where the first official Naruto items I ever bought and owned.",1493942400,,423,4.170731707317073

8133392,5,B000GLL1BA,"I think Amazon shouldn't put the pictures of the actors on the page and say who their character was. The people who are the real characters are the ones I prefer to look at, not the voice over actors. I was really disappointed when I saw what the voice over of Sasuke and Naruto looked like. Seeing the actors makes you see that they're (the actors and actresses) normal people and I find that very disappointing, considering Naruto is the best manga and anime ever made!",1167350400,,471,4.488372093023256
8133393,1,B000GLL1BA,"The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you.",1164585600,8,636,4.535087719298246
