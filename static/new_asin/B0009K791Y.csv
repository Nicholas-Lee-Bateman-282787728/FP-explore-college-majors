8062276,5,B0009K791Y,"T'ai Chi is a great exercise.  It is easy to follow the movements of the instructor on this CD.  Great for stretching and movement.  It is good to do by yourself, better with others.",1351641600,,182,4.294117647058823
8062277,2,B0009K791Y,"It is not well explained.  and the slow motion is too exhausted to follow a long.
The flash does not help either.

The forms were ok.  that is the only worthy part of it",1316044800,,169,3.911764705882353
8062278,5,B0009K791Y,"I love it!
I like the way it is broken down to each movement so we can learn it more easily.
The narration (in English) helps alot also.",1284595200,,136,3.892857142857143
8062279,5,B0009K791Y,"One complaint many people have with Tai Ch'i DVDs is that the camera either faces the instructor (so you have to reverse the arm or leg and movement in question) or the camera view focused on the instructor's back -- while you can follow the direction, you can't see the detail of the movement being executed.  This DVD provides both views, plus a segment that shows each movement in slo-mo, as well as executed at regular speed.  The practitioner obviously knows his stuff, and the Chinese scenery background and music make for a fun and ""authentic"" experience.  I think you can learn the form in a week or so, if you analyze the moves and practice.  Of course, perfecting the form may take much longer!  The essential value of this DVD is getting you right into the form, without wasting time.  However, I don't know why it's so expensive -- when I bought mine thru Amazon 1.5 yrs ago, it was something like $25.00.  I can't recommend buying it at this price -- look elsewhere.",1265414400,,979,4.56
8062280,5,B0009K791Y,This is a great DVD for both beginner level as well advanced level.  This video does an excellent job of presenting the 24 forms. Each form is demonstrated from different angles to help the student learn each form. I highly recommend this video.,1143072000,10,245,4.6976744186046515
8062281,5,B0009K791Y,"This DVD (and companion audio disc) is very good for initiated beginners, and above, who want to learn the Chinese National Standard 24-Form.

The back angle and the slow-motion sections are good and useful, though the 'back' camera angle is better than the 'front' view, and has subtitles and English-language voice-over. The slow-motion angle has a very detailed English-language voice-over to help through the form. The front demonstration, despite being a little 'behind' the action and lacking voice-over, is the one I use most often. If I need to see a particular section again, I just grab the remote out of the waistband of my workout pants, where I've tucked it for easy access whilst I practice, and run the action back.

If you've never practiced Taiji before, pay special attention to the slow-motion sections, which explain the moves in much greater detail. It is still rather difficult to get best effect from a video, as it can't address the background and subtleties of the moves and postures in real depth, and cannot correct subtle errors. For instance; 'High,' 'Middle,' and 'Low' stances are mentioned, but are never explained.

Overall, the 24-Form is demonstrated on the DVD with clarity, excellent lighting, and with broad motions, making it very easy to observe and follow. The accurate and timely subtitles, along with voice-over, help you along. The subtitles have a couple distracting formatting errors, but after the first time or two through, you stop seeing them. The companion audio is a wonderful supplement, for when you're practicing away from a monitor, or don't want the visual distraction.

The best possible use of this DVD would be as a supplement to instruction by a knowledgeable Master.",1130112000,18,1728,5.095406360424028
8062282,5,B0009K791Y,"I am a Tai-Chi beginner. So many Tai-chi videoes in the market, but all demostrate the forms somehow differently though they all claim Yang-style. I am glad this is demestrated by a champion master. I found the video is very helpful. It demostrates all forms in different angles and especially in regular and slow speeds that is really helpful for me to follow. The DVD video quality is also great. Attending a class costs a quite lots. Just $20 for this, I absolutely recommend it!",1118620800,15,482,4.682352941176471
8062283,5,B0009K791Y,"This DVD is an excellent resource for anyone to learn

Tai Chi. It is a terrific comprehensive explanation

of: - how to move your hands and legs - how to improve

your body balance - how to execute each action. The

DVD gives a complete demo including front view and

back view. It also explains each 24 forms in detail

with still images. The background music makes me

relaxed and calm. I am glad to have such wonderful Tai

Chi DVD. I can learn the martial arts much faster and

better than I thought by paying only 20 dollars. Great

DVD!!!",1116806400,18,545,4.306930693069307
