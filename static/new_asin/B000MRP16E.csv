These documentaries do, however, make for an interesting supplement.  My gratitude to JD Johannes for creating them.",1210464000,,253,4.8604651162790695
8171446,2,B000MRP16E,"I like to support the cause, but I expected more. The fellow did not cover the departure or homecoming of his unit. If the unit saw action while in Iraq, it wasn't shown here.

The filmaker is back in Iraq, so we can hope that his next effort is better.",1177804800,2,253,4.06

8171448,5,B000MRP16E,"In addition to doing things most reporters typically wouldn't and couldn't do (e.g. accompanying troops on midnight raids and dangerous ride-alongs), the filmmaker tells a tale of the Iraq War that most here in the states don't get to see.

The soldiers seemed both realistic about their situation (it's dangerous and thus far from home in more ways than one) as well as believers in the cause.  Without saying so explicitly, Outside the Wire strongly suggests that the troops serving in Iraq know the real reason they're there, and that it affirms them.  It was also nice to see their personal and professional successes highlighted, from being invited into local homes for dinners to being welcomed home by respectful and appreciative family members (with none of the anti-war parades that confronted the Vietnam Veterans).

I really appreciated the documentary's fresh, immediate look into the reality of the everyday life of the Iraq War.  I look forward to any future efforts by Mr. Johannes.",1173225600,25,997,5.0920245398773005
8171449,2,B000MRP16E,"Its obvious the film maker is very sincere. But this isn't really much different from what has been shown on TV.

Bless him and his comrades, but other documentaries are better.",1171411200,3,177,4.709677419354839
