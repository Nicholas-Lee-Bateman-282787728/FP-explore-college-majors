8475536,4,B005J9ZE3A,"This video is another in the long list of very good instructional videos put out by Homespun Tapes.  Instructor James Nash does a very nice job demonstrating techniques to add spice and diversity to your acoustic guitar playing.  He presents the material in a very informal, easy-to-follow manner. He also uses snippets from some familiar rock songs/performers that are helpful in explaining the techniques.  This video is for someone who is at least an intermediate level player.  A beginner would likely have difficulty here.  The video is appropriately rated at skill level 3 by Homespun, which essentially covers intermediate or beyond intermediate players.  Check out a brief video of this DVD on Homespun's web page.",1336694400,4,722,5.234782608695652
