8726104,1,B012EHJ4HG,Although I like Werewolf movies this isn't one worth watching. Now if it was set in one location and limit the flash backs for the back stories then got better actors and script then maybe I might've liked it more.,1487289600,,214,4.375
8726105,2,B012EHJ4HG,Pure unadulterated garbage. I had no idea what this movie wanted to be but it didn't make it on any level. I made it for 45 minutes and then fell into some kind of coma. Pass!,1455926400,,175,3.888888888888889
8726106,5,B012EHJ4HG,I'm very happy with this DVD and how the quality came out. Wish they had blu rays but still happy with everything.,1445904000,,114,4.2272727272727275
