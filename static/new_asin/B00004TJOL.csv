7922799,3,B00004TJOL,"I only gave this three stars because it did not contain instructions for the Crazy Signs, or for the Aga Dou dance -- two of the essential Club Med terpsichorean staples.  Even though the different Club Med villages have different theme songs (Playa Blanca is the best and catchiest), the Crazy Signs are the same everywhere and they warrant some documented instruction.  Aga Dou is probably fading away, it has been phased out at several villages (as has the Duck Dance).  Playa Blanca was the best, even if the drive from the airport took 75 minutes and the village is very small.  We went back in the kitchen one night to watch the cooking crew at work, and it reminded me of the guys shoveling coal into the furnaces in the film ""Titanic"" -- a pure sweat shop.",1093305600,2,764,4.5144927536231885
