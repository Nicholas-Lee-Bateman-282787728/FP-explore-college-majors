8021988,4,B000246SXM,"This DVD concentrates defending against handgun threats. There is one technique for defending against a long gun as an DVD extra, but otherwise all the techniques concentrate on handguns. At the film they mention that they are producing more films in the future that include also defences against long gun threats. As in the previous films, this film starts with 15 minute long introduction, in which they tell principles of gun disarming techniques, give very brief instruction on differences between pistol and revolver, and give some advise on safe practise with firearms.

With some techniques, there is a chapter titled ""tactical considerations"", in which they discuss tactics associated with given technique. In these chapters they tell some basic principles of combat, but I feel these principles would have been better included into the first (introduction) tape. That way, the intro tape would have included some worthwhile information, and the information would have been presented before any of the techniques.

This film includes fewer techniques than other films. But in the other hand, the instruction in more detailed than in other films. On the downside, they instruct hitting to the head with a closed fist in just about every technique. This is not very good thing, especially if you are a police officer or armed citizen. If you first hit your adversary with a fist, breaking your trigger finger, then you cannot use your own firearm to protect you, even if the situation warranted it.
