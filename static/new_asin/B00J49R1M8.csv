Let me explain it to you so you can understand now imagine star trek being released on blu ray and fans complaining and  whining ""why is this fullscreen why isn't this widescreen ?"" Huh that's because when star trek was made for tv they weren't no widescreen TV's but we can make it widescreen if you want but we have to cut everyone's heads off ! is that ok with you ? And the true fans and purist would have said heck no  ! but a lot of dbz fans are ignorant unlike star trek fans and buy this garbage and that's why funimation cancelled the dbz levels blurays release cuz they were fullscreen
and the  ignorant dbz fans don't like seeing there widescreen TV's not fill the whole screen!! That's because it's not suppose !!",1469664000,,809,4.344370860927152

I really don't think the cropped image is all that noticeable unless you are trying to directly compare it to the original in 4:3 aspect ratio or if you just watched it very recently.

6333154,3,B00J49R1M8,"These releases are a step in the right direction, but NOT PERFECT. MY COMPLETELY UNBIASED review as a day 1 DBZ fan is, EYE do not mind the way the cropping was handled in these new Blu Ray sets AT ALL, they did a great job. Nor do I mind the 16:9 aspect ratio. I prefer that vs. The grain and black bars on the sides of your widescreen TV you'd get with the Dragon Boxes. Due to them being presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio. That being said, I advise holding off on purchasing these new Blu Ray sets mainly because the ""Season 6"" release is the only release that is presented EXACTLY how all the new Blu Ray releases should have been. Fans should take to Twitter and other outlets you can contact Funimation, and bring these issues to their attention. Ones that mainly exist in seasons 3, and 5, where the colors weren't handled well at all, also some scenes being too bright, and the Green contrast that exists in season 5. I would demand seasons 1-5 be remastered the same way season 6 was; being the sound, picture, color detail etc. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT in the new Season 6 Blu Ray release. LET FUNIMATION KNOW!!!",1410393600,,1119,4.358851674641149

6333158,3,B00J49R1M8,The sets are great but the value diminishes with each season up to this one. With each season that releases the price increases while the episodes become fewer. Season 5 has been the most expensive one yet costing around $35 until recently while it has the fewest episodes yet with only 26 compared to season 1 which has 39 and since release has only cost $16. I still recommend these sets but that's something to keep in mind.,1408579200,2,427,4.487179487179487

30% of the image is CUT OFF. The animators INTENDED to have the show 4:3 NOT 16:9. You're a sheep. You buy buy buy and you have no idea what you're missing. YOU NEVER REMOVE GRAIN from an old show. Removing grain destroys the picture quality. Everything looks like water paint. This IS NOT a good product of ""great quality"". It's complete garbage.",1405555200,7,402,4.4324324324324325
