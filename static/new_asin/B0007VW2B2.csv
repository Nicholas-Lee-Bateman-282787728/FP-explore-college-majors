8052435,5,B0007VW2B2,I've been playing guitar for 12 years now..flamenco guitar is one of the hardest techniques to find information about. I love this DVD because it shows you right hand techniques..which I think is one of the most important things about flamenco guitar.its hard to read the tabs on the screen..besides that it a great DVD it will put you in the right direction.,1351728000,,359,4.714285714285714
8052436,3,B0007VW2B2,"well, this lesson dvd does a decent job of teaching flamenco guitar. i do not consider his playing to be outstanding, but whatever he puts across is sensible. anyway, i've been playing spanish guitar for a couple of years & i knew most of the techniques. this dvd kind of helped me brush up whatever i'm playing & helped me to approach my playing in a more orderly fashion. unfortunately, i didn't get the most important thing i was hoping for: i wanted to know if there was a secret to playing super fast picado runs like paco de lucia. there is a section on picado in vol2, but he just covers  it up in a summary never delving into the deeper/faster aspects. as i said, i knew most of the techniques covered here & i was hoping that this dvd would help me take it to the next level. that,sadly, didn't happen. i guess the dvd is aimed at a mediocre level guitarist.
anyway, the positives :
1. pretty good explanation of the techniques
2. nice camera angles to understand clearly.
3. good selection of pieces/compositions are presented.

negatives:
1.he doesnt speak in a natural manner, but shouts in a robotic manner. i guess hes not very good at english.
2.he never delves into the emotional aspect of flamenco or about the deeper feelings in the music. the whole dvd is centered only around the physical movements of playing. ok, maybe there wasn't enough time to put that in the dvd, but some aspects of aesthetic appreciation of flamenco would have definitely been welcome.",1296604800,,1480,4.581132075471698
8052437,5,B0007VW2B2,the last comment was correct in stating that the on screen tabs are difficult to read but the folks at Flamenco Guitar Method have updated their site with a tab reader for viewing on your computer. very clear and usefull. superrrr reccomended!!!,1146441600,,245,4.857142857142857
8052438,5,B0007VW2B2,"Right Mr. darryl summers - but let's mention that a Score 'n Tab Viewer for the DVDs (if you own) is available on Graf-Martinez' site for free download.

Each DVD is divided into sections. In the first one covers the `rasgueado' and many of its variations. The second one covers the `pulgar' and variations on it. In the third talks about the golpe. I have found all of these covered on the internet beforehand but not in such length and not with such clear pictures. The second DVD is concerned with arpeggios, compas (time), and examples of songs.

The Graf-Martinez Flamenco Guitar Method must rank as one of the best self-tuition resources on the market and whether you are student or teacher of flamenco guitar, his new DVDs are an excellent companion to this. Recommended.

I will give 5 stars and congratulate Mr. Graf-Martinez for achieving such a marvelous instructional series.",1116028800,6,887,4.860927152317881
8052439,2,B0007VW2B2,"these dvd's are what they say they are except the on screen tab is completely unreadable. forget what the description says, if you purchase the ntsc version you will not be able to read the tab (i cannot speak for the pal version), however the standard notation is legible albeit difficult. so unless you want to try and mimic whats being played by ear and looking at his hands or you can sight read, don't buy or buy the book as well (expensive). apparently all the exercises on the dvd are transcribed in the flamenco guitar method books. so you really need to buy the dvd and book together if you want to utilise the material in an enjoyable and hassle free manner. personally i think it a tad unscrupulous to provide no warning of this or a booklet containing the exercises in tab format to accompany the dvd. it's a shame because i would have given five stars otherwise for everything else is great.",1113436800,6,904,4.484848484848484
