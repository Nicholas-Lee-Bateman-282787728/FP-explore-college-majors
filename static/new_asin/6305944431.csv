8287710,1,6305944431,"The recording of this concert is deeply disappointing:  The sound quality is muddy and thin, much poorer in fact than that of any professionally made CD I own.  Art lovers will also be less than fully satisfied.  While there are some shots of the splendid art and architecture of the Basicila S. Maria, more attention was lavished on depicting Mr. Gorbachov and other notable guests.",1089417600,,383,4.861538461538461
