4980569,5,B0069R2326,"I can not SAY ENOUGH about this series. I was really looking for a curriculum that my 12 yr. old and 8 yr. old could enjoy together, but this is something even my husband and I enjoy too!

We have 1-10 now and are ordering the rest. This is something we watch as a family and discuss it as part of our weekly family bible study. It has facts and history that my husband and I (both 'church kids', and I am a PK) haven't even heard before.

I am most impressed at how it gives the great overview of covenant, showing what even most adults don't see, the thread that runs through the entire bible from sin to salvation. We just finished the first New Testament DVD #10 and can not wait to get to the others. My only worry is that we are catching up to the series and will have to wait for others to come out. =)

4980572,5,B0069R2326,"The whole ""What's in the Bible?"" series tackles tough questions that even adults might have, but in a way easily grasped by children.  I want to show it to my group of university students when they come for our monthly dinner meetings.  And the Bentley Brothers are great!

4980583,5,B0069R2326,"This series is creative, informative and fun!  Unlike Veggie Tales which were animated, Phil Vischer uses puppets to tell the stories.  Each volume covers one or more book of the Bible by telling what happened and providing context that describes how it relates to the rest of the Bible and other chapters.  The background on the book from a theology standpoint is so informative and interesting - even adults learn something!  Fabulous for ages 5 and up!",1459209600,2,455,4.87012987012987

4980592,4,B0069R2326,"A Nation Divided.  No, we aren't talking about American politics.  Instead, it's the 6th volume in What's in the Bible? a DVD series from Phil Vischer, creator of VeggieTales.  As he continues his broad strokes survey through the Bible, we've reached the period of history in which Israel was divided into two kingdoms.  As always, Phil and his puppets entertain while teaching us some important lessons.

All the videos in this series feature a variety of Muppet like Puppets that Phil uses to entertain while still teaching about the Bible.  There are two half hour segments here that really flow together.  In fact, I have a hard time remembering exactly where they were broken.  Phil himself appears on screen at times, usually when an important point has to be made.  Most of the lesson itself is taught by Sunday School Lady and her magic flannel graph.  In other news, Ian and Clive get out of the jungle and sing songs from a biplane while Pirate Pete tries to get in on the act.  And reporter Buck Denver actually gets into his role as reporter.

Behind all the silliness from the various puppets, there is plenty of Bible knowledge imparted.  As with the other videos in the series, very few Bible stories are retold point blank, although Ian does get a new favorite Bible story.  Anyway, the purpose of these videos is to give a broad overview of the Bible and point out the important parts of God's redemption plan contained here.  The books of the Bible included in this video are Kings and Chronicles, and those include lots of kings.  All of them are mentioned, although very little detail is given about each of their reigns.  We do get a little bit about Ahab, Jezebel, Elijah, and Elisha, but again it's minimal.

Instead, the video shows us how the people of Israel continually turned their back on God and how God used Assyria and Babylon to judge the sin in the nations as a result.  It's a sober lesson in the consequences of sin.

These videos build on each other, as Phil and the characters make reference to things that we have already learned.  Yes, they do offer some brief explanations and definitions, but it really is best to watch them in order.

Of course, that does bring up my only real complaint with the videos, it seems like the jokes are becoming familiar and a bit repetitive.  Likewise, the songs seemed especially corny this time around.  Even so, I did laugh a few times in the hour and was entertained most of the time.

So that the show doesn't end on quite the downer, they do bring in God's prophecy through Isaiah of the coming Messiah followed by a choir of puppets doing one song from Handel's Messiah.  (I bet this is the first time puppets have ever done that.)  I find it interesting since the prophecy, while taking place chronologically during the time recorded here, doesn't happen in any of the books discussed.  And Isaiah isn't the next book in line, either.  Complaint aside, it does make for a more hopeful ending than we would have gotten.

Volume six of What's in the Bible? has the normal mix of humor and important Biblical truth.  While a bit predictable, A Nation Divided does a good job of tackling a serious message.",1429660800,,3184,4.612099644128114

4980598,5,B0069R2326,"Each episode begins with Michael, the king of the mini-van, watching this series on his way to Grandmas house. All these videos are connected together.

At the beginning of Episode 2, Michael talks to his never-seen brother Pierre regarding the Land of the Unicorns in the Bubblegum Forest. In all episodes, after Michael there is some other puppet banter, then the theme song, with the puppets in their cartoon space ships.

Inventive, imaginative, with colorful scenes that rapidly change back and forth as different puppets take the floor.

Volume 6 in the ""What's in the Bible?"" series covers the books of 1st and 2nd Kings, and 1st and 2nd Chronicles.

God had given His people rules to live by and had told them what the consequences would be if they followed other gods. These books covered in Volume 6 tell how the kingdom that once was Davids became divided. It deals well with word definitions, and keeping things in context.

The Bible is about Gods Rescue Plan, and this volume continues the generally excellent Whats in the Bible? series.

The people's apostasy, turning away to other gods. Jezebel. Elijah. The Prophets of Baal. The attempt to end the Davidic covenant meant to rescue us. All that and more is creatively covered in this excellent DVD.",1418342400,,1265,4.8604651162790695

8495388,5,B0069R2326,"I love all the information packed into these DVDs.  Some of the things the kids are learning are things that many adults never learn.  It's a great tool for teaching kids (and adults) about the Bible.  The kids consider it funny, love the songs and characters, and like that I'm using it as part of their Homeschool Bible class this year.  It has to be viewed multiple times for it to really sink in (since it packs so much information in some episodes) but that's ok.  It make for good conversations and teaching.  I extend the learning with hands on activities in our Bible Interactive Notebook.  Just have a few more DVDs to acquire and watch.  One improvement that could be made is to have the characters speak more slowly.  The content is hard so slowing it down would be great.  Younger kids may not understand the content but will with time.",1502755200,,848,4.519736842105263

I knew they would be great, because Phil Vischer does a phenomenal job reaching kids, capturing their attention and speaking truth into their little minds. These are fun episodes, with an amazing amount of solid, Biblical teaching in chronological order, through the Bible. The content is factual, according to God's word. The Bible stories are not subjected to opinion, just good old Bible facts and truth! The characters are fun .... I love the Sunday School Lady, and my son loves all of the characters. My son has learned so much from watching these. I'm thrilled! will be buying the remaining volumes, and I look forward to seeing them.",1490486400,,676,4.836206896551724
