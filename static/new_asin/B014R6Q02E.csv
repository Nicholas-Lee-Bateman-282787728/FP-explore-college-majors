8731636,1,B014R6Q02E,I ordered this for my daughter and I selected new before I purchased it.  When I got the DVD the cover was broken and looked badly messed up.  And when I opened the case the DVD looked worn out.  The silver side looked like it had been left out in the heat to long and I guess the saler knew about how bad the DVD was so they put a bonus DVD with only two episodes of a different cartoon.  I was not satisfied at all and will never order again from this saler.  Go with another saler trust me.,1475884800,,493,3.89

8731639,5,B014R6Q02E,"My daughter is obsessed with Nick Jr. cartoons, especially Shimmer and Shine. She always wants to watch what she wants at that moment, but sometimes they are not on, and I can not find them on demand. This DVD was an answer to my toddler tantrum prayers. Gives her some variety. and we can watch it at anytime. I recommend this to any parent or grandparent with a Nickelodean addicted child.",1465948800,,391,4.52112676056338
