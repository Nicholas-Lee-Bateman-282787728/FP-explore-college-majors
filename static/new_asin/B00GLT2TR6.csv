6085644,5,B00GLT2TR6,"In the first episode of Season two, Lila tells a character that the beach at the China Beach R&R Center is closed as it's being swept for mines and we know we're in new territory of the show. In Season One, the Vietnam War was present but more of a backdrop. In Season Two of ""China Beach,"" the horrors of war are dealt with straight on as various characters face the reality it has on themselves and others.  So what's new in Season Two?  Well, Laurette the USO singer is gone and McMurphy (Dana Delany who won an Emmy for this season) has two new roommates: former Saigon weathergirl Airman Wayloo Marie Holmes and the memorable Pfc. Frankie Bunsen (played by the wonderful Nancy Giles.)  John Wells joined as a producer in Season Two and from the start, you can see his handiwork.  The season premiere two-parter moves fast, introducing characters and situations and disposing of others.  We learn more about the characters themselves- from Boonie's mysterious war injury to Becket's romance with a Vietnamese widow. Lila has been retrofitted from some mother hen character in Season One to tough Army brass and Cherry finds her voice.  The season also has some real surprises- a shocking death, the episode ""Vets"" where real-life Vietnam vets discuss their experiences during the war and McMurphy visiting home to a strange new world.  Season Two is top notch all the way.  It's funny and moving and sad.  They don't make them like this on network TV anymore.",1389139200,25,1463,4.75098814229249

6085665,5,B00GLT2TR6,Gift for my Vietnam Vet Dad.  He loves it! Dana does a good job showing how a combat nurse suffers right with the guys.  It hurts to see your guys coming back in all torn up.  You go the extra mile to help them.  This show puts that out there.  The only AW--- was a square parachute in that time period and some other small goofs but a great show.,1447286400,,347,3.9

6085690,5,B00GLT2TR6,"I only saw a few of these shows when they ran originally years ago. And caught a couple in re-runs somewhere along the line. But I was very impressed back then. So I was very glad to see it was issued to DVD - and with all the original music included. This is one of my favorite dramas of all time. A big fan now of Dana Delany and the rest of the cast. The producer and the writers went so far to make the characters and the story come alive. It does everything that MASH would have done if it could have taken the Vietnam war straight on, instead of only by analogy.
It is sad to see when a cast member leaves, or becomes a casualty, but so far they keep coming in with more. The atmosphere and the emotions ring so true.
I'm starting on Season 3 now.",1427414400,2,753,3.993377483443709

As one of the guys that served during the Vietnam War, I feel that I have a personal interest in this series, and remember watching it when it first aired back in the late 1980's.  Perhaps aging has helped me in sublimating some of the feelings I had back when I first watched the actors portraying the men and women who served with the 510th EVAC Hospital, but not all of those emotions are gone.  I served a bit north of China Beach, at a place called Phu Bai Combat Base, with an Aviation unit with a mission of locating and helping to eradicate NVA and Viet Cong forces.  Our unit didn't have many casualties (We did lose one aircraft and 5 men in 1971, and their remains have yet to be found.) but we were located near the 85th EVAC Hospital.  I met several of the Doctors and Nurses who did the same jobs as those portrayed in the China Beach series.  I have great respect and admiration for these fellow veterans, and the series, in my opinion, was quite accurate.  I know there are some naysayers around, but I knew these medical personnel, and finer representatives of those who served back then would be hard to find. In looking back nearly 43 years, I cannot say enough to show how much this series and those depicted in it, mean to me.  When visiting in Washington D.C., and going to ""The Wall"", I read the names of my friends on that black marble, and then visit the statue memorializing the nurses who served.  Although I am saddened by the names of those with whom I served, I find that my tears come more when looking at the nurse holding the wounded soldier.  I look forward to the availability of Seasons 3 & 4. After retiring from the Army in 1976, I worked with the Veterans Administration for 23 years as a Social Worker, trying to assist some of my own.  I will be back in D. C. next year, and I know I will have more tears falling.  I hope that those who served in the medical field in Vietnam are never forgotten for the things they did to alleviate the pain and suffering of our military, during that conflict..",1397001600,24,2142,4.311720698254364

6085765,5,B00GLT2TR6,"I LOVED China Beach from the first episode!  I knew many young men who were drafted, went and served their country in yet another unfortunate war.  Some lost limbs; others were scarred emotionally.  When they returned, they were mocked and treated very badly by a segment of so-called society.  China Beach showed the pathos and even the humor of the time.  The cast was fantastic.  The series is an absolute must-see for those who remembered the war and those who see it as only a ""footnote"" in history.",1396742400,,504,4.670454545454546

6085768,5,B00GLT2TR6,"It may be difficult to relate to China Beach for anyone who did not live in and experience the '60's whether in the U.S. Military or as a civilian. To enjoy China Beach it is useful to see also documentary film of the actual war itself and events of the 60's in the United States. If you lived in and experienced the '60's watching China Beach is a real look back feeling moment  of reflection of change occurring in the United States. The commentary from actual nurses/doctors who served in Vietnam gives credence to the China Beach TV series. To put the China Beach TV series in perspective it is necessary to be aware of the '60's music scene, the college scene, war protests, the ""free love"" & hippies happening, and the other  events of the '60's decade from start to conclusion as well as the  '70's  until the fall of Saigon and post war '70's years.",1396396800,,857,4.439490445859873

6085777,2,B00GLT2TR6,"China Beach was a ground-breaking series not just because it was an unapologetic view of war but centered on fully dimensional women.  Strong writing, beautiful imagery, and a sense of humor while showing the horrors of war.  The main cast is almost exclusively made up of characters who aren't on the front lines, but are nonetheless in a war zone, and there isn't a film that does a better job at telling the stories of that American experience than this television series.

If I was rating and reviewing this based on the content alone, it would be the highest rating possible.

Unfortunately, the quality of the DVDs is sub-par at best.  I expected a low-definition resolution and a lot of black on the screen because it was filmed we , and that's aside from the not including the  at best.  Season 2's DVDs play like something someone burned on their home computer. The first

6085784,5,B00GLT2TR6,"I did not watch China Beach when it first aired - the bitterness and divisiveness of the era was still a bit too fresh.  I'm not sure what prompted viewership but the show soon became a favorite.  Dana Delaney's acting range was amazing, with Michael Boatman's barely less distinguished  Robert Picardo was a tragicomedic foil for Delaney and Jeff Kober was, well, one very scary warrior.  I was not able to understand, much less accept, the presence of Marg Helgenberger's K.C. but her acting was (and is) superb as CSI fans can attest.  In fact, Delaney and Helgenberger combined in my very favorite episode when they were held captive underground by the Viet Cong.  As luck would have it, that was the first episode of the THIRD season.  Rest assured, I'll be among the first to purchase that DVD when it becomes available.  I will not be dissuaded, nor should you, by the disclaimer that some of the original footage was in less than sterling condition; I haven't noticed any audio or video problems.",1392422400,,1004,4.7298850574712645

This show lets us have a glimpse into the Hearts and Minds of all its characters who serve either in the medivac hospital unit at China Beach or the troops who pass through to or from the front lines. If you're thinking ""MASH"" think again. This show is short on laughs and long on realism. We see the war through the eyes of a NURSE LT COLLEEN McMURPHY played by Dana Delany, who I was deeply IN LOVE WITH back when the show was on. After the first couple of episodes I'm IN LOVE AGAIN. The characters are wonderful. A good example is the Donut Dolly named CHERRY. What a NAME for a girl in the 'NAM.  Well, Let me tell you something. After 25 years I still get a little angry and misty eyed when I think of what happened to HER. That's how much these characters meant to me back then.

So many movies and television shows at the time portrayed 'Nam vets as manic depressives or massively damaged individuals with no purpose and explosive tempers.  China Beach reminded us that there were American military women in the 'Nam and that all of us were people with real emotions, real dreams, real fears and the show reflected the incredible bond that so many of us built for the small sliver of time we were there.  The character development is outstanding and the show is realistic without being a gory blood-fest.  I intend to have the series complete before long and I can easily recommend it to anyone who is interested in the 'Nam or who took that strange ""walk in the park"".",1390176000,13,748,4.559701492537314
