3050043,5,B0010TDRP0,"Although quit differnt from the films. Blade the series does justice to its origins.

Based on the Films. Kirk ""Styky Fyngaz"" Jones playes a much more human and emotion showing Blade who is as always one his one man quest to Ash all Suckheads. With the hepl of him tech-savvy sidekick and a newly turned vampire as his inside source he goes after the most powerful vampire house from within.

Originaly on SpikeTV.It was Canceled after One season the series never got to finish its story and left many open doors. Kirk does an OK job but he shows to much emotion for an authentic Blade ""Wesley Syle"".",1197763200,7,600,4.546296296296297

3050059,4,B0010TDRP0,I have watch the first few episodes and I have to say it's great! It makes Blade seem more vulnerable but I like that. He doesn't do over the top karate. Even though the guy playing him shows more of a human side he still has his witty charm. I say it's worth viewing.,1428451200,,268,3.9814814814814814
3050060,5,B0010TDRP0,"i was so mad this series was cancelled.. it had so much promise IMO. sticky fingaz was awesome as blade, jill wagner was great in going back and forth w/ who she was loyal to, and nelson lee was my asian crush :) .. marcus and chase were awesomely evil and sexy as vamps too. i really wish we could've gotten better closure on the series instead of the cliffhanger we were left with in what ended up being the series finale..",1426204800,,425,4.195121951219512
3050061,5,B0010TDRP0,"Blade the series is awesome, if you grew up on the blade movies then you will love this season of blade....

there are however pros and cons...positive and negative...

positive--
Blade finaly has a tv show!!! couldn't get enough blade from the movies
pick up where the last blade movie left off
the actor is good who plays blade
gives a new storyline to blade that all fans are dying for!!!!!!!!

negative-
blade is bald!!
only 1 season
doesnt have whistlers daughter or the guy ryan reynolds played which is proly the worst part of alll to be honest.

Wesley Snipes has the PERFECT LOOK for Blade!!!! no doubt about that!!!! Just don't understand why they had to make him bald now!!! i hate how the tatoos look on his head with being bald, at least with the hair it all matched and lined up perfectly, stupidest idea was making blade bald....
It seems to pick off from where blade trinity left off....but there is no team lead by whistlers daughter to help blade..what happened to them?? where did they go after blade trinity??? they could have really made this series that much better by having whistlers daughter at least help blade as a team, ryan reynolds character would be a big plus too...

they should have gotten wesley snipes to play blade, this actor is good just not as good as wesley snipes...

considering the fact that when i was younger i would watch every new episode of this series when it came on tv and loved it!!!! and even wanted more like it was one of those tv shows you had to watch every week no matter what...then they cancel it outta no where....they could have made an awesome blade tv show here with like 12+ seasons!!!!! plus made tons of money while doing it!!!!! plus have tons of blade fans happy to the max!!!!!!
but instead they cancel it as if the blade movies never made a cent.....

the blade movies are some of the most popular movies of all time, you never see any blade movie in the list of ""worst comic book movies"" or something like that..that is because the blade movies were awesome and everyone loved it!!! even people that never even heard about blade before (like me) see the movie and love blade!!!!! then finally a tv show and they cancel it!!! so stupid!",1425859200,,2208,4.491271820448878

The writing is tight and never boring and the action is great. The gore and special effects are tops for their time and overall this is a great series to binge watch.

3050073,5,B0010TDRP0,"I really enjoyed this series and was really sad to find out there was only one season. I really wanted to see what happened with Marcus. The series detracted from the original Blade concept that all vampires were evil and made you start to feel sorry for them, that is probably why it was canceled. I really enjoyed it though.",1412553600,,326,4.45

3050075,4,B0010TDRP0,I love BLADE THE SERIES bought it last week from AMAZON my biggest problem with the series is the finale Blade just lets Marcus van Sciver go when he has him at his mercy  and than Marcus finds out Krista was working for Blade the whole time and presumably kills her. It was an excellent series until it just crapped out at the last episode. One of my favorite villians was Charlotte a heavyweight in THE HOUSE OF CHTHON she looked like a nine year old girl yet was one of the most ruthless vampire villians in the series even Marcus was afraid of her I also loved Detective Boone I loved how Marcus had Krista kill him because he was drawing to much attention to Marcus's operation by luring prostitutes to Marcus's warehouse and leaving them for vampire rejects who are Marcus's medical experiments to kill them just so he could take their money I liked how Boone busted out of Marcus's medical experiment while he was inside a vaccume sealed bag by breaking off one of his teeth I also liked how Boone tricked Chase and Marcus into thinking he was dead and just disappears even after Marcus sends avampire swat team after him I also loved the episode with the vamoire serial killer known as THE WHITE PRINCE I LOVE how Blade rips his jaw off AWESONE SERIES THAT JUST CRAPPED OUT,1409270400,,1281,4.451063829787234

3050079,5,B0010TDRP0,A great series for the Blade character.  A must have for Blade fans. Only wish they would've done another season.,1407974400,,113,4.65
3050080,3,B0010TDRP0,Decent show if you like the Blade series,1404864000,,40,4.125
3050081,4,B0010TDRP0,"Blade, the movie(s), it's not.  But, for television, it is certainly entertaining and very watchable...that is, if you like vampire-type shows.  As a well-written TV show should be, each episode has 'stand alone' elements as well elements of a season- long on-going theme.  As I absolutely love the movies, I hoped this series might outlive one season.  Having no idea what its ratings were, I can see only one reason why it was so short-lived - Kirk Jones!  This guy just cannot act!!!  His performances are about as stiff as they can get.  His voice is a monotone, making Blade seem like nothing more than a simple-minded thug!  In fact, if you have seen (and liked) the movies, Jones' Blade is an insult to the character. Too bad!
The rest of the cast and the writing are engaging and leave the viewer hoping for more.  Maybe, they can make the show again, but with somebody believable playing the lead role (sic,even I won't hold by breathe waiting for that one!)",1398470400,,967,4.641176470588236
3050082,5,B0010TDRP0,well I accually bought this for a friends and they love it I don't really watch this kind myself but did a little,1393804800,,113,3.9565217391304346
3050083,5,B0010TDRP0,"As a fan of the Blade movies, this series was a natural for me. Sticky Jones does a great job as Blade, maintaining much of the same flavor that Wesley Snipes did in the movies. The guy who plays Marcus Van Scyver is outstanding.
The only part that sucks is that it got cancelled after just one season. It left us with a moderate cliffhanger too.
Have watched it a few times, still love it!",1393459200,,390,4.213333333333333
3050084,5,B0010TDRP0,It was very good and the quality was excellent.  I bought not only the series but all the Blade DVDs and they are of course great,1393459200,,129,3.9615384615384617
3050085,3,B0010TDRP0,"Blade The Series does not compare to the movies. Wesley Snipes IS Blade. But Kirk Jones does a decent job, making his own version of blade. There's some nice action and humor. The story is interesting with a lot of twists. The acting is okay for the most part. The SFX aren't too great but that's what happens with a low-budget TV show I guess. I want another Blade movie but I'll watch this series until then. I liked it!",1392508800,,422,4.2875
3050086,5,B0010TDRP0,"This series was grossly underrated when it was on tv, it has everything from good vampires to bad vampires, and well Edward is not in it so maybe if you are into that stuff you should skip it ;)",1368835200,,194,4.0
3050087,4,B0010TDRP0,"Although not quite as good as the Wesley Snipes movies it still provides great action, good acting and an interesting plot",1366675200,,122,4.857142857142857
3050088,3,B0010TDRP0,"Great mini series though, much like the Soprano's, the last episode leaves you hanging.  Krista (played by Actress Jill Wagner) portrays a U.S. Military Combat Medic returning home from war only to find her brother murdered under mysterious circumstances.  During her investigation she discovers her brother's murder was perpetrated by a Vampire named Marcus, the leader of the evil House of Chthon.  She joins forces with Blade (played by Kirk Jones) and his Asian Sidekick to bring down Marcus and his Coven, but there plans are soon thereafter discovered by Marcus...and Krista is subsequently murdered and then resurrected, as a Full-Fledged Vampire.  Kirk does an outstanding job in the title role, though Wagner and the rest of the supporting staff certainly hold their own in each of their respective roles.  Blade is nonstop bloody action you don't want to miss!
*Normally a series of this quality would receive a 4 star rating from this reviewer, but like most people I believe a movie should have an end; and not make you try to figure out what the writers intended.  When you reach the end of the last episode, if you're anything like me, you'll ask yourself ""What the hell just happened?""  But nonetheless it is still one of the better miniseries I've viewed over the Years!",1362787200,3,1286,4.925925925925926
3050089,2,B0010TDRP0,Had high hopes for this show & it let me down. Week Lead actor!!!! Or perhaps bad directing. Bad writing & editing. Leaves you hanging at the end. I can't go on about how bad this series was anymore. Anyway this purchase was a waste of money for me & will trade in asap. Blade 1 & 2 were great!!!,1362268800,,296,3.95
3050090,4,B0010TDRP0,It was a cool show. Good follow up to the movies. The guy that played Blade was cool. Had a good group of peole in the cast. Good action and story. Only drawback it did not finish. It was cancelled. So the ending isa cliffhanger. Should have made a tv movie to finish it.,1361232000,,271,4.037037037037037
3050091,5,B0010TDRP0,"I've owned the Blade movies and even a sound track since the first one came out!  When I saw the series announced on TV I stuck my nose up at it and did not even try it.  When I caught an episode of it in late 2012, I was hooked right away.  it's actually a very good series if you can over look the fact that Wesley Snipes is not in it.",1358553600,,337,3.6527777777777777

3050093,5,B0010TDRP0,Blade was short lived and i have learned that it was to expensive to continue the series. they could of giving blade a better ending then they did. That was rude to end blade the way that they did. Never start anything that you can't finish. This is a adult series not for children to watch. Five stars from me!!! Blade fan all the way!! THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER FANTASTIC BUY ON AMAZON.COM!!! THIS IS FOR ANY BLADE FAN!!! I PAID 5.48 CAN'T BEAT THAT ANYWHERE TRY TOO!!!!,1355356800,,468,4.329545454545454

3050096,5,B0010TDRP0,"Every time I played this show for people, they always made comparisons to the old Wesley Snipes movies and dissed it, but let's face reality for a moment: No, this is not the Wesley Snipes movies and it's not supposed to be.

Kirk ""Sticky"" Jones, in my opinion, did a very good job as Blade, because the story was that strong. I really think, with a storyline this hot, Kirk Franklin would have done a great job as Blade.

The special effects were okay, compared to the big budget spectacles the movies were, but did I mention, THE STORYLINE WAS HOT!

So if you are looking for good fun, check this title out and put Wesley Snipes out of your mind for just one second and go with the story, because it is SMOKING!",1347667200,3,713,4.3059701492537314
3050097,5,B0010TDRP0,"I was 14 when this series came out and I remember sneaking and watching it in my room. I was/am totally in love the Marcus and Krista. To be honest (I'm going to get attacked for this) I've never been a Blade fan, Wesley always really creeped me out and I've never enjoyed the movies. I love the work put into the vampires on this show though, and I adore the Marcus/Krista relationship because I think it's highly complex. Marcus is in my top fav bad guys ever. I miss this show, I was so upset when I found out they quit making it. Seriously, if I had a genie, I'd make him bring this show back with it's original cast (I was furious to see Jill wasting her talent on wipeout!!!). I watch this series once or twice a year, and I miss it so much </3 .",1343865600,2,752,4.053691275167785

3050099,4,B0010TDRP0,"Important to note if buying this DO NOT also buy Blade: House of Chthon.  That is included in the complete series as the two part opener.  Moving on Fingaz is no Snipes.  But ther stories are strong.  The supporting cast is actually better than most of the movies. Except of course Kris Kristofferson, he's the man! BUt the series is far better than Blade Trinity, but not as good as the first two Blade movies.  Interesting side note, there are topless women in the tv show, but there were never any in the movies... odd.",1323302400,,522,4.4526315789473685
3050100,5,B0010TDRP0,"I started watching this show with only modest expectations.  I found the pilot to be only okay, but I decided to watch the series all the way through.  To my surprise it actually seemed to get better as the show went on.  There were a couple of self-contained sub plots which were wrapped up in the same episode but the main plots (there were more than one) ran through and each episode picked up exactly where the previous one left off.  Every episode (even the last one) had some sort of cliffhanger, and by the end I was disappointed that they didn't have more seasons.  With only a couple of exceptions, the most part the acting was very good.  A couple of plots were kind of flimsy, but overall it had a very solid set of plots with various individuals and factions competing with each other for their own interests.  At times it was predictable, but there were several surprises too (at least for me).  At times it seemed like it was a little too easy for people to get away with things, but that should be expected for something based on a comic book.  Overall I found it to be a lot of fun.",1313971200,,1098,4.317073170731708
3050101,5,B0010TDRP0,"I had seen all the Blade movies.  I had heard about the series being cancelled and I finally got a chance to buy it on dvd.  I was impressed by how good it was.  The special effects, the attention to detail, the action, the plotting and the acting.  This was a real good series, the quality was on a par with the movies.  It was nice that the series came to a finale that leaves the viewer fairly satisfied.  I'm still upset about how the ""V"" series ended.",1310947200,2,456,4.125
3050102,4,B0010TDRP0,"Finally got a chance to go back and see this entire series. Show was already going on the Spike Network, and I use the term Network very loosely with Spike, when I became aware of it.

Knew nothing of it at the time, and was very surprised Goyer was adapting it for a weekly television run. It was nice surprise though. I wasn't much of a fan of Blade in the comic book, always came across as corny to me, but became a fan after it was adapted to the big screen with Wesley Snipes. Filled my action and drama quotos very nicely.

Can't say that Sticky Fingers really compares to Snipes, or that this small screen take lives up to the big screen versions, but this was a nicely done and extremely well-written tv show. Filled with just enough action and tons of expense. Couldn't wait until the next shows I remember. The Trio of Blade/Krista/Chen worked seemlessly well together, with great Villians in lead villian Marcus/ young and old Charlotte/ undervalued Chase, plus FBI agent Collins to provide the human element I thought the feature films kind of lacked.

I was only going to watch a few shows at a time, but ended up watching the entire series again in like 2 days. Finally got to see the two-part pilot, which was much better than others here say it was IMHO. Maybe we watched different ones, because I thought they were both good and set up the premise very nicely.

Really wish ""Spike"" would have given this series a longer run. It's was by far the best thing they ever produced. I said at the time Spike would keep it since they only had so much wrestling and ultimate fighting they could show. Man was I wrong. Apparently Mixed-fighting re-runs are more lucrative than I thought. I digress though.

This is/was a great series. Well worth a look for anyone still interested, or newly interested. Get the entire series though, and not just the House Of Chthon versions, which doesn't do the series true justice.",1308096000,,1924,4.53314121037464
3050103,1,B0010TDRP0,"My wife recently bought both this and ""Blade: House of Chthon.""  First of all, be aware that ""House of Chthon"" is the pilot movie for the series and is included in the 4-disc set of the TV series, so there is no reason to buy the standalone ""Blade: House of Chthon"" disc if you're buying this boxed set.

Second, and possibly most important depending on your DVD player, we found that our main DVD player couldn't play Disc 1 of the set, although it could play the other three discs just fine.  Searching the Internet reveals that the ""Blade: House of Chthon"" DVD had an early version of a new copy-protection scheme that caused it to be unplayable on some players.  Apparently they used something similar on Disc 1 of this set -- in fact, they probably just stuck a different label on the same DVD and threw it in with the rest of the episodes.  Another DVD player was able to play the disc fine, as was my wife's computer.  As we haven't opened the standalone BHoC disc, I can't tell you whether it has the same special features, but the unreadability suggests that it's exactly the same disc.

Poor rating for quality control (apparently they couldn't fix the copy protection scheme in the three-plus years since it first came out) and for non-transparency (nowhere on the box does it say that it contains anything called ""Blade: House of Chthon"", and nowhere on the BHoC box does it say anything linking it with the series).  Bad marks for amazon.com as well -- not only do they not say on the catalog page that the boxed set contains BHoC, it recommends that those who buy the set also buy BHoC separately.",1293926400,4,1611,4.512027491408935
3050104,5,B0010TDRP0,"I didn't even know there was a Blade TV series and kind of came across this by accident and ordered it because I did like the movies.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Although none of the original actors from the movies was in the series, the actors were all good and the plot was original and after each episode I couldn't wait to see the next one.  And although the series only lasted two seasons, I believe, the last episode ended nicely and didn't leave you hanging, which I was afraid was going to happen.  All in all I was pleased I purchased it, and have since loaned it to my brother, who was also surprised to learn there was a series.  After watching it I wish the series had lasted longer.",1279411200,,702,4.287878787878788
3050105,4,B0010TDRP0,"If you try to follow a successful action movie with something that emphasises character, plot or mood over action, some fans will jump on you and kick the stuffing out of you. This makes TV adaptations especially risky, as the lower budget and longer timeframe mean you WILL be doing these unpopular things. This is why Blade the Series had low ratings and was cancelled. But there IS an audience for this series, who just weren't aware of the show at the time, due to its pure action image carrying over from the movies.

Fans of modern vampire stories really should seek this series out. They'll discover a deep story of feuding vampire clans (or ""houses""), conspiracies, double agents and dangerous relationships, supported by lots of interesting backstory for the various characters, and high quality production standards (I'd say this series looks better than the original movie, which admittedly had some weak CGI sequences). And there's still a high action quotient (high for TV, anyway), which IMO benefits from budget restrictions by looking more believable. Sensitive viewers should be warned there's some pretty nasty interpersonal violence towards the end of the series.

I can't in good conscience give the series five stars, because the series ends on a cliffhanger, and the pilot movie has a couple of weak moments.  On the other hand, there is a great story about Blade's old street gang coming after him, which also explains his tattoos. In a later arc, we find out more about his childhood, and meet his father (played by Shaft's Richard Roundtree!). One thing I like about the TV portrayal of Blade is that he doesn't seem so much like he needs to be ""cool"", as in the movies; with Jones playing him, he's just Bad (in a good way).

For comparison purposes, I would rank this series well above Moonlight and Blood Ties (two other little-known vampire shows), bearing in mind that Blade, unlike those shows, doesn't have a love story as its core. Blade's generally serious tone can't really be compared with True Blood or the Joss Whedon shows; Blade is grittier and grimmer all round. The vampire houses plot element was also employed in Kindred the Embraced, but that series, while innovative for its time, can't compete with any of the post-Buffy genre shows in terms of writing, acting and production.

4.5 stars, rounded down to 4.

(BTW, Blade fans might be interested to know there is also a Blade anime (with optional Japanese audio!). It's not great: the pace is generally plodding (except for the spectacular final episode), and Blade's eyes & lips look weird, but it's okay if you are into this sort of thing. I'd score it 2.5/5.)",1269216000,,2659,4.858719646799117

3050109,5,B0010TDRP0,"Although I am a big fan of the Blade trilogy, specially the first one, I was never convinced by Mr Snipes acting as the vampire slayer, I think that the roll was too big for him. Snipes looked always overacted and he felt like he was pushed to do something he did not like.  That said, I decided to give a try to the TV series after reading the reviews in Amazon.  For my surprise the TV series were extremely good, far better than expected.  I was stuck to my sit always wondering what was going to happen next.  The series are packed with a lot of action, some vampire romance and a lot of blood, not to mention that there were a couple of times when I jumped out of my sit because of the suspense and thrill.  I won't say the TV series were better than the trilogy movies but they could be as good as well and stand by themselves.  Mr Sticky Fingaz was a lot more convincing in the roll and he felt more linked to the rest of the cast specially Nelson Lee.  Marcus Van Sciver and Krista Starr are my favorite characters, but Charlotte and Chase are killing good too.  It's a pity that the series were canceled.  I wish they change their mind and decide to make a second season with the same cast.  I want more...  and one season was not enough... it left me with a sweet bloody tooth unsatisfied... begging for more",1246233600,2,1318,4.190476190476191
3050110,5,B0010TDRP0,"Being a fan of the Wesley Snipe Blade movies, I was looking forward to this series as a mild replacement. Guess what, I was pleasantly shocked at the ability of this show to surpass the movies as a true drama. The movies were flash and action, the series is plot, subversion and mental stimulation. Blade is portrayed by rap star Sticky Fingaz and he does an adequate job as the cold, distant and brooding vampire hunter. But this show is more about the character portrayed by the lovely Jill Wagner. She starts as a quiet observer and becomes a backbone of this drama. Her determination and drive help bring guts to the storyline. As Krista, she wants only to uncover the truth of her brother's sudden and mysterious death, but you can say she bites off more than she can chew. Krista is turned after being nibbled by House of Chthon leader, Marcus Van Skyver. She painfully agrees to act as Blade's spy and infiltrates the organization that is Chthon. She bites and scratches her way towards the top, while battling the differences between her goals and those of Blade. The storyline is intricate, involved and detailed. We get a glimpse into Blade's childhood and adolescent years, the workings of the vampire hierarchy and the unknown wars between humans and vampires. This series was cut off after only one season and it's all here in this set, including uncut and never before seen footage. Bonus features are numerous and interesting. Well written, acted, directed and produced. This is excellent entertainment that won't disappoint. 5 STARS",1235520000,15,1548,4.845283018867924
3050111,5,B0010TDRP0,"Blade: The Series is one of my favorite TV series ever! This was an outstanding series with excellent acting, a great storyline, believable drama, & exciting action. Jill Wagner was superb, and incredibly sexy, as newly turned vampire Krista Starr. Although Kirk ""Sticky"" Jones was no Wesley Snipes he really grows on you as the series progresses and does a good job of portraying Blade. This series deserved to continue it course into season 2 but unfortunately, as with many great series, it was canceled  rather than being allowed to reach its potential. My only complaint is that when season 1 ended it was written as a ""to be continued"" episode leaving the fate of all hanging in the unwritten episodes of season 2. This set includes all episodes ever aired (entire season 1). I highly recommend you buy this series, you will not be disappointed!",1229558400,3,851,4.828767123287672

3050113,4,B0010TDRP0,"When I first started watching the two hour pilot, a friend came over about an hour in so I stopped it (DVR) while he was over.  I wasn't impressed with that first hour and very nearly didn't start it again.  I'm glad I did, the second hour still wasn't great but it piqued my interest and had some twists I didn't expect.

It was enough to get me to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd ... and by about the 4th or 5th episode this show suddenly became the one show I was most looking forward to every week.

This was more due to Jill Wagner than Kirk Jones' Blade, and not just because she's hot (which she is).  She really stole the show.

Unfortunately the slow start killed it and it never recovered.

1 star off for the shaky first few episodes.",1224806400,4,753,4.151724137931034
3050114,3,B0010TDRP0,"The guy who plays Blade (Kirk Jones) doesn't do too bad a job.  He looks the part, but definitely isn't Wesley Snipes.  Snipes had the presence that really made the overacting just right, but this guy doesn't quite hit the mark. Jill Wagner is as annoying as all hell, but she's obviously there as eye candy.  You could make a drinking game out the number of times they find an excuse to show her in a state of undress...

Still, it's good to see that they didn't try to make it kiddie friendly and that's it definitely intended for an adult audience.  If they ever decide to kick off a second season, I would hit that as well.",1220745600,,627,4.279661016949152

3050116,4,B0010TDRP0,"another season WITHOUT ""Sticky fingaz"" as Blade!

Marcus Van Sciver did it for me with his Lex Luther-like villain portrayal. He was slick, smart, conniving and cool.

I didn't mind the girl, Krista being turned either and I found it interesting that she fell in love with Marcus, while trying to help Blade.

Chase made a great femme fatale and I was looking forward to seeing more of her. The series was cancelled to soon, as if Spike TV has so much more to show besides old CSI reruns and Ultimate Fighter episodes. *rolls eyes*

What this show didn't need was a ""hero"" who was a jerk. he was unnecessarily mean to people who were his friends. In the movies, Blade loved Whistler, his confidant and partner. That should have been shown in the relationship between Blade and Shen and it wasn't.

Also, Even Wesley Snipes knew when to pull back and show compassion and smile/joke a little. He wasn't ANGRY all the damn time. In the TV show, Blade was always mad!!!! Geez, lighten up a bit dude.

I think if they had had a better Blade, the TV series would still be running.",1214006400,3,1074,4.482051282051282
3050117,3,B0010TDRP0,"After getting mostly negative reviews from critics and most fans, Blade the Series ended after just 12 episodes.  New Line Home Entertainment is now bringing the complete series to fans in a four disc DVD set which includes the two-part pilot episode.  These episodes are extended and unrated so even if you saw them during their initial TV run, there will be new stuff to see.  More gore, profanity, as well as a bit of nudity.  Was the series really that bad?  Not really, there are actually some pretty good things to be found in the series.

Set in Detroit (and as a native, it's so nice to see my city once again portrayed as being strewn with garbage and abandoned cars) Blade faces off against the House of Cthon, one of several houses or clans of vampires.  Leading the house of Chthon is Marcus Van Scriver (Neil Jackson) a rather dapper, gentlemanly vampire.  In the pilot episode, former soldier Krista Starr (Jill Wagner) returns home from the service but the homecoming is bittersweet.  Her brother is murdered and she intends to find out who killed him.  This leads Jill to the discovery that her brother was a lackey and wannabe vampire. Eventually murdered by Marcus for getting a little too curious.  Jill also discovers there's a new street drug called ""Ash"" made from dead vampires that gives normal humans the powers of a vampire for a couple of hours.

Jill's investigations lead to her discovering the existence of vampires and meeting Blade.  She'll try to kill Marcus but is captured and bitten by Marcus.  Blade keeps her from turning full vamp by having her take the same drugs that he takes.  Jill works from the inside with Blade on the outside to bring down Marcus and the House of Chthon.

Let's start with the good...the series does have a lot of action and it's certainly never boring.  The fight choreography is well done and Blade comes up with some very clever ways to kill the enemy vampires.  Jill Wagner, perhaps best known for her frequent Lincoln Mercury commercials, is quite good as Krista Starr.  She's more than just a pretty face.  I also really enjoyed Bill Mondy as Detective Boone, a dirty cop who eventually is turned into a vampire himself.  He's just wickedly fun to watch!  There's also a great rivalry between Krista and fellow female vamp, Chase (Jessica Gower) who becomes jealous of Marcus' attraction to Jill.

Where Blade suffers is with the main character himself.  Wesley Snipes may not have the most range as an actor but compared to Sticky Fingaz he's Robert De Niro.  Sticky scowls his way through the entire series, hissing his lines and trying to be intimidating.  His dialog comes off as wooden and forced, partly because of the clichd scripting and partly because of his own lack of skill as an actor.  Now for all that the directors and producers claims that they love Sticky, they seemed to realize his limitations.  Sticky is not onscreen all the time and you go through long stretches in each episode without seeing him.

The other weakness of the series is making it all about Blade Vs. Marcus Van Scriver and his henchman.  I think I'd have preferred to see Blade traveling about, city-to-city, eliminating vampires along the way without him having a Lex Luthor-type archenemy.  It simplifies the series much too much.  The series had it's limitations but probably deserved a longer run.

Extras

Not a lot.  There is a solid documentary ""Turning Blade"" about the development of the show and the differences between the series and the films.  There are also two commentary tracks on the pilot episode, one from Director Peter O' Fallon and the other from writers David Goyer and Geoff Johns.",1213574400,4,3664,4.751188589540412
3050118,5,B0010TDRP0,"Love the show, it really dragged me into its subplots, however i think they could have put some more work into the dvds. My home made dvd's with ripped TiVo episodes were more interesting then this.",1210291200,,198,4.527777777777778
3050119,5,B0010TDRP0,"I recommend this item to any serious vampire fan...  Forget about Blade and his gadgets... there is a real vampire story behind it all !!! The Van Sciver and Starr Characters are very good built. Actually the series could have gone on without Blade himself (too drastic?).
The story behind it reminded me of ""The Kindred"" or ""Ultraviolet"" (the British show) with vampire clans or families or ""houses"" struggling with each other for power and survival... with us caught in the middle as by-standers or simply victims.
In the movies, the story around Blade is written to make him the hero or the most important figure, however here it is different. The story stands on its own, and makes Blade just another piece of the action.
I thank the producers and urge them to take the iniciative again... keep the story, the characters.... discard Blade if you are afraid of the hardcore fans out there...  Potential spin-off??... YES, PLEASE.",1209945600,4,932,4.855345911949685
3050120,5,B0010TDRP0,"A lot of series nowadays don't get the attention they should get. This is one of them.

As a vampire and comic maniac, seeing this series was a true delight. Unlike the movies it is aimed towards building a decent story; the movies were one big action scene. Not much story in that.

Not so in this series. It explores the different characters and gives depth to the vampiric world that Blade & co. live in. Quite a few times the question can be asked: ""how would I respond, if I was in their spot"". I love that.

Perhaps some will find the focus to be aimed at the cast; quite rightly so. Blade is a vehicle through which we are invited into the night. Not much else in my opinion; the support cast is far better than the actor that protrays the main character.

It's a sad thing to see good things like these being discarded. This had great potential.",1206662400,,853,4.279503105590062
3050121,5,B0010TDRP0,"I admit, I was one of the many who were SUPER skeptical about Blade getting his own show.  I generally hate movie to TV adaptations & this show didn't look to be any different.  It was with great reluctancy then that when given a copy of this box set that I actually checked it out.  The 1st couple episodes (AKA ""The House Of Chthon"" straight to video release)were pretty corny & the acting from pretty much the entire cast of likables was pretty horrendous.  You know what though, I realised that not only did I not hate it, but I was actually really intrigued to check out the next episode.  Sure enough, with every episode everything got better.  I even accepted ""Sticky Fingaz"" (remember him from the old 90's rap group Onyx? ""SLAM! Duh! Da! Da!"" :P) as a pretty good replacement for ol' Dr. Greenthumb Snipes.  You actually get alot more out of this than you would expect from a regular TV show.  In fact anything that you would find in a rated R movie, from cussing, f-bombs, nudity, blood, guts & gore, you'll find here too.  Not that any of that stuff is necassarily important (okay well the blood & gore kinda is with it being a vampire show & all), but it does go along way in making you feel right at home with the 3 other movies.  I'm not gonna lie & say that the effects and all are movie quality, but much better than most TV shows.  I have to say I think I actually like the series better than I liked the 3rd movie.  This is just one of those shows that completely sucks you in the more you watch of it.  I guarantee that if you watch just a couple episodes you'll be completely sucked in.  I really hope if enough people buy this set that maybe the show'll get picked up by another studio where it can get the recognition that it deserves cause this really is a great series worth watching.  This show would fit in perfectly on HBO or Showtime.  Not to mention the cliff hanger it ended with, all I gotta say is ""Newline, you better at least give us another movie to finish the story"".  Bottom line is that this is a show that I didn't expect, nor did I want to like but wound up being one of the better shows I've watched in a while.  I strongly recommend everyone that's ever even remotely been interested in Blade, vampires, or Sci-Fi even to check this series out, it's a buried treasure that deserves to be found.",1205971200,11,2336,4.28246013667426

I love the Hard Rock Theme Music even the ending rocked too. Some awesome vampirize effects as the same as Buffy & Angel... I'm so sick and tired that every time I get a great series they canceled it because they get down from the stupid ratings, I don't even know how to rate them not even know how to get the emails or phone numbers either... I'm so pissed off that they canceled it, even the writers are probably pissed too, I don't know why HBO wouldn't pick it up because it is Unrated with Blood & Gore, With Never-Before-Seen Footage Mostly Nudity (Beautiful Women I mean holy s**t like Bada Bing if you like The Sopranos). I love all vampire series like ""Moonlight"",  ""Dark Shadows The Revival"" but ""Blade The Series"" was the best if ever seen I just don't know why they never get enough time to unfold.. If they wanted to cancel it they should have gotten it with a bang instead of getting a cliffhanger!!!  At least finally Spike/New Line got all 12 Episodes Revamped with a GREAT Box Set and Artwork and will treasure them for ever..

I couldn't believe that it had to be cancelled because it got too expensive for Spike to produce. I wish it got picked up by someone else.

3050131,2,B0010TDRP0,"After a pretty successful trilogy of films starring Wesley Snipes (the first really being the beginning of the whole comic to film adaptation craze), Blade made the transition to television on Spike TV, courtesy of the films' writer David Goyer and comic scribe Geoff Johns.  The series finds Blade (now portrayed by Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones) and his partner Shen (Nelson Lee) coming to the aid of a Iraq War veteran (Jill Wagner, better known as the girl from the Mercury commercials) whose twin brother was a vampire familiar of powerful vamp Marcus Van Sciver(Neil Jackson), and was murdered because of something he knew.  All this leads to some revelations, flashbacks to Blade's past, and an inevitable showdown between Blade and Van Sciver; all of which really doesn't amount to much.  Don't get me wrong, there's a few moments of greatness to be found here, as Goyer attempts to weave a decent amount of the vampire world mythology he crafted in the very first film into the series' underbelly, but what really hurts Blade: The Series is Blade himself.  Kirk Jones looks the part, but his overacting and static dialogue delivery are more annoying than anything, and the same goes for a majority of the show's cast as well.  There's some solid amounts of nicely filmed action sequences, and hot women to boot (Wagner and the gorgeous Jessica Gower), but there just isn't enough here to make Blade: The Series worthwhile.  The series would end on a bit of a cliffhanger, as bad fan reaction and overall poor ratings would cause the show to get cancelled.  All in all, if you're a Blade fan, the series is worth a look if you missed it on TV, but otherwise, don't really bother.",1197936000,15,1684,4.766323024054983

3284558,5,B0010TDRP0,"Blade the series is awesome, if you grew up on the blade movies then you will love this season of blade....

there are however pros and cons...positive and negative...

positive--
Blade finaly has a tv show!!! couldn't get enough blade from the movies
pick up where the last blade movie left off
the actor is good who plays blade
gives a new storyline to blade that all fans are dying for!!!!!!!!

negative-
blade is bald!!
only 1 season
doesnt have whistlers daughter or the guy ryan reynolds played which is proly the worst part of alll to be honest.

Wesley Snipes has the PERFECT LOOK for Blade!!!! no doubt about that!!!! Just don't understand why they had to make him bald now!!! i hate how the tatoos look on his head with being bald, at least with the hair it all matched and lined up perfectly, stupidest idea was making blade bald....
It seems to pick off from where blade trinity left off....but there is no team lead by whistlers daughter to help blade..what happened to them?? where did they go after blade trinity??? they could have really made this series that much better by having whistlers daughter at least help blade as a team, ryan reynolds character would be a big plus too...

they should have gotten wesley snipes to play blade, this actor is good just not as good as wesley snipes...

considering the fact that when i was younger i would watch every new episode of this series when it came on tv and loved it!!!! and even wanted more like it was one of those tv shows you had to watch every week no matter what...then they cancel it outta no where....they could have made an awesome blade tv show here with like 12+ seasons!!!!! plus made tons of money while doing it!!!!! plus have tons of blade fans happy to the max!!!!!!
but instead they cancel it as if the blade movies never made a cent.....

the blade movies are some of the most popular movies of all time, you never see any blade movie in the list of ""worst comic book movies"" or something like that..that is because the blade movies were awesome and everyone loved it!!! even people that never even heard about blade before (like me) see the movie and love blade!!!!! then finally a tv show and they cancel it!!! so stupid!",1425859200,,2208,4.491271820448878

3284572,4,B0010TDRP0,I love BLADE THE SERIES bought it last week from AMAZON my biggest problem with the series is the finale Blade just lets Marcus van Sciver go when he has him at his mercy  and than Marcus finds out Krista was working for Blade the whole time and presumably kills her. It was an excellent series until it just crapped out at the last episode. One of my favorite villians was Charlotte a heavyweight in THE HOUSE OF CHTHON she looked like a nine year old girl yet was one of the most ruthless vampire villians in the series even Marcus was afraid of her I also loved Detective Boone I loved how Marcus had Krista kill him because he was drawing to much attention to Marcus's operation by luring prostitutes to Marcus's warehouse and leaving them for vampire rejects who are Marcus's medical experiments to kill them just so he could take their money I liked how Boone busted out of Marcus's medical experiment while he was inside a vaccume sealed bag by breaking off one of his teeth I also liked how Boone tricked Chase and Marcus into thinking he was dead and just disappears even after Marcus sends avampire swat team after him I also loved the episode with the vamoire serial killer known as THE WHITE PRINCE I LOVE how Blade rips his jaw off AWESONE SERIES THAT JUST CRAPPED OUT,1409270400,,1281,4.451063829787234

3284578,4,B0010TDRP0,"Blade, the movie(s), it's not.  But, for television, it is certainly entertaining and very watchable...that is, if you like vampire-type shows.  As a well-written TV show should be, each episode has 'stand alone' elements as well elements of a season- long on-going theme.  As I absolutely love the movies, I hoped this series might outlive one season.  Having no idea what its ratings were, I can see only one reason why it was so short-lived - Kirk Jones!  This guy just cannot act!!!  His performances are about as stiff as they can get.  His voice is a monotone, making Blade seem like nothing more than a simple-minded thug!  In fact, if you have seen (and liked) the movies, Jones' Blade is an insult to the character. Too bad!
The rest of the cast and the writing are engaging and leave the viewer hoping for more.  Maybe, they can make the show again, but with somebody believable playing the lead role (sic,even I won't hold by breathe waiting for that one!)",1398470400,,967,4.641176470588236

The only part that sucks is that it got cancelled after just one season. It left us with a moderate cliffhanger too.

3284585,3,B0010TDRP0,"Great mini series though, much like the Soprano's, the last episode leaves you hanging.  Krista (played by Actress Jill Wagner) portrays a U.S. Military Combat Medic returning home from war only to find her brother murdered under mysterious circumstances.  During her investigation she discovers her brother's murder was perpetrated by a Vampire named Marcus, the leader of the evil House of Chthon.  She joins forces with Blade (played by Kirk Jones) and his Asian Sidekick to bring down Marcus and his Coven, but there plans are soon thereafter discovered by Marcus...and Krista is subsequently murdered and then resurrected, as a Full-Fledged Vampire.  Kirk does an outstanding job in the title role, though Wagner and the rest of the supporting staff certainly hold their own in each of their respective roles.  Blade is nonstop bloody action you don't want to miss!
*Normally a series of this quality would receive a 4 star rating from this reviewer, but like most people I believe a movie should have an end; and not make you try to figure out what the writers intended.  When you reach the end of the last episode, if you're anything like me, you'll ask yourself ""What the hell just happened?""

Kirk ""Sticky"" Jones, in my opinion, did a very good job as Blade, because the story was that strong. I really think, with a storyline this hot, Kirk Franklin would have done a great job as Blade.

The special effects were okay, compared to the big budget spectacles the movies were, but did I mention, THE STORYLINE WAS HOT!

I love the work put into the vampires on this show though, and I adore the Marcus/Krista relationship because I think it's highly complex. Marcus is in my top fav bad guys ever.

To my surprise it actually seemed to get better as the show went on.  There were a couple of self-contained sub plots which were wrapped up in the same episode but the main plots (there were more than one) ran through and each episode picked up exactly where the previous one left off.  Every episode (even the last one) had some sort of cliffhanger, and by the end I was disappointed that they didn't have more seasons.  With only a couple of exceptions, the most part the acting was very good.  A couple of plots were kind of flimsy, but overall it had a very solid set of plots with various individuals and factions competing with each other for their own interests.  At times it was predictable, but there were several surprises too (at least for me).  At times it seemed like it was a little too easy for people to get away with things, but that should be expected for something based on a comic book.

It was nice that the series came to a finale that leaves the viewer fairly satisfied.  I'm still upset about how the ""V"" series ended.",1310947200,2,456,4.125
3284599,4,B0010TDRP0,"Finally got a chance to go back and see this entire series. Show was already going on the Spike Network, and I use the term Network very loosely with Spike, when I became aware of it.

Knew nothing of it at the time, and was very surprised Goyer was adapting it for a weekly television run. It was nice surprise though. I wasn't much of a fan of Blade in the comic book, always came across as corny to me, but became a fan after it was adapted to the big screen with Wesley Snipes. Filled my action and drama quotos very nicely.

Can't say that Sticky Fingers really compares to Snipes, or that this small screen take lives up to the big screen versions, but this was a nicely done and extremely well-written tv show. Filled with just enough action and tons of expense. Couldn't wait until the next shows I remember. The Trio of Blade/Krista/Chen worked seemlessly well together, with great Villians in lead villian Marcus/ young and old Charlotte/ undervalued Chase, plus FBI agent Collins to provide the human element I thought the feature films kind of lacked.

I was only going to watch a few shows at a time, but ended up watching the entire series again in like 2 days. Finally got to see the two-part pilot, which was much better than others here say it was IMHO. Maybe we watched different ones, because I thought they were both good and set up the premise very nicely.

Really wish ""Spike"" would have given this series a longer run. It's was by far the best thing they ever produced. I said at the time Spike would keep it since they only had so much wrestling and ultimate fighting they could show. Man was I wrong. Apparently Mixed-fighting re-runs are more lucrative than I thought. I digress though.

This is/was a great series. Well worth a look for anyone still interested, or newly interested. Get the entire series though, and not just the House Of Chthon versions, which doesn't do the series true justice.",1308096000,,1924,4.53314121037464
3284600,1,B0010TDRP0,"My wife recently bought both this and ""Blade: House of Chthon.""  First of all, be aware that ""House of Chthon"" is the pilot movie for the series and is included in the 4-disc set of the TV series, so there is no reason to buy the standalone ""Blade: House of Chthon"" disc if you're buying this boxed set.

Second, and possibly most important depending on your DVD player, we found that our main DVD player couldn't play Disc 1 of the set, although it could play the other three discs just fine.  Searching the Internet reveals that the ""Blade: House of Chthon"" DVD had an early version of a new copy-protection scheme that caused it to be unplayable on some players.  Apparently they used something similar on Disc 1 of this set -- in fact, they probably just stuck a different label on the same DVD and threw it in with the rest of the episodes.  Another DVD player was able to play the disc fine, as was my wife's computer.  As we haven't opened the standalone BHoC disc, I can't tell you whether it has the same special features, but the unreadability suggests that it's exactly the same disc.

Poor rating for quality control (apparently they couldn't fix the copy protection scheme in the three-plus years since it first came out) and for non-transparency (nowhere on the box does it say that it contains anything called ""Blade: House of Chthon"", and nowhere on the BHoC box does it say anything linking it with the series).  Bad marks for amazon.com as well -- not only do they not say on the catalog page that the boxed set contains BHoC, it recommends that those who buy the set also buy BHoC separately.",1293926400,4,1611,4.512027491408935

And although the series only lasted two seasons, I believe, the last episode ended nicely and didn't leave you hanging, which I was afraid was going to happen.  All in all I was pleased I purchased it, and have since loaned it to my brother, who was also surprised to learn there was a series.

3284602,4,B0010TDRP0,"If you try to follow a successful action movie with something that emphasises character, plot or mood over action, some fans will jump on you and kick the stuffing out of you. This makes TV adaptations especially risky, as the lower budget and longer timeframe mean you WILL be doing these unpopular things. This is why Blade the Series had low ratings and was cancelled. But there IS an audience for this series, who just weren't aware of the show at the time, due to its pure action image carrying over from the movies.

Fans of modern vampire stories really should seek this series out. They'll discover a deep story of feuding vampire clans (or ""houses""), conspiracies, double agents and dangerous relationships, supported by lots of interesting backstory for the various characters, and high quality production standards (I'd say this series looks better than the original movie, which admittedly had some weak CGI sequences). And there's still a high action quotient (high for TV, anyway), which IMO benefits from budget restrictions by looking more believable. Sensitive viewers should be warned there's some pretty nasty interpersonal violence towards the end of the series.

I can't in good conscience give the series five stars, because the series ends on a cliffhanger, and the pilot movie has a couple of weak moments.  On the other hand, there is a great story about Blade's old street gang coming after him, which also explains his tattoos. In a later arc, we find out more about his childhood, and meet his father (played by Shaft's Richard Roundtree!). One thing I like about the TV portrayal of Blade is that he doesn't seem so much like he needs to be ""cool"", as in the movies; with Jones playing him, he's just Bad (in a good way).

For comparison purposes, I would rank this series well above Moonlight and Blood Ties (two other little-known vampire shows), bearing in mind that Blade, unlike those shows, doesn't have a love story as its core. Blade's generally serious tone can't really be compared with True Blood or the Joss Whedon shows; Blade is grittier and grimmer all round. The vampire houses plot element was also employed in Kindred the Embraced, but that series, while innovative for its time, can't compete with any of the post-Buffy genre shows in terms of writing, acting and production.

4.5 stars, rounded down to 4.

(BTW, Blade fans might be interested to know there is also a Blade anime (with optional Japanese audio!). It's not great: the pace is generally plodding (except for the spectacular final episode), and Blade's eyes & lips look weird, but it's okay if you are into this sort of thing. I'd score it 2.5/5.)",1269216000,,2659,4.858719646799117

3284606,5,B0010TDRP0,"Although I am a big fan of the Blade trilogy, specially the first one, I was never convinced by Mr Snipes acting as the vampire slayer, I think that the roll was too big for him. Snipes looked always overacted and he felt like he was pushed to do something he did not like.  That said, I decided to give a try to the TV series after reading the reviews in Amazon.  For my surprise the TV series were extremely good, far better than expected.  I was stuck to my sit always wondering what was going to happen next.  The series are packed with a lot of action, some vampire romance and a lot of blood, not to mention that there were a couple of times when I jumped out of my sit because of the suspense and thrill.  I won't say the TV series were better than the trilogy movies but they could be as good as well and stand by themselves.  Mr Sticky Fingaz was a lot more convincing in the roll and he felt more linked to the rest of the cast specially Nelson Lee.  Marcus Van Sciver and Krista Starr are my favorite characters, but Charlotte and Chase are killing good too.  It's a pity that the series were canceled.  I wish they change their mind and decide to make a second season with the same cast.  I want more...  and one season was not enough... it left me with a sweet bloody tooth unsatisfied... begging for more",1246233600,2,1318,4.190476190476191
3284607,5,B0010TDRP0,"Being a fan of the Wesley Snipe Blade movies, I was looking forward to this series as a mild replacement. Guess what, I was pleasantly shocked at the ability of this show to surpass the movies as a true drama. The movies were flash and action, the series is plot, subversion and mental stimulation. Blade is portrayed by rap star Sticky Fingaz and he does an adequate job as the cold, distant and brooding vampire hunter. But this show is more about the character portrayed by the lovely Jill Wagner. She starts as a quiet observer and becomes a backbone of this drama. Her determination and drive help bring guts to the storyline. As Krista, she wants only to uncover the truth of her brother's sudden and mysterious death, but you can say she bites off more than she can chew. Krista is turned after being nibbled by House of Chthon leader, Marcus Van Skyver. She painfully agrees to act as Blade's spy and infiltrates the organization that is Chthon. She bites and scratches her way towards the top, while battling the differences between her goals and those of Blade. The storyline is intricate, involved and detailed. We get a glimpse into Blade's childhood and adolescent years, the workings of the vampire hierarchy and the unknown wars between humans and vampires. This series was cut off after only one season and it's all here in this set, including uncut and never before seen footage. Bonus features are numerous and interesting. Well written, acted, directed and produced. This is excellent entertainment that won't disappoint. 5 STARS",1235520000,15,1548,4.845283018867924
3284608,5,B0010TDRP0,"Blade: The Series is one of my favorite TV series ever! This was an outstanding series with excellent acting, a great storyline, believable drama, & exciting action. Jill Wagner was superb, and incredibly sexy, as newly turned vampire Krista Starr. Although Kirk ""Sticky"" Jones was no Wesley Snipes he really grows on you as the series progresses and does a good job of portraying Blade. This series deserved to continue it course into season 2 but unfortunately, as with many great series, it was canceled  rather than being allowed to reach its potential. My only complaint is that when season 1 ended it was written as a ""to be continued"" episode leaving the fate of all hanging in the unwritten episodes of season 2. This set includes all episodes ever aired (entire season 1). I highly recommend you buy this series, you will not be disappointed!",1229558400,3,851,4.828767123287672

3284610,4,B0010TDRP0,"When I first started watching the two hour pilot, a friend came over about an hour in so I stopped it (DVR) while he was over.  I wasn't impressed with that first hour and very nearly didn't start it again.  I'm glad I did, the second hour still wasn't great but it piqued my interest and had some twists I didn't expect.

It was enough to get me to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd ... and by about the 4th or 5th episode this show suddenly became the one show I was most looking forward to every week.

This was more due to Jill Wagner than Kirk Jones' Blade, and not just because she's hot (which she is).  She really stole the show.

Unfortunately the slow start killed it and it never recovered.

1 star off for the shaky first few episodes.",1224806400,4,753,4.151724137931034
3284611,3,B0010TDRP0,"The guy who plays Blade (Kirk Jones) doesn't do too bad a job.  He looks the part, but definitely isn't Wesley Snipes.  Snipes had the presence that really made the overacting just right, but this guy doesn't quite hit the mark. Jill Wagner is as annoying as all hell, but she's obviously there as eye candy.  You could make a drinking game out the number of times they find an excuse to show her in a state of undress...

Still, it's good to see that they didn't try to make it kiddie friendly and that's it definitely intended for an adult audience.  If they ever decide to kick off a second season, I would hit that as well.",1220745600,,627,4.279661016949152

3284613,4,B0010TDRP0,"another season WITHOUT ""Sticky fingaz"" as Blade!

Marcus Van Sciver did it for me with his Lex Luther-like villain portrayal. He was slick, smart, conniving and cool.

I didn't mind the girl, Krista being turned either and I found it interesting that she fell in love with Marcus, while trying to help Blade.

Chase made a great femme fatale and I was looking forward to seeing more of her. The series was cancelled to soon, as if Spike TV has so much more to show besides old CSI reruns and Ultimate Fighter episodes. *rolls eyes*

What this show didn't need was a ""hero"" who was a jerk. he was unnecessarily mean to people who were his friends. In the movies, Blade loved Whistler, his confidant and partner. That should have been shown in the relationship between Blade and Shen and it wasn't.

Also, Even Wesley Snipes knew when to pull back and show compassion and smile/joke a little. He wasn't ANGRY all the damn time. In the TV show, Blade was always mad!!!! Geez, lighten up a bit dude.

I think if they had had a better Blade, the TV series would still be running.",1214006400,3,1074,4.482051282051282
3284614,3,B0010TDRP0,"After getting mostly negative reviews from critics and most fans, Blade the Series ended after just 12 episodes.  New Line Home Entertainment is now bringing the complete series to fans in a four disc DVD set which includes the two-part pilot episode.  These episodes are extended and unrated so even if you saw them during their initial TV run, there will be new stuff to see.  More gore, profanity, as well as a bit of nudity.  Was the series really that bad?  Not really, there are actually some pretty good things to be found in the series.

Set in Detroit (and as a native, it's so nice to see my city once again portrayed as being strewn with garbage and abandoned cars) Blade faces off against the House of Cthon, one of several houses or clans of vampires.  Leading the house of Chthon is Marcus Van Scriver (Neil Jackson) a rather dapper, gentlemanly vampire.  In the pilot episode, former soldier Krista Starr (Jill Wagner) returns home from the service but the homecoming is bittersweet.  Her brother is murdered and she intends to find out who killed him.  This leads Jill to the discovery that her brother was a lackey and wannabe vampire. Eventually murdered by Marcus for getting a little too curious.  Jill also discovers there's a new street drug called ""Ash"" made from dead vampires that gives normal humans the powers of a vampire for a couple of hours.

Jill's investigations lead to her discovering the existence of vampires and meeting Blade.  She'll try to kill Marcus but is captured and bitten by Marcus.  Blade keeps her from turning full vamp by having her take the same drugs that he takes.  Jill works from the inside with Blade on the outside to bring down Marcus and the House of Chthon.

Let's start with the good...the series does have a lot of action and it's certainly never boring.  The fight choreography is well done and Blade comes up with some very clever ways to kill the enemy vampires.  Jill Wagner, perhaps best known for her frequent Lincoln Mercury commercials, is quite good as Krista Starr.  She's more than just a pretty face.  I also really enjoyed Bill Mondy as Detective Boone, a dirty cop who eventually is turned into a vampire himself.  He's just wickedly fun to watch!  There's also a great rivalry between Krista and fellow female vamp, Chase (Jessica Gower) who becomes jealous of Marcus' attraction to Jill.

Where Blade suffers is with the main character himself.  Wesley Snipes may not have the most range as an actor but compared to Sticky Fingaz he's Robert De Niro.  Sticky scowls his way through the entire series, hissing his lines and trying to be intimidating.  His dialog comes off as wooden and forced, partly because of the clichd scripting and partly because of his own lack of skill as an actor.  Now for all that the directors and producers claims that they love Sticky, they seemed to realize his limitations.  Sticky is not onscreen all the time and you go through long stretches in each episode without seeing him.

The other weakness of the series is making it all about Blade Vs. Marcus Van Scriver and his henchman.  I think I'd have preferred to see Blade traveling about, city-to-city, eliminating vampires along the way without him having a Lex Luthor-type archenemy.  It simplifies the series much too much.  The series had it's limitations but probably deserved a longer run.

Extras

Not a lot.  There is a solid documentary ""Turning Blade"" about the development of the show and the differences between the series and the films.  There are also two commentary tracks on the pilot episode, one from Director Peter O' Fallon and the other from writers David Goyer and Geoff Johns.",1213574400,4,3664,4.751188589540412
3284615,5,B0010TDRP0,"Love the show, it really dragged me into its subplots, however i think they could have put some more work into the dvds. My home made dvd's with ripped TiVo episodes were more interesting then this.",1210291200,,198,4.527777777777778
3284616,5,B0010TDRP0,"I recommend this item to any serious vampire fan...  Forget about Blade and his gadgets... there is a real vampire story behind it all !!! The Van Sciver and Starr Characters are very good built. Actually the series could have gone on without Blade himself (too drastic?).
The story behind it reminded me of ""The Kindred"" or ""Ultraviolet"" (the British show) with vampire clans or families or ""houses"" struggling with each other for power and survival... with us caught in the middle as by-standers or simply victims.
In the movies, the story around Blade is written to make him the hero or the most important figure, however here it is different. The story stands on its own, and makes Blade just another piece of the action.
I thank the producers and urge them to take the iniciative again... keep the story, the characters.... discard Blade if you are afraid of the hardcore fans out there...  Potential spin-off??... YES, PLEASE.",1209945600,4,932,4.855345911949685
3284617,5,B0010TDRP0,"A lot of series nowadays don't get the attention they should get. This is one of them.

As a vampire and comic maniac, seeing this series was a true delight. Unlike the movies it is aimed towards building a decent story; the movies were one big action scene. Not much story in that.

Not so in this series. It explores the different characters and gives depth to the vampiric world that Blade & co. live in. Quite a few times the question can be asked: ""how would I respond, if I was in their spot"". I love that.

Perhaps some will find the focus to be aimed at the cast; quite rightly so. Blade is a vehicle through which we are invited into the night. Not much else in my opinion; the support cast is far better than the actor that protrays the main character.

It's a sad thing to see good things like these being discarded. This had great potential.",1206662400,,853,4.279503105590062
3284618,5,B0010TDRP0,"I admit, I was one of the many who were SUPER skeptical about Blade getting his own show.  I generally hate movie to TV adaptations & this show didn't look to be any different.  It was with great reluctancy then that when given a copy of this box set that I actually checked it out.  The 1st couple episodes (AKA ""The House Of Chthon"" straight to video release)were pretty corny & the acting from pretty much the entire cast of likables was pretty horrendous.  You know what though, I realised that not only did I not hate it, but I was actually really intrigued to check out the next episode.  Sure enough, with every episode everything got better.  I even accepted ""Sticky Fingaz"" (remember him from the old 90's rap group Onyx? ""SLAM! Duh! Da! Da!"" :P) as a pretty good replacement for ol' Dr. Greenthumb Snipes.  You actually get alot more out of this than you would expect from a regular TV show.  In fact anything that you would find in a rated R movie, from cussing, f-bombs, nudity, blood, guts & gore, you'll find here too.  Not that any of that stuff is necassarily important (okay well the blood & gore kinda is with it being a vampire show & all), but it does go along way in making you feel right at home with the 3 other movies.  I'm not gonna lie & say that the effects and all are movie quality, but much better than most TV shows.  I have to say I think I actually like the series better than I liked the 3rd movie.  This is just one of those shows that completely sucks you in the more you watch of it.  I guarantee that if you watch just a couple episodes you'll be completely sucked in.  I really hope if enough people buy this set that maybe the show'll get picked up by another studio where it can get the recognition that it deserves cause this really is a great series worth watching.  This show would fit in perfectly on HBO or Showtime.  Not to mention the cliff hanger it ended with, all I gotta say is ""Newline, you better at least give us another movie to finish the story"".  Bottom line is that this is a show that I didn't expect, nor did I want to like but wound up being one of the better shows I've watched in a while.  I strongly recommend everyone that's ever even remotely been interested in Blade, vampires, or Sci-Fi even to check this series out, it's a buried treasure that deserves to be found.",1205971200,11,2336,4.28246013667426

I'm so sick and tired that every time I get a great series they canceled it because they get down from the stupid ratings, I don't even know how to rate them not even know how to get the emails or phone numbers either... I'm so pissed off that they canceled it, even the writers are probably pissed too, I don't know why HBO wouldn't pick it up because it is Unrated with Blood & Gore, With Never-Before-Seen Footage Mostly Nudity (Beautiful Women I mean holy s**t like Bada Bing if you like The Sopranos). I love all vampire series like ""Moonlight"",  ""Dark Shadows The Revival"" but ""Blade The Series"" was the best if ever seen I just don't know why they never get enough time to unfold.. If they wanted to cancel it they should have gotten it with a bang instead of getting a cliffhanger!!!

3284628,2,B0010TDRP0,"After a pretty successful trilogy of films starring Wesley Snipes (the first really being the beginning of the whole comic to film adaptation craze), Blade made the transition to television on Spike TV, courtesy of the films' writer David Goyer and comic scribe Geoff Johns.  The series finds Blade (now portrayed by Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones) and his partner Shen (Nelson Lee) coming to the aid of a Iraq War veteran (Jill Wagner, better known as the girl from the Mercury commercials) whose twin brother was a vampire familiar of powerful vamp Marcus Van Sciver(Neil Jackson), and was murdered because of something he knew.  All this leads to some revelations, flashbacks to Blade's past, and an inevitable showdown between Blade and Van Sciver; all of which really doesn't amount to much.  Don't get me wrong, there's a few moments of greatness to be found here, as Goyer attempts to weave a decent amount of the vampire world mythology he crafted in the very first film into the series' underbelly, but what really hurts Blade: The Series is Blade himself.  Kirk Jones looks the part, but his overacting and static dialogue delivery are more annoying than anything, and the same goes for a majority of the show's cast as well.  There's some solid amounts of nicely filmed action sequences, and hot women to boot (Wagner and the gorgeous Jessica Gower), but there just isn't enough here to make Blade: The Series worthwhile.  The series would end on a bit of a cliffhanger, as bad fan reaction and overall poor ratings would cause the show to get cancelled.  All in all, if you're a Blade fan, the series is worth a look if you missed it on TV, but otherwise, don't really bother.",1197936000,15,1684,4.766323024054983

8238490,4,B0010TDRP0,"I am hardly an unqualified fan of the Blade movie trilogy, but like the Alien Nation series, which dove head-first into the premise hinted at by its parent film -- thus staying true to its roots while establishing its own identity -- Blade: The Series was determined be its own bad self from the first frame of the pilot to the conclusion of its thirteenth and final episode.

The concept of BLADE is rooted in the myth of the vampyr or ""daywalker"" -- the vampire which can walk by daylight. In this case, Blade's mother was attacked while he was still in the womb, lending him all the strengths, but none of the weaknesses, of an ordinary vamp. Obsessed with revenging himself upon the vampire community, the half-breed Blade (Sticky Fingaz) hooks up with computer guru Shen (Nelson Lee) and a whole lot of technical wizardry and weaponry, and exterminates everything with pointy teeth that he can find. This makes him Public Enemy No. 1 to all the vampire clans in the world, who spend a lot of their time trying to find ways of bringing him down. The idea struck upon by Marcus Van Sciver (Neil Jackson) is the driving force and central mystery of the series.

So much for the concept. B:TS is the story of Krista Starr (Jill Wagner), a tough-yet-sexy Iraq veteran hellbent on discovering who murdered her troubled brother Zach. Her investigation leads to a wealthy Detroit socialite named van Sciver, who just happens to also be absolute ruler of the local vampire clan. Trying to kill Sciver, she encounters Blade. The two enter into an uneasy, peril-fraught alliance to bring down Sciver, which becomes all the more perilous when the ubervamp takes a shine to Krista and turns her. Krista struggles to adjust to life as a bloodsucker and a double agent while simultaneously fighting unwanted romantic feelings for the charming Marcus...as well as the hostility, jealousy and suspicion of Marcus' right-hand gal, the hot vamp Chase (Jessica Gower).

Like all series, BLADE alternated between the main story arc, which had Blade trying to pry open Marcus' plans and conspiracies (and Marcus trying to see them through), and stand-alone episodes. Some, like ""Headhunter"" and ""Turn of the Screw,"" were pure horror, while others (""Angels & Demons"") were more dramatic. ""Monsters,"" which features two vampires leaving a trail of havoc across the Heartland as they flee Blade, was a fine example of the flexibility of the format, being at once action, suspense and horror. It's important to emphasize that, especially for the time period in which this show debuted, it was remarkably well-crafted and professionally executed.

Full disclosure: this series was dark, brutal and relentlessly violent, not to mention explicit almost to the point of gratuitousness with both its gore and its sex, and oftimes it was difficult to find a sympathetic character anywhere. Blade, who speaks in a growl and has three facial expressions (sneer, snarl, glare), is a borderline psychopath and not always easy to root for  he doesn't just kill vampires, he kills their human servants (familiars) and often does it with great deal of sadism  in one sequence, he impales a nude blonde familiar with the remark, Be a good pet and stay, and then proceeds to cut the eye out of a second familiar, quipping, Don't worry, I only need one. The truth is that Blade is more than a bit of a bully  somewhere to the right of Wolverine and only just short of The Punisher in terms of his obsessive, pitiless fanaticism. But moral flaws aside, this show was a beautiful aesthetic experience  costume and set design, lighting, cinematography, writing, and most of the acting were all executed at the level of a mid-budget feature film. What's more, and like all good fantasy, sci-fi and horror, it builds a complex and intricate world of vampire clans, ""ash"" dealers (who sell the remains of vampires, which produces temporary bursts of vampire-like strength), and vampire history. The vampires are evil by our standards, but within their own world there are varying degrees of honor, not to mention a (completely understandable) desire to survive.  Ending with a cliffhanger of sorts after thirteen episodes, a second season was regarded as a fait accompli, but the series was unexpectedly canceled, probably due more to production costs than its rather modest ratings. Too bad. The world of Blade was rich and complex and deserved more time and more exploration.",1511827200,,4434,4.940939597315436
