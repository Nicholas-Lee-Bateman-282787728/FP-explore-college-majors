8510581,5,B0075FF5MG,"This dvd pack is in 4 parts. Bridges, Earth, Machines and Excitement. It has over 35 episodes on it. Something for everyone to watch. Not available over the counter at the shops. A great collection.",1492214400,,198,4.685714285714286
8510582,3,B0075FF5MG,"The episodes themselves are interesting to watch.  The 3 star rating of it being just okay is for two reasons.  First, the discs were labeled and packaged incorrectly.  The discs labeled for the bridge series are actually something else and vice versa and are in the wrong boxes.  Second, the theme music for the series is extremely annoying, and runs too long.  They don't even run credits during the intro so why torture us with such annoying ""music""?  I skip past it every time and get to the episode.  The annoying music also runs in a loop at the DVD main menu so you will want to quickly select your option to avoid being driven mad with the annoying, crappy music.",1482883200,,671,4.4958677685950414
