8758526,4,B01EG1PV9I,"Blood Redd is a slower approach to the werewolf storyline with decent suspense, and I prefer it this way to be honest.  It's scarier this way!  When a teenage girl named Lauren visits her grandmother, she's surprised that a super boisterous g** man opens the door instead.  Turns out this man works at the senior center down the street, and even though the grandmother thought he came over to drop off groceries and do some handywork around the house, he was actually there to beat her to death.  When Lauren arrives the man pretends to be an incredibly nice friend.  Lauren sort of suspects something is wrong because her grandmother isn't around, but Albert simply says she's taking a nap.  He even asks if she'd like to go and wake her up but Lauren declines.  Good thing Lauren, because she ain't waking up!

Albert serves Lauren wine until she gets super drunk.  He even teachers her how to properly drink wine by spinning the glass around in a circle then slowly tasting it.  How generous!  It's now nighttime.  Albert thinks it's time Lauren wakes up her grandmother.  She visits the bathroom first... and discovers her grandma in the bathtub!  Oh grandma, how did you get there?  It appears she tripped and banged her head on the shower, and for a little while the man convinces Lauren that's what happened.  When he calls for help... the phone isn't even plugged in!  Lauren doesn't seem to realize this however (even though she's looking at the floor).  It's not until Albert grabs Lauren's legs while resting on the bed that she gets suspicious.  She goes to use the bathroom and tries to crawl out the window.

Albert gets the surprise of his life.  Lauren turns into a werewolf and attacks him!  The next day Lauren sees Albert lying on the couch with a big hole in his head.  Lauren has blood all over her body.  Unfortunately for Lauren she can't remember what happened the night before.  She has no recollection of how her grandmother died.  Oh well that sucks!  Albert takes advantage of this.  He doesn't reveal he actually beat the woman to death.  Instead Albert says Lauren turned into a werewolf, and now he's a werewolf since she bit him!

Lauren calls her mother and she says she'll be over in 20 minutes. Albert comes up with this idea that Lauren will bring the outside dog in through the bathroom window, and they'll tell the police it was a dog attack that took out the grandmother and attacked both Albert and Lauren.  He wants Lauren to hurry before her mom arrives but she doesn't do it.  It's funny how the guy had a super excited voice when having a conversation with Lauren over wine, and when it's discovered he killed Lauren's grandmother his voice turns much deeper and normal.  What a fake!

Lauren tells her mom exactly what happens, so when the dad arrives he beats Albert to death, carries his body to a shed in the middle of nowhere and Lauren's mom explains that she's part of a family bloodline.  Many of the females in the family have this werewolf changing ability.  I'm not someone who can normally predict storylines, but I think I saw this one coming.  I didn't read the description for this movie before watching it either.  Early on during the conversation with Albert Lauren says her family despises meat and forbids Lauren to eat it.  I suspected there has to be a good reason for this!  Sure enough, the consumption of meat would make Lauren's werewolf transformation likelier to happen.  Albert put her grandmother's blood in the wine which triggered the same result as eating meat.

Anyway Lauren's mom comes up with the same idea.  Let the dog in through the bathroom window so it looks like a dog attacked the grandmother.  The only difference is, Albert won't be in the picture and it'll be like Lauren was never here.  Afterwards we see conversations between the a forensic pathologist and a cop in the autopsy room figuring out what's causing people around town to have their bodies half eaten.  The pathologist is more persistent than ever.  He knows something is wrong with Lauren and her mom's story.  He questions why Lauren covered her ears when he rang the doorbell for one thing.  To be fair a broken doorbell that rings nonstop until someone walks outside to fix it *is* pretty freakin' annoying.

The pathologist also analyzes the crime scene.  He wonders why Lauren used a silver cross hanging on the wall (the cross she used to stab Albert with, assuming he was a vampire) when there's so many other sharp objects lying around.  He examines the grandmother's DNA to look for similarities.  He even visits Lauren at school, and when he shakes Lauren's hand he notices the dog bite mark on her arm is gone.  Being a werewolf makes cuts and bruises heal much faster.  Considering the story here is about werewolves, it's almost *too* bizarre that the pathologist is able to put the clues together with ease and determine Lauren's a werewolf.  It's not like he's a werewolf himself or anything.  SPOILERS!  The story ends with Lauren turning into a werewolf and munching on Albert who's chained to a chair.  It's feeding time!  Poor Albert thought he'd also turn into a werewolf and be able to one day kill Lauren.  Nope!  He's not a relative of Lauren's.  That's how the werewolf transformation works!

Blood Redd definitely isn't a highly produced movie by any means. It's not really low budget either.  It's somewhere in between.  The acting is pretty stellar.  Lauren's protective mother is an underrated character.  Lauren's kinda quiet but decent, and Albert's great.  A slower approach to a werewolf story is much appreciated and makes the story easier to follow.  Recommended.",1500508800,,5652,4.720286885245901
8758527,2,B01EG1PV9I,"The English title for this film is ""Blood Redd"" which doesn't let you know it is a werewolf film, but written by punsters who were as talented as the ""Joan of Arcadia"" crowd. My apologies to the individual who watched the TV series.

The film opens with a werewolf scene and we discover that young girls are being found with their crotch chewed out. The police investigator (Michael Teh) believes the girls are being raped and large dogs are being used to hide the evidence while the pathologist (Christopher Frainza) believes the community may be annoyed by a werewolf issue.

The film really centers on Lauren Redd (Stephanie Hullar) hence the oh-so-clever English title. She visits her grandmother (Peggy Ivene) and in one scene is wearing what looks like a red cloak. Albert (Torey Widener) is grandmother's care taker who is clearly not what he seems.

I really did like the plot idea, including the way they handled the twist (sorry I mentioned it.) However, the low budget aspect killed the film. The sound wasn't good. The special effects, which we see at the end, were abysmally bad. The sound track which started out fine during the opening credits feel into a tired piano. The acting was below ""B"" film standard with the dialogue not helping.

Guide: The film was made in English. I caught 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Stephanie Hullar gives us a little tease.",1465689600,2,1370,4.743697478991597
