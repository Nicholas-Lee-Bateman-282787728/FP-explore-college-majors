8226649,2,B000X1Z0FG,"This is a fantasy movie about a Hollywood moviemaker who falls in love with a woman from a TV Soap who magically appears from his TV.
The move starts very slowly and confusing. The beginning and the ending were annoying.
The most pleasant thing about the movie was the performance from the actress Kimberly Oja.",1334966400,,311,4.672727272727273
8226650,4,B000X1Z0FG,"When I think of an independent movie, the operative word for me is ""independent.""

The movie, CHANNELS, is just that.  And it is imaginatively very good.  Watching a movie with an original voice, while observing some very fine actors such as our leads, Nat Christian and Kim Oja, along with Ed Asner, Taylor Negron, John Kassir and Joan Van Ark, is truly a joy.

Christian and Oja are a great pair.  He is so compellingly real and natural, that you think the camera just peeked in on him.  She is engaging as well with a delightfully reserved charm.

Christian is also the writer and director of CHANNELS.  He brews poignant thoughts and some laughs, beautifully and skillfully wrapped to open for an enjoyable watch.

The romantic look of the movie is helped by cinematography (Michael Hardwick). production design (Dolores Piazza) and visual effects (Duane Condor).

There are several very funny scenes in the movie.
I hope to see more from Christian.",1236470400,3,953,4.863354037267081
8226651,5,B000X1Z0FG,"Romantic comedies is a genre which I usually don't go out of my way to see.  I like them really funny or really romantic.  But generally, this genre is usually too light for me.  A friend of mine saw this at a film festival and recommended it.

Well, ""Channels"" is a romantic comedy, but it is more, or it has a fuller plate.  I really enjoyed the romance and the comedic aspects, but I was also very moved.  It takes our lead characters to a crossroads where they must decide, logically or instinctually, on what to do.

The writer and director, Nat Christian, wonderfully delivers his vision about a man, who is about to move up in his career, yet is very bored about everything in his life.  He does feel alive whenever he watches a character on a TV series.  Through a strange event, she meets up wt him at his place.  They try to figure it all out and, in the process, fall in love with each other.  Then she decides that if she believes deeply enough in their situation, it is indeed ""reality.""  His logic gets in his way.  And this is where he approaches another crossroad.

The film stars Kim Oja as ""Katherine.""  Oja, a gifted actress, wonderfully executes the task of playing dual characters.  I wish we could see more of her on the big screen.  Nat Christian also plays the lead character of ""Black.""  He is a compelling, ""organic"" actor delivering a highly crafted nuanced performance.  I felt like I was watching a regular guy from the street... an ""every man.""  Together, Christian and Oja work very well on the screen.

A funny showbiz agent is wonderfully played by the talented, John Kassir (famous for his ""voices"").  Also excellent is Taylor Negron.  Joan Van Ark brings much sympathy to her character as a TV executive who must stand tough.  And Ed Asner is both strong and hilarious as another studio type executive. He is a national treasure.

The look is romantic.  The production design by Dolores Piazza contributes to that.  Beautiful images were captured by cinematographer Michael Hardwick and was helped along by Visual Effects artist, Duane Condor.  A song written by Daryl Orenge (with lyrics by Christian) is very catchy.  And the score by Rossano Galante is brilliant.

I found the DVD copy to be a little on the dark side, but I was told that the screening at the festival was not.  Hopefully that will be fixed on the next printing.

I loved ""Channels.""  It gave me a wonderful experience.",1231286400,,2424,4.588785046728972
8226652,5,B000X1Z0FG,"Loved the feel of this movie.  Romantic, yet very thoughtful.  I thought about it a lot after seeing it.

All of the actors did a very fine job.  This is an intelligent movie.  Not your typical genre type.  I kind of wished the ending would be different, but I respect the writer/director's vision.

Actors, Nat Christian, Kim Oja, Ed Asner, John Kassir, Taylor Negron, Joan Van Ark give it their all.  They are real and truthful in a comedy, which is what makes the comedy work.

The direction is superb, slowly involving us in a man's state of being, then having us get caught up in the romance, and then his decision on what to do next.  The music, look and FX  were great too.

If you're looking for something unique, then this may be for you.

I hope that, in today's climate, more films like this are made.",1230940800,2,812,4.369127516778524
8226653,4,B000X1Z0FG,"Channels is not your ordinary romantic comedy.  It is sweet, funny and sad.  And I felt for the characters a lot.

The excellent cast includes Nat Christian, Kim Oja, Ed Asner, Taylor Negron, Johnn Kassir and Joan Van Ark.  All of the minor characters are played by talented actors.

Talented Kim Oja brings a Carol Lombardish quality to the screen.

Nat Christian instills his character with an arc that ranges from cynical to madly in love expressive, to deep  sadness.

The chemistry between Oja and Christian is like some of the great old time movie star couples during the screwball era.

One of my favorite lines is when Christian's character tells her (he delivers it like a compliment) that, one day, she will make some very lucky man very unhappy.

John Kassir, always a good actor, brings a cynical agent to life in this movie.

Joan Van Ark is beautiful and quite believable as a tough but courteous producer.

Taylor Negron skillfully plays an idealistic, but very politic person.  Ed Asner has a great monologue which he delivers beautifully.

The story telling is first class and doesn't rely on shock elements.  The direction keeps it moving and seems to give all of the actors a lot of freedom.

The music by Rossano Galante could have well been made for a mega dollar studio film.  Notably, there is a song written by Daryl Orenge and Nat Christian, that is quite catchy.

The DP's ""look"", the Production Design and VFX are all excellent.

Channels is one of those finds, which takes you by surprise and a subtle journey.",1230854400,,1538,4.714285714285714
8226654,5,B000X1Z0FG,"I saw this at a friend's house and really liked it.  I bought it, because I thought there may be some more subtle references that I didn't catch the first time.

CHANNELS, written and directed by Nat Christian, who also plays the lead character of ""Black'"" is a unique film that presents us with a situation that many of us can relate to.  Do we take action now or hesitate?

Christian masterfully crafts a story about a movie producer who is about to step up in his career, goes home at nights completely bored.  He is lifeless.  He then basically channel surfs.  He comes to life when a certain character, ""Katherine,"" enters a scene in a night time soap opera.

Through a strange circumstance, Katherine enters Black's world and the two of them fall in love with each other.  At a certain point, Katherine doesn't care about making ""sense"" of it all and wants to give it her all.  It seems like Black might feel the same way.  I won't say what happens from this point on, because this is where the third act, so to speak, starts to kick in.

Oja, an adorable actress, skillfully brings humor as well as drama in her task of playing dual roles.  You like watching this very talented actress.  And apparently Christian knew that by giving her character many closeups.

Christian delivers a powerful nuanced performance.  A truthful actor. Such performances are seen in some very good recent movies, such at the one given by the lead actor, who plays the professor, in ""The Visitor.""  Christian is always honest and we faithfully follow his character throughout.

Christian and Oja have a great chemistry on the screen.

Taylor Negron, best known for more comedic roles, delivers a warm and touching performance as a director.

John Kassir is funny and sharp as a movie industry agent.

Ed Asner delivers some very punchy lines as well.  He is also wonderfully tough as a studio boss.

Joan Van Ark is getting more attractive as the years go on, and is sharp and very sympathetic as a TV Producer.

The look is romantic thanks to the skillful photography by Michael Hardwick and the set design by Dolores Piazza.

A powerful score by Rossano Galante carries a wallop.

The visual effects (and co-editing) by Duane Condor is quite effective.

For me, the story works as a romantic comedy and a bittersweet love story.  But also profoundly as a philosophical thought.

I'm noticing more movies starting to come out that are more poetic and philosophical in content.  I hope the trend continues.

CHANNELS sneaks up on you with quite a punch.",1230508800,,2539,4.6893424036281175
8226655,5,B000X1Z0FG,"I love triple threat movies.  Meaning written, directed by and acted in movies.  I do because I can see witness an artist's voice.  That is why I prefer to watch independent films.  I can at least hear a voice.  A ""voice"" is what I am looking for in a painting, a song or a movie, even if I'm not crazy about the subject matter.

CHANNELS feels like the best of the old-fashioned films. Which means, when made today it is wonderfully crafted and sophisticated.  A passionate, charming, witty, romantic story about a love transcending space and time.

In the imaginatively written screenplay by writer/director Nat Christian, the lead character, ""Black"", also played by Christian, is a busy producer on the rise.  But he really doesn't have a spark in hi life.  He meets ""Katherine"", played by the beautiful Kim Oja, and together their chemistry keeps you glued to the screen.

Christian, with great skill, gives the character of Black charm and cynicism, and is deliciously romantic when he meets Oja.  He is fun and tragic at the same time.  You immediately connect with his character.

Oja also displays great skill in playing comedy, coupled with moving scenes of reflective sadness.  The two of them captivate the screen.

The whole cast plays every role with precision.

Ed Asner is always wonderful. And here is tough as well as funny.  He also has one wonderful monologue.

Joan Van Ark is looking better as she ages.  Beautiful and smart.  She comes of sympathetic as a smart but vulnerable TV executive.

Taylor Negron is refreshingly sincere.

John Kassir delivers a memorable performance as a cocky (and funny) talent agent.

The beautiful photography by Michael Hardwick never gets in the way of the characters.

Rossanno Galante's score is sweeping.

This movie's budget is listed as being at around 200 thousand dollars.  Christian and the crew got a big bang for their money

Lots to think about in this unusual love story.  Maybe even a little bit of quantum physics!",1230163200,,1983,4.8532934131736525
8226656,1,B000X1Z0FG,"I watched this mess last night, and I was extremely disappointed. This absolutely has to be the worse movie that I have watched in years. My only joy in this is that I only wasted $4 on it instead of $30.

The HD picture only enabled me to see how lame the special effects were, granted this was an indie film, but I've seen better done with less. One particular sequence that stands out is a dream of someone riding a train, and it absolutely had to be the worst CGI that I have ever seen on a pressed disk. Not only was this scene awful, they kept showing it over and over and over again, like they didn't see how bad it was.

The plot of the film is just as lame as the special effects. Black is a depressed producer has lightening strike his TV, and the female character that he admires from a crappy syndicated soap opera comes to life in his livingroom. When her show comes on, she disappears, and then returns. black then lets his life spiral down the tubes as he tries to hold on to this woman, which ultimately, he can not do. resulting in him ending up more depressed than he was at the beginning of the film.",1229040000,,1119,4.175925925925926
8226657,2,B000X1Z0FG,"... and that's Nat Christian, who did the triple job of writing, directing, and acting.  Apparently this stretched him too thin, because Channels suffers from a weak script and a lackluster performance by him as the male lead.  In contrast, Kim Oja, the female lead, is a breath of fresh air.

The story of ""Channels"" is a pretty straightforward fantasy.  A Hollywood producer with professional success but a humdrum personal life falls in love with a TV character.  Something inexplicable happens, and she suddenly pops into his life -- and the next day pops out again.  When he tracks down the actress who plays the role, he discovers that she's not the same sweet woman he met; instead she's a foul-mouthed shrew.  Somehow the TV character has acquired a life in the real world -- except for the time when her show is airing.

The two hit it off, with his work and her show forcing brief separations.  But then the character is killed off her show, and he goes to great lengths to try to bring her back from TV limbo.  I won't give away the ending, but that's probably the weakest part of Christian's script for this movie.

In her dual roles as TV character and the greatly different actress, Kim Oja brings much-needed spirit to ""Channels"".  Taylor Negron, Ed Asner, Joan Van Ark, and John Kassir are quite good in supporting parts.  The production values are good, considering this is clearly a low-budget picture.  But overall I have to rate ""Channels"" a flop, because Nat Christian's reach exceeded his grasp.",1219363200,,1517,4.718631178707224
8226658,1,B000X1Z0FG,"I don't write many reviews here, but this film had none and I just watched it and wanted to help others avoid wasting their time and money.

I watched two independent films in one weekend, Rain in the Mountains and Channels.  The former suffered from bad acting and unskilled post-production, but had a charming story and acceptable writing.  Channels was the exact opposite, with good acting/production but horrible writing.  I found the former to be much more forgivable.

The film is a mess.  It is about a man who finally finds happiness with a fictional woman from a soap opera who is magically brought into his living room every so often due to a lightning strike.  Unfortunately, we are given no reason to care about the man or the woman.  We have little explanation as to why they are so unhappy at first, and no real feeling that fate was justified in putting them together.  They share a couple of tame dates with each other and fall in love, but the middle of the story drags as all the writers could think of was to have them talk and talk about how great those dates were and how much in love they are.

The beginning is bearable, the middle is long and torturous, and the end is once again bearable as he tries and save her from being written out of the soap so she can come back one last time forever.  Overall, though, the sloppy writing, slow pacing, and bland editing make this a clunker to avoid at all costs.  If you still want to see this movie, don't buy it, I'll give you my copy.",1204934400,8,1503,4.386281588447654
