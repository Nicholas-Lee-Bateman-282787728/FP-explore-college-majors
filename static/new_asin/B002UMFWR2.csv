VERY, VERY POOR QUALITY SOUND.The Announcers were terribly insulting to the crowd and I'm not new to rodeo, but there is no need to insult the crowd when the cowboys perform badly. They also put microphones down at the chutes, which was a mistake. My kids could hear all of the four letter words the cowboys used while getting ready to perform. In ALL of my other NFR DVDs we also hear some background music during the saddle bronc & bull riding --- but not in this one. It was probably there, but it didn't make it to the DVD microphones!

Plus, at the very beginning of each daily list, they ask you if you want to go down and select an event to watch, or , do you want to ""Play All"". I have three of the seven events that I want to watch so I NEVER hit ""Play All"".

In most of the previous versions / previous years, I can go down and select Saddle Bronc Riding, and after that section has played, it takes me back to the main menu so I can select the next event that I want to watch. Not here --- after your selected event has played, this DVD automatically starts playing all of the other events in order, you no longer have a choice unless you eject the DVD and start it over again.",1344988800,,1233,4.1120331950207465

8469191,5,B002UMFWR2,THis is the first time I have made a purchase of the NFR Video from Amazon.com.  IN the past I have purchased the video while in Las Vegas at the NFR or directly on line from Rodoe Video.  This was an easier way to make my purchase along with other items.,1269129600,,255,3.980392156862745
