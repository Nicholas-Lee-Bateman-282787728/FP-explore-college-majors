8201754,4,B000RO9PXM,"Don't be put off by the bland DVD cover (the Australian one has a different but equally uninspiring one), The Alice is actually quite a good movie.  It is low budget but is quite a good character driven story.  It's best to know as little as possible about this one before viewing basically we follow a number of different characters and their journey towards Alice Springs where they hope to view a once in a lifetime solar eclipse. I wondered if much would happen in this but we begin with a guy being confronted by bikers, one of which wants to know why he is sleeping with his wife.  A disgruntled pokies play throws a machine through a window in a pub then comes back in a semi trailer and drives it through the wall.  A doctor boards a train to Darwin and overhears his relatives discussing the he is definitely gay (he's not).

The characters are from all walks of life, and include a washed up rock star, a depressed woman in an abusive relationship whose husband wants to run up Ayers Rock during the eclipse and is training by running there with her and a friend in the support vehicle.  A trio of teen/early twenties friends who had convinced some German eclipse enthusiasts to let them give them the experience who had booked them into that pub and have to ad lib so as to keep the money with the white guy pretending he is a Steve Irwin type character and the aboriginal guy and girl pretending they know how to live of the land when they clearly haven't ever been taught any ancient ways.

The movie is fairly predictable in parts, you know for example the old lady on the train twist long before that is revealed, as well as the situation with the motorhome wife, but still it's a pretty worthwhile movie to watch.  If you're not familiar with the Australian Outback this also will show you it as the scenery is sort of an additional character in this one.",1421193600,,1871,4.4186046511627906
8201755,5,B000RO9PXM,"This delightful movie sparked a series that was just as interesting and light hearted.  Not blood thirsty, not too much overt sex, not even violent particularly.  The story line continued about the relationships of a variety of people living and working in Alice Springs.  Can't get any further OutBack than that.  Mellow viewing for young and old, wish they had carried it on further.",1341705600,3,385,4.96875
8201756,5,B000RO9PXM,"""The Alice"" is a charming movie with a lot of heart and emotion. An eclipse serves to bring seeming strangers together and then reveals how intertwined their lives are. Think of ""Crash"" without the racism and depressing story.  All this is presented in an excellent subtle style. If you need a movie's plot to be explained to you or shoved in your face, this movie may not be for you. If you enjoy losing yourself in a movie and letting the story tell itself, you will enjoy ""The Alice"".",1239321600,4,487,4.47191011235955
8201757,2,B000RO9PXM,I think my mind must have been going through an eclipse when I purchased this movie.  There is hardly any substance to the story.  The eclipse phenomenon isn't very realistic either.,1211846400,,182,4.838709677419355
