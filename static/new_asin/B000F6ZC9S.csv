WILD BILL HICKOK: The Gentleman of the West.

James Butler Hickok is presented as a larger-than-life legend. Called one of the greatest shootists ever, it's said he could split a bullet on a dime, remove a cork by bullet without breaking the bottle, or shoot an airborne piece of paper six times before it touched ground.

Kindly in demeanor, tall and handsome, with flowing long hair that once dared Plains Indians to try and capture it, Bill's mild manner was a veneer for a quick-tempered man with no compunction about pulling the trigger. Hickok claimed to have killed 100 men, always in self-defense.

Raised an Abolitionist, by age 18 Hickok was involved in the 1856 anti-slavery struggles of Bleeding Kansas. In those early days he became friends with Bill Cody. During Union Army scout service, Hickok was given the sobriquet of ""Wild Bill."" In the post-war era he scouted for George Custer's 7th Cavalry.

As Abilene marshal in 1871, Hickok accidentally shot and killed his own deputy during a saloon fracas. This incident haunted him forever.

Between brief acting stints, including an 1873 engagement with old friend Bill Cody, Hickok continued working as a lawman.

A number of late-19th Century dime novels created the Hickok legend that persists to this day. It's doubtful his one fatal vice, that of almost obsessive card gambling, was part of these laudatory tales.

By 1876 when he was 39, Hickok was in failing health, especially his eyesight, from glaucoma and opthalmia. Wiling away his time in a Dakota Territory saloon by playing cards, Bill usually sat with his back to a wall for protection, but on 8/2/76 the only seat available at the poker table placed his back opposite a door. ""Crooked Nose"" Jack McCall entered, stealthily approached Hickok from behind and fired a bullet in the back of his head after shouting ""Damn you! Take that!"" Thus the final Hickok legend, that of ""Aces and Eights,"" the dead man's hand.

This documentary would be good for a young student unfamiliar with the Old West's celebrities.
It offers however little new information to aficionados of that colorful era.",1447372800,2,2186,4.937329700272479
