1084993,5,6305861714,"This video features the episodes that are currently being aired on Cartoon Network. I am a die-hard Sailor Moon fan, but I need something different and now I've got a little bit of both:) This show is really good if you  like Star Wars type shows, and even if you don't like Star Wars you will  defenitly like this video!  Gundam Wing had 49 episodes and a 3 part movie  known as 'Endless Waltz'. This story not only focuses on the Gundams, but  each character has their own story going on too. Heero (the pilot of Wing  Gundam,Epyon,and Zero) seems to be the most grim and cold of the pilots.  Relena ends up softening Heero up a little. Duo (GUndam Deathschyte's  pilot)is the funniest,Quatre (Gundam Sandrock's pilot)is the nicest,Wufei  (Shenlong's pilot)is the least emotional,and Trowa (Heavyarm's pilot)is a  mystery. Oh well....what I mean is that you MUST get this video and start  watching Gundam Wing!",962323200,4,912,4.819354838709677
1084994,5,6305861714,"I think that Gundam Wing has to be one of the greatest Sci-Fi anime's in america so far.  What got me hooked on this fascinating Anime is the fact that it is realistic.  It gives you an idea about what war can be like.  You sometimes do not know who your enemies are from the start and even  after you think you know who they are you can be wrong.  It also seems to  be realistic in the fact that people do die in it, just like in war it  shows that loved ones can die in war and that tragedy isn't always death.  For example Heero Yuy is the pilot of the Wing/Wing Zero, his father was an  assasin who dumped him off on a colony calling him worthless.  Heero later  trained to work for Operation Meteor, who made him a ruthless emotionless  killing machine.  The aspects of reality mixed with amazing mechanical  designs, well developed characters, great music, and a nice story line make  this anime a 2 thumbs up winner.  To find out more about his anime visist  anipike.com and look under anime and manga series e-g and scroll down till  ya find gundam.  Warning- the plot can get kind of confusing so my advice  is to not skip episodes you could miss half the story.",962323200,3,1171,4.260273972602739
1084995,5,6305861714,"Gundam Wing is the bomb!  This is deffinatly the greatest of ALL the Gundam Series.  From the revealing of Relena's true identity, to the awesome battles, you will meet characters and ponder the ideas and dialog  put forth.

1084998,5,6305861714,"Here it is, the second volume of the hit TV series on Cartoon Network. All I can say is: if you're not already hooked on Gundam Wing then you need to open your eyes. What we have here is one cool story. Terrorists, gigantic  mobile suits, mad scientists, a military conspiracy... If it doesn't  entrance you just WATCHING Oz's political and military maneuvers than  either you have no appreciation, or I'm reading way more into it than there  actually is. I'd have to say Gundam Wing has a very serious storyline, so  if you are tired of cute shows like poke'mon and Sailor Moon (I'll admit  Sailor Moon is a good series. No offense, Moonies) then Gundam Wing is  perfect. I mean, its about a war, and it comes right out and says so! If  you can't take the dark atmosphere and diligent seriousness of the  characters, then go watch something else. The main characters are  COMPLETELY dedicated to completing their mission, and are prepared to take  their own lives rather than be captured. It's not all fighting and backroom  politicing, however. This show also features 5 15-year old guys that can  EASILY be classified as Bishonen. They may seem a little emotionless at  first (except Duo and Quatre and especially Trowa) but they are fighting in  a war staged by adults, and like all of us, they're trying to find the  purpose in their lives, be it saving their colonies or destroying as many  Leos and Tauros's as they can. Gundam Wing doesn't seem to rate high in  terms of symbolism, but there is some in there. The Alliance and OZ  uniforms refer back to different historical eras and tell a lot about the  motivations of each. There's even hidden meaning to the characters names!  All the main characters are named after numbers (hmmm, I don't think Relena  is a number...) in different languages. It's bizarre, but in a good way.  Another thing that's a bit strange is the voice acting. Except for Wufei,  they didn't even try to find similar voice actors to the originals. Heero  and Trowa aren't as cold, Treize and Zechs aren't as aristocratic. It's not  all bad though. Quatre doesn't sound like a wuss any more and Relena  doesn't sound QUITE so much like a psychopath. I suppose Duo's voice may  seem a bit strange, but it'll grow on you, believe me. All in all, Gundam  Wing is a series that will either leave you speachless with it's amazing  action, or drop your jaw with it's beautiful animation. It's that good.  Watch and get hooked: THE G-BOYS HAVE COME TO THE STATES!",960595200,12,2490,4.616438356164384

7896872,5,6305861714,"As Relena and her father take off to visit the colony, Lady Une follows. When Relena's father starts the meeting with colony, Relena goes out to look around only to find that Lady Une set up a trap and ends up killing Relena's father. Une covers up the situation pretty cleverly while Relena talks with Heero's instructor, Doctor J. Meanwhile back on earth, Duo and Heero take out an OZ base. The next episodes is basically based on the relationship between Heero and Relena and a small, yer very exciting battle ensues. The final episode is by far the best. Heero, Duo, Trowa and Quatre head towards a meeting where the Earth's Sphere will meet. However, Trieze Kushrenada tricks the Gundam pilots into believing that this is where the OZ representitives are meeting. Foolishly, Heero is the one who ends up killing all the Earth Sphere leaders. Afterwards, OZ wipes out the Earth's Sphere forces around the world and the new revolution begins. The battle were just as great as the last one with some impressive camera work. The dub proofs to be worthy of Gundam Wing, though I wish Bandai hired more voice actors instead of improvising. Overall, I'd say a pretty exciting tape and not one to miss.",982972800,,1199,4.714285714285714
7896873,5,6305861714,"This video contains the next three episodes in the GW series.  It starts  off with Vice Foreign-Minister Darlian getting knocked-off by Oz.  From  there we learn more about Relena's past.  Heero shows that he does have a  heart by saving Relena's life.  And finaly, Treize Khushrenada sets up a  nice little trap for the Gundams.  If you haven't seen the first four  episodes, you might get a little confused by the plot.  This video is  edited.  The violence is mainly Mobile Suits being destroyed.  All in all  this video is suitable for children 7 years and up because of its depiction  of war and how heartless it is.",965865600,2,621,4.611111111111111

7896875,5,6305861714,I am a devoted fan of the Gundams. And contary to what people think they ARE NOT CARTOONS. They are anamated that's true but they are very intense and not for younger vewers. I watch it every weeknight at midnight on  cartoon network just to see the uncut verson. If you like DBZ then you  should love this! The envolvment is intense. In other words... WATCH  THIS!,964310400,,365,4.417910447761194
