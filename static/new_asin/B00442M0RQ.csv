8508747,3,B00442M0RQ,"This documentary is a follow-up to the film ""Russia's Wonder Children"" that examines the lives of four piano prodigies ten years later.  There are excerpts of these young men and women as children playing the piano that are simultaneously uplifting and frightening - as seeing mere children playing some astonishingly difficult music can be a bit off-putting.  The film shows them both at their studies and behind-the-scenes preparing for or giving concerts around the world.  The real power of the film is in the daily struggles of which many are unaware...trying to find a manager, and competing with all of the other gifted pianists that are trying to make a living in this profession.  As Elena Kolesnichenko says, ""It's like standing in your own shadow.  Everyone's thinking, `there's that girl who used to...'"".

It is very evident in the film that each of these young people is under tremendous pressure to succeed.  We see Elena talk about playing at the Beethoven Competition (and shame on them for not allowing her performance to be filmed), and her reaction back at home with her husband after not winning the competition.  The level of emotional involvement that these artists put into their work is not unexpected, but it is particularly touching when witnessed in this way.

As for the film itself, it lacks the polish of other documentaries, the camera lingering in places that lead to a feeling of the film dragging as many independent films do.  But if you are captivated by music and want to learn more about what it takes to get to the concert hall stage, then this film provides a valuable look behind the performance curtain.",1310860800,3,1646,4.888489208633094
