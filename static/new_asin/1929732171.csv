7801388,1,1929732171,"This item never came.  I waited for over a month and finally got notification that the seller couldn't locate it anywhere.  Asked if I wanted to wait a whwile longer.  I said ok, but then it till didn't come.  Finally, I just gave up.",1269216000,,234,4.25
7801389,5,1929732171,"I have been looking for ""The Cake"" episode of this series for years! I was over the moon when I found it here on [...]. I've told friends about this episode throughout the years, sometimes people ask me if I wrote it because I describe it in such detail. I just respond with, ""No, I just love the episode.""

Love is an understatement. I was so inspired by ""The Cake"" that I became a cake decorator of unusual and creative cakes. This episode is so much fun and has a great twist ending that makes me hope that one day I'll be surprised like this for my birthday. (Note: Jan. 1st if anyone wants to know!)

This beautiful woman, this wife, is so worried that her husband will get the seven year itch that she decides that buying him a sweater for his birthday is NOT an option. She stumbles upon a bakery and is moved to do something bold. Instead of buying a cake with card and present she becomes the cake AND present. The pastry chef and his assistant are adorable and lusty as every cake/pastry should be, is my opinion. This episode encourages the main recipe for all sensual relationships--fun!

Maybe if I wish hard enough I'll get my birthday ""Cake"" wish too!",1198368000,6,1166,4.388888888888889
7801390,5,1929732171,"Okay, I'm going to be a little bias on critiquing this DVD.  This is because I am the writer of the story of one of the three episodes on this DVD.
This DVD consists of the Red Shoe Diaries episodes: The Game, The  Cake, and Like Father Like Son.
'The Game' is about a woman who broke  herself free of a relationship that was based on a sexual 'truth or dare'  style game.  This episode is for the ""no holds barred"" type of  lovers out there.
'The Cake' is the episode I wrote the story for.  It's  about a woman who can't decide on a birthday cake at a bakery for her  husband.  The baker gets an idea to decorate her as the birthday cake.  The  results?  You'll have to see for yourself.  :)  This episode is for anyone  curious to try new things.
'Like Father Like Son' is about a man  infatuated with his father's lover.  She, at first, thinks of him as just a  boy but thinks otherwise later and has to decide between the two.
The DVD  has some excellent additions to it:
Photo galleries from all 3 episodes
An option to hear commentary from producer/director Zalman King during  the episodes
A Red Shoe Diaries trivia game
Behind the scenes footage  (mostly in 'The Cake') that you can view at the appropriate moments of the  episode
English and Spanish Translations
For the Red Shoe Diaries fans,  this is a must have DVD.  I hope you like it (especially my episode).
Oh,  I do have a 1 1/2 second cameo on 'The Cake'.  If you use the 'commentary'  option, Zalman will point me out to you.  :)
Enjoy!",964137600,54,1507,4.2821428571428575
