8257430,1,B00153LC58,"First, my credentials are that I am a second degree black belt & self defense expert with many years of Kyusho/Dim Mak experience.
I teach only self defense techniques that really work.

I spent about $267 on this whole DVD series, but thank God I was able to get my money back!
Every single thing about this series is even worse than substandard.
I kid you not, there was even an attack demonstrated with a soup ladle!!!
The techniques & the instruction were terrible.
Even some of the Kyusho point locations were incorrect.

For those interested in qualty DVD instruction, I strongly suggest the DVDs by Evan Pantazi &/or Scott Rogers.
Dragon Society International also offers good instruction, but the DVDs are expensive & the video quality is not so great.
I had no intension of being mean spirited with this review.
I am just trying to save someone some money & disappointment.
I hope this advice has helped.
