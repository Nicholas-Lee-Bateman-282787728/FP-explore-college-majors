277097,5,6300246787,"My grandma taped this for me on VHS (some of you are asking what that is) in probably 1992 or 1993, and I watched it until it wore out. I actually had a dress up chest in which I kept a sombrero and feather boa so I could march around and sing all the songs while the movie was playing. Watching it as an adult, it's hard not to sing along and dance it out. But seeing it in HD and seeing the costumes in detail makes the movie fantastic in a new way, and now that I have it online I can't wait to share it with my children as well.",1509235200,2,532,3.7589285714285716

277105,5,6300246787,"One of my all-time favorites, and I watched it again last night -- but this time with my 9 year old granddaughter.  What an absolute delight it was to watch her experience it for the first time!  She loved it every bit as much as I do, and can't wait to watch it again.  The entire cast is magnificent and Barbra Streisand shines like the glittering star is and will always be; the costumes are gorgeous; the singing and dancing is fantastic; and the story is just a ton of fun.  Love everything about this movie.",1501632000,,513,4.3125
277106,4,6300246787,"Lively, funny, a Streisand classic",1500595200,,34,6.0
277107,2,6300246787,"There's nothing right with this film, and the critics were on the button. The show is actually about a middle aged woman who has lost her husband and most of her money - so she NEEDS to get married. She has spent most of her life making other people happy, and now she finds herself the only one without the financial security of a partner. Streisand is so stunning in the film, and so young, that the story goes right out the window. There's no way that this gorgeous creature would EVER be alone! So the film loses the most important quality of the piece - you are never touched by her plight, and never worried either. She's supposed to have been gone for nearly fifteen years, which in the film would have made her around eight when she was married! Everything about it is a mess. It's too big, the supporting cast are dreadful, and it's too 60's. If you've ever seen the show on the stage, you'll get why it's all wrong right away. If you haven't, you might enjoy it. But there's a reason it was a massive financial failure. And here it is. If you can, get to see Bette Midler on Broadway in the role. That's how the film should have been, but wasn't.",1498694400,,1156,4.28310502283105

277158,5,6300246787,"Growing up with the Spanish knock-off version (""Hola, Dolly!""), it was refreshing to see this classic of the Vietnam era in glorious English. Babs kills. I mean, many people were upset that Carol Channing was robbed for the big-screen part, and that the film deservedly bombed. I personally believe that a little-known Broadway star would have guaranteed success for this film rather than future EGOT queen Streisand. I read recently that Babs has a shopping mall in the basement of her Malibu home. I'm not sure what that has to do with this film, but it's an awesome fact. I am not afraid to admit that I love Barbra Streisand. She's kind of like Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond in that any LP collection ever built has at least one of their albums, you can find those albums at every thrift store in America, and secretly, EVERYONE LOVES THEM. Admit it, you know at least one Barbra Streisand, Neil, and Barry song by heart. You be singing ""Mandy"" in the car by yourself and crying, and ""Kentucky Woman"" gets you up and dancing whenever it comes on. Suffice to say, watch Hello, Dolly! and you won't regret it. Now go put on your Sunday clothes before the parade passes by! (Those are songs from the musical, folks. Check the track listing).",1471392000,4,1243,4.6289592760181

277192,5,6300246787,"Watching Barabara Streisand is pure delight. Those who are not Streisand fans, nor musical theater fans, might find it all a bit silly. And some parts are. But for those of us who love Babs and muscial theater, you can't go wrong with Hello, Dolly! Engaging theme. Great musical numbers choreographed by Michael Kidd. A cameo appearance by Louis Armstrong. And more! I have seen this movie many, many times, and I suspect I will watch it several more times before I die. It makes me laugh. It makes me cry. No, I'm not crazy in love with every scene. But the stand out scenes/numbers are so enthralling (primarily the ones with Streisand), it's easy to sit through those that are less so. 5 Stars for Ms. Streisand!",1466035200,,715,4.59375

277371,3,6300246787,"I am not a huge fan of musicals so a musical has to be really good for me to appreciate it. This one is OK but nothing real special IMO. It has a couple of good numbers in it (Hello Dolly is pretty darn good and will probably have you singing along). Most of the rest of the numbers are OK, but nothing real memorable.

It is filmed well, and the costumes are also done well, and there is some nice dancing here and there.

But overall, it was just an average movie to me. I enjoyed it or I would not have finished watching it, but it just did not appeal to me as much as it might to someone who is a big fan of Streisand or of musicals.

It did not seem to me that there was all that much of a story. That might be why I did not get into it. Just singing, and dancing, and costumes.",1425254400,,783,3.8209876543209877

The studio spent a phenomenal amount of money to produce this film just as musicals were going out of vogue in the late 1960's.  Too bad it was not a big hit.  I think it holds the test of time.  Streisand is FANTASTIC. Sings, dances, acts, great comedic timing.  Beautiful costumes and scenery.  Do some research on this era of American history (1890's) and research how they made this film.

There's a certain amount of joy that simply radiates throughout HELLO, DOLLY whether you listen to the albums or view of the movie. The cast is top rate. Barbra is in top form and there isn't a weak link in the cast. Marianne McAndrew is delightful as Irene; although she's dubbed, McAndrew is an absolute gem. Tommy Tune, Michael Crawford, and Danny Lockin are wonderful as the three supporting men. Walter Mathau is a gloriously grumpy Horace. Yes, he's not a great singer, but it works.
As for the production numbers, my favorites were - well - all of them! The only musical number I didn't care for was ""Love is Only Love"", but it doesn't hinder the overall picture.
Do yourself a favor, pop a bowl of popcorn, turn on this film, and be prepared to have a wonderful time in turn of the century New York City. Long live, DOLLY!",1393977600,,1108,4.601010101010101

The package had no indication that it was drop shipped as an Amazon order and had an address he did not recognize.  Inside was  a note saying ""Thank You"" and some gritty white powder, along with the dvd.  My friend and the building security guy were quarantined for 4 hours.  The entire building was shut down. Six haz-mat vehicles, Bomb Squad, 7 cop cars, a ladder truck from the fire department, FBI, FPS, and 2 news helicopters, were dispatched.  An immediate investigation into the owner of the residence on the return address ensued. Turns out he was a Saudi Arabian National but was renting the house to someone else.  Not kidding, all of this happened.  Best estimates are that this cost about $500k which surely could have been avoided if my order had been labeled as an Amazon order.  Of course I had no sympathy for my poor friend and when he relayed the story (after he was released from quarantine...boy was he mad) all I could do was laugh and try not to pee my pants.  Two days later the video was returned by the FBI who had perused it for anything bad since the dvd was not in its original celephane even though it was sold as new.

The only reason I'm rating it 4-stars is because of the poor streaming quality that Amazon provides. I have high speed DSL Internet (so it's not like I'm trying to stream this on a 14.4k dial-up connection). I thought this was important to mention because the movie stops, starts, loses its places. etc. quite frequently.  This can be annoying to some, so it may be worth it to just order the DVD based on personal preferences.",1380758400,,647,4.6173913043478265

Barbra Streisand does an absolutely fantastic job playing Dolly Levi. She delivers every line beautifully, every joke perfectly, and performs an endearing monologue with such grace.

A very young (26 year old) Barbra Streisand proved she could carry a major movie and hold her own against the likes of Walter Matthau and Micheal Crawford. She was, and is, a supreme talent and this movie gave her a perfect showcase for her unparalleled voice. And her acting and comedic timing are brilliant as well. The choreography is strong, the dancing superbly executed and director Gene Kelly brings his (in)famous perfectionism to bear.

My 3 girls(14,16,18) became interested in Hello Dolly, after they watched Disney's Wall-e a few years back; songs from Hello Dolly are peppered through out the film.

After watching it, they love the music even more.  Barbra Streisand and Michael Crawford were brilliant.  Walter Matthau plays a grumpy gentleman, in which he excels. And the ensemble was superb.

It was fun for the family. For me,  I loved seeing Tommy Tune and the Louie Armstrong cameo.  For the girls, they enjoyed the comedy and placing the songs from the animated film Wall-e.

Then I found a copy of it on vhs at a yard sale and figured ""eh,why not?"". After all, I have seen a number of actors who I ordinarily do not care for give what I consider to be excellent performances.
  Well,this is not one of those performances. There is nothing about Streisand's singing or acting that I liked. Luckily,I liked just about everything else about the film. All the other actors were delightful. Some of the songs were hilarious,and I enjoyed Gower Champion's silly,energetic choreography (which is no surprise considering that I loved his dancing in Show Boat). The film is upbeat and few of the jokes fail to elicit a chuckle. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is what makes the absurdity of the plot work. Honestly,the lead is pretty much the only low point in my mind. What saves the film for me is that many scenes have little or nothing to do with Dolly. I do not know who I would prefer in the lead role,although it probably would not be Channing.
  I liked the film so well,I plan to buy it on dvd and possibly make watching it a summer tradition. I am disappointed that the dvd has few extras and no commentary,but I will likely buy it anyway.

278183,4,6300246787,"Much has been said over the years about the mutual hatred between Walter Matthau and Barbra Streisand during filming of HELLO DOLLY!, and some of it's juicy enough to include here. When Matthau, who was sick of Streisand's meddling in his acting and in the decisions of director Gene Kelly, confronted her about it, they quickly got into a huge fight. Barbra called Walter ""old sewer mouth"" and he said she ""had no more talent than a butterfly's fart."" This continued until he sent her away crying with ""Nobody in this company likes you!"" Later, Matthau spoke to studio head Darryl Zanuck Jr. about Streisand's overbearing manner. Zanuck's dismissive reply was, 'I'd love to help you but this is not 'Hello, Walter' we're making.""

Somehow, production wrapped in September '68. On screen, only Matthau shows occasional hints of the disgust he had for his co-star.

In early scenes, Barbra, whose lower body was well-padded for the role of Dolly Levi, uses a modified Mae West impression for the matchmaking yente, but that is soon dropped in favor of her typical motor-mouthed Brooklynite schtick. She brings much talent to Jerry Herman's songs and is a fair dancer, as well.

Choreography is top-notch. Crawford, Tune and Lockin** are wonderful actors and hoofers. None of the film's main cast were in the original Tony-winning stageplay, which was performed nearly 3,000 times between 1/16/64 and 12/27/70. Despite the troubles detailed above, the cinematic HELLO DOLLY! is marvelous and highly recommended to all musical comedy lovers.

Film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical. Concerns itself with Dolly Levi, a New York-based matchmaker who merrily arranges things... like furniture and daffodils and lives. A widow, she has found herself in love with a ""half-a-millionaire"" Yonkers merchant named Horace Vandergelder. So she proceeds to weave a web of romantic complications involving him, his two clerks, a pretty milliner and her assistant.

But now one can enjoy this movie for what is - a happy-step, smile-on-your-face piece of escapism.  The movie moves quickly with quirky characters, fantastic songs, and some of the best mugging Streisand has ever put on film.

Barbra Stresisand is perfect as Dolly, bringing life and vitality to the character, as well as her beautiful singing voice.  Michael Crawford is excellent as Cornelius Hackl.  He's funny, charming and thoroughly believable.  Walter Matthau is great as a grumbling Horace Vandergelder.  Louis Armstrong adds his magic to the movie with his personality and his version of the title song. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery is too.  The music gets under your skin and is very catchy and can easily be sung along to.

After searching around fruitlessly in local stores to find that the movie is out of production and quite rare I came here to get a used copy for my daughter to watch. I had to pay an arm and a leg but after watching it again after over 2 decades I think it was worth every penny.
Definitely a trip down memory lane and great to see the young (I think 28 yr old)Barbara Streisand, Walter Matthau and Michael Crawford. I had forgotten how breathtaking some of the scenes were such as the entrance of Dolly into the Harmonia Gardens in that stunning gold dress.  For someone that has seen it before a long time ago and liked, buy it, it is a real feelgood movie.
For new viewers, this is a musical done in the old style that was popular 3 decades ago.  It might be hard to get used to it unless you like old musicals.  There is a lot of singing and dancing that nowadays looks a little out of place in a movie.  The movie cost over $20 million to make which was a lot in those days, it is reflected in the quality of the sets and costumes which are absolutely beautiful.",1043971200,16,1135,4.094594594594595

Horace wants a wife, but Dolly has her eye on Horace for herself.  His two naive shopclerks (Michael Crawford and Danny Locki) are along for the ride as they pay their first visit to New York City and vow to fall in love.

Forget the silly plot and the odd casting; Striesand is way too young for her part and Matthau is too old for his. But the movie is all about the lavish musical production numbers:  Streisand, Crawford, and Lockin sing and dance their way across an idyllic New York City, joined by hundreds of cityfolk. The songs are sweet and lovely and the choreography is energetic and dazzling. Some standout numbers are ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" and ""Look! I'm Dancing,"" and my favorite, ""It Only Takes a Moment.""

278239,4,6300246787,"Someone a few reviews down called it one of the happiest musical productions, and that's what does it for me!! For those of you looking for more anti-Barbra ammunition (too young for the role, too self-absorbed, etc.), consider that this was only her SECOND ever film and the one production she's shared with an extremely large cast. (And I personally don't hold Ms. Streisand's politics against her, even if so many, many, MANY others do.) The film is also one of the truest examples of a lavish movie musical, and it soars *because* of its fibre-optic thin plot of likable New Yorkers being romantically matched all over Yonkers just before the turn of the century. There are musical soliloquies from everyone-- from Streisand, Walter Matthau, clerks Michael Crawford and Danny Locklin, to hat mistress Marianne McAndrew, and dance turns with Locklin, E. J. Peaker, and the ridiculously gangly Tommy Tune. There's something for everyone in this very sweet, comic, tuneful film-- even jazz great Louis Armstrong!! Streisand is quite good as a 19th-century yenta, and even shows pathos in the film's softer moments like the ""Parade"" number (quietly speaking to the locket pic of her deceased), and my personal favorite, ""Love Is Only Love-"" staged through a bedroom window, showing Ms. Streisand unusually vulnerable, hair down and in a dressing gown- but incredibly beautiful.

278241,3,6300246787,"I can overlook the fact that Barbara Streisand is 20 years too young for the role of Dolly Levi; after all, Striesand works wonders with the show's songs and plays her scenes with enjoyable comic flair.  What I cannot overlook is the fact that the script could have been rewritten to accomodate the age change and it wasn't--and that's only the beginning in this movie that has a bigger budget than good sense.
The stage version of HELLO, DOLLY was actually a mid-size musical--but when the property went Hollywood a ton of money was poured into the film, and the result is a movie so determined to be BIG and FLASHY and LOUD that it cramed extras, chorus boys, period furniture, and every other expensive and unnecessary thing you can imagine into every square inch it could find.  As a result the whole thing feels about as light and airy and fun as Hoover Dam, and neither Gene Kelly's direction nor his skilled cast can hold it up.
The overall cast is pretty good and they all play rather well together.  As previously noted, Streisand gives a truly wonderful turn as Dolly Levi; Matthau is quite funny in an appropriately grumpy way; and all the supporting actors are well cast.  Although the choreography leaves a lot to be desired, the musical numbers are very entertaining, and Barbara and company occasionally manage to create one or two memorable moments--Louis Armstrong's cameo appearance among them.  But the film itself is awkward, clumsy and over-done. I can't help but think that it would have been a much better film if they had hired a good writer to resolve the age issue--and then cut the budget by about half and relied more upon imagination and creativity than upon bucks.

Watch for leggy Tommy Tune as the boyfriend of Vandergelder's niece.

He is an amazing actor and although he can't sing that great his superb acting and delightfully sarcastic humor makes up for it. Michael Crawford as Cornelius Hackel is so hilarious and amazingly adorable. His character is so lovable and the movie would not be funny without him. Hello Dolly is not just a movie for adults but for all ages and I love it so much that even after watching it over and over I never get tired of it. Hello Dolly is a classic movie and is one that should be cherished for many years and even centuries to come.",981504000,4,1141,4.543689320388349

278292,3,6300246787,"The first time I saw this, I thought it was terrible.  I have never been a Barbara Streisand fan, and this era of musicals was very hit or miss.  However, I was able to see the theatre production a few times and my  opinion was changed.  I guess I just got used to it, and was able to  appreciate it's peculiar flavor.
""Hello Dolly"" is a bit silly,  with a few catchy tunes.  Some of the tunes were more fleshed out in  ""Mame."" It has some great moments that have been strung together  and are worth watching the movie for.  The Louis Armstrong scene is one of  the best.  He brings an instant smile to the movie.  Michael Crawford is a  real scene stealer as Cornielius Hackle.  He and his friend Barnaby are the  most entertaining of the sub plots.  They also get one of the best songs,  ""Elegance.""  All of the romances are mismatched, in age, style,  and sheer scale.  Spider-legged Tommy Tune towers over Ermagarde in the  dance scenes, while Cornelius hooks up with a much older/more mature woman.  Walter Mathew is gruff and likeable. Everything is just a little bit off,  which helps contribute to the quirky nature of the film.
At the end of  the day, the only disappointment is Dolly herself.  Barbara Streisand is  annoying as the fast talking matchmaker.  It is really the supporting  characters that carry this musical.  But they do so very well.",958521600,4,1359,4.518672199170124

Every time this movie comes on TV i cancel everything for the rest of the day so i can watch it. Her  quick whit and sassy combacks make the movie so enjoyable. Many times i  can't stop laughing especially during the first song "" Just Leave  Everything to Me"". She talks so fast it's fun just to try and keep up.

278294,5,6300246787,"As a musical theatre fan, the film version of Hello Dolly! is one of my favorites.  This grand movie musical is incredible both because of the massive scope of the production and the performances of its stars.  So much  attention is given to the fact that Barbara S. was ""too young"" to  play the role of Dolly Levi.  Let me say this:  I've seen Carol Channing do  the part on stage...and the movie would have been ENTIRELY different with  her on the screen.  Barbara adds some incredible energy and fun that I  don't believe Channing would have carried on-screen.  I'm just waiting for  the DVD version to become available to purchase this CLASSIC must-have  film.  Did you know Hello Dolly! beat out WEST SIDE STORY for the Best  Musical Tony? I don't know why that happened.. but I do know that this is  one of the most entertaining films EVER.",950140800,4,846,4.54

If you forget that she is too young for the role, you will be impressed by her brilliantly  funny performance. Her duet with the great Louis Armstrong is fabulous! The  scene where she's feeding Walter Matthau beets is a scream. A really good  movie! (I've seen Channing on stage-she is the perfect Dolly-5 stars!)",933638400,3,438,4.8133333333333335
