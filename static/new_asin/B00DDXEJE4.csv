5793584,5,B00DDXEJE4,"I have to say, Vinegar Syndrome did an amazing job on this.  The image quality here is better than most DVDs, and considering this is from film made in the 70's, that's a great accomplishment.  The audio has its problems, but it's not bad, but I was really blown away by how clear the picture was.  The Sexualist is the higher quality film of the two, but both have been excellently transferred. Colors are rich, details are crisp, fleshtones maybe a bit on the pink side, but consistent for the time period, and contrast seemed spot on.  Throw a color chart in one of the scenes, and this could be used as a test disc for a home theater.",1376697600,23,638,4.336134453781512

8592397,1,B00DDXEJE4,"These Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but none stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,,531,4.709677419354839

8592399,3,B00DDXEJE4,"I'm conflicted.....in a big way. The picture quality of these films......especially ""Wendy's Palace"" is OUTSTANDING. What also caught my attention was the fact that the 2 films redefined the term ""widescreen"".......they took up EVERY INCH of my 55 inch big-screen........something you don't see everyday. However, quite a few of the sex scenes in the ""Sexualist"", and ALL OF THE SEX in ""Wendy's Palace"" was simulated.....which was a major turn-off for me. I could see this on late-night Cinemax.",1397520000,10,495,5.358974358974359
8592400,1,B00DDXEJE4,"I have a few of these ""Drive-In Collections"" from Vinegar Syndrome. This is the worst. The video quality is ""scanned 2k from 35mm camera negatives"" and of decent quality. Content on these two is nothing. Both of these selections are narrated with very little dialog.
The Sexualist 1973 89 minutes
There are three hardcore scenes in this one. All involve the same woman. One is a bj with money shot. The other two are intercourse scenes, but it's questionable who is actually doing the hardcore. In fact, the last scene there are shots of two different women's butts. I'm not even going to mention the story line. They actually have as extras for this the trailer and outtakes. I think they included the ""rare"" outtakes to show how well they cleaned up the video. Too bad they couldn't do better with the action.
Wendy's Palace 1971 72 minutes
Plenty of explicit nudity, but all softcore. You'll see better on Cinemax. This does include the trailer for what it's worth.

Pass on this selection. There are much better of these collections.",1386720000,18,1037,4.761111111111111
8592401,5,B00DDXEJE4,Both movies had decent plots great looking women that takes it off what more can you ask for. I enjoyed them.,1382313600,4,109,4.238095238095238
8592402,4,B00DDXEJE4,"""The Sexualist"" indeed is a good film that captures a moment in time particularly the late 60's mid 70's era.  When everyone was having free sex and tried to film it.  This shows a lot of real straight sex scenes and raunchy humor.  I like it, but a few scenes I believe have been edited out.  In ""Wendy's Palace""  again this film captures the times of the early 70's with a bit of a story line and plot.  Lots of lesbian sex, while a lot of the straight sex has been edited out.  Over all this film gets a 4 star rating for I like vintage films and this one is a keepers sake.",1378425600,19,577,4.008771929824562
