2611480,5,B000GH3PNQ,"What a great series! They could have stopped at the end of this session.  Session 6 doesn't have the punch as all the rest. What ever reason Alistair MacKenzie left the show...it left it without it's unity of characters.  Since they introduced Archie's half-brother Paul in this session the producers knew Alistair was goin to leave the show, at least it looks that way.  What a pity.  I did LOVE the first 5 sessions and I say thank you for those!!!",1194220800,2,450,4.518518518518518
2611481,3,B000GH3PNQ,"Well I enjoyed the last 4 series, but I am getting a little leery with the changes. They are losing there characters and I am losing interest fast. Its hard to fall in love with the characters that add so much to the drama, and then the writers are taking this to a whole other series.",1190160000,6,285,4.107142857142857
2611482,5,B000GH3PNQ,"This season the show moves in an expanded direction, the stories are better, and the scenery is just as spectacular as always.",1174262400,,126,4.7727272727272725
2611483,5,B000GH3PNQ,I enjoyed this series on BBC America and I have enjoyed it on DVD. I can't wait for Series 6 to be available. Great characters and setting.,1172448000,,139,4.185185185185185
2611484,5,B000GH3PNQ,"Although not as good as the first and second seasons, this was definitely worth 5 stars!",1171584000,,88,4.5625
2611485,5,B000GH3PNQ,"Excellent purchase!  Don't start with this one, go back to Series One and enjoy for a lifetime!",1171152000,,95,4.588235294117647
2611486,4,B000GH3PNQ,"As a diehard Monarch fan, I will gobble up as much of it as I can get! But I wouldn't claim season 5 as their best.  As ever though, the scenery is astounding and the characters always intriguing.

Not to give too much away, Duncan makes a quizzical (read: poor) dating choice, Molly gets swept up in a rollercoaster of love of her own, Paul makes another appearance with a difficult request, and Archie and Lexie face maybe the biggest, toughest decision of their relationship. Of course, some new faces make their entrances, and most importantly, a few dearly loved faces make their exits.

So for those (like me) who love it all, this collection is a must-have. But for those who prefer to cherry-pick the series, I'd recommend seasons 1 and 3 as the best of all.",1168819200,7,766,4.536231884057971
2611487,5,B000GH3PNQ,"Having spent time ---6 years--- in the British Isles, seeing and hearing the continued Monarch series is like 'going home'. The scripts and quality of the programming leaves my Bride and I anxiously awaiting the next release. Thanks again to the cast and writers of Monarch. Don & Nola",1168300800,,285,4.836734693877551
2611488,5,B000GH3PNQ,"We were introduced to Monarch of the Glen a couple of years ago when visiting relatives.  We watched several episodes in one evening, were immediately hooked, and rushed to add the series to our own collection.  From the first episode, we were enchanted by the beautiful Scottish countryside and the cast of eccentric and amusing characters.  Series 5 continues the saga of the MacDonald's, with all their distant relatives, meddling neighbors, and myriad of problems that go along with keeping a large estate afloat. The episodes are often hilarious yet they can be equally touching. The stories are appealing to young and old alike. My college-age children are already asking me when Series 6 will be coming out.  We definitely can't get enough.  We highly recommend this delightful series!",1168300800,2,792,5.108527131782946
2611489,5,B000GH3PNQ,"I am not a big fan of tv in general but this series has captured my attention like no other.  Each day I look forward to 1 hour of uninterrupted adventure when I watch this show.  I have bought this series in its entirety and when I am done watching it once I will watch it all over again, it is that brilliant.  Not only is the scenery the BEST I have ever seen on a show, but it makes me laugh out loud and cry all in the same show.  I have grown quite attached to each and every character on this gem of a show.  I have just come back from Scotland for the second time, and this show lets me feel like I am still there for at least 1 hour a day.  It  makes me want to buy a second house in the highlands of scotland, just outside of Edinburgh.  I don't think I am so different from many of you out there, and I can't recommend this show highly enough.  To those of you who long for a beautifully written and filmed adventure, this is the series you have been waiting for.  I know it has been that for me and much more.",1166140800,8,1021,3.8653846153846154
2611500,5,B000GH3PNQ,This is a great series - my husband and I have really enjoyed it.,1424044800,,65,3.7142857142857144
2611501,5,B000GH3PNQ,I had to buy this twice as one of the discs would not work and I waited too long to return it.,1423008000,4,94,3.3181818181818183
2611502,5,B000GH3PNQ,Everything was great with this seller and the product,1422489600,,53,5.0
2611503,3,B000GH3PNQ,"My wife and I are very fond of this series.  Although the fifth season is probably not the best and also sees the departure of the main player (Archie), it stays quite entertaining.
However, as already reported by several other reviewers, there seems to a widespread technical issue with the third disc of this DVD set.
This third disc, although it does not show any sign of damage, will simply not play with any DVD or Blu-Ray player.
I personally own 5 DVD and 5 Blu-Ray players and I have tested this third disc in every one of them, to no avail.  The only thing that ever happens is that you get a ""No Disc"" or ""Error"" signal.
I have even gotten a replacement third disc from my marketplace vendor, but this disc does not play either.
On the other hand, wanting to know how the series end, I have borrowed this this DVD set from our public library and the third disc of that set did play without any issues.  The only difference I could see is that the library set came in a thinner box where the last two discs both snap on the back of the box instead of being held on separate flaps.
I do believe that there is a whole batch of these DVD sets out there with a defective third disc and that the manufacturer should do something about that.",1418083200,5,1244,4.262711864406779
2611504,3,B000GH3PNQ,Disc one and two are great but Disc 3 does not play.,1417132800,4,52,3.4166666666666665
2611505,3,B000GH3PNQ,"I have ordered this DVD twice (yes, twice) as a gift for my parents. Both times, Disc 3 would not load onto their DVD player.  Discs 1 and 2 played just fine, so I don't think it is an issue with their machine. My parents thoroughly enjoyed the series up until the errant disc. I don't know if anyone else encountered this problem, but it is very frustrating to give someone a present and it not be up to snuff.",1414886400,3,411,4.1375
2611506,4,B000GH3PNQ,Won't be ordering any more now that they took the main charachter off.,1410739200,,70,4.461538461538462
2611507,3,B000GH3PNQ,"The series has been most pleasant and entertaining: that is, up to season 5. The taint of simple-minded socialism has driven me away. Don't the writers realize that, without primogeniture, there would be no Glen Bogle? The area would probably have all the charm  of Albania.",1405728000,2,274,4.956521739130435
2611508,3,B000GH3PNQ,"As far as the series goes, it's great. Very interesting and fun. The problem I had was with the third DVD not working so I can't comment on that part of Series 5. I sent the third DVD back and asked for a replacement. I received another (?) DVD that also did not work. It just pixilates and freezes and is unusable. I would have loved to see the last part of series 5 but alas...with this product, I could not.",1388448000,4,410,4.074074074074074
2611509,5,B000GH3PNQ,"Great, great , great, super enjoyable, I love the box set - it is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon (and evening) , the scenery, the characters and the story are each wonderful",1388016000,2,182,4.228571428571429

2611531,5,B000GH3PNQ,Love the show and would recommend it to anyone who likes a well produced program and well rounded characters.  Thank you.,1361923200,,121,4.761904761904762
2611532,5,B000GH3PNQ,"We, my wife and I , first watched this series while we were living in New Zealand. We we captured from the first episode we watched. We finally found  the DVD's of the series on line. This is without doubt the very best series ever produced. The actors are 'spot on' serving up characters that you want to know and have as friends and neighbors. The setting, Scottish Highlands,is superb, I know where the Creator goes  for R&R. The stories are examples of what great writing should be.  We have Seasons 1 through 5 and we'll be getting the remaining 3 seasons in the coming weeks. A must see. Hope that you grow to love Glenbogle as much as we do.",1329609600,5,648,4.338842975206612
2611533,5,B000GH3PNQ,I love this series.  I have been watching for a couple of years now. I like to watch them over again.  Love the location.  It's beautiful.,1319846400,,138,4.230769230769231
2611534,4,B000GH3PNQ,"We had seen the previous four eagerly, but had been told they didn't stay as good following Series Four.  We disagree and enjoy the stories, characters, interaction, and human truths.  We will probably try the Series Six.",1305590400,,221,4.945945945945946
2611535,2,B000GH3PNQ,"I liked the series, but the way they developed it over the years it clearly began to turn it into a tool for socialist propaganda.  It becamae more and more annoying.",1293667200,,166,4.354838709677419
2611536,4,B000GH3PNQ,This series isn't bad but series 6 and 7 fell apart as far as I'm concerned.,1277337600,,76,3.8125
2611537,1,B000GH3PNQ,"While I'm a huge fan of the first two series of Monarch of the Glen, this series really just fails to live up to any kind of a standard.  With Jullian Fellowes as Killwillie out of the picture and no more Hector, it seems this series just tries to aim for tackiness.  I do recommend the first two series highly as they are intriguing and provide an interesting insight into Scottish Highland customs, but this installment is just at best overbearing.  The plot lines are forced and the general message is cheapness.  I really don't even think it is worth bothering with.  Sorry to be negative, but I'm not sure what the BBC was thinking on this one.",1266192000,,649,4.466101694915254
2611538,5,B000GH3PNQ,"Great every moment, keep you on the edge with humor like only BBC can deliver.",1240012800,,78,4.266666666666667
2611539,5,B000GH3PNQ,"This was a wonderful British TV series.  However I only caught 2 or 3 shows out of each year, so the story was very confusing.  These dvd's are setting the story straight for me.  The characters and the sceney are wonderful.  I am planning to get the rest of the series.  These stories are something you can enjoy over and over again and always find something new to laugh about.  If you can't afford a trip to Scotland these dvds are the next best thing!
Thanks!",1225324800,,463,4.325581395348837
8132169,5,B000GH3PNQ,"I bought series six to fill in for ones lost from our library collection. Sadly, it was defective. The second disc would not play.
But...the show is great. Just sorry that we missed several episodes.",1499299200,,199,4.714285714285714

8132171,3,B000GH3PNQ,"Season 5 was basically like Return of the King, Return of the Jedi, HP and the Deathly Hallows, etc...I was overcome with grief that it was the last one. The show actually ran for 7 seasons, but I chose it to be the last season I watch since so many characters leave after this one. I feel like Glenbogle kind of lost its charm in this season, because so many things had changed since it first started. The estate is back on its feet, which is a good change but other changes just made the episodes feel kind of empty. I do not regret watching it at all, because it brought somewhat of a closure for me personally. I think the series should have ended here, but for some reason they continued. I cannot speak for Season 6 and 7 since I did not watch them, but Seasons 1-5 were so much fun to watch!",1473465600,2,798,4.15483870967742

8132173,2,B000GH3PNQ,"I am writing this past the 30 days return policy so I take responsibility for that. It took me awhile to watch all the episodes due to a busy life. I wanted to let you know that the last disc w the last 2 episodes did not work. I only received an error message, saying that the disc could not be read. I hoped that spending more money would get me a real set of original discs not bad copies.",1464134400,2,392,3.9125
8132174,2,B000GH3PNQ,"Spoilers! Spoilers! Spoilers!. Monarch of the Glen unfortunately succumbed to the same forces that brought down many other shows. The writers ran out of material and pivotal actors left the show. When they killed off Hector, they lost the tension between the old and the new, characterized by Hector vs. Archie. Without this tension the show lost much of its meaning.

Also, I loved the irony caused by the childish antics of Hector and his neighbor laird Killwillie at odds with the younger Archie struggling to provide maturity and responsibility as the new laird. When Hector left they lost this dynamic and the show lost a lot of it's appeal. There's a couple of good episodes immediately after they kill off Hector, but after that it turns into a bad soap opera.

The first three seasons, though, were top notch.",1459382400,,817,4.828571428571428
8132175,2,B000GH3PNQ,"As mentioned in previous email . . . Episode 2 of disc #2 was not viewable (""jerky"" & inaudible).  The same for entire disc #3.  Request replacement set so we can proceed with the story and then, purchase the remaining seasons.  Thank you.",1441065600,3,239,4.511627906976744
8132176,4,B000GH3PNQ,"We liked this show which was recommended by a family member. Great cast, love stories, comedy, and drama all in one. Duncan's character is a bit over the top some times but love Golly and Molly (inspired by song lyrics??).",1434326400,,222,4.575
8132177,5,B000GH3PNQ,This series is among our all time favorites. We've come to love the Highlands even more as well as my Scottish heritage. We've watch every episode probably 20 times.,1433548800,,165,4.724137931034483
