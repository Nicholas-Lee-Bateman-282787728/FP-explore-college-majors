3546693,5,B001E6V2Q0,"I saw this when I was in college on a film projector and the film blew me away. It was in black and white and it was very informative and educational. I begged my professor to get me a copy of this and she did. She put it on a VHS tape that I had for years that I showed to company for many years. The tape was 'lost, stolen or strayed'...and I periodically looked for it online and when I saw this I INSTANTLY purchased it. I received it THE NEXT DAY and watched it with my wife. It's one of those documentaries that you never forget. Bill Cosby handled this subject like a thoroughbred. And to my surprise, the DVD version of this is in COLOR!!! Amazingly clear, and there's only one word for the message and how it was presented: POWERFUL!!",1295049600,2,743,4.166666666666667

8296907,3,B001E6V2Q0,"Pretty disappointed with this, I mean yes it is pretty old but it doesn't have much information. I was looking for something of the caliber of Hidden Colors and this is NOT that. I mean it is ok to watch one time but I didn't get anything from having seen it, doesn't make me think or question anything, it is just ok....was nice to see a young Bill Cosby though.",1401148800,,363,4.2
8296908,5,B001E6V2Q0,This video is a excellent tool to introduce children to African American History. The language used is easily understood and flows directly from one point to the next.,1388880000,,167,5.0
8296909,5,B001E6V2Q0,"Bill Cosby tells Black History in a way that helps anybody understand why disparities in education, self esteem and health exists between Blacks and Whites. He highlights a study which was presented in the 50's/60's that show that media and the negative portrayal of Blacks as less intelligent, less cultured, less industrious, less attractive and the positive portrayal of Whites in the affirmative greatly affected the way Black children saw themselves and the way White children saw Blacks also. This study was updated in the 2000's and demonstrated that the negative affect still exits among Black and White children. In the study dolls were used and the children were asked to choose one. Black children chose the White doll because they thought it was pretty and smart. The White children did not select any Black dolls because they thought they were ugly and dumb.

8296910,5,B001E6V2Q0,"I remember this video vaguely when I was in college back in the early 90's.  I just happened to be at a buddy's place on a Friday and we were drinking messing around.  I'll never forget. We both thought we were pretty smart, always challenging each other in answering ""Jeopardy"" questions.  Once this video came on the local PBS channel, we stopped in our tracks. We noticed it was Bill Cosby, but we also noticed something else.. He wasn't laughing, he wasn't the jovial, cool, level headed white collar father we all knew and loved and were familiar with.  This Bill was stern, to the point and dead serious, almost in a ""Black Panther""-ish tone.  We loved it.

We both watched, glued to the screen by the words, the images, the context in which he used and showed.  This documentary helped open my eyes to blatant racism that social media helped perpetuate thru tv and movies and out of all people to show me this, it was Bill Cosby.  This documentary was the first to open many doors in my mind that made me question what I viewed, what I found funny and what should really matter. It made me proud to be black but it also made me angry to see what we were subjected to.

For the past 15-16 years I've been unable to find this video, until now. As soon as I came across it on Amazon, I immediately purchased it. This video along with ""Hidden Colors"" documentary by Tariq Nasheed and ""Classified X"" by Melvin Van Peebles should be required viewing for all ""Americans"" ESPECIALLY BLACK AMERICANS.

If people are easily influenced by the commercials they see or the movies they watch then this documentary explains why Blacks have suffered so much in society. The mental effects of slavery still exist and it's reiterated through the images we've seen in movies and commercials. Could this partially be the reason why ""black Relationships"" have failed before they've started?

All in all, this is a wonderful documentary. It is dated, but so very relative to today's society. I applaud Bill for being the first to KEEP IT REAL in this documentary. If everyone would view this they would see Bill in a totally different light. Thank you Bill for helping open my eyes and so many others. BUY THIS DVD, SHOW YOUR FRIENDS, SHOW YOUR KIDS..  SHOW EVERYONE.",1305676800,4,2252,4.6025
8296911,5,B001E6V2Q0,"In 1972, the American bases and garrisons in Korea were gripped by racial tension.  The Air Training Command sent out a train-the-trainers team for ""Human Relations Officers.""  It was during the two week course that I first saw ""Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed.""  It had a powerful impact on me and the other airmen.  It is still powerful.

I have long waited for the documentary, first made in 1968 for CBS News, to be available on DVD.  On screen was a very young Bill Cosby, then known for his role in the ""I, Spy"" television series.  Andy Rooney, now of ""Sixty Minutes"" fame, wrote the script, winning an Emmy Award.

Forty years have passed since the film was made.  How does it stand up?  The 54 minute program easily breaks into parts.

In the first, set in a classroom, Cosby introduces African Americans who made an impact in U.S. history but were never recognized in the history books.  This is informative, and Cosby's manner sets the stage for the next, more serious sequences.

Part two focuses on the mental legacy of slavery and discrimination, with psychologist Emanuel Hammer using his projective drawing interpretation analysis and showing Person/Tree/House drawings made by black and white children.

The third part has the most punch.  It's hard for whites to watch, and it angers some African Americans.  It shows clips from Hollywood films running from ""Birth of a Nation"" through ""Guess Who's Coming for Dinner.""  The clips show more than racist stereotyping -- Cosby points out that they played to white assumptions and profoundly affected the self-image of African Americans too.  After watching these clips, it's hard to watch old movies the same way.

The next part uses children's paintings to illustrate how even young African Americans can be stunted by the racial attitudes around them.

The final part shows the efforts of John Elliott Churchville at the Freedom Library Day School in Philadelphia to develop the self-esteem and self-confidence of African American students by pushing back against racial stereotyping.

The film is ""dated,"" for sure.  It's look is oh-so-sixties.  It awaits a good retrospective.  How does the research on children's paintings hold up?  How would 21st century educators evaluate Churchville's classroom methods?  And what do we think of Bill Cosby's final telling points about ""brainwashing""?  Even so, this is a powerful documentary.  It provokes as much thinking now as it did when I first saw it back in 1972.
