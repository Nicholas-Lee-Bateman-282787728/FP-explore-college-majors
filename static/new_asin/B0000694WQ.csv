7965020,1,B0000694WQ,was not what I exspected. The story line was not good as it could have been maybe a little more action.,1397260800,,103,3.9523809523809526
7965021,5,B0000694WQ,"Great title. If you like machines duking it out, this is a short series for you.

The animation is well done and the story is relatively bloodless. Mostly just metal on metal.

For its time its really well done.",1385769600,,211,4.384615384615385
7965022,5,B0000694WQ,I would watch Heavy Gear all the time in the UK. I look for it here on US tv and couldn't find it. I like to have all of them.,1358467200,,126,3.2333333333333334
7965023,3,B0000694WQ,"Heavy Gear is a CGI animated show, derived from a videogame of the same name, about the adventures of young mechanic who gets to realize his dream of becoming a robot warrior.
While the graphics and animation are extremely well done, the show is clearly targeted at a fairly young audience (8-13).  Older viewers expecting a show with the sophistication of Starship Troopers will be disappointed.  Each episode is more or less a 1/2 hour CGI movie that feels like a video game session (put a bunch of robots in an arena and fight it out with a bare semblance of a plot).",1035849600,2,570,4.524271844660194
7965024,5,B0000694WQ,I loved the CG series and this DVD brings out some great episodes.  There aren't to many episode but it's thrilling and action packed.  A collectors item for any Heavy Gear fan.,1031270400,,177,4.5
