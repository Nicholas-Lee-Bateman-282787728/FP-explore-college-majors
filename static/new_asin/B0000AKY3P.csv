7997650,1,B0000AKY3P,"I ordered this thing several times and each time, after a week or so, I got an email saying that it was out of stock. That scenario continued for years. I finally found the filmmaker who made ""More"" from this collection, and bought THAT short directly from him. It was great. Too bad that Amazon was never able to get it together with this item.",1178928000,,345,4.323076923076923
7997651,5,B0000AKY3P,"This disc proves that the Resfest DVDs are NOT strictly a showcase for digital films.  Two outstanding stop-motion shorts are included on this volume: ""More"" and ""Dog"".  Mark Osborne's ""More"" is, without question, one of the truly great animated films -- a parable about passion and routine, simple pleasures and self-satisfaction.  It's been included on other anthologies, but if you've missed it - SEE IT HERE!  Suzie Templeton's (nice to see the work of women directors get some visibility, I might add) ""Dog"" is dark, deep and harrowing.  A quiet tension builds between son and father, infecting the scene and giving it an urgency not often seen in a short film.
That's all I can say.  The rest of the films are good, as always, but if the disc were to only include the two stop-motion marvels, it would still be well worth the price.  Enjoy!",1074038400,11,846,4.7534246575342465
