3062290,5,B00116495O,"This is an amazing documentary comprised of many interviews and a lot of footage from meetings and personal encounters where miracles of various kinds were taking place.  Some of the miraculous healings occur on camera.  But the bottom line on this documentary is not just that God is doing amazing things in the earth through people, but that loving people is more important than working miracles.  The miracles are only a tool, only a delivery package, for the love that God wants to show through people.",1203724800,27,506,4.8604651162790695
3062291,5,B00116495O,"This DVD is the most convincing collection of film footage for the current outpouring of Holy Spirit that I have seen.  It documents the current world revival that many are now experiencing, and puts to death the rumor that God isn't actively involved in the lives of regular, ordinary people.  Signs, wonders, and miracles are clearly and convincingly documented.  There is very little fanfare, just concrete, objective reporting.  For those who long for more....let ths be your launching pad into the supernatural manifestation of God's presence in your own life.",1202601600,15,565,5.2444444444444445
3062292,5,B00116495O,Well done. Looking forward to future works from this artist. Challenging content with a genuine search for answers. And it turns out there's treasure in that field. Buy it and see for yourself.,1202515200,5,193,4.878787878787879
3062293,5,B00116495O,"The supernatural attracts me. Sometimes I'm skeptical, sometimes gullible, sometimes convinced, but I'm always interested.  The Finger of God stirred neither doubt or blind faith, it left me excited and rationally convinced--if anyone can be rational about miracles.  I've watched it more than once, and I'll watch it again. Each time I it, I see and hear something new.  Something that challenges me and provokes me to rise above the unbelief of my culture.  There's an energy about it that inspires me-- and pushes me closer to God.  This is not a movie for fence sitters,  it may enrage the pharisees to criticism and release the saints to ask for more of God.",1201737600,64,663,4.823008849557522
3062294,5,B00116495O,"What an awesome and amazing film! I love the honesty and integrity that shines through as the film maker so openly shares his journey with us. This movie has true and beautiful artistic expression, stellar cinematography, encourages you, and does an amazing job of presenting a level of spirituality that is both heart felt, deep, meaningful, and real! This film has the power to change lives and already is doing that.....so why not start or take another step on your journey with God by purchasing and watching this film. Share it with friends, neighbors, family, and watch as you see the power of God unleashed in yours and their lives. Ponder, Soak, Ask, Seek, Explore, Receive, Be healed, and Be encouraged as you watch the film.  Thank you Darren and all who were involved for taking this bold step and presenting us with a film that reflects the Fathers heart in so many ways. A hundred hand claps..and Gods continued blessings and rich increase of anointing upon you all!",1199404800,19,979,4.792899408284024
3062295,5,B00116495O,"This movie changes the way a person thinks of God! We've put Him in a box according to our limitations. But He is not limited. His normal for us is so far beyond what we live, and this movie propels me to want more---to live in God's normal, which is to change people's lives no matter what the circumstances. My first response to someone's sickness needs to be, ""can I pray for you? God wants to touch you!""",1199232000,22,408,4.243589743589744
3062296,5,B00116495O,"This movie will completely shift your thoughts on what we as Christians are supposed to be doing here on earth for the kingdom.  It shows how when ordinary people step out and love the way Jesus intended us to and actually DO the ministry of Jesus, the kingdom comes and lives are changed.  It will transform your life!!",1199232000,22,320,4.5
3062297,5,B00116495O,"This documentary will alter your preconceptions about how God works today, even if you have wondered if there is a God at all! In a series of fascinating interviews and live footage, the director takes us from the USA, where inexplicable 'miracles' occur to very ordinary people, to many other parts of the globe, which I found even more interesting, showing incredible surges of Christian growth, inspired or fueled by miraculous events and healings.  I have heard many times of such things, and was not sure how to think about it, as I had no independent means of verification.  With this movie, you can actually see people being healed of deafness, and lameness, and hear a first hand account of a man being raised from the dead (from the man himself).  I know it sounds unbelievable, but you should see it.  There's no trickery, just Christians sincerely praying for people.  Check it out, it will blow you away!",1199232000,23,916,4.772151898734177
3062298,5,B00116495O,"This film will destroy all the images of pasty-faced, up-tight, crabby, hypocritical Christianity that are out there.  You see people who genuinely love God and because of that, also love others.  Real Christianity lived out in normal, everyday lives, showing the world around them an incredible, personal God.  And this film will leave you with a desire to live that way as well.  No more stilted religion, but a living, breathing relationship with a God more real than anything we can see here on Earth.  Life changing!",1199232000,59,521,4.942528735632184
3062299,5,B00116495O,"Ever wondered if miracles really happen?  Think the age of miracles is past?  Think again!  The film maker claims to have captured miracles occurring in real time, and he delivers.  In this film, the director goes world-wide documenting God's supernatural move on the earth today.  You'll see footage from the US, Mozambique Africa, China, Bulgaria...I can't even remember all the places.  You really do see deaf ears opened and the lame healed.  This is the most powerful evidence for the existence of the God of the Bible I've ever encountered.  If you want to have your faith built, your heart encouraged, and maybe your theology challenged, you need to see this film.",1197849600,93,671,4.928571428571429
3062350,5,B00116495O,"This video wrecked me for ordinary Christianity. I can never go back to a common pew sitter anymore. Having experienced the miraculous, healing, demonic deliverance, spiritual warfare, and more, a guy can NEVER go back having experienced God and his presence. He's the real deal, and this video will start you on that journey to finding out for yourself!",1494720000,,354,5.016949152542373

3062353,1,B00116495O,I do believe I miracles but this is bad.  When the student was trying to heal the guys leg he didn't talk about God at all.  It should all be more about God.  (It didn't really seem like the guys leg was really healed anyway).  Why would God give people gold teeth?,1490227200,,265,4.038461538461538
3062354,2,B00116495O,"For charismatic Christians, it is great for opening up your mind to what miracles can occur in modern times, but this could have been much better in gaining more believers from other sectors of belief systems. For skeptics, I would not recommend this. It seems to be intended for an audience that isn't so sure if miracles still occur, but delivered in a way that is only useful to those Christians who are already familiar with faith healing and Pentecostal manifestations, Bethel Church, JHOP and the like. For your Methodists, Presbyterians, theology heavy minded folks, not so much. It is important when presenting these miracle stories to provide simple supporting evidence or testimonies, but the director fails to do so in any credible form. For example, for those who received ""gold teeth,"" a simple interview from the person's long time dentist can verify the change.",1489622400,,876,5.048275862068966

Then the credits rolled and for some reason I kept watching and am I glad I did. I have a back problem and have put off surgery but do ok, However, the last 3 days the pain spread from 1 hip to the other. I could hardly walk, my toes were numb and I was thinking time for an operation. During the end credits Sid Roth prays  and I was healed, 9 years after the films release. It is a film everyone should see.",1477785600,,513,4.13

3062403,1,B00116495O,"I feel like there could definitely be something demonic behind this film. I'm sorry, but I personally do not believe that a human could know anything about anyone else upon just meeting them. The only reason Jesus could do this is because He IS God.

Second I do not like how it is implied that if we are not out seeking to heal the physically sick then we aren't a ""good"" Christian. Some people are not called to serve others in this way. Paul clearly states this in 1 Corinthians chapter 12.

Third, being a Christian is not about ""what miracle can I get from God?"" Being a Christian is about having faith in the fact that Jesus died for our sins and then was raised again on the third day.

I do believe that there are miracles and that God blesses, however, these blessings are not always instantaneous. I had a very serious infection and I was blessed in the fact that I had gotten to the doctor before it had gotten any worse and that it healed quite quickly, I was blessed in the fact that I had a skilled doctor taking care of me. However at the same time I am still waiting on another blessing. Also sometimes God will say no to us. God is not someone that we just get handouts from.

Stay away from this movie. There are many false prophets that can easily lead people astray.",1477267200,,1286,4.279835390946502

3062460,1,B00116495O,"I believe in God and in miracles, but this documentary fails to prove anything. A whole bunch of church people receiving gold teeth from God? seriously?! gold dust? manna? gemstones? Disturbing. The latter portion of the film was better - the focus shifted away from magical presents from God to people having faith and leading Spirit filled lives. It's kind of disappointing that there was not a single verified miracle in this film. lots of people talking about miracles, but none of it captured on film or verified by doctors, etc. I think this film could give unbelievers or new believers misinformation. seriously, no manna is going to show up in your bible.",1463270400,3,663,4.876106194690266

3062464,3,B00116495O,"I am a Christian and one of my Pastors talked about this in a way that made me want to watch it... as if I was missing out on something.  I was a movie buff for a while but had never heard of this film.  Also, I particularly love movies based on true stories as well as real documentaries.  I have mixed feelings about this movie that I'll succinctly put this way.  1. If you are a ""mature"" Christian in that you have a deep and well rounded objective understanding of real life and scripture, you should be able to discern for yourself whatever you want to take away from this.  There are wonderful and beautiful nuggets of miracles, selflessness, obedience, sacrifice, and true faith.  However, I personally found some aspects of this film very disturbing.  2. If you are a new and young Christian, it is quite possible you could be grossly turned off or completely misled.  I fear this might be the case for many who view and that saddens me.  3. If you are agnostic, have atheistic tendencies, or are from a completely other religion, I wonder what you think.  Finally, all I can say is this.  I'm no expert and everyone will have an opinion.  I'll just say that I believe much of this film misrepresents TRUE Christian faith.  The confusing part is that much of the film is a great representation of good solid Christian teachings as well.  Christ came to love not to condemn.  He came to forgive sins and to show his people love.  His miracles consisted of healing, befriending the unfriend-worthy, the wretched, the wicked.  He shared, gave, sacrificed and humbled himself.  He did not flash jewels, flaunt strength to the weak, oppress, give gold dust or money.  That's not what he was or is about.",1460332800,4,1706,4.552631578947368

3062641,1,B00116495O,"Let me say from the outset that I am not a Christian but I believe in God just do not believe that you have accept Jusus Christ as your savior to witness a miracle. I am constantly in a state of prayer and surrender as well and have experienced my own form of miracles and very clear guidance from God.
I had to stop watching the movie about three quarters of the way into it because I really could not take the implication that the God that was being referred to here was only the Lord, God, Jesus - really?  Do not think that the mind that conceived the Sermon On the Mount would applaud your denigration of all other religions by implication.
Do you really believe that Christ would cause farmers who were not Christian to lose their crop? What kind of love is that.???
To see a movie like this in a day and age when the biggest calling we have is to respect and love one another is actually quite disturbing.
Quite sure that if you would research other religions and seek out miracles in those you will find the same thing.
The bottom line is to learn to live and walk and act as an act of worship and appreciation and yes- expectation that you are loved and will experience the miracle of divine guidance.

3062728,1,B00116495O,"This film is about people having massive religious experiences in Jesus's precious name. A religious experience, or being healed, doesn't mean you automatically have salvation.  It's supposed to point to the Savior, and even then, there must be belief and repentance. I""m guessing for many in this vein of Christianity, salvation or doctrine is vast and empty and not very important.

I hope all those people in the film truly are/were healed. But do they have saving faith in Jesus Christ for the repentance of sins? In the end, who knows? True faith in Jesus Christ does not need a sign or a wonder, for it rests solely on the finished work of the cross. I wonder how addicted are people to signs and wonders? If something exciting didn't happen, would it be less of a worship? Have signs and wonders become an idol in exchange for simple, reasonable faith? From this film, I got the impression that traditional, orthodox, daily faith in the forgiveness of sins is not good enough. Let me tell you about a miracle that outshines any on this film. The transformation of a sinful, hell-bent soul on a war path to perishing, turn 180 degrees around and completely sanctified at the end of their life by the indwelling Holy Spirit due to simple, daily belief in Jesus Christ crucified, risen, and coming again. That's the only miracle you need! And it happens to every believer, whether or not anyone notices.

Finger of God is perfect for our experience driven, emotional high-addicted culture.  And, look, we are planting more of these churches overseas. Did you see Heidi Baker talking to the pastor in Turkey, just after they prayed for Muslim woman? Heidi just wanted to ""love"" this woman by praying for her. OK, that's fine, That's nice. But, the pastor wanted to create a disciple, it seemed. Isn't that what he's supposed to do? But, then he goes and gets lectured by Heidi that he is not loving enough.

The Bible predicts a MASSIVE falling away of the church in the end times, and signs, hearings, and wonders will play a heavy role in it, confusing many. How does this happen? People stop questioning, and stop studying the Word and stop examining their hearts before God, falling away from biblical truth, and start having religious experiences. It's clothed in attractiveness! I am NOT saying that the people displayed in this film - the hungry crowds, or the people healed or raised from the dead - are not truly christians. I am not saying that. What I AM saying is that this film is promoting a type of religion that, swallowed whole, can deceive massive amounts of followers and lead people away from the cross and salvation.

In this film,  I saw a lot of subjective anecdotal experiences. I saw a lot of people avidly praying, pridefully commanding God down to do their will, without the gospel being spoken or communicated thoughtfully. I saw a lot of people who were being ""healed"" looking confused and maybe even awkwardly distressed, careful not to be rude.  I heard a lot about how the gospel is all about a wide, unoffensive, generic, culturally defined ""love"", but not the sort of love that died on the cross, and asks us to do the same. It's just never mentioned. Maybe that was an oversight. Or, maybe it's assumed. Sorry, but I feel like this movie was really terrible.",1409702400,15,3296,4.710069444444445

It was such a powerful film that I ended up purchasing the basic (non deluxe) edition and sharing it with my family and friends (and everyone was in awe of the film).  Then, as usual, I gave it as a gift to someone and decided to repurchase another copy for myself.  That is when I stumbled across the Special Edition version and I knew I had to have it.  So much bonus footage that was cut due to time in the original is available in this package and was well worth paying extra for.  More documented faith healings, more heart touching scenes, and even documented cases live of people being raised from the dead by the power of Jesus.  One of my favorite scenes in the documentary is the pastor from Iraq discussing the ""manna"" that appeared for soldiers during the Iraq war and, of course, the baptisms of American & European soldiers in Saddam's luxury swimming pool (Saddam hated Christians - it shows God has a sense of humor)  When you finish watching Darren Wilson documentaries you feel invincible in your faith and your conviction is so strong in emboldens you to step out in faith more and follow the examples set in the film.  This is a film that has been credited with turning scores of atheists and agnostics into born-again Christians.  Powerful.  Emotional.  Beautiful.",1400976000,,1342,4.5966386554621845

He approached modern day healing with the same skepticism that I have had and during this documentary, my skepticism retreated as his did, as I watched God do things in today's world just like He did in the days of Jesus and the early Church.

3062854,3,B00116495O,"Before you say non-believer and look for a 5-star review, I want to say that this movie is uplifting, and I am a deep believer in Christ and in miracles. The problem with this movie, is that it is trying to show that God still does miracles today, and that we have the ability to tap into that heavenly reality. I could sum it up in saying that Darren Wilson is showing ordinary people receiving extra-ordinary miracles.

While being an uplifting movie, that is where the good ends. As a documentary, I do not think Darren Wilson gives enough evidence for what he sets out to prove. There is only two miracles actually shown from before to after, and both could be explained through psychological expectation (pain going away because the brain creates endorphins in expectation of miracle). The really fantastic miracles are seen only after the healing. I believe in miracles, but why can't he even film at least one mind blowing miracle from beginning to end? He is always too late to get the actual healing on film.

He did not even try to prove the miracles he missed. In the Catholic Church they will interview family members, friends, and doctors to prove a miracle. It's not rocket science, just do a little more investigating. I would like to point out, that this type of investigation has been used since the early days of church. It is simple, say a lady is healed of blindness. Okay, then interview her friends and family. Most people will not turn down being on a movie especially if the miracle is real. As a documentary, we do not need necessarily need hardcore evidence, but we could use a little more eye-witnesses from those who knew the person who was healed.

I do not think Darren Wilson is a liar and faked the miracles. I believe he is just inexperienced. I think the lack of proof and bad shots are due to inexperience. This was his first movie, and unfortunately for him, almost every Christian who saw it loved it. Instead of improving on his style and making more in depth documentaries, he has made increasingly worse movies with even less creditable material.

I do not expect him to stop, because people are eating these semi-documentaries up. The problem is, they do nothing but uplift those who already believe. The lack of evidence makes this movie hard to show to a non-believer, and even to a believer with experience in investigation and study (scientist, theologians, bible scholars, teachers, etc.).

Good movie, but not a very in depth documentary (although the definition of documentary could be argued).",1389830400,27,2542,4.729119638826185

The bible tells us that the greatest commandment is to Love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.  Also that LOVE covers a multitude of sins.  There is so much about love in the bible but it takes a movie like this one and Furious Love to make us realize how wrong we are about so many things and how futile we are in our struggles with things that we don't need to struggle with.",1379116800,,814,4.0

For those who live out of their head you will not get offended you will get pissed off (LOL). There is so much in this film that shows just how much God is still active today. In fact, he never stopped being active except to those who believe he doesn't do these kinds of things.

I found my faith increasing while just watching the events that were filmed. Something else I heard years ago was concerning signs and wonders. Some signs are given to just make you wonder. They are plenty of things to make you wonder. I totally encourage you to but this film and allowed yourself to be challenged and expanded. This is a wonderful film. In fact, all 3 of his films are exceptional. Get them all! Not only did I wonder but I was also humbled by the God who does such things for his children. Why? Simply because he loves them.

Case in point, the homeless man on the street who gets 'his foot healed' seems like he was limping only to draw sympathy and you could confirm that in his eyes and the way his jaws locked as he stood there bearing the embarrassment of the camera flashing on him when all he wanted was some change.  I failed to notice an ounce of genuine appreciation as he walked away.  To end with that scene raises more questions regarding the validity of the miracles shown throughout the film.

Also, it's jarring for a non-believer to see people crowded together praying, crying, and quite frankly being weird.  That's just not 'normal' and it's repelling if you don't really understand why these people are acting this way.",1375833600,4,881,4.918918918918919

It's good to hear about the gold teeth and gold dust and such, as I do believe in all kinds of miracles... but the latter part of this DVD is what makes it great. For the believer, you will be charged with passion for Christ... and moved to continue acting or moving forward on His behalf.

Would I recommend this particular video to someone else for purchase? Well, if it was on sale for half-price yes I would. But at full price I'd have to say know. I've read some of the other raving reviews.... and I guess, the decision to purchase is purely based on what you like. Again, I just think too much time was spent on the gold dust/teeth part...

I would rather know how to raise the dead or heal the sick then condemn others as being bad. I'm no better then anybody else so can't do any condemning.,1369699200,,304,4.350877192982456

They were convinced and all of them invited Jesus into their hearts.  The episodes left no dimension of belief or doubt that God is dependable.  All aspects of photography and more, including sound effects and music, were beautifully done.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to friends, family, neighbors and anyone else who wants to see the reality of this current life on earth in all its glory.",1368662400,,654,4.470588235294118

The first half of this video deals with supposed ""gold teeth"" miracles and ""gold dust"" and it comes out the Toronto blessing and other things like that. Everyone needs to form their own opinion, but I think some of these ""signs and wonders"" can come from the enemy and we need to be discerning. There's a good video on youtube called ""the kundalini warning"" by Andrew Storm about these things, I recommend seeing this 30 minute video if you want to know more about this.

The latter half of this video is pretty good. Of the 3 documentaries (Furious Love, Father of Lights, Finger of God), this one is the one I liked the least. If you're interested in seeing them, I recommend the other two. I ended up purchasing both Furious Love and Father of Lights.

I tried to ask her what specifically she found convincing in the films but she never responded to that. Here is my take.

I wouldn't suggest that anyone tries to use this as evidence for miracles as miracles are assumed, not demonstrated.  Absolutely no claim in this video is investigated. Nothing is verified. The film maker explicitly takes people's word as the truth. He asks ""why would they lie?"" and leaves it at that with no attempt to consider even that question. This is the height of credulity and gullibility.

This video IS evidence of the following things among others: people have dental work, people had gem-looking things in their hands, someone had some crackers on a book, some people said they felt better for the moment. The film boldly asserts that all of these things are the work of a god, but no reason whatsoever is given to believe that.",1358985600,15,1022,4.698324022346369

Finger of God starts with some of the more weird manifestations like gold teeth, gold dust, jewels, manna...  After about the first hour or so, you start getting into more Biblically recognizable miracles of the Holy Spirit.  I call the former weird because I still don't know what to make of everything.  I personally saw the gold pouring off Sylvia Machado at Calvary Campground and I just know the place and the people and it was not some simplistic hucksterism like glitter or whatever natural explanations people might offer.  The gold teeth?  Set right next to ugly fillings?  Ay caramba!  I'm sure they are legit but boy, does that offend the mind?

Now, when you get into healing the sick, evangelism, words of knowledge and all the rest...Biblically, that's what I expect of God.  And, that's much of the film.  Even at four stars I can hardly imagine anyone not benefitting from this film.",1348185600,4,1003,4.636363636363637

3063001,4,B00116495O,"Finger of God takes an unexpected approach to God-- through the supernatural. In the modern age where people rely on science and reason to explain and justify actions, filmmaker Darren Wilson decides to see whether or not miracles still happen today by looking at the local church, the American church and all around the world-- Mozambique, China, Bulgaria-- to see how God is moving through miracles. In the footage, Wilson shows supernatural events like the deaf hearing, golden teeth growing, resurrection or gold dust appearing because Christians have prayed for them.

To be honest, the actual footage of the film is not great, though the approach was tactfully thought out. The unfortunate limited budget that Wilson had to work with ($20,000) made it hard for him to really film the miracle itself happening. Very often, he would just show things ""happen"" and not the actual process of how it happened, though I assume that skeptics will always find ways to try explain how the miracles do not occur anyways, so I'm not sure how big of a barrier the bad quality filming may have been. It's just that it can be argued strongly that a lot of the footage was staged or just a coincidence, so it really is a movie that relies on faith (though I guess the bad quality of the filming lends to credibility that the movie is probably not staged, because that would require way too much money).

If you remain a skeptic throughout the entire film, you will find only find frustration by watching this film. However, you will enjoy this movie if you have faith and open your heart and try to see past the technological imperfections of the film and see the God working behind the prayers of the people. If you sincerely believe the miracles are from God and your heart is softened, the film becomes extremely powerful in increasing a person's faith because seeing God work in a physical way is always extremely encouraging and just shows His power and might. It is encouraging to all of us to see how God is working around the world in such beautiful and dynamic ways!",1338681600,,2065,4.701657458563536

3063009,5,B00116495O,"Darren Wilson starts off this film that he made about unusual contemporary miracles by telling how his ordinary, everyday, traditionally-Christian aunt and uncle got gold teeth through prayer--but not in their traditional setting of worship where such miracles were frowned upon.  He films their and other peoples' gold teeth gotten in prayer!  He mentions the perplexing fact that people have sometimes gotten gold teeth instead of other healings that they were praying for.

Darren goes on to tell about and film manna manifesting in Bibles, and gold dust appearing upon people and preachers assembled for prayer and praise.  He shows perfectly-cut gem stones that have fallen from the sky and which jewelers say are inexplicably, too-perfectly cut,

He shows persons who feel called to demonstrate God's Love through healing prayer as they go about the streets praying for those random pedestrians whom the Holy Spirit indicates, and they achieve healing results right there--even on the campus of Yale University!  Darren talks about even LITTLE CHILDREN who are moved to pray for others' healing and who achieve results.  (And he says we need to become more like little children in our faith.)

Darren tells about hundreds of ""resurrections from the dead,"" and some places where such returns to life have become commonplace miracles.  He interviews a man who's been ""raised from the dead.""

Two of his most deeply affecting stories are about the underground churches in China and the Gypsies in Eastern Europe.  The footage of great numbers of Chinese Christians as they meet in secret safe houses and caves is very rare (or, it was said to be when this film was made in 2007).  These scenes are very moving because of the great hunger for Jesus and the gospel that the famished people demonstrate.  Their tears and cries and their reaching out for God under the visitation of the Holy Spirit are unforgettable.  I couldn't help thinking that the situation of these people in China must reflect to a great extent a picture of the earliest Christian churches where Christians with total and all-permeating faith managed to thrive under persecution in hidden places.

The moving thing about Darren's reportage on the Gypsies is that it shows how much these people who live in poverty as social outcasts have a great hunger for love and acceptance.  They responded joyously when these were given them by certain Christians who made it their mission to meet yearly with the Gypsies at a several days' long fiesta of music and love and healing prayer.

There are many other good stories in the film.

Darren's message is simply and clearly stated from the beginning, and it is that Christians are meant to demonstrate the miraculous POWER of Jesus that Jesus Himself demonstrated in His miraculous acts of Healing Mercy.  Darren states that believing Christians do have the Resurrection Power that Jesus had, and that Christians are not meant to eschew supernatural power in Christ.  And seemingly, contemporary believers and non-believers alike are eager for better evidence of God's Love than they usually perceive in the kind of traditional churches that apparently fear or for other reasons reject the practice of faith healing and experiences in the power of the Holy Spirit such as are reported in the New Testament.

The end message of the film is that demonstrating LOVE (which seems most feelingly and convincedly received when people experience miracles, especially of HEALING) is the one, single, most important Christian calling.  And the film makes a very good case for that message.  It can be a life-changing film for believers and non-believers alike who are open-minded and open-hearted enough to receive its message.  It conveys very plausibly, but with a nice, light, relaxed touch, which seems characteristic of Darren's personality, the fact that God DOES work unusual miracles through faith.  Darren says the reason Jesus gives these miracles is because He wishes to show all people how very much He loves them.

(The only very small complaint that I  would express is about a technical aspect of the film.  I felt it moved a bit slowly and sometimes dwelt too repetitiously on the same film footage, but that wasn't really much of a problem.)",1322352000,3,4265,5.054285714285714

3063016,5,B00116495O,"As most people will rate this movie based on their strong opinions on whether they agree or disagree with the content, I'd like to take a different approach.  I thought Finger Of God was incredible for multiple reasons.

First off, with a budget of $20,000, Darren Wilson does a fantastic job producing this film.  I have seen more documentaries that I care to admit that couldn't match Darren's production value with a higher budget.  Second, Darren does a tremendous job of documenting in a clear and honest way with no smoke and mirrors and no 'slick talk' like you see in other documentaries.  The content in this piece is so sensitive and Mr. Wilson did a great job presenting it without making the watcher feel uncomfortable.

I consider myself a charasmatic skeptic so most of the film resonated with me.  However there were a few parts where I wanted to believe what was going on (gems from heaven) but wanted more proof.  But after much consideration, I don't believe that giving proof was any kind of theme in this movie, nor did it need to be.  A documentary can 'document' without having to go into argumentative detail on its findings.  And with much of the content in this movie, there will always be a burden of proof.  If Mr. Wilson would have put a gemologist in his film to prove the gems were in fact real, it still wouldn't have appeased the skeptics and it would have helped the timbre of the film at all.

Even though I'm still a tad skeptical on a few of its topics (I just can't get my head around the gems) it doesn't mean in any way its a bad movie.  People that never study things they disagree with lead very boring lives.  But the things that I agreed with, resonated with me so much that I fell in love with this movie.  The first time I heard the concept of the treasure hunt was by watching this movie.  This concept was challenged and inspired me.  The footage of the underground church in China was life changing.

I would encourage any Christian to watch this film.  Even if you don't agree with everything, you'll find something in it that will spark your love for God.  And even if that doesn't happen, well then at least you've educated yourself on a different culture. It's a win-win.",1272758400,24,2223,4.496259351620948

  I most likely would have been a sceptic had I not recieved a gold tooth myself a church meeting in Maui. The tooth that turned to gold was black inside and was very painful prior to the event. The visiting speaker was David Herzog, he said he saw gold teeth (among other things people needed healing for floating in the room), and declared if we would get up and walk around the room that we would receive from the Lord. So I walked around. Then he said to ask seven people to look in our mouths to see if we had gold teeth, so I asked - the first six people said I had nothing, then the seventh said ""You got one in the back of your mouth"". I was so surprised I ran to my wife to have her look, she was blown away. We've been married 25 years and I've never had gold in my mouth. I had it xrayed later by a dentist, the tooth not only was covered in gold, but the xray showed it had a root canal done to it.
  At least four or five other people recieved gold teeth also the same night. One couple in their seventies later admitted they had come from Oahu to spy on what was going on so they could report back that it was all fake, they both got gold teeth, and the lady got at least four herself while others watched the teeth actually change while she held her mouth open ( laughing the whole time ).
  God is good!

3063020,3,B00116495O,"The problem is that the narrarator, Darren Wilson, is very much a fundamentalist Christian himself. Even though he says things towards the beginning like ""I'm struggling with this too"" it quickly becomes very obvious that he is *not* struggling with any of this (he believes it 100%) and he's also not willing to entertain the possibility that any of these miracles are *not* true.

The result is that nothing is verified in the film. We don't see any of the miracles actually happening. Ironically, on their own website Wilson has a question in his FAQ that says: why aren't any of the miracles verified? Wilson's answer is that you can't prove anything to a skeptic anyway.

What a shame. If these miracles are true (and maybe they are) then let's present the evidence truthfully and completely so that folks can see God.  Instead of showing countless miracles behind a fuzzy lense, just show us ONE miracle and all the needed evidence -- camera angles, pre evidence, post-evidence etc. so that the viewer can see the whole truth.",1261267200,19,1032,4.8192090395480225
3063021,4,B00116495O,"The Finger of God was a wake-up presentation for me.  I have been a lifelong Christian and even had a 'Shekhinah' experience with the Holy Spirit back in 1985.  It was a wake up call for me because I came away from the documentary thinking that God doesn't change and the power that was wielded by the early Christians to heal, cast out demons, change lives and plug into the limitless power of God is still here.  I came away thinking one clear statement.  I came away from it saying to myself; 'We're not doing what we should be doing and what we can be doing'.

There are some parts of the DVD that I find just too weird to be true however, like people in church supposedly spontaneously receiving gold crowns on their teeth from out of the wild blue yonder.  But coming from my perspective of having actually had a shekhinah experience with God myself, the things that God is doing around the world, both outside of the United States as well as inside, are eye-opening.  The director of the documentary Darren Wilson did an interview online about the documentary itself that is a must watch if you buy it.

3063024,2,B00116495O,"I watched Finger Of God with my weekly Bible Study.  I found it interesting, but the problem arises when you stop yourself and think what proof does he give.  You see, for a long time people have fallen to tricks and deception of false teachers.  One only has to do a little searching on google to find information of false faith healers and such.  What the person who made this video should have done was show some proof.  No, I'm not asking God to work in my box of understanding, but the video should have done more to show some form of proof.  People who accept outlandish events with not trying to understand if this is really from God or not, set themselves up to accept lies and deception.  Many known false teacher have done acts that look like a miracles only to deceive many who don't question.  This video in and of it's self doesn't project any one false teachers, but sets up the viewer to want to see miracles in their life and fellowship.  Though I do believe in miracles, the ones presented in the beginning of this video show no point for them.  Why give a person a gold tooth, or gold dust?  Nowhere in the the Bible is such an event, and there is no real reason for the event to happen.  What it does do is set the viewer up to want these event in their life with no proof that these events are actually from God.  As the video continues it does get better. As a chance to view other groups of Christians around the world who have nothing and rely on God for healing and to meet their needs.  I found this later part to be the best part of the video. Very touching to say the least.  Anyhow,  If you buy or watch this view, ask yourself through out the video, is this the type of events we see in the bible?

Basicaly throughout this whole dvd the commentator just asserts that a miracle has just happened without giving any evidence.  For example:

He asserts that people find magic gems that scientists can't even classify because ""they are too perfect.""  It would have been impressive if they actualy showed the respected gemologist who made these findings...  but I guess he was camera shy.

He asserts that everytime this one guy comes to church mannah magicaly appears in his bible and he shows the stuff in his bible.  It would have been nice if he would have actualy videod the bible, shown it was empty, and then, without anyone tampering with it, shown the stuff appear in it.  Instead we are just to take his word that that's what happened.  I mean he claims this video took years and hundreds of hours of film so why couldn't he have took the time to prove this?

He asserts that a woman had a baseball sized tumor in the back of her neck and now it's healed.  This all happened ""just minutes before I arrived with my camcorder.""  How convenient.

If you've seen the video then you know I could go on and on but you get the point.

From the beginning you feel the sense that it is something different, the guy doing the video, as well as speaking seems very real in his own quest to find the truth. This is revealed in the general amateur format of the dvd. It really is just a 'person, seeking the truth fired by his own experiences.'

As it is stated at some point of the DVD, what is the real benefit of lying about these things? As for me, it is genuine as you will get. Believing what you see is another thing, that will require faith.

My personal experience with it was one that got me depressed. When the reality hits, that we live far beneath our means, even in our perceptions of who God really is. We confess so much, but what we expect and actually believe is so far from what we profess.

All in all, for me I have realized the lack of faith on my part to really see who God is, and as such through this DVD I have made it an everyday goal to challenge my own faith. I use to think I was bold about the gospel of Jesus, until I saw this dvd, the message of miracles is only superseded by the message of love.

You may want to follow it up with watching his interview with Sid Roth by googling Sid's site, ""It's Supernatural"". Darren didn't want to make this film, but he was called to do it. He had never made a film and was pursued by God until it was completed. You simply will never see anything else like it. His style is fresh, honest and sincere. He is a transparent, funny, talented storyteller and the content of God's working miracles everyday, everywhere is nothing short of amazing. Please buy or rent this film, gather two or more if you can, throw a seeker party and enjoy God. In my opinion the strongest witness in this film is the disclosure of why would anybody lie about miracles like these that happen to them? And over and over, when they have nothing to gain? Darren, congratulations and please, when God calls you to make another film, don't run so long, just get to it. You know you are going to anyway!

3063046,4,B00116495O,"I thought Finger of God was a very well done and powerful movie.  Now I admit that I'm a member of the choir, so I had no problem with belief in the miraculous before I even popped the DVD into the machine, so naturally there was going to be a lot here that moved me.  I did, however, want to make a few points about some of the material.

The film includes a story of a Buddhist monk whom we are told was dead for several days, and was miraculously revived after what most would think of as far too long a period of time for such a thing to be possible.  Upon returning to the realm of the living, the first he says to his fellow monks is, ""I saw the Buddha burning...we must listen to the Christians.""  This is the problem I've been struggling with for years.  The historical Buddha lived 500 years before the birth of Jesus.  Why would he be punished with eternal hellfire because he was born too early in history, and in a place on the planet to have ever had the opportunity to hear about the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, never mind anything about his only begotten Son, Jesus?  Is that to say that every soul born before the birth of Christ is burning as well?  I can not believe this to be the case.  I have studied Buddhism and find it very compatible with the teaching of Jesus...nearly parallel.  I'm by no means a Buddhist, but this message is very troublesome.  Does this mean that every aborigine that lived in the Australian outback 3,000 years ago is frying in hell?  Weren't they also made in the image of God?  The Buddha wanted to eradicate suffering from the world...this is a bad thing?

Anyway, there was much of the DVD that I would love to say my Amens and Hallelujahs to without question, but there were no actual miracles caught live as they happened.  I'm not saying that means miracles didn't happen...but I'm not ready to jump in with both feet and believe the whole precious gems, manna and gold teeth thing mindlessly.  I'm reminded of that line about keeping an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.  Sure that homeless man could have been healed as the camera was rolling, or it could have been a well rehearsed act.  Sure, those people could have had gold teeth appear miraculously in their mouths, or they could have been there for years.  Too much of what the Darren Wilson tells us we have to take on faith (no pun intended).  I don't think he was lying or making it up, mostly because I can't imagine what his motivation would be to do so.  I believe Wilson was making a sincere effort here and much of Finger of God is extremely powerful, especially the parts filmed in Africa and China.  More than anything else, this film reminded me that light pierces even the deepest darkness, and evil can not persist as long as love exists in the world.",1211500800,7,2801,4.354527938342967
3063047,5,B00116495O,"Watching this video is like reading the book of Acts in the New Testament, but instead of a group of Jews 2000 years ago, there are people from all over the world experiencing the power of God today.  I don't give it 5 stars for the quality of the presentation, but for the information that is compiled.  It is truly amazing to hear accounts from all over the world about the works of the Lord.

The author travels from California to Africa to Eastern Europe to interview and minister with preachers who are seeing masses come to Christ through the miraculous works of the Holy Spirit.

His interviews include Bill Johnson, Jason Westerfield, Christ Overstreet, George Banov, Heidi and Rolland Baker, Sid Roth, and a host of others.

The stories in the video are so amazing, that they are hard to believe, but he does stress that no one has any reason to make them up.

It is not a movie about religion, far from it- instead its a movie about God, and sharing God's love, not his rules.  If you have yet to experience the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, this will  movie will rock your mind and touch your heart.",1210118400,4,1119,4.477832512315271

""Finger of God"" will challenge all of your preconceived notions about whether or not the Creator still cares/sees/acts/lives today.  The film immediately thrusts you to the edge of your comfort zone, pushes you past the walls of your ""god-box"", and brings you face to face with the truth about what you are truly willing to believe.  The film maker forces you to look at YOUR heart, at YOUR faith, and asks YOU the hard questions:  ""Could God still raise a man from the dead?  Does He still do miracles like that today?  Would He?  What do you REALLY believe?  Why?""

It seems to be intended for an audience that isn't so sure if miracles still occur, but delivered in a way that is only useful to those Christians who are already familiar with faith healing and Pentecostal manifestations, Bethel Church, JHOP and the like. For your Methodists, Presbyterians, theology heavy minded folks, not so much.

Second I do not like how it is implied that if we are not out seeking to heal the physically sick then we aren't a ""good"" Christian. Some people are not called to serve others in this way. Paul clearly states this in 1 Corinthians chapter 12.

Third, being a Christian is not about ""what miracle can I get from God?"" Being a Christian is about having faith in the fact that Jesus died for our sins and then was raised again on the third day.

I do believe that there are miracles and that God blesses, however, these blessings are not always instantaneous. I had a very serious infection and I was blessed in the fact that I had gotten to the doctor before it had gotten any worse and that it healed quite quickly, I was blessed in the fact that I had a skilled doctor taking care of me. However at the same time I am still waiting on another blessing. Also sometimes God will say no to us. God is not someone that we just get handouts from.

I was a movie buff for a while but had never heard of this film.  Also, I particularly love movies based on true stories as well as real documentaries.  I have mixed feelings about this movie that I'll succinctly put this way.  1. If you are a ""mature"" Christian in that you have a deep and well rounded objective understanding of real life and scripture, you should be able to discern for yourself whatever you want to take away from this.  There are wonderful and beautiful nuggets of miracles, selflessness, obedience, sacrifice, and true faith.  However, I personally found some aspects of this film very disturbing.  2. If you are a new and young Christian, it is quite possible you could be grossly turned off or completely misled.  I fear this might be the case for many who view and that saddens me.  3. If you are agnostic, have atheistic tendencies, or are from a completely other religion, I wonder what you think.  Finally, all I can say is this.  I'm no expert and everyone will have an opinion.  I'll just say that I believe much of this film misrepresents TRUE Christian faith.  The confusing part is that much of the film is a great representation of good solid Christian teachings as well.  Christ came to love not to condemn.  He came to forgive sins and to show his people love.  His miracles consisted of healing, befriending the unfriend-worthy, the wretched, the wicked.  He shared, gave, sacrificed and humbled himself.  He did not flash jewels, flaunt strength to the weak, oppress, give gold dust or money.

3297138,1,B00116495O,"Let me say from the outset that I am not a Christian but I believe in God just do not believe that you have accept Jusus Christ as your savior to witness a miracle. I am constantly in a state of prayer and surrender as well and have experienced my own form of miracles and very clear guidance from God.
I had to stop watching the movie about three quarters of the way into it because I really could not take the implication that the God that was being referred to here was only the Lord, God, Jesus - really?  Do not think that the mind that conceived the Sermon On the Mount would applaud your denigration of all other religions by implication.
Do you really believe that Christ would cause farmers who were not Christian to lose their crop? What kind of love is that.???
To see a movie like this in a day and age when the biggest calling we have is to respect and love one another is actually quite disturbing.
Quite sure that if you would research other religions and seek out miracles in those you will find the same thing.
The bottom line is to learn to live and walk and act as an act of worship and appreciation and yes- expectation that you are loved and will experience the miracle of divine guidance.

3297225,1,B00116495O,"This film is about people having massive religious experiences in Jesus's precious name. A religious experience, or being healed, doesn't mean you automatically have salvation.  It's supposed to point to the Savior, and even then, there must be belief and repentance. I""m guessing for many in this vein of Christianity, salvation or doctrine is vast and empty and not very important.

I hope all those people in the film truly are/were healed. But do they have saving faith in Jesus Christ for the repentance of sins? In the end, who knows? True faith in Jesus Christ does not need a sign or a wonder, for it rests solely on the finished work of the cross. I wonder how addicted are people to signs and wonders? If something exciting didn't happen, would it be less of a worship? Have signs and wonders become an idol in exchange for simple, reasonable faith? From this film, I got the impression that traditional, orthodox, daily faith in the forgiveness of sins is not good enough. Let me tell you about a miracle that outshines any on this film. The transformation of a sinful, hell-bent soul on a war path to perishing, turn 180 degrees around and completely sanctified at the end of their life by the indwelling Holy Spirit due to simple, daily belief in Jesus Christ crucified, risen, and coming again. That's the only miracle you need! And it happens to every believer, whether or not anyone notices.

Finger of God is perfect for our experience driven, emotional high-addicted culture.  And, look, we are planting more of these churches overseas. Did you see Heidi Baker talking to the pastor in Turkey, just after they prayed for Muslim woman? Heidi just wanted to ""love"" this woman by praying for her. OK, that's fine, That's nice. But, the pastor wanted to create a disciple, it seemed. Isn't that what he's supposed to do? But, then he goes and gets lectured by Heidi that he is not loving enough.

The Bible predicts a MASSIVE falling away of the church in the end times, and signs, hearings, and wonders will play a heavy role in it, confusing many. How does this happen? People stop questioning, and stop studying the Word and stop examining their hearts before God, falling away from biblical truth, and start having religious experiences. It's clothed in attractiveness! I am NOT saying that the people displayed in this film - the hungry crowds, or the people healed or raised from the dead - are not truly christians. I am not saying that. What I AM saying is that this film is promoting a type of religion that, swallowed whole, can deceive massive amounts of followers and lead people away from the cross and salvation.

In this film,  I saw a lot of subjective anecdotal experiences. I saw a lot of people avidly praying, pridefully commanding God down to do their will, without the gospel being spoken or communicated thoughtfully. I saw a lot of people who were being ""healed"" looking confused and maybe even awkwardly distressed, careful not to be rude.  I heard a lot about how the gospel is all about a wide, unoffensive, generic, culturally defined ""love"", but not the sort of love that died on the cross, and asks us to do the same. It's just never mentioned. Maybe that was an oversight. Or, maybe it's assumed. Sorry, but I feel like this movie was really terrible.",1409702400,15,3296,4.710069444444445

3297298,5,B00116495O,"I happened to catch this playing late one night on TBN.  It was such a powerful film that I ended up purchasing the basic (non deluxe) edition and sharing it with my family and friends (and everyone was in awe of the film).  Then, as usual, I gave it as a gift to someone and decided to repurchase another copy for myself.  That is when I stumbled across the Special Edition version and I knew I had to have it.  So much bonus footage that was cut due to time in the original is available in this package and was well worth paying extra for.  More documented faith healings, more heart touching scenes, and even documented cases live of people being raised from the dead by the power of Jesus.  One of my favorite scenes in the documentary is the pastor from Iraq discussing the ""manna"" that appeared for soldiers during the Iraq war and, of course, the baptisms of American & European soldiers in Saddam's luxury swimming pool (Saddam hated Christians - it shows God has a sense of humor)  When you finish watching Darren Wilson documentaries you feel invincible in your faith and your conviction is so strong in emboldens you to step out in faith more and follow the examples set in the film.  This is a film that has been credited with turning scores of atheists and agnostics into born-again Christians.  Powerful.  Emotional.  Beautiful.",1400976000,,1342,4.5966386554621845

3297351,3,B00116495O,"Before you say non-believer and look for a 5-star review, I want to say that this movie is uplifting, and I am a deep believer in Christ and in miracles. The problem with this movie, is that it is trying to show that God still does miracles today, and that we have the ability to tap into that heavenly reality. I could sum it up in saying that Darren Wilson is showing ordinary people receiving extra-ordinary miracles.

While being an uplifting movie, that is where the good ends. As a documentary, I do not think Darren Wilson gives enough evidence for what he sets out to prove. There is only two miracles actually shown from before to after, and both could be explained through psychological expectation (pain going away because the brain creates endorphins in expectation of miracle). The really fantastic miracles are seen only after the healing. I believe in miracles, but why can't he even film at least one mind blowing miracle from beginning to end? He is always too late to get the actual healing on film.

He did not even try to prove the miracles he missed. In the Catholic Church they will interview family members, friends, and doctors to prove a miracle. It's not rocket science, just do a little more investigating. I would like to point out, that this type of investigation has been used since the early days of church. It is simple, say a lady is healed of blindness. Okay, then interview her friends and family. Most people will not turn down being on a movie especially if the miracle is real. As a documentary, we do not need necessarily need hardcore evidence, but we could use a little more eye-witnesses from those who knew the person who was healed.

I do not think Darren Wilson is a liar and faked the miracles. I believe he is just inexperienced. I think the lack of proof and bad shots are due to inexperience. This was his first movie, and unfortunately for him, almost every Christian who saw it loved it. Instead of improving on his style and making more in depth documentaries, he has made increasingly worse movies with even less creditable material.

I do not expect him to stop, because people are eating these semi-documentaries up. The problem is, they do nothing but uplift those who already believe. The lack of evidence makes this movie hard to show to a non-believer, and even to a believer with experience in investigation and study (scientist, theologians, bible scholars, teachers, etc.).

Good movie, but not a very in depth documentary (although the definition of documentary could be argued).",1389830400,27,2542,4.729119638826185

I just ordered Father of Lights and can't wait to get not just another spiritual high and hunger after the heart of our Daddy!!!  I want to be used by Him like the folks in the video!!

3297426,5,B00116495O,"I remember hearing years ago that God will offend the mind to reveal the heart. The test to how religious you are is how offended you will get while watching this movie. For those who live out of their head you will not get offended you will get pissed off (LOL). There is so much in this film that shows just how much God is still active today. In fact, he never stopped being active except to those who believe he doesn't do these kinds of things.

I found my faith increasing while just watching the events that were filmed. Something else I heard years ago was concerning signs and wonders. Some signs are given to just make you wonder. They are plenty of things to make you wonder. I totally encourage you to but this film and allowed yourself to be challenged and expanded. This is a wonderful film. In fact, all 3 of his films are exceptional. Get them all! Not only did I wonder but I was also humbled by the God who does such things for his children. Why? Simply because he loves them. If that offends then you better deal with it because that is just what he is like. When you are done watching seriously think about showing them to others.",1376265600,,1150,4.299539170506913
3297427,2,B00116495O,"This movie glosses over miracles like a bad textbook.  It raises more skepticism regarding divinely inspired events than providing compelling and undeniable evidence.  Case in point, the homeless man on the street who gets 'his foot healed' seems like he was limping only to draw sympathy and you could confirm that in his eyes and the way his jaws locked as he stood there bearing the embarrassment of the camera flashing on him when all he wanted was some change.  I failed to notice an ounce of genuine appreciation as he walked away.  To end with that scene raises more questions regarding the validity of the miracles shown throughout the film.

Also, it's jarring for a non-believer to see people crowded together praying, crying, and quite frankly being weird.  That's just not 'normal' and it's repelling if you don't really understand why these people are acting this way.",1375833600,4,881,4.918918918918919

It's good to hear about the gold teeth and gold dust and such, as I do believe in all kinds of miracles... but the latter part of this DVD is what makes it great. For the believer, you will be charged with passion for Christ... and moved to continue acting or moving forward on His behalf.

Would I recommend this particular video to someone else for purchase? Well, if it was on sale for half-price yes I would. But at full price I'd have to say know. I've read some of the other raving reviews.... and I guess, the decision to purchase is purely based on what you like. Again, I just think too much time was spent on the gold dust/teeth part...

From a former athiest perspective to a born again believer, I was skeptical to these videos. But I kept asking why and watching.

3297438,5,B00116495O,It makes you think. Why does the Bible say Christians should be doing miracles as a regular thing? Why isn't this taught in Bible schools and churches?

They were convinced and all of them invited Jesus into their hearts.  The episodes left no dimension of belief or doubt that God is dependable.

3297444,2,B00116495O,"I didn't like the first half of this documentary. I'm not skeptical about God's miracles - clearly we know they happened in scriptures and I have seen them happen today too. The first half of this video deals with supposed ""gold teeth"" miracles and ""gold dust"" and it comes out the Toronto blessing and other things like that. Everyone needs to form their own opinion, but I think some of these ""signs and wonders"" can come from the enemy and we need to be discerning. There's a good video on youtube called ""the kundalini warning"" by Andrew Storm about these things, I recommend seeing this 30 minute video if you want to know more about this.

The latter half of this video is pretty good. Of the 3 documentaries (Furious Love, Father of Lights, Finger of God), this one is the one I liked the least. If you're interested in seeing them, I recommend the other two. I ended up purchasing both Furious Love and Father of Lights.

However, what he documents is not the ""Finger of God"" but rather the lack of evidence offered by those who claim to invoke miracles in the name of Jesus.

I tried to ask her what specifically she found convincing in the films but she never responded to that. Here is my take.

I wouldn't suggest that anyone tries to use this as evidence for miracles as miracles are assumed, not demonstrated.  Absolutely no claim in this video is investigated. Nothing is verified. The film maker explicitly takes people's word as the truth. He asks ""why would they lie?"" and leaves it at that with no attempt to consider even that question. This is the height of credulity and gullibility.

This video IS evidence of the following things among others: people have dental work, people had gem-looking things in their hands, someone had some crackers on a book, some people said they felt better for the moment. The film boldly asserts that all of these things are the work of a god, but no reason whatsoever is given to believe that.",1358985600,15,1022,4.698324022346369

Finger of God starts with some of the more weird manifestations like gold teeth, gold dust, jewels, manna...  After about the first hour or so, you start getting into more Biblically recognizable miracles of the Holy Spirit.  I call the former weird because I still don't know what to make of everything.  I personally saw the gold pouring off Sylvia Machado at Calvary Campground and I just know the place and the people and it was not some simplistic hucksterism like glitter or whatever natural explanations people might offer.  The gold teeth?  Set right next to ugly fillings?  Ay caramba!  I'm sure they are legit but boy, does that offend the mind?

3297498,4,B00116495O,"Finger of God takes an unexpected approach to God-- through the supernatural. In the modern age where people rely on science and reason to explain and justify actions, filmmaker Darren Wilson decides to see whether or not miracles still happen today by looking at the local church, the American church and all around the world-- Mozambique, China, Bulgaria-- to see how God is moving through miracles. In the footage, Wilson shows supernatural events like the deaf hearing, golden teeth growing, resurrection or gold dust appearing because Christians have prayed for them.

To be honest, the actual footage of the film is not great, though the approach was tactfully thought out. The unfortunate limited budget that Wilson had to work with ($20,000) made it hard for him to really film the miracle itself happening. Very often, he would just show things ""happen"" and not the actual process of how it happened, though I assume that skeptics will always find ways to try explain how the miracles do not occur anyways, so I'm not sure how big of a barrier the bad quality filming may have been. It's just that it can be argued strongly that a lot of the footage was staged or just a coincidence, so it really is a movie that relies on faith (though I guess the bad quality of the filming lends to credibility that the movie is probably not staged, because that would require way too much money).

If you remain a skeptic throughout the entire film, you will find only find frustration by watching this film. However, you will enjoy this movie if you have faith and open your heart and try to see past the technological imperfections of the film and see the God working behind the prayers of the people. If you sincerely believe the miracles are from God and your heart is softened, the film becomes extremely powerful in increasing a person's faith because seeing God work in a physical way is always extremely encouraging and just shows His power and might. It is encouraging to all of us to see how God is working around the world in such beautiful and dynamic ways!",1338681600,,2065,4.701657458563536

3297506,5,B00116495O,"Darren Wilson starts off this film that he made about unusual contemporary miracles by telling how his ordinary, everyday, traditionally-Christian aunt and uncle got gold teeth through prayer--but not in their traditional setting of worship where such miracles were frowned upon.  He films their and other peoples' gold teeth gotten in prayer!  He mentions the perplexing fact that people have sometimes gotten gold teeth instead of other healings that they were praying for.

Darren goes on to tell about and film manna manifesting in Bibles, and gold dust appearing upon people and preachers assembled for prayer and praise.  He shows perfectly-cut gem stones that have fallen from the sky and which jewelers say are inexplicably, too-perfectly cut,

He shows persons who feel called to demonstrate God's Love through healing prayer as they go about the streets praying for those random pedestrians whom the Holy Spirit indicates, and they achieve healing results right there--even on the campus of Yale University!  Darren talks about even LITTLE CHILDREN who are moved to pray for others' healing and who achieve results.  (And he says we need to become more like little children in our faith.)

Darren tells about hundreds of ""resurrections from the dead,"" and some places where such returns to life have become commonplace miracles.  He interviews a man who's been ""raised from the dead.""

Two of his most deeply affecting stories are about the underground churches in China and the Gypsies in Eastern Europe.  The footage of great numbers of Chinese Christians as they meet in secret safe houses and caves is very rare (or, it was said to be when this film was made in 2007).  These scenes are very moving because of the great hunger for Jesus and the gospel that the famished people demonstrate.  Their tears and cries and their reaching out for God under the visitation of the Holy Spirit are unforgettable.  I couldn't help thinking that the situation of these people in China must reflect to a great extent a picture of the earliest Christian churches where Christians with total and all-permeating faith managed to thrive under persecution in hidden places.

The moving thing about Darren's reportage on the Gypsies is that it shows how much these people who live in poverty as social outcasts have a great hunger for love and acceptance.  They responded joyously when these were given them by certain Christians who made it their mission to meet yearly with the Gypsies at a several days' long fiesta of music and love and healing prayer.

There are many other good stories in the film.

Darren's message is simply and clearly stated from the beginning, and it is that Christians are meant to demonstrate the miraculous POWER of Jesus that Jesus Himself demonstrated in His miraculous acts of Healing Mercy.  Darren states that believing Christians do have the Resurrection Power that Jesus had, and that Christians are not meant to eschew supernatural power in Christ.  And seemingly, contemporary believers and non-believers alike are eager for better evidence of God's Love than they usually perceive in the kind of traditional churches that apparently fear or for other reasons reject the practice of faith healing and experiences in the power of the Holy Spirit such as are reported in the New Testament.

The end message of the film is that demonstrating LOVE (which seems most feelingly and convincedly received when people experience miracles, especially of HEALING) is the one, single, most important Christian calling.  And the film makes a very good case for that message.  It can be a life-changing film for believers and non-believers alike who are open-minded and open-hearted enough to receive its message.  It conveys very plausibly, but with a nice, light, relaxed touch, which seems characteristic of Darren's personality, the fact that God DOES work unusual miracles through faith.  Darren says the reason Jesus gives these miracles is because He wishes to show all people how very much He loves them.

(The only very small complaint that I  would express is about a technical aspect of the film.  I felt it moved a bit slowly and sometimes dwelt too repetitiously on the same film footage, but that wasn't really much of a problem.)",1322352000,3,4265,5.054285714285714

3297513,5,B00116495O,"As most people will rate this movie based on their strong opinions on whether they agree or disagree with the content, I'd like to take a different approach.  I thought Finger Of God was incredible for multiple reasons.

First off, with a budget of $20,000, Darren Wilson does a fantastic job producing this film.  I have seen more documentaries that I care to admit that couldn't match Darren's production value with a higher budget.  Second, Darren does a tremendous job of documenting in a clear and honest way with no smoke and mirrors and no 'slick talk' like you see in other documentaries.  The content in this piece is so sensitive and Mr. Wilson did a great job presenting it without making the watcher feel uncomfortable.

I consider myself a charasmatic skeptic so most of the film resonated with me.  However there were a few parts where I wanted to believe what was going on (gems from heaven) but wanted more proof.  But after much consideration, I don't believe that giving proof was any kind of theme in this movie, nor did it need to be.  A documentary can 'document' without having to go into argumentative detail on its findings.  And with much of the content in this movie, there will always be a burden of proof.  If Mr. Wilson would have put a gemologist in his film to prove the gems were in fact real, it still wouldn't have appeased the skeptics and it would have helped the timbre of the film at all.

Even though I'm still a tad skeptical on a few of its topics (I just can't get my head around the gems) it doesn't mean in any way its a bad movie.  People that never study things they disagree with lead very boring lives.  But the things that I agreed with, resonated with me so much that I fell in love with this movie.  The first time I heard the concept of the treasure hunt was by watching this movie.  This concept was challenged and inspired me.  The footage of the underground church in China was life changing.

I would encourage any Christian to watch this film.  Even if you don't agree with everything, you'll find something in it that will spark your love for God.  And even if that doesn't happen, well then at least you've educated yourself on a different culture. It's a win-win.",1272758400,24,2223,4.496259351620948

  I most likely would have been a sceptic had I not recieved a gold tooth myself a church meeting in Maui. The tooth that turned to gold was black inside and was very painful prior to the event. The visiting speaker was David Herzog, he said he saw gold teeth (among other things people needed healing for floating in the room), and declared if we would get up and walk around the room that we would receive from the Lord. So I walked around. Then he said to ask seven people to look in our mouths to see if we had gold teeth, so I asked - the first six people said I had nothing, then the seventh said ""You got one in the back of your mouth"". I was so surprised I ran to my wife to have her look, she was blown away. We've been married 25 years and I've never had gold in my mouth. I had it xrayed later by a dentist, the tooth not only was covered in gold, but the xray showed it had a root canal done to it.
  At least four or five other people recieved gold teeth also the same night. One couple in their seventies later admitted they had come from Oahu to spy on what was going on so they could report back that it was all fake, they both got gold teeth, and the lady got at least four herself while others watched the teeth actually change while she held her mouth open ( laughing the whole time ).
  God is good!
You can see my tooth photo on my blog: [...]

3297517,3,B00116495O,"The problem is that the narrarator, Darren Wilson, is very much a fundamentalist Christian himself. Even though he says things towards the beginning like ""I'm struggling with this too"" it quickly becomes very obvious that he is *not* struggling with any of this (he believes it 100%) and he's also not willing to entertain the possibility that any of these miracles are *not* true.

The result is that nothing is verified in the film. We don't see any of the miracles actually happening. Ironically, on their own website Wilson has a question in his FAQ that says: why aren't any of the miracles verified? Wilson's answer is that you can't prove anything to a skeptic anyway.

What a shame. If these miracles are true (and maybe they are) then let's present the evidence truthfully and completely so that folks can see God.  Instead of showing countless miracles behind a fuzzy lense, just show us ONE miracle and all the needed evidence -- camera angles, pre evidence, post-evidence etc. so that the viewer can see the whole truth.",1261267200,19,1032,4.8192090395480225
3297518,4,B00116495O,"The Finger of God was a wake-up presentation for me.  I have been a lifelong Christian and even had a 'Shekhinah' experience with the Holy Spirit back in 1985.  It was a wake up call for me because I came away from the documentary thinking that God doesn't change and the power that was wielded by the early Christians to heal, cast out demons, change lives and plug into the limitless power of God is still here.  I came away thinking one clear statement.  I came away from it saying to myself; 'We're not doing what we should be doing and what we can be doing'.

There are some parts of the DVD that I find just too weird to be true however, like people in church supposedly spontaneously receiving gold crowns on their teeth from out of the wild blue yonder.  But coming from my perspective of having actually had a shekhinah experience with God myself, the things that God is doing around the world, both outside of the United States as well as inside, are eye-opening.  The director of the documentary Darren Wilson did an interview online about the documentary itself that is a must watch if you buy it.

3297521,2,B00116495O,"I watched Finger Of God with my weekly Bible Study.  I found it interesting, but the problem arises when you stop yourself and think what proof does he give.  You see, for a long time people have fallen to tricks and deception of false teachers.  One only has to do a little searching on google to find information of false faith healers and such.  What the person who made this video should have done was show some proof.  No, I'm not asking God to work in my box of understanding, but the video should have done more to show some form of proof.  People who accept outlandish events with not trying to understand if this is really from God or not, set themselves up to accept lies and deception.  Many known false teacher have done acts that look like a miracles only to deceive many who don't question.  This video in and of it's self doesn't project any one false teachers, but sets up the viewer to want to see miracles in their life and fellowship.  Though I do believe in miracles, the ones presented in the beginning of this video show no point for them.  Why give a person a gold tooth, or gold dust?  Nowhere in the the Bible is such an event, and there is no real reason for the event to happen.  What it does do is set the viewer up to want these event in their life with no proof that these events are actually from God.  As the video continues it does get better. As a chance to view other groups of Christians around the world who have nothing and rely on God for healing and to meet their needs.  I found this later part to be the best part of the video. Very touching to say the least.  Anyhow,  If you buy or watch this view, ask yourself through out the video, is this the type of events we see in the bible?

Basicaly throughout this whole dvd the commentator just asserts that a miracle has just happened without giving any evidence.  For example:

He asserts that people find magic gems that scientists can't even classify because ""they are too perfect.""  It would have been impressive if they actualy showed the respected gemologist who made these findings...  but I guess he was camera shy.

He asserts that everytime this one guy comes to church mannah magicaly appears in his bible and he shows the stuff in his bible.  It would have been nice if he would have actualy videod the bible, shown it was empty, and then, without anyone tampering with it, shown the stuff appear in it.  Instead we are just to take his word that that's what happened.  I mean he claims this video took years and hundreds of hours of film so why couldn't he have took the time to prove this?

He asserts that a woman had a baseball sized tumor in the back of her neck and now it's healed.  This all happened ""just minutes before I arrived with my camcorder.""  How convenient.

If you've seen the video then you know I could go on and on but you get the point.

This DVD gave me the encouragement I needed to take my walk with God to another level; it challenged me to truly do what I was called to do and not be a passive believer but step  out and be used by God to glorify Him by allowing His love to shine through me. My passion to ""do"" the work has been re-ignited! I am grateful that it is not too late and that I am alive for Him to finish the work He started in me! :-)",1235865600,2,499,3.798076923076923

3297535,5,B00116495O,"First off, the main point before anyone wants to purchase something like this is, 'is this another movie thing?' From the beginning you feel the sense that it is something different, the guy doing the video, as well as speaking seems very real in his own quest to find the truth. This is revealed in the general amateur format of the dvd. It really is just a 'person, seeking the truth fired by his own experiences.'

As it is stated at some point of the DVD, what is the real benefit of lying about these things? As for me, it is genuine as you will get. Believing what you see is another thing, that will require faith.

My personal experience with it was one that got me depressed. When the reality hits, that we live far beneath our means, even in our perceptions of who God really is. We confess so much, but what we expect and actually believe is so far from what we profess.

All in all, for me I have realized the lack of faith on my part to really see who God is, and as such through this DVD I have made it an everyday goal to challenge my own faith. I use to think I was bold about the gospel of Jesus, until I saw this dvd, the message of miracles is only superseded by the message of love.

If you are willing to challenge your faith, and make a radical change then this dvd is for you. Even if you are not ready, I assure you, by the time you look at this, you will need to make a decision.

3297539,5,B00116495O,"There is a deep hunger within every person for something more. Many people fill this need with material things, and this movie gives us revelation of a God who interacts with his people and has the capacity to satisfy the deepest yearnings of our Spirit. I was thrilled to see things I had been hearing about for some time captured on camera, and it was refreshing to see a perspective that doesn't put God in a box. As the movie portrays, definitions of ""weird"" and ""normal"" are relevant to culture, and Psalm 115:3 is an excellent description of God. `God is in heaven; he does what pleases him.'  Darren Wilson does a great job of taking viewers all over the world to witness God's mighty, loving hand upon a desperate people. I have read a number of books and listened to many podcasts from the leaders in the movie, and they are re-discovering what it means to be a follower of Jesus. This movie stirs something within believers to return to a life that is naturally supernatural. Let this movie draw you closer to Jesus and spur you to action.

Finger of God has the potential to change the way the people of God `do church.' It will cause you to read scripture as if the things that happened in the Bible are still happening today, because they are... As illustrated in the movie, the gifts of the Spirit provide a powerful testimony of Jesus. These gifts function in both the North American church and the world.

3297540,5,B00116495O,"Whether you are born again, call yourself a believer in Jesus, attend any church or are in any way whatsoever seeking God, you must see Finger of God by Darren Wilson. You may want to follow it up with watching his interview with Sid Roth by googling Sid's site, ""It's Supernatural"". Darren didn't want to make this film, but he was called to do it. He had never made a film and was pursued by God until it was completed. You simply will never see anything else like it. His style is fresh, honest and sincere. He is a transparent, funny, talented storyteller and the content of God's working miracles everyday, everywhere is nothing short of amazing. Please buy or rent this film, gather two or more if you can, throw a seeker party and enjoy God. In my opinion the strongest witness in this film is the disclosure of why would anybody lie about miracles like these that happen to them? And over and over, when they have nothing to gain? Darren, congratulations and please, when God calls you to make another film, don't run so long, just get to it. You know you are going to anyway!

3297543,4,B00116495O,"I thought Finger of God was a very well done and powerful movie.  Now I admit that I'm a member of the choir, so I had no problem with belief in the miraculous before I even popped the DVD into the machine, so naturally there was going to be a lot here that moved me.  I did, however, want to make a few points about some of the material.

The film includes a story of a Buddhist monk whom we are told was dead for several days, and was miraculously revived after what most would think of as far too long a period of time for such a thing to be possible.  Upon returning to the realm of the living, the first he says to his fellow monks is, ""I saw the Buddha burning...we must listen to the Christians.""  This is the problem I've been struggling with for years.  The historical Buddha lived 500 years before the birth of Jesus.  Why would he be punished with eternal hellfire because he was born too early in history, and in a place on the planet to have ever had the opportunity to hear about the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, never mind anything about his only begotten Son, Jesus?  Is that to say that every soul born before the birth of Christ is burning as well?  I can not believe this to be the case.  I have studied Buddhism and find it very compatible with the teaching of Jesus...nearly parallel.  I'm by no means a Buddhist, but this message is very troublesome.  Does this mean that every aborigine that lived in the Australian outback 3,000 years ago is frying in hell?  Weren't they also made in the image of God?  The Buddha wanted to eradicate suffering from the world...this is a bad thing?

Anyway, there was much of the DVD that I would love to say my Amens and Hallelujahs to without question, but there were no actual miracles caught live as they happened.  I'm not saying that means miracles didn't happen...but I'm not ready to jump in with both feet and believe the whole precious gems, manna and gold teeth thing mindlessly.  I'm reminded of that line about keeping an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.  Sure that homeless man could have been healed as the camera was rolling, or it could have been a well rehearsed act.  Sure, those people could have had gold teeth appear miraculously in their mouths, or they could have been there for years.  Too much of what the Darren Wilson tells us we have to take on faith (no pun intended).  I don't think he was lying or making it up, mostly because I can't imagine what his motivation would be to do so.  I believe Wilson was making a sincere effort here and much of Finger of God is extremely powerful, especially the parts filmed in Africa and China.  More than anything else, this film reminded me that light pierces even the deepest darkness, and evil can not persist as long as love exists in the world.",1211500800,7,2801,4.354527938342967
3297544,5,B00116495O,"Watching this video is like reading the book of Acts in the New Testament, but instead of a group of Jews 2000 years ago, there are people from all over the world experiencing the power of God today.  I don't give it 5 stars for the quality of the presentation, but for the information that is compiled.  It is truly amazing to hear accounts from all over the world about the works of the Lord.

The author travels from California to Africa to Eastern Europe to interview and minister with preachers who are seeing masses come to Christ through the miraculous works of the Holy Spirit.

His interviews include Bill Johnson, Jason Westerfield, Christ Overstreet, George Banov, Heidi and Rolland Baker, Sid Roth, and a host of others.

The stories in the video are so amazing, that they are hard to believe, but he does stress that no one has any reason to make them up.

It is not a movie about religion, far from it- instead its a movie about God, and sharing God's love, not his rules.  If you have yet to experience the transforming power of the Holy Spirit, this will  movie will rock your mind and touch your heart.",1210118400,4,1119,4.477832512315271

But if you suspect that there is more to this life, more to who you are and INFINITELY more to who God is, than you need to watch this film.  ""Finger of God"" will challenge all of your preconceived notions about whether or not the Creator still cares/sees/acts/lives today.  The film immediately thrusts you to the edge of your comfort zone, pushes you past the walls of your ""god-box"", and brings you face to face with the truth about what you are truly willing to believe.  The film maker forces you to look at YOUR heart, at YOUR faith, and asks YOU the hard questions:  ""Could God still raise a man from the dead?  Does He still do miracles like that today?  Would He?  What do you REALLY believe?  Why?""

If your wondering whether or not there is more to Christianity than ""doing church"", if you have doubts about what God is willing and able to do in YOUR life today, or if you just love to see how great is the love that the Father has lavished on us, than this film is definitely for you.",1207872000,7,1127,4.3238095238095235
