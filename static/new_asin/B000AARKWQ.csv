8595450,5,B000AARKWQ,"This is the last of the 3 episode releases (6 per DVD starting next year). For most of Cases (seasons)4 and 5, I've liked 2 of the stories and the other was just okay. But on ""Covering Up"" all 3 are quite good. ""Dead Hobo"" is a nice change of pace and my favorite of these.

Together with ""Phantom Thief"", this is the best of Case 5.",1135728000,8,333,3.970149253731343
