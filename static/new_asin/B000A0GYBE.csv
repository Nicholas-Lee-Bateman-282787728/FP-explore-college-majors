8071759,5,B000A0GYBE,Love Pippi Longstocking!,1453334400,,24,7.333333333333333
8071760,5,B000A0GYBE,"This is my fave Pippi movie.  It's a refreshing light hearted fun movie that is innocent and pure.  It's so different than the stuff they have for kids in today's times.  Kids are so jaded now, I don't even know if they would enjoy this type of movie.  I'm in my 30's and still love and appreciate Pippi. She helps people out and has a kind soul, and it's fun to watch her live her life with a free spirit.  I also love the animals in the film, I love her pet monkey, he is soooo cute! I'm glad they actually have this on dvd, it's a cool movie to watch when your tired of all the violence and chaos of the real world.",1375833600,6,618,3.9516129032258065
8071761,5,B000A0GYBE,"My daughter loved it!!! Happy face for mommy! and it was refreshing to see a fully dressed, no make-up, kooky girl on TV!",1325721600,4,121,4.304347826086956
8071762,5,B000A0GYBE,This one was for me I used to watch pippi all the time.  In 2004 I tried to find pippi on dvd and it was not available.  The TV series was but that was not the same.  This is one of my favorite purchases!!,1318204800,3,205,3.6136363636363638
8071763,5,B000A0GYBE,"I grew up watching this series on tv every weekend, and was very happy and surprised to be able to buy it on dvd finaly. I refuse to acknowledge the movie othere than it didn't have the dreams, hopes, and kindness, and true frindeship and family like the originals did.
Thank you for giving me the insight of just because your different, doesn't mean you can't be my friend and we can have alot of fun together.",1291161600,,411,4.35064935064935
8071764,1,B000A0GYBE,"I was disgusted when I opened this purchase.  Number one, it came from a library somewhere where someone then decided to sell it to me.  Number two, the CD looked like a child had taken a penny to the back of it and scratched it to no end.  It amazingly played through to the end of the first scene, then crashed the DVD player after that.  I ordered this for my nieces for Christmas, but had to order another one because of the horrible condition.

I would have liked to know that it was unplayable and not just lightly used.  I would not give this seller any stars and it makes me very cautious when ordering from Amazon again.  I would have asked for a refund but there was no way to contact the seller.",1264896000,,706,4.185185185185185
