7799459,3,1585870579,"If you enjoyed this movie it's worth knowing that Samuel Landau, who played the cello-playing father, died in the Warsaw Ghetto in the summer of 1942. Many of the other leads in this movie were either born in America (Picon) or emigrated there in the 20's or 30's, The extras perished in the ghettos or the death camps with very, very few exceptions.",1420243200,,350,4.571428571428571
7799460,5,1585870579,Nice to see it restored better than it's original film.  Enjoyed watching this classic.  We saw the original back in the 70's direct from Molly Picon.  We will enjoy it for many years to come.,1364083200,,192,4.428571428571429
7799461,4,1585870579,"Molly Picon plays her usual boy role, but this was filmed on location in Poland in 1936.  The images of pre world war II Jewish life in Poland are compelling and, in hindsight, sad.  The quality of the DVD is more than adequate given the age of the orginal.  It would be nice if the subtitles could be turned off.  The songs are classic, the acting overblown but in the style of the Yiddish film.  This film holds up reasonably well.  You will need tissues to dry tears when you watch it; at least I did",1257638400,6,503,4.1875
7799462,3,1585870579,"I feel that the picture and sound quality of this film is not as good as the VHS version, also produced by the National Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis University, which I so much enjoyed watching.  The film seems to pause frequently. The sound seems to be a little distorted.",1196899200,10,279,4.470588235294118
7799463,5,1585870579,"I first saw YIDL MITN FIDL (YIDDLE WITH HIS FIDDLE)when I was ateenager in the late '70s. It was shown on a rickety old filmprojector at a Workmen's Circle Center in NYC. Most of the audience were seniors in their 70s & 80s. They laughed and cried at all the appropriate moments but, what struck me most of all, was how they hummed and sang along with the musical's songs.... Definitely, for 92 minutes, these ""bubbes und zeydes"" (grandmas and grandpas) were transported back to their youth in a world long since vanished.
The memory of that film and that evening has stayed with me all these years, so you can imagine my delight to find YIDL available on video. To be sure, it ain't cheap-- but this priceless cultural treasure is worth every penny. It was shot on location in a Polish shtel (rural Jewish markettown) in 1936, with the Jewish and Polish locals filling in as extras, making it a rare window into a way of life destroyed by the Holocaust. As a veteran ""busker,"" I especially enjoyed the scenes of Yiddle and her fellow klezmorim (traditional Jewish musicians)trying to make a living playing on the street for tips. Here the satisified listeners tossed the klezmorim ""k'nipples"" (folded hankys containing a few coins) from their windows as payment. It reminded me of a story my maternal grandmother once told me of an incident from her childhood. Grandma Lena was born in Ukraine and grew up in New York City's immigrant Jewish ghetto in the early 1900s. It seems that one day there was an impromptu concert on her street.  Just like in the film, her mother and the women in their tenement tossed k'nipples to the busking klezmorim from their fire escapes.
Like most American-born Jews, my Yiddish is confined to the smattering of choice words and phrases that has been euphemistcally described as ""Yinglish."" Still, even if your Yiddish is nonexistent, I know you'll enjoy this musical comedy. It's got romance, screwball ""shtick,"" great tunes and a wedding (nu, what's a Yiddish theatrical production without a wedding! )... what more could you ask for?
