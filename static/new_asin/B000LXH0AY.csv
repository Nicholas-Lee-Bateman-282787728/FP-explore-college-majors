2716078,5,B000LXH0AY,I switch between this and the broadway version. They are both amazing and are only a little different. This version does not have all the songs (but does have the main ones) and a couple of them are switched around most likely due to some songs being repeated throughout the broadway version that would not work for the movie. The story is the same and both make me cry uncontrollably. I first saw rent this way and wanted to see the play but never got a chance until the dvd came out. The story introduces us to 3 guys where there used to be 4 that live or squat in the same apartment. Everyone else is brought in through one or more of those guys and have their own story. The songs are all fantastic and contain a lot of heart. Its a rollercoaster that once you get off you look at the world a little differently. And at the end I always say Angel...,1514505600,,853,4.175757575757576

2716083,5,B000LXH0AY,"Rent is one of those movies that made people think about the hard truth of what was going on in the world. I have lost count of how many times that I have watched this but I will never stop watching it. I know that I will cry every time I see it but that does not stop me. I wish it was talked about more, and I wish that high schools around the world could do this show since it is so impactful.",1512864000,,396,3.7261904761904763

2716089,4,B000LXH0AY,"I'm not sure whether or not it was listed as such, but this DVD is set for the wrong country. It wasn't made very clear in the listing or perhaps I just overlooked it.

2716095,5,B000LXH0AY,"Nothing beats the Broadway RENT, but this is a great reminder. For those who saw the original musical, be prepared for Hollywood. You might feel it's overdone. That said, it's a great story, great music and good cast (Taye Diggs fans will love)!",1508457600,,245,4.72093023255814
2716096,2,B000LXH0AY,"Kinda wondering why this is so popular. Maybe the Broadway version was better? Or is it a Crash situation where everyone fell in love with it because they were supposed to?

Music is meh, acting is eh, just a waste of time.",1507939200,,223,4.309523809523809
2716097,5,B000LXH0AY,One of my favorite movies. This is proof positive for me that things can happen around you and you ca have no idea what's going on; unless you are personally affected. I had no clue what the HIV/AIDS struggle was in it's original discovery. I've always believed that with a solid friend base life can be more pleasant. Hold dear to the ones you love and who love you.,1507334400,,367,4.333333333333333

2716106,4,B000LXH0AY,I like this musical. I prefer musicals to have a good balance of song and story. Rent has too much song and not enough story for me.,1503878400,,132,3.925925925925926

After learning about the authors story made me love it even more! I can see why some people were disappointed with it, but that does not spoil it for me at all. Great movie!",1499212800,,340,4.014705882352941
2716116,2,B000LXH0AY,"I didn't see the Broadway play, so unfortunately can't compare the 2. The movie was mediocre. I am a Rosario Dawson fan, so I watched it for her. (I think she did a nice job, and she is stunning on camera.) The movie came off as very clich, and didn't delve deep enough into the characters' mindsets. The music can't compare to other Broadway soundtracks like Les Mis, Cats, Miss Saigon, etc. whose melodies are timeless. I am all for celebrating the Bohemian, free-spirited soul, but this movie did not capture it. It just glamorized addiction and over-indulgence, and provided a shallow look at more serious issues. What I hated most of all is the jesting about animal cruelty. The characters find it amusing that Angel helped kill a poor dog for $1,000? Why is it that the characters groan about living in the margins of society and not getting respect, and here they are not respecting the life of a beautiful animal? I'd rather listen to Evita's barking than to their whining about the unfairness of paying rent. Can't believe the writers didn't remove the jokes about animal cruelty, as it is ironic to expect us to mourn the human loss in the film, yet laugh at the loss of life cruelly inflicted upon another living, breathing soul.",1498608000,,1240,4.666666666666667
2716117,1,B000LXH0AY,"I know they mention not paying rent at the beginning of the movie, but I thought this would be resolved by the end. You can't just not pay rent. Very unbelievable and I am very disappointed in those kids.",1498435200,,204,4.256410256410256

2716124,2,B000LXH0AY,"Choose to watch Trainspotting instead.

This is an incoherent stew of underdeveloped ideas; these characters spend a year singing about how there's no tomorrow which only makes sense when you realize that there was also no yesterday when they met. There's actually quite a lot to explore there in the psychological effects of precariousness, but the script wants to romanticize it rather than explore it. The material just isn't up to the performance the cast gives it.",1494460800,,469,5.090909090909091
2716129,5,B000LXH0AY,"I love this movie, adapting from the Broadway musical of late Jonathan Larson. The songs were memorable, the cast was great, and the dramatic scenes between two key characters were very inspirational.

2716142,1,B000LXH0AY,This was painfully tedious to sit through.  There were a few good scenes but it just didn't mesh well together as a finished product.

Not a fan. They also completely removed the ensemble pieces and most of the talk/sing dialogue. So all chorus numbers (but Life Support and Will I) were completely removed, or alluded to with spoken words and no song :(

Very cool to see most of the original cast again though! Jesse L Martin will always be my favorite Tom Collins :)",1486339200,,631,4.3931623931623935

The story based on ""La Vie Boheme"" rings just as true for New York City in 1989-90, although I was interested to learn that most of the movie was actually shot in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of the young actors who became stars from the stage versions of the musical have gone on to big roles in film and television, and also on Broadway once more.

Can't say how much I love this musical ... I did not see the play live yet... I saw the movie after it came out....  I just rewatched it last week and I think I cried more this time... ... Anything I don't like? The ""death of the Akita"" --- don't enjoy violence to animals even if implied and not part of reality, in fact that disturbs me quite a bit that one of the characters does this for money, but then we can't eat our morals can we? ...  as well as the ""la vie bohme"" song... alternate lifestyle is fine... I live one. I don't need to hate people who don't understand or don't want to live that... I especially am tired of the ""hating mom and dad"" theme...

How much more perfect of a gag gift idea could I have come up with!  I immediately thought of this movie, which I own and enjoy myself, and had to find it.  Turns out that Amazon is one of the few places that you can find it!  It was perfect!

When the gift arrived, it was perfectly sealed and ready for gifting!  When my sister opened it, it was in perfect condition!  She was super excited about not only the disc but the special features that came with it!  The case was in one piece and both discs were secured firmly in place.  While the movie has very few similarities to her situation (other than the struggle to pay rent), it's a fun movie to watch if you enjoy musicals!

2716540,2,B000LXH0AY,"I really didn't mind the play but I didn't think it was bad, nor did I think it could be made into a good movie. And I was right, it didn't make a good movie.

The first thing you're really gonna notice is the lack of chemistry between the cast. It's odd because this is almost the exact same cast from the play. Rosario Dawson is the only actress and character I liked. That's because she's the most believable and most realistic out of them all. Everyone else comes off as generic characters and have nearly only one character trait.

The runtime isn't that long, so why was I begging for it to end? I think it's because there were 525,600 songs within this movie. The only good one was the opening song, everything else wasn't that great. They weren't all necessarily bad songs, but they weren't done properly thanks to the poor direction of Chris Columbas. Every song feels like it's going on forever and the only good songs end suddenly. It makes no sense why they have to all be so long. In other musicals, there would be dancing and other things to keep you entertained. Here though there's just people singing and barely moving. That's fine if that's what you like, but in a movie there's supposed to be excitement and awe overtheir singing and other things going on.

No character is developed, the story goes on forever, and the cast has terrible chemistry. I did like a few songs, but overall I was just begginifor them to stop singing. They're not bad actors and they can all sing really well, im so shocked that this movie didn't offer more and that this movie wasn't better. If you're a fan of the musical, you might love this movie. But I was a fan and I did not. Everyone else whose never heard of Rent and never saw the musical will probably pass out from boredom and hoping it ends soon.",1452038400,,1805,4.414414414414415

2716546,3,B000LXH0AY,"I wanted to see this movie for ages because I love musicals and heard this was the best of the best. I love Rosario Dawson she's one of my favorite actresses from the other work I've seen of her. She was really nice in this but all in all it did feel a bit jumpy for me. I was confused half the time because of the jumping around.  It didn't feel as fluid as it could have been.

I do like the idea of this musical and how it all ended and the music for the most part I was really enjoying. I just couldn't feel completely connected to anyone in this movie even Rosario who I love. I just didn't connect to this movie or the characters. I think it's because of how the movie went together. It might have been the film style.

I do recommend this to musical lovers because even though I didn't completely love this movie you might really enjoy it!",1449014400,,846,4.0843373493975905

I like that they had the original broadway cast (or most of it) in the movie in theory, but in practice, it was kind of weird to have all these 30-something actors trying to pass for 20-somethings.

2716607,5,B000LXH0AY,"This movie typically gets a bad rap from hardcore RENTheads (I consider myself one) because it doesn't follow the staged musical word for word and leaves out some songs/scenes. I, on the other hand, think this film adaptation is marvelously done. Because this is a film, the events are happening out in the real world, not on a stage, so of course there will be differences. The entire script cannot be sung (as in there needs to be some dialogue), and obviously they have to change around some of the words in the dialogue so every other word doesn't rhyme as each would in a song. That wouldn't be very realistic either. What really sold me the most was Chris Columbus' decision to use three quarters of the OBC in the eight principle roles, as well as Tracy Thomas (she has played the role on Broadway) and Rosario Dawson (a surprisingly beautiful singer who does an heartfelt portrayal of Mimi). There have been so many musical film adaptions in the past that I have been disappointed with (Phantom, Mama Mia, etc.) because the ... hired Hollywood stars who had weak voices and no personal connection with the roles. ""Rent"" is one of the only modern musical movies that defies this stereotype with a phenomenal cast of actors/singers who have abundant experience in musical theatre. Whether you are a RENThead or have never seen the staged show, you should watch this film.",1430006400,,1377,4.717842323651452

2716790,1,B000LXH0AY,"I had to watch this for a online college class I am taking and I hated it.  I wasn't alone.  Nearly everyone in the class thought it was awful.
How do you measure a year?  For me, a year was what the 135 minute film of the play RENT felt like.  When I rented this movie to watch it for this class, my son asked me what I was watching.  When I told him he said, ""oooh, I'm sorry"".  I thought he was just being contrary.  But, no.  This movie was just bad.  The themes of homelessness, poverty, AIDS, illness and family troubles were tackled in this movie.  I have never seen the play.  I know the play ran for a long time and I know that the play won Pulitzer and Tony Awards.  So, I have to assume the real RENT was better than the movie I watched.  Alot better.  I couldn't connect with the characters and the music/lyrics seemed disjointed and lacked flow.",1408924800,,858,4.121212121212121

My daughter and I watch this film every year. Rent captures the spirit of a people who is filled with love, compassion and commitment towards themselves and their beliefs. It shows how your life could suddenly change in a year.

I also found it amazing how the cast was able to express what it is like to be poor. How they were cold and hungry and still managed to do what they do. Starving artists, friends, lovers, family. This is a heart breaking, gripping and raw look into the lives of people who do what they can to make it in this world.

This was Jonathan Larson's gift to the world. What a great gift it was. Generations will now understand the effects of poverty, AIDS, caring and friendship because of him. He found that one song, that one last glory before he transcended. Make sure you get the live Broadway version too. Powerful, heart wrentching story telling.",1398643200,,1012,4.406417112299465

In what universe is this supposed to take place? Certainly not NYC at any time in its history. Who are these people and why should we care about them? What is the point of all this angst? The singers are great, the music is passable, although the lyrics are simplistic and obvious. Did this show really win a Pulitzer Prize?

2716900,1,B000LXH0AY,"This story is so lame, it has to serve as testimony of where we are in American culture. People who can't pay rent living in spacious NY loft apartments. All clean shaven and well scrubbed actors, supposedly creative people ""living on the street"". Yet, they miraculously always have a job when needed, safe shelter and plenty to eat. There are no homeless people over the age of 30 and everyone seems to dress well and have nicely furnish squatter's quarters. Perhaps one of the writers, directors or producers should have made a sharp left at their limo door, walked down a street that is not Broadway or inside of a theater and discover that ""homeless"" isn't a bohemian life style, but rather a dangerous, dirty desperate way of life. Boring look at the self serving, over indulgent entertainment industry.

They translated a musical that is perfect for the stage into a likable film, adding certain depth/understanding to certain issues. Most of the cast returns and deliver another great musical performance. Portions of songs are cut out and/or changed into dialogue but this is done for stylistic reasons, for helping the story flow on film. By turning the musical into film, I can soon, when it's on sale, watch it whenever I want. However, if you like the movie, see it on stage. It's a great experience",1361404800,,626,4.598214285714286

I have seen this at least a dozen times and the story, the music, and the acting are all just superb. I don't think I have to go into too much detail of the films subject matter, as most people already know what the film is about.

There are funny moments, sad moments and there are moments that will make you cry. I am glad this film was made to keep alive the underlying issues facing our society straight ,gay, black, white, or any race, religion or social status.

2716941,5,B000LXH0AY,"I became an instant ""RENT-head"" when I saw this movie.  So many aspects in this movie - the struggle for integrity and self-expression in a conformist culture, the struggle for survival as an artist in a setting of poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, and life-threatening disease (AIDS); the struggle to relearn trust after tragedy.  The songs are addictive too! - they run the gamut from joy and humor to tragedy and mourning to defiance and triumph.
 The second disc has a wonderful documentary about Jonathan Larson and how RENT came to be, along with scenes that weren't included in the final edit.
I recommend this movie for ANYONE over the age of 16.",1355702400,,659,4.866071428571429

Although the movie is set in the 1980's the musical version I had seen portrays Roger to be more of a 90's grunge rocker modeled after Kurt Cobain. It really peaked my interest to see the differences in how the musical I saw portrayed characters differently. The movie version has an outstanding cast such as Rosario Dawson and Ty Diggs. If you're a Rent fanatic this is a must have. However, if you are a general fan of musical you will also enjoy this movie",1354838400,,604,4.353982300884955

2716953,1,B000LXH0AY,"I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of musicals, including modern rock musicals, but I hate ""Rent"" (including the original play). Trying to persuade me with desperate fan comments will be a waste of your time. The characters are not likable; they are one dimensional, frivolous, and self-centered. Also the entire reason we are supposed to feel bad for them is because they have aids. Aids is a serious illness that shouldn't be made light of as it is in this horrible production. If you want to see a good play/movie about aids awareness, go see ""Angels in America"" instead. Furthermore the story line is slow moving and (obviously because of the weak characters) boring. However, if you've never met a gay person or a stripper before and you think that aids is trendy and fun, this is the movie for you.",1352419200,,817,4.5646258503401365
2716954,4,B000LXH0AY,"I don't get why some people hate this film so much.
Yes, the energy is different from the staged production. Yes, some of the shorter songs (voicemails, etc) have now become spoken dialogue--but the changes are all necessary when you go to the medium of film.

I think Chris Columbus did a great job, and clearly wanted to celebrate and honor Larson's vision--the man even sought out the original cast (Daphne was pregnant at the time of filming so she couldn't play Mimi, and Fredi Walker thought she was too old to play Joanne) in order to accomplish that goal.

Perhaps the studio's error was in cleaning up the sound. The show was such a success because it was so raw and at times unpolished, maybe that's where the film sort of fails--the music is too polished, too clean. Mimi doesn't sound as wild and as desperate to live her life now because she knows death is knocking at her door. (Not knocking Rosario's Mimi, I loved her), Roger isn't as angry, as volatile.

With that said, the film was my introduction to RENT and holds a special place in my heart. Since then,I've seen the staged version a number of times at the Nederlander (even saw Adam and Anthony as Roger and Mark) and saw the revival when it was at the New World Stages theater. Each time the energy was different, the portrayals were different --but the message was the same. Life is fleeting. Love now. Live now. Because there is no day but today. And if that message comes through, then the medium RENT is conveyed through, whether film or stage, has done its job.

2716957,5,B000LXH0AY,"would have approved of the movie version (RIP Jonathan). I thought the movie was extremely faithful to the stage musical. The first time I saw the movie I didn't think so, but after seeing the show a few more times and seeing the movie again I have come to the conclusion that the movie did the stage musical justice. Yes, they should've cut the weddiing scene in half and kept the rest of ""Goodbye Love"" and ""Halloween"", but you can't have everything the musical has. I also loved how they subtly used some of the lyrics of other minor songs as dialogue. Honestly, I'm glad ""Contact"" was cut. That song didin't need to be in the movie. I still think the stage musical will always be better, though. Since there are so many liberties these days with adaptations movie musicals don't follow the stage musical as faithfully as they used to. I'm not saying they don't follow them at all. They do. Just not as exact. So, I thought Rent was one of the better adaptations produced in the last decade.",1342483200,,994,4.497237569060774

Idina Menzel, Anthony Rapp, and Adam Pascal?!) What's not to love? Well, several things. They took about a few key parts which made the movie lack some depth, while adding parts that weren't seen in the musical. The part that I found most disappointing were the voicemails being spoken instead of sang... Although, technically it makes more sense that, but I feel as though the singing brought some quirkiness to Mark's parents which I loved. The technical problem I had with the DVD was that I'm not able to turn off subtitles which is fairly annoying seeing as I already know the show line for line. So honestly, but the Filmed Live On Broadway version (no original cast, but Eden Espinosa, Adam Kantar, and Will Chase do a pretty good job too), I guarentee you will like that version more, but if you happen to have some spare money and want to watch it for the sake of watching it like I did, it's worth the $10....",1339804800,,1092,4.410891089108911

2716978,4,B000LXH0AY,"There's no way a movie can duplicate the intensity of a live performance experience.  (And I think I have enough experience to confidently say that this is just as true for the cast as it is for the audience.) But I am finding the difference easier to ""forgive"" than some other reviewers.

Chris Columbus was, I think, justly criticized for his Harry Potter adaptations being ""too faithful.""  But the tendency to faithfulness worked very well here.  He cut a few numbers, made minor concessions to realism, and took advantage of things that the live stage could not in terms of scale: filming on a rooftop and a desertscape for What You Own, a huge ballroom for Tango Maureen, and the beautiful church in which his few close friends look positively lost during Angel's memorial service.  Same with the audio production techniques, which are closer to what we're accustomed to in rock albums than on a stage.  The extremely slow tempo at which Collins starts the ""I'll Cover You"" reprise belongs in that category also: I think that is too hard to attempt when you have to do it live every night, but it is incredibly powerful here.

All in all, I think the only thing I missed about the movie was that Mark had less depth: his very raw and emotionally intimate relationship with Roger, his vulnerability and his isolation, all of which comes out in the longer, original version of ""Goodbye Love,"" were not obvious enough and so he was just not as sympathetic as the rest of the characters.  Oh, and I would have liked the scenes of the HIV support group to have been explored a bit more.  But really, as long as you don't hold it to the impossible standard of having the same intensity as live theater, it is quite good.",1307836800,,1719,4.591503267973856
2716979,4,B000LXH0AY,"I love ""Rent,"" and while theatre critics felt some of the songs were a little lightweight for Broadway, I still find it tuneful and powerful.  But in spite of the sadness and drama that surrounds the content of ""Rent,"" it was mostly fun and some of it almost intentionally camp.  So the film comes along, being as faithful as it can, removing some of the long windedness of some numbers and characters, but also robbing ""Rent"" of some of its fun, but it still mostly works.

The opening of the film is fantastic.  It ALMOST feels like they got the tone down and it looks like one of those classic openings to old musicals - lots of characters, big, flashy and very much in the spirit of the play.  The title number is trimmed, removing some of Joanne's banter and Benjamin's dialgoue.  It's a nice trim an arguable improvement.  It looks like Chris Columbus got this down initially.  And for the first part, the film flows pretty well - acting, music, pacing, fine.

It isn't until the arrival of Maureen that something doesn't seem right.  ""Rent"" was a piece carved for the stage and Jonathon Larson crafted some neat scenes for it.  The one that always stuck out was ""Christmas Bells,"" not only because to me, it's an important motif, but also because it really captured the grand thing ""Rent"" was, featuring alot of good character interplay and building up to the arrival of Maureen.  The way its dones on stage wouldn't carry well to the screen.  So Chris Columbus just kind of skips it, jumping to Maureens stage performance and to La Vie Boheme.  It was always a good piece in the stage play and it feels like there's a gap here in the film.

Act 2 seems a little sloppy, probably because of the staginess of so many scenes.  While the narrative remains effective and in tact, Columbus seems unsure how to do something with ""What You Own"" and creates soemthing that resembles an early 90s music video that's almost painful to watch.  Other than that, the second act works on screen, though it's not as well paced as the first part, or the play.

If I have any complaints, they mostly lie in the fact that ""Rent"" doesn't have as much fun as it should.  Yes, it's got serious subject matter, but it's loads of fun and celebration - and celebration was always key for Rent.  I feel like Columbus mourns the story a bit more.  Again, this could just be becaus of how the material transitions to screen.

Overall, Rent the  movie is good.  Just try not to compare it to the stage version.  If you want to see a good theatrical performance, check out the DVD of the last show.  Pretty good, in spite of not having the original actors.",1305590400,,2634,4.4926315789473685

2716995,2,B000LXH0AY,"Before I get to the review, confession time. Even as a theater extremist, I never liked Rent. OK people, go on and eviscerate me.

Why did I never like it? Maybe if I was born in the eighties or if I lived in New York, I'd like it. There were a few moments of brilliance in the show, and some catchy songs, but none of the positives ever added up really. It's really dated and cheesy, it's WAY too long, in fact I've had to scoff at a lot of my friends (as of recently) who worship it because of how dated, cheesy and laughable it is. Especially since I saw it for the first time on stage in 2009 and enjoyed the actors' performances but absolutely hated it. Even moreso, its cheesy lyrics prevent me from enjoyment, and half the songs are half-arsed copy and paste jobs. One particularly crowning moment of cringe worthy is ""Will I?"". Ugh, I had to sing that for a showcase and dreaded every second of it each night. ""Will I lose my diiiignityyy, will someone caaaare, will I wake tooomoroow[...] FROM!!! THIS!!! NIGHT!!! MAAAAAARE!!!!"" as if the lyrics weren't bad enough, it gets repeated what feels like 250 times. The worst part is when the song becomes an incomprehensible mishmash at the end with 20 different people singing at different times to the point where it sounds like ""Will someone care?"" is repeated over and over. I most certainly WON'T care, and I would if the characters didn't feel like stereotypes, cardboard cutouts and had any depth other than ""She's her lover/he's a drag queen/he's making a movie about their lifestyle/etc."" So as you could tell, there was no way I could imagine any of those craptacular songs or dated story translating to film.

A few nights ago this was on TV, starting at 10. That, with commercials, resulted in me staying up till 1 to watch a terrible movie based on a really crappy musical. However curiosity bit me in the ass and so I gave in and watched this film.

The good thing about this movie is that it's a terrible adaptation of the play. A lot of fanboys/girls have gotten angry over this but I was quite happy- at least half those craptacular songs were out of the question and songs were turned into dialogue to avoid me smashing my head against the nearest sharp object. Add to that some GREAT cinematography and visual brilliance. I liked the look of the film- fit the bohemian mood great. The cast wasn't that bad, some of them surprised me- specifically Maureen. She made me like ""Over The Moon"" actually. So in a way this film is better than the play but that's not saying much.

The songs somehow sound even more emo than the play- and mind-bendingly so. That, of course, is the result of a film exposing a play for how truly bad it is, showing the songs' true form. So that means ""Out Tonight"", ""Will I"", ""I Should Tell You"", and ""Light My Candle"" are more whiny, cheesy, and annoying than the stage play. And of course, the film drones on and on for too long, just like the play, but thankfully it's shorter. Were this film a minute longer I'd cry.

I'll go out on a limb and also state how I can't understand how the whole concept of ""Rent"" IN GENERAL has a huge fanbase. Am I gay? No. Do I enjoy watching stuff about AIDS? It depends on if its done tastefully. Maybe if I were in the gay crowd I'd be worshipping it just as much as everyone and their dog. No wait- even if I were gay I'd still hate its guts- Hell I even know gay people who hate Rent. I'll also go out on a limb and state I'll never, repeat, NEVER understand how teenagers adore it so much. As an adult, I find it so laughably dated and cheesy. I'll admit I wasn't born in the eighties, so maybe that's why I don't get some of the references. And yet people as young as 9 (bad parenting much? This film, here in Canada is rated PG, and in USA PG-13. I wouldn't recommend the play to anyone under 15 at all due to its content!) worship it! When I saw the stage production some time ago, a member of the cast stated on how difficult it was- for him as a straight man- to be able to pull off the role of a gay dude and make a man-to-man kiss look natural. Being an actor myself I know how difficult it is. Coincidentally that very person was one of my closest friends, whom I had seen the play for specifically (to be fair though, he did great for what he had to work with, so I'll give him that.). Honestly, even with its popularity among the LGBT community and what not, I fail to see the appeal of the show.

In short, this film is a 135 minute exercise in idiocy, but hey, at least it's keeping true to the true nature of the show. I go see a play like The Gershwins' Crazy For You or Kotis' Urinetown and am immediately transported to the locations those shows take place in (The setting of Deadrock, Nevada is one of the most fun settings for a show ever). I go see Rent and am transported to the top floor of a 40 story office building. This gets an extra star just for managing to cleverly depict the idiocy of the show on film.

2716997,5,B000LXH0AY,"""Rent"" is the film adaption of the broadway musical of the same name that deals with a bunch of young, starving singers living in New York City who struggle to make ends meet, while dealing with issues such as AIDS. These so-called ""bohemians"" become a family and it is the fact that they have each other to rely on when times are tough that gets them through the most difficult circumstances.

 ""Rent"" is based on Jonathan Larson's musical that garnered him a Tony and a Pulitzer prize, with the Broadway run being one of the longest in the Great White Way's history. Six of the original actors from the Broadway show actually reprised their role for the film. Among the outstanding cast include Taye Diggs, Tracie Thomas, Anthony Rapp, and Rosario Dawson.

 Some of the best songs in the ""Rent"" soundtrack include ""Seasons of Love"", ""One Song Glory"", ""Another Day"", and the title song.

 Although beloved by fans and critics alike (Ebert and Roeper gave the film ""Two Thumbs Up""), ""Rent performed poorly at the U.S. boxoffice raking in only $32,000,000 on a $40,000,000 budget.

Cinematically it's masterful, true to life, and wonderfully well cast and acted. Impeccable singing, powerful music, witty and brilliant lyrics combine intricately to deliver an exciting and transcendent experience.

Rent is the universal story of creative and artistic misfits trying to make it in the big city. It's a tale as old as civilization, which gives it added punch and turns the film into a wellspring of inspiration. It's a modern retelling of La Boheme, the classic French story, but is original in almost every way. The characters are fascinating, the music sounds new, and the vision of New York City looks and feels fresh as well.

It's a 'must see' for everyone who enjoys the mating of music, great storytelling, and powerful characters.

2717023,1,B000LXH0AY,"Here's why I love the Rent OBC/NYTW cast: Because they sound so real. Raw. Unpolished. Adam Pascal (okay, he wasn't in the early NYTW, but still) and Daphne Rubin-Vega stand out particularly; the prior had had no theatre experience pre-Rent (none! They found him singing with his band!) and the latter has such a unique, raspy sound. (Daphne also has been Mimi since the beginning. She played her originally, in the workshop, off-Broadway and on, as well as on the recording.) Maybe what I love about Rent is that it *doesn't* sound like a musical, it sounds so *real*. I also am always so impressed at how real the relationships seemed, and how the actors seem so connected to the characters (read any Daphne Rubin-Vega interview... she's like Mimi in a lot of ways).

That being said, I was very excited to watch the movie. I was incredibly disappointed. There, I said it. I hated it.

If you've heard the early recordings of Rent, you know that this show kept getting more and more commercial. I love the Broadway version (the originals are so angsty; not better, but  very... raw), but this movie was too much for me to handle. All their voices sounded so polished, many songs were cut, Joanne became a Soprano (huh?!), the plot changed (not quite has many break-ups, you'll notice, and Take Me or Leave Me was ruined), and I could not feel *any* of the relationships between the characters. Angel and Collins were the only two characters I could tolerate, but I'll Cover You was still too pop-y, though the I'll Cover You (Reprise) made their relationship slightly more real than the others. And what happened to Contact? Kinky, raw, fabulous Contact? Where did that song go? Not to mention Christmas Bells! And the Voicemails! And my favorite songs: Happy New Year A&B? How about Halloween and the rest of Goodbye, Love? (I watched them afterwards on the DVD; this was the only time I liked Rosario Dawson slightly, shame they cut it.) Bonus points for including some original cast members, I guess, but they looked so awkward on a movie set, not a stage (I miss Michael Greif's staging!!). And they didn't even film it entirely in New York! Instead of it being a true musical about bohemian life, it turned into ""Look how cool and fun being poor is! Hehe!"" The glamorized the issues seen in the musical. For the first time, the cast felt like actors to me, not like real people. All of them seemed so isolated.

Anthony Rapp: Without Halloween, I didn't grasp Mark quite as well. La Vie Boheme was too commercialized, and it showed. (Jonathan Larson wrote about things he loved. Hollywood Producers ruined that song.) I *loved* him in the show (and I was lucky enough to see him in it!), so the movie was a let down. I couldn't feel the Mark-Roger friendship, either. (As I say below, perhaps it's fame, but Anthony wasn't as connected to Mark as usual).

Adam Pascal: Sounded too theatre-y, too commercial, and I felt *nothing* between him and Rosario (it's alright, I hate her too, Adam), nor the friendship between him and Anthony. Adam Pascal had such an amazing, raw and real sound; it was polished over here, and it took loads of the emotion away. And what happened to Roger being more, well... angsty and bad-ass? Hmm? I miss the eyeliner and the nail polish. His character was seriously watered down. (Plus Roger is with April when she gets her HIV results in this movie, so it's assumed she didn't commit suicide but died from something HIV-related... as another reviewer mentioned, I felt this took loads away from his character). Maybe to widen the appeal, make the movie more socially acceptable? This Roger seemed sad, not angry. Meh. I love Adam, and I saw him on tour last year, so I know he capable of being *amazing*. Which is why I'm so sad he wasn't. (Maybe fame does this to people, but I felt like he wasn't as connected to Roger in the movie. Maybe because he already has 'glory'?)

Idina Menzel: Again, I felt no relationships, this time between Maureen and Joanne. Her voice sounds too polished as well, and Idina didn't need it! She's amazing anyways! They should have left her how she is, because here she just sounds fake. This Maureen was rather toned-down, as well, though probably to make the movie have wider appeal. The engagement mess irritated me. I did not like it.

Tracie Thoms: I did not like her, but I suppose she did the role some justice. Making Joanne a soprano took, for some reason, something away from her character for me, and her voice sounded fake. She didn't seem to have the strength and intelligence stage-Joanne had, but she did alright. Her relationship with Idina was non-existent, in my opinion. Again, I was annoyed with Take Me or Leave Me.

Jesse L. Martin: Good! Only character I felt they really did preserve, kudos to him. Still a little to edited, though.

Wilson Jermaine Heredia: Without Contact we lost some of him (her?), in my opinion. I missed Angel's witty lines in Happy New Year, as well! But this character held okay... I don't remember having any specific complaints. Wilson and Jesse had the only believable relationship.

Taye Diggs: ... Meh. He was alright. The fact that You'll See was so early was enough to have me irritated with him from the very beginning, though of course that wasn't his fault. Some of Benny's character was simply deleted to me, there was something that made him feel less real. But he did well, better than most of the cast at least.

Rosario Dawson: I could rant *forever* on Rosario Dawson. I do on a daily basis. (I get really irked when people who saw the film then heard the original cast say that Daphne played Mimi wrong... she originated the role, people. She can't play her wrong). Yes, Daphne was seven months pregnant. Yes, she couldn't have done the movie. But did they have to bring in a *celebrity*? One who can't sing, nonetheless; her voice sounds like its been edited for three hours. Her Mimi was glamorous, and I despised that. The entire movie glamorized the issues in Rent, and Rosario Dawson was the worst of it. She and Adam didn't work, in my opinion (the only time they did was in one teeny part of the Without You montage, but I was so pissed there was a montage in the first place that I didn't really notice that the first time), though she was certainly pretty enough for the part. I miss Daphne's raspy voice (Mimi's an HIV+ stripper on drugs who most likely smokes. She needs a raspy voice.), I miss the connection between her and Adam, I miss seeing Daphne's struggles, her brilliant expression, and her amazing emotion. Rosario was emptier to me, and despite the fact that they replaced the original Mimi costume (Another thing: I. Loved. Those. Pants! They came from Daphne's *closet*! The majority of the costumes came from the actors closet! Realism! vs. Hollywood falsity) she was a watered-down Mimi, and just seemed like a whiny teenage brat.

I'm glad that the message of Rent is being spread, true, (although it brought a bunch of so-called Rent-heads who don't even know what they're talking about and have only seen/heard the movie, which drives me nuts) but did they have to do it in a way that seemed so... fake? All in all, stage-show for the win. By the OBC if you don't have access to it. Nothing beats the original.",1272326400,,7274,4.643356643356643

2717027,5,B000LXH0AY,"Quick, hold up your hands and do the Macauley Culkin pose in ""Home Alone."" You wouldn't think the director of this slapstick family film would later create a dramatic movie about love, loss, addiction and AIDS, with words such as dildos and S&M included in song.

But Chris Columbus did; and he delivered. His film version of Jonathan Larson's musical, ""Rent,"" is full of visual and emotional impact. The way he did one of the musical numbers alone makes the DVD worth owning. It's called, ""Without You,"" sung by Rosario Dawson and Adam Pascal.

In just four minutes, you experience:

- The devastation of drugs
Mimi (Dawson), spirals into the abyss of addiction. And if you think, ""Yeah, but Rosario Dawson is hot,"" well, she does a hell of a job inhabiting her inner junkie, and it ain't pretty. OK, maybe a little.

- The human impact of AIDS
As members of an AIDS support group talk, laugh and share their fears, some of them disappear one by one. You know they've been taken by the disease. It makes you see them as individuals, not statistics. When the camera falls on the character of Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), you notice how pale he looks, and you think, ""Oh noooooo...""

- The meaning of true friendship
When Angel is in the hospital dying from AIDS, Mimi provides simple joy by painting his fingernails blue. On another day, when he is shaking and dehydrated, she's there for him, feeding him ice chips. Wouldn't you want friends who'd do that for you? When you're at your worst and look like hell? I do.

- Unconditional love
Throughout Angel's final journey, he has the love and support of his partner, Tom (Jesse Martin), whose dreams for both of them resonates with vitality in an earlier scene on a subway train. Columbus returns to the train in ""Without You."" This time, however, Tom cradles a now sick Angel in his arms. It's the scene that starts the tears flowing, unless you're a cold, heartless buzzard. The song ends with a lifeless Angel, eyes open, being embraced by a grieving Tom. The sense of love and loss is palpable.

The director captured all of that in four minutes. Way to go, Columbus and crew.

----

Kudos to Rosario Dawson. You could see Mimi in her eyes and expressions, gestures, tears, even the way she sat--yes, sat--in her scenes. She shakes her leg with nervous energy in the support group meeting. She sits in utter dejection when an angry Roger walks away from her.

Oh, and she can dance. And sing. After you watch the ""Without You"" number on DVD, close your eyes and play it again. You can hear the tender emotion and hurt in her voice. Give the girl an Oscar.",1266624000,,2614,4.590128755364807

2717055,1,B000LXH0AY,"I saw Rent twice on stage and have the soundtrack memorized. I was excited to see it had come out on DVD as well... until I watched it.

Seeing it on stage was transcendent. This movie cut a bunch of the songs (time constraints?), cut many of the layers out of some songs that were kept (too hard to film on their budget?), and turned many lines that were sung in the original into spoken dialogue (wanted to make it a musical instead of a rock opera?), which felt awkward and flat.

They also changed parts of the story. For example, in the stage version, April left a note to Roger saying the two of them had AIDS and slit her wrist in the bathroom; in the film, he's standing beside her as she gets her test results and we're to assume she died of AIDS-related complications, which takes a lot of the punch out of Roger's character. In the stage version, all of Act One happens on Christmas Eve; in the film, it's split up into two (or more?) days for no apparent reason, which makes the lyrics of some later songs inaccurate. The conflict between Roger and Mark is entirely left out of the film.

I think the film version still delivers an important message, but it lacks a lot of the artistry and power of the original. I see that a filmed-on-stage version is now available, which wasn't the case when I bought this movie. I'd highly suggest getting that instead.",1246752000,,1368,4.377952755905512

It just doesn't work on the screen for me. Although you've got a top talented cast, the incredible energy and electricity that bolted across the stage are nowhere to be found here.

The musical is a nitty, gritty story based in dank, scroungy Village surroundings, filled with nitty gritty people living on the edge. Since I lived in NYC for 30 years, I instantly felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can't imagine.  But to spend two hours in a movie theater, watching this dank, depressing story unfold, is a dark experience.  The musical numbers all seem forced. The people aren't very likable. They're all too dramatic and intense for one's comfort zone and the reason the movie bombed, is that middle America probably couldn't understand why the people in this movie just didn't pay the damned rent--and avoid all the drama and problems!

This movie did very well in large cities where there were people who could identify with this bonhemian story of tragedy and AIDs. But even for someone like myself who is very familiar with this world, which takes place in the Village, where I lived, it's a dour, depressing experience with very little to feel upbeat about.

I couldn't sympathize with the druggies and the prosties nor did any of the musical numbers electrify. They should have gotten a fresh, new cast for the movie version and opened it up more from the dark, always damp, world that enfolds this film treatment.",1235606400,,1602,4.686832740213523

2717078,3,B000LXH0AY,"Many reviewers have identified various weaknesses in the film version of Rent.  These include overacting and lack of character development among the 8 primary characters. There are multiple plot lines that are more superficial than genuinely presented and fully developed as three dimensional characters rather than stereotypes.

And yet the translation from stage to screen was visually successful since stage-like settings were retained so that the film retained a feeling of a stage production. However, when the cameras come in close, the acting needs to be refined and toned down, which did not occur here. In fact, the boisterous overacting, over singing, could almost overpower a viewer since the cameras were too close to the actors, making them frighteningly loud and over-done.  This may seem like an odd comparison but The Sound of Music, when translated from stage to screen, toned down intimate numbers and conversations so as to try to capture some sense of realism (in a highly unrealistic optimistic overly sweet film).  The Sound of Music retained a sense of intimacy in many of the musical numbers, whereas Rent blasts you with every number, despite the emotional content. The overstatement that worked on the stage worked against the film with the exception of a sexy song, Light My Candle, which the characters Mimi and Roger played appropriately to the medium and the message.

Beside the translation from stage to screen, the film also had the problem of trying to reflect a point in the AIDS epidemic where the first medicines were appearing, for example AZT, but the efficacy of the medicines were limited. This period of time, 1988, was just prior to the protease inhibitor miracle of 1991-1995 when so many deaths were avoided and the life span of infected persons dramatically increased. Thus the film reflects a point in historic time in an epidemic that rapidly changed. Why should this detract?  After all, La Boheime is about a prostitute dying of tuberculosis. Distance makes the difference. We are not really able yet to understand and reflect upon the various stages of the AIDS epidemic and how various stages may have impacted person's perceptions of life and death, fatality and hedonism. This would mean that with time the film and stage production would actually improve so that future viewers were be able to say ""so that is what it was like on AZT in 1988.""",1231113600,,2398,5.027707808564232

2717095,2,B000LXH0AY,"The trouble with Rent is that most people see it for the surface plot, and take it as a musical about people with AIDS.  In fact, for some of the most die-hard fans, it took a few listens and years of letting the lyrics sink in to understand the message behind the story.  It's not a musical about AIDS; it's a musical about people learning to live life in the moment -- live for today -- and find happiness instead of dwelling in regret and indecision.  Any artist knows this feeling, and that's perhaps why so many fans are other struggling artists while people who are ""mainstream"" or professional don't find a connection with the story or its characters.

While the character relationships are inspired by the characters in La Boheme, the lyrics and the heart of this story are rooted in social issues that its creator dealt with; in struggling for his art, for his career, and while watching many of the people around him die.  Today we live in a society where having AIDS isn't so much of a death sentence with the proper care and medication... but in 1989, the first generations who had contracted it earlier and were now reaching the end of their lifespan were dealing with a much different life, involving a lot of confusion, fear, and regret.  The point is not that all of these people have AIDS; if you actually take the time to hear the words as a message and a lesson to learn, what you receive is very profound and eye-opening.  In fact, only 4 of the 8 main characters are ill.  No one complained that La Boheme, the world's most beloved opera, was about a bunch of people complaining about the plague; perhaps because it's easier to listen to people dwell on something we're not afraid of anymore.  AIDS makes people uncomfortable.

Contrary to the opinions of some viewers who feel that the costumes and sets and characters are cliche and almost caricature in nature... perhaps these people don't LIVE the life depicted in the musical.  After all, shows like Jesus Christ Superstar are just as ridiculous to me because of my religious beliefs -- or lack thereof -- and so one can't expect me to share the same appreciation for something I don't understand.  However, the people who do adore the musical will tell you that they also dressed that way and lived that way and that we are NOT caricatures to be made fun of.  I DID dress like that.  I WAS stared at by those who were conservative... but there are two kinds of audiences: those who look for entertainment value and those who appreciate the poetry and the symbolism.  After all, with the exception of Chicago, I loathe flashy, dancy musicals because I find them unrealistic and cheesy.  But that's just ME.

To say that this is clearly an amalgamation of stereotypes by a creator who didn't understand his material is utterly ridiculous if you take the time to read about Jonathan Larson and his life; especially what inspired him to write this musical in the first place.  To suggest that he was some big shot who thought it might be cute to write about this subject material without firsthand experience... well... maybe it is the reviewers who follow the stereotypes.  It is Mr. Larson who is also rolling in his grave.

What I WILL say about the Rent movie is that it stinks.  I was a Renthead who saw it every weekend during its run.  Call me crazy -- in retrospect I know it sounds lame -- but you also have to consider that some people go to church every week to reaffirm their belief system, while Rent taught me to appreciate life and where I am, regardless of the hardships.  To accept who I am and where I'm going without fear.  To trust in risk and not feel so obligated to follow the rigid, conservative structure we're pressured to comply with because of judgment and conformity.  In the end, as long as I love what I do and surround myself in people I love, happiness is with me.  That was a lesson worth every single one of those weekends... and it's clearly not what the opposition got from this musical, but it just goes to show you that there is something deeper than what's on the surface.  And that's a legitimate response.  Some people don't think they should have to get to know the show first, or spend more than one sitting in order to appreciate it.  Some people expect it to be laid out for them, to see a show and go home.  If you're expecting that, this isn't the kind of theatre you should see. It deals with many issues, from battling with your pursuit of your art versus ""the real world"", family obligations, love triangles, illness, inability to let people into your heart... all issues some of know quite well all our lives.  For the right person, it can be a very thought-provoking and life-changing experience with an important message.

But it was a message that did not come through when Hollywood tried to take control of the project.  Fans and newbies alike either love or hate this film, and I am thoroughly disappointed with it, despite the nostalgia of the (mostly) original cast members.  I just happened to see a new Rent movie this evening: the final Broadway performance -- filmed live on stage -- and I am finally satisfied that I have seen a proper Rent movie.  THAT is the movie I would recommend for someone wanting to experience the musical as it should be.  Even *I* found the Hollywood characters flat and hollow, but perhaps it's not a story for this kind of film, or perhaps the cut material made more of a difference than they anticipated.  Either way... there is not ""rap"" song.  I don't know WHAT that reviewer is talking about.  There are some weaker pieces -- which happens with musicals -- but the ones that snagged the followers are the ones with a message about acceptance, love, and living for the moment.

Ultimately, audiences either love or hate Rent, and the response is pretty predictable depending on where you came from, how creative you are, and the kind of social outlook you have.  And I don't mean social classes -- I mean just your social circle, career path, or view of city life.  This musical isn't for everyone, that's for sure.  But just because you didn't share our experiences doesn't make it bad or inaccurate; it just means you don't sympathize because it's not a story you relate to.",1222387200,,6246,4.564125560538117
2717096,3,B000LXH0AY,"Let me state that I have never been a fan of musicals. I loathed most of the Golden Age Hollywood musicals that my parents loved, and those from my youth, the 1960s and 1970s (Hair, Jesus Christ, Superstar, Godspell, etc.), did not move me, either- at least dramatically, even if the songs were great. There's something about people breaking out into song that is just so forced that, dramatically, is too much to overcome. Perhaps the only film musical that totally worked for me was Evita, and that's because it was one long music video, from beginning to end, with literally only one sentence of spoken dialogue. However, musicals have been making a comeback in film. Moulin Rouge led the way, a few years back, and it's a truly great musical, if not a film. Chicago won an Academy Award for Best Picture the following year, even though it's not half the film, nor musical, Moulin Rouge is. Then, came the Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely, and, well, Cole Porter, Cole Porter. It was a very good film that incorporated music wonderfully and intriguingly into its plot, the life's tale of the legendary composer. Next came Rent, the film version of Jonathan Larson's late 1980s musical that dominated Broadway last decade, which updated Puccini's opera, La Bohme for the AIDS era. Surprisingly, while only also a great composer of ballads and rip roaring rock tunes. Without doubt, Rent has as many great songs as Hair or Godspell ever did- perhaps more.
  Yes, the actual story the tale tells is slight and often silly, if I'm being generous....Yes, the characters are stereotypes and caricatures, there is no real development of their psyches, and the film ends in shameless melodrama- the abandoned and now homeless Mimi's death and resurrection, and preachiness- in its regard of the anomic, dead transvestite Angel as somehow the apex of the human experience. But, as I always asked people who harped about the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla, `What did you really expect from a film where a giant lizard stomps on New York; Brando in Streetcar?' Similarly, what can one reasonably expect from a work that glorifies AIDS suffering in such a Romantic light, as well the inanities and irresponsibilities of young drug addicts and sexual freak shows who somehow believe that the world owes them something merely for their breathing, and that having to actually pay rent to someone to live somewhere is a form of fascism? If you answered, `Well, maybe, good music,' you are absolutely right, and, fortunately, Rent has much of that to spare. Ultimately, the music, and Larson's brilliance in the crafting of his infectiously catchy tunes, is the film's saving grace. And, when has even a little bit of grace ever been a bad thing?",1221609600,,2733,4.887931034482759

Why do they think (as they sing in the opening number) that they should be exempt from paying rent like the rest of the world?

2717108,5,B000LXH0AY,"When `Rent' first took the stage at an off-Broadway theater in 1996 the history of theater instantly changed. Jonathan Larson composed the Pulitzer Prize winning revolutionary rock opera. Rent was loosely based on Puccini's opera `La Boheme'. Rent has been on Broadway for twelve years and will be closing September 7, 2008.
 RENT is about eight starving artists living during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 1989 living in the East Village in New York City. ""Measuring their lives in love"" the eight struggling bohemians must cope with poverty, illness, starvation, life, love and trying to pay off last year's and the current year's rent.
  The eight friends are Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), a nerdy love-struck film producer who is trying to get his big break. Rodger Davis (Adam Pascal) is a washed up songwriter with HIV whose girlfriend Amy recently died of AIDS. Mimi Marquez, the drug addicted dancer at The Catscratch Club who falls in love with Rodger. Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel) is a bisexual outspoken performer who dumped Mark for a lawyer named Joanne Jefferson. Joanne (Tracie Thoms) is a lawyer who is sick of Maureen mooning over other men and women. Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) is a computer-age philosopher at NYU with AIDS who falls in love with Angel Dumott Schunard, a gay Drag Queen street performer who ""provides a comfortable home for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" (Angel from ""You Okay Honey?"" song from Rent). Last but not least is Benjamin ""Benny"" Coffin III an old roommate of Mark, Collins, and Maureen who recently married Allison Grey of the Westport Greys and is now the landlord of Avenue A, who hopes to evict all the homeless from Alphabet City and build a cyber studio.
 Directed by Chris Columbus (Known for Home Alone and Harry Potter) this powerful and riveting movie moves even the hardest of hearts and leaves everyone crying and with a feeling of hope.

2717115,3,B000LXH0AY,"The musical RENT is a film adaptation of a Broadway play. I've recently seen a pretty dang good Chicago production of it. It's got no shortage of heart, lots of energy, and lots of laughs and tears. It's also got some weaknesses that are precariously close to being its death blow. Its flaws don't kill it, but they come close.

The performances are absolutely amazing. I don't have a single critical thing to say about any of the actors.

Musically, I know this music has made the global rounds and it's huge. I don't think there's anything bad to say about the musical score either.

But looking critically at RENT, both as a story and as a film, reveals glaring flaws that keep me personally from falling head-over-heels in love with it and becoming a full-fledged RENT-head. This story has some problems that are both unfortunate and major, paradoxically leaving me with a sense of disingenuousness. Which doesn't make sense considering its origin, where it came from, Larson. I shouldn't be able to call 'BS' on RENT and be justified, and yet I can.

RENT assumes rather than earns its authenticity.

RENT has an unflinching, unapologetic self-centeredness that both serves it and cripples it. It has devoted so much focus and effort into being Gen-X'y, bohemian, and anti-establishment, that it has overlooked having a genuine identity of its own. Its uniqueness is stereotypical. It's confined to its freedom. Its portrayal of village artists and photographers is obvious, clunky, one-dimensional, clich. The film is far too self-congratulatory to even consider noticing this.

RENT is trying (plaintively?) to make its characters' last year on Earth a celebration, but the thing is, I feel like a terrible situation of tremendous gravity, urgency, and despair has been turned into something of a 3-ring circus. On some level I feel like I have to question how seriously this was meant to be taken. Only its origin saves it from being creatively bankrupt. The exact same story coming from any Hollywood writer would rightfully get burned at the stake. Ultimately, these decisions ARE Larson's prerogative. I guess that being homeless and your imminent AIDS-related death doesn't automatically require an uptight documentary-style treatment.

RENT's excessive prettiness is also a big detriment to the film's authenticity, honestly. These people are awfully beautiful to be homeless AIDS victims. These are all designer characters. Their appearance is a deliberate, calculated, manicured image designed to make the idea more digestible. I rather suspect some watch this so they can feel like they've adopted some of the suffering of an underprivileged group of people. Do those individuals spend any actual time with the homeless? Who's to say. This mentality has infected other visual aspects of the film, too. Everything is so manicured and staged it becomes false. Everything is designer and Hollywood and perfect, including--nay, ESPECIALLY the abandoned buildings and alleys. The cinematography is a technical masterpiece and everything happens much too perfectly for me to believe in the world of RENT. It's not to be unexpected in a musical, but the nature of the subject matter changes the game quite a bit. Would I apply that equally to all films everywhere? Unfortunately, we're in the territory of art criticism here and it's subjective--and context matters, so no. For instance, Chicago has all the exact same traits, but they work for the film it instead of against it. And, say, a maverick cop out to kick some butt lacking authenticity is an entirely different ball game than being fake about THIS.

The entire scene with Sarah Silverman is the epitome of what I'm talking about. It fails to be the stark contrast with the rest of the film that it's trying to be. Furthermore, the entire subplot is an absurd non sequitur, but that's beside the point. It's trying to contrast how perfectly neat and tidy this corporate world is with how free and loose the world of the rest of the film is, but the entire film is actually neat and tidy--the spontaneity and freedom are artificial. I don't buy it.

But thanks to the performances, damn, RENT sure does have a fire in its britches.

In a way, it is simultaneously justified and questionable to call this film fakey, as it is just Jonathon Larson's feelings on the subject rendered in musical form. It really has an energy to it, no denying that. It really challenges you to drop your hangups and relax and enjoy the ride.

I'm not a RENT-head, nor do I hate it. I don't think it's mediocre, canned, or kitsch. I don't think it's amazing or enlightening. Calling it pretentious isn't exactly fair, though there is a pretentiousness to it. I do, however, feel confident in saying both that it has flaws and has something to it.

So, how you feel about RENT will always come down to how deeply you connect to the characters and how much you're feeling the music. Is it an electrifying, heartbreaking celebration of life and love, or is it a mockery? Both cases could be made. My bottom line opinion: RENT is successful in spite of itself. The actors work harder than they should have to to sell a story that's working against them, confined by excessively stiff character molds--and they are so good, they pull it off. What's strong is incredibly strong. But to pretend its flaws didn't exist would be, for me, an intellectual suicide.",1203379200,,5401,4.942668136714444

2717130,4,B000LXH0AY,"I have a ""from the beginning,"" perspective of RENT.  In 1995, I moved to New York, because one of my oldest and dearest friends asked me to.  She was there, living in other people's apartments, and wanted a place of her own.  We had lived together in Michigan and had known eachother since about 15 years old.  Once we settled into a studio in Brooklyn, she decided that she didn't want to be in the office of the New York Theatre Workshop, but wanted to Stage Manage Theatre.  Mind you, we were both in our early 20s.
Upon her resignation, she was offered assistant stage manager for a new musical at the workshop:  Rent.  Night after night she would come home and talk about Jonathan, Anthony, et. all.  ""Light My Candle,"" was a song that she often had in her head during rehearsals.  At the time, we had NO IDEA that a phenom was in the making.  As opening night at the NYTW approached, she offered me comps.  No great thrill.  I'd seen some other workshop theatre and was disappointed.  Then Jonathan died.  She came home that night in shock.  The next day was to be the first performance in front of an audience.  It was transformed into a memorial at the theater.  At this point, things drastically started to change.  The memorial turned into a 'performance' half-way through, and she described the experience as a life-altering experience.  Again, still not much hype about the actual show.
Moving on, I took a friend to opening night at the NYTW.  It was packed.  The theatre was shockingly small.  Maybe 300-400 seats.  My guest and I ended up in the aisle, sitting on the steps, about 10 feet from the stage.  The big deal that night was that 80s teen queen Molly Ringwald was in the audience, as a close friend of Larson's.
Well, the show was like NO experience I'd ever encountered.  At intermission, my companion and I smoked outside the theatre in wonder of the talent on stage, the brilliance of the composer and the fact that we were lucky to be counted among the few who would experince this masterpiece.
After the show, we were invited to the cast party.  I'd been to many cast parties in my life and my companion, Jackie and I almost didn't go.  We were young and New York had better things to offer.  However, we agreed.
Next thing I know, I'm at a buffet table, standing next to Molly Ringwald. A few moments later, while eating Swedish Meatballs, one of the actors, as wide eyed as me, grabbed me by the shoulders (not knowing me), and said, ""I'm at a party with MOLLY RINGWALD!!!!).  At the time, I was as excited as he was.  Looking back, I think, ""my God!  Wilson Jermaine Herdia, future Tony winner and film actor, was as star-struck as I was.
Within days, the publicity was overwhelming.  Before I knew it, my roommate mentioned the B word.  Broadway.  Holy S#*t!!!  There was a LOT of red tape in the transmission.  One of the cool aspects was that the cast was really tight.  They wanted absolute equal pay.  They even came together to champion my roommate...just an assistant manager, but a human being that they had grown close to.  She (my roommate) wasn't AT ALL in any unions and was very young.  Eventually, things were ironed out, and my best friend was going to broadway!  (Imagine that from a gal from Michigan living in a studio apartment in Brooklyn with another person, at that young age!)
Between closing night off-broadway and opening night on Broadway, a lot of work was to be done, all without the creator's input.  I remember Cathie taking me to the new Broadway home for RENT at the Niederlander Theatre.  This theater had not been utilized for YEARS.  The day I was there, construction was being done to the stage, the ""house,"" and the lobby.  It was a mess.  We both agreed that a show like RENT deserved to be in such a run-down, shabby theater.
Hype was escalating.  I was getting caught up in it.  Had the actual show not moved and touched me as it did, things might have been different, but i was excited.  It was surreal.  At this point, the hype was really taking off.  Again, I was wrapped up in my own world.  How does one know at the time that you are experiencing History first hand?
Cathie brought home a video tape of the show at the NYTW. She needed to study it for the broadway rehearsals.  At this point, I was in love with the show.  I made an audio tape of the performance.  The audio was recorded through the soundboard, so audience responce was minimal.  I listened to that tape almost every day until the official cast recording was released.  I still have it.  There was even a song that was cut.

Now to the film.  The show moved me beyond any other experience.  I saw it countless times on Broadway.  I am not one of those 'rent-heads' that would stand in line for tickets, so I don't necessarily consider myself the biggest fan of the show.  But I know it well.  The film moved me again, as it did off and on Broadway.  I was thrilled to see most of the cast on screen, as I felt their performances were beyond compare.  The emotion and feel of the film was outstanding.
What I didn't like was the shift of time to the late 80s.  This show IS the 1990s.  Roger's hair was repulsive.  Nothing like the punk/pop spikes he had in the original.  And how can a movie taking place in the 80s mention THELMA AND LOUISE?!?!?  Finally, I hated the opening sequence of Anthony Rapp singing while riding a bike through the 'streets of New York.""  And how could the filmmaker turn ""Take Me or Leave Me,"" into a song at their wedding?!?!
Anyway, view this one with an open heart and you will surly  be moved by the power of the music, story and performances.  It deserved a better chance in movie theaters.",1198800000,,5667,4.441634241245136

In the opera's opening scene, the artists, musicians, and bohemians are torching their scripts, novels, and sheet music for heat because they are poor, desperate, and freezing. Ditto for the denizens of Rent. Update to Manhattan's Lower East Side, pre 9/11, pre gentrification, post AIDS; slight change to drug addict, stripper, musician, film maker, drag queen, performance artist, lesbian lawyer, gay philosophy professor, and yuppie developer, and voila! Rent: a film of a Broadway musical that took Broadway by storm in 1996.

Aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's RENT to Benny Coffin III (Taye Diggs), a former friend, now a yuppie developer with dreams of gentrifying. He had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter, but now is pressuring them to stop a protest of evicting the homeless from a nearby property. Exotic dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson), inexplicably has the hots for Roger, even though he never seems to actually finish writing a song. Mark's former girlfriend, performance diva Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia).

Directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000W74EQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)</a>) who felt that though the Broadway version was 10 years old, a lot of the original cast could still carry their roles. All but two of the film's cast are from the original Broadway cast. Some of the songs are removed to make way for more dialogue, but the songs are still integrated into the movie in a clever way. The Broadway version was sung throughout, like a Rock Opera. In the film they sometimes break into song suddenly, with no warning, as in the scene where Maureen, the performance artist, and Joanne, her new girlfriend, have a commitment ceremony. It highlights her flamboyant personality, and the trouble that Joanne is having dealing with her flirtatiousness. The shock is also palpable on their respective parents, who seem OK with it, but are really pushed to their limits (I like to picture Lynne & Dick Cheney as Maureen's parents).

But mostly the songs develop very naturally, and almost evolve from spoken to sung as the emotions heighten, as in the seductive ""Light My Candle"" sung by Mimi to Roger, or they grow out of actual performances in the context of the action, as in ""Out Tonight"" which begins with Mimi's dance routine. One of the best lines is from ""Candle"" where Roger says she looks familiar, and then Mimi says she is a dancer at the Cat Scratch Club. ""I didn't recognize you without the handcuffs,"" he sings.

The musical was written by Jonathan Larson. Tragically, he died just before his show could be staged, of an aortic aneurysm. In some bonus footage he is shown proclaiming that he wants to write the ""Hair of the `90s."" He also received some support and encouragement from Steven Sondheim.

(Widescreen Edition)</a>, in its attempt to revitalize the Musical form. That movie took familiar songs and recast them as plot stepping stones. RENT can at least claim that original music and lyrics were written specifically for it.

For me, it was interesting to speculate how the film's cast and the people that Jonathan Larson was writing about were related. If their characters were gay, were the actors portraying them also gay? I wondered if Larson pictured himself as Roger, or perhaps more of Mark, the film maker? (Wouldn't it have been great to have Andy Dick in this role, Anthony Rapp's fine performance notwithstanding?) Maybe he most closely identified with Angel? An interesting bit of trivia was that Larson supported himself as a waiter at the Moondance Caf&eacute;, and later, Jesse L. Martin also worked there as a waiter, even being trained under Larson. His character, the philosophy professor Tom Collins, was very gay, and I wondered about him.

I once saw him along with S. Epatha Merkerson, also of L&O, as she picked up an Emmy. Seeing him that night, with Merkerson, and two other seemingly gay men in her entourage, it really seemed like he was. An internet search could not confirm this, except at one point it said he was never married (was married to his career), didn't have a girlfriend--but then one gossip item showed him out on the town with Cynthia Nixon, of Sex & the City.

Also dating someone from Sex & the City is Rosario Dawson. She was electric in RENT, and I saw that she had quite a varied career, from independent films to blockbusters to bombs.

Taye Diggs, along with Jesse L. Martin, was also a love interest on Ally McBeal. He was linked to Ling Woo (Lucy Liu), and he was also not only a cultural reference, but also played Will Truman's love interest on a few episodes of Will & Grace. Jack makes numerous references to Taye Diggs, as in a birthday wish of someone for a hot air baloon ride over Taye Diggs' house, and he is also a prominent feature of the gay assistant's character's fantasies on Ugly Betty. His character in RENT is neither gay, nor particularly appealing as he is kind of the villain--a once idealistic friend who is now a cynical yuppie developer. It is just interesting how he has become such a cultural icon. He is even mentioned several times on Hannah Montana.

What with the interesting cast, music, songs and story of RENT, I would have to say, RENT--no buy it, today!

2717135,2,B000LXH0AY,"First off, I love Rent.  Have the Broadway and German Cast soundtracks, I've seen it on Broadway, and saw the movie several times in the theater.  Great movie.  But the UMD just flat out sucks.  Believe it or not, there is NO CHAPTER SELECT option in the main menu.  Wow.  A musical UMD naturally ought to be separated into chapters that will let you easily go to the track you want to watch/listen, but that's not possible without a chapter selection menu.  Furthermore, the chapters are not bookmarked so that they start at the beginning of a song, which again, would make sense for a musical like Rent.  Video and audio are good, but I would have just made my own MP4 video file if I knew that the UMD would be so lame, especially since Sony now allows video of full 480x272 resolution to be played from memory stick.  Using PSP Video 9, you can make videos that are of comparable quality but only 700mb-1gb in size (AVC video@768kbps, AAC audio@128kbps) that will play off your pro duo memory stick.  And since the PSP now allows you to easily scene search by 1,2, or 5 minute intervals, it is much easier to find the song you want to play on the pro duo than on this UMD.

2717150,2,B000LXH0AY,"I've become a burgeoning Renthead, but I've never seen the musical yet. I listen to the soundtrack constantly. Actually my first experience with Rent was through this movie. I loved the songs and the music, but after seeing pics and some video of the original show, I came to the conclusion that Chris Columbus took Jonathan Larson's inspired work and made it so uninspiring.

His first mistake was to shoot on location or sets that look like New York. When you look at the set design of the musical, it was conceptual and abstract. If the set designers of the musical wanted to copy reality, they would have done that, but they realized that Rent (like many musicals) is a fable. Therefore the stylized abstract set works with the rock musical genre. The look of the movie is based on reality (they are singing in the streets and dancing in cafes). And because of that, it looks like every other musical or rock video set in New York. And other musicals, like West Side Story, do it so much better. And this is a shame because Rent was so fresh and different and this movie makes it seem so ordinary.

I'm not a filmmaker, but I think it would have been very interesting to shoot this musical with all of the actors against a bluescreen and then add a GCI conceptual stylized version of New York in the background. That way the environment of New York could look fresh and different, just like it did in the original musical.

Another aspect of the film that is so dissapointing is it's failure to carry the same emotional weight of the musical. Take for instance the scene when the cast is walking away from the funeral and begin arguing. This is one of the most emotionally charged scenes in the musical, the breakdown of this family of friends that we've come to love. How does Columbus handle this? He shows us a far establising shot with the friends walking through a cemetary. You can barely see their faces! And then he edits out the arguement/duet between Mark and Roger which was the conclusion of that emotional arc in the musical. Just like his two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus does not know how to bring out the emotional arc of a storyline.

The best part of this DVD was the No Day But Today documentary on the 2nd disc which tells the story of Larson and Rent. That was much more interesting and inspiring than the movie. And it is a shame because this was/is an innovative unique musical. There was nothing like it that came before and there has been nothing like it since, and this movie makes it seem so pedestrian.",1192838400,,2541,4.505422993492408
2717151,1,B000LXH0AY,"I had such high expectations for this film. I heard many great things about this musical. Struggling actors trying to make their dreams come true and who are trying to find love. Well, I must have picked up the wrong DVD.
They complain that their landlord is going to kick them out because they haven't paid their rent in 1 yr. Let's feel sorry for the leaches of society.
A strung out 19 yr old stripper with a heroin addiction & AIDS tries to seduce her neighbor. While attempting to get this guy into bed, she neglects to mention her deadly diagnosis, not knowing that he has it as well. She was willing to put someone else's life in danger so that she could satisfy her own needs. So typical of a drug addict.
These characters seemed to look at being a success in life as failure. They needed to be failures to feel ok about things. When one of them tried to do something that was successful, they seemed to feel guilty about leaving the others behind. They'd ditch their reality to live in a rat infested apartment without heat, lights, or food.
Five of the main characters had AIDS and every single one of them lead risky lifestyles. Then were totally and completely shocked when diagnosed.
They could have really done something meaningful with this film. I was truly disappointed with the message this movie was sending out. Life can be tough, but it doesn't make it any easier when a compromised person is buying drugs, shooting up, stripping, ripping off ATM machines, and then complaining that the world owed them.

2717152,5,B000LXH0AY,"This review specifically concerns the 2 disc special edition which is one of, if not the best dvd's I have yet to see produced for the money!!!

Yes...I liked the Broadway show the three times I saw it,but I LOVED the movie. Yes, there were alterations, as there always are, when a stage show hits the big screen. I happened to be one of the viewers who thought that the movie took the live show to another height under the direction of Chris Columbus. What is EXCEPTIONAL is disc 2 of this dvd which features an amazing two hour documentary about the development of RENT and it's composer Jonathan Larson. You will learn about Larson and his incredible journey to turn musical theatre around for the MTV Generation. Also,the characters for RENT are based out of his real life struggle as an artist and the lives of his friends. Though Puccini's LA BOHEME gives RENT it's foundation,it is Larson's life and friends that give RENT it's substance. It contains fascinating and heartfelt interviews with the original cast,family,producers and friends. You will learn about the development of RENT from it's earliest inception up to and through the making of the film. Your viewing of the film will be that much richer after seeing this wonderfully produced and insightful documentary...ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE.It is every bit as compelling as the movie itself. Not often is there such an amount of material for the money.",1189123200,,1415,4.871369294605809

2717154,5,B000LXH0AY,"Rent is a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning musical made into a movie.  The story follows the life of a group of Bohemians for one year in New York City from 1989-1990.  Mark Cohen is a filmmaker as well as the narrator who shares an apartment with his friend, Roger Davis, a striving musician whom is HIV-positive.  Tom Collins is Mark and Roger's former roommate, who lost his job at MIT and is HIV-positive.  Tom's lover, HIV-positive Angel, is a drag queen that holds the group together.  Maureen Johnson is Mark's ex-girlfriend turned lesbian, whose girlfriend is lawyer, Joanne Jefferson.  Lastly, Mimi Marquez is Roger's new girlfriend who works at the Cat Scratch Club, is a drug addict, and HIV-positive.  The group of friends have a hard time finding work, and without money they cannot pay their rent.  Throughout the movie, it is slowly understood who does and does not have HIV.

The composer, Jonathan Larson, was born in Mount Vernon, New York and attended Adelphi University on a full scholarship.  After graduation he spent 12 years composing music for plays, and in 1994 he started to compose Rent.  On the night of the last dress rehearsal for Rent, Jon died of Marfan's syndrome, a connective tissue disease.

The movie beautifully displays the strength of the friendships between the characters.  They support each other unconditionally, whether attending life support meetings or helping another in work emergencies.  There is a strong bond between those with HIV and those without, and they freely offer their time when one is sick.  Angel is a strong, independent woman; she simply does not care about others' opinions and is the glue that keeps the group together.  Eventually, the relationships disintegrate, and everyone goes their separate way.  Two months later they all reconnect when one of the former friends encounters a tragic event.  The music is compelling and enhances the storyline.  Each character has his/her own style of sound when they sing, which is a reflection of his/her personality.  Roger is the rocker, so when he is singing there is a harder drum beat and guitar sound, displaying his stubbornness and determination to succeed in the music industry.  When Mimi sings, it is more passionate and soft with more focus on the piano, reflecting her innocence, and inexperience with life.  The majority of the characters in the movie reprise their roles from the Broadway production.

The only criticism about the movie is after the first viewing it is difficult to have the same emotional reaction to the story.  Secondary viewings allow the audience to pick up on new concepts originally overlooked.

This movie is suitable for those 15 and older due to the selling and use of drugs as well as the HIV storyline.  The character dynamics and friendships in Rent are similar to the types of friendships in Hairspray and High School Musical I and II.",1188691200,,2897,4.95850622406639

2717174,5,B000LXH0AY,"It was obvious after ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" that the genre of movie musical was experiencing a renaissance of some kind. This paved the way for many projects to arrive from Broadway to the big screen, but there is always one significant problem - who is the target audience? More so, are the consumer generations of the 21st century ready to buy in to singing and dancing when telling a story? God forbid a movie doesn't have a plot or a point; it is automatically labeled with the words ""tedious"", ""boring"" and the pejorative ""artistic"".

So, here comes ""RENT"". It is exactly a musical studios would be frightened to invest in. The very slim plot is simply an excuse to present a generation of artists, some of them gay, lesbian or transgendered, and their bohemian lifestyle. As they fight AIDS, hold protests and revolutionize against selling out, you are expected to believe that they simply often burst into song when you least expect it and don't give a damn that the things they talk about may be considered controversial, sinful or wrong (especially since they perform these songs boldly, unlike the very stylized approaches of ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""Chicago""). I am glad to say that, despite all this, the movie miraculously works on its every level.

The characters of ""RENT"" are based on real people and their experiences in the impoverished East Village, New York City. Among them is Roger, an HIV-infected ex-junkie musician who is liked by Mimi, a 19-year-old stripper junkie. Roger shares his flat with Mark, who is a film-maker looking for the way ""to express, to communicate"" which becomes particularly hard when his girlfriend Maureen dumps him for another girl, the wealthy Joanne. Add in a philosophy teacher who can't find meaning in life until he meets Angel, a man in drag, and you have a huge spectrum of characters, which can sometimes present an obstacle in some movies. The strength of ""RENT"" is that it treats all these characters as one, combining their different characteristics into one sample of the New York Bohemia.

Another fantastic aspect of the musical is its music - literally every number is a showstopper, from the emotional ""Seasons of Love"" and ""I'll Cover You"" to the rockin' ""Rent"" and ""What You Own"". ""La Vie Boheme"" is a challenge of a song, since it contains more than twenty references, and it is fun to research them and trace the influences these people grew up with - Maya Angelou, The Sex Pistols, Michael Cunningham, just to name a few. Another fun sequence is ""Out Tonight"" which celebrates being young and having fun, but then subtly fades into ""Another Day"", which explains the philosophy of living in the moment and enjoying every day like it's the last.

""RENT"" never fails. Despite some slight misjudgments and some slower pace at times, it is always strong, bold and delivers its message. It is also never pretentious, because even if you have never lived this kind of life, it is inviting and seductive. More than anything, ""RENT"" is playful, and that is its sexiness - recognizing and understanding the philosophy of ""no day but today"".",1180051200,,3101,4.856332703213611

(Angel grabbed my heart from the start with his/her incredibly beautiful face and huge talent.) Some of the music is good.

On the down side, from my perspective, it seemed fake.  True, it's just a musical and we're not supposed to really ""believe"" in them.  But as one who actually lived in ""Alphabet City"" I expected something more real.  It was fake blood, fake drugs, fake tragedy, fake ideals. Lots of enthusiasm and intense singing but...somehow it just left me luke-warm.

I'm reminded of the one Broadway musical I did make it to in my East Village days---HAIR.  Set during the Viet Nam war, it seemed far more real to me.  This is a pale grandchild of that wonderful show, which was made into an equally wonderful film....same elements...a group of beautiful counter-culture 20-ish kids, with the obligatory mix of races and sexual orientation, colorfully protesting against everything their parents stood for....But HAIR was the original and it was magic.

It was very obvious that I was supposed to love the characters.  It was a complete mystery WHY I was supposed to love the characters.  Mark won't talk to his parents and, along with his roommate, lives in a HUGE studio apartment in NY that he hasn't paid rent on in a year(!).  He quits the one job he obtains because he has to work on ""his"" film.  After one year has elapsed, ""his"" film is a ~5 minute clip of his friends.  I could do that in two weeks while holding a full-time job.  Yet, he is one of the ""good guys"", whereas the friend who actually GOT a job and is trying to collect the rent (due for a year, remember) is evil.  Huh?

Most of the characters have something about them that could, under the right circumstances, elicit sympathy (AIDS, drug addictions, etc.).  However, the stories behind them are never told; futhermore, the charcters generally celebrate the very lifestyle choices that got them into the unfortunate circumstances, becoming EXTREMELY self-righteous and preachy in the process.  About halfway through the movie, I gave up on enjoying it, though I did continue watching.  I just never felt anything like I was supposed to feel.",1171584000,,1430,4.668

The movie, however, left me cold. What bugged me most is the Hollywood schmaltz laid thick all over what is purpotedly the late 80s' NY. What was a gritty, sick, and extremely creative scene has been transformed out into cutesy entertainment. In this Starbucks version of late 80s East Village, junkies and AIDS sufferers feature cool clothes, perfect bodies, clear skin, and neat haircuts. Their suffering is largely outside the camera shot. Not only the whole farce felt cheap, it seemed to cheapen the experience of those who lived, died, and created on that scene.",1170028800,,816,4.870503597122302

If people haven't seen the stage version or the movies, I highly recommend that you see either one but if you see Broadway then make sure you get the soundtrack for the marvelous music or just buy the dvd and you can watch over and over.

2717212,5,B000LXH0AY,"Just finished watching the DVD, my first time seeing RENT in any form. The line ""525,600 minutes"" is dancing through my head and won't go away. I'm kind of at a loss as to where to start saying what I want to say. I guess the highest praise I can give it is, this is the best contemporary musical I've seen in YEARS.

My first introduction to RENT was by way of--of all things--Late Night with David Letterman, when he had the original cast on the show to perform (I think) ""La Vie Boheme."" I remember the energetic singing, the vivacious dancing on the table, the THUNDEROUS applause they received at song's end...and thinking, ""Man, this is one musical I have to see."" I'm just sorry it took me this long to finally see it, considering it's been to Kansas City with touring companies a few times. Now that I've seen the movie and loved it, I can only hope it comes here again, and soon.

All this being said, I can only agree with the multitudes who've already reviewed RENT. The cast is outstanding. The songs--of which I loved every one--just knocked me out. (The rock songs almost sound like Springsteen could have written them, they're THAT good.) There are moments in the movie when you'll want to stand up and cheer, and moments that will bring tears to your eyes. I can't recommend this highly enough...IMHO, it runs rings around musicals like Chorus Line, Cats, or Chicago. If you haven't seen it yet, treat yourself and do so ASAP. In fact, why wait?--no day like today.",1169337600,,1481,4.522388059701493

That was something striking about the film and I don't know why I picked that up.  I could identify with every single character.  You have to watch it with an open mind.  The other unexpected outcome of RENT:  I have an AUTISTIC 2 year old that will sit and watch the ENTIRE film.  The first time we put the movie on, he stopped spinning a toy he had been playing with and walked right up to the TV.  He sits in the bean bag to watch it.  He actually tries to dance when ANGEL dances.  He's interacting.  This is a huge milestone for someone who is autistic.

I'm now sorry I waited, despite knowing the general story I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. The songs were upbeat and not too long (in general I dislike musicals) and the story was very well put together and the acting exceptional, in my opinion. Friends trying to figure out their lives and accept each other, warts and all, find that shared experience and hardship can form a bond akin to family. While the premise of low-rent was central to the story, anyone who lives in new york knows that the apartments these struggling artist have in the movie are ridiculous. That aside, it was stylized a bit much, but that seems to be usual with musicals. This movie was so watchable it was almost mesmerizing, and even a bit touching at times. If you like musicals, stories about artists, believe in bohemian ideals, see the world as us against them, or even just enjoy a good story of ""we're all just people"", you will probably enjoy this movie.

2717228,5,B000LXH0AY,"I must say, when I rented this dvd from Blockbuster, I expected to be thoroughly disappointed by a sappy, watered-down version of one of the most powerful and moving Broadway musicals of all time.  I was, however, shocked by Chris Columbus's sensitive and accurate interpretation of the show.  There are very few changes made from the original libretto.  In fact, I watched the film, while following along with my liner notes from the original cast recording, and found almost no deviation, down to a parenthetical stage direction in the notes stating that Roger puts on his jacket and leaves the building, which occured simultaneously with the same scene in the movie. The few cuts, which are well-planned and smoothly executed, include the unfortunate, but understandable absence of the song ""Contact"".  Instead, the scenic montage of Angel's declining health takes some getting used to, but in the end, does more justice to the effects of the disease in reality.  Rosario Dawson, while slightly unbelievable as a heroin addict, gives a much more enjoyable musical performance than Daphne Rubin-Vega, in my humble, professional opinion.  Tracie Thoms turns in a comparable performance to Fredi Walker, though her melismatic contribution to ""Seasons of Love"" culminates with a pleasant high C, as opposed to the high D performed by Walker.

On the flip side, the extra features make this set well worth the purchase.  There are a plethora of documentaries from the making of the show and the movie, to the biography of composer Jonathan Larson.  The information is both fascinating and inspiring.

I could go into more detail, but I found the reviewer below to be quite accurate, and overall, this is definitely a worthwhile experience, both for rentheads and newbies alike.  I was surprised and thrilled by the quality of the production, and the degree to which it held true to the show.  It is a brilliant film, to be sure.",1167436800,,1926,5.022012578616352

2717231,4,B000LXH0AY,"So what's the story?

This is a musical (or ""rock opera"" to use the correct technical term) set in New York City about a group of East Village young people caught up between their grasping landlord on the one hand, and poverty, illness and pre-combination therapy AIDS on the other. It's based on Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical, apparently one of the longest running shows on Broadway.

Sounds all doom and gloom. Does it work as a musical?

Rock opera, rock opera. And yes. This movie is all about celebrating life and all the possibilities it offers. It's about fighting for success and acceptance. The realities of illness and death are acknowledged but this is no mournful tale.

But still. A rock opera? You?

(Laugh) Yes, it's true I've never been one for musicals - or, shall we say, movies with singing and dancing in them. ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Fame"" are about all I can handle. I hated ""Grease"", I fell asleep ten minutes into ""West Side Story"", ""Evita"" went completely over my head and ""Moulin Rouge"" just gave me a headache. But I was determined to watch this one and I was determined to own a copy on DVD, primarily because of the issues it deals with. But there was also the fact that I'd heard the wonderful Jesse L. Martin was in it. I'm a huge fan and I'd only ever seen him on TV - first of all in that silly Ally McBeal's love interest and more recently as Detective Eddie Green on ""Law & Order"". The prospect of seeing him singing and dancing (which he does in this movie, and very well, it has to be said), to me was worth the price of the DVD all on its own. He was acting a gay character too, which only added to my excitement but there were no love scenes, sadly. There was kissing though...

But, seriously and all superficial stuff aside, this is a great spectacle of drama, song and dance. Jesse L. Martin is not the only star here of course and he is supported (in my eyes anyway) by a great cast, including the ever-beautiful Rosario Dawson, ever-handsome (but always one dimensional) Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp and Tracie Thomas. Everyone gave great performances and you just HAVE to see the diner scene!

But is it something that will stand up to repeated watching?

I think so. For me anyway. On one of those days (which always come around) when I'm feeling low and need some life affirmation, I can think of no better DVD to put on. I'm glad I bought it.

What about DVD Extras?

Well, this 2-disc special edition has loads of extras, including commentary by director Chris Columbus and selected cast, a feature-length documentary called ""No Day But Today"", deleted scenes and musical performances and PSAs for Jonathan Larson's Performing Arts Foundation and the National Marfan Foundation.

So well worth getting then?

Absolutely. The only reason I didn't give it a five star recommendation is that I didn't really like that many of the songs. But for something to watch and get into, I think it's great. Well worth a look.",1165017600,,3040,4.588560885608856

2717233,4,B000LXH0AY,"Just a quick note everyone. I enjoy the movie. They synopsis that other reviewers have posted are very accurate. However, there is one thing that everyone complains about, and that is the fact that alot of the dialogue is set to music. It's SUPPOSED to be that way. Rent is NOT a musical. In a musical, such as The Sound of Music, the songs are cute little ditties that repeat upon themselves and don't serve to move the plot along. In an opera, the lyrics of the songs are meant to be dialogue. I know what you're thinking. ""But, Rent isn't an opera! Where's the fat lady that can break glass with her voice?"" A valid point. But Rent is different. It is a ROCK opera. Whether Jonathan Larsen made that term up himself (yes, he used that term to describe Rent) or it was around before his time, I don't know, but my point it that the lyrics are supposed to function as dialogue. Don't let that throw you off. The music is beautful, and the opening chords of 'Seasons of Love' choke me up every time I hear or play it. Rent is one of my favorite movies, and is well worth the money spent to own it.

2717234,2,B000LXH0AY,"In terms of both format and style - and despite its superficially modernist tendencies - ""Rent"" has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like ""Phantom of the Opera,"" which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like ""Rent,"" which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers ""Rent"" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, ""Rent"" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.

The story, a modern day update of ""La Boheme"" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990.  This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story).  There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them ""deadbeats"") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.

""Rent"" - with its noble ""performance artists"" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the `80's than one from the `60's.  Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as nave, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical ""Angel"") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man).  Anything`s better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America.  When one of the men finally takes a dreaded ""job"" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck.  I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.

With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing.  In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching.  Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.

As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling.  One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of ""the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation"" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music.  It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.

There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture.  In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.

I don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for ""Rent"" (or of its many devoted followers), but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially ""sensitive"" artists - should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free.",1163980800,,5153,4.82633371169126

They each have their own unique style and their voices are remarkable.

I am happy to have the deleted scenes as a bonus in the DVD.  I wish that Chris had kept ""Goodbye Love"" in the film, but thank god we have a chance to see it. It is a scene that has to be seen by all!

Based loosely on Puccini's La Boh&egrave;me, Rent is a rock opera that focuses on the year in the life of a group of friends in New York's East Village who live lives full of art, music, sex, and drugs. The show particularly spotlights the AIDS crisis and how it affects the characters. For the most part, the show made the stage to screen transition well. There were a few awkward moments with characters basically looking at each other and singing - moments that didn't seem to be supported by any subtextual motivations. And the film did allow for flashbacks and other backstory devices that aren't possible on stage. I'm aware that most of the cast members were plucked from the Broadway cast, and they were all really strong. Rosario Dawson, who was new to the effort, did a wonderful job as well.

For the most part, I thought this film was a good treatment of the stage show. The director clearly has a great love for the material, and I also got the feeling that the performers really understood the thematic message of the show. The movie (and the stage play) does contain some sensitive material, but nothing that couldn't inspire productive discussion.

2717238,3,B000LXH0AY,"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ***

I have to admit that, before I saw this movie, I was expecting something much worse than what the movie actually turned out to be. My expectations had been built from reading plot summaries and hearing one or two of the songs plus the lyrics from a few of the others. However, I decided to give the movie a fair chance, as I've been wrong in my expectations before. In the case of Rent, I won't say I was wrong or right. I was kind of half-right in my expectations.

The movie isn't bad, but it is corny, pretentious, pseudo-philosophical, and schmaltzy. It's been said before, but these characters don't come across as people of passion and strong beliefs. They rather come across as excessively idealistic losers who are upset because society makes them do something worthwhile to earn their keep instead of shooting videos of their friends hanging out or spending years writing a single trite song.

Their former friend and now successful businessman is considered a sell-out, though it's not clear what principles he's compromised for money, other than the principle of freeloading. Don't get me wrong - there's plenty wrong with being power-hungry and casting aside people for the sake of profit, but this story hardly captures any of the things that are actually wrong with it.

Along these lines lie pseudo-philosophical statements like ""We're not gonna pay rent, 'cause everything is rent."" I still don't know what that is actually supposed to mean. The best explanation I've heard so far is that it's referring to the fact that you have to pay lots of bills and all that, but if that's what it was intended to mean, it's an incredibly vapid point.

On the subject of the movie's emotional impact, it sounds horrible, but the truth is I was *laughing* during Angel's funeral, and it's not because I found anything particularly funny about Angel's death. That scene could have been one that was actually moving, but instead they started singing ""525,600 minutes"", and the scene suddenly became nothing but corny schmaltz. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with moments like these.

The ending is sad. I don't mean emotionally sad. I mean pathetic sad. Rent tries to tug at heartstrings but then it goes back on its ending as if they were afraid to have a depressing, grim ending and wanted to try *really* hard to have an uplifting ending.

In the end, most of the problems come down to the movie simply trying too hard to be emotionally substantive but being afraid that it won't be uplifting while glorifying a lifestyle that is ultimately unworkable.",1160438400,,2600,4.829213483146067
2717239,5,B000LXH0AY,"I absolutely love this film. It is one of the best ever. I have been dying to see it on Broadway, but haven't been able to. It's so hard to anyways with Broadway being so expensive. But the film is amazing.

The original cast of the broadway show - save for two - are in this film and it's great. I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film.

It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things. I think that there is a ""RENT"" character for everyone!

2717241,5,B000LXH0AY,"I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.

Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so ""out there"" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.

You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of ""I'll Cover You"", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.

Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material.",1156982400,,2699,4.470588235294118

2717244,1,B000LXH0AY,"Jonathan Larson was an incredible talent, as is evident in the stirring melodies he presented to us in ""Rent.""  However, this late-1980's tale of struggling Bohemians is ultimately unsatisfying.  Though a number of the characters must face grave difficulties, including addiction and AIDS, it is hard to feel for the ""struggle"" of those who are provided free residence and spend much of their time living irresponsibly.  The turnabout of now having to owe and entire year's rent is startling, but, on the other hand, I know very few people who have the luxury of living for free, or then simply deciding they will continue to live for free if the rules suddenly change.  On top of this, more than a couple of comments suggest that life in New York can't possibly get more ""sh***y"" than ""today"" (late 1980's), and it makes one wonder what our characters would have thought of a city being attacked by terrorists, destroying the World Trade Center and killing 3,000 people.  With so much suffering going on in the world, it is hard to feel sorry for a group of Bohemians whose main concern is seeking some kind of fellowship as they lead a reckless (and often dangerous) lifestyle with no moral restrictions.

Time is indeed precious, and I appreciate Jonathan Larson's astonishing musical talent, but I would have preferred to spend these two hours with another set of characters.  I have better things to do with my own 525,600 minutes.",1156377600,,1436,4.836734693877551

2717257,1,B000LXH0AY,"* Firstly , I'd like to state for the record, that I originally rated this item , 3 stars. Once I finished my review , I noticed that it was rated a 1 star. Unfortunately I couldn't change it. Now , for my review. Considering the great "" bumps"" in the road , about filming a broadway play ( especially a musical ), I think Chris Columbus's film production of "" Rent"", is a remarkable achievement. From translating the meduim to film , and editing what should stay in and out of the finalized product , is pure genius. Is there a cionsiderable difference in the play and the film ....YES. Will there be any missing momentum and energy lost in the play's transition from stage to film ?......YES. However , ""Rent"" , as a film , stands on it's own merits and highlights enough of the characters and storyline , to give you the jist of the phenominal play. You'll never get out of a film , what you get out of a play. Never ! However , much like the fantastic musicals such as "" Fame , Grease , Hair , and Little Shop of Horrors "" , the success ,of this ""transferring of mediums"" is dependent upon teh storyteller ( aka: the director). Chris Columbus does a fantastic job. Enough of my technical talk. The story itself , is a mezmerizing and unforgettable journey into the lives of several friends caught up in the bohemian lifestyle.  The story takes place in 1980's NY , and thusly the problems such as poverty , homelessness , drug use , and AIDS, play a huge factor. Ironically , the plot hasn't aged muich , because we're still living in that era. The only difference is that some of us are older and wiser. However , the problems still plaugue our society and this film does brilliantly at highlighting these issues. The film features phenominal performances , musical numbers , editing , directing , and cinematography. There is also a bonus dvd , that takes us to the humble ( to say the least ) beginnings, of the development of "" Rent"". This bonus dvd , is well worth the purchase price. Another mentionable and commendable aspect of "" Rent' , is that it features the majority of the original broadway cast. After viewing the bonus dvd , it is impossible to cast the film any other way. The actors burst back into their characters , like a teenager rides a bike. They simply perform better than anyone else ever could. Plain and simple , this movie is tight. I highly recommend it , even if you don't like musicals. I believe that you will find yourself watching it again and again and even humming some of the songs. Whereas , "" Rent "",  might not be the best musical I've ever seen, it certainly is one that I will never forget. Where it lacks in song originality , it makes up for , in script. Where is lacks in acting , it makes up for , in character development. Just open your mind and your heart and measure your life in Love.",1154476800,,2839,4.334586466165414
2717258,5,B000LXH0AY,"I didn't know much about Rent except it was a popular Broadway musical that seemed in my mind like Gen X's Hair.

This was simultaneously uplifting and sad. I cried during Angel's funeral. I've worked with people with AIDS in the past because of my job at the time. I've known people who died of it. I can't imagine anyone who hasn't in one way or another been touched by this horrible disease. Being in my 20s in the peak years when it was big in the news, this brought back so many memories.

In general, I don't like musicals. But this to me was excellent. This is for anyone with an open mind and open heart.",1154476800,,612,4.222222222222222

2717260,2,B000LXH0AY,"I really wanted to like this film. When learning that Chris Columbus was going to direct the play, I knew inherently the movie could not be as good as the play. The movie was unimaginative, boring, and forced. And while I liked the idea of casting the original members, they seemed too old for the parts, and even their voices seemed aged as compared to the original cast recording. Their voices lacked that youthful spunk.  To equate AIDS, homosexuality, and drug addiction with Bohemian life is nonsense. These people had no art, no talent, no intellect.

As a rock opera I think everything should have been sung like the play. Turning it into dialog made it laughable. And what is up with the side commitment ceremony scene between Joann and Maureen? That was just plain crap. I will say though that the message was there and anyone who sees the movie will come away with the message of peace and love no matter who you are or your situation. But as far as artistic value, it lacked depth and I only have the writer and director to blame.",1154390400,,1041,4.531914893617022
2717261,1,B000LXH0AY,"I'm never sure how to view film adaptations of plays, books, television shows, etc. Does one view it as a film? As an adaptation of the play to film? How faithful the transition is from stage to film? I have not seen the play performed in any capacity so perhaps that is a blessing and a curse. A cures because I have nothing to compare the movie to. A blessing because if the play is in anyway similar to the movie, I will stay as far away from it as possible.

The film focuses on a group of faux-Bohemians living in the Alphabet City region of New York City, in a large, run down loft, refusing to pay the rent. The owner of the buildings want to tear them down and build a 'virtual reality loft', or something to that extent. What that is exactly is never really explained.

Perhaps it is my experience in property management that has biased me, but for me, it was easy to see why the owner wished to do so. The buildings are hemmoreging money, tenets are refusing to pay, the places are is so much disrepair, that it would be ludicrous to attempt to do so. Eviction, sadly, is a truth of the world, and more often than not, ample time (at least in California) is given to tenants.

Perhaps the film suffers too much from the boring hand of Chris Columbus. Several plot lines are weaved through, none of which are given any time to really come to fruitarian. Are we to focus on Mimis and Rogers budding relationship? The AIDS infected lovers? The biracial lesbian lovers with the rocky relationship? The aspiring film maker there to show the *true* New York? We never know. I assume that we are to feel to most of Angels death, but his time on screen is so short, his funeral comes off as flat and as unnecessary as the character himself.

Oddly enough, the best scene in the movie, for me at least, was the scene that seemed to run completely counter to the films theme. While filming a homeless women being moved by police, Mark says to the officers ""Smile for Ted Kopple, officers"". It is not the police that push him away, but the homeless women. ""I don't need your help, artist"" she says. ""This city if full of artist. You want to help me? You got a dollar?"" Sullen, and looking away, she continues on, ""Yeah, I thought so"". In a film that tries to romanticizes poverty and demise in a region of the city that is the American Calcutta, that scene cuts sharply.

Save your money. Luckily, I had free tickets, so I paid nothing, but in a theater that had a dozen people or so, its not a good sign when you see at least four walk out.",1154304000,,2540,4.305439330543933
2717262,4,B000LXH0AY,"I am a self-proclaimed lover of musical theatre. And although I own  almost every major Broadway and Off-Broadway soundtrack, and have seen most of the classics at least once or twice, I somehow let Rent slip through the cracks. Not, by any means, because I never heard of it, but, rather, because I made the all too often fatal mistake of listening to the musical theatre elitists who turn their nose up at anything that wasn't written by Stephen Sondheim. Sure, I heard the story: an update of La Boehme that replaces Mimi with a stripper and the plague with AIDS. I also heard of the untimely death of the young composer, and even bought into the urban legend that he died of AIDS (which could not be further from the truth). But, somehow, I took a pass on the show, the soundtrack, and the whole sordid affair. The ""rentheads"" just seemed far too giddy for me to believe that they were actually worshipping something of value. Boy was I wrong.

When the movie came out, I was tempted to go see it, but I took yet another pass, for all the same reasons. But the DVD was convenient enough for me to give it a spin. And what a spin it was. As a piece of musical theatre, Rent is not without its issues - all of which have been stated very eloquently before. The plot is a little weak and the lyrics could have used a little refining. But THE MUSIC! Oh, that music! I was bowled over from the first half minute. Jonathan Larson was far from a musical genius - which is exactly why the music is so incredibly good. Combining simple, memorable melodies with incredible multi-part harmonies, the notes sing to you all by themselves. I was left wondering where this play had been all my life.

But this is not intended to be a review of the show itself. What I am here to do today is review the DVD. And I made you sit through the long introduction above because it is very relevant to what I am about to write.  Like most any other operatic musical, it is very hard to translate to film without it feelng like you are watching a studio version of the play itself. The magic of the theatre is lost on film, and most musicals are very difficult to adapt without a whopping serving of cheese. Jesus Christ Superstar, Godspell, Hair, Evita, Phantom Of The Opera, and a slew of others have all suffered from the same fate. And, I'm afraid to say that Rent joins the pack of musicals that just didn't quite translate. Many an ambitious Director have tried. And the only one who has ever succeded, in my opinion, is Rob Marshall with Chicago. How? By filming it like an old style Hollywood musical with an updated modern feel, instead of trying to set the stage version to film. Chris Columbus, who directed Rent, chose to go the other route - adapting the stage show to a series of elaborate sets and unimaginable backgrounds which try to imitate reality, and might have suceeded were it not for all of the frolicking and singing going on. And that's where the conflict lies. Modern Hollywood movies show unrealistic things happening in realistic settings. Stage musicals show realistic things happening in unrealistic settings. So the only way to translate them properly is to do as Chicago did and as the old-style Hollywood musicals did; don't try to be too real. Well, Chris Columbus, with his roots in 1980's New York City, missed that entire point and tried too hard to make it all real for us. And, in so doing, he, in my opinion, failed.

But that's not the only way in which Mr. Columbus failed us. In watching the movie, I had a unique perspective because I had absolutely no previous exposure to the story. And, unfortunately, were it not for the music, I might never have felt any emotion at all because the movie never gives us any emotional attachment to any of the characters. I won't go into plot lines here, but I can tell you that nothing held together. The relationships were just never established. And then I watched the excellent Special Features disc which included all of the cut scenes. And, all of a sudden, everything came together. After watching only 4 of the deleted scenes, I was suddenly able to feel the entire movie. Mark explains his internal struggles, Mimi explains her attachment to Roger, Roger and Mark explain their attachment to one another, and Benny explains his relationship with Mimi. And, with that, you can suddenly understand and relate to the rest of the movie in an entirely different way. Then I made the mistake of turning the Director commentary on during those cut scenes, and I was all the more infuriated to listen in on Chris Columbus flip-flopping back and forth as to whether or not the scenes actually should have been cut. It was like listening to a child trying to justify himself into a position which he knew he should never have taken. This was most evident during his description of the alternate ending in which the actors return to the same stage on which they began, to sing the finale in the same setting where they sang the introduction. This was the only 'theatrical' moment of the entire movie where he actually put the actors on stage where they belong. Tying the ending to the beginning in this way might just have made everything else seem like somebody else's re-telling of their story, or as a part of Mark's film - which could have actually worked. But, instead he decided to cut it because, as he put it, it was too far the beginning and he didn't think the audience would remember it enough to tie the two together. Never underestimate us, Chris. It all left me a little angry, to tell you the truth. But I was also left feeling fortunate to have seen this movie for the first time on DVD so that I could also see these cut scenes and benefit from the composer's original vision - one which made much more sense than that of Chris Columbus.

So it may sound like I'm bashing the Director here, and, in reality, I'm probably not cutting him enough slack. Because I think his intentions were probably good. The problem, as far as I could see it, is that he knew the story too well. So it held together far better for him than for someone like me who had never seen or heard the story before. But there was also a lot that he did right. The decision to use 6 out of 8 of the original cast members, for one. The chemistry, vocal chops, and dramatic timing of Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, and Jesse L. Martin are spectacular and work perfectly together. And the seemless introductions of Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms are equally impressive. The music and accompanying arrangements sound modern, fresh, and well produced, and the blocking, camera work, and timing are all beyond compare. So, although he got a lot of it wrong, he does deserve due credit for getting a lot of things very, very right.

But the real star of this show is still the Special Features disc and, more appropriately stated, the composer, Jonathan Larson. The accompanying cut scenes are a necessity so I won't give the DVD too much credit for including them, but the 2-hour documentary entitled No Day But Today is a gem that could have demanded the entire price of the DVD all by itself. In it, we learn about the life of Jonathan Larson, the humble, eccentric, and, yes, very straight composer of Rent. Not that being straight is relevant to anything other than the fact that there is an eerie and unsettling feeling associated with a person, like myself, who assumed for 10 years that the composer of a play about AIDS must have been homosexual, and then one day, suddenly realizes that my otherwise open mind could have been so easily closed by prejudice and lies. A humbling experience to say the least. In any case, Jonathan Larson's story is told with such eloquence and such feeling that it is even more emotionally insightful than the movie itself. In fact, it was only after watching this documentary that I was truly hooked on the story of Rent. And it is then that you realize that Jonathan Larson's story is as much a part of the success of Rent as the story of the play itself. And maybe it is only through his death that the true story can completely unfold and be felt. This documentary reached me on many levels. It left me speechless. And, as you can tell by the length of this review, that is a rare occurence.

So, in short, I was inspired by Rent - but as much, if not more, by the story of its composer than by the story itself. They are truly one. I am grateful for having been so grossly misinformed and for not having seen Rent before, because I truly believe that the only way I would have truly enjoyed it is not as a 3-hour play, or as a 2-hour movie, but as a 4-hour movie/documentary that paints the entire picture. And it is a picture that I will not soon forget.

Summary: 5-stars for the music, 4-stars for the book, 3-stars for the lyrics, 3-stars for the movie, 6-stars for the documentary. That averages out to about 4-stars. So that's where I'll leave it. But only with these words: Buy this DVD, watch both discs in their entirety, and just let the music and the story reach you as they did me. The feeling will be with you for a long time.",1152316800,,9172,4.487425149700599

2717266,5,B000LXH0AY,"My family loves musicals. I have seen several, but I have yet to see this one on broadway. My grandmother is probably the reason for that, or my mother. One of them did not find the broadway show too good or interesting. So when I went to see this movie, I was a little iffy.

Right away in the movie you are thrown into ""SEASONS OF LOVE,"" which was the class above mine's graduation song and then ""RENT"" the song. I was hooked from then on. I think Tracie Thoms has the most amazing voice and adding Rosario Dawson was a smart move. I have seen the two from the original cast and they were great, but it is probably because I have seen the movie that I prefer Tracie and Rosario.

I am glad they redid the music soundtrack into more modern music than leaving it as 80s. It may sound clich&eacute; but I do believe it reaches my generation better. Some people I know complain about it being too long of a movie in itself, but they love  the music by itself.

The 2-Disc is amazing. If you own it, watch Rent with the commentary on; it is hilarious. Watch the short movie about Johnathan Larson- it will make you teary eyed. Watch all the deleted scenes- my favorite song is in one of them. No matter how depressing the movie is, and believe me I know it is, it is still amazing.",1151884800,,1278,4.204081632653061

On the other hand, I had reservations about seeing the movie myself, because I DO enjoy musicals, but am aware that they often don't translate well to film. And I never did see the stage version of ""Rent""; only ""La Boheme"". However, this fact didn't limit my appreciation for this (film version) of ""Rent"", and perhaps enhanced it. The movie was far better than I expected, with its subtle wit, energy, and surprisingly good music (which beckons repeated listening).

I do concur with others who suggest that key scenes were deleted while others were prolonged; however, the DVD provides an extra disc which includes these scenes, along with the remarkable story of Jonathan Larson's life.

In short, I was captivated from the opening of ""Rent"", through the conclusion of all of the generous supplementary material.

I understand that in even the most depressing themes in a musical, the music still remains exuberant and positive. But something about the music in RENT didn't seem to fit. I found them to be lackluster and not catchy at all. The characters were bland and boring to me. Not much personality, felt more like watching sterotypes on screen with no depth, emotion, or feeling. One of the actresses who played a lesbian was truly the most horrible and over the top actor I've ever seen, just ridiculous and annoying. I'm glad i watched this with a few co-eds than by myself, it made it a tiny bit more enjoyable. Personally though, i hate the movie, and i just don't understand the musical.

2717283,4,B000LXH0AY,"The reviewer who has it dead-on right in these pages is the one who calls out the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived 'Rent' as more opera (using 'La Boheme' as inspiration), not a musical.  And what that means is the the connecting dialogue is sung in stage-voice, not chatted as dialogue.  So, to see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak dialogue like ""I rewired the ATM at the Food Emporium"" when you know it's killing him not to sing it and it's equally killing every Rent fan to hear him constrained to simply mouthing the words...well, it's a major flaw because it deals major blows to the flow and energy of Larson's work.

Other concerns:

* The first-half of the play is re-staged pretty much shot-by-shot. Then, bizarrely (given the fidelity in the first half), the second half veers wildly from the original.  Director Columbus wastes too much time staging ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a way not intended.  Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 - 10 minutes he tacks on here could have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact.

* The deleted scenes aren't trvial matters - 'Rent' is a hard story to follow for the unitiated.  Each one of those scenes could have helped explain the the storyline.

* Surely one of the reasons to prop up ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was to get more Idina Menzel in there.  [Menzel (the original Elephaba in ""Wicked"" and the original Maureen here) has ascended to Broadway royalty, so who can blame Columbus?]  But, if so, why leave out 'Happy New Year?' which features a goodly amount of Maureen?

* The deleted scenes end up de-emphasizing Anthony Rapp's Mark, which is unfortunate because he's the voice and connective thread in the play.  Leaving out his '3D IMAX of my mind...that's poetic...that's pathetic' number is a major ommission, both to Rapp as an actor and to anyone trying to follow the movie - this is the key piece that puts things into perspective for the viewer time-wise.  Why else would Larson strain to put lines in Rapp's monologue like ""Christmas...Christmas Eve last year""  He's framing the scenes for us.

This would be a three-star review, but I'll go for four because of the redeeming nature of the nice documentary about the Larson family - this is very powerful stuff.  It's obvious the family is still hurting deeply 10 years after their loss.",1150675200,,2303,4.646913580246913

I wanted to see this movie mainly for the music.  It didn't disappoint!  I've got to say I've developed myself quite a little crush on Rosario Dawson.  I tell you, that girl NEEDS to put out an album!!!!  She was amazing in this movie!!!!  The whole cast were really good in fact.  They harmonized beautifully!  No matter which few cast members were singing they sounded good together!  Its when you got a whole handful of them singing at the same time that the songs really hit thier peak.  But whether many characters or just two, I don't remember a single song that i vehemently hated with a passion.

As for the story...well...I kinda felt both beat over the head and stabbed at the same time.  Rich people suck, poor people are wonderful, blah blah blah.  I said this as kind of a joke, but I realized it could've been absolutely true and why they did it.  #####There's a scene in a dinner where all the poor people are going around and pushing the tables together.  At the end of thier line, three rich guys (the ones who want to tear down their apartments to make a cyber cafe or something) are sitting there.#####  Now it just so happens the poor people have square tables.  They can push their tables together and converse.  The rich peoples' table however is round, meaning they can't connect with anybody.  Which is, in fact, the point of the movie from what I could gather.  Rich people are bad and poor people are a proud people.

This movie is very black and white when it comes to who the villians are and who the good people are supposed to be.  Maybe the musical itself is better on this.  Dont know, never seen it.

Duh! First of all this isn't a documentary.  Second, the movie even posts the year in the opening scene just to give the audience a reference of the time period.  Alphabet City may be posh now, but it wasn't then.

Anyways, as a faithful follower to the original musical, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  I most definitely recommend this to anyone, but also recommend that you buy the original cast recording to compliment your Rent experience. :-)

Pros:

-The new arrangements give the classic songs a more ""complete"" sound.  ""Take Me or Leave Me"" is probably the biggest (and best) change.

-The visuals make the stage version come alive.

-The original cast was kept intact (save for Mimi who was pregnant at the time and Joanne who felt she was too old for the part).

Cons: (compared to the original)

-The story changed in some instances.

-The songs are less connected by their common sounds/instruments.  While I like the songs individually, the musical continuity is a bit more subdued due to the arrangements.

-Maureen's opening scene (her performance) was just a big ""Yikes!"" in my book.  Instead of her belting all the lines and introducing herself to the audience, she makes it seem like it's a quirky grade school performance.

Neutral:

-The connecting/chorus songs are gone and replaced by speaking lines instead.  Sometimes this works, but other times, you can tell the actors just really want to sing the line.  This also takes away from the musical feel.  So it's bittersweet I guess.

-Also, the voices of all the actors are more homogeneous sounding, whereas in the musical, each voice is quite distinct.",1150329600,,1955,4.822289156626506

I managed to see the movie and immediatly forced all of my freinds to watch it with me. Within 2 weeks we knew all of the songs and majority of the choreography, especially La Vie Boheme and Take Me Or Leave Me.

But i digress, i beame upset after reading that T. Nakajima assumed that Johnathan Larson was not responsible for the ""mediocore rock numbers."" If such a harsh assumption is going to be made, it must be done in a more respectable manner.

2717288,5,B000LXH0AY,"I believe that ALL fans of the original Broadway play will love this movie. They may not like it better, but they should love it! It's emotions are so powerful, so tense, you can feel it. It's a ROCK musical that has every word ringing in your ear with lots of meaning. Not many musicals move their story along with music like this one does. You really need to pay attention to the lyrics here.

If you're a fan but haven't seen this movie yet, you should. Tracie Thoms (Joanne) and Rosario Dawson (Mimi) fill the shoes of Fredi Walker and Daphne Rubin-Vega PERFECTLY. All the other 6 people ARE FROM THE ORIGNAL CAST!

Here are some of the reasons why I think the movie version of Rent works out a little better than the broadway play:

A more logical plot: In the original cast play, half of it takes place on Christmas, at least from 9:00 P.M. on December 24 to perhaps early in the morning on December 25th. That would mean everything from the song ""Rent"" to ""La Vie Bohme B"" took place during a period of only a few hours. It's almost impossible. But here, half of everything takes place from 9 pm December 24th to when everybody in the restaurant is singing ""La Vie Bohme B"" late at night on December 26th.

I also like how much fat has been trimmed from the original Broadway play. ""Rent"" was originally a rock opera. Much of what was sung in the original play is now spoken dialouge in the movie, with almost the exact same words too. We now have that, and the major songs. Perfect!

What I also like is how the movie starts out with ""Seasons of Love."" This song is now sung by the 8 stars only (not to mention, along with the rest of all the music, has much more clearer vocals, and layered, more full instrumentation). It's perfect because it basically introduces what the play is about. ""Seasons of Love B"" keeps its original spot, except it comes before Maureen's and Joanne's ""Take Me Or Leave Me."" ""Seasons of Love"" is supposed to be feel good, and the movie does a perfect job of it.

I recommend this movie to both fans and non-fans of Rent, and fans and non-fans of musicals/operas. Rent basically turned me into an addict of itself and made me a fan of musicals. I often thought of most musicals as things for kids but not after Rent.

Please see this eye-opening, heart-racing, goosebump forming, and tear-jerking movie! You won't regret it.",1149638400,,2360,4.436489607390301
2717289,2,B000LXH0AY,"I must confess that I have never seen the original theatre. I hear many avid fans praise the filmed version as well as the original. My impression is simply this; ""why so long?"" And ""why so annoying?"" And most of all, why Chris Columbus?

Or how about this - Why it took so long to make a filmed version? They should have done it much earlier. Today the story of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City is no longer credible and attractive enough. NYC has changed a lot since the 1990s while the film seems unaware of that, resulting in the detached feeling. What was refreshing in 1996 is no longer so to most of us in 2005.

Of course, stage musical is a different thing, where you are directly invited to the world you are watching, and the actors' pure energy with dynamic singing makes you forget the weakness of the setting and the plot. The key to the film adaptation is how to transfer the energy to the screen. John Cameron Mitchell knew it as in `Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which is a knock-out experience from the first to the end.

But Columbus, whose CV includes `Home Alone' and `Harry Potter,' doesn't seem to know it. Look at the number ""La Vie Boheme"" that is supposed to be a show-stopper. Sorry if you liked the piece, but to me the utterly offensive ""anthem"" is just rubbish. With the stereotyped images about artists, and worse, homosexuals, the scene is only useful in proving how the mainstream filmmakers look at the Bohemians and create these thin, clichd characters on the screen. Do they really act like that on stage? Or is this scene really supposed to be done like that?

Among this faux Bohemian world, however, some actors manage to be real. Anthony Rapp is amazing, probably the only actor in the cast, who embodies a spirit of the rebellious Bohemian artist in the film. Rosario Dawson is seductive while dancing, and Taye Diggs is impressive (as always) as one former roommate with a more level-headed perspective. However, the rest of the film is about some good musical songs, many mediocre rock numbers (for which the original creator of the musical Jonathen Larsen is not responsible, I think), and some not-so-great acting from the cast.

The lengthy film remains mediocre from the beginning to the end, and that is the worst thing done to the material that is supposed to be unique and original, hymn to love and life.",1149379200,,2366,4.583924349881797

I did not have the chance to see the movie in theaters, but instantly fell in love with its soundtrack.  By the time I was able to buy the movie, i had the whole thing memorized and had found my passion.  I have seriously lost count of how many times I have watched this movie and am not overexagerating in saying that I have prpbably seen it 50 times in the last three months (if not under exagerating).  The best part is that since there are so many characters in so many scenes, you can watch a different person each time and have a totally different expereince.  Adam Pascal blew me away with some of his work as Roger and I am greatly taken by his song ""One Song Glory"".

On top of all that, from a stylistic point of view, the plot was just absurd, the characters were intensely unlikeable and unsympathetic (I absolutely DETESTED every single one of them, Angel especially), the songs' melodies were grating, and the lyrics were just plain stupid. People in the theater actually laughed at parts that were supposed to be serious because the movie was that aweful. In short, avoid at all costs.",1149033600,,647,5.05607476635514

The opening scene was nicely done as was the Maureen Tango which had to be my favorite scene along with the scene when they are at the restuarant.

I really loved all the actors espically Jermaine Herdia as Angel. He does a great job at portraying a crossdresser. Rosario Dawson also does a wonderful job during Mimi's withdrawal scene.

So if you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like you're apart of it Rent is that movie.

2717293,5,B000LXH0AY,"I've always wanted to see RENT, although I was just a lowly teenager when it first appeared on Broadway, so I didn't give it a second thought. I really just liked to see the commercial. Friends holding arm-in-arm, walking down the street, singing a song with lyrics I could barely make out.

Whatever. I saw Rent the movie for the first time 2 days ago. I LOVED it. Although it was supposed to be set in NY, 1989-1990, and battled topics that I have virtually no familiarity with - it's like I could feel everything was happening to the characters. That's when I know I've connected physically with a movie. Granted, I have no non-internet knowledge of RENT, the Broadway Musical, I still hope to see it one day and figure that if it's as good as the film, I'll be blown away. Permanently.

I connected with all of the characters and their struggles, although I didn't at first. I still feel that Benny, played by Tate Digg's role in the movie is insignificant, and I couldn't figure out Mark's role/issues in the whole thing. Apparently, this is explained more in depth in the play, and in the extended version of ""Goodbye Love"". The film is not a goody-goody comical version of something deep and dark like ""Chicago"" was. It presents issues and deals with them in a subtle way. And yes, with a soundtrack and a montage of scenes that are both refreshing AND depressing. One scene that is especially sad is the one at the Life Support group(for those with AIDS) that goes with the song ""Will I?""

""Will I lose my dignity,
Will someone care
Will I wake tomorrow,
From this nightmare?""

Haunting.

I thought Rosario Dawson did a very good job in the role of Mimi. Her voice isn't exceptionally strong, and listening to ""Out Tonight"" (one of my favorite tracks) on my Ipod, I could hear the guitar chords overpowering her voice. Other than that, I felt she did fine. One overall theme of the movie was centered on the recurring lyrics of ""No Day But Today"". As 4 out of the 8 main characters have AIDS, it's befitting that they live their life to the fullest.

I don't feel complled to comment any further, 'cept to say that you can't please everyone. There are people who like the play, but don't like the film. Then others that like the film, but don't like to play. I'm content in knowing that the best of RENT is out there for everyone in more than one form. So choose what satisfies you.

I'm always a little apprehensive of musicals, having people burst into song in the middle of a movie always has a tendency of making me cringe because it's so corny.

I have to admit, I loved this movie.

I loved the fact that most of the actors were the originals who were on Broadway, so they knew what they were doing, which saves the film from any huge embarassments.

Most of the songs are pretty catchy, I especially liked ""Seasons of Love"", ""Take Me Or Leave Me"" and the performance that came with ""Today 4 U"" was amazing.

Although I did cringe once or twice, the movie stays really enjoyable, I had a lot of fun watching it, which surprised me because half of the characters have AIDS, so i'll give props for being able to talk about this sensitive, relatively gloomy, subject and still being able to pull off an upbeat movie, at least most of the time.  And even when it does get somewhat depressing and sad, it manages to stay relatively positive.

Overall, while Rent doesn't have the same quality or magic that Chicago had, it still has plenty enough, and makes this an enjoyable experience.  Plus the extras in this edition are great.",1147910400,,1211,4.497716894977169
2717295,5,B000LXH0AY,"Being one of the few people that you have met that have actually seen the original early 90's broadway show ""RENT"" I can tell you honestly that in compare that this film is very different not really in a bad way but all around - different. I don't know if any of you knew this but the director of the ""Harry Potter"" movie also created this movie, though that does seem somewhat different he does an all around pretty d*mn good job of making this movie as good as possible.

Going into the film don't expect much of anything other than over two hours of singing that supports an all around great plot. Though at some times during the film you do wish they would slow down the music a little and try to have a little bit more normal dialouge ... the music is still really wonderful and throughout the film you are more than a bit entertained.

I'm also sure that some of you may have heard that some of the people from the original cast played their parts in the new movie, this was overall pretty good just because all of the original performers are absolutly brilliant!, the only thing that bothers me is that in the film all of the people are supposed to be in their early twenties .... I'm sure you would agree that some of them look like they are only the verge of turning 40 or so (or at least 35...), one really suprizing thing was that they got Rosario Dawson to play a part, though I was skeptical of this choice I was overall pretty pleased with her performance not only in the acting portion but the singing as well, she is the real deal as an actress.

I thought that at a few parts of ""RENT"" that things got just a nidge jumbed mostly because the very little amount of actual dialouge (besides the singing!) .... but the singing alone makes this a great film that I would recommend to most people, except for maybe conservetive people or people that don't like musicals, do keep in mind it in some parts is a little bit riscay but it's not like ... ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or anything...

2717297,4,B000LXH0AY,"Some Rent-o-philes can't get over the liberties taken by the film version of the beloved Broadway show, but judging a film by the same standards as a theatrical production is simply unfair.  This film does its very best to capture the heart and spirit of the show without trying to outdo the stage show with film-only effects, sets, and superstar casting.  True, some of the original cast members had to be replaced for the film (the most notable substitution being Rosario Dawson as Mimi), but the stage show is still present by all accounts.  Roger, Mark, Maureen, Collins, and Angel are back for the film version and manage to maintain their strong performances after god knows how many times around.  The filmmakers made strategic decisions of which songs to leave out, with some not being missed (Contact - a strange, staccato chanting of sexual innuendo and warnings) and others questionably absent (Goodbye Love, one of the most poignant songs of the entire show).  Overall, the film does the show as much justice as it can and respects the origins of these songs as it portrays them for a larger audience.  The second disc of special features is mostly just a two-hour tribute to the writer of the show which, frankly, could have been done in about thirty minutes.  The commentary track is decent, but doesn't shed as much light on production decisions or other differences between the film and the stage show as I would have liked.",1147564800,,1440,4.805668016194332
2717298,4,B000LXH0AY,"Almost 10 years ago, a Broadway musical named ""Rent"" opened and quickly spawned a devoted legion of fans known as ""Rent-heads.""  A film version of the show was inevitable but took almost a decade to reach the big screen.  Was it worth the wait?  Well, yes and no.

First, the good news: the overall spirit of the stage show, which I'll admit I've seen nine times, is intact.  The music is still excellent, and six of the eight original Broadway cast members reprise their portrayals for the big screen (and the two new additions are surprisingly strong as well).  If you've never seen the show (and most people haven't), you should still enjoy the film if you're a fan of musicals, rock music, and/or the independent spirit of broke twentysomethings.  If you can't stand movies where the characters frequently and spontaneously break into song, avoid this film (though these songs are much closer to today's rock music than most musicals you'll see).

Now, the disappointing news: while the spirit remains the same and the cast is strong, director Chris Columbus (who directed the first two--and blandest--""Harry Potter"" films) has made enough needless changes to the source material that the overall film will likely leave a frustrated taste in any hardcore Rent-head's mouth.  Some of the changes are good (having ""Santa Fe"" sung on a subway car works very well, and even the risky move of setting ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a country club pays off), but Columbus tries too hard to please mass audiences by using flashier locations (Roger now sings ""What You Own"" in the middle of the New Mexico desert, making the number seem like a Calvin Klein ad) and replacing some of the musical's sung lyrics with spoken dialogue (which has a negatively comic effect for anyone already familiar with the show's music; imagine hearing Dorothy speak the lyrics to ""Over the Rainbow"" in ""The Wizard of Oz"").

Regardless of whether or not you've seen ""Rent"" on stage, you should see the film if you're a fan of the musical genre.  It is a good film.  But the show is better.

A note about the DVD:

The bonus disc contains a great documentary called ""No Day But Today,"" which details ""Rent"" creator Jonathan Larson's life and the eventual genesis of ""Rent.""  The documentary is excellent, especially considering it's a special feature on a DVD.  It stands well enough on its own that any fan of the show will love it whether or not they liked the film.

The bonus disc also includes alternate/deleted scenes and songs including ""Goodbye, Love,"" ""Halloween,"" and an alternate ending that is far superior to the one they ended up using and closer to the ending of the stage show.  (Chris Columbus's commentary track on the alternate ending reveals his uncertainty with using the ending they did use, and he was right to be uncertain; he should have gone with his gut and kept this one.)",1147046400,,2870,4.763636363636364

2717302,5,B000LXH0AY,"To tell you the truth, I was afraid to see RENT, the film.  I was privileged enough to see the Broadway production and it was an incandescent experience.  Needless to say, I wanted to preserve that and enjoy the soundtrack.  But on one rainy Sunday afternoon on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I tuned in to On-Demand and ordered the film.  I was hooked from the opening moment on.  So I cleared away whatever distractions I had brought with me to the couch to divert my attention from awful scenes filmmakers sometimes include in their films, and I sat back and let the experience unfold.  It was glistening!

The palette of the film is the same as the artwork used on the original Broadway production.  All but 2 of the main characters are from the original cast.  I have to say I was even worried about that.  Though I would enjoy seeing them again, would the passing of time preserve the spirit of those performances?  Not only is it preserved, but it has deepened!  Even so, after 10 years would time have not weathered their faces and developed their physiques beyond character believability?  Surprisingly, not in the least!  The performers and performances are timeless.  And would the two new performances dislodge the structure and momentum of the piece?  Not in the least.  Wonderfully, they are so there!  Further anxieties left me wondering if it would be a hungry RENT or one sated by Hollywood?  And was Chris Columbus really the right director to bring it to the screen?  Chris Columbus really understood the piece, translated it well, and made sure he kept it hungry.  And thank you very much for the skyline shot of the World Trade Center!

Another area of concern is the need to open it up for the film medium.  This is successfully achieved in the ""Tango Maureen"" and ""Out Tonight"" numbers.  Unfortunately, I did not find it as successfully done in two scenes.  For one, the scene in which Joanne takes Mark and Maureen to the Buzzline offices, and the other was the ""Take Me or Leave Me"" number.  Unfortunately both these scenes contain the characters Maureen and Joanne.  The first maybe to give them something more to do that actually makes less of their use.  In addition the palette changes and becomes a bit flat - my apologies to a wonderful cinematographer.  And the other unfortunately has brilliant performances from both of the characters; but again, the room, the set, somethig about the environment doesn't match the rest of the film.

That said, I want to encourage anyone who has seen the musical and had some reservations about seeing the film to do immediately!  Believe me, the music is so, so powerful and its treated really, really well that it makes the performances and visuals that much more enjoyable.  By the time you get to the end and ask yourself if they've done the piece justice, I have a strong feeling you'll agree with me that they have.

In addition, the special DVD set includes the documentary called, NO DAY BUT TODAY which gives the background story of  Jonathan Larson's short life, death and the birth of RENT.  You'll meet the cast, producers, family and friends.  You'll come to love Jonathan's family just as much as you do his baby, RENT!",1145923200,,3204,4.689407540394973
2717303,1,B000LXH0AY,"I saw the stage production of RENT several years ago and thought it was wonderful - one of the most heartfelt, daring and compelling Broadway musicals I had ever seen.  I distinctly remember sitting in the theatre and thinking Act I was great and Act II was spectacular.  I couldn't wait to see a filmed version of this groundbreaking work.

Well, what a HUGE disappointment.  The film rendition of Johnathan Larson's play was an anachronistic mess that at times seemed so syrupy sweet I thought I'd need a massive dose of insulin!  It also felt oddly outdated, as if it was made 15 years too late.  And, the oddest and most inexplicable thing of all is that some actors who appeared in both the stage and filmed versions of the work seemed miscast in the film, creating major credibility problems!  They actually made me feel uneasy because their characters had a comical edge that was definitely not intended.  This was an odd phenomenon that led me to believe the problem with the film was its director.  Chris Columbus, the captain of this sinking ship,  was completely out of his league - he just didn't have the chops to give it the edginess or urgency that it deserved, and that really came through on stage.  I am not of the school of thought that stage plays never translate well to film - just look at  DEATH OF A SALESMAN, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE or musicals like WEST SIDE STORY, DAMN YANKEES, or BYE BYE BIRDIE.  And one of my favorite musicals of all time did not originate as a stage play and was considered a brilliant example of the French New Wave -  a work called THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG -  that proved musicals could be intensely powerful.  RENT, however, simply missed the mark.  It was disjointed, unbearably long, way too politically correct and terribly dull.  And I could swear Chris Columbus added material to the film not present in the original stage production that further weakened the potency of its story.  So, in summation, this was an extremely unflattering filmed translation of an otherwise powerful statement on a particularly dark period in our history.  Too bad...

2717304,2,B000LXH0AY,"I fully understand how difficult it must be to adapt a stage musical/rock opera to work as a movie. If you did not see the stageshow, don't bother watching this version as you will most probably hate it. But if you did see the show, you will in all probability be disappointed with the movie (but you won't necessarily hate it). It was decided that the characters would speak more dialogue than in the stage version. I would have gone for wall to wall music and truly kept it a rock OPERA, because it just doesnt work anymore for a character to speak and then suddenly start singing. Not in this setup where they tried to be as ""real"" as possible. Even though they are a bit too old for their parts, I accepted the original cast members and respect them for originating the amazingly successful Broadway show.

Completely the opposite of my experience in the theatre (I saw it in 1998). I know some devoted fans LOVE the film and I am glad they do - as we need to see more musicals on film. But after this movie I am sure the studios will think thrice before attempting another stage to screen movie musical. RENT was a gamble that did not pay off. And I am very sorry about it, as I WANTED it to work.

There is a very insightful documentary on disc 2 (about the tragic story of Jonathan Larson, the creator of RENT) as well as some deleted scenes and even an alternative ending.

2717305,2,B000LXH0AY,"Okay, full confession up front: I have never seen the Broadway musical on which this film is based, but I have walked by the Nederlander theatre where it plays and seen the lobby tricked out like some Epcot Center approximation of the ""actual"" Lower East Side of Manhattan, where both play and film are supposed to be set.  I have, however, seen well north of a thousand films, including more than a few musicals, some of which I actually enjoyed, so I do think I can give ""Rent,"" the movie, a fair shake as a reviewer.  That said, what I did see was a phony and hollow co-opting the very counterculture that ""Rent"" pretends to celebrate.

Just as ""Hair"" (play & film) was a vision of what total squares saw of the 60's counterculture, ""Rent"" updates that vision to 1989, where there was indeed a thriving artistic community in the Lower East Side, one that even produced some interesting results.  Of course, ""Rent"" is also a (very) loose adaptation of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"" (if Puccini were alive today he would roll over in his grave--LOL) so composer Jonathen Larsen had no responsibility to get his setting just right.  That he managed to get so much so wrong is another matter.  Or should I say sanitized?  Or cartoon-ified, if that makes any sense.  The songs and music, which have been hailed as the closest the American theatre has ever come to actual rock music, turns out to be mainly sappy power ballads ready-made for a particularly ""rebellious"" American Idol contestant.  One song that attempts to be what I think was indended as rap is so embarrassing that even Vanilla Ice seems hardcore by comparison.  The clothes the characters wear are the types of outfits that would get them laughed at by even  the leather/safety pin/mohawk trust fund punks who beg for change on St. Marks Place.  Okay, in one scene Idina Menzel's Maureen does a bit of ""performance art"" that's every bit as excruciating (albeit PG-13 sanitized) as the real thing.  Problem is, I think it wasn't intended to seem that way! It should also be noted that most of the cast, who originated their roles in the musical's first run, now seem way too old for their characters, and the effect is more midlife crisis than downtown cool.

In the showstopping set piece anthem ""La Vie Boheme"" the thinly drawn characters dance around a faux-authentic Lower East Side pub and name check edgy artists that range from Alan Ginsberg and John Cage to Susan Sontag and The Sex Pistols.  needless to say, a movie shepherded by ""Home Alone""/""Harry Potter"" helmer Chris Columbus is about as ""edgy"" as a nerf ball.  ""Rent"" tries to sell us prepackaged rebellion as just a bunch of lovable eccentrics (with few eccentricities to speak of) and doomed romantics, most of whom, we are to believe suffer from (oh excuse me--are ""surviving with"") AIDS.  In this movie, the worst symptom of the disease is apparently to look kind of run-down and tired, but not too tired to belt out a heart-tugging ballad or two.  This watering-down of a very real pandemic is more offensive than any of the supposedely ""shocking"" behavior any of our Bohemian heroes are supposed to delight in.  Frankly, I couldn't stop thinking of the skewering ""Rent"" took in the film ""Team America: World Police""--""Everyone has AIDS!""  Indeed.

I will grant that there are a couple of effective numbers that recall--I believe on purpose--Brecht and Weill, and as a whole the cast has energy to spare and obviously have learned from experience to play off each other very well.  I also dug the cameo by Sarah Silverman as an oily TV executive, but then I'm a sucker for Ms. Silverman in general.  A few bright spots, however, cannot rescue this muddled morass of mediocrity.  Since I've been prattling on now for what seems like 525,600 minutes, if you still think you really have to see this, the title suggests how you should go about it.  I know I've garnered a few ""not helpful"" votes from fans of the play/movie, to those just curious let me say: be wary.  Be very, very wary.",1145232000,,4017,4.702857142857143

My daughter and I rented it on her birthday and snuggled down to watch it, my husband soon joined in and actually stayed!

CAPTIVATING! When the movie is over I found myself lost in thoughts, and a whole new area opened up to talk with my kids about.

This movie is a life changer, and I think my husbands description sums it up the best.. ""I really got into it and forgot they where singing.""

I loved it, so much we now own the musical CD as well.",1145232000,,656,3.984732824427481

2717309,5,B000LXH0AY,"I love ""Rent.""

From the first time I saw the musical, I couldn't get it out of my head.

If wearing out a CD was possible, I would have done so with the soundtrack. Borderline obsessed, I was blown away with the energy, the vitality; it was raw, it was sexual, it was passionate.

I never got to see the original cast perform the show, though. I understand that was quite a sight to behold.

So you see, when I heard the majority of the original cast were to perform in the film, I was ecstatic. I vigorously defended the casting of the ""older"" actors; my letter to that effect made it into Entertainment Weekly way back when.

When the film soundtrack arrived, I could not wait and listened to it over and over again...and if you have checked out the spotlight review over there on Amazon, you'll see how impressed I was.

This film is a respectful recreation of ""Rent"", using the people who know it best. It loses some heat in its' gritty ""expansion"" into the real world, but I cannot deny the visceral thrill of seeing these originators coming back one more time for Jonathan.

And that's the bottom line: this is for Jonathan Larson. This is a huge valentine for him. I imagine he would have been touched that so many people care, and so many people came back to do this.

The song sequence is a bit rearranged; a few bits and songs are excised. The actual storytelling is more clear, more straightforward. My wife actually preferred this version to the stage version.

It's not perfect. My initial experience in the theater noticed a few slow spots. The fade-to-blacks seemed to take forever. But that was more than likely my impatience in getting to ""the good stuff."" And there's a lot of good stuff here.

The flaming rain in the title song. Rosario Dawson's searingly sexy performance in both ""Light My Candle"" and ""Out Tonight."" Tracie Thoms' powerhouse vocals in...well...pretty much every time she opened her mouth. Her duet with Idina Menzel in ""Take Me or Leave Me"" starts off stiff (that whole commitment ceremony felt forced) but ends with fireworks. The ""Tango Maureen"", with Anthony Rapp, is a lovely stylistic change from the original show...with the extended tango sequence a visual treat. Adam Pascal's rocking Roger belts out soaring melodies, and still manages to look tortured. His confessional ""Your Eyes"" works MUCH better here than in the stage version. The song works better sung to one person than to an audience.

What more can be said about Jesse L. Martin? His soulful exuberance lights up the screen with every smile. His acrobatic ""Santa Fe"" on a subway car is a joy; his duet with Wilson Jermaine Heredia strolling through Tompkins Square Park in ""I'll Cover You"" was one of the most romantic scenes I've seen in a film in years.

And let's get back to Mr. Heredia. His Angel character is the film's sweet, emotional core. By using little touches like a wink here, a smile there, a pinky wave...when Angel gets sick, you're devastated. Even when you know it's coming. And finally Anthony Rapp's performance as the observer/commentator holds everything together. He creates perspective for us.

""La Vie Boheme"" has the whole cast in a hyper-verbal, hip-thrusting, table-hopping, orgiastic frenzy, and I loved every second of it.

Only Taye Diggs seems to get shorted; but that's the fault of the character Benny. He just doesn't have much to do when compared to the big, colorful people surrounding him.

Chris Columbus does a fine job here. Making it ""real"" was the only style choice he had. Anything else would have meant simply sticking a camera in a theater and filming a stage show. I'm not a director, and I'm so enamored of the show...so protective of it, really...that of course I think there are things that could have been done better. Like the editing. It should have been ""peppier"", more energetic. But the thing is I'm probably wrong. I cut people open for a living, I don't cut film. It would have ended up looking like a bad commercial or music video. This film breathes.

Although, I wish they could have edited in the song ""Halloween"", and I actually prefer the alternate ending to the one in the film. Probably because it's more like the original. Definitely check out the deleted scenes.

You really need to see the documentary on disc two. It will make the experience of seeing ""Rent"" infinitely better. In fact, you'll race to re-watch the film after seeing this. It's one of the best making-of's around. If you don't openly weep at least twice while you're watching, you have no business seeing this movie. The abbreviated life of Jonathan Larson is now inextricably linked with ""Rent."" I wish I had known the guy. That's the feeling you get watching this very well made documentary.

This musical about the precious brevity of life is populated by the very people you see in this documentary. I'm not talking about the actors. You'll see his actual, old friends and think, ""Is that Roger? Couldn't that be Joanne?""

And they are. They all are.

And the characters are all Jonathan as well.

I came to love his parents and his sister, caring for this musical, tending to it, protecting it, all in the love and remembrance of their son and brother. This is all they have left of him, and they've ensured it will last forever.

As one mysterious person said, breaking the silence after the first performance of the show following his death...

""Thank you Jonathan Larson.""",1144281600,,5426,4.72457627118644

2717311,3,B000LXH0AY,"As fans of the original show know, ""Rent"" is not a musical; it is a rock opera. There is very little spoken dialogue in the original show. Instead, the songs are connected by dialogue (or monologue) that is sung in rhythms closer to natural speech. (This resembles classical opera, where the arias are connected by recitative, which is a form of song-speech.) This is brilliantly executed in the original ""Rent"": the music and words of the dialogue are woven together very effectively. It is clear that Jonathan Larson devoted a considerable portion of his creativity to the connecting sections between the songs.

Unfortunately, the makers of the movie chose to convert all of the connecting sections into spoken dialogue. This was a disastrous decision. The original show has a kinetic momentum created by the music, which propels the story forward. In contrast, the movie tends to stall between the songs. Sometimes the actors speak the lyrics from the original show, but it doesn't work. The words don't sound like they were meant to be spoken, because they weren't: they were meant to be sung! In other places, the makers of the movie added their own dialogue, and in a couple places whole new scenes. To put it kindly, these additions are less than inspired.

What makes all this so frustrating is that the songs in the movie are very good: they are well sung, well acted, and well choreographed. I found myself enjoying the songs thoroughly, and then cringing and groaning during the sections between the songs. This movie could have been excellent if the makers had adhered to Larson's original vision. Instead they delivered a hybrid of brilliance and mediocrity. Perhaps they thought they could reach a wider audience if they offered a more familiar ""product"" which didn't demand that its audience sit through two hours of singing. Given some of the themes within the show itself, this is quite ironic! If the makers of the film had respected the artistic integrity of Larson's work, they would have created a work of much greater impact, and in my opinion, they would probably have sold more tickets too.",1143936000,,2115,4.905027932960894
2717312,5,B000LXH0AY,"Up until very recently I've been listening to the songs over and over, sometimes full version and sometimes just the 30 seconds clips that Amazon provides in its soundtrack page. Needless to say, I love Rent, so I felt that it was finally time to buy the movie for my own collection. Let me tell you, I got my money's worth. The 2-disc version not only includes a 5 star movie based on the broadway rock opera, but it also includes special features such as deleted scenes or music sequences. It also included an excellent documentary.

In this documentary, which I think is about an hour or so long, original cast members are interviewed and the beginnings of Rent are explained like Pucini's La Boheme and the effect of the '80's epidemic on the writer. It also talks about the different stages of Rent--from workshop, dress rehearsals, opening night, broadway, and all the way to the movie. There are a lot of interesting tid-bits, but for the most part, the documentary focuses on the writer and what lead him to write and compose Rent.

All in all this is an excellent buy and I highly recommend it, although I must warn you: the songs are highly addictive. It usually takes a week or two for me to get the songs un-stuck from my head. Other than that, excellent movie. Great actors and director. Did you know that 6 of the 8 original cast members are in this movie? There is such a comeradie and chemistry in the movie, that it just blows you away. Even the new additions make the movie magical.

Sooo, go buy or rent Rent (pun intended). Sing along if you already know the words and then watch the documentary. All in all an excellent buy.",1143849600,,1645,4.494983277591973
2717313,4,B000LXH0AY,"...but I think it would have worked better in that medium. I liked the film alot, great music, but it just seems a case where the real world is too real for a musical. I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.",1143763200,,242,4.170212765957447
2717314,4,B000LXH0AY,"The performances and the songs in ""Rent"" are as best as can be for the difficult task of adapting from stage to screen. A top-notch cast. However, I wanted to point out how one song was kind of ruined for me. When Roger turns down Mimi's advances, it's not only because he's HIV+ and has been hurt by the death of his girlfriend. It's also because he's a recovering injection drug user, and he finds out Mimi is a user. That gives him a very good reason for not wanting to be involved with her! But the whole cast is singing ""No day but today"", urging him to not reject a chance at love (granted, they don't know she's a junkie). So the emotion of that song (which is kind of the theme song for the whole movie) for me is lost because it's a bunch of people urging their friend to get involved with a junkie.  It's supposed to be a celebratory, life-affirming, love-encouraging song. Also, I wanted to add that the 2nd disc that comes in this set is really great. You see deleted scenes, but best of all is a long documentary about Jonathan Larson.",1143763200,,1048,4.292929292929293
2717315,5,B000LXH0AY,"I live to far away from New York to have ever gotten the chance to see this on Broadway, but I did listen to the soundtrack several years ago of the Original Cast, so when I heard a film version was coming out I was excited to see it for the first time.

I could not have been more moved by this film. Alot of people tried to tell me not to see this because of the many issues it addresses such as gays, lesbians, AIDS, drug addictions,cross dressing and so on and so forth. I feel people who look at this in a small minded view will not see the beautiful story it tells.

I believe this film captured me from the moment of silence before ""Seasons of Love"" started until the very end when my eyes were so filled with tears that I couldn't hold back. I feel like I know each of the characters personally. they are people I could know and hang out with and who would deal with my hardships and I would deal with theirs.

It is artistic, real, beautiful, and reverent when it deals with the support group when it could have turned sappy and to mushy for me to feel connected to or even understand. I thank Chris Columbus for that.

Overall, it has to be one of the best films I have ever seen.......EVER.

Thank you Jonathan Larson for you music!",1143676800,,1243,4.1625

2717317,4,B000LXH0AY,"My first RENT experience occurred on Broadway.  There was so much hype surrounding the play at the time that a let down (considering my expectations) was, perhaps, inevitable.  Still, I liked many of the musical numbers and that prompted me to buy the soundtrack.  And that is where I fully appreciated what Jonathan Larson had created.
Flash forward several years later and I still listened to the original Broadway soundtrack when I heard that a RENT movie was finally going to happen.  I thought the trailer was great, giving you a real sense of what was at the heart of the movie: love and friendship.
I love the movie.  It was great of Chris Columbus to utilize so many of the original Broadway cast members.  The musical numbers, I thought, were crisper and tighter: edgier, if you will, than on the stage.  I actually find myself preferring many of the film's song versions than the Broadway versions.  I do prefer the original Mimi's voice, Daphne Rubin-Vega, but Rosario Dawson is still great.  Whoduthunk?
Chris Columbus' use of flashbacks to show the Roger-April relationship was a nice touch and it was sad (in a good way) to see Angel slowly slip away to AIDS - something you didn't get in the stage version.
It's a long movie, but so is the play.  With the magic of DVD it's great that we still get to see some original numbers such as ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye Love"" which were cut from the movie.  I still think ""Goodbye Love"" should have been included in the film's final cut.
The documentary on Jonathan Larson was really great, thorough and informative.  It's wonderful to see how his parents carried the torch for him after his untimely passing. And the director's commentary with Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal was fun (who'd have thought that Taye Diggs performance during the funeral scene was so bad it had to be cut?).
Gripes?  Not many.  I wish the trailers would have been included in the extras.  Also, it would have been fun to hear from more of the cast in the commentary.
During the commentary, Chris Columbus also mentioned several scenes that were filmed, including, for example, April's suicide scene.  If they were going to be cut from the movie, they should have at least shown up as deleted scenes.  It also would have been nice to include the video diaries that were on-line during the making of the movie on the DVD as Peter Jackson is doing for KING KONG.
At the end of the day, RENT, the movie, is a great final tribute to the play that shook Broadway to its core. And I am anxiously awaiting the chance to see the play again.",1143504000,,2564,4.6
2717318,1,B000LXH0AY,"I am still on a Rent strike: Director Chris Columbus' cinematic take on Jonathan Larson's tale of friends and lovers, junkies and transsexuals, battling AIDS, poverty and  other assorted maladies of the this thing called Life remains overblown, overwrought and overdone. On the big screen, ""lame"" also comes into play. Many of the original Broadway cast members are reunited for this gritty, noisy excursion into an underbelly that has gone belly up.",1143417600,,450,5.25
2717319,4,B000LXH0AY,"Rent is a blast! The whole movie is probably 90% all song, and when there is dialogue, it is only to set up the next scene or musical number. The songs, by the way, are not that bad. They're mostly sung dialogue which works, because there's something about singing out words that make the dialogue come to life and feel more personal.

Acting wise, everyone played their parts well and it's no surprise that everyone would be doing a great job as these actors were the same performers that did the play back in the early 90's. So of course, with frequent performances, the actors know these charcters inside and out. The only newcomers were Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, who both do an excellent job of blending in with the original cast and not to mention vocal talents as well.

Musical highlights have to be ""Out Tonight"", ""I'll Cover You"", ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"", ""Take Me or Leave Me"", ""I Should Tell You"" not to mention ""La Vie Boheme"" and ""Finale B"".

The film is about 2 hours and 13 minutes long and for someone who might not be into musicals, this might be a tough film to sit through because by the 1 hour and 15 minute mark, you will be exhausted with how many musical numbers were already performed and how many more there is to go! But for someone who is used to song and dance, this shouldn't be a problem. The charcters and situations are easy to understand and engaging that it won't bore fans.

Watching Rent, I truly believe that this is one rock opera of a movie that somewhat felt epic in terms of its noumerous amount of musical numbers, the one year time span of the film and of how the scenes were shot. Again lots of wide sweeping shots that just make the movie that much bigger and ""epic"" like.

Anyways, go check it out and see if it works for you!",1143417600,,1782,4.371601208459214
2717320,2,B000LXH0AY,"This was really hard to get through. Around the 48 minute point, the urge to turn off the movie became evident and did not leave throughout the whole movie. Rent is set at the East Village of New York City in the late 1980's. The film, adapted from the Broadway show of the same title, follows a group of bohemian artists through their journey of trying to produce the art that they love, yet still be able to have enough money to pay the rent of their respective Penthouses. Apparently, 90% of people that live in New York City have AIDS, or so that is what you are led to believe by this film. Rent tries to grab the bull by the horns and produce a film that touches upon the issues that city dwellers are plagued with. Here are some reasons why it fails to do so.

""Rent"" the film, tries way too hard to replicate ""Rent"" the play, and fails miserably. Many of the original cast members of the stage return to act their roles in the film. The result is a slew of lackluster performances. These actors who are not used to the cameras so close because of the separation they have from the audience on stage seem unemotional and undetermined to make their roles believable. Or maybe it's because when they are on stage they are more diligent on the acting side, but with the audience replaced by a camera, maybe their heart isn't in the role as much as it usually is when they are amongst the people in the crowd. For whichever reason it is, the acting didn't deliver nearly as effectively as it does when seen live on stage.

The musical numbers were sang well and conducted correctly, but yet again the lackluster demeanor of the cast makes the music mediocre at best. When you see the Broadway performance of Rent, the personalities of the actors seem a lot more real. With the separation between you and your TV screen, you realize that the songs are not even as great as you thought they were. The magic of seeing a Broadway show is the relationship that you feel with the actors. There is a certain chemistry that lives in the electricity that the actors emit while on stage. On the big screen, the audience is extremely emotionally detached from the cast, which is very quick to disappoint.

I really think the movie could of worked if it hadn't of focused so much on trying to be the play. Director Chris Columbus tries way to hard to keep the spirit of the stage show, yet produces a sloppy production with a ton of continuity. People appear at scenes to participate in musical numbers, then reappear in the next scene, but at a different setting. The corniness of the film becomes evident when everyone in the streets start singing along with the main actors. Ok...it's a musical...we get it.

In no way does this film represent the stage production of Rent. In fact, the stage production is one of the best and most popular since classics as Cats and Ms. Saigon. The film feels like a parody of the play. It is quite disheartening that this movie was made because now the reputation of Rent will always be linked with this movie. I can not ethically recommend this film, but I can recommend sticking with the play. In fact, I highly recommend the play. As for the movie? Don't waste your money. And if you must, then rent with caution...no pun intended...well maybe a little.

2717321,5,B000LXH0AY,"*What is there to say about Rent? What words can be used? How about dynamic? Amazing? Masterpiece? I think those and others would be feasible. This movie adaption of Jonathan Larson's 1996 Pulitzer Prize Award-winning musical is nothing short of wonderful. It shows the ties that bind a friendship between eight people living in Bohemian New York ""at the end of the millenium"". Larson was a genius and provided musical numbers that touch both the heart and the mind, as well as the spirit. The lyrics are flowing and the music itself is show-stopping.

*One other thing I'd like to point out: According to a certain reviewer named ""Kommisar"", this movie is gay. Wow. What a profound statement. And according to his  friends, if you're a guy, and you like Rent, then you're gay. I happen to be straight, and Rent is my favorite musical of all time, and the movie is way up there on my list as well. So, I believe I just punched a minor hole in this adolescent's statement. These asinine friends of his need to give some backup as to why they hate this. It makes me angry when I see someone say crap like that, but give nothing else. ""This movie sucks"" is not a review. It's a desperate cry for attention.

*I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone who is a fan of Broadway shows. Again, Jonathan Larson (book writer, musical composer, and lyricist for Rent) was a genius, and had his life not been tragically cut short, I bet we would have seen more great works come from him. As for the film adaption of the sstage version? It was done well. The actors get through to the audience, and stunning performances are given by Anthony Rapp and Roger Davis, as well as others. The movie is supposed to stick to the storyline of the rock opera itself as much as possible, and Columbus achieved this feat. It was a big transition, but with as big as a following as Rent has had, one of the points Columbus had to and did make was the maintaining of the original plotline. This movie achieves a message that all of us can use in our everyday life: Friendship is a thing to be valued, and never taken for granted...friends will be there for you, through thick and thin.",1143331200,,2169,4.472222222222222
2717322,5,B000LXH0AY,"First off, I have never seen the on stage musical version of Rent like most people who have reviewed this movie so I cannot compare. No one had really told me what it was about so I rented it unknowing of what I was really going to be watching, I knew it was a musical and thats it.

Ive noticed that some of the people who commented on the movie were dissing it because they said it was a movie only for gay people. I am a married twenty three year old woman and I have two kids. Im as straight as they come.

I loved the opening song, Seasons of Love. When Mark and Roger started singing the song about rent though, I have to admit I wasn't diggin it too much. My mind started to stray.. Well maybe I won't like this movie.. maybe i'll turn it off.  But I continued to watch it.

Then when Roger began to sing about April in Glory I saw the depth of what the movie was expressing and I got interested. Then when MiMi knocked on the boys' apartment door and began to sing Would you light my candle to Roger.. I got hooked. I sat there intrigued listening to all the lyrics of all the songs. Then you meet Angel. Angel is a cross dressrer. Angel's character is charasmatic and upbeat even though she is dying of aids.

The friendship that this group of friends shares is amazing. Some of them have aids, one is a stripper, and a few of them have experimented with drugs. They are all learning how  meaningful life is and to live life as if each moment is your last.

Which brings me back to the title of my review: No day but today: in translation: Live your life to the fullest. I laughed during Angel's dance scene after the mishap with Evita the Akita and cried when Collins sang I'll cover you at Angel's funeral.

This movie would probably be more meaningful to some one in their twenties to early thirties. Younger ones may not be able to absorb everything hat this movie represents.

This movie is great. Don't let people with negative reviews turn you off to it. Open up your mind and give it a try. Even if you watch the begginning and start to think 'this isn't for me' ..like I did.. don't turn it off. Watch the whole thing through.. Or atleast until when Angel passes away.

2717323,5,B000LXH0AY,"Having waited ages for this movie to be released in the UK I could wait no longer so bought the DVD from the states. Worth the wait? Definitely. The movie story is true to the stage show but loses a couple of songs (Christmas Bells being the most obvious missing).

What I really liked about the movie that differentiates it from the stage version is the ability to place the scenes in real life locations. The best of which was the tear-jerking funeral scene for Angel in a beautiful sun-lit church. My wife (who never saw Rent on stage) was crying all through I'll Cover You B.

The acting is first rate and you still get goose bumps from Light my Candle, tingles up your spine from Another Day and sheer enjoyment from La Vie Boheme, live in the Live Cafe - incredible scenes.

DVD Extras - There is a full length documentary on the history of Rent with loads about Jonathan Larson, very interesting and quite poignant. I never realised that Ali, Pam, Sue and Gordon were all real friends of Larson's who died of AIDS.

Overall - highly recommended - worthy of anyones money and you will watch again and again. It will tide me over until next time I'm in NYC and can get to the Nederlander.

The music is great, the cast are great, sure, it's a derpressing topic or bunch of topics at best, and the music is such a huge disjointed juxtaposition to the cast of characters' situations, but it works, and it is entertaining.

I love the movie RENT. I've watched it a bunch of times, and I love the music. I don't love the acting, I don't love the direction. The scenery is great, the sets perfect. Chris Columbus gives us such a strerile, clean-cut version of this gritty musical, and he takes away any sense of the original's 'urban sensibility'.

My point is this: RENT is a bit of a funny beast. Everyone has a situation that the everyday person would consider quite difficult. Everyone has AIDS (sorry for the Team America reference...), or is unemployed (but not willing to work), or is addicted to drugs. So, of course, the obvious thing to do would be to sing and dance. I know, it's obvious, it's a musical, but there's not one reference to prevention, only a fleeting reference to medication/rehabilitation, and one thinly veiled symbol of contraception.

I love the music. The soundtrack is fantastically produced and sounds magnificent, the film looks great, but unfortunately lacks a certain filmic smoothness needed to acheive the realness to allow us to truly suspend disbelief.

I love the music in RENT, and that's pretty much it.

5 stars for the soundtrack, 2 stars for the movie.",1143244800,,1575,4.688405797101449
2717328,5,B000LXH0AY,"I have always been a big fan of the play and soundtrack (with the original cast), so I was quite impartial when first watching this movie. At first, I was disappointed that some songs had been cut out (Contact, Christmas Bells) and the plot has been restructured to fit a movie timeline. Some more of the plot makes sense (Mimi and Angel's relationship) while some details have been trimmed out. Regardless, I ended up loving the movie after watching it again.

The music is great! Rosario Dawson does a superb job as Mimi, and I love the original cast--Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Jesse Martin, etc. The film was filled with such vibrance and life. I loved every part about it!

I think the reason this has received a few negative reviews, both by people and critics, is because its being compared to the play. I think that filming it gives some tools for the director to expand upon it (like with the scene with Joanne and Mark, ""Tango Maureen"") and Columbus really capitalized on this. Yes, its not exactly the play, but I'd argue it achieves the same message. I think this is a wonderful complement to the play, though I'm not sure how those who haven't seen the play would like the movie on it's own.",1143072000,,1204,4.543778801843318
2717329,3,B000LXH0AY,"Rent is of course the broadway musical thats been around for a long time because its the longest running musical on Broadway.

Adam Pascal (School of Rock, SLC Punk!) plays Roger who's a struggling musician who falls in love with stripper/drug junkie Mimi, played by Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Alexander). Jesse L.

Fantastic shots of New York, streets, underground etc. etc. and the performances are great especially by Rapp, Heredio and Menzel...the protest rally scene with her was great. Dawson and Thoms weren't in the regular broadway shows and they take the places of other people but they both do wonderful jobs here. The songs are great, sometimes cornish which is basically in the musical vein. ""The Tango Maureen"" sequence was one of the best and so was ""La Vie Boheme"". This one won't disappoing Rent fans. I've never seen Rent on Broadway but the movie was a winner all on its own. I just want to point this out...it seemed like they put Bon Jovi in the movie (Adam Pascal) heh heh.

It sends a powerful message to the rest of the world about AIDS/HIV. I am trying to get others to see it but I live in a reddneck town. RENT won't even think about coming to Tallahassee. Season of Love has to be one of the best in my opinion. I did not like ""One Song"" though. Everything else was great. I read about people comparing the movie to the play. However, amazon and the rest of the U.S. needs to know that some of us do not have the opportunity to see the musical. Perfect Cast hands downs. A MUST SEE.

2717331,5,B000LXH0AY,"When tickets to the show Rent first went on sale, I knew I had to purchased them for our family.  By then we were all familiar with the story fo Joanthan Larson who wrote the show and tragically died before the show even opened.  Legends esepcially on Broadway are made of stories like these but for me there was a more perosnal reason to see this show.  Having grown up in the East Village I was familiar with the area and the people who both lived and worked there.  But for several reasons I was disappointed with the show although I loved the music and purchased the album. Then I read a movie based on the show was being made and when I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this again.  I seriously wondered how they would capture the essence of Manhattan and the high energy of the performers. But I didn't have to wonder for long.  From the first scene with the 8 principal actos standing on stage singing Seasons of Love, I knew I was in for a movie treat. Not only did I enjoy the movie, I loved it and plan to purchase it so I can watch it again and again.

Based on the opera La Boheme, Rent tells the story of a group of young people living, loving and dying in the area of Manhattan called the East Village.  Known as the hub of the 60's movement 40 odd years ago, in recent years the area became known for squatters and disenchanted young adults. For me, familiar with the area, the movie had all of the energy of this part of Manhattan and the lives of those who live there.

Focusing on 8 individuals that included Angel, a drag queen with AIDS, his lover Tom to Maureen a performance artist and finally to Marc, a filmmaker who in the end captured their story for all times.  While the show was loud and at times I felt the performers were shouting over the music, the film was beautifully conceived and allowed the listener to make sense of the words.  The actors, most of them from the Broadway

show, were excellent. With the exception of The Sound of Music and Chicago it is rare that I think a movie based on a Broadway musical is better.  But in the case of the movie Rent, I loved every minute of this movie and was sorry to see it end.  The music so poignant continues to play in my head and I am sure the late Jonathan Larson must be smiling down from heaven to see how well this movie was made by Chris Columbus. While the subject matter is difficult at times and at the very least gripping and poignant, I suggest this movie to all who would enjoy seeing an excellent film.",1142899200,,2501,4.205020920502092

2717334,2,B000LXH0AY,"Musicals (and Operas) aren't my forte - although I did enjoy CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE - so I was hesitant to check out RENT. But after reading about its notable comparisons to La Boheme, and how consumption was replaced by HIV/AIDS, I was intrigued enough to pick up a copy and find out what director Chris Columbus (what an unfortunate name) did with it.

I guess I should've stuck with my original movie-musical/opera instincts.

RENT is exactly what it claims to be, a musical; and perhaps a bit too much of one. At every opportunity - whether it seems justifiable or not - the cast breaks out into song. I know, I know. It's a musical. What did I expect?

Maybe I've been spoiled by the two aforementioned postmodern musicals. CHICAGO AND MOULIN ROUGE told stories through both good narratives and great songs. And they didn't force-feed the audience musical number after musical number after musical number. Let me explain further ...

RENT is a modern parable about bohemians living in New York's East Village. They're either all struggling artists, lovers, or victims of the HIV epidemic ...or, sometimes, they're all three (depending on which character you choose to follow). They all live in a substandard building and are having trouble paying the rent (begin opening chorus here). Anthony Rapp stars as Mark Cohen, a failed movie-maker who's coming to terms with the loss of his overtly sexy - and apparently bisexual - girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel). He's also been filming all of his friends lives and it is this that gives most of the movie its emotional weight. Adam Pascal plays Roger, Mark's roommate. Roger is dealing with his HIV status by remaining a shut-in after having lost a girlfriend to AIDS. But then Mimi (Rosario Dawson) moves in downstairs and Roger is tempted to fall in love again. But his HIV status and his broken heart keep them apart ...in addition to the fact that Mimi is a drug addict and is HIV positive, too. Jesse L. Martin plays Tom Collins (ha-ha), an out of work MIT instructor who returns to the Village to find his friends self-destructing and, amazingly, to find love in the arms of another HIV positive man, Angel (played by an excellent Wilson Jermaine Heredia).

It is Angel - I think - that is supposed to represent the glue that holds these ragtag bohemians together, but we see so little of him (up until the hospital scenes where he's dying) that this aspect was nearly lost on me.

There are some decent film moments. Some of the more memorable ones (for me) were during the opening when the power to the building they're all living in is shut off and everyone burns something to stay warm, then throws the burning embers out the windows of this multi-story structure (nice imagery). I also liked the scenes involving the HIV support group that showed its members gradually disappearing, a reminder to viewers that HIV tends to be fatal to a huge percentage of those that become infected.

But the songs just couldn't hold the movie together. Most of them had the exact same tempo (with the exception of maybe one or two) and blurred or blended together, making me not really care what they were singing about. And with a musical so packed full of songs, that's pretty bad.",1142467200,,3232,4.730017761989343
2717335,5,B000LXH0AY,"This movie is a perfect specimen of what a musical gone movie should look like.  This movie is very powerful with wonderful vocals  and a life changing storyline that touches the viewers heart.  I am watching this movie for the first time, without hearing the original broadway musical and I am telling you that this movie is perhaps the most entertaining and inspirational movie I have seen in a long time. The acting is great and the energy that is presented is felt right thought the screen. Great movie!!!!!",1142294400,,511,4.719101123595506
2717336,5,B000LXH0AY,"I am still not yet to the point where I have grown tired of watching my favorite parts of this musical (or listening to them when I am driving in my car and away from my DVD players).  Ironically the touring company was next door in Wisconsin when the movie came out on DVD, but it will be back in a couple of weeks and I have tickets to go see it, even though it means driving from the shores of one Great Lake to another, because I really want to see what the show is like on stage.  What I do know at this point is that I like the music more than the characters, and the soundtrack more than the original cast album, although the legion of Rentheads out there may be horrified by such sentiments.  But then I never really related to the original Bohemian characters in Puccini's opera either.  I swear that Roger (Adam Pascal) looks like Moebius the Living-Vampire from Marvel comics and I cannot get past that idea. I should be able to identify with would-be filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), but I like his ability to tango more than the cinematic style of his work.  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is sexy, but dying, and Joanee (Tracie Thoms) and Maureen (Idina Menzel) cannot wholly commit to the idea that opposites attract. As for Benjamin (Taye Diggs), the dude is definitely slumming.

The characters that I really care about are Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) because I think they best represent love amongst this group of friends.  I know that Mimi and Roger are supposed to be the main couple (""Light My Candle""), and that Maureen and Joanne are a truly combustible couple (""Take Me or Leave Me""), but the real love story is Angel and Collins and when I reduce the dynamic of ""Rent"" to a pair of songs I point to ""I'll Cover You"" and its reprise.  So even when logic dictates that this movie should be rated at 4.5 at best, I think of that final shot in the film of Angel and I have to round up become of its poignancy (the alternative ending, the smile on Tom's face when Angel walks by and holds his hand for a minute is almost as transcendent).

Turning some of the songs into dialogue so it is not wall-to-wall singing was not necessary from my perspective. I am perfectly willing to listen to musicals or operas that are music and all singing from start to finish. Still, I appreciate the attempt to give the story a bit more dramatic weight by doing so.  Ultimately, what is so appealing about the music in ""Rent"" are the harmonies, as amply demonstrated by ""Seasons of Love.""  Ultimately, the emotions matter more than the words. Is ""La Boheme"" any less effective because most of us do not know precisely what they are singing? After all, one of the most famous arias in the opera is Colline saying goodbye to his coat. When ""Life Support,"" ""Will I"" and ""Another Day"" combine at the end to make up ""Finale B,"" the lyrics are simplistic, but the emotional effect is (here comes the word again) transcendent, even compared to something like the sextet from ""Lucia di Lammermoor."" In other words, the sound and fury signify a lot in ""Rent,"" and if in the end it all comes down to love that is not exactly a bad thing. Plus, with the six voices at the end (eight if you do the alternative version), I think most of us can find a vocal part to sing along with well within our comfort range, not that it stops us from switching parts and trying to be more ambitious. Larson also provides so many different types of songs that every couple of songs something in a style you really like comes along.

I really like the soundtrack more than the original cast recording. Of course, six of the original cast are here, so I should point out that not only do I think that those six have brought a decade's worth of experiencing singing these songs to their performances but that the two newbies add something to the mix. Martin's ""Santa Fe"" and reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" evidence a great deal more depth as he puts his younger self to shame.  One my favorite vocal moments is in ""Goodbye Love"" when the voices of the two newcomers, Dawson and Thoms, blend and power through, ""I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had, someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you."" The biggest heresy would be that I like the way ""Finale B"" is played straight for the emotional impact of Mimi's revival instead of the mock deus ex machina of the original (off) Broadway production.

Again, I realize that those who have seen the musical can hold the exact opposite position and I fully appreciate that seeing the show live, especially songs like ""Over the Moon,"" is something different from this film. Beyond that, producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with Green Day, did a great job of updating the sound for the 21st century. As for director Chris Columbus, it taking this particular musical to the streets he did not make it to the sacred heights of ""West Side Story,"" but I think ""Rent"" works a lot better than the likes of ""Hair"" and ""Godspell"" on the big scream.  Several of his montages, most notably for ""Without You,"" are quite effective, but I understand that some fans will not be able to get beyond the fact ""Goodbye Love"" is relegated to the deleted scenes.  The bottom line is that my affection for this movie is based more on the ear connected to the heart than the eye linked to the brain, and I will just leave it at that.  I certainly understand why so many people find ""Rent"" so profoundly moving.",1142208000,,5455,4.444444444444445

Jonathon Larson's intriguing story of the life of a group of Bohemian friends living in NYC in the late 80's struggling to find money to pay their rent and to find true love.  Amidst their struggles, most of the characters develop AIDS, and learn along with audiences to ""measure your life in love.""  This story is based on love and loss.  The characters learn to treasure each day with the people they love because before you know it, they may no longer be with you.

 Under the direction of Chris Columbus, this movie is perfectly cast and performed in a touching manner.  The actors portray their roles in such a believable way that they almost become the characters.  You become so attached to the performances of Mimi (Rosario Dawson), Roger (Adam Pascal), and Collins (Jesse L. Martin.)  I could feel the energy and friendship of the cast right through the screen.

 The phenomenal voices of the cast were coupled with a unique music score.  This music was updated from show tunes to pop-rock masterpieces which fit together like a puzzle to form a story and give each character a distinct and very different personality.

2717343,5,B000LXH0AY,"RENT was/is a musical driven by the songs of the characters, not the scenery.  The songs have regained their energy, and so the movie drove me to tears even more than the Broadway show (which I have seen a few times with different casts).  The movie isn't the show, but I can't blame it for not being what it cannot be.

The ""bonus disc"" is worth the price of the movie.  The deletion of the song ""Goodbye, Love"" was a crime (naming a chapter of the movie ""Goodbye, Love"" added insult to injury), and I watch the song in the ""deleted scenes"" part of the bonus disc more than the movie.  Another decision was the ending: I much prefer the alternate ending that is on the bonus disc.

Critically, the movie just isn't as stark as what the stage version presents.  The buildings are a bit too clean, the central characters look too put-together.  The Bohemians are too Fifth Avenue, not Avenue C.  As movie adaptations of musicals go, this is one of the better ones.  I appreciate how the camera angles force me to see reaction shots from characters - on Broadway, you tend to look at the person singing.  The movie forces me at times to focus on a character's reaction to what is being sung, which enhances the song.

As for the homophobic comments that have been posted in some earlier reviews, they speak for themselves.  Their message of hate is exactly what RENT speaks against.  As a Presbyterian minister, the scene of Angel's funeral represented a sincere and God-honoring faith that is often missing from our churches.

In the end, the movie accomplishes for me what the show did on an emotional level: it simultaneously gives me a feeling of hope, an appreciation for life and the desire to live each day to the fullest, AND a renewed commitment to remember the less fortunate among us.

For those people who like musicals this is a must-own.  And no, it's NOT a gay film by any means.  The film focuses on 2 gay couples, 1 straight couple and 1 straight single man.  But, more importantly, this is a show about friendship and courage in the face of a terrible disease.

Then I watched it with my father, who is a true 60's baby boomer, he loved the opening song RENT, and the other rockers, but the whole plotline went over his head since he was in a differen't generation. Then I saw it with my grandparents who hated it, not to offend anyone, but my grandparents are old and from a differn't generation, a generation where the term 'colored' is perfectably acceptable in general soceity, so every time Collins (my personal favorite charecter) came on, they said, ""ooh, theres the colored person"" they hated it, my grandmother said that she thought that these people should at least learn a leasson, and I say, well, I think they have, I mean, its not Roger and Mark's fault that Benny broke his fault, and its not like everything's perfect, these people get punished for their bad decissions just like real people, infact, this is one of the only musicals that really emphasises on this. I mean one chareceter dies and another charecter probably won't make it 10 days after the end of the film if it were to continue, so its not happy, it IS uplifting.

As someone who grew up in the ghettos of San Francisco in the late 80's, I was extremly lucky to dodge the AIDS epidemic when it was a death sentance, although I did live it, so I relate myself to Mark, who doesn't have AIDS, but symphasizes with those who do. In fact, just a week before I saw the stageplay for the first time (1999) my good friend was pronounced HIV+, so this hit me hard.

So my point is, to enjoy this, you really have to have grown up and lived the experience of the late 80's, it hits hardest if you can relate to it.",1141948800,,1765,4.361702127659575

I saw the Broadway show for the first time on the 10 year anniversary because I had to see it onstage before the movie came out. I am so glad I did. I didn't know the plotline before I saw it and I literally cried for twenty minutes in the middle of Times Square after leaving the theatre. I couldn't even listen to disc two of the cast recording, for weeks, without crying. The scenes that they left out of the movie should have been left in. It would have added a whole ten minutes to the running time but they were so important to telling the whole story. I don't think I can sit through another viewing of this movie. If you want to know what the Broadway musical was like, buy the original broadway cast recording. It is exactly how the show runs, with little talk and so much more singing. It also gives you the whole story with all the emotion that should be in the movie. If you haven't seen RENT in the theater, the whole show is done with only one set. It's great!!",1141948800,,1055,4.151219512195122
2717350,4,B000LXH0AY,"When I rented the Rent DVD I was oblivious to any story, music and characters. I did know it was a Broadway show at one time. But that was about it. I sure was in for a surprise when I played this DVD.

Rent takes a one year look into New York's East Village bohemians. These carefree artists face constant struggles during the late 1980s. The story's focus is on these two main characters; Mark (Anthony Rapp) an aspiring filmmaker that will just about anything that is not main stream and his roommate is Roger (Adam Pascal) an aspiring songwriter. Shuffle in the many friends who are intertwined in the story of love, sex, drugs, art and friendship.

This DVD musical must be played with a Home Theatre System with Dolby Digital surround sound. The songs come alive with visual art portrayed by the actors/singers. The content hits the heart of its viewer. The dialog is crisp, clear and to the point when sung.

The surprise for me is that I actually will add this DVD to my collection because of the songs. But now I actually know the story behind the music. I will always have Mimi (Rosario Dawson) in my mind during the ""Out Tonight"" performance at the Catscratch Club. Wow!

Reviewers- Please stop trying to compare film and show experiences. Rentheads go to the theatre. Film enthusiasts purchase this DVD musical. Comparison is futile. Or you will be assimilated in a wash!",1141862400,,1383,4.63265306122449

2717352,5,B000LXH0AY,"There's been a lot already said in the reviews here, so I won't go into most things. Just a few things that I want to mention. I was hoping that when they finally released this show, it would be a film of the stage production. When I found out it was to be a movie, my first reaction was disappointment. But now that I've seen it, I am very pleased. The loft set is so close to the stage set that you almost feel like you are in the theatre. And I saw the whole original cast at the Nederlander in NYC one week after they won the Tony for best musical (highlight of my life!). Daphne Rubin Vega is missed here - her rendition of Without You was, to me, stronger than Dawson's. But Dawson is still good. Another of my favorite musicals is The Producers, and I was quite disappointed with the film adaptation of that one. All the acting felt pushed and over the top. Not so with Rent. You can feel the connection that these cast members have with each other after years of doing the show together. Very powerful performances. Of course, I did have to laugh at the 'resurrection' of Mimi! One minute, she appears to have died, and 30 seconds later, she is sitting up and going on like nothing happened! And the Director and Cast commentary is very informative and entertaining.",1141776000,,1274,4.334728033472803
2717353,3,B000LXH0AY,"I loved Rent when I saw it on stage, and I could probably play the original cast recording back in my head start to finish without prompting. So I was really looking forward to the movie.  Immagine my disappointment when I actually saw what came out.  A lot of the music had been left out, with musical dialogue turned in to spoken dialogue, seemingly at random.  I bought the DVD because half a Rent is better than no Rent at all, but it could have been so much more.  I had the same reaction to Phantom of the Opera.  As a fan of the play, I think it would have been better if they had simply set a video camera in the third row of the orchestra and taped a performance right off the stage.  All the extra production that went into the movie took away from the play and didn't add anything.",1141603200,,792,4.143790849673203

You know every word to every song, every move in ""La Vie Boheme""...... but the movie, which was strongly inticipated....... just fell short. It wasn't good enough for RENT. what i did enjoy was that it made the people real. They were in a real subway, a real cafe, a real apartment, but thats just about it. Im glad the kept the original broadway cast, that was very wise, but sorry Mr. Collumbus, it just fell short.

Will hollywood ever be able to adapt a current broadway musical to the big screen, and do it well?

the only one that worked was Chicago. RENT and Phantom just aren't doing it for me.",1141516800,,698,4.320610687022901
2717355,5,B000LXH0AY,"Thank goodness Rent made it to the big screen. I hadn't been fortunate enough to see it until now. I will be the first to say that because of the subject matter (it is about a bohemian lifestyle, after all so what does one expect?) it's not for everyone. I would classify myself as fairly conservative -- conservative values, Christian, etc. and again, I classify Rent as an outstanding work. I cared about these characters without judgment and condemnation and challenge others who would avoid this movie because of the subject matter to be open-minded to the human beings (regardless of whether or not you agree with lifestyles, etc.). It has the potential to change your life, and increase your compassion toward others. That may sound a bit melodramatic, but it is true.

OK...off my soap box.

What a thrill it is for me to see this Broadway cast portray their very same roles on the big screen. The soundtrack is incredible (which I purchased after seeing the movie in the theater) as well. And be sure you don't miss thie extras as the deleted scenes (and alternate ending) are gems, but the true bonus is the 2-hour documentary about Jonathan Larson's life and the story of Rent. It's inspiring and heartbreaking. We can only imagine what else Jonathan would have gifted us with had he lived. Thank you Jonathan Larson!",1141516800,,1327,4.740259740259741
2717356,5,B000LXH0AY,"I absolutely love RENT. It is an amazing story that is provacative, witty, and wonderful. It is great on stage but loses some of the best stuff on the big screen. Most of the music was cut out of the movie, and even 2/3 of the emotional overload ""Goodbye Love"". But it could have been much, much worse.

Many people would have felt that Spike Lee would have made a more adequet director than Chris Columbus. I don't really think that is true. Chris Columbus tried his best and pushed the cast beyond their limits, if you noticed in the film there are significant parts where there is no cut for a very long time. I personally think that Spike Lee would have been a horrible director. He wanted to cast Justin Timberlake as Roger!! That would ruin everything for me and many other RENTheads. If anything Chris Columbus did the film and the characters some justice the only way that he could, by getting the original cast members.

The cast still has some of its old groove. Although older there a little wiser and have better voices. Adam Pascal can still send shivers down the spine. And although that Daphne Rubin-Vega had a little rasp in her voice, I still miss it over Rosario Dawson's. And as much I hate to admit it but the addition of Tracie Thoms was a better choice then Fredi Walker, the original Joanne (hear that high note!)

As a musician myself the songs are amazing and intricate, and hold a lot of meaning.

Although the movie was really good, it was missing some key things that it good, and how i feel in love with it in the first place. And even though i love the movie, i would choose the musical live over it any day.

Now for anyone who loved RENT, and liked or is interested in seeing the Broadway production, please visit this site. Trust me its worth it!!

2717357,5,B000LXH0AY,"I loved this movie!  But I stress that it is not for everyone!  It is for a more open minded croud.  I see some horrible review's about this movie that are not actually about the movie but about the subject matter.  If you can't handle the subjects in the film, then you should not be watching it.

It was a good film, but there was room for improvement.  I saw the show on broadway and I understand why they had to cut some stuff from the movie...it would not have been as fluid.  I believe the standout performance in the film was Adam Pascal.  His voice is beautiful!  The funeral scene was hard to watch for his acting alone was breathtaking.

Again I say that it is a good film for people with open minds...but if you are not open to people who are different then don't watch it.  If you are a person who is open to the way people are then this film is for you.  The music is fun.  The acting is great!

It's wonderful seeing most of the origional broadway cast playing the roles that made them who thay are today.

2717358,1,B000LXH0AY,"I rented this film after having listened to my high school students rave about how great it was, and boy, do I wish I had my money back.  This very well could be the worst film I've ever seen.

First, the characters are detestable.  They are angry at their former friend because he expects them to pay rent.  Paying bills is what grownups do...why do they feel they should be exempt?  Additionally, they are rude to everyone they meet.  As a struggling college student, I worked many low-paying jobs in the service industry, and I was far more able to put myself in the employees' shoes while watching the main characters trash a restaurant.  Maybe if they weren't trying so hard to be shocking and provocative, they might have time to be happy-- or at the very least-- find a job and pay the rent.  I've experienced poverty firsthand, and it doesn't look anything like what was portrayed in the film.

Second, the writing was sophomoric.  Many of the songs seemed like tuneless narration of the plot.  I muttered ""You've got to be kidding"" in reaction to the dialogue multiple times throughout the film and must admit that I fast-forwarded through a good portion of the songs.  For instance, Rosario Dawson's character is supposedly near death at one point, and her love interest sings, ""Don't leave me alone with my guitar.""  Egad.  A good musical has you humming the tunes long after you've finished watching it, but I found all of these utterly forgettable.

Third, the film is supposed to be set in 1989. Anachronisms abound!  Only one character is dressed appropriately for the time period, but because he is the only one thus attired he just looks like the group's unfashionable friend.

If you want to see a meaningful film about AIDS, see Philadelphia.  If you want to see a harrowing account of heroin addiction, see Trainspotting. If you want a heartbreaking tale of someone struggling with sexual identity, see Boys Don't Cry.  If you want characters attempting to claw their way out of poverty in search of stardom, see Hoop Dreams, Coal Miner's Daughter, or if you're very brave-- Requiem for a Dream.  If you want an amazing love story that triumphs over adversity, see Walk the Line.  This film attempts to address all these issues and fails miserably.",1141430400,,2268,4.749360613810742
2717359,5,B000LXH0AY,"I've been a RentHead since I first saw the show in 1997. I think the movie was very well done, and I just purchased the 2 disc special edition. There is a documentary about Jonathan Larson on the bonus disc called No Day But Today that is just amazing. It tells Jonathans story of how he began, all of his other projects, and all he went through just to get Rent to the stage. Its full of commentary from his friends, family, and the original cast. It takes you all the way through his tragic death on opening night, right up to the making of the motion picture. If you are a true fan of Rent you will love it. The documentary made me cry about 4 or 5 times.",1141430400,,658,4.069230769230769
2717360,3,B000LXH0AY,"I do not like to be one of those critics that immediately denounces this film because of the popularity surrounding the Broadway hit.  I hope that with this review I do not sound like it, but there were some harsh occurrences that I cannot ""let slide"", while others say they were ""golden"".  There is a very big difference between this film version and that which I saw on stage. Sure, I didn't see the one in New York City (enjoyed the one in London), but there is something unique, absolute, and powerful about seeing a stage version of a musical instead of in the comfort of your own couch.  I don't believe that I am saying this, but I think that you have more originality on stage.  Imagination is your greatest tool, and you can also take certain justices when performing in front of a live audience that you cannot in cinema.  This was a big hurdle to have to cross with the film version of Rent.  Again, I don't want to just compare and contrast the film to play, but there was a level of imagination and originality lost in the cinematic version.  Instead of dreaming of what New York City was like on stage, director Chris Columbus spoon-feeds it to you.  You could literally turn off your mind for this film and still find some slivers of entertainment, but was it the right entertainment?  The music was phenomenal, it was impressive to see the original cast (of which I have listened to their original Broadway CD for years now), and there was some interesting points that Columbus chose to keep, and others that he chose to delete.  You cannot recreate the imagination of the theater with a film.  Shocked to hear myself say that, but it is true.  There is something about smelling the person next to you and ""Mooing"" with the tourist on the other side.  That is was I missed the most about Rent the film.

Again (and I apologize), but much like the play I loved the beginning of Rent.  I initially felt that Columbus was going to successfully pull it off.  He was going to bring back the age-old cinema trick of bringing original casts back together to film on a bigger scale.  Opening with our entire cast singing the powerful ""Seasons of Love"" to an open stage, I nearly broke into tears at that moment.  I saw Columbus going in a very creative direction, and I must admit the opening scene pulled me in.  Then, nearly word for word, song for song, he slowly began to befuddle it.  Just like the play, for the first half of the film, I think Columbus (and the cast) did a very convincing job.  The songs provoked intimate memories, the struggle of life coupled with the power of love shined through, and the independence of living in a huge city like NYC in the late 80s was reborn.  The familiar faces of the cast and the crispness of the songs demonstrated how big this Broadway hit was.  Columbus took some creative control, which I did not complain with.  His change on ""Tango: Maureen"" I thought was a prediction of what he was going to do with the other songs, but alas, that creativity stopped there.  Columbus tried hard, but ultimately, after finishing this film, I do not think he was the best director to helm this project.  I didn't want Rent to be as gritty as Angels in America, yet I didn't want it to be as candy-coated as I witnessed it with Columbus.  Character's hair were never tangled or messed up, money again didn't seem to be an issue, and apparently throwing fire into the streets is not a problem in NYC.  I realize that Columbus was attempting to capture the inherit history of the musical with these scenes, but we are living in a Hollywood of realism.  Rent is a real story, I didn't want it to feel like it was ""faked"".  By the end of this film, I had felt that Columbus had ""faked"" me.

One aspect of this film that really appealed to me was the return of the original cast.  That was a superb decision made by Columbus (and probably DeNiro) that was successfully able to keep some of the original emotion from the stage version.  Rosario Dawson annoyed me throughout the film, but outside of that I felt the original cast did a fantastic job.  I especially enjoyed Jesse L. Martin's ""Tom Collins"" character.  There was so much emotion, so much passion behind his eyes when he spoke that you could not help but immediately love his character.  One could say the same about Angel.  Anthony Rapp, sadly, seemed angry the entire time about something.  Even as he sang of love, his beady little eyes seemed dark and hollow.  I think he missed the aura of his character.  I, shockingly, also believed that Tracie Thoms did a fantastic job with her character, creating just enough chemistry as well as stern independence to bounce off Idina Menzel (in my opinion stole the show).  Taye Diggs, well, he was Taye Diggs.  Yet, it is due to these key players that I was able to watch this film until the end.  I do not think this film could have been done without these original players back in the roles that rocketed them into the spotlight.

I have some friends that have seen the stage version of Rent and listened to the original Broadway cast CD and complain about this film.  It may seem like I am doing the same, but I am not complaining, just feeling a bit disappointed.  My friends claim that this film just doesn't work in today's society because of the growing awareness of AIDS and medicine's ability to combat the drug.  They also whine about the aging actors that were once in their 20s performing this same song and dance routine.  I do not agree with any of these comments at all.  This is a film/play that does not feel dated to me.  It still feels alive due to the suffering in this country surrounding AIDS.  Rent is able to do something that other films seem to continually forget to capture, and that is friendship.  Rent is about friends, no matter how old they are, always being there for you.  It is about having your own independence, while being surrounded by those that accept it.  It is about overcoming hardships with the help of these friends.  It is about living your life as if it were your last.  Rent's themes are relevant today, just as they were ten years ago.

Overall, I thought this was a mediocre film release.  There could have been better moments (the ending could have been less Hollywood), yet what countered this was the music, which was phenomenal.  Columbus' idea to bring the original cast back was a bold and creative move in my eyes.  I agree that Rent should have been made into a film, but (while he had his ups and downs) I do not think Columbus was the best decision to helm this project.  I am excited that I watched this film, but I think I would rather see another staged version of Rent before I see the version on film again.

2717361,3,B000LXH0AY,"That's what performance artist Maureen tries to get her audience to say in her one-woman show protesting her landlord. But it describes the music, too - much of it comprises overblown show-rock that sounds like it came from The Lost Meat Loaf Tapes. ""Moo,"" indeed.

The movie is set in 1989-90 but only one character, the hapless Bon Jovi wannabe Roger, actually takes on the thankless task of looking like he was from that era - everyone else appears up-to-date.

On the plus side, there's a nice, comfy vibe between the actors. It's not as self-consciously big-budget/star-power as ""Chicago,"" but neither is it as clever or catchy. If you're not interested in an adrenaline rush, ""Rent"" is the movie-musical for you - conflict is minimal.

Special features include a commentary by Chris Columbus, Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp.  Columbus offers some interesting insight into directorial choice, but Rapp and Pascal steal the show with a delightful banter that casts a new light on the film-making process and the tight bond of this wonderful cast.

I would probably never have been able to see this incredible show on the stage.  Thank God that Revolution Studios made this great musical available as a movie.

I can only say that for me, this movie is life changing.  Since I received it five days ago, I have watched it at least seven times!  Seeing this movie has really opened my eyes towards people who are considered outcasts or disenfranchised by society - gays, tran-gendered, homeless, poor, those with AIDS, those struggling with addiction.  Watching RENT showed me how all of them are just PEOPLE like myself, trying to overcoming the tough parts of life with sensitivity and love.

This show is especially popular with young people.  I think that they realize better that the rest of us how ALL of us are disenfranchised by the current world system.  Watching RENT is an affirmation of all that is good about being human.

I saw the stage performance once in 1999 and fell in love with Rent madly.  I've worn out three CD's in the 6 years since listening to the soundtrack in the hopes to see it again.

Of course the magic of the stage is hard to transfer to the big screen, I have yet to see a Broadway production that went to film and was considered better than the original.  Yes, some items were cut and some things were left for the deleted scenes, but I think the film capture, maybe even better than could be shown on stage, a lot of the minor details and subtlties of the show.  Especially with the enviorment it presented.

As for the DVD as a whole, the 2nd disc is something not to be missed.  I knew a vague history behind the origin of the story and Jonathan Larson, but after watching the documentary, the story in Rent opened up a lot more.

2717379,5,B000LXH0AY,"To say after watching the movie version of ""Rent"" that I like the musical more than the movie is a strange comment to make because I have not (yet) seen the award-winning show on stage (ironically, the touring company has been next door in Wisconsin this week, but driving eight hours to see it tonight seems like a big much even to me).  But I know that I like the music more than the characters and fully admit that the fault is in my self more than in Jonathan Larson's creations; I just cannot relate to the people in that time and place the way so many Rentheads have and in my defense will point out I did not relate to the original Bohemians in Puccini's opera either.  I swear that Roger (Adam Pascal) looks like Moebius the Living-Vampire from Marvel comics and I cannot get past that idea.  I should be able to identify with would-be filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), but I like his ability to tango more than his cinematic style.  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is sexy, but dying, and Joanee (Tracie Thoms) and Maureen (Idina Menzel) cannot wholly commit to the idea that opposites attract.  As for Benjamin (Taye Diggs), the dude is definitely slumming.  The characters that I really care about are Tom (Jesse L. Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) because I think they represent the brain and heart of this group of friends, and even when logic dictates that this movie should be rated at 4.5 at best, I think of that final shot in the film of Angel and I have to round up become of its poignancy.  Even with the alternative ending, the smile on Tom's face when Angel walks by and holds his hand for a minute is almost as transcendent.

Turning some of the songs into dialogue so it is not wall-to-wall singing was not necessary from my perspective.  I am perfectly willing to listen to musicals or operas that are music and all singing from start to finish, with or without recitatives.  In fact, I think that what is so appealing about the music in ""Rent"" are the harmonies, not only of the voices as amply demonstrated by ""Seasons of Love,"" but also between the voices and the music.  Ultimately, there is a sense that the emotions matter more than the words.  Is ""La Boheme"" any less effective because most of us do not know precisely what they are singing?  After all, one of the most famous arias in the opera is Colline saying goodbye to his coat.  When ""Life Support,"" ""Will I"" and ""Another Day"" combine at the end to make up ""Finale B,"" the lyrics are rather simplistic, but the emotional effect is transcendent, even compared to something like the sextet from ""Lucia di Lammermoor.""  In other words, the sound and fury signify a lot in ""Rent,"" and if in the end it all comes down to love, then that is not exactly a bad thing.  Plus, with the six voices at the end (eight if you do the alternative version), I think most of us can find a vocal part to sing along with well within our comfort range, not that it stops us from switching parts and trying to be more ambitious.  Larson also provides an impressive range of types of songs, so every couple of songs something in a style you really like comes along.

Having been listening to the soundtrack pretty much nonstop since I sent the DVDs back, I have to say that I like it more than the original cast recording.  Of course, six of the original cast are here, so I should point out that not only do I think that those six have brought a decade's worth of experiencing singing these songs to their performances but that the two newbies add something to the mix.  Martin's ""Santa Fe"" and reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" evidence more depth, and one of the my favorite vocal moments is in ""Goodbye Love"" when Dawson and Thoms blend voices and power through, ""I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had, someone to live for, unafraid to say I love you.""  The biggest heresy would be that I like the way ""Finale B"" is played straight for the emotional impact of Mimi's revival instead of the mock deus ex machina that I hear in the (off) Broadway album.  Again, I realize that those who have seen the musical can hold the exact opposite position and I fully appreciate that seeing the show live, especially songs like ""Over the Moon,"" is something different from this film.  Beyond that, producer Rob Cavallo, known for his work with Green Day, did a great job of updating the sound for the 21st century.  As for director Chris Columbus, it taking this particular musical to the streets he did not make it to the sacred heights of ""West Side Story,"" but I think ""Rent"" works a lot better than the likes of ""Hair"" and ""Godspell.""  The bottom line is that my affection for this movie is based more on the ear connected to the heart than the eye linked to the analytical half of my brain, and I will just leave it at that.",1140912000,,4797,4.4300341296928325
2717380,3,B000LXH0AY,"What makes Rent unique is that it was the first Broadway production that put the lights on AIDS and HIV.  It is also the second show that openly depicted gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) issues on the main stage in New York, since the Broadway musical La Cage aux Folles in 1983.  A decade after its opening, Rent received its cinematic treatment.  It kept most of its original cast members from the stage, which helped bring about the same feel from the stage.  However, it does not possess the same uniqueness in the cinematic realm, as film has openly portrayed gay issues over the last 15 years through terrific films such as Maurice (1987), Philadelphia (1993), Bound (1996), Boys Don't Cry (1999), and most recently Brokeback Mountain (2005).  In addition, films such as the disturbing cult New York film Kids (1995) and the television film And the Band Played On (1993) handled the issue of HIV and AIDS even before the premiere of the stage musical.  Despite its lack of cinematic rareness, Rent still helps shed some important light on HIV/AIDS and GLBT issues, and does so through much music and song.

In the shadow of AIDS and HIV the audience gets to experience a musical with roots in Puccini's opera La boh&egrave;me, which is set in the Alphabet City of New York City.  It is a location where artists and others with non-traditional life philosophies sought refuge including myriads of poverty stricken people.  Alphabet City also suffered from drugs and violent crimes during the 1980s, which is when Rent takes place and follows the fate of eight friends and lovers.  The social setting is almost more important than the characters in the film, as the atmosphere in which they live heavily colors their political, social, economical perspective on life.

The opening shot with the eight main characters on a stage allows the audience to draw that it is a stage musical moved to a set, as they sing the Seasons of Love.  Abruptly, the imagery moves from the countdown to one of filmmaker Mark Cohen's (Anthony Rapp) 8mm films that show the gritty and poor part of New York that many want to escape.  Instead, Mark embraces it by showing it to the audience, which helps set the tone of the film.

Amidst the New York chaos, one character after another appears through song, as we get to know them as friends such as Mark's roommate Roger Davis (Adam Pascal).  He is musician struggling with coming up with the perfect song while constantly remaining in a glum state pondering the past and his acquisition of AIDS through a dirty drug needle.  They have a friend Tom Collins (Jesse L, Martin), a gay non-tenured NYU college professor with AIDS, who often stays with them at their place.  Mark and Roger also have a former friend, Benjamin Coffin III (Taye Diggs) whom they now loathe, as he has become their landlord while imposing rules and rent on them, as he sold them out by joining the aristocratic society.  Simultaneously, Mark suffers from a broken heart, as his girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) has left him for the IVY-League graduate Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Last, but certainly not least, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), a flamboyant transvestite, suffers from AIDS, but also expresses a strong affectionate love for Tom Collins that he reciprocates.  Together these eight characters go through a year of emotional ups and downs cornered by sadness, disappointments, and death which ultimately regains itself like bird Phoenix out of the ashes by spreading its wings of love.

The musical aspect attempts to carry a triumphantly poignant celebration of love and mutually painful struggle in the shadow of death and illness.  However, it is not always so easy on the ear, as it aurally provides some cinematic gracelessness.  Much of the awkwardness emerges in the story line driven by its overwhelming song and lyrics, as the audience almost never gets a chance to breath or contemplate the importance of each piece between the musical numbers.  In addition, in some instances the lyrics sound awkward through their gawky rhyming.  Besides the musical portion, the audience will also lose interest in the characters, as the film self-indulgently begins to entertain itself in the revolutionary undertones that displays by ""sticking it to the man.""  In a story where people's emotions are essential, as a viewer I almost felt cheated, because the psychological aspects of the characters were never fully portrayed in the way film only can provide.  Instead, the film leans too heavily on the music, as if it exclusively would bring about the emotional moments in the film, which makes it feel that the director Columbus never elevated the stage musical to what cinema could help create.  In the end, Rent provides a superficially intriguing musical, but never reaches the accomplishments of other contemporary film musicals such as Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Chicago (2002), or even close to the many musicals from the 1950s and 60s.",1140912000,,4972,4.950661853188929
2717381,4,B000LXH0AY,"I must confess I was skeptical that this great Broadway musical could ever resonate on film, it is so powerful in the theater, I just could not see how it would translate.  This movie works, granted is is not the same as seeing it on Broadway, but it works, and it works because Director Columbus was wise enough to get most of the original cast to recreate their roles, especially important was Pascal, I just could not imagine the film without him.  I was perplexed at first at the casting of Dawson at Mimi, but she is fantastic, you really can't take your eyes off of her.  I was also pleased to see that the original Angel is in the film, he really gets the character.  If you have any interest in the Broadway musical or just enjoy some great music then I believe you will be pleased with this film version of Rent.  Oh and buy the soundtrack it is at least as good as the original Broadway soundtrack.  I wonder what Larson would have thought of this..hummmmmmmm.",1140825600,,970,4.391061452513966
2717382,2,B000LXH0AY,"For someone who has never seen the musical performed live, I watched this movie and couldn't help thinking that something, and something VERY IMPORTANT was missing. The personality. The depth of the characters.

The movie jumped from song to song and there was no character building. The jist of RENT is to show the year in the life of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City struggling with life, love and AIDS, and the impacts they have on America. Yet, I couldn't help thinking that we really and truly didn't get to know these people. And... IMPACT on AMERICA?? I haven't the slightest clue.

Is it the filmmakers fault? Not sure. Probably not. I just think that there is SO MUCH MATERIAL HERE that gets portrayed in a stage play that was absolutely impossible to portray in a 2 hour movie.

The music is phenominal. The spirit of the film is there. The film opens up with the cast singing the wonderful song SEASON OF LOVE, and to me, from that point on, it became a hyperactive jump from one plot point to the next and never slowed down to actually let you know these people.

Adam Pascal plays Roger Davis, a former rocker, that is scarred because a former love of his life killed herself with drugs, which we see in brief flashbacks. Rosario Dawson plays Mimi Marquez who sings one of the coolest songs in the movie OUT TONIGHT. She, apparently has a problem with drugs too, but I never got the gist of that until they found her on the street dieing. Apparently, they all have AIDS, but I didn't understand that Roger and Mimi did until they went to the meeting, which they had been avoiding.

Wilson Jermaine Heredia plays a convincing drag queen named Angel Dumott Schunard. His funeral, which is supposed to be a big emotional moment of the movie, went right over my head. The reason? There was just too much ground to cover, too many stories to tell, too many characters to get to know, that we didn't get to know ANY OF THEM.

I could go on about the things in this movie, but it's just that everything was too vague and unexplored. Later in the movie, Roger decides he's leaving to go to Sante Fe. Apparently, a big deal. Everyone is sad and depressed because of this... they show about a 5 minute MTV clip of him walking through a desert singing and he's back home and everybody is SO EXCITED!

The movie wasn't bad for me because the music was bad, the music was awesome... in fact, just buy the CD... the movie was bad for me because all of the emotional impact things, the moments that will make you understand the characters and understand the troubles that they are going through are so VAGUE and UNEXPLORED, I had little to no interest in the film at all.",1140825600,,2683,4.452138492871691
2717383,4,B000LXH0AY,"Set on some of New York's meanest streets and very loosely based on Puccini's LA BOHEME with the AIDS epidemic substituted for tuberculosis, Jonathan Larson's RENT is an unexpected collage of stark visuals, memorable music and lyrics, and on-the-edge characters--and it was more than enough for the play to win a host of critical accolades, including the 1996 Pulitzer Price for Dramatic literature, an honor only rarely awarded to musical fare.  But stage excitement seldom translates undiluted to the screen, and in this RENT is no exception.

The basic story remains the same, and in general concerns the various artistic ambitions and romantic complications of several men and women whose savage rebellion against the status quo has led them to hand-to-mouth lives in New York.  But even as they come together to protest the impending commercialization of the dilapidated district they call home, their relationships with each other begin to spiral out of control--and the lifestyle of casual sex and drug abuse begins to take a serious toll, with several HIV-positive characters forced to face mortality in increasingly direct ways.

With two exceptions, the cast consists of those who originated the roles in the 1996 Broadway show.  To my mind, the big noise here is Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who repeats his Tony award-winning performance as Angel, a street musician and drag queen who acts as the emotional center of the group; that said, however, the overall cast is quite fine and plays at full throttle, even if Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel do seem a bit too old for this story of youthful angst some ten years after they originated their roles on the New York stage.

Unfortunately, the film stumbles in a visual sense.  Certainly there is considerable urban decay on the screen, but it is also very much a Hollywood-ized concept of it; instead of going with a rawly gritty quality, which would have benefited the material, the designers have elected to sweeten everything where possible, and the end result has a slightly ""sanitized for your protection"" quality.  But the real stumble is in the adaptation.

Apparently the powers-that-be felt that the movie-going public was just not bright enough to sort out who is who and who is doing what; consequently many of the ensemble numbers have been somewhat simplified, and the result is somewhat less exciting that the originals.  To add further insult, it also seems very obvious that the powers-that-be drew the line at presenting the show as the opera that it is; on stage, RENT has very little in the way of spoken dialogue, but on screen the adaptors have been careful to separate the major musical numbers with chit-chat that adds nothing to the show and which actually creates yet another and still greater problem.

Although RENT is most particularly remembered for such memorable set pieces as ""One Great Song,"" ""Light the Candle,"" ""Tango Maureen,"" and so on, Larson actually planted the a sense of time and place and considerable character development in the small musical transitions between these numbers--and virtually every one of those transitions have been cut in order to accommodate the notion that there has to be spoken dialogue.  When you add in one or two very questionable cuts of major songs as well... the end result has a tendency to read as more of a series of very memorable music videos instead of a cohesive whole.  It was a bad idea.

Even so, and while RENT the movie will never compare to RENT the play, it still has enough going for it to hold you in a very firm grip, and I recommend it.  The special edition double DVD is also very strong in terms of bonuses, and it may well be a unique example of bonuses that give as much (if not more) information on the original Broadway version and its creators as to the film itself.  Recommended.

2717384,5,B000LXH0AY,"Once you have had the opportunity to watch the 6 fantastic documentaries that accompany the film version of RENT, you'll soon see why this movie was a ""great tribute to a great artist.""  That artist is, or more aptly ""was,"" Jonathan Larson - the writer and composer of this wonderful musical, which is one of the biggest hits in Broadway history.

I've been a big RENT fan for years now, and I was eagerly awaiting the film version's arrival.  When I walked out of the theater after seeing it, I was so hyped about what I had just witnessed on screen.  It was a beautiful portrayal of Jonathan Larson's vision of his life and times in New York City as a struggling, but very talented artist.

Chris Columbus did a very admirable job adapting this musical to the screen, and although some RENT fans have voiced their displeasure in the movie, I must disagree.  Sure, there are some things that have been either left out or altered from the stage version, but this has happened in every movie version of a musical.  Plus, it happens whenever a movie is spawned from a book - as so many are.

People always complain that they aren't seeing every little moment, character, or line of dialogue up there on screen.  Oh well!  In my opinion, I think they are being a little too critical.  They should take the movie for what it is.  As long as it's plenty entertaining, and the things that are left out don't diminish the overall story too much, then the director has done a good enough job.  Chris Columbus respects Jonathan Larson and his work greatly, and if you watch the documentaries, you'll see that Jonathan's parents and sister are very pleased with the film version.  If it's good enough for them, then it's good enough for me.

Overall, I would recommend this to any fan of musicals, and especially those fellow ""RENTHEADS"" out there.  You know who you are!!!  Thank you Chris Columbus, and more importantly, thank you Jonathan Larson.  You brought the world a great musical story and gift when you brought us RENT!",1140739200,,2019,4.592178770949721

2717389,5,B000LXH0AY,"It was the last day of school before Thanksgiving break. I trotted downstairs to check the paper. A movie I was going to see received a negative review. Hours later, I saw that movie. That critic didn't know jack.

That movie was

RENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This adaptation of an equally awesome Broadway musical is far from another nail in the coffin of the movie musical. In fact, it is another nail pried off said coffin.

Fans will approach this film with hesitation since it is directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and Home Alone) and starring six of the original eight leading cast members from the original Broadway cast as well as the girl who went topless in Alexander and some girl who no one has probably ever heard of before.

Be not afraid: Columbus knows what he is doing, the six cast members look like they left the show last week (in that they look as young as ever) and the two newbies fit in as if they were there from the beginning.

All the musical numbers are translated effectively onto the screen. Rather than being completely sung through like onstage, the film contains a good deal of dialogue. Also, a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeery noticeable change is the rearranging of Seasons of Love as the opening number when onstage it opens Act II. What some may consider blasphemy, this customer calls a very good call. Doing the show as it was written would not have worked for film and since Seasons of Love is the most famous song, it's better to start the film off. Like the two new cast members, Seasons of Love feels lik it's been the opening number all along and the dialogue feels like it's been a part of the show forever.

Now to the cast:

Anthony Rapp is back as Mark Cohen, the aspiring filmmaker. Having only heard him on the soundtrack, he's even better on film.

Adam Pascal, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Aida early in its run, is amazing as Roger Davis, the HIV+ musician looking to write ""one great song"" before he leaves this world. Love his hairdo as well.

Idina Menzel, who I had the pleasure of seeing in Wicked shortly after she won her Tony, kicks ass as Maureen Johnson, Mark's lesbian ex-girlfriend. She's sexy, she's funny, she's sassy. You gotta love it.

Taye Diggs, Idina's real life husband, is equally excellent as Benjamin Coffin III aka Benny, the sellout landlord who married some rich bimbo and is trying to evict his friends. Frankly, his talents are underused. He only gets one good song to himself and it's over far too quickly.

Wilson Jermaine Heredia reprises his Tony winning role as Angel, the cross-dressing HIV+ street musician who wins the heart of another man and the audience. He has a voice like an angel, and man does he make an attractive woman.

Jesse L. Martin steals the show as Tom Collins, an HIV+ ex-NYU professor. His voice is like velvet, he brings huge laughs (stealing the movie when he bursts into the apartment declaring a ""Merry Christmas, bitches!""), and his rendition of the reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" is my favorite moment of the show. Hell, he's my favorite character in the piece.

The newbies are Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson.

Tracie Thoms is superior to Fredi Walker, the original Joanne. As the lesbian lawyer who Maureen leaves Mark for, she wins the audience over with her kick-ass voice and humor. Ironically, she has auditioned several times for Rent. Let's hope she makes it to the actual show in the near future.

Rosario Dawson is a wild spitfire as Mimi, the (you guessed it) HIV+ S&M dancer. She could dance circles around Daphne Rubin-Vega, the original Mimi, and is a hell of a lot prettier. She sings and dances like a pro too.

With cameos by Aisha de Haas (another original cast member) as a bag lady and Sarah Silverman as tabloid newshost Alexi Darling, the cast is a joy to watch.

Add to this joyous Bohemian celebration some sorely overlooked cinematography and you have a film that made this reviewer turn to his Dad and say, ""I'm so happy!""

""No day but today."" That is a wonderful way to live life. In the moment, day by day. Jonathon Larson conveys a powerful message in those words. It truly is a tragedy that he was unable to see what an impact his musical would have on the world.

I looove RENT so much, it's a wonderful message, really heartfelt and it hits close to home. A story of friends living the bohemian life in NYC circa 1989-1990 and most everyone in the clan has AIDS. Amazingly, now that I think back (and watch it again), the only real bit of comic relief that I can remember is Mark and Roger's answering machine's repetitive-ness: SPEEEEAAK gets me every time. :) At first when I went to see it, I didn't think I would like the movie very much, it looked too into the rock-music for me to enjoy. But I was (obviously and thankfully) mistaken. The music was wonderful and the parts were played by the seasoned Broadway actors who originated them (except Mimi/Dawson and Joanne/Thoms). Everyone's performances were the most believable that I have ever seen, probably because they've been so comfortable in them for so many years. I surprised myself as I felt tears running down my face at the end; I didn't think it had had that big of an impact on me. Wrong again.

2717397,5,B000LXH0AY,"I'll preface my review by saying that I am only passingly familiar with the play Rent. Before watching the movie, I had been turned onto seeing it after listening to the music from the Broadway show, but I have never seen the play actually performed. As such, I can't really comment on how this film stacks up to the play, only how it stands on its own as a film.

What strikes me about Rent early on is the very good acting by all of the cast. For most of this, I can chalk it up to experience with the characters; most of the original cast of the play makes it into the movie and thus they have 10 plus years of working with their parts. However, even the new additions are very well acted. The characters of Rent live a carefree Bohemian lifestyle, but there is still an incredible sadness within them. Most of the cast has AIDS and is doomed to die in a very painful manner. Those who do not have AIDS live with the knowledge that they will have to watch as their friends die. For most of the film, those emotions go unstated, but they are clearly in the background for every character.

A solid example of this sadness on the inside comes through during the song ""Another Time,"" when Mimi flirts with Roger and he pushes her away because of his fear of opening up to someone as he dies of the virus. In a very angry song, he breaks down for a moment and begins saying softly, ""I should tell you, I should tell you..."" only to explode in anger again. The performance is very subtle, but Roger's pain remains evident in his voice even as he keeps it hidden. The characters are as real as fictional constructs can be; they do not simply feel happy or sad or angry. They carry around a mix of emotions, and the actors portray those mixed emotions as they try to have a good time in what are potentially their final days.

The music of Rent is obviously one of the highlights of the film. Although many songs have been cut out from the play, probably due to the time constraints on a film, the important ones are still there and they still sound terrific. If anything, the cast has improved in their musical talent over the years, and the wide variety of quirky and beautiful songs written by the late Jonathan Larson are all performed to perfection. The music remains important to the plot, advancing the storylines and highlighting all the key moments of the film.

Rent is a movie that covers all of the emotions that a person would realistically have when they are facing something as powerful and deadly as AIDS. The performances are sharp and the music is terrific. This is a film that will move you from happiness to anger to sadness and back again, covering everything in between along the way.",1140652800,,2702,4.387225548902196

And after paying close attention to the transfer of the play to the screen little has change in feelings about this work.

Loosely based on Puccini's 'La Boheme' (with some direct quotes in the score) this musical drama has much to say about AIDS, kids as artists, survival, all forms of gay life, extended family - many subjects that make it worthy of production.  The cast performs extremely well from the opening 'Chorus Line' takeoff  through the intimate and blaring production numbers. The pacing is excellent, the cinematography is good, the mood is right.  So why the three star rating?  For this viewer/listener the score is so thread bare and trite that it is difficult to understand why it has attracted such huge success. There is one song (which opens the show) and otherwise the rest of the score melts into an indistinguishable m&eacute;lange of repetition.  The cast carries it off admirably, but at the end of the work the impact is more in the idea than the execution.  Overrated. Grady Harp, February 06",1140566400,,1218,4.878640776699029

2717401,5,B000LXH0AY,"I'm straight.  I don't have AIDS.  Heck, I'm a Christian.  But I have a heart, I have a soul, and thus, I can't rate this DVD as anything but wonderful.  The beauty of Rent, to me, is that it does an amazing job of showing that people who live ""alternate"" lifestyles are not some monsters, as many in the world would have us believe.  Instead, they are PEOPLE.  They have the same hopes, dreams, loves, and pains that everyone else has.  The hatred around homosexuals, trans-gendered people, and other ""alternative"" living people is such a joke, such a horrible thing, and this movie helps to show why that is.

When I see a work such as this, it helps to remind me that not everyone is as narrow-minded as Rev. Phelps and his crew.  Movies like this give me hope that one day, we will all live together in love.",1140566400,,812,4.36

Rent ""RENT"" or buy ""RENT"", as it will not be money wasted. It tells the story of friendship and love in the worst of times and measures that love within a year. It does not matter if you are so ""politically correct"" to dislike gay`s and lesbian`s , just watch it for the music and close your eyes. This is a movie that ""hits where the heart is"" and if you have a heart you will be moved by this movie. I only wish my late mom was with me to watch it , this would have been her kind of movie , even at 85 , had she lived. I`m as straight as they make`m , but I have a heart too.

2717403,5,B000LXH0AY,"Long time has passed since I first heard this amazing music from a Broadway show that dared to be different. Ten years, in fact. In that time, our world has become a much different place; harsher, more scary, less tolerant in many ways. And all of that just makes Rent more relevant and more real, and speaks to us just as strongly as ever.

Rent is the story of a group of artisians and visionaries, stuck in dire circumstances, struggling to make their mark in the world before the world makes its mark on them. Mark, a filmmaker, lives with Roger, a musician, in a rundown building in New York's Lower East Side. Mimi, a girl who lives below the pair falls madly in love with Roger. Collins, a friend and former roommate, meets Angel, a drummer drag queen, after getting bashed. Lawyer Joanne's on again, off again relationship with her sensuous partner Maureen, a performance artist, flows with the story.

Together, these people make Rent. Each person strivse to fulfill their life's desires, but like the visionary opening scene, their dreams quickly turn to ash as they pitch them out the windows in fiery blazes as reality sets in. The story dares to suggest we must strive daily towards our goals, for we may not have a tomorrow to depend on.

But Rent is so much more than story, it's the music. Songs brought over from the stage show are intact and beautiful. The powerhouse ""Rent"" opening number is equally as thrilling on celluloid. Angel and Collins' romp in ""I'll Cover You"" is powerfully joyful; as powerfully sad as its reprise at the funeral in the second half of the movie. La Vie Boheme is amazing; energetic, fun, and it makes you want to get up and dance. Songs missing from the musical do not leave gaps at all in the movie (well, perhaps one... ""Goodbye Love).

The performances in the movie are rich. Portrayed by many of the originial cast members, who bring with them memories of Rent's early days, they each have a depth to their characters that communicates worlds just in a glance or a smile. Anthony Rapp's Mark look when he first meets Joanne is classic. Adam Pascal's ""Light My Candle"" is rich, sexy, and daring. Idina brings such humor and energy to her ""Over the Moon"" segment. Wilson Jermaine Heredia shines in Angel's ""Today for You"", and Jesse L. Martin steals the movie in his powerful ""I'll Cover You"" refrain. Newcomers Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Rosario Dawson each hold their own in the new group.

The DVD brings two discs; the first, the movie with director's commentary. The second brings a powerful documentary on the life of Jonathan Larson. This documentary traces out the development of Larson's career, tragically cut short from his death just as Rent was going to take off. A very moving part of the documentary is a tribute to Larson's friends, Gordon, Allie, and Pam, who are mentioned in Rent.

In retrospect, this just isn't a film, this is history. Chris Columbus has now captured on film orginial perfomances of an amazing musical. In a hundred years, when they are studying the devleopment of musical theater, they'll have this film to look back on to remember these moments. Jonathan Larson's gift to the world was the musical Rent. We now have this film to celebrate it; and celebrate, we shall.",1140480000,,3256,4.693520140105079
2717404,4,B000LXH0AY,"This is a decent adaption of the Broadway play. Jesse L. Martin is the only reason I feel the need to own this DVD. He is remarkable!

I take offense to the person who suggested that teens don't need to see homosexuals and trangendered people. That's crazy talk. Did you ever consider that perhaps there are many teens who ARE homosexual and/or transgendered? They deserve to see themselves reflected. Personally, I don't get why a PG:13 means there will be nothing but straight white people copulating. That sounds kind of ignorant to me. Sorry but I think you are a little homophobic. Nobody's youth is going to get away from them just because they are exposed to gay people.",1140480000,,677,4.689075630252101
2717405,5,B000LXH0AY,"I could sing the praises of RENT forever. It has been my favorite show for years, and it has gotten to the point that whenever I say I'm going to New York, my friends roll their eyes and ask how many times I'll see RENT -this- time.

This is the movie version. I say that because people need to remember that this is not a DVD of a stage production. While I admit to lamenting the fact that some of my favorite songs (""Christmas Bells,"" especially) are nowhere in this script, it does in fact work. It still celebrates the spirit and the joy that Jon Larson's work has inspired in all of us RENTheads for a decade now.

There are parts that seem bizarre and are not from the stage version (Maureen [Menzel] and Joanne's [Thoms] engagement party), and there are things that are amazing that also aren't in the stage version (spoken dialogue, bantering and witty, is much more prevalent). The songs are performed beautifully; the fact that six of the eight principle actors are from the original Broadway cast certainly helps immediately bring the feeling of the original show, and Tracie Thoms especially is a radiant addition to them. Adam Pascal (Roger) has said that the recording of the songs this time around is what it should have been originally, and they are indeed often more hard, more pressing, with the urgency that is such a key undertone to the show.

There are some problems. Some of the shots are ridiculous, such as when we find ourselves looking up at Angel [Heredia] dancing on the table in ""Today 4 U"" in a completely unflattering, bizarre shot, not to mention the under-arm shots of Maureen and Joanne during ""Take Me Or Leave Me."" Benny's [Diggs] and Mark's [Rapp] characters are both reduced, as key elements of each of their characters are taken away. Luckily, the deleted scenes are included on a bonus disc, and these establish and fill out the aspects of their characters that are missing.

Though there are a few problems, the fact of the matter remains that RENT will always be superb. A little trimming of some songs and a few personality traits are not going to dampen the spirit of such a great piece of theatre -- and now cinema -- history. ""La Vie Boheme"" is amazing, and all of the actors -- ALL of the actors -- put their all into this movie. The overwhelming sense of love and respect comes through their acting and makes it a true pleasure to watch.

The special features on the DVD are great too -- the documentary on Jonathan Larson is fantastic and tragic (as his story should be), and the deleted scenes are well worth watching for any RENThead. I especially enjoyed the alternate ending, which immediately took me back to the stage version and had me crying after just that one scene.

The stage version, of course, is still better. RENT was written for the stage, and it does its job beautifully there. But Chris Columbus has done a great job of keeping the spirit, and this is a great DVD to have to tide you over for all of those months when you find yourself in Ohio and nowhere near Broadway.

Ahh, RENT. The show that has always made us appreciate life and love has once again, through this movie, reinforced its central theme: No day but today.",1140480000,,3193,4.542608695652174

2717408,5,B000LXH0AY,"For the most part, a lot of musicals on broadway that turn into full length films are no where near as good as the show on stage. In The case of RENT, I will make an exception because it is a good percentage of the original cast, the filming was done rather well, and the music was recorded again in the studio and sounds phenomenal! I love this DVD because not only is this my favorite musical, but because they did such an awesome job making the transfer from stage to film. And I was absolutely thrilled after I saw it. It was so good in theatres that I saw it 4 times. Now that I have the DVD (I got it early from a friend of a friend) I have a reason to sit at home and be lazy! I can watch RENT on DVD now!!!

I went to see the movie with my daughter (she's 20) (she never saw it on Broadway) and we loved every minute of the movie. It was fun to watch her reaction not knowing really the storyline for rent.  She and I half way through the movie looked at each other and said  ""have to buy it when it comes out on DVD.""  The music is unbelievable, the actors performances and talents, the moving storyline, etc.. I'm sure the movie has it's flaws but I didn't see them.  I found a better perception of each scene from the movie as opposed to the play. I found the play harder to follow, still wonderful but I really enjoyed the movie.

There are some excellent parts (Santa Fe) and some terrible ones (What You Own Britney-style music video) but all in all it is mediochre. If you can't see the show on stage, see the movie. But do not judge the show by it. The experience is so different. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anybody unless they know that they will never get to see it on stage. It just feels flat and forced.

Note how Roger and Mark throw their papers into the trash can to heat up their apartment. Then they grab hold of the aluminum can with their bare hands and toss the fire out the window. That is just something useless and distracting. The movie almost gets it right.",1140393600,,977,4.4581005586592175
2717419,5,B000LXH0AY,"Rent will forever be a legend of musical theatre. Jonathan Larson's intimate and incredibly personal musical went on to win rave reviews, phenominal success, several Tony Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Larson never got to see the success of his baby, however, as he died of an undiagnosed aeortic aneurism the night of the final dress rehearsal. Would Rent have earned the success it did had the tragedy of Larson's death not thrust the musical into the headlines? Would Larson have approved of the move from a small Off-Broadway theatre to a full-blown Broadway production? What would Larson have done had he been granted a lengthy career? We can never know, but he has left a legacy that even the most wide-eyed dreamer couldn't imagine.

This film has been sputtering around Hollywood for nearly a decade, with directors from Spike Lee to Joel Schumacher attached to direct at various times. Thankfully, Mirimax couldn't agree on how to approach the project, which catapulted no less than four directors from behind the camera, leaving room for the vastly underappreciated Chris Columbus to make his first truly great film. His vision for Rent was one that embraces the show's theatrical roots as opposed to masking them, as in 2002's Chicago. He utilizes no tricks to bring the musical numbers inside the characters' heads, and yet his film manages to be the best movie musical in decades, and yes, that is including the aforementioned razzle dazzle Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle.

The story itself is rather insignificant. It follows the basic outline of Puccini's classic opera, La Boheme, updated to include drug abuse, AIDS, homosexuality, drag queens, and most importantly rock music. We follow the lives of a group of eight bohemians living in New York City as they celebrate love and life over the course of a year. They encounter new friends, old enemies, and yes, even death, and yet the film never preaches is message of ""No day but today.""

One of this film's greatest strengths is its cast. With six of the original eight principle actors from the Broadway production, there is a sense of family that is integral to the believability of the drug- and disease-filled story. Of those six, Anthony Rapp as film-maker Mark and Jesse L. Martin as teacher Collins fare the best. Rapp instills Mark with an over-the-top energy that embues his character with a genuinely likable quality, while Martin is so charmingly joyful one can't help but adore the character.

Both newbies give extraordinarily strong performances, particularly Rosario Dawson as the drug-addicted, AIDS-inflicted stripper Mimi. For a character that is often played frustratingly large, Dawson brings to Mimi a sweet vulnerability that serves both story and character. It is unfortunate that the actor who shares the most scenes with Dawson, Adam Pascal, appears so uncomfortable with the medium that Roger, ""the bittersweet, evocative"" songwriter, is both wooden and unrelatable. It's a shame, really, as the Mimi/Roger relationship is at the center of the story. Tracie Thoms, the other newcomer, is easily the best singer in the cast.

The true heart of the film, however, lies in the character of Angel, a lovable drag queen who is also inflicted with AIDS. As played by Wilson Jermaine Heredia, the character is immediately likably familiar. While Heredia plays the character just a tad too flamboyant and stereotypical, that is what Larson wrote for the character. Angel is the reason this story works. He is at once recognizable as a real person, and while he is not actually based on any one person, audiences can see a bit of him in everyone.

The cinematography is absolutely stunning. It compliments both the somber and lively musical numbers without making the film feel glossy. ""Tango: Maureen"" in particular is a fantastic scene, ironically enough being the only scene to take place in a fantasy. The dance itself is electric and powerful, and a perfect introduction to the flighty character Maureen, played by Tony-winner Idina Menzel. Also rousing is ""La Vie Boheme,"" the most celebratory song in the film. There is more energy present in this one scene than appeared in the entire runtime of last year's Phantom of the Opera.

As for the Extras, the DVD is both sparse and rewarding all at once. The commentary with Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal, the sole feature on the first disk, offers little insight into the making of the film, but is interesting enough to warrent a listen. Weirdly enough, though, the language on the commentary is censored with bleeps, something I have never seen before. Disk two is fairly sparse as well, but it contains a 2 hour-long documentary that follows Rent from Jonathan Larson's childhhod straight through to the film. This is one of the best making-of documentaries ever offered as a DVD extra, and it was clearly made with love and respect for the man that brought Rent into being. I found myself weeping when Larson's death was finally mentioned, over an hour into the doc. One would have to have a heart made out of stone not to be moved by Larson's story. Also noteworthy on the second disk are several deleted scenes and musical numbers. The dialgue sequences were clearly deleted for a reason, as they neither advance nor improve the story, but the two songs, ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye, Love"" add much depth and emotion to the final act of the film. These songs are a wonderful addition to the DVD, but Columbus was right in cutting them, much to the disappointment of ""RentHeads"" everywhere.",1140307200,,5538,4.980540540540541

So watching diseased, drug-ravaged squatters so proudly sing their anthems at annoyed working folks is hardly the life-changing affirmation I read in the rave reviews.  They should've called this movie RANT.",1140220800,,617,4.710280373831775

2717423,5,B000LXH0AY,"I have seen both the movie and the stage version of Rent.  I love both of them.  But, we're here to talk about the movie.  I love the fact that most of the original cast is back for this.  Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp are perfect as Roger and Mark. Adam shows the tortured soul that is Roger.  Finding out he has HIV and dealing with his girlfriend's death puts him in a place he never thought he would be.  Mark, Collins, Angel, and Mimi help him realize that he isn't dead yet. Adam takes you through that journey with all the emotions that entails.  Anthony shows Mark's emotions throughout the piece. The look on his face when he sees that Roger has come out of the house, and come to the Life Support meeting shows you just how much he cares for his best friend, and how worried he was, and still is for him.  Having them in two sepereate locations for ""What You Own"" also helps the characters and gives the actors a new way of playing the scene.  When they come together on the roof and you see the emotion as they say ""I'm not alone,"" that is when they both come to the realization that they aren't alone and they don't have to be.  And I have both the OBC and Movie soundtracks, and I've got to say their preformances on the movie soundtrack have improved.  How can you not love Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel?  He is Angel.  Jesse L. Martin blew me away as Collins.  And if you have seen him in Law and Order, you will love him in this.  Wilson and Jesse together are a terrific pair and to see them portray Angel and Collin's relationship is magic.  I do think Taye Diggs was a little underused, but with having to condense the play to a movie time frame, Benny was the one who would have to suffer.  Idina Menzel rules as Maureen, but neither she nor the actress who I just saw play the part will make me like Over the Moon.  That is not my favorite moment in either the movie or the play.  Now, to the new additions.  In my humble opinion, Rosario Dawson blew Daphne Rubin-Vega out of the water.  I thought Daphne sounded whiny as Mimi, Rosario brought life, depth, and fun to her.  Tracie Thoms as Joanne was a wonderful addition.  I did miss Fredi Walker's voice, but Tracie held her own and made the part hers.  Another reviewer seems to think that Adam Pascal and Idina Menzel are suffering from detoriating voices.  That is not the case.  Adam's preformance, as I said before, exceeded the OBC version.  If you don't like hearing his voice in Rent, then I recommend a change of pace, there is the OBC of Aida and his two solo albums, Model Prisoner and Civilian, that will give you a different prespective. Idina hasn't suffered from her preformance in Wicked, she has improved. I look forward to watching the DVD and the deleted scenes, which from what I understand will include the rest of ""Goodbye Love"" and ""Halloween.""  Unfortunatly, ""Contact"" wouldn't have worked in the movie.  Seeing Collins holding Angel in his arms at the hospital brought you to the same place emotionally as the end of Contact.  I hope that the people who didn't see this in the theater will give it a chance on DVD.  The story line is still relevant.  There are still people living with, and dying from, AIDS.  Jonathan Larson's vision still rings true.  ""There's only us, there's only this.  Forget regret, or life is yours to miss.  No other road, no other way.  No day but today.""",1140048000,,3382,4.388083735909823
2717424,4,B000LXH0AY,"I absolutely adored this movie, which I saw on opening night. I have always wanted to see the musical on Broadway, and still plan to as soon as possible. Therefore, I have nothing (i.e. the stage version) to compare the movie to, so I can say that, as a stand-alone movie, it was great.  I thought that the acting was heartfelt, and I loved Rosario Dawson's voice, which I found surprisingly good and unique, as well as the level of vulnerability that she brought to the character of Mimi. When Roger tells her (in ""Light My Candle""), ""You look like you're sixteen,"" you find yourself agreeing with him. It breaks your heart that she looks--and is--so young and is living on her own in the city, addicted to heroin and infected with HIV. I agree with another reviewer--she seems as though she's trying to convince everyone that she's ""born to be bad"" (""Light My Candle""), but I'm just not buying it--not because of a problem with Dawson's acting, but because my take on the character is simply that she's a lost kid trying to figure out who she is.

I thought all of the characters were endearing in their own special way, with the exception of Benny, who, another reviewer rightly pointed out, doesn't show up all that much. The songs were astounding, and I loved the way Larson made an effort to show love in all its varying forms (Angel and Collins, Mimi and Roger, Joanne and Maureen) without seeming too self-conscious of doing it.

The only reason that I knocked the rating down to four stars is that there seem to be a lot of unresolved issues, perhaps that weren't left that way in the musical. My main beef is that the relationship (is that's what, in fact, it's supposed to be) between Mimi and Benny is a little fuzzy, and how it turns out is not explained. Since I have purchased the soundtrack and listened to ""Goodbye, Love,"" I feel I have a little more insight, but it doesn't seem like it is given the attention it needs. By throwing in a few lines or maybe one short scene, I think it would be a little more clear. I also had to dock it by one star because, in my opinion, the ending should have been done better. I'll try not to give anything away, but the big ""She is...NO, she's not! Let's all rejoice and sing!!!"" was a little disappointing. But the music is so fabulous and I became so invested in the characters that I will forgive those two flaws.

I don't agree with the opinion that the movie came too late. As a matter of fact, at a time when new HIV infections among teenagers are on the rise, it seems like it's appearing at just the right time. And, of course, it premiered on Broadway, I believe, in 1996, so we can't forget that, either. Look how long it took Phantom to turn into a movie (which, I must say, I loved as well). It is timely and should be required viewing for teenagers. By putting faces and lives on the disease, it reaches you in a way that some people have (fortunately for them) never experienced, and I left the theater very moved.",1140048000,,2983,4.4083484573502725
2717425,2,B000LXH0AY,"Okay, people who didn't like it: stop saying that it's just for RENT fans.  While I'm sure a lot of RENT fans liked it, a lot of them didn't.  And it's certainly not for every musical fan, either.  We might even hate it more than you do because we know about the stage version, which is superior to the movie.

Anyway, like most hardcore musical fans, I was a RENThead for about a year.  Also like most hardcore musical fans, the phase wore off rather quickly and when I saw the stage production not much later I was bitterly disappointed.  I don't think that RENT is a bad show (in fact, I am listening to the OBC's ""Without You"" as I write this,) I just think that it is horribly overrated.  It's always annoyed me that it's about, as I like to put it, people with no jobs who complain about having no money.  The blatant hypocrisy also has really bothered me: the movie doesn't have ""Contact,"" but in that song they make fun of safe sex.  I'm sorry, but with that kind of attitude it's not really surprising that you got HIV.  I also hate most of the characters, whom I find to be shallow and quite selfish.

Anyway, onto the movie itself.  For the record, I hate Chris Columbus.  I have not seen one movie of his that I like.  People say that he is too faithful to the source, but that is entirely not true.  He adds what some would consider minor changes, but these changes are enough to completely warp something into something else, something that it entirely shouldn't be.

First off, setting it in 1989.  WHAT was he thinking?  RENT does not belong in that year.  It belongs in the 90's.  There were so many anachronisms and inconsistancies that it was ridiculous.  Thelma and Louise is the one that critics have pointed out the most.  Now, if Chris Columbus had a good reason for setting it in 1989 I might be a bit kinder, but I believe he set it there because that's when he lived in NYC.  Uh... yeah.

Second off, all or nothing.  RENT is considered a rock opera.  That means minimal dialogue.  That means including the recitative-like ""Tune-Ups"" and ""Voicemails"" which were dispersed throughout the score to unify everything.  Without those interconnecting ""dialogue"" songs, the score became a jumbled-together mess: songs started, randomly and abruptly.  That also means leaving in ""Christmas Bells"" and ""Goodbye, Love.""  Taking out ""Goodbye, Love"" removed the important development of Roger's reason for leaving, which was because Mimi was ill.  It also took out Mark's development, when Roger says that all he does is hide behind his camera.  The ommission of ""Halloween"" did that, as well.  I won't even begin to talk about how they depleted Benny's character.

Third off, the ""staging"" for some of the songs.  ""Another Day"" should not be sung from Mimi and co. on the ground to Roger on the balcony.  I kept thinking ""If she's bugging you so much, go back inside!""  It loses its impact if it's so distant.  I was really mad about that, because I love that song.  The scenes with Roger in Santa Fe were so darn cheesy I cannot even begin to explain what was wrong with them, and setting ""What You Own"" right after he comes back is quite stupid to me.  My favorite part of the song has always been when Roger sings ""The filmmaker cannot see"" and we're like ""OMG!  He's back!""  Chris Columbus TOTALLY ruined that effect.  And setting ""Out Tonight"" at a strip club?  What the heck?  I'm so thoroughly perturbed by that I won't even begin to nitpick about how Mimi is an S&M dancer, not a Go Go Dancer.

Fourth, what was with the rent notices being burned and thrown into the street?  Maybe it looked cool, but all I could think was ""Fire hazard!""

Fifth, and my BIGGEST issue which gets its own section... the gay wedding!  What the heck!  Not only was it completely random and there for no purpose other than political soapboxing, it was OOC.  Maureen isn't a commitment kind of gal.  Joanne's parents, who hate Maureen in the original musical, would NEVER approve.  The scene itself was really just uncomfortable.  If they wanted a gay couple to marry, why not Collins and Angel?  At least they were a good couple.  Ugh ugh ugh.

Now, onto performances themselves.  I'm sorry, but the OBC was too old.  They were tired.  They had played the roles a gazillion time and had nothing new to say.  If you compare them to the OBC recording, there's a multitude of difference.  I'll review each individually, though:

Mark - Anthony Rapp did all right, but nothing special.

Roger - Adam Pascal just can't sing anymore; he's been beating his voice up too much.  It has deteriorated and it shows.  He lacked passion.  Roger's a hard character to play without making him whiney, and while Adam succeeded in doing this on the OBC he didn't so much in the movie.

Mimi - Boring.  Rosario's acting itself was good, but RENT is a musical.  That means acting alone won't suffice: you need to act when you sing.  Also, she didn't have the vocal chops for it.  Her voice was pretty enough, but Mimi isn't a pretty little ingenue.  Also, this isn't her fault, but she was too sweet and pretty to be Mimi; Mimi needs to seem more... rough and used.  And she straight-toned the entire time.  Drove me nuts.  She lacked the sheer passion and edge of Daphen Ruben-Vega, who sang the heck out of those songs.

Maureen - I am no fan of Idina Menzel, I will admit that right out.  Like Adam Pascal, her voice has deteriorated.  I blame her smoking and bellowing at the top of her lungs in Wicked.  Anyway, personality-wise she was fine, though I hate Maureen.

Collins - Very good; he made me cry during ""I'll Cover You (reprise)""  And his voice is wonderful.

Angel - Awesome as well, but I've always loved Wilson in that role.

Benny - Poor guy didn't get much of a part, but what we saw of him was good.

Joanne - Tracy Thoms was FANTASTIC!  I like her even better than OBC Joanne!  This is the first time I'd ever seen Joanne ""win"" in ""Take Me Or Leave Me.""  Also the first time I've ever really liked her.

In this movie's defense, it was better than the Phantom of the Opera (not that it's hard.)  And, though they performed better back in the day, the vocal performances were (with the exception of Rosario Dawson) at least passable.  That's hard to find in musical-movies nowadays.

But I agree with other people who said that this movie came far too late.  HIV isn't as much of a problem anymore, after all.  Without really great characters (which RENT has never, ever had IMO) it's hard to give us a reason to care about people who, as I said earlier, have no job and complain about having no money.",1139875200,,6602,4.50211327134404
2717426,4,B000LXH0AY,"Like many Rent fans, I was both elated and worried when I heard they were turning my beloved musical into a movie.  I was further worried when they handed it over to Chris Columbus, a director who's edgiest material (that I'm aware of) is Harry Potter.

Overall, I feel Columbus stayed true to Larson's masterpiece.  The acting is amazing. With the exception of Rosario Dawson and Tracy Thoms, these actors MADE their roles. Anthony Rapp and Jesse L. Martin were beyond unbelievable, and stole every scene they were in.  Adam Pascal plays the most heartfelt Roger I've ever seen, even if he can't act in anything else. As for the newbies, Tracy Thoms did an amazing Joanne, but I'm a bit unhappy with Rosario Dawson's performance. She turned a heroin-addicted HIV positive stripper in a bondage club to the girl next door (or down the stairs).  Her dancing was excellent, but her singing only passable. Frankly, I didn't believe her ""Out Tonight.""

I disagree with Columbus' cuts, but I understand his reasoning.  What I thought strange was the few changes Columbus conspicuously did to single words; more often than not, they wound up changing some aspect of the character who said them, and differed from Larson's vision.  An example of this is the gender of the engineer Joanne hires.

Despite the few disappointments, this movie is a breathtaking tribute to a great man, and successfully brings the musical to the big screen.",1139702400,,1429,4.871900826446281
2717427,3,B000LXH0AY,"I bought the 2 cd soundtrack for Rent back in the '90s and wore out the disks.  I listened to it constantly, and still do.  I followed the journey of Rent from stage to screen with a mixed bag of emotions.  They got most of the original cast (GREAT!) Shooting on location in New York (Great!)  Chris Columbus, the same guy who directed Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone is directing this movie (Uh-Oh.)  But still there was some hope.  He did a decent enough job with the first two Harry Potter movies because he made it an extremely faithful adaptation.  Maybe he'd do the same here.  Then a PG-13 rating.  The soundtrack included some rather strong language and some songs with risque content which in this ultra conservative day, would have guaranteed it an ""R.""

Still I was cautiously optimistic that the movie would follow in the footsteps of other cinematic rock operas like ""Tommy"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""

No such luck.

For some reason they decided to set the first part of the movie in 1989, even though they refence several elements from the 90's, like ""Thelma & Louise"" for example.

Then much of the songs has been switched to straight dialogue interrupted at times by a musical number.  Often this dialogue would bring the movie to a screeching halt, only to come alive again when the singing started.

I have no complaints about any of the actors.  I thought they were all great, even if some were different from the original.

My problem is that I wanted more singing.  I wanted Chris Columbus to be as faithful to the stage production of Rent as he was to the books of Harry Potter.  I would have been satisfied if he had just pointed a camera at the stage and let it run during a performance, just to keep all of the songs intact.

Instead we have a movie that feels like it plays down the fact that it's a musical, that altered the subject matter to get a more family friendly rating, that, let's face it, sold out to the corporate interests that it pretended to criticize.",1139702400,,1995,4.5195530726256985

Ok, on to the movie. I loved it, as i already said. It was both fun, and sad at time. i don't want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it(what are you waiting for!) I was very suprised to hear it got mixed reviews. But then, alot of movies lately are gettign mixed reviews, no matter how good they are.

I also want to respond to the review that said the PG-13 rating was inappropriate. The play is not intended for children, also I don't think any children who saw the trailer said ""Mommy, Daddy, I want to see RENT!!!"" Plus, kids don't pay attention to ratings anymore. If the kid wants to see it, their going to rent the R rated movie behind his or her parent's back. If the kid is going to see a truly fantastic film that addresses adult issues, he or she might as well see this.",1139356800,,743,4.345323741007194

2717431,4,B000LXH0AY,"I fell in love with RENT the stage musical when I saw it during my college years in Chicago (1995-1999).  I've seen it 4 times on stage and loved each performance.  I wasn't fortunate enough to see the Orignal Broadway Cast on stage, but I know their musical soundtrack backwards and forwards.  I often find myself sing a song out of the blue to make the time fly by, especially at work.  When I heard that they finally made a movie version of my fave musical, I knew I'd be there to see it opening weekend.

What RENT the movie has going for it is that most of the original Broadway cast has been reassembled.  The voices that I love from the Broadway soundtrack are here in this film.  The film itself was well done.  The look and feel of the East Village was captured beautifully.  The film took some liberties with the time frame of the first half of the story but it was necessary for the film's pacing.  Everyone gave good performances in the film.  The power of the story really comes alive and grabs you on film much more so than it does on stage.  There is just so much more you can do on film than on stage.  However, not everything on stage translates well to film.  Luckily, RENT is one property that has translated well IMO.

The major downside for me was that Daphne Rubin Vega did not play Mimi.  Rosario Dawson does a nice job acting wise, but her voice is nowhere near as powerful or passionate as Daphne's.  Songs like Out Tonight and Without You suffer IMO from Rosario's ""soft"" voice.  Also, one of my favorite numbers, ""Christmas Bells"", was not included in the film.  However, with the needed story pacing change of the first act,  cutting the number was understandable.  Other than that, I loved the movie.  I'm so excited to get this on DVD.",1139356800,,1765,4.3993808049535605

2717433,5,B000LXH0AY,"I was disturbed, as mentioned in other reviews, by the PG13 rating of this movie becuase of the blatant(and sometimes gratouious feeling)exhibitions of homosexuality, and lesbianism. Also the ""CatScratch Club"" number is not child friendly. That said.

I never saw the Broadway production but would believe the original actors are in the movie. The way they portray their characters is very stagelike, but it adds to the feel of the movie overall. The original actors may appear to be older than what their characters should be, but I think this too was better than using younger actors that have less life experience and could not play the same roles with as much depth. Rosario Dawson was a standout as Mimi, but the rest of the cast was also amazing!

The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, reminding us all that we only have 525,600 minutes a year to live life at the fullest, and I think the message to be gained from this movie is that is doesn't matter how you live, just as long as you live doing what you love surrounded by people you love.

The movie overall is very worthwhile to see, and after I've seen it, I clearly understand why it did so well on Broadway. The movie IS NOT as depressing as it may appear originally and is worth seeing - maybe after the kids are asleep.",1139270400,,1286,4.582608695652174

2717445,5,B000LXH0AY,"Rent. Adapted from the 1996 hit broadway musical by Johnathan Larson is an amazing film. No, amazing is an understatement. Think along the lines of phenomenal, yet it is even more than than that. I haven't seen a really good film I can say I would stop people on the streets to see, but Rent renewed that for me, and even now my 525,600 minutes of the year have become enjoyable to the least, and this film has started off in a great way.

Brought on by it's information I found in magazines and talk shows, I thought maybe Rent would be something of originality. I have not been enjoying the recent slew of remakes, but am more than happy to see a film that is of difference than others. Not to mention, I haven't seen a musical on stage or film since the Little Shop of Horrors came to Arizona in 1999. I think good music is what every film needs. Rent had just a little bit more which made it even better than the rest.

In New York City, the life of several friends is being threatened and they can tell you that in their own way. Mark Cohen and Roger Davis (Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal) are threatened to leave their apartment building when former friend Benjamin (Taye Diggs) plans to build a so-called cyberspace club inside the building. But that's when fate meets love and Mimi (Rosario Dawson) a fellow attendant to the building, falls in love with Roger.

Past loves such as Mark's ex-girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) who's fallen in love with proper but committed Lawyer, Joann Jefferson (Trace Thoms) come to each other once again as friends. Angel finds Tom and life is becoming more difficult as the reality of everything sinks in for the seven friends. But there is nothing to do but love each other and live on with past dreams. Death may come and find them, but love will hold strong no matter who you are. And even then you won't have to pay the rent.

I couldn't help but feel all throughout the movie that reality was more than captured in Rent, and it may sound far fetched because it is. Musicals are usually silly and make you laugh. Rent does make you laugh, there's no question about it. But you know you've watched a really good film when it stays with you long afterwards. In this case, I knew I had because even 24 hours after, I am going to see it again tomorrow. There's more than enough that's lifted off your mind as you relate the characters. Being a filmmaker myself, I could relate to Mark who took his beloved camera everywhere he went.

As for music, such songs as ""Seasons of Love"" and ""What you own"" will touch you in the heart and in the mind realizing these characters are really you. ""Rent"" and ""Santa Fe"" will bring out the dreams and hardships you once faced (and probably still face) in your life. On the other hand, ""La Vie Boheme"" will make you laugh and laugh and laugh...and then some. The whole soundtrack has been stuck in my head since yesterday yet I enjoy remembering them (just not when I try to sleep!).

Rent will hit you where you feel. There's more to Rent than anyone can explain. It's magic touches you, and for me, I'm a touchy feely kind of person, but have never been obessed with a film like this. It's one that stays with you long after, and is a film you can enjoy after a good long week. My week at school was not exactly the best, and that was all lifted off my shoulders when music was thrown in in less than 3 hours. Anyone can use Rent at anytime. There's No Day But Today.",1139011200,,3448,4.354587869362364
2717446,5,B000LXH0AY,"This is one of my new favorite movies!!  Great cast, great tunes, great everything!!! Everyone see it ,rent it, buy it!",1138838400,,119,4.666666666666667
2717447,3,B000LXH0AY,"Before I say anything, I should confess that I had never seen RENT on stage, and had only listened to snippets of a few songs. However, it was these snippets that convinced me that I had to see this movie; unfortunately, it was not playing in my hometown, but I was able to see it in the town over (about 45 minutes away) in a really good theatre. Now that's out of the way, what did I think?

Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come QUITE across the way that it was probably intended. Yes, the chilling doom of AIDS is effectively given (Probably the scariest image in the entire film is Mimi lying in a gutter, shivering because of her constant drug feed); however, the fact that Chris Columbus directed the film probably wasn't a hopeful omen to begin with; Chris Columbus will always film an adaptation as completely faithful to its source, and that's not always a good thing.

Really, the problems are a bit obvious, even when you're watching the film for the first time. While the actors give amazing performances (the newcomers [Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne] especially), they are now ten years older than when they originated the parts (except, of course, for the newcomers), and they just don't look the age that they're supposed to anymore. Now one could probably pass this off as saying that this is the effect that both drugs and living in New York in those years would have on anyone, but that just seems a bit packed to me (especially considering how hot Mimi is when, apparently, she's the most drugged character in the entire movie).

Other big problems come with Columbus trying to make this film as faithful to the stage show as possible. By keeping so many of the events the way they are, and keeping almost every song (although, to his credit, he did cut a LOT of the filler music that made the show almost completely sung through), he essentially turns the film into nothing more than an excuse to sing song after song, with little cohesive narrative to push through. For instance, the whole funeral scene with (spoiler) probably could have been cut, with the film cutting straight to the graveyard. They didn't need to sing there.  In short, The film seems more like a stream of music videos than a film.

Thankfully, however, there is one thing (apart from the actors) that saves this movie, and that is the MUSIC. I myself was not impressed with most of the numbers when I saw the film, but I have since bought the 2-Disk CD, and have fallen in love with every single number. Jonathan Larson really wrote these numbers well, giving them the contemporary edge needed to win over those who might be wary of seeing a movie where people just SING their feelings. Also, this music has some of my favorite lyrics of all time, above anything I've ever heard before, like:

Ever since puberty/

Everybody stares at me/

Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby/

Please take me/

Out Tonight/

Don't forsake me/

Out Tonight/

I'll let you make me

Out Tonight!/

In short, the music in this musical probably ranks up to my second favorite musical score, beat only by the score of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera.

In the end, as the title suggests, you need to take this film for what it is: an incredibly faithful adaptation of a hit Broadway show that loses its way a few times. No more, no less.",1138665600,,3344,4.557595993322204

Even though most of the lyrics were the same, there were more drums, more guitars and the music seemed so powerful I was afraid it would take away from the plot and theme of the movie. I refused to listen to the movie soundtrack for a while.

But when I saw the movie, the soundtrack made sense. The more modern music fit in perfectly with the vivid colors and strong emotions that could be seen in the movie.

Many of the songs were cut out for the film version, but considering the musical is almost four hours, I think it was perfectly understandable for them to cut out the songs that they did.  I found the most appealling aspect of the transformation to be the sets.  I knew that, with this being a film version, they would have the ability to move from scene to scene.  Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that the musical takes place on stage with few set changes.  But being able to see different rooms in different buildings and various areas of the city really made the movie enjoyable.  Also, having all but two of the original cast memebers made the film that much more impressive.  Some of the lyrics were changed, but not to a degree that made the music any less enjoyable.  It was also impressive to see some of the lyrics transformed into dialogue for this version.

I think whether you've seen the musical on stage or not, this is still a film worth seeing.  The music is incredible, the acting is awesome, and the cinematography itself is phenomenal.  Definitely check it out.",1137801600,,1236,4.444444444444445
2717454,5,B000LXH0AY,"There's a lot of good and bad in the film adaptation of Rent.

First off, this is one of those musicals that is better on stage.  Yes, a lot of reviewers have said this, and a lot of others have said to go see the show onstage if that is what you were looking for.  But, for example, Chicago outshined it's onstage counterpart, and it is possible for a film adaptation to be better then the theatrical versions.  Rent is not.

Next, the acting is a huge problem for Rent.  The cast is too old.  It's simple.  And to anyone who claims these original cast members are the 'best' at their parts in the world, I encourage you to look again.  Rosario Dawson, as Mimi, does better then Rubin-Vega as the original Mimi.  If someone could be found that was better, as Dawson was, this could have been done for all the cast.

Also, another big problem is these actors are trained for theatre.  It shows.  Their gestures are sweeping, their dialouge comes off as stiled onscreen, and their whole presentation is very ""showy"".  Contrast this to Roasrio Dawson's acting, which is very cinematic, capturing the sublte tones and small facial changes, and you have a problem.  She acts better, for this medium, and Mimi comes through stronger as a character.  Basically, the acting is not unified, and it's distracting.  (This is another reason why the original cast should have been dumped from this project).

Next, I felt like the movie was a little long, and the plot seemed to lose itself.  The last 45 minutes felt like they were singing the songs just to have them there in the movie, because they were in the show.  The plot becomes second priotiry, in service of singing a song, and then another, and another.  Yes, again, you may be saying this is a musical, what do you expect.  Well, I expect an adaptation for film.  What works onstage doesn't always work on film.  Chicago understood this, and it walked away with six Oscars and well over 150 million at the domestic box office, because it was modified to work so well with an audience as a film, and not a 'muscial on film'.

Good things?  This is Rent.  You should see it to have any exposure to this material, any way you can.  Rosario Dawson is incredible.  The music is amazing, and sounds better then ever.  Lastly, Chris Columbus, who has directed Rent, loves this show, and you can tell.  I admire his compassion for this project.

Yes, I picked a lot in this review, and they are all the small things that are 'wrong' about this film version of Rent, but overall, this is an impressive effot, and I encourage renting to newcomers, and purchasing for fans.",1137801600,,2613,4.528907922912206

All of the characters are amazing. Although I didn't see Daphne Vega on the original play, I believe Rosario Dawson was born to play as Mimi. And although critics say the rest of the cast was too old for their roles, I think they were perfect. I am so tired of seeing sixteen year olds every time I turn on the TV or go to the movies.

RENT is not only a play or a movie. RENT is an amazing experience. It makes me so greatful for life, health, and friends. It makes me not want to complain about anything, 'cause I'm not hungry or frozen; and I certainly don't have the kind of baggage these characters had. It makes me want to definitely measure my life in love.

Martin's performance is exceptional and adds to the excellence of this incredible movie musical.",1137628800,,474,4.9125
2717459,3,B000LXH0AY,"First I liked the stage version a lot.  I thought the whole Christmas Bells/It's Beginning to Snow sequence was brilliant.  It doesn't even show up in the movie.  First the good things: 6 of the original 8 leads from the original B'way production are in the movie playing the characters again.  Rosario Dawson makes a much better Mimi than Daphne Rubin-Vega (a great improvement -- I can't stand Rubin-Vega's mealy-mouthed delivery - it sounds like she's chewing her words, or maybe just the scenery).  The plot such as it is has been streamlined, though some of the songs tend to ramble on and outlive their welcome.  The bad: 6 of the 8 original cast members made the movie. Most look too damned old for the roles, except Anthony Rapp, who still has a baby face and probably could play Roger again when he's fifty. Adam Pascal's hair: he looks like Jon Bon Jovi caught out in the rain; I know this is a source of contention amongst female fans that a lot like him with the long hair, but long hair doesn't look right on a 35-year old, even if he's supposed to be a rocker. Much of the original recitatives have been turned into spoken dialogue which sounds flat. The ending seems forced, and I agree with one other reviewer: Roger's ""one great song"" is a dud. Pascal is best when he's ripping his voice to shreds, not crooning a sappy ballad.

Will I still buy the movie on DVD? Probably; it's better than most movies out there. But if you want the real Rent experience, go see the show on Broadway.",1137628800,,1501,4.476190476190476
2717460,5,B000LXH0AY,"Rent is so beautiful.  It deals with a lot of controversial topics, but the love in this film is amazing.  The cast is wonderful and the story is beautiful.  Rent is love and love is Rent, plain and simple.",1137456000,,206,4.230769230769231
2717470,5,B000LXH0AY,"Critics and movie civilians alike either love or hate Rent.  I have found no middle ground.  I fall into the former column.  I became obsessed with this musical ever since I saw Adam Pascal on Rosie 10 years ago.  The music was moving (I still maintain that One Song Glory is so much better than Roger's final song) and the story was both heart-warming, yet tragic.  I was thrilled to see a more modern musical to appeal to the younger masses.  I believe Rent introduced the art of the musical to a lot of Generation X and Y, at a time when kids are engrossed in video games and the internet.

I have seen Rent on stage and was thrilled to hear that they would be releasing a movie.  For 10 years, we had several scares (Justin Timberlake!) and I honestly cannot imagine how the casting and directing could have been better.  Having missed the original cast on stage, I was excited that I would get to experience the performers who first gave these characters life and dimension.  I was a little apprehensive about Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms at first (althought I loved Tracie in Wonderfalls).  They had big shoes to fill.  Not only do they fill the shoes, but they dance away in them.  Rosario lacks the vocal strength and enthusiasm of Daphne Rubin-Vega, but she holds her own (musically, and especially choreographically) with the seasoned cast and is surprisingly impressive.  The movie lacks a certain energy and character chemistry that was present on stage, however I was still moved by the performances and teary-eyed towards the end of the movie.

Many critics stated that the cast seems too old (as if no one in their 30s and 40s deals with love, poverty, and grief).  Other critics complain that the movie and its theme appears dated (well, the movie is set in 1989).  I didn't realize that homelessness and AIDs were ""dated"" causes.  I'll make sure to pass that on to an HIV+ homeless person.  Ignore the critics.  Buy the movie and make your own decision.  But don't stop there.  To get the full Rent experience, go see the musical on stage and bring a friend (someone has to hold your tissues as you applaud).",1137369600,,2128,4.588859416445623

My friend then dragged me to the movie theatre the day after RENT opened. I sat there, irritated, but decided to have an open mind. Wow. This movie is phoenominal, for lack of a better word. The characters were people you could relate to with the issues of surviving in the world: AIDS, paying the rent, drugs, just to name a few. I'm a senior in high school, and with going into the world soon, I have a better understanding of some problems people face thanks to this movie.

This movie, however, does deal with homosexuality, which did cause some uproar in theatres I went to seeing the movie five times. If you do not have an open mind, stay far away from this movie. It also deals with death, drug use, and some sexuality, so beware when showing it to a younger audience.",1137369600,,1039,4.242424242424242

2717475,4,B000LXH0AY,"Don't get me wrong.  This movie itself is really good in its own.  It is very moving and the soundtrack is incredible!  It just doesn't have the same impact as the theatre production.  The story seemed watered down.

I've seen the play 4 times and the movie twice so far.  One note is that the movie has a better soundtrack than the play's.  The production quality is amazing!  If you can get your paws on the 2-disc limited edition CD, I highly recommend it.  It's too bad that not all the songs from it are used in the film (that may be why it wasn't as impactful).  I hope those missing songs are in the deleted scenes at least.

It's great that 6 of the original 8 castmembers from the first Broadway production are in the film.  They did a great job.  And the newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms brought a lot to the film.

A Historical First for Hollywood: One thing that was really fun for the die-hard RENT-heads (like me) was that the film's website had an interactive BLOG for the fans to communicate with the actors and filmmakers during the making of the film.

The fact that Chris Columbus was able to get most of the original cast for this movie made it even more special.  Don't let the fact that the movie talks about AIDS influance you.  The topic is as relevent now as it was almost 10 years ago when the Broadway Play opened.  This movie shows how people live with diseases, being poor, and battle drug addiction, yet still are true to themselves, they are true friends and more of a family than some familys I know. And they fight to be better people everyday.  This movie makes grateful for what I have and makes me want to do more for others too.

So I was a little disappointed that I didn't love it instantly.  I do like it a lot, and I suspect that it will grow on me even more with subsequent viewings.  Therefore, I'll own the DVD.

The good news for other Rentheads is this:  the DVD will include ""Goodbye Love"" as an extra. According to Christopher Columbus' video blog on the official webpage, the movie didn't work with that scene.  He said it killed him to cut it (and that the editor, who suggested cutting the scene in the first place, cried as they took it out), but that the film works better without it.

I didn't even know that RENT was a musical movie( see how blind I was?!) I figured it out when MARK was riding his bike and singing ""RENT"", all I felt was I was gonna love this movie so much!! I've always loved (international)music, especially with the American-Point-Of-View lyrics. I feel that the music of RENT is the best I've ever heard in my life!(no kidding!)

The songs of ""Rent"" were all great; each was hugely entertaining, poignant or gripping for its part (my favorites were ""One Song Glory"" and ""What You Own""). I'd admit to a little bit of back-row sniffling if I weren't such a manly man. But to be honest, I hadn't realized how large a part homosexuality and AIDS played here (""East Village"" should have been warning enough) -- so if you're an avowed bigot then you might want to steer clear and preserve those delicate sensibilities. For everybody else...I'd say definitely give ""Rent"" a shot. As a picture of humanity (which most of us can relate to on some level) alone, it's time well spent.",1136851200,,863,4.39375

(It's a shame that Ebert, and the other critics ravaged this fine piece of work, that showcased Chris Columbus's best directing yet... and yet the Golden Globes and other critics loved the ghastly film version of ""The Producers"", the Globes providing it with nods for Best Pic, Actor, Supporting Actor, and Best Song.)

My personal wish for Sony is that you will release it on a collectors edition, and not go bare-bones with it. Please, please, please give the people who loved the film a joyous amount of material. Last years ""Phantom of the Opera"", if you remember, was similarly ravaged by critics, yet audiences found it, and while it didn't make a great amount of money at the box office (though 50 million is rather good nowadays), it became one of the top sellers this year at Amazon.com.

2717486,5,B000LXH0AY,"My hope is that when the DVD is released, many many more people will give this movie a chance. It's the most profound movie I've seen in my 57 years. For audiences on both sides who have critiques and agendas with this film, I say: Let go of fear, judgement and agendas and journey with these characters and you may be surprised what you DO find, not what you don't find. After seeing the movie for the 1st time I felt compelled to see it again ..and .again ..and.. again.. and.. again.. and.. again.. and.. again ..and.. again for a total of EIGHT TIMES.  Never in my life has this happened to me. Sometimes we find the most surprising things in the most unlikely places!

 As the story unfolded I fell in love with Angel & Collins.  They drew me in and never let go.  It was they who brought me back to the theater time and time again. Watching them I realized I wasn't watching the story of a gay couple in love, I was watching a story about LOVE! A subtle look, a small gesture, something all of us who have ever been in love recognize. When you see it, you recognize it and say AHAA!  THAT'S IT ! Then what seemed to be gender related love transcends to the UNIVERSAL. It doesn't get any better than this ! Judgement, Critiquing, Ideologies can't exist in this place! It's heartwrenchingly beautiful if you can get there.

I won't spoil it by getting into their full story, but I loved Angel whether he was playing on his pickle bucket with jeans, jacket & short hair,dancing & drumming her heart out in full drag, asking Collins to hold her puse while she picks up the trash can breaking the lock on the door with great gusto & nonchalantly retrieiving her purse,or the most poigniant scenes. I guess to me Angel was a complete human being. Not defined by gender. The term he/she is interchangeable. Angel seemed quite comforfortable in his/her own skin at each moment, and made no aplogies for it.

Mimi was the heroin addict...she came to represent the addictions in all of us.  We think HEROIN  AHHH! but what are our addictions?  Food? Smoking? Gambling? Over the counter medications or Physician prescribed medicines? or how about CONTROL?  We all have them but most of us think of ours as acceptable.

Maureen I had the toughest time with.  Took me awhile to warm up to her, maybe because I recognized her in our friends who have cheated on their spouses since day 1.

I eventually came ot love all these characters and feel they are my friends.  They remind me to have tolerance & compassion. They show me to look for beauty in the darkness.

(...)I encourage everyone to rent./ buy it. It is truly Jonathan Larson's gift to us.

2717497,5,B000LXH0AY,"I am shocked that a Pulitzer and Tony Award winning play about AIDS is getting so much flack for being a film musical about AIDS. Many complaints by moviegoers stem from the fact that the film is about homosexuality and AIDS and has (supposedly) been falsely advertised. These ignorant people have no doubt been living under a rock for the past ten years to not know what Rent is about. I can't believe they'd expect an entire 135 minute film about people who can't pay their rent? Please!

Rent is one of those movies that makes me realize why I love movies so much. It's passionate, energetic, fun, entertaining, touching, beautiful, and wonderfully romantic. It's everything a movie should be, and more. It's just one of those near-perfect movies that makes you laugh, cry, and want to dance. Once the film is over, it makes you want to see it again, and again, and again. This is the only movie I have ever wanted to see again once it was over, and the only one I bothered to see three times in the theatre (so far). Each time it kept getting better and better.

The songs are superb and add so much depth to the already terrific story, an update of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme."" ""Light My Candle"" is a brilliant and fabulous reimagining of the scene in La Boheme where Mimi and Rodolfo first meet. The beat is catchy and the lyrics are fabulous. It is one of my favorite songs in the film, probably a tie with the equally brilliant and wonderfully incorrect ""La Vie Boheme,"" the definite show-stopper in a film full of amazing songs.

What makes the film so great more than anything, is the fact that the story is so relatable. Gays, straights, and all those in-between will all find something to love in this movie. The cast all perform well and it was a smart choice to cast the original Broadway cast members in their original roles. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas are perfect substitutes for the only two members of the original cast who didn't return for the film.

In my opinion, Rent is by far the best, and most underrated and least appreciated movie of the year. I think it was lost in the Brokeback Mountain hype, but that film has nothing on this one. Brokeback Mountain was a horrid mess, while Rent is just simply an amazing film. This is one that keeps all those who have seen it flocking back to the theatre. It's really a shame that more people haven't discovered it. I know it's based on a 10 year old Broadway musical, but this is a truly revolutionary film for gay people, not Brokeback Mountain like everyone believes. I felt that had an offensive view of gay men as only being into rough sex. This one showed the tender side of gay relationships, and for that alone, it's a triumph!

It grabs you by the neck and pounds you in the gut till you cant stop crying at the very end of the credits.

The storyline is just....wow. The music is literally the best I have heard in my life, kudos to mister Larson. Although I find the music to be better in this one, I don't find the singing up to par with the musical. Rosario Dawson as Mimi is an excellent choice, as is Tracey Thoms as Joanne, but not as good as Daphne Ruben-Vega, or Freddi Walker. The singing in the musical, is overall better, though Rosario and Tracey have clearer voices, Daphnie's rather raspy has always been Mimi to me, and always will be. So if you're getting the soundtrack, get the OBCR. The only exception to my opinion, is La Vie Boheme, the extra music and guitar parts....wow. The only things I would say could have made this movie better would have been ALL the original cast members, and if the whole movie was in song (as the musical was). But we can't get everything we want. But, I say that this is a GREAT movie, get it when its released on DVD, or atleast RENT it.",1135296000,,1102,4.302884615384615

Although it's extremely difficult to transpose a stage production onto film, I think Columbus did a great job in doing so. Sure, some of the acting was a little ""larger-than-life"", but that's what one must do on stage. It was a huge gamble bringing back the original cast, mainly because it's so hard to dilute a bombastic stage personality into a more realistic film one. I have experience that firsthand. But despite all of this, I found the characters very real and very moving. They weren't developed as they could have been, but I haven't been that emotionally moved in a long time. What the storyline lacks, the universal message and wonderful music makes up for. It is definitely one of my favorite post-Webber musicals.",1135209600,,828,4.756944444444445

2717502,5,B000LXH0AY,"This movie is fantastic. It's a great substitute for the live show if you can't see it on stage and a wonderful souvenir for fans who want to relive the experience without having to shell over $50 and up for a seat. I will definitely buy the DVD when it releases. There were two things that that made this film magical for me. The first thing is the 3-dimensional, real world stage that RENT is filmed on. The stage show is basically one set but the movie has a real loft, a real performance space. They even made a Catscratch Club! It was so cool to see songs like ""Out Tonight"", ""Tango Maureen"", & ""One Song Glory"" expanded into these lavish production numbers. And even with all the various enviroments it still retains the essence of the stage show.

The second bonus was the fact that most of the film cast was comprised of the original stage cast. To see Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Jesse L. Martin, etc. reprise their roles was a blessing since I missed them on stage. I was worried about Rosario Dawson as Mimi but she did a great job (thank God) and the new Joanne was awesome too. I don't understand all the talk about the actors looking ""aged"". Who did the critics want to see? Hilary Duff?! The cast looked pretty vibrant and energetic to me. The actors' ages were the last thing on my mind when watching this film. I was too busy following the story and being awed by the musical performances to worry about who had the most crow's feet. I am just so grateful that I now have the faces to match the voices on the original cast recording of the RENT soundtrack. Yes!

A few criticisms like the sometimes wooden performances where the actor looks like he/she is focusing way too much on the lip synching and less on the emotional presentation. Like during the fight scene/song between Roger throws Mimi out of his apartment. I wish Adam looked as angry as his voice. Or maybe his hair was covering his anger? Luckily this incident happens rarely in the film. And as a huge fan of the soundtrack it was a little odd when some of the lines sung in the show or spoken in the film. Like when Collins visits Mark & Roger and offers them Stoli. It was supposed to be sung not spoken. It didn't hurt the movie very much but as a fan it took getting used to. Overall, this film was worth the wait and I'm glad that it's finally here and I'm ecstatic that it was done so well.

2717504,3,B000LXH0AY,"I loved the musical RENT - it caught you off-guard, and its characters inhabited their world with a gritty urban quality that is all but lost in the film version.  While the score is transferred nicely - the richest songs intact and sung expertly by the entire cast, including newcomer Rosario Dawson - the setting and staging of the story seems at times completely out of whack.  It all looks way too pretty for the lower East Side of the late '80s.  It is truly a ""fantasy world"", and once you decide to accept it on its own terms, you will have a good time.  But so much of the urgency in this story is now dated, and though the players give it their best, it seems an almost wildly overblown treatment of a rather simple musical.",1134345600,,733,4.328467153284672

And a bunch of folks completely unrepentant for the way that they act.
It's funny, it's sad, all set to music, it's truly obscene.
 It's liberal, it's queer, it's Sodom and Gomorrah depicted on the big screen.
It's about living each day, knowing it could be your last;
and setting aside the future and the past;
it's about no day but today, and love straight and gay, and friendships through hardship and holding your principals fast, about not selling out though your hungry and cold, and knowing that you won't live to grow old. A lot of people this idealism will offend, to say otherwise, I won't even pretend. But if you are a sinner, an artist, a liberal like me, this movie is truly one you must see. Viva La Boheme!

One reviewer claimed that the movie had nothing to do with the bohemian movement as they critisized the characters for not wanting to pay rent, insluting the 'yuppie scum' and feeling that they should only focus on there art. Now, I'm a bit confused by this review, who clearly does not approve of such things and also who clearly does not know what bohemian *means.* I'm tired of people who disaprove of the characters actions saying that it doesn't have anyhing to do with bohemia- because it does. They are trying to shoot the movie down in ways that are not accurate or truthful because they do not approve, and that is not in good faith. You want to disapprove- fine. Your disaproval does not make it *not* bohemian. Here is a little info from a website about bohemian lifestyle.

Although the bohemian population was diverse, one particular aspect of how they lived served as a unifying factor: the rejection of bourgeois values. The values they typically rejected and how are as follows:

They rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth.
They rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom.
They rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not.
Members of Bohemia often adopted a communal lifestyle, sharing lodging with other Bohemian companions. They often carried around a few luxury or decorative items that served to spruce up a drab living space for a night of celebration.
The bohemian life was carefree. As part of their rebellion against ""genteel"" society, bohemians felt no reason to exhibit moral or socially acceptable behavior. One participant, Houssaye, printed in his memoirs, ""We were afraid of nothing and thumbed our noses at public opinion. . .The most outstanding characteristic of our Bohemian existence was our open revolt against all prejudices, I might say against all laws. We lived as if entrenched in a fortress from which we made belligerent sallies ridiculing everything.""
Bohemians tended to indulge in alcohol as well as drug experimentation. In fact, drugs were used by many to supposedly help with inspiration. Bohemians were also overtly promiscuous, in contrast to how the bourgeois obscured this facet of their lives.
In contrast to the Bourgeois preoccupation with obtaining wealth and status, the bohemian life was characteristically idle; idle in the sense that they did nothing that yielded material wealth. A friend of Houssaye said, ""I don't do any work, on the pretext of writing a poem; and I write a poem to have an excuse for not doing anything.""
Bohemians felt the need to express and assert themselves, being at such a social and economic disadvantage. It was almost as if they flaunted their marginality; by practicing an alternative and contrasting lifestyle, bohemians undermined the bourgeois.

2717506,1,B000LXH0AY,"This movie was nothing short of distastful and disgusting. There were children in the theatre for goodness sake! The amount of sexuality and drug use portrayed in this film should have warrented AT LEAST an ""R"" rating! If not ""X"".

We're talking EXPLICIT strip club scenes, syringes, transvestites, heavy GRAPHIC drug usage, sexual situations, death, and VERY foul language.

Adults can subject themselves at their own will, but children should NOT be allowed to see this in the theatres. I am sure many regretful parents have gotten out of their seats mid-film, to remove their now-scarred children from this hell-hole of a movie. They go in with the intention of educating their children both culturally and socially with a Broadway musical, and come away trying to explain how people can possibly justify such deranged behavior.

I understand the value it holds in terms of awareness for AIDS education. The manner in which the storyline was performed, however, was a bit much. People should be able to know what they are getting themselves into when they purchase a movie ticket. Several co-workers of mine feel the same way. They had no idea what they were going to see in this movie. The previews and trailers were VERY misleading!

2717509,5,B000LXH0AY,"I went to the film version this past weekend and was blown away.  Not only did I find the film extremely powerful, but in a way, it was able to capture the small things a person can miss when seeing the play in a large theatre.  Yes, one does miss the live interaction of Broadway, the intense energy that comes from a live performance.  But the movie version of RENT delivers every single emotion the theatre performance has...and occasionally, I think it delivers those emotions with a bit more of a punch.

The six original cast members reclaim their roles with authority, and the two newcomers live up to the extremely high bar set by the veterans.

The story is powerful, the music is emotional, combined it's an amazing experience.  A must-see movie.  I know I will be one of the first in line when the DVD is available.",1133740800,,826,4.503355704697986
2717510,5,B000LXH0AY,"I did not see the play and all I knew about this film going into it was the song ""Seasons of Love."" At first, it was kinda rough going after seeing/hearing the title song, but the film really grew on me for what it is. Yeah, I admittedy was thrown off a bit with some of the subject matter which has been discussed to death here, but I was not offended. It strikes me as a testament to the human spirit that this group of social outcasts, scorned by most people bond toggether as friends and as a family against their inevitable ends.

Perhaps it's just as well that I didn't see the original play and did not have it to compare with the film. I love this movie, although I wouldn't take the kiddies to it.

Now that the DVD is finally out and I snapped it up right away, some additional commentary is necessary. The deleted scenes are quite interesting, as is often the case with a movie that you like. The alternate ending is triumphant, if a tad cornball and it's just as well, considering Angel's character, that they didn't use it (I won't spoil it, see and you'll understand). But it's still interesting as a bonus feature. The documentary about Jonathan Larson is very revealing, if a tad overlong (the behind the scenes stuff about the film would have worked better as a seperate feature) and overall, the entire package holds together well (including some of the original stage cast memebers who did not return for the movie. I like the fact they weren't excluded and we get to compare them with Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms), making the ""Rent"" DVD an essential and worthwhile purchase.",1133740800,,1598,4.506896551724138

2717512,5,B000LXH0AY,"Inspired by Puccini's ""La Boh&egrave;me,"" the musical movie version of Rent revolves around a group of late Eighties down-and-out young artists living in the part of the Lower East Side known locally as Alphabet Soup (for Avenues A, B, C, and D). It's one of the lowest-rent districts in Manhattan, but they still can't afford their rent.

They can't find work in their quirky fields. They face straight and gay love problems and meanwhile (also) the realities of living with AIDS, which afflicts four of the eight key characters. Still, their boundless love and hope carry them through.

The stage version of Rent won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Obie Award, the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, four Tony Awards and three Drama Desk awards, alas too late for composer Jonathan Larson to appreciate his success: he died of an aortic aneurysm the night before the show's first off-Broadway performance.

After 10 years on Broadway, the show has attracted a huge following--many of whom have seen it several times. But you don't need to have seen the original Broadway musical to enjoy this film: There's singing and dancing on the streets, on fire-escapes, on table-tops and in subway cars. It all enchantingly carries the plot along.

Director Chris Columbus recast six actors in the roles they played when the stage show opened--Anthony Rapp as filmmaker Mark Cohen, Idina Menzel as performance artist Maureen Johnson, Adam Pascal as songwriter Roger, Jesse L. Martin as computer programmer Tom Collins, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as drag queen drummer Angel and Taye Diggs as the landlord's son-in-law Benny Coffin III. All six perform with amazing panache. The two newcomers--Rosario Dawson as exotic dancer and drug addict Mimi Marquez and Tracie Thoms as an attorney and Maureen's lesbian lover Joanne Jefferson--are equally alluring.

The film opens with ""Seasons of Love."" The entire cast sings of the importance of every moment. Then ""Rent"" sets the story flowing. Mark Cohen is off to making films of friends and his neighborhood before running home to find Roger and Tom Collins asking them to throw down the key. Before getting upstairs, Tom is attacked by thugs. Angel, drumming on a plastic can in the street, hears him moaning and comes to his rescue in a nearby alleyway, thus setting off the film's gay love affair.

Mimi flirts with Roger in ""Light My Candle"" and although he rejects her with ""Another Day,"" she comes back again in ""Out Tonight."" Tom and Angel go to their AIDS support group, which sings of overcoming their fears in ""Will I?"" Mark commiserates with Joanne in ""The Tango Maureen."" The cast lauds their happy-go-lucky lifestyle in ""La Vie Boheme."" Angel and Tom fall for one another in ""I'll Cover You."" And Roger reclaims a chance with Mimi in ""Your Eyes.""

There's a lot of entertainment, and some lessons for life packed into this beauty of a film. See it.

2717513,2,B000LXH0AY,"This movie will please any die hard Broadway musical fan. But this movie will not convert an average movie goer into liking a musical movie form. This movie dragged on and on. I'd rather see this as a musical play. The songs aren't even catchy except the ballad song at the end of the movie. This is suppose to be a rated R movie but is rated PG-13.  The movie showed people  dying of AIDS, lesbian relationships, actors freely talking about drugs and showing syringes, and a drag queen. And no i'm no saint. I'm liberal and gay but this movie should've been a rated R movie. Come on. How corrupt is that. Horror movies are always getting axed for being rated R and getting a edited watered down PG-13.  But non-horror movies have alot of sexual suggestions, bad language (yes the S word and the F word), and heavy violence but are rated PG-13. The Bad News Bears 2005 remake had a lot of foul bad language coming out of the mouths of child actors but was still PG-13???

2717514,3,B000LXH0AY,"But the performances in the movie RENT are excellent.  The singing is great, some of the vocal arrangements are great, and it's because of those great performances that I give this movie 3 stars.

But aside from that, I don't think I like musicals.  I checked my watch 3 or 4 times during the film.  To me, musicals are a bit silly.  I mean, SINGING IN THE RAIN is a musical.  The songs are great songs and they're central to the show.  In RENT, the songs were just dialogue sung to a tune.  I'm watching the movie, there's narrative and action going on and then BAM! they burst into song.  It seems a bit silly to me.  The production should have made up its mind whether it was a movie or a musical.  I know it was a movie OF a musical, but for me, I wasn't buying it.

However, the performances were excellent.  Angel and Mimi were my favorite characters.  Although the show was conceived 20 years ago when we were constantly inundated with news about AIDS, today it seems ironic that the movie feels dated simply because AIDS is no longer a news item in spite of the fact that more people than ever have the virus.  But that's not RENT's fault.

In the very beginning of the movie, you go through 5 credits before RENT appears on the screen.  Articles in the LA Times say this mess is why it took so long for the musical to make it to the screen.  I'm glad it made it; like it or not, RENT is a part of American pop culture landscape, even if it does feel a bit dated.

Go see it.  It's 2 hours 15 minutes out of your life.  Or should I say 135 minutes out of the total 525,600 minutes this year?",1133654400,,1599,4.143322475570033
2717515,5,B000LXH0AY,"Suffice it to say that the movie version of ""Rent"", nine years after it exploded on Broadway, delivers the goods in late 2005. That in itself is no small feat since its then-topicality brings the story a somewhat tainted 1990's time capsule feel. Credit needs to go to director Chris Columbus, who has the audacity to bring back six of the eight original cast members and does surprisingly little to alter the story structure for the screen. The late Jonathan Larson's energetic, hook-heavy music is what made the show so memorable to me when I saw it during its first year in New York, and the now-familiar score still maintains its searing drive as it flows through the episodic story of almost starving artists living in the squalor of Manhattan's Alphabet City in 1989 with the AIDS epidemic running rampant (currently the neighborhood is going through significant urban renewal). In fact, four of the eight main characters are HIV-positive, and this makes the story resonate as much as the vital music does today.

Having the cast return to roles they originated nearly a decade earlier when they epitomized twenties angst is a risky move as the characters would seem to be less compelling inhabited by actors now in their mid-thirties. As it turns out, age is not the issue versus the ability of the actors to generate the excitement they did onstage. Their contributions at minimum are solid and effervescent with some standing out, for example, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, the geeky documentary filmmaker who records the lives of his friends with candor and regret. Jesse L. Martin - he of the dazzling smile and honey-coated baritone - seems genuinely liberated from years of button-down civility on ""Law and Order"" to play computer programmer Tom Collins smitten with drag queen Angel portrayed with unbridled pride and poignancy by Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Martin's and Heredia's giddy duet, ""I'll Cover You"", is full of such romantic fervor that other more traditional couplings can only aspire to such dizzying heights.

Idina Menzel plays the bisexual performance artist Maureen Johnson with real brio though she seems a bit over-the-top even when not performing her supposedly avant-garde work, ""Over the Moon"". Despite nailing his passionate solo, ""One Song Glory"", Adam Pascal looks somewhat lost in his portrayal of Roger Davis, the tortured singer-songwriter who begrudgingly falls for Mimi Marquez, the borderline junkie/exotic dancer downstairs. With her saucer eyes and flirty demeanor, Rosario Dawson replaces original Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and she turns out to be an excellent choice, showing off unseen singing and dancing skills within the context of the most screen-savvy performance of the cast. She does an appropriately saucy turn on the showstopper, ""Out Tonight"". Rounding out the principal cast are another newcomer, Tracie Thoms, a belter who plays Maureen's lover yuppie lawyer Joanne Jefferson (and consequently wails with immaculate bravura the bridge to the show's most famous song, ""Seasons of Love""), and Taye Diggs, who manages to make the most of the relatively thankless role of Benny Coffin.

No matter the variability of the acting, everyone sings with glorious power, a fact made clear at the outset by Columbus, who smartly has them sing ""Seasons of Love"" in the manner it was introduced onstage with spotlights on a darkened stage. He also takes cinematic liberties which work in some of the numbers retranslated into the film, such as ""Light My Candle"", ""Tango: Maureen"" and ""Take Me As I Am"". Some like the centerpiece ensemble, ""La Vie Boheme"", work almost the same way they did on stage with its sheer exuberance intact. Some scenes don't work as well, for example, ""What You Own"" where Roger is literally living out the symbolic lyrics in Santa Fe. With its more naturalistic tone in spite of the numerous breaks into song and dance, the movie reminds me less of Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbins' adaptation of ""West Side Story"" than of Milos Forman's take on ""Hair"". Be forewarned that those who loved the stage version are the ones who will most be in thrall over the film version. That would include me.",1133654400,,4164,5.058224163027656
2717516,5,B000LXH0AY,"I have never made a movie review- I usually wait until the movie comes to DVD before bashing it or praising it... but, this movie was EXTRAORDINARY. I just left the theater and the songs, feelings, and emotions are still playing in my head and right now I am so close to tears it is unbelievable. This is the best movie I have seen in years! And in my opinon is the last good show Broadway has ever done.

I didn't become a ""RENT"" fan until seeing this AMAZING movie. Hearing the songs, the feelings of wanting to not be forgotten, and having someone to love you is are at the true heart of this movie. After the third song, I felt like all the characters in the movie were somehow friends of mine... and we have know eachother forever. Feeling comfortable with the characters and their feelings of inaddiqesce made me feel like I was going on this journey with them.

A perfect cast with all your favorites from the orginal Broadway show. Each one of them perfectly cast in their role... give inspirational renditions of the songs that brought them to fame and inspiring performances!  Anthony Rap manages to somehow stand out among them though as though he is the ""firm root"" of their friendship- and sings powerful while adding comic relief when needed.

All about trying to find yourself and express yourself in the 90s... no matter what your living is you'll be able to relate wether a doctor or an underrated actor. No matter what you'll love the movie. Relate to feelings of wanting something more while having to deal with ""real world"" issues such as paying rent, drugs, and diease. On a bad day ""Rent"" is considered the ""Hair"" of the 90s. Taking place when AIDs was virtually a fatal diease... you see the affliction and feel the pain for those in this movie afflicted. While you only lose one of those who follow you on the journey of these friends you can truly feel sad for those other characters you have met that are afflicted.

I found myself falling in love with all of them as though they were actual friends... The soundtrack to the movie may in fact be better than the actual Broadway version.  This movie musical will NOT dissappoint the fans of the orginal and may actual outshine the Broadway performances. With inspirational music and a great cast to match...""Rent"" can't go wrong even the least fanatical musical fan will be impressed.

All in all wether your a Broadway fan, a music buff, or just want to see a great movie ""Rent"" is all you need! Get the friends together and go be AMAZED by the power of ""RENT.""  And please keep your fingers crossed for some Oscar nominations here!",1133568000,,2608,4.545842217484009

The movie does have flaws, of course - most of the cast does appear to be far too old for their roles, but they all turned in strong performances in the end.  There's also a scene with Roger (Adam Pascal) in the desert in New Mexico that brings Bon Jovi to mind, but the rest of the movie remains strong with most of the original cast.  The new additions (Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms as Mimi and Joanne respectively) were possibly better than the cast I saw on stage.  Rosario Dawson was killer in her role.

2717519,5,B000LXH0AY,"I was born to love ""Rent.""  Having grown up listening to my mother's record of ""La Boheme"" playing as she did her housework, I anxiously anticipated seeing the Broadway production when I was in New York in 1999.  Although, it was superb, the movie version was so much more enjoyable to me, mainly because the words to the beautiful songs were clear and much more understandable.  I realize Broadway is a one-shot deal and a movie can have countless takes on a scene, so I'm not putting down the play I loved in any way, just saying the movie was an easier and more enjoyable viewing experience.

From the spectacular opening scene where the full cast sings the beautiful ""Seasons of Love,"" the stage is set for a glorious celebration of life, living it to the fullest, and enjoying every moment.  Yes, there is heartbreak on the screen and many moist eyes in the theater, but this is mainly a joyful story of friendship, love, and reaching out to your fellow man.

The acting is superb, lovingly done by actors who obviously relate to their roles in a profound way.  Wilson Jermaine excels as Angel, especially in the show-stopping ""Today 4 U.""  Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are believable as the romantic leads and Jesse L. Martin will astound his ""Law and Order"" fans with his rich singing voice and dancing ability.  All the cast is marvelous, the show is electric with its high-energy singing and dancing, and overall, the best movie I have seen in a long, long time.

2717520,4,B000LXH0AY,"I will admit first off that I am not a Rent-o-phile. I have never seen the musical although I do know that the musical, now entering its tenth season on Broadway, has had more guest performers than the entire run of the Love Boat. I know it is supposed to be based on the play/book La Boheme, which I know nothing about. I also know the creator, Jonathon Larson, died before the show hit Broadway. I also know the show won a Pulitzer for best drama, and a slew of 1996 Tony Awards. During the 1996-1997 Broadway season, I saw another innovative show that critics loved--Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk. From the Broadway: The American Musical compilation CD, I knew the popular song Season of Life from Rent. However, I didn't discover that until winter 2004. Needless to say, I went into the movie not knowing much about the plot of the show, but looking to be entertained and not disappointed by the film adaptation.

I was not disappointed with Rent...the movie although it was directed by Chris Columbus (who ruined Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets for me). Out of four stars, I give it three solid stars. However, I should delve into the flaws before I heap on the praise. That would only be fair.

Rent is a time capsule of a New York City that no longer exists. As a matter of fact, the NYC that Rent takes place in didn't even exist when the show hit Broadway. In 1995, AIDS was no longer a death sentence and phrases like ""living with AIDS"" were the norm. AZT was replaced with Protease Inhibitors. The heart of NYC bohemia, SoHo and Greenwich Village, became filled with Yuppies who were the only ones able to afford the soaring rents (no pun intended).

In the Giuliani era of NYC, Times Square and 42nd Street was cleaned of its charm. The hookers, the homeless (Squeegee Men), and drug addicts had been bulldozed out of sight by the corporate sponsors and family entertainment. Even the gays and lesbians seemed less threatening as they became more and more a marketing niche as opposed to a hated and disenfranchised population. And ironically enough, Rent came to Broadway stage at a time when Broadway was starting to sell out its soul to Disney, Hollywood actors (no offense Hugh Jackman), and musical tracks instead of real life musicians.

Rent was dated when it became a hit, but somehow it works. It works on stage and works on the screen. As a native New Yorker who remembers dirty streets, crack heads, graffiti-ed subways, and the squatters and tent cities in Tompkins Square Park, Rent is a beautiful reminder that New York is good even when it is really bad. It's full of youthful ambition and a will to succeed even when the odds are stacked against you. Death, sickness, poverty, and hunger are the prices one must pay to live out their dreams. Rent is about fulfilling dreams when everything works against you. It's also, as the Seasons of Life eludes, about love and living for only today.

Except for the lesbian lawyer Joanne, played by Tracie Thomas, and erotic dancer Mimi, played by a feline sexy Rosario Dawson, everyone in the movie are holdovers from the original stage production. Some critics say that they are too old to be playing characters that are at least 10 years younger. I don't hold their age against them--is there a time limit on optimism, ambition, dreams? You'll recognize Jesse L. Martin from his stint on Law and Order; Taye Diggs from How Stella Got Her Groove Back; and Diggs' wife, Idina Menzel from her Tony-award winning stint in Broadway's Wicked.

I was wholly moved by the plot, the acting, the singing, and of the NYC of long ago. I sat until the end of the credits singing along until finally the lights came up. I knew in my heart that I would be buying the original Broadway soundtrack and movie soundtrack and the DVD when it came out. I hope the movie gets an Oscar nod for best picture, best movie score, and that Rosario Dawson gets an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.

What I found was music, love, friendship, sadness, and a final feeling of hope. My two favorite songs were Seasons of Love and Will I Lose My Dignity / No Day But Today / Finale, because to me they completely encompassed the meaning of the show/movie. It's about living each day like it's your last, but being wary all the way, yet having the hope to continue *living*. Period. And for that, I adored it.

I don't know about the play production, but I can't see any flaws in the movie. Washy characters? Heck no. Bad music? Impossible. Non-mainstream topics? Okay, but that only adds to the atmosphere!

2717524,3,B000LXH0AY,"""Rent"" is art triumphing over reason, aided by extremely catchy music. It's cute despite its relative absurdity, which is heightened on a movie screen, a canvas easier to scrutinize than a stage, where the musical ""Rent"" has enjoyed an extraordinary run on Broadway.

Employing all the songs from Johnathan Larson's original production - based on the opera ""La Boheme"" - and using six of the original cast members, ""Rent"" tells the tale of seven New Yorkers living in and around Alphabet City amidst art, drugs and AIDS. Set in 1989, the friends are rallying against landlord Benny (Taye Diggs) and his attempt to close down their rent-free tenement and reopen it as some kind of cyberstudio. Benny would like to employ his old roommates, filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) and musician Roger (Adam Pascal), to stop a protest by performance artist Maureen (Idina Metzel), who dumped Mark for uptown lawyer Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is a club dancer with her eye on Roger, while Tom (Jesse L. Martin) is another friend mugged in the street and nursed back to health by a street drummer/queen named Angel (Jermaine Wilson Heredia). Both have AIDS, as do Roger and Mimi.

Director Chris Columbus opens up the musical by staging certain numbers at various New York landmarks - the subway, Central Park - and creating an elaborate set for Maureen's performance. Music comprises 90 percent of the film, the better to gloss over a gossamer story that requires the characters to fall immediately, joyously in love and use Benny as a convenient villain who emerges more as a prompt for conflict or song - it's his words that touch off ""La Vie Boheme"" - than a character.

Metzel, in the smallest of the main roles as Maureen, is shrill, flirty, funny and generally excellent, willing to give her character a shade of selfish, and Rapp turns in a old-school showman's performance, all passion and gesticulation; it reminded me of Sam Rockwell's work in ""Confessions of Dangerous Mind."" The other cast members are suffering saints, led by Mimi, played by Dawson as a dangerous-but-sweet minx. ""Rent"" assaults Roger from all angles to date this dying heroin addict half his age who's been on the street since she was 17 and used to date Benny. Think about that for a minute.

Or don't. Roger and Mimi's courtship does, after all, include two of the best songs, ""Light My Candle"" and ""Another Day,"" the end of which is the first full belting of the mantra of ""Rent,"" ""no day but today."" The idea: Live solely in the moment, loving those you're with, making friends and art  your family. While it's more of a defensive, desperate life philosophy than I think anybody should live by, the characters believe it and are eventually rewarded by it. Thoms, as Joanne, probably has the best, full-bodied voice; Dawson has the weakest, but also the easiest on the ears. They might have affected Rentheads another way, but Tom and Angel seemed to me disposable; their relationship is goofy, slight and coy. Angel is meant to be an emotional anchor, but he comes off as a plucky sidekick.",1133308800,,3079,4.844106463878327
2717525,3,B000LXH0AY,"Being the good homosexual theater student that I am, I patiently waited for five-hundred twenty-five-thousand six-hundred minutes for the film version of Rent. Of course my expectations were high since almost the entire Broadway cast reunited for the film, and the film soundtrack (in my opinion) is much more enjoyable than the Original Broadway Cast recording. Sadly though, the film version of Rent made me more disappointed than seeing a horribly miscast and untalented thirty-something play the title role in last year's film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera.

So what turned this Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning piece of theater into the worst film adaptation of a musical since A Chorus Line? I'd start by blaming virtually unknown screenwriter Steve Chbosky and director Chris Columbus as both obviously do not understand what the original stage version is all about.

(...)
Still, Rent is somewhat redeemed by its brilliant cast. ""Law and Order"" alum Jessie L. Martin gives a charming performance as Collins. His rendition of the heart-wrenching reprise to ""I'll Cover You"" is enough to win him a Golden Globe nomination. Other stand-outs are Tony Winner Idina Menzel's energetic and hilarious performance as the trashy, constantly horny bisexual Maureen. Her rendition of the monologue/song/performance art piece ""Over the Moon"" is both nonsensical and laugh-out-loud funny all at once. And Tracie Thoms as Maureen's sophisticated, Ivy-League lesbian lover Joanne gives a brilliantly understated and demure performance. Their fierce duet, ""Take Me or Leave Me"" is easily one of the most enjoyable moments of the film, as is Thoms's duet with Antony Rapp's Mark in the ""Tango: Maureen."" But the biggest surprise of the bunch is Rosario Dawson as the optimistic yet HIV positive junkie, Mimi. Who knew that she could sing or dance? At any rate, she is a joy to watch, and her striptease number ""Out Tonight"" is a high point of the film.

Despite the enjoyable performances by the cast, Rent is plagued by bad writing, directing, and editing. As I watched this train wreck I could picture the producers of the upcoming adaptations of Dreamgirls and Hairspray cowering in a corner. My advice when it comes to Rent: save your money for The Producers, which will hopefully follow in the footsteps of better recent musicals like Moulin Rouge and Chicago. And if you must see Rent, well consider that renting that seat in the movie theater costs a lot more than renting the DVD will.",1133308800,,2497,5.085365853658536
2717526,1,B000LXH0AY,"""Rent"" is the story of eight New Yorkers from Christmas Eve 1989 to Christmas Eve 1990.  Those New Yorkers include Mimi (Dawson), a stripper who got HIV from sharing needles; Tom Collins (Martin), a gay man with HIV; Angel (Heredia), a transvestite with HIV; Roger (Pascal), a musician who also got HIV from sharing needles; and Mark (Rapp), a filmmaker who is trying to catch a break.  When old friend Benny (Diggs), the guy who owns the tenement that they all live in, threatens to evict them unless they start paying rent, they begin to worry about what the future holds for them.

""Rent"" is based on the popular musical of the same name and stars most of the original Broadway cast.  That is probably the greatest thing I can say about this movie, and I applaud the filmmakers for getting the cast to reprise their roles.  After all, they are the ones who made the characters what they are.  The music is OK, the stand out song being ""Seasons of Love"".  Of course, that is the first song, and the rest of the songs are lesser in comparison, so it is all downhill song-wise from there.  The story is maddening, as these lazy people struggle to live rent-free so that they can just enjoy life.  While I appreciate their desire to enjoy the time they have, I hated the characters for doing it at the expense of others.

I did not like this movie.  I suppose to see it live is more impressive, and that may be enough to overshadow the dumb story, but that does not work in movie form.  This is for die hard fans of the musical only.  Otherwis, stay away!",1133308800,,1554,4.410526315789474
2717527,4,B000LXH0AY,"I thought this movie was great. It truly expressed in so many ways the true meaning of friendship and the struggles they went through.

2717528,3,B000LXH0AY,"I was never able to see the musical ""Rent"" performed live on stage. This seems to be an ongoing trend with me. Every acclaimed musical that comes to town is always gone before I get a chance to see it. It took me almost a decade to finally catch ""Phantom of the Opera"" on stage, and then only because I was living in London and it was still playing there. So, I was happy to learn that a film version of the popular Broadway musical about a bunch of starving artists living in Manhattan's East Village would be made with many of the original cast members. It seemed a natural fit that Robert DeNiro would produce the project, a musical set on the mean streets of New York. Then more of the cast and crew were announced and my hopes began to deflate.

The film is directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Harry Potter 1 and 2"", ""Bicentennial Man"") and produced by Revolution Studios. Danger, Will Robinson. Danger. Columbus has made a series of amazingly successful films, but that doesn't mean they were necessarily good films. ""Harry Potter 1 and 2"" were good films, but as we now see, the films in the series can and are so much better now that other directors have taken over. He tends to make more `family friendly' broad comedies featuring a well-known comedian (i.e., Robin Williams) and a `hook' (i.e., a man poses as a nanny to be close to his children during the divorce). Columbus doesn't seem like a good match with the material. Revolution Studios has produced an amazingly long series of just plain terrible films, stretching across every genre and engulfing many good actors in the wake. Their most successful and critically acclaimed film was Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk Down"", but one film does not make up for even a small portion of the series of duds they have perpetrated on the public. ""America's Sweethearts"" anyone?

""Rent"", as a film, works, but much like the first two ""Harry Potter"" films, it doesn't transcend. I am doubtful that this musical will become a classic like the great musicals of the 40s and 50s, or even as well-remembered as the Disney animated musicals like ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"". But it is a good film.

My main difficulty is that a number of the songs are difficult to hear, songs featuring the character Roger (Adam Pascal). Roger, a former rising musician, now living with AIDS, the product of a drug habit, lives with Mark (Anthony Rapp), a budding documentary filmmaker, in a run-down loft in the lower East Side of Manhattan. Freezing, hungry and frustrated, their landlord turns the power off on Christmas Eve, leaving them, literally, in the dark. When Roger sings a song, either alone, or to another person, the background music takes on an edgier, rocker mood, drowning out a lot of his lyrics, making it difficult to understand him.

When any of the other characters are the centerpiece of a particular song or ballad, the accompanying music is much more musical-like, allowing the lyrics to be heard. It seems odd that one character's songs should be different from the rest and I am not sure why this was done, but it really detracts from the experience.

""Rent"", written by Jonathan Larson, who died shortly before the play premiered on Broadway, is a modern day interpretation of Puccini's opera ""La Boheme"", which was also the loose inspiration for Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"". Now, I know what I am about to say will make a number of people mad, but ""Moulin Rouge"" was a much better film. Even with all of the excessive editing and the loud shouting, I was able to understand every word of the music, the acting, everything. In ""Rent"", this simply isn't the case. Please keep in mind I am only comparing the films. I'm sure watching ""Rent"" performed live on stage is a completely different experience.

The main difference between ""Rent"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" is that ""Rent"" was initially produced as an Operatic musical. From what I understand, the play was pretty much all music, all singing, and no spoken dialogue. Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steven Chbosky have added a little bit of dialogue throughout and this is not entirely successful. This dialogue may help establish the characters a little more, but it seems odd to hear so much singing and then have the characters speak a few lines of dialogue before returning to singing. The characters speaking in their normal voices takes you out of a world where everyone is singing all of the time, jarring you back into reality. Then when they start singing again, it takes a few moments to get back into the cadence of the song. It seems sloppy.

The new addition to the cast is Rosario Dawson. Six of the other seven members of the cast originated their roles in the Broadway production. Dawson plays Mimi Marquez, a heroin addicted exotic dancer, and gives perhaps the most believable performance. She is the newcomer to the group and as we witness her character through their eyes, we see a more fully realized arch for her character. They meet her, learn about her, deal with some of her problems and then become close to her. She becomes attracted to Roger, which adds gravitas to his character as the recovering addict has to help Mimi with her addiction, bringing back memories of his own problems. It is Dawson's best performance in a few years.

The other standout is Wilson Jermaine Heredia who plays the transvestite Angel. Wilson won a Tony for the same role on Broadway and he clearly knows his way around the character. He makes Angel more real than some of the other characters. At times, we feel empathy and sadness, and at others, we feel his joy for life. It is a real stand out performance.

The rest of the cast is good. Anthony Rapp plays Mark, the budding documentary filmmaker who always carries a camera around, recording events as they happen to him and his friends. All of this footage is for a documentary he is working on, which he ultimately finishes and shows to the collected group. The camera has no microphone, so he seems to be making a silent documentary, using a jumble of pictures and images to tell his story. The finished project seems like a bad student project from high school, but maybe that's just me.

Jesse L. Martin (TV's ""Law and Order"") plays Collins, a friend of Mark and Roger who returns to New York to teach and deal with his own case of AIDS. He meets Angel and they begin a relationship. His character is the least interesting to me, because he spends the majority of the film walking around smiling and laughing, because he is so happy in his relationship with Angel. His character experiences the least growth, making him the least interesting. Idina Menzel (who played the Wicked Witch in ""Wicked"" recently on Broadway), plays Maureen and does a good job with the role of the flirtatious Bi- former girlfriend of Mark.

Because this is a musical, you expect a certain amount of the film to take place in interior settings, but Columbus stages many of the outdoor scenes on what appear to be sets as well. With the advancement of technology, it seems like it would be fairly easy to shoot exteriors in real locations. But Columbus apparently doesn't agree. At one point Roger travels to Santa Fe, and these scenes are clearly shot outdoors in real locations. They stand out like a sore thumb because they are so different from the rest of the film. Clearly, that is the point, but they don't appear to belong to the same film.

""Rent"" will clearly appeal to devoted fans of the stage version, but if you have never seen the stage play you may have some trouble accepting Columbus' interpretation of the material.",1133222400,,7617,4.697378277153558
2717529,5,B000LXH0AY,"For those who have experienced ""Rent"" on the stage, I have no doubt that the movie lacks that element of intimacy one can only experience in live theatre.  Since I've not seen ""Rent"" on the stage, I have to say I was totally blown away.

The music is fierce, the story incredibly uplifting in its own way, always seeking a place of hope, knowing that we can be better.

Can't wait to go see it again, can't wait to buy the DVD.  LOVE IT!  I'd recommend ""Rent"" over ""Walk the Line.""  This was infinitely better.",1133222400,,510,4.315789473684211
2717530,4,B000LXH0AY,"It's brash and bold.  It's a celebration of life and yet it is also the tragedy that is AIDS invading a small community of East Village young people in the late 1980s.  Adapted from the musical which has played on Broadway for ten years, this is a film that puts the viewer in a time and place that is no more.  New York has changed.  And the lifestyles depicted are a curious remnant of what used to be.

The cast is great.  All eight of the leads do fantastic jobs.  In spite of the fact that everyone is singing and dancing all the time, there is a gritty realism in every scene.  And each cast member is so different from each other that it is easy to see them as individuals:  the transvestite and his lover; the fledging filmmaker; the guitar playing songwriter; the fiery woman with both male and female lovers and her upscale lesbian lover; the heroin addicted exotic dancer.  And then there is the yuppie sellout who has come to collect a year of back rent.  It's a sad and strange and yet joyful story.

The music wasn't memorable.  It was basically a backdrop for the storyline and the deep characterization.  I didn't care because I got caught up in the story.  My eyes stayed dry though;  I didn't feel a real emotional connection. But I was left with an appreciation for the people who brought the play first to the stage and then to film.",1133222400,,1353,4.373493975903615
2717531,3,B000LXH0AY,"I saw RENT live in all it's spectacular glory on the stage in 1999 and was overwhelmed with tears, laughter and elation at such a fabuous piece of art. I fell in love - and purchased the soundtrack the next day. Fast forward to present day - I was so excited about this movie coming out I was literally counting down the days. I wanted to fall in love all over again - but was deeply dissapointed.

I understand the challenge in bringing a musical to the screen. When I saw A Chorus Line on the stage I was moved to explore the world of dance. When I saw the movie I was literally dancing to my car. When I saw RENT on stage I was crying tears of joy as I left the theater and singing the tunes aloud. When I saw the movie I simply sighed.

Don't get me wrong, the performance everyone gave was superb. These are people with amazing talents and incredible voices. But honestly, if they had just done the performance on stage and recorded it I would have been so much happier. This would have even worked if it had been done in the same way an independant film is done. But this was all slick and hollywood and it really made me sad. The whole beauty of the musical seemed to be somewhat corrupted. I also did not like how lines sung in the stage performance are spoken in the movie - the answering machine messages lost their humor and other lines fell flat. There also songs performed in scenerios that were just not in compliance with the original script. Specifically, one scene is of a reception in a country club and that just WOULD NOT happen.

Overall it was entertaining, but uninspiring in its adaption to the screen. But the message and heart and soul of RENT prevails and does come across.

I do agree with some other reviewers that though the performances were stellar, these characters are supposed to be struggling early twenty-somethings and it was obvious these were mid thirty-somethings which did make the characters appear desperate.

If you are a RENThead, go check it out, but don't expect to be dancing and singing when it's over.",1133136000,,2052,4.43236074270557
2717532,2,B000LXH0AY,"RENT the film works for exactly four minutes.  The opening credits role and then the cast sings 521,600 Minutes and its all downhill from there.  What follows a nice opening is a film so pointless, so banal, you'll asks as my wife did for the two and half hours back you spent watching RENT.

I remember when RENT opened on Broadway.  I remember I had a buddy who camped out on the street to see the play.  I remember people called RENTheads would record the shows in other cities and trade bad audio and video of the off Broadway productions starring Molly Ringwald and Doogie Howser. It was a phenomenon based on the tragic death of it's creator Jonathon Larson more than a well made show, and so the play stayed untouched, unfiddled around with, for who would dare touch the Genius of Larson?  Who would dare walk on his grave?

If I were the director of this movie I would have begged for a rewrite.  If ever there was a film dying for some heart, some central core, its RENT.  It's jumbled, it's messy, it contains characters that don't mesh, there's no coherence, no one worth rooting for, no one worth hating, and that's wrong. The passion and drive of the clunky play may work as live theater, heck CATS works as live theater, but RENT is charmless, pointless, and murky and it really shouldn't be.

RENT follows the exploits ""in the year of the life"" of Mark (Anthony Rapp) the angst ridden film maker, Roger (Adam Pascal) the Rockstar with AIDS, Mimi (Rosario Dawson) the heroin addicted Stripper with a heart of gold (and AIDS), Tom (Jesse L. Martin) the unemployed professor with AIDS, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) the Drag Queen (with AIDS)  who steals Tom's heart, Maureen (Idina Menzel) the performance artist and Mark's Ex-Girlfriend, and Joanne (Tracie Thomas) the Lawyer who falls in love with Maureen.  They are the bohemians, they can't pay the rent, they can't pay the heat, and everyday they stand the chance of being evicted.  So they sing.  They sing a lot, and at one point at a protest, they Moo.  That causes a near riot.  I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater.  But I had a feeling they were watching a different movie cause they kept clapping.

Why was this film so joyless?  Why were the main characters so whiney?  Why does RENT have no real heart?  The film just assumes that we the audience will like these people and so it makes no attempt to allow them to win our hearts.  It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends.  But half the film revolves around how these people don't get along. They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine.  They hate progress, they protest the idea of personal responsibility, and fight the man, for what? Nothing but a crappy apartment in New York City.

The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops.  The homeless women look at him and screams something like ""don't exploit me, get a job.""  These people are not happy, the lifestyle they promote is pointless and the film fails to take a stand on any of it.

The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level.  The dialogue clunks haphazardly into the songs.  The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater.  But you'll have 521,600 minutes attacking you in your dreams.  If the screenplay would have been retooled to fit the screen instead of the screen trying to replicate the stage a better movie would have emerged.  But RENT will appeal only to those who love the play.

The other glaring problem is the actors seem too old to embody these parts.  With actors culled from the original off-Broadway cast, it casts and even deeper gloom over the film.  We all have to grow up, this group of 30-somethings edge on pathetic.  A new cast of twenty-somethings would have worked a bit better.

So save your money.  You thank me I promise.",1133136000,,4084,4.5197817189631655
2717533,4,B000LXH0AY,"Rent as it exists as a Broadway show is a unique product of a specific time and specific place, and most importantly it plays to a certain audience because of its cast of 'starving artists' characters.  Rent as a film is difficult to capture, as the original show had a very sparse production design and the story was carried on the raw energy of the eprformers on stage.  Loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera ""La Boheme,"" Rent tells the story of Mark, a filmmaker looking to make the next great film, and his roommate Roger, who is trying damn hard to write the next great song.  Their landlord and ex-roommate Benny, who has recently become wealthy, is threatening to evict them if they don't pay a year's worth of back rent.  Benny offers to cut the pair a break if they help stop Maureen, Mark's ex, from putting on a demonstration protesting one of Benny's real estate developments.  Mark refuses, maybe partly because he was dumped for na girl, JoAnn.  In all the hubbub, the power in their building goes out, and Mimi, a stripper and drug addict who lives downstairs, comes up to get a light for her candle, and falls for Roger.  Add to the mix Tom Collins (no, I'm serious) and his new love, a drag queen named Angel, and you have the comnplete ensemble.  Of these, Tom, Angel, Mimi, and Roger have AIDS or are HIV positive.

On paper, this sounds a little hokey.  Keep in mind that the plot is still operatic, even if the music is rock/gospel/r&b.  The cast, most of whom were the original broadway company, are all committed, and all turn out great performances, both acting and singing.  Much of the 'sung lines' from the show have been made into dialogue, but I feel that this is necessary for a film adaptation of such a show.  Most convincing are the opening ""Seasons of Love"" and ""The Tango Maureen.""  Some elements ahve been cut, some have been added, all for great effect.  This is not an amazing movie, but I think that this is the best possible film version of a show that is best seen live.

2717534,5,B000LXH0AY,"My best friend and I have seen the play the first time it came to Minnesota back in 1997. We had since three times a year since. It has become our thing. I am even having some of the songs played during my wedding ceremony. So needless to say I have been in love with this production before I saw the movie.

 We went and saw it on opening night. Besides having teenage girls (I am only 24 I feel old) giggling and talking behind the whole movie. I enjoyed it. It did seem long at times; especially when you were waiting for them to sing they sang you know should go there. But I loved how Chris Columbus organized the movie having gone throughout the entire year. One thing was unlike seeing the play you couldn't sing a long without getting shhh! Today for me sung by Angel seemed a little dry, maybe because we were so used to dancing along. Viva La Boheme was really good a lot of energy. I guess the energy is what is expected in a movie. There will always be more energy at the play when you see them in person.

 It gave more depth to characters I have been following for eight years, which was nice. I knew I loved Jesse L. Martin in Law and Order, but that boy can sing and it just makes me like him more. Rosario Dawson filled the shoes of Mimi wonderfully. Even though I wasn't used to her voice listening to one Mimi on the soundtrack for eight years, but she did great. The other cast members were great too. I loved this movie. It has more talking, but it's a good tearjerker and fun movie to watch. I can't wait until it's out on video to dance to in the privacy of my own home. This is one movie either you love or you hate it.

Perhaps due to the brilliant casting of most of the original Broadway actors, RENT lived up to, and in some cases, surpassed it. I missed a lot of the omitted songs but I understand that it was decided to shave a few in lieu of dialogue which fleshed out the characters and story a bit more. But, Goodbye Love, Christmas Bells and Happy New Year were great songs that are sorely missed. Rosario and Tracie were were brilliant as newcomers, but Adam, Idina, Wilson, Jesse, Anthony and Taye brought the passion and fire to the roles they created with a magic that is seldom captured anywhere other than live theatre.

2717539,4,B000LXH0AY,"It wouldn't be fair to expect the film version of ""Rent"" to completely live up to the original Broadway show, but Chris Columbus' production does a pretty good job. This is a great example of a musical that has been successfully adapted to the big screen. However, there are definitely some kinks that prevent me from giving this movie five stars.

""Rent"" is a rock opera that was loosely based on Puccini's ""La Boh&egrave;me"" and also contains elements reminiscent of ""West Side Story."" The story revolves around an eclectic group of young people living in New York City that are coping with a world filled with corruption, anger, and disease. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne, the entire Broadway cast returned to star in the film version of the show, and that's what makes this movie so great. The performances are emotionally riveting and the music is absolutely phenomenal.

I don't understand why it took Hollywood almost ten years to turn ""Rent"" into a movie. Even though the cast is every bit as it was ten years ago, it's kind of weird to see that all of the characters are a decade older than they're supposed to be. The film feels kind of dated when you watch it: although Aids and homosexuality are still topics of discussion, they aren't the issues at the forefront of our lives anymore, and I hope that doesn't turn off people who are experiencing ""Rent"" for the first time.

There are a couple of nitpicky issues I have with the movie, and the first is the omission of the song ""Goodbye Love."" Ordinarily, I can completely understand that directors have to cut material for film adaptations, but I read an interview with Columbus in which he said that he chose to cut the song because he thought it was ""too emotional to deal with after Angel's death."" WHAT?! Talk about disrespecting someone else's artistic choices and completely belittling the mentality of your audience in the process! That was just ridiculous. Also, the film was supposed to be set in 1989, but I never would have picked up on that if the characters hadn't made reference to it a couple of times...everything looked like it was supposed to be set in the present day. The only other ""clue"" about the time period that Columbus threw into the film was a poorly-placed shot of the World Trade Center, which I thought was tasteless and kind of sloppy. There were also some very stupid camera shots in the film, such as that awful close-up of Adam Pascal when he's singing ""Your Eyes"" to his beloved Mimi...he looked so ridiculous that it completely ruined the moment. Also, there were some issues with poor character development in the film. That had nothing to do with the actors' performances: certain elements of the story just didn't transfer very well to the big screen. For example, poor Taye Diggs (who is a very good actor) had nothing to do during most of the film and just wandered around looking like a lost puppy dog. It was a real waste of some extraordinary talent. Oh well.

Overall, this is a very good movie. The cast is wonderful and the music is spectacular. The not-so-great things about the film are all Chris Columbus' fault, so maybe someone should tell him not to make any movies for a while.",1132963200,,3237,4.663747810858144

I wonder if some of the lukewarm reviews haven't influenced people's decisions to go to RENT.  Hope not, for I'm here to tell you, this movie is dynamite and IMHO much, much better than the play.  For one thing, in the movie you can hear every word, even with the increased rock instrumentation, for hundreds of sound experts have worked their magic and made sure that even people underwater could hear every single syllable; whereas on stage, it depended from night to night what percentage of the lyrics were going to be coming across the temperamental sound system of the Nederlander (NYC).

I did miss Daphne Rubin-Vega who was incomparably sexy and chilling as Mimi, but I never believed her being in love, and Rosario Dawson looked like she was just 'playing' at being bad and underneath she was ready to fall in love as soon as she saw Roger through the window.  Her scenes of addiction are captured in the movie effectively, in a rpaid montage that might disconcert some rentheads but will, I think, be easily understood by those new to the show.

Yes, some of the actors looked older than 20 somethings.  But we forget that most of those who died of AIDS in the 1989-90 period were actually in their 30s.  What's the big deal?  To me, Angel's fate is all the more sad because he seemed to be healthy for so long and then, all of a sudden, well, any more would bring me into spoiler territory.

Idina Menzel is not as over the top as she is on stage, but there's still plenty of fire power there, and she's bigger than anything in the movies since the heyday of Betty Hutton!  She looks remarkably beautiful and she doesn't miss a trick; and just when you think she'll overshadow Tracie Thoms as her attorney girlfriend, Joanne, the latter pulls off some memorable comic business and signals her disappointment and regret with her expressive brown eyes.  Anthony Rapp is charming as Mark Cohen, he comes off as a tiny terror, I wonder how tall he is, the constant scenes of him snarking down the streets with his fists clenched in anger at his sides, but no one else around to reveal his true proportions--the old Alan Ladd trick.  And Adam Pascal is suave and tormented in equal measures as Roger.  His eyelashes are so long I expected them to have a special spotlights in the credits, but no.

I have to disagree with the posters who claim that Larson wrote all the best numbers for the men in the cast.  Maybe that's personal pleading, but I find the best songs pretty much divided right down the middle.  Mimi's ""Out Tonight"" isn't as exciting as on stage, but it is much more compellingly staged, as Rosario Dawson steps out of the Cat Scratch Club after her shift only to launch into the second verse, and seems to scale the wall of the loft to get to Roger like Catwoman in the third.  (""I'll let you make me . . ."")  ""Light My Candle"" suffers a little without Daphne Rubin-Vega in it, and Adam Pascal acts as though he knows he's cheating on her with Rosario Dawson.  Afterwards he gets his balls back.  The ensemble singing of ""Will I?"" and ""Another Day"" are perfectly staged and rehearsed, and it's there that I started to lose it.  I guess I must have spent the last seventy minutes of the movie in a continual rain of tears.  By the end I had to sit through all the credits in a vain attempt to gather composure.  The faces of those whom I lost to AIDS flashed before my eyes.  Not all of them, but some of them.  I did resolve to go out and try to practice love on a grand scale.  They got me this time.  ""No other path, no other way, give in to love or live in fear.""

These sentiments are vapid and, in the daylight, seem a little silly, but the beauty and power of the movie is to convince you of their truth.  Good work all around.  I hope the movie's an enormous success.",1132963200,,4012,4.402985074626866
2717541,3,B000LXH0AY,"I saw ""Rent"" on Broadway in 1999. I remember thinking, somewhere into the second act, I'm loving this but there isn't a whole lot going on. ""Rent"" survives, -flourishes, on it's sweeping strokes of humanity; on it's bohemian urban ragamuffins singing the praises of life while suffering poverty, disease and drug addiction, like poor and junkie graduates from the school of ""Fame"". Big empty spaces in the musical, like a few bland characterizations, and sometimes tuneless songs, were overlooked due to the genuine portrait of unfortunate, but very much alive, lives in New York City's gutter level Alphabet City.

And for awhile it looked as though ""Rent"", the movie was going to accomplish the same fete. The first half moves at a lively pace, with beautiful people in ragged clothes, struggling for warmth in candlelit urban dwellings, songs pouring out of them as if it was a natural language, and colorful musical crowd scenes. The fiery and passive scene of a unified neighborhood, in chorus, taking a stand against slum lords, is a visual delight. Angel still makes her drop-dead sexy, snaky entrance, and I was about to be content to see ""Rent"" again realized, if not creatively reborn.

But somewhere along the way, the urban twilight-y atomosphere loses its spark. The thin story lines, which once served quite adequately as brush stroke generalizations of the urban poor, take center stage in lieu of the hardcore song of the city, rising up from the very bricks and mortar of Alphabet City. I thought the film was hurt very much by the absence of the schizophrenic bag lady, so evident in the Broadway production, pushing her shopping cart on stage and joining in on the cast's songs. She served as an anchor weight inclusion of unfortunate city dwellers, not all of whom are artistic bohemians. Here, she has a single dramatic scene that segregates her, as if depicting the real urban poor.

It was my understanding that Spike Lee was to be the director of the filmed, ""Rent"", and it would be interesting to see what another artist would have done. Director Chris Columbus extracts dynamic performances from the cast, notably Rosario Dawson, as a sympathetic and gorgeous heroin addicted AIDS victim, but he wastes precious time in many scenes, particularly the culture class gay wedding, that seems to wander in from a production of ""Hair"", and stays much too long.

It's been six years since I saw ""Rent"" on Broadway, and I still get offers from that theatre for reduced price tickets to a second viewing. I enjoyed ""Rent"", the movie, but I may finally take the theatre up on its offer, now that I'm reminded of what a great show it was.",1132963200,,2653,4.849889624724062
2717542,5,B000LXH0AY,"*SPOILERS!!!*

OK, i'm a fan of -La Boheme- who never experienced -Rent- before.  So i expected Mimi [Rosario Dawson, sparkling in her role as a heroin addict] to die in Roger's [Adam Pascal, also brilliant as the AIDS-infected songwriter who can't get a song together] arms.  & the very beginning, w/the actors all singing ""Seasons of Love"" on a bare, brilliantly-lit stage, prepares 1 to distance 1self.  Jonathan Larson may have re-created the operaetta as a semi-biographical paen to ""La Vie Boheme"" ... so i *expected* it to be *like* the operetta: sweet but not intimate.

What i wasn't expecting was the incandescent fire of the character of Angel  [Wilson Jermaine Heredia].  He's a show all by himself as the sassy drag queen who befriends Tom Collins [Jesse L. Martin, owner of a fine bass voice who generously gives Heredia screen space to shine], literally picking him out of the gutter where he'd been chased by thugs intent of robbery. It seemsthat every1 has AIDS in  this 90's tale ... AZT timers are the rage, & a support group [in which people slowly fade away] plays a major role.

Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, who's making a documentary about the eight friends, Idina Menzel as Maureen Johnson, the girl who tossed him aside for another woman [Tracie Thoms], & Taye Diggs as Benjamin Coffin III, who has betrayed his aristic friends by marrying into the wealthy family who owns the dilapidated building [where Mark & Roger & Mimi live] which they plan to demolish & build a  high-tech theatre -- all are competent, if no outstanding.  & it's a bit hard to believe these healthy 30-year olds are starving 20ish AIDS victims.

But it'd all worthwhile when Heredia steps onstage.  Even his tragic - but not unanticipated - death resonates, giving Martin a chance to shatter the screen w/his grief.  The other six react well as well, but Martin ... well, it hurts just to think about his sob-supressed reprise of ""I'll Cover You"", the song w/which Angel wooed him.  The ""525,600 minutes ... about the way that he lived/& the way that she died"" are about Angel ... & the movie underscores it by ending w/a picture of Angel as a him/her sexual enigma.",1132876800,,2164,4.733333333333333
2717543,1,B000LXH0AY,"The movie Rent is definitely a movie to see if your an adult. Its' mature theme limits the wide audience. It was well done from the stand point of having the original cast, 6 months pre-production, boldness, electricifying performances, and punts. On the other hand, the movie lacked a sense of wholeness. Almost like following through a music video without any script. Even when script was added to it, they used punts, funny but not necessary. This is a serious theme of AIDS and 1990's. I didn't even know that ATZ is a AIDS mediaction, until I thought about it. It was sort of vague, although, I did watch a film about aids and their incapable of paying rent. The end of the movie, made you wanted more... to complete the movie's message to take like everyday as today, not tomorrow. I think this rave on aids is more suited on broadway, not films.",1132876800,,852,4.538961038961039
2717544,3,B000LXH0AY,"""Rent"" is a thrilling, emotional experience on the stage: take it from someone who has seen the show on Broadway twice and in a primo road show version in Los Angeles starring Dougie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) three times.
But that was a number of years ago and though this Chris Columbus directed filmed version of ""Rent"" tries awfully hard to recapture the revolutionary feel of the new-to-Broadway-in-1994 subject matter (AIDS, drug addiction, etc.) and the re-writing and re-imagining of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" (by the super-talented Jonathan Larson)...it doesn't, though a couple of the scenes are knockouts: Mimi's (a dynamic, sultry, sexy Rosario Dawson) ""Out Tonight"" and the touching scene between Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) ""Light My Candle.""
Overall there is a nagging feeling of been there done that about this entire film though once again I must re-iterate: the songs are first rate at least and glorious at best plus all the performers do a bang-up job of singing, acting and dancing.
Unfortunately and frankly most of the performers are just too old for these parts: all of these actors were in the original Broadway production some 10 years ago. Remember this is a story about Gen X early twenty year olds and though they perform well: Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (Mark, Roger, Angel and Maureen) look like what they are, mid-thirty year olds. More importantly though, an essentially young person's concerns, problems and manner of looking at life juxtaposed onto someone who appears well into his or her 30's makes the characters pathetic and hopeless rather than tragic and hopeful and this friction irreparably damages the film to it's core.
Sadly then, ""Rent"" is a disappointment: a case of a show with excellent bones whose body begs, really needs to be updated to transform it into as smartly cast, cogent, with-it, and profound as it was 10+ years ago.",1132876800,,1919,5.037735849056604
2717545,3,B000LXH0AY,"I'm a huge fan of Rent; I think it's the best American musical ever made and it's up there with the best in the world. I was lucky to see the original production in New York, and I've seen many other excellent national stage productions. I've been waiting ten years for the movie. What I got was a Hollywood version that was hit and miss. It's another great musical, like Phantom of the Opera, that I regretfully won't be adding to my movie collection.

Let me say what I liked first. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi, all of the original cast was there, and Dawson was fine. Some of the scenes were fantastic: the opening street scene with fires burning everywhere and the cast singing the frenetic and galvanizing title song; Mark and Joanne's tango of despair; Angel and Collins singing Santa Fe on the subway; Maureen's Over the Moon performance was a riot; the Mad Hatter's dinner at the Life Cafe was suitably bohemian.

Now what I didn't like. Even with the occasional brilliance of certain scenes, the story and the characters had little chemistry or edginess; it pales in comparison to the stage show. The music is sung and played to perfection, but studio musicians have taken away its soul. Many of the segues between scenes and songs are terrible; some of them are just blackouts. Dialogue that sounds good sung sounds stilted unsung. Some major songs are missing. Other songs have been changed, for example, Mimi's signature song, Out Tonight, is performed in a strip club, reminding me of Flashdance, and there was no moondust in her hair! In Angel and Collins' love song, I'll Cover You, you can almost hear the director shouting for them not to get too affectionate with each other, perhaps to keep a PG-13 rating. Benny looked uncomfortable in his role, and you'd never know he was a bohemian at heart turned yuppie who eventually finds his way back. If one more person had laughed hysterically over Maureen turning lesbian, I swear I would have screamed. And almost acting as a coup de grace was the elaborate and farcical commitment ceremony between Joanne and Maureen which included their breakup song Take Me or Leave Me.

Please see this movie, especially if you've never seen the stage show. But if the movie doesn't thrill you, please note that the stage production is a whole lot better, and try to see it if at all possible. And if the movie does thrill you, then see the stage show anyway - you'll like it even better!",1132790400,,2457,4.65668202764977
2717546,5,B000LXH0AY,"I've had the privilege of seeing Rent on Broadway three

times with the original cast.  My family are Rent junkies.

We plan entire Christmas galas around the music of Rent.

We had high expectations and I'm very pleased to say

that we were not disappointed.  Chris Columbus did a very

good job at translating the musical to film.  Bringing

in all the original cast members with the exception of

Mimi is what made it work. Our old friends were back again.

And the new Mimi was wonderful. Even when the transition

2717547,5,B000LXH0AY,"As a diehard Rent fan, I must admit I was very skeptical of the big-screen adaptation.  Since my first viewing of Rent, I have adapted the lyrics as my personal mantras, listened to the soundtrack weekly, and fully submerged myself into the sheer beauty of Rent.

I am very thrilled to confirm, however, that the movie was nothing less then spectacular, and, dare I say, better than the play?  The liberties that Chris Columbus took were minimal enough to not affect the mood of the play, and also add to the clarity of the story for those who haven't deeply studied and analyzed every single action, song, line, etc. in the play.

Any viewer will be enthralled for the two-ish hours (and the time does fly by), and I myself was deeply sad it was over.  I was ready to buy another ticket as I walked out of the theatre and go see it again, and I certainly plan on going back to see it again.  This play was great for my friends who had seen it once, seen it multiple times, and for those who have never seen it before.

It was wonderful from the beginning of Seasons of Love to the end of Finale.  It was amazing.  That's all I can say.",1132790400,,1136,4.271028037383178

Very well directed. Best picture nomination should be considered for this gorgeous film.",1132790400,,408,4.527027027027027
2717549,5,B000LXH0AY,"Most recent movie remakes either were horrible (Dukes of Hazzard) or indescribably horrible (Bewitched). People responsible for those adaptations were so blinded by a chance of their picture making money that they consequently forgot to craft a product which actually WOULD make money.

Fortunately, Christopher Columbus remembered when adapting Jonathan Larsen's 1996 hit musical RENT. Chronicling `a year in the life' of New York bohemians, RENT has previously been described as my generation's HAIR.

This musical-film also deals with angst, love, tragedy, paired with lots of sociopolitical commentary. A group of artists' wrestles with AIDS, activism, personal addictions, and the politics of a former friend/roommate who wants to gentrify the area after he wed the landlord's daughter. He is now the elitist which he had once railed against---and the others are still fighting.

I was ecstatic when I found out that my favorite musical was being adapted by the movies; then grew skeptical about the potential product's quality. I am elated to confirm that RENT is not among the `motion picture adaptation' causalities. It should become a `textbook example' of how GREAT movie adaptations are made.

Most of the original (as in THE ORIGIAL) Broadway cast reprised roles for the movie. Because these actors had already invested so much time into the parts, they naturally wanted to do a good job on screen. I never got the impression they were calling in the lines, and therefore was genuinely sad when the movie ended----only because the picture was now over. I hadn't gotten that involved into a movie since I was a little kid.

I particularly liked Anthony Rapp (Mark)'s acting and think that the character whom I act the most like is Maureen (Idina Menzel), the angry young activist lover of Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms).

I (of course!) knew ALL of RENT's musical numbers by heart before going into the movie theater, but finally seeing it on-screen and generally unaltered was a delightful experience. Absence of the `message machine' breaks in this movie genuinely did not bother me. This screenplay did not attempt to add anything into the characters as `compensation' for theater modifications and therefore prevented its own candle from going out.

In another plus, it eschewed recent ""sitcom-Disneyfied"" portrayals of New York City to instead pointedly acknowledge cities as places where people are deal with life and death issues.",1132790400,,2449,5.248081841432225
2717550,5,B000LXH0AY,"Wow.  Having seen Rent 5 times, in three states and 2 different countries, I honestly didn't care if the movie was a religious follower of the play; I didn't care that some of the 'original' players were not along for the ride.  The stage version is my favorite musical of all time, and I've seen plenty of them.  Every time I've gone to see the show it's because I 'just want to see it one more time..' which inevitably leads to just one more, and just one more.

The movie is as magical as the show.  In a scant 2 hours and 15 minutes (the time flies by) the whole story is told.  Some of the details have changed, and die-hards have dissected those differences enough that I don't feel the need to recap them again here.  Suffice it to say, RENT captured a distinct time - the late 80's/early 90's and the AIDS epidemic at its most lethal - and the many different ways a group of friends dealt with the tragedy.  How amazing it is that even though AIDS is less of a death sentence today (at least in America) than it was at that time, the story is still as powerful and relevant as it was when Jonathan Larson wrote it back then.

If you truly loved the show, you won't nitpick the finer details of things that were changed; rather, you'll be grateful that it's been committed to film for good.  If you don't like musicals, you will likely not like this film.  But if you want to see a moving movie musical, it's hard to beat RENT.",1132704000,,1434,4.235294117647059

You will begin to get caught up in the story line from people that battle drug addictions, to love lost, to death, to friendship.  A must see for any movie fan who wants their money's worth!",1132704000,,474,4.340909090909091
2717552,5,B000LXH0AY,"""The Sound Of Music,"" while not my favorite Broadway show, is probably one of the best movie adaptations of a broadway musical...until now.  I admit, going into ""Rent"", I had high expectations and I was a little nervous.  However all of my expectations were surpassed by this incredible film.  That's right...this is a film in every aspect of the word.  The direction, cinematography, performances and script were all first rate.  Kudos to Mr. Columbus.  That's not to say that there aren't a few flaws, minor as they may be.  The film is set in 1989 and there is mention of the movie ""Thelma and Loiuse"" which had not been released yet.  Also, everything in the ""second act"" does seem kind of rushed, but the film being at 2 hours and fifteen minutes the audience does not feel cheated.  All in all this is a magnificent film, not just for musical theater geeks like myself, but also for anyone with a heart and the passion to dream and not let anyone take those dreams away.  Do yourself a favor this Christmas and pay your rent.",1132704000,,1031,4.554347826086956
2717553,3,B000LXH0AY,"If you have never seen Rent in any form, I urge you to see the play first.  The movie captures the spirit of Jonathan Larson but must dumb it down a lot to comply with FCC standards that gave them their PG13 rating.  Songs are lost (""Halloween,"" ""Contact,"" ""We're Okay,"" the end half of ""Good-bye Love"" (which, I might add, explains Mimi going to rehab) and most disappointingly ""Christmas Bells"") and others are turned into spoken word dialogue (""You Okay Honey,"" ""New Years Eve"").  In other songs, some of the characters are removed (such as Joanne in ""Rent"" and Angel in ""You'll See Boys"") in order not to confuse the audience.

The opening sequence of the film-from the cast standing on the stage at the Nederlander through the most expensive four minutes in a non-action film (the singing of ""Rent"")-sets the tone perfectly.  The quick cutting and loud rock edge introduces these characters the way the play does-with no holds barred as they toss flaming pieces of paper out the window.  The camera work is flawless here, as it is throughout the film, with high crane angles, sweeping jib motions, and the smooth pans of a steadicam.  It is perfect.

Unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't quite match that initial tone: suddenly ""New York"" became very colorful and bright-a bit too well-lit and jovial for a serious story about relationships and hard times falling on a group of friends.  While film was shot in 2:35 ratio to give the effect that you are still watching a stage performance (and thus you can see a great deal of the scenery around the characters), none of the subsequent scenes are as dark in texture or as high-energy (in terms of production value) as the opener.  They put everything into it and came out spent, taking a breather in ""You'll See Boys"" which pretty much holds two camera positions throughout the dialogue and song.  The pacing never found its flow: it jumped around and felt extremely rushed at the end as montage after montage was used to explain events that passed in the 525,600 minutes of these friends' lives.  For example, Mimi was only seen as a true addict throughout at the last few moments; up until then she just appeared like the majority of young New Yorkers in the art scene-a dabbler, an experimenter.

What was the most upsetting to me, though, was how the play was an ensemble cast, with Mark as a narrator throughout.  The film tried to duplicate that but fell short: by cutting solo songs for Joanne and Angel, they became secondary characters.  The balance was never retrieved.  I'm not quite sure what Christopher Columbus actually did with this film: the cast didn't need much coaching, as the majority of them originated in these roles, and those the characters were already theirs.  Each and every one of them gave an impeccable performance.  Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography (as always) was complex and beautiful and added to the vibrant world, especially in ""Life Support,"" when the camera took a 360 around the circle, always over the shoulder of one member to another and never once losing focus.  Only once did it distract from the moment: when Mimi has just come back from nearly ODing she and Roger are sharing a moment, and they are in the far left corner of the screen, leaving an evenly spaced Maureen and Joanne to fill the middle and right side of the screen, and leaving the eye to naturally be drawn to them, even though it is a clear moment for Mimi.  However, the fact that I can't find Chris Columbus in this film is not, by any means, a negative comment: he is no auteur, and if he tried to make too great a mark, he would have ruined the film.

Don't get me wrong, though: just because I am being critical does not mean I did not enjoy my time in the theatre.  I saw the film at 12:01 AM on November 23rd-the very first showing on the west coast, and I was surrounded by other true Rent fans.  We cheered, we clapped, we sang along, and we mooed with Maureen (as we should have).  I am perhaps overly critical of this film not just because I work in this industry but also because I had such high expectations for the film-being such a diehard fan (I saw the play on Broadway six times before I moved out of New York and once in LA since).  Jesse L Martin was especially endearing: he took Tom Collins to a new level and clearly had a lot of fun doing it.  The high moments of the film (other than the performances) were the almost ""Chicago's"" Roxanne moment in ""Tango Maureen,"" ""La Vie Boheme,"" (even though they took out parts of it) ""Take Me Or Leave Me,"" and ""Without Me.""

Rent will make you laugh, make you cry, and most importantly, make you feel for and relate to its main characters.  To some the subject matter is still controversial, but at the core is the most endearing and heartwarming story about true friends that I have ever seen.  Rent is a great film, but an incomparable play.  They should set up a three-camera shoot at the Nederlander and put that on DVD.",1132704000,,4965,4.564825253664036
