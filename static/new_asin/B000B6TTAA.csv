8082638,5,B000B6TTAA,"This is a great, fun, informative series presented in a hilarious and utterly appropriate way!  The only thing I have to say is where is the rest of the series?  Why only release a few episodes?  At roughly 20 minutes each, it couldn't have been much extra work to include the entire season, and I certainly found myself wanted to see more when I was finished with the included episodes.  Great series by the History Channel.  Don't miss the DVD Mail Call S.N.A.F.U. to catch all the bloopers!",1187827200,2,493,4.556818181818182
