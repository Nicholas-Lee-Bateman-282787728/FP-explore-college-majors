2397292,5,B000AYEIEK,"Unlike the other reveiwer here, I kinda thought the title on the DVD gave it away...""London's smash hit West End Show"" This IS the closest anyone these days can get to seeing the Rat Pack. It's a great show and Stephen Triffit is as close to sinatra as can be. Mark Adams plays Deano very Well and Gills is a very good Sammy.

The Berrelli sisters are beautiful. The show gives an inkling of what is was like to be in the company of these 3 great entertainers. Luckily I have managed to see the show live and the DVD is a great representation and a fabulous show.",1139270400,16,563,4.212962962962963
2397293,1,B000AYEIEK,"There's no Frank Sinatra in this DVD - neither is there any Dean Martin or Sammy Davis Jr.

And nobody tells you this! Until you purchase it, play the disk - and find it out for yourself, in the most unpleasant manner!

I sincerely don't know who the HECK had the dumb idea of substituting those great singers. But not telling that straight up doesn't help at all!",1137715200,22,364,4.338235294117647
2397304,5,B000AYEIEK,"This is a great musical tribute to one of the greatest musical acts in history.  This is a live taping from Las Vegas of a Broadway Musical Tribute show that attempts to recreate the famous Sands Hotel performances by Frank, Dean, and Sammy.  It is full of a lot of great music and the performers do a wonderful job of portraying the performance style and antics of Frank, Dean, and Sammy.

To the person who gave this a 1 star rating for it not actually starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, or Sammy Davis Jr., I'm sorry that you were so disappointed by them not appearing in their own musical tribute show honoring the deceased singers.",1371427200,,638,4.530434782608696
2397305,5,B000AYEIEK,"Truly great show of the 3 Kings of 20th century entertainment. Cracking band, genuinely funny humor and those timeless Ring a Ding tunes. Buy it.",1343865600,,145,4.84
2397306,4,B000AYEIEK,"I was born too late to catch ""The Chairman of the Board"" and the Rat Pack in Las Vegas.  This year I was in Las Vegas, but the friends I was with didn't want to see a show similar to this.  So, I thought I'd spend the money I saved on the live show and buy this DVD.

Let me say, Stephen, the guy who plays Frank, is about as close to Frank Sinatra as you are ever going to get.  When he first appears, I thought he looks pretty close to Sinatra.  He doesn't sound exactly like Sinatra, but he's 98% there.  By the end of the DVD, I was very impressed with his capturing the way Sinatra moved, his mannerisms, the way he carried himself, etc.  In short, he's damn good!

The man that played Dino - well, he would never pass for Dean's twin physically, but he's a very good performer and singer - top notch.  I really don't know Sammy Davis Jr. that well to comment on that actor's performance.  I don't think he looked too much like Sammy, but I did enjoy his performances of ""Mr. Bojangles"" and ""Candyman"" as a bonus feature.

The Borelli sister were beautiful, and added to the 60's feel of the show.

My only real criticism is they have these strange noisy video cutaways during the show of the girls and the performers supposedly ""partying after the show in their hotel room at The Sands"" I guess.  It wasn't a deal breaker, but it just didn't work for me.

Overall, this is about as close as it's ever going to get to seeing the Rat Pack Live in Las Vegas.",1335830400,2,1461,4.171428571428572
2397307,5,B000AYEIEK,"Well worth the money to have this. I saw this show live about 3 years ago and it was wonderful. While I believe the performer playing Sammy that I saw onstage is miles ahead, Gilz Terera is no slouch and Mark Adams captures Deano's perfect comic timing and crooning artistry. I love having the ability to put in the DVD and enjoy an evening with ""the guys"" whenever I want and Stephen Triffitt is an amazing Sinatra! It almost requires more belief to know it isn't the chairman there himself. You won't regret this purchase.",1326499200,,524,4.526315789473684
2397308,5,B000AYEIEK,This was a gift for my husband. While he sits at his computer I hear him roaring with laughter and I know he's watching his Rat Pack dvd.  Thanks.,1325030400,,146,4.0344827586206895
2397309,5,B000AYEIEK,"I give this 5 stars because its a fun show. The true Rat Pack afficionados will need to be open minded as these guys aren't perfect impersonaters.  I do think however, they give a very fine and enjoyable performance and replicate what an evening with The Rat Pack was like back in the 60's. So even though they are not perfect, I can't imagine three guys doing a much better job overall. As you will see, assuming you buy this, this is pretty big production. Dare I say, bigger than ""THEY"" used to do..., minus of course the big named talent. They do their acts individually, paired off and as a group. They unauthentically start, to be nit-pickey, the show with ""Frank Sinatra"". Having watched this DVD a couple times now, I now think it makes the most sense. He's the the big-gun, the most beleivable. The Frank is the best of the three, followed by Dino and then Sammy. The Frank does just about everything as good as you could want including his looks. The Dean Martin has the mannerisms down, the voice is generally pretty good and I would imagine, from afar in a theater, he probably looks the part. We watch it up close on a 72"" sceen so nothing escapes us... The Sammy could be better. Those are tough shoes to fill! I've always thought Sammy truely was(is still) the greatest entertainer of all time. The Sammy in this show does an acceptable job and like I say, if I were in the audiance, several rows back, I'm sure he would be more believable. Hey, somebody had to come in third...Having said all that, this is a great show overall. Even if you are a true afficionado, they should all grow on you...and at times you might even forget about some of the initial misgivings. All three of these guys have big shoes to fill. We rented it a year ago and now have bought it. Glad we did. As a bonus, there are some female singers that help round out the show...If you have ever seen the DVD, Rat Pack Live and Swing'in or listen to any of the Rat Pack CD's, or there individual live shows - The Sands, etc..., you will recognize some of the familiar ol' tea-time shtick and the other so-called not politically correct jokes used in this DVD - all which are very fitting and help make this performance more ""believable"". It is longer than any of the real Rat Pack shows - at least that I recall. I wish those guys would have filmed more back then...This is a decent substitute if you're willing to be open-minded. Perhaps having your very own ""tea-time"" whilst watching this DVD wouldn't hurt either Pally...Ain't nothing wrong wit that!",1287532800,7,2541,4.452789699570816
