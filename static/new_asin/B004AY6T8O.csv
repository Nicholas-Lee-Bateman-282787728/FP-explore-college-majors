4312609,4,B004AY6T8O,"This is a good video, actually pretty hard for a beginner video.  You will definitely feel the effects in your thighs!",1359158400,5,118,4.619047619047619
4312610,5,B004AY6T8O,"I really like this workout.  I started working out at home recently, and I love the fact that you cover a lot of muscles in 35 minutes.  I didn't realize that such tiny movements could really impact my abs.  The pace was pretty brisk, and the instructor explained the moves well.  I felt motivated during the entire workout because of the background music and the instructor's guidance.  I had to stop a couple of times on the thigh work because my legs started to shake.  I recommend giving this a try if you like a barre workout.  I bought the dvd's on the Bar Method's website because the prices on Amazon were really high.",1355961600,4,626,4.43859649122807
4312611,3,B004AY6T8O,"Decent workout on DVD, but very expensive compared to other similar Pilates, etc. DVDs, which offer multiple workouts for different levels and target areas on one DVD.  On 'The Bar Method' web.site, DVDs are $17 and $20,. then charge nearly that much to ship - so they equate to amazon price all-in.",1348099200,4,299,4.75
4312612,5,B004AY6T8O,"Great for toning, strengthing, and reshaping your body. This is quick, effective workout, that is challenging, but not difficult, and a lot more fun than the gym! You get tone, lean, elongated muscles, not bulky.

But buy the DVDs from The Barre Method website ( [...] ).
They are $17 -$20 each instead of the nearly $70 each Amazon is charging.

Update -
Cannot believe Amazon deleted the link...so wrong! But as you know, simply type bar method without spaces and add .com to the end, then click the dvd link on the homepage.  or c/p:  bar method .com/ dvds/ exercise-dvds. html  into url bar and remove spaces.",1344902400,24,613,4.638888888888889
4312613,5,B004AY6T8O,"This is a great 35 minute workout that targets arms, legs, butt/seat, and abs. It is do-able on the first attempt, even if you're not in great shape to begin with. I bought this DVD at the local Bar Method studio and I'm glad I did because I think it's a great way to get started on the method and get stronger before attending the classes. Plus, once you're taking the classes, I think this DVD is a great way to do a workout on days you can't make it to the studio. It's nothing ""fancy"" but you will definitely feel the burn!",1341360000,6,527,4.12621359223301
4312614,4,B004AY6T8O,"This was my first barre workout, though I've been wanting to try it for some time. I've done similar routines like Callanetics and Core Fusion Body Sculpt, and I have to say I think this is my favorite. The other ones are great in their own right, but I find myself struggling to keep motivated with them. The best part of this Bar Method routine, in my opinion, is the pace. It moves so quickly that I don't have time to think about how much I don't want to be holding that position for so long or dread how much longer there is on the DVD. Additionally, I've never seen an instructor explain the positions so clearly. He moves along at a clip and tells you exactly how to position yourself and reminds you at all the times you need reminding. That said, his manner is extremely brusque, and once I get the hang of the routine, I expect I'll be muting it and listening to music. I very much want to do this routine 3-5 times a week (my arms are absolutely seared from yesterday) but I don't think I can put up with his manner that often. Nonetheless, it's not enough for me to put it away--just something to be aware of and prepared for. Also, the DVD was much cheaper at Burr Leonard's website: I bought two of them there. I'm so excited to have found The Bar Method.",1340582400,18,1269,4.24793388429752
4312615,5,B004AY6T8O,"This beginner's workout packs a pretty good wallop! If you focus on form and really give the moves your all, you will get an excellent barre routine to strengthen your total body in only 35 minutes. And since it doesn't completely overload your muscles you can do it nearly every day if you choose. A good one to hang onto, especially for those time-crunched days.

Oh and buy it from their own website for half the price.",1298937600,41,422,4.48051948051948
4312616,5,B004AY6T8O,"This is a quick but effective workout - targets all the muscles in about 30 minutes.  Clear, timely instructions and an engaging instructor.  I've been taking the hour long classes a few times a week and this is a great supplement (it gives my muscles a break and a workout at the same time if that makes sense, as the hour long classes are really intense).  You can buy it directly from the bar method web site for $20.",1296777600,16,420,4.291139240506329
4312617,5,B004AY6T8O,my massage therapist recommended this to me to strengthen my butt and lower back since i sit all day for my job. my legs were shaking half way through the video. my only suggestion is to order it straight from the companies website since you can buy it there for $20...,1293235200,88,269,4.294117647058823
4312618,5,B004AY6T8O,"I love this workout.  It is nonimpact and only 35 minutes from start to finish.  There is no excuse not to be doing it.  My only regret is that I did not discover this workout while living in LA.  I would have been down the street every day to take Joey's class is Burbank.  If you are new to exercise, need low to nonimpact, this workout is perfect.  Joey packs alot of punch in such a short workout and no muscle is left out.  If you are intermediate to advance, you may get bored or not feel it is challenging enough, but for the rest of us who may be new, had surgery or trying to get back into shape after a long hiatus, this is PERFECT!  Thanks Joey and Burr!",1290729600,42,665,4.022900763358779
4312619,5,B004AY6T8O,"This was great! I read a few reviews that said the instructor (Joseph) was snooty or brusque but I found him funny and helpful. (He's very much a ""prima donna"" but I found him amusing.) I sit all day at my job, and this has really helped my circulation and lessened my leg cramps at night. They remind you about your positioning just at the point where you're likely to slack off. The workout itself is about 37 minutes. I wore my Body Bugg during the work out this a.m. and it said I burned 99 calories. Not bad for a ZERO impact workout. The only thing I might have liked better is a little more instruction or options with regard to the modifications. I have a really bad wrist (amongst other joints thanks to rheumatoid arthritis) and one or two of the moves is difficult to impossible for me to do. They do show a gal in the back row doing a modification but I had already gone through the workout 3 times before I noticed it. Otherwise, I feel it was a great work out. I was amazed at how much I was sweating when I was done and all that without hurting my achy joints.",1409702400,,1075,4.173076923076923
4312620,5,B004AY6T8O,I have taken the class in person but the time it not good for me so I bought this DVD to try and I just love it.  You get the same intensity as the class with the same results!  I really love it!,1404086400,,195,3.511627906976744
4312621,5,B004AY6T8O,"Really enjoying this DVD.  It looks like these exercises should be easy but they are definitely not.  It's definitely challenging!  I had no experience with Bar Method and after just a few times through the DVD I'm able to follow along really well.  The instruction provided is really good, though I would prefer a different instructor.  I really appreciate that the DVD guides you through finding everyday things in your home to do the exercises, instead of encouraging you to purchase their branded equipment.  Once I get the hang of this DVD, I'll likely buy another in the Burr Leonard series.",1401148800,2,597,4.861386138613861
4312622,5,B004AY6T8O,"I love that this is a ""short, intense"" workout.  So many reviewers have said that this is an easy dvd to do.  Well, I consider myself to be in fairly good shape, danced, did ballet for years, runner, etc. and this is NOT an easy workout.
Just look at Joey, the master instructor, in the dvd.  He's sweating, and his legs are shaking, right along with mine, in the video!
This shouldn't deter you though.  I can't do all the reps, but I just rest, then get at it again. My stomach muscles could feel it the next day, after my first attempt, and my arms were quite sore, in a good ""what a workout!"" way!
I alternate this dvd with the New York City ballet dvd, and it is a great way to exercise, as far as Im concerned.
I also like the instructor's upbeat, and encouraging attitude. He keeps me focused.
Great intro to the Bar method.
Highly recommended!",1371513600,5,851,4.267080745341615
4312623,1,B004AY6T8O,"I was hoping this and the other Bar Method Workout DVD were more in the lines of beginning ballet classes. It is not. Not only is it boring, it is nothing the title refers to. When I think of bar moments and workouts I think of ballet. This is a joke. I don't care if this is part of a franchise of studios across the country. It is not not ballet. Its just a standard workout video. No wonder in small print on each of the different DVD's it says no bar (Ballet bar is needed). The DVD's are over priced as well.",1370044800,4,513,3.9902912621359223
4312624,1,B004AY6T8O,"I found the (only) workout on this video to include very few new exercises.
The bar work was three exercises (basic toe lifts with feet in three positions).
Can't believe that is supposed to be some special bar method.

The rest of the workout included tricep, bicep, abs, pushups etc sometimes
using dumbbells. No new or interesting exercises, no real bar workout
Very disappointed to have spent $25 on this.",1365552000,8,409,4.8428571428571425
4312625,1,B004AY6T8O,They sell it btw $17-20 on their websites (author bar website) and you can buy collection for less. some have exercise accessories you need. Much better deal. It's rip off here!,1363132800,7,177,4.741935483870968
4312626,5,B004AY6T8O,"Never one to exercise, but now I look forward to staying in shape.  My co-workers have noticed the changes and I feel great both phyically and mentally!",1362614400,5,152,4.62962962962963
4312627,5,B004AY6T8O,"First thing first, don't buy this on Amazon unless it has come down to $20.  I don't know why it's so expensive on Amazon.  Go to The Bar Method website and purchase it there for about $20. Now for the workout review.....

IT IS AWESOME!!!!! I love this workout because its a beginner workout that almost everyone can do. You get a great workout in minutes and it will introduce you to what The Bar Method is all about.  I bought it because I wanted to get a little experience and strength under my belt before I went to an actual Bar Method studio. It was good to start out with but an actual Bar Method class is much more intense and longer.  However, you get some great basic skills and routine with this DVD.  After doing an actual studio class, I still love this DVD.  Plus it's much cheaper than going to an actual class.

What I also love about The Bar Method in general is that I never have back issues.  I have to be really careful in workouts because its easy to injure my back.  The Bar Method and Yoga are the only two things that do not hurt my back.  In fact they make it feel so much better.  The Bar Method literally puts my body into an exhaustion that feels similar to a boot-camp workout or a long run except in Bar, you barely move your body.  It's great for people who have bad joints.",1362355200,16,1306,4.176
4312628,5,B004AY6T8O,"I've been searching high and low for the perfect home workout.  It's so hard for me to stay motivated when working out at home...so in my incessant search for workout and body sculpting DVDs I stumbled upon The Bar Method.

Wow, oh wow!!

I was intrigued from reading the first review.  I bought the DVD (from Bar Method, not Amazon!) and LOVED it.  I was burning and shaking less than 1/2 through the DVD.  I loved it so much that I located my local Bar Method and started taking classes!  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!

I still use the DVD at home 2x a week and I go to the class 2x a week.  I can tell the difference already.  Total convert!  I can't wait til I'm strong enough to move up to the next DVD.  I think I should be ready in about two more weeks since I'm working out 4x a week now.

And, as the others have mentioned, don't buy this from Amazon!  It's more than 3x higher than the corporate price.",1361318400,9,916,4.219653179190751
8421180,5,B004AY6T8O,"Good, simple workout.  Easy to fit in at home around busy schedule and is still a good muscle building workout.",1486512000,,111,4.55
8421181,5,B004AY6T8O,"I love the Bar Method DVDs. Burr gives excellent instructions and you can go at your own pace and yell at her when you're dying and she always keeps a nice, sweet tone.",1483574400,,168,4.121212121212121
8421182,5,B004AY6T8O,I am very happy doing this workout at home on my schedule,1478908800,,57,3.8333333333333335
8421183,5,B004AY6T8O,Not as strenuous as some of the series but still had my arms and legs shaking. Short workout. About half an hour.,1474416000,,113,4.181818181818182
8421184,5,B004AY6T8O,"A tough workout. The word ""Beginners"" led me to believe it would be slightly less challenging than it actually proved to be.",1473984000,,124,4.681818181818182
8421185,5,B004AY6T8O,Great workout,1456790400,,13,6.0
8421186,5,B004AY6T8O,Love this workout. Great for a beginner. Joey the instructor is excellent & explains things very well. I wish he had other DVDs as well for moderate & advanced levels.,1449273600,2,167,4.6
8421187,4,B004AY6T8O,"I absolutely love this workout.  However, I could only give it four stars because the fast pace of this DVD has reduced the time for the stretches.  I don't feel like I am getting enough of a stretch for my muscles.  I also purchased the Bar Method Change Your Body, and I like that DVD much better.  The pace is slower and the stretches are longer.  This beginner workout is still great for those days when I don't have an hour to dedicate to my workout.  I also cannot stand the instructor's voice in this beginner DVD.  When I am working to the ""burn"" on a muscle and I hear him rambling on, it really gets to me.  I have actually caught myself yelling at him to pleast shut up.  LOL.  I am hoping to get to the point where I can complete the workout with the sound off and just follow the visual cues.  As many other reviewers, I purchased my copy on the Bar Method website.",1431648000,,878,4.166666666666667
8421188,4,B004AY6T8O,I have taken a few classes and decided I would try this DVD based on the reviews. It is surprisingly effective.,1428278400,,111,4.333333333333333
8421189,3,B004AY6T8O,Moves a bit too fast for the BEGINNER workout. Other dvd's led by Burr are much more user friendly.,1426636800,,99,4.2631578947368425
