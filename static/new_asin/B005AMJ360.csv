8463395,5,B005AMJ360,"There is no romanticizing the West here. At the end of the day only grim realities remain through fleeting memories of what may have been happier times. Yet, looking back, there seems to be a bit of sentimentality for the romance of the West or better yet, sentimentality for that loss of romance of what was once the West.

Michael Winner's LAWMAN is an interesting western capturing the end of an era with sentimentality of sorts combined with a brutal cathartic streak of graphic violence. If the legends die, they certainly end here with director Michael Winner's vision of one era ending and a new one beginning. This one of Burt Lancaster's best performances and is an almost symbolic operatic parable that parallels his own career as a major film star whose time in the spotlight was slowly coming to an close. This is a film that bears repeated viewing. Its multi-layered structure is very stark yet haunting and the final confrontation in the street leaves the viewer mesmerized. This is very much-overlooked classic from director Michael Winner.

An often overlooked film is 1967's HOUR OF THE GUN directed by John Sturges, which is a direct sequel to his 1957 film GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL. HOUR OF THE GUN begins with the gunfight, which was the protracted climax to the 1957 film. In the 1967 film the gunfight is short, concise and a thoroughly bitter affair. From that point on we see James Garner's Wyatt Earp begin a transition from a highly moral individual who upholds the law to a man who gradually turns into a dark and unattractive character who uses the law to seek revenge with growing ferocity as he falls deeper into an abyss of moral decline with each act of vengeance. In a total role reversal we also see Jason Robards' Doc Holliday questioning Earp's motives as he acts as his ever present conscience throughout. When Earp's vengeance is finally complete we see him return or attempt to return to the man he once was. However, the friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday is no longer what it was. Doc Holliday was a man who had fallen from grace long before he befriended Wyatt and to watch his friend go down that same path obsessed and devoid of conscience was too much for him to bear. Doc Holliday had befriended the upstanding Wyatt out of some sense of self-redemption. By the end of HOUR OF THE GUN that notion is destroyed. James Garner's performance as Wyatt Earp is one of his best. His moral decline and final realization of his vengeful acts come full circle as you visually examine his performance. Edward Anhalt's script and John Sturges' direction are a powerful combination. There is quite a bit of moral ambiguity at play in HOUR OF THE GUN.",1419638400,4,2698,4.701902748414376
