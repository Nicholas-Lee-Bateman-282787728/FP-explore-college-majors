5090838,4,B007J7I5UO,"Without a doubt, one of the best expose's of the Watergate account and President Nixon's fall. This movie is more closely aligned with Woodward and Bernstein's report than with Olver Stone's account; however, that film was good also. Lane Smith is excellent as President Nixon, probably more so than that of Anthony Hopkin's portrayal. Both actors however give the viewer a sympathetic attitude toward this disgraced president. What President Nixon allowed to go on was not right, but after viewing this movie, you can't go away without some feeling of empathy for the man. I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD-it has! Very well worth the price.",1301616000,2,662,4.919642857142857

5090840,5,B007J7I5UO,"America has had tragedy upon tragedy to go along with all the triumphs, but few tragedies have ever had as much ink and visual space and time devoted to them as the downfall of the administration of President Richard Nixon due to the Watergate scandal.  The 1989 made-for-TV movie THE FINAL DAYS goes inside this uniquely American tragedy as it happened, from the June 17, 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committe in the Watergate building to the moment on August 9, 1974 when Nixon called it quits.

Based on the book of the same name by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, this basically serves as a continuation of the great 1976 film ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN by taking a look at the situation facing the tragically flawed Nixon (Lane Smith, in a very accurate portrayal) and his administration as the result of the break-in, the secret Oval Office tape recordings that Nixon never wanted to ever see the light of day, and the unconscious paranoia that eventually destroyed him, and did significant damage to his place in history.  Richard Pearce's fine direction and screenwriter Hugh Whitmore's pointed adaptation of the Woodward/Bernstein book are aided tremendously by some great ensemble acting, including Theodore Bikel as Henry Kissinger; Gary Sinise (of ""CSI: New York"") as Watergate investigator Richard Ben-Veniste; and Richard Kiley as J. Fred Buzhardt, one of Nixon's many lawyers.

The end result with THE FINAL DAYS is a truly sobering look at how power can corrupt, and absolute power can corrupt absolutely, and, in Nixon's case, with cataclysmic force.  Much like Oliver Stone's later NIXON, minus that film's ""conspiracies"", this is a film to be appreciated for both its message, its acting, and its storyline, which remains as timely today as it was when it aired in 1989, and when the real events themselves were unfolding before us.",1142121600,8,1861,5.009708737864078
5090841,5,B007J7I5UO,"If you saw All The President's Men (1976), I highly recommend The Final Days (1989-TVM) based upon the book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.  Lane Smith is excellent as the President of the United States, Richard Nixon.  The film deals with the aftermath of the Democratic National Committee Headquarters break-in in the Watergate building, but mostly the secret tapes of conversations that Nixon wanted covered-up from the court and the public, and what eventually led to Richard Nixon resigning, the first president to ever do so.  (Spiro Agnew resigned as Vice-President the year before).  They made this tv-movie while Richard Nixon was still alive and retired.  Patricia Nixon passed away June 22, 1993.  Richard Nixon visibly broke down at the funeral and it was televised nationwide.  All the surviving Presidents and First ladies attended.  Richard Nixon died less than a year later on April 22, 1994.  He was buried next to his wife at the Richard Nixon Library and just steps away from the house he was born in.
  It is intersting that his birthplace and  his place of burial are just footsteps near each other.",1065225600,11,1124,4.951871657754011
8518236,5,B007J7I5UO,"This is an excellent filming of the Bernstein / Woodward book (true or not) with Lane Smith quite often sounding and looking like President Nixon without doing a forced ""impersonation"". The visual quality and sound are both excellent. If this was made from a pirate tape copy it doesn't look it. Grab it while you can.",1529625600,,318,4.696428571428571

8518242,3,B007J7I5UO,"Lane Smith is a fine actor but doesn't come off strong as Nixon!! check out Rip Torn as Nixon in ""Blind Ambition""! Best Nixon of all!",1411862400,,133,4.153846153846154
8518243,5,B007J7I5UO,"Lane Smith was one of my favourite actors even if he was underrated.
This movie was required for me to see having been a massive fan of his.
I love the fact that there are special features on this which was also one of the reasons I bought it also.
Lane Smith should have won a Golden Globe for his performance in this and it was a shame he didn't, but I think he would have been pleased some of his work got recognised.
Often when you think of a TV movie you tend of think now days that TV movies are not very good but some do surprise us like this movie how well put together it is and like another of Lane Smith's TV movies Dark Night Of The Scarecrow is another one.
I didn't know much about Richard Nixon as I am not from America, but this movie certainly helps with an insight of what it was like for him and the things he did.",1374278400,,833,3.9642857142857144
8518244,3,B007J7I5UO,"I chose this rating for one reason. The seller warns that the buyer be sure what regions this can be played within. This was labeled ""Universal"". However I was unable to play it on any of my DVD players...with one exception. I have the Phillips universal player and it worked. I assumed that if the DVD is marked Universal that it would play universally on any DVD. But perhaps the Universal tag means just that...One must have a DVD player rated as Universal as well. Otherwise, the product worked well. This drama was quite moving. Lane Smith was exceptional. Well worth the the price and the mix-up.",1372118400,,602,4.635514018691588

It is an accurate depiction of a most interesting time in American political history.

I greatly recommend this movie.",1327449600,,200,4.714285714285714
