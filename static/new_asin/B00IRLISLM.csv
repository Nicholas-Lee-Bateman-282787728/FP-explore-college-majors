6289815,5,B00IRLISLM,"While I watch a lot of faith based films, I usually do so with pretty low expectations.  Many are pretty cheesy and low budget.  This film is definitely not cheesy or low budget at all.  I loved Rich and his work, and saw him many times in concert, but I have a whole new appreciation of his work after seeing this film.  I'm so glad they didn't whitewash his struggles, because it's those struggles that give context to so much of his work.  Many faith based films really aren't great to share with unbelievers as they tend to be a little unrealistic and pat.  This film I will be sharing with my non believing friends, as it shows God is up to the struggles of real life, and continues to love us through them as we fight.  This movie will join ""Blue like Jazz"" on my shelf as one of my favorite faith based films.",1400025600,6,816,4.225806451612903
6289816,5,B00IRLISLM,"Disclaimer: Rich Mullins, the subject of the movie Ragamuffin was my best friend, brother and companion for 2 decades. My character, the short mouthy blonde is accurately portrayed in the beginning of the movie. (smile)
That said, I think if you are interested in a review of a bio pic, you just might be interested in the opinion of someone who actually knew the man.
Rich Mullins was a successful Contemporary Christian musician, probably best remembered as the writer/singer of the worship anthem Awesome God. He was known as the quirky, beloved poet of his industry, coming to concerts barefoot and giving away much of his considerable wealth to the poor. David Leo Schultz and his crew from Color Green Films could have made an endearing little movie where all is well and the hero is shiny and perfect in the current fashion of the genre of faith based films.
But Rich wasn't perfect and it was his imperfection that drew Schultz to produce an authentic movie about a broken man who authentically loved God.
Ragamuffin portrays the story of Rich from his young life on a farm in rural Indiana to his death in a car accident in September of 1997. While music and the struggles of fame are major ingredients in the story, the universal storyline for me is the unresolved relationship between Rich and his father, John. (Truly, can you name 10 people in your life who do not have strained relationships with their fathers, either deceased or alive? Maybe 5?) This is the heart of the story-what people do when they believe in their hearts that they are not enough.
Enter the true hero of the story, author and speaker, Brennan Manning. Brennan, an ex-priest, divorced alcoholic in recovery (sometimes) is able to model for Rich the truth of being a ragamuffin, people who know that they are wounded, broken, and messy, yet know that God loves them, just as you are and not as you should be, for none of us are as we should be.
This is a movie about pain, brokenness and redemption. It is not preachy or religious in the overly pious sense of the word. It is certainly not your mamas Christian movie, but it is powerfully done, providing authentic hope for us ragamuffins of the world.",1400025600,497,2187,4.668393782383419
6289817,5,B00IRLISLM,"This is, very simply, one of the finest movies about faith, grace, and forgiveness that I have ever seen. Rich was a man of faith, a man who struggled openly and honestly with his brokenness and who lived and spoke powerfully about the mercy and tenderness of God. The move has impacted me, as well as many of my friends. I'm a Christian mental health counselor, and have begun using it in small groups within my practice. The film itself changes lives, and the discussions it prompts leads folks to even greater change. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say, ""When I watched that, I saw me, and I saw God much more clearly. I could not recommend Ragamuffin more highly.",1400025600,79,686,4.496
6289818,3,B00IRLISLM,"Not a bad movie overall, but the movie did not project the whimsical Rich as seen in the delivery of his talks at concerts. Way
too serious and broken. Rich had a way of being broken and still showed
a child like love of Jesus in his words, but in the movie he was always
angry. And one thing that bugged me is that his haircut seemed to
change on a whim. A sequence with short hair was followed by a sequence
with long hair and a beard and then back to short hair - over and over.
May sound silly, but as far as movie production goes that should not
happen.

Overall, it is a good insight to a man struggling with his faith. And
the Brennan Manning character was great.",1399766400,8,670,4.075757575757576

6289838,4,B00IRLISLM,"ATTENTION: SPOILER ALERT!!

This movie is a raw, bare-knuckled, account of a saint struggling with life and his own ""demons"" (for lack of a better analogy) in fighting to keep his faith within a genuine ""brokenness"" of soul and spirit.  He lived honestly and protested the ""polished"" life of many who hide their struggles while judging others within a typical hypocrisy found everywhere in Scripture.  If you want a bright and shiny, life is free of struggles, and victorious righteousness in overcoming the world then you will certainly disappointed.  This was a about a man who truly loved God in the midst of his struggles and made a conscious choice NOT to hide his struggles because he knew he would never overcome these struggles if his brothers and sisters did not know the issues within his life.  How can the body of Christ pray for one another if we hide our struggles?  He had a ""transparent courage"" with people and with God and never excused his struggles and sin as something ""he just needed to live with"".  You could tell he wanted victory but he wasn't about to stop praising and loving God because that victory eluded him at certain moments in his life.  It's easy to criticize someone who doesn't hide behind a ""moral obligation"" in order to disguise the very things they want to overcome.  He didn't butt heads with others because he was a ""jerk"" but because he couldn't reconcile his own desire for righteousness while dealing with an unrighteous music industry that he thought was double minded and disingenuous.  Even when he went too far as with the record producer, he mowed the producers lawn the next day.  When the producer's wife said ""who is that"" the producer responded ""it's Rich Mullens mowing our lawn.  When asked: ""what is he doing that"" he responded ""to say he's sorry"".  The producers understood Rich in his struggle and Rich truly loved them evidenced by his hurt response when he found out that they left the company.  He wanted a semblance of order in a life that was constantly ""on the go"" and got upset when those who offered stability in his life (even if the relationships were strained at times) moved on.

Rich's foundation as a child was built on a rigid father who could never understand or accept that God had a different plan for his son other than being a mechanic and a farmer. Farmers historically need and expect their sons to be ""helping hands"" when they are old enough. And when a piano takes the place of a tractor it can cause considerable distress for a father expecting help from the day his son is born. His mother's comments about how much his father loved him didn't square with how he was treated which is obviously confusing for a child...and eventually grew weary of his mother's apologist and placating attitude when speaking of his father's ""love"" for him.  That wound needed to be healed, and until it was Rich was going to struggle.  Having God fill that void is easier said than done and it seemed Rich sought answers in the flesh instead of accepting it and allowing God to be a healing balm.  But when you have a father who instills in you a sense of weakness or worthlessness like Rich did, it's not about the father's insensitive and selfish rigidity, it's about Rich feeling that he was the problem and that it was his fault that he didn't measure up to his father's expectations.  And as long as his father resented his son's choice of profession, that wound would not be healed in the natural.  There's nothing quite complex and distressing than being the son of a presumptuous father who had predesigned plans for his son and God calling this son to be something totally opposite of the father's expectations.

There was nothing in Rich's character that suggested to me that his carnal ways in dealing with his deep issues and brokenness were deliberate and willful acts against God.  In fact he was pursuing God in his struggles which is why I believe God sent Pastor Brennan into his life.  The mercy of God doesn't solve our problems, it only allows for us to be imperfect as we seek Him, and His love and righteousness, in our lives AS HE CHANGES US.  Rich did not do well with the worldliness of fame and those who represented God and the lures of money.  He identified with the lowly and downtrodden because he felt more like one of them in the midst of fame and wealth which was exemplified in his visiting the Indian Reservations.  It seemed to me that he wanted to be there and was conflicted with his life as a musician because he wanted the simple life with the lowly yet loved the stage of praise and worship that produced a message he wanted to deliver yet without the baggage of fame and wealth.

I never knew Rich and all of my observations are mere speculation based solely on the movie.  Maybe Rich relied more on music than Scripture for his healing.  Or maybe he struggled like many of us to have the faith that takes God at His Word to provide the healing and intimacy that Rich needed.  Regardless, it was obvious that Rich loved God genuinely and wanted to please Him like he wanted to please his earthly father but just couldn't let go of his need to completely understand the ""why's?"" and ""how comes?"" to satisfy his other need to be accepted for who he was rather than constantly questioning why he was never ""good enough"" or ""worthy"" of his earthly father's love and acceptance.  Eventually with Pastor Brennan's help, Rich was able to see a semblance of his father's love for him under his rigid and stoic demeanor.  Scripture says that God will not despise and contrite and broken heart.  When it came to God Rich seemed every bit contrite and broken before God and he was never ashamed of the God he so loved and praised throughout his life.",1498435200,,5749,4.5939334637964775

6289865,2,B00IRLISLM,"There is a documentary on YouTube about Rich, I'd heavily recommend you save your money and watch it rather than this. ""Ragamuffin"" presents a very B rated presentation of a B rated version of an A rated life.

Aside from terrible acting, a poor script and, ironically enough, an overused and underwhelming score, the movie dwells on the aspects of Mullin's life which are least controversial and most in line with a liberal-progressive interpretation of the life of a modern saint. Overplaying Rich's volatile relationship with his father, underplaying the comitment he had to serving the poor and finding Christ in communion with the Church, completely omitting Rich's dedication to eccemunalism (let alone his cooperation with and growing admiration for the Catholic Church), this film presents a banal story of the misunderstood, depressed young artist who fights the system and dies young. The Ragamuffin Gospel is presented as a cheap form of psycho therapy where surrender means giving up but without the radical discipleship Rich saught.

I love Rich Mullins music and his Monistry, his legacy inspires me as I serve as a missionary in Siberia, but this film does neither his art nor his memory justice.

Save yourself the trouble, watch the documentary or just spend an evening watching his concerts on YouTube. Unlike in this film, you'll see clearly how Rich's sorrow and depression, his struggles and doubts, were balance through his relationship with Christ by joy.",1480636800,3,1478,5.175732217573222

6289867,3,B00IRLISLM,"This film is an unvarnished biography of the life and career of musical artist Rich Mullins. I have a few of his albums and have always enjoyed his music, and while I knew he had a reputation for being a maverick in the Christian music industry, I never knew just how hard his life apparently was.

If this film is to be believed, Mullins grew up with an abusive and emotionally distant father, he had his heart broken by the woman he loved and never really got over it, he struggled with alcoholism and smoking, he was almost perpetually depressed, he was co-dependent, he simultaneously enjoyed and despised his success, and he had doubts about his faith and what it meant to be a Christian. Like I said, if this film is to be believed. Not knowing much about Mullins' personal life, I can't say one way or another, but the film's depiction of the artist does seem at odds with the end credit clips which show the real Rich Mullins exhibiting a sense of humor and hope that was almost entirely absent from the script. This suggests to me that this movie could have been a little more balanced instead of constantly beating us over the head with despair and the existential crisis of the human condition.

The acting is generally good throughout, and Michael Koch in the central role turns in a solid performance. The script, however, never seems to find a rhythm and falls into a hole in the second act that it never manages to climb out of, effectively grinding the story to a halt as Mullins meanders from one episode of depression to the next. If you know anything about Rich Mullins' life then you'll know how the story ends, but if you don't then it'll hit you across the face like a 2x4. It's random, unexpected, and depressing, but that's life, and it's what really happened, so I can't fault the filmmakers for it. But at the same time, it leaves the viewer stuck in the second act hole, and it seems they could have done something to lift us out of it and leave us with a sense of hope. After all, the central theme of Mullins' music and ministry was that no matter how many times life knocks you down, God will always be there to pick you up.

I think the biggest mark against this film is how it butchers Rich Mullins' music. All the songs are performed by Michael Koch who unfortunately lacks Mullins' range and is often noticeably off-key. If you're going to do a movie about a musician then at least find someone who can do the music justice! Or use the age-old practice of lip-syncing. There's no shame in it in this scenario, and it would have been far preferable to the discordant performance we got here.

I appreciate what the filmmakers set out to achieve. Rich Mullins was an unconventional Christian musician, and this movie is an unconventional depiction of his life which, according to the filmmakers, was raw and messy, but then a lot of lives are. I respect that. Too many biographical films feature nice, neat narrative arcs that are nothing like reality. Unfortunately, this film is hampered by a messy, unstructured script, a lack of joy, and sub-par musical performances.",1479600000,3,3103,4.565529622980251

6289882,5,B00IRLISLM,"Personal: I have been a fan of Mullins since about 1992. I still listen to his albums quite often. I was very pleased and moved by this movie.

In regard to production: The movie is very well done. It gives you a glimpse in to his life that many who followed his music were surprised to see. There are flashbacks to earlier life experiences that tie up the movie. The coverage of his life over the years seems to be accurate in regards to his music career, friends, concerts, and even the quotes of his.

About the character: This guy ran against the grain of what was expected from a contemporary christian musician in the 80s to the late 90s. He caught a lot of slack for it, too. What he did was he said things that were real. He laid down the idea of what people expected Christians to look and act like. He opened up the long closed box of the reality of being a Christian; the reality that we mess up, we have flaws, we are not what we do, and regardless of how hard we try or how much we screw up-- and we will screw up a lot-- God still holds on to us.",1474070400,,1060,4.0669856459330145

6289889,3,B00IRLISLM,"Not bad, very slow moving, not sure why ratings have been so high? Richard Mullins was not that interesting. Somehow I think the story only got high ratings for having a male protagonist, not sure, but when I imagine a similar story line with the main character being female, I don't think it would have been rated that highly. The story line just wasn't that great. Maybe a father/son story that I didn't t quite grasp or appreciate. Not terrible, just a little boring and slow.",1469664000,,479,4.5813953488372094

6289891,4,B00IRLISLM,"As a longtime fan of Rich Mullins, I felt this was a great representation of his story and message.  The film is above standard for most Christian movies, and with the open story of his own struggles with alcoholism, it felt less preachy and more biographical.  I feel the story could have done without some ofthe churchy things, but since it was true to Rich, it fit in this case.

Of course you can only squeeze so much into a movie, and this movie is well focused on the parts Rich did not show to the mainstream.  I sense how he felt shoe-horned into a polished, homogenized Christian package that just didn't fit. I've listened to Rich since junior high in the late 80's and as I listen now (or sing loudly in my car!), the songs are even more moving and comforting.",1468368000,,531,4.31

6289897,5,B00IRLISLM,"From the very foist time I heard Rich perform as an opening act for the Amy Grant Unguarded tour in Dallas I was a fan.  Over the years I collected every single album Rich ever recorded, as well as every magazine that published an interview with him.  There was something inspiring and intriguing about Rich, and he never seemed to try and hide his faults like so many of us do.

This movie portrayed the Rich I had imagined from all of the reading I had done on him as a young man, and while some names were changed I can't help but believe that the movie is fairly accurate.  It was great to see some of the things that made him tick, and molded him into the man he became.  I enjoyed the movie very much, and thought the acting was great.  I am not a movie critic so others may have a different opinion, but I would watch it again.

6289916,3,B00IRLISLM,"I don't know why people liked this film so much. The character that played Rich seemed to express an attitude more than the Rich I see in concerts and when he shared on video. Also, the focus on his sin struggles seemed to dominate the movie more than a sense of God's reality in his life. I'm sure he had a lot more joyful times as well and also testimonies of God's working. But, overall the movie just was depressing. We are going to watch some actual concerts of Rich to get back to who Rich really was. I'm not saying that Rich didn't struggle with alcohol, smoking, etc. but it seemed liked the movie just made this so BOLD and overshadowed the whole plot.
I thought if a movie were made of my life like this it would be like zeroing in on the valleys I've went through and leaving out a lot of the triumphs and joys.",1458259200,3,823,4.182389937106918

6289924,1,B00IRLISLM,"Truly awful, I've never wanted a rental refund so badly.  I had high hopes for this movie based on the description and some reviews, but about 1/2 way through this VERY, interminably long flick I was fast forwarding, hoping something, really anything would actually happen?  It never did.  Endless scene after endless scene of the main character on stage spouting what I suppose was supposed to pass for wisdom and instead came off as some stoned guy.  The main character sports a wig through half of the movie (and oddly off and on throughout) that is so distracting you can't really see or hear anything else but the Awful Wig.  Nowhere in this movie does Mullins come off as an actual follower of Christ,  instead he just comes off as an insufferable jerk.

6289957,4,B00IRLISLM,"I've read many of the reviews about this movie-and I do see some of the flaws people mention. By the time Rich died his aging was pretty accelerated-the sun, alcohol, cigarettes and pain will do that-and the actor was not portrayed as looking as shop-worn as Rich did. I read one person who took issue with some of the license taken with chronology. Several others said that Koch's singing voice was no match for Rich's voice. These are legitimate criticisms. Certainly Rich's voice was incomparable. But having said that, I really liked this movie. I was a huge fan of his music and I went to see him in concert every chance I got. I played The World as Best as I Remember It (parts one and two) constantly-in my car-in my house. I had all of his albums but those 2 were my favorites.  I also loved Liturgy... The Jesus album-oh heck-I loved them all. But it was always clear that his creativity-the brilliance of his body of work-was forged in fire and born of enormous pain. So this movie came as no surprise to me. All the other movies, documentaries, interviews, and articles I've seen and read allude to his ""demons."" This movie just lays it out on the table-so we are not left wondering exactly what his demons are. The movie demonstrates clearly that ""God met Rich in the furnace a long time 'fore he met him in the sky."" (from TWABAIRI, part one, I think) The actor did not play Rich as nearly as wry and funny and cynical as he was in his concerts-but he did a great job of portraying that blunt, touching honesty that was quintessentially Rich Mullins. I cried several times-his pain was hard to watch. But I liked that he wasn't always likable or mature or whole-that is the messiness of life and the truth about real people-certainly the damaged ones. I found myself frustrated with his attitudes about many things-but that's ok too-perfect people are intimidating and hard to relate to for those of us with feet of clay. I want to watch it again-it's inspired me to go back and research him-which I have not done in several years. Unlike many watchers-I have long since left evangelical Christianity-so his ability to believe in the face of depression and despair seems to me a true testament to his faith. A few reviews have suggested that there is a ""gay"" undertone-that seems a stretch to me-though as the mother of a gay son, I have no problem with that. I thought this was extremely well done. Not perfect, but neither was he-and beauty is often hidden in the imperfections.",1439510400,11,2493,4.564732142857143
6289958,5,B00IRLISLM,Rich Mullins was awesome but this world was not his home . .

6289966,5,B00IRLISLM,"The movie opened up my eyes to the concept of Gods love. I've spent weeks thinking about the question from God ""did you really believe that I loved you"". Seeing how Rich struggled with so many vices including a past that tainted his views and yet was able to write such powerful songs (that I truly believe are being sung in Heaven) is amazing. A MUST watch for anyone struggling with feelings accepted by Christ.",1437523200,,413,4.52

Really enjoyed :)",1437436800,,102,4.15
6289968,5,B00IRLISLM,"Its a bittersweet movie. I remember hearing Richs songs on the radio in the late 1980s and early 90s. They were of course very popular and all my friends seem to really like them. I was working with junior highers at the time so naturally I sang Awesome God several million times, even learned to play it on guitar. But his music never really interested me. His songs seemed melancholy and sullen. Then while living in Big Fork Montana I went to see Rich in concert at The Christians Center in Kalispell. I didn't know more than a couple of his songs, but I went because it was something to do.

I was totally blown away! I heard the longing of a heart so in love with Jesus that it radiated from his voice and through his instruments. Needless to say I began purchasing Richs music after that wonderful night. Rich sang about life, his music is real. Some of it is melancholy, but sometimes life can be that way. Through the times when you feel like dancing and singing praise to the Lord, to the times of heartache, loneliness and longing, Rich proved you can glorify God all the same.

Only one other singer has affected me as strongly as Rich Mullins, that is Keith Green (though I never saw Keith in concert). Tragically both men left us far too soon.

Until the movie, I never knew what haunted Rich. The movie is bitter for the sadness Rich endured, but sweet because of the faithfulness of the Savior he steadfastly followed.",1437350400,5,1433,4.461832061068702

6289971,4,B00IRLISLM,I have always loved Mullins music and was very interested in his public life and how he became a great writer of music and performer of his music. Sad that he died so young.

6289976,5,B00IRLISLM,"Right up there with ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""The Mission"" as one the best Christian themed movies I have ever seen. I call it a ""Christian themed"" movie rather than a ""Christian"" movie because it was made to tell a story that happens to contain, in addition to other themes, a Christian theme. Christian movies are made with an intention that goes beyond the story to religious mission. I am not saying that is right or wrong but these kind of movies tend to be sanitized to a great degree (sometimes embarrassingly so), where Christian themed movies are often very real and sometimes raw. This does not make them good in themselves. To be good, the Christian themed movie, like all movies, has to be well done. The story, performances and execution has to grab, move and affect you and this is certainly the case with Ragamuffin. It is very real and very well done. The actor who plays Rich is amazing. If I had one small criticism, it would be that the portrayal did not capture Rich's whimsy, sarcasm and tongue-in-cheek humor as much as I would have liked. But overall, this is an moving, powerful and very well made movie that honors an amazing life.",1434499200,,1154,4.579710144927536
6289977,2,B00IRLISLM,"I knew that Rich Mullins battled the issues with his father, but the movie seems to get stuck on it.

6289980,5,B00IRLISLM,"Rich has touched my heart & my life in many ways.  What a gifted brother in Christ with his songwriting and music.  What an inspirational brother in Christ with how he loved his neighbors, not money.  His transparency with his struggles in life gives me HOPE in knowing how to walk with Christ & knowing that I am forgiven.  I thank the Lord for showing me grace & mercy through Rich.  The movie was good enough for me to buy, but I definitely agree with a lot of other comments.  If you look up his music, concerts and interviews on Youtube, you will find he had a genuine love for Jesus & God, and was very humble himself.  I also love his dry humor!  The movie is dark when you compare it with his real-life concerts & interviews, but I feel like it is true since his brother and best friends wrote, directed and played in the movie.  To sum it up, Rich was given an ""awesome"" gift from God, which he used to the best of his ability.  He was also human & was not perfect, always trying to overcome his demons.  The good news?  He's in Heaven with our loving Father, singing his praises!  I look forward to singing with him when I am called Home, too.  Nothing on earth is perfect; not Rich, not us, not the movie.  But God allowed us a glimpse of a saved man's life and what it means to live daily for Him, faults and all.  Thank you for sharing, Rich.",1433548800,,1355,4.173745173745174

6289993,1,B00IRLISLM,"As a teacher, I would give this film a grade of INCOMPLETE because it focused solely on one aspect of Rich's life.  I understand that the intent was to speak a certain message to a certain audience and God obviously used it for that. Hopefully people who didn't know his music or multifaceted message will dig a little deeper. I just keep thinking about one of Rich's favorite quotes, ""God spoke to Balaam through his ass and He has been speaking through asses ever since"". Rich wouldn't care if this film was accurate or complete. He would only care if somebody knew God better because of it.",1430092800,,593,4.542056074766355
6289994,3,B00IRLISLM,"If this movie were a complete and true reflection of the man, I would not want to have anything to do with him.

I found the movie highly critical of Rich Mullins.  I think they focused too excessively on the negativeness and struggles of his life, instead of the positive influences of his life and ministry.  The people behind the production of the movie are the people who knew him best from my understanding; so it is what it is.

Being a fan of Rich Mullins, I am aware of the struggles and challenges that he dealt with.  I also understand the desire to be honest in the reflection of his life to address these issues. Striking the balance can be challenging.

Though it is the struggles that Rich Mullins dealt with and his blunt honestly, which are a major contributor to why his music is so pure and encouraging for others who have similar struggles.  Which I suppose is all of us.",1429833600,4,890,4.423312883435583

Excellent portrayal of the life of Rich Mullins.  It is a true representation of a man who was a very real individual and who loved God.  The movie does not hide the faults of the individual nor does it hide the passion that made him a ""man after God's own heart.""  It is a story of an intersting, talented individual, whose struggle with his own darkness made him authentic because he didn't pretty himself up for an image.  While Rich Mullin's lived I had the opportunity to see him in concert.  Tickets for concerts sold for $20-$25 at the time.  He charged $5.00!

I truly believe owning your brokenness is essential for humility, kindness, and mental health. I am married to the most wonderful man in the world. He also happens to be a recovering alcoholic of 17 years. I am astonished by the prejudice and ignorance he has faced regarding this, as well as his struggles with depression. I am so thankful the film makers gave credence to these issues. They effect the lives of some very successful and lovely people from all walks of life.

We like most people feel like hes this great friend that, we never met (unfortunately). We all identified with him in some way or other, you just felt that he wasn't going to sit in judgement on you.  As the movie progresses you can see the twin tensions of a heart for God on one hand and his brokensness on the other and how that played itself out in different ways. The movie has a lot of artistic shots that are so captivating to the viewer, the pce is quick but covers alot of ground.  It was nice to hear alot of the famous quotes from Rich as well as Brennan. I wondered how much Karl Barths writing influenced his thinking.  Also I was worried if his music would come across from the Actor portraying Rich (MIchael Koch) but those fears were cast aside as he did an amazing job acting the part as well as singing.  I was choking back emotions most of the way through especially when Mitch McVickers character came on the scene y know and just thinking what he must be feeling as he sees this actor playing out the past.  I could go on.  Suffice it to say this was an awesome effort by everybody involved in the project Richs life and legacy impacted many people and i am glad his story is out there on film.",1425945600,2,1344,4.1461538461538465

But the movie got me interested in finding out more about Rich Mullins.  I started devouring anything I could find on him; videos, books, interviews.  The man I found was not the same man this movie depicted.  Period.  Rich Mullins may have had his demons, like we all do, but he was also a man full of Christian joy from being completely in love with God.  He was witty and funny and well, joyful.  None of this was depicted in the movie.

I thought that when I saw the actor playing Rich it would take away from the film, at first it did, but after about 10 minutes I was sucked into the story and I forgot it was someone else acting as Rich Mullins.  This is the true story of a modern day saint (he died in 1999(?))  I think the amazing thing about Rich is that he was authentic all his life and stuck to what he believed was right.

I truly, truly, truuuly appreciate the people who made this. I can't believe we now have a view of who the man behind Awesome God was. Rich was such a real fella. He had so much heartache and pain, yet God kept Him always, and gave him joy in the time of sorrow. I can so relate. At times I even doubt if God is there, but it's just the little things like the soul of this movie that bring me back. Rich, I was born in 1994 and only knew of you from my parents cassette player, so I'm now JUST getting to know you through this movie and Youtube of course. WHAT A LOSS, the CCM music industry had in 1997. I miss him soooooo much. Can't even describe how much your songs like My One Thing, Awesome God, Hold Me Jesus, Creed, While The Nations Rage, and Sing Your Praise To The Lord have ministered to me! The film was a bit gloomy to capture the realness of his situations, but I would have loved to seem more of Rich's happy times, to create the balance. However, the effort in this film was phenomenal in my opinion. Great job guys! I honestly would love to see a film on all of my favorite CCM or Gospel singers now lol. But man....Rich, God be with you...I miss you so much...and I cannot wait to meet you on the other side. 4.5  stars because I feel like they could have captured his humor and happy side a little more, as we can see in his concerts :)",1422230400,6,1524,4.06312292358804

I would hate to ruin it by putting any label on this film for fear some might miss seeing it excepting the typical Plasticine Christian fare.  Rich Mullins in some ways was the Curt Cobain of Christian music.  This film is a good human drama with beautiful scenery and done with high artistic quality.  Actors, Production, and Story deserve 5 Stars.  Amazing what people can do on what is assumed a small budget.  It doesn't show.  Really, it's that good.

6290059,1,B00IRLISLM,"I'm a Christian but this was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Though it's supposed to be based on the life of Rich Mullins, all this movie consisted of was a guy with ratty/snarled-looking hair, torn jeans, and no shoes. The music sung didn't seem ""authentic"", his faith portrayed was ""lukewarm"" at best, plus you can tell from the movie that the main movie character was ""gay"". Even though they didn't come right out and say it in the movie, they most certainly HINTED at it all throughout the movie. (For any true readers of the bible, we know from both the Old AND New Testaments that homosexual ""lust"" is SIN!)

Just about EVERY single scene seemed to be focused on his ratty/snarled-looking hair, ripped jeans and no shoes, I couldn't stand it! When you look at pictures of the REAL life Rich Mullins, his hair does NOT look ""snarly-looking"" at all! In fact, his hair looks quite nice. So why the movie people felt the need to portray him as ""snarly-haired looking"" is beyond me.

I think the only thing interesting about this movie was how they portrayed his father, a hard-working farmer. I think it was likely an accurate depiction of the father. And the scene where he was on the Navajo reservation wasn't bad, either. I DO like some of the narration. But the rest of this movie just plain sucked. It wasn't edifying to my faith at all. I don't see HOW so  many people can call this a good Christian movie when 98% of it focused on his ratty-looking hair and torn jeans (like, SERIOUSLY!)

Don't get me wrong: I know that the good Lord judges us by what's on the INSIDE of our souls and not on the OUTSIDE (outward appearances). But come on, people! This is a MOVIE! Not a low-budget church play! Having the main character with ratty-looking hair and torn jeans all throughout the movie just ruined it for me.",1420934400,4,1834,4.515060240963855

I'm sure there were a lot more ""brighter"" days in his life... But trying to get all the pivotal things into a film... Makes his life perhaps look darker than it was. Wish it had shown more of his work on the Rez. I felt it was a challenging, heart touching, film. Just awesome! It's odd that I just read about St. Francis entering the monastic movement somewhere this week and here in the film it was stated that had really been a pivotal thing in Rich's life Early on. I guess Its safe to say... I loved the movie and think there are parts of it that will touch various people here and there, depending on their lives. Many helpful lessons I the film.

6290099,5,B00IRLISLM,"I stumbled onto Ragamuffin while cruising my library's DVD section. Quite happy that I did. Being introduced to Rich Mullin's music is a true gift. And considering I follow Buddhist principles, it's nice to know that someone can put out a movie about a Christian Gospel singer that has widespread appeal. Of course Rich himself could give a darn, but with his brother's blessing this little film has grown wings. Telling Rich's story means telling it like it is and shooting from the hip as Rich did, always. Never candy coated, or bottled for general consumption the fact that he didn't fit in, didn't follow the rules and rose above his struggles is all to our benefit. As a wealthy singer-songwriter he chose to live on less. And while some may cringe at his torn jeans and scraggly hair the dude was the real thing and one not often shown in mainstream movies. You of course can find this movie here at Amazon but I recommend filling out one of those cards at your local library to suggest they buy a copy and help to spread the word. Indie films like this are a blessing to those of us who don't fit in and like to have our stories told so the other ""ragamuffins"" can see they're not alone.

6290100,5,B00IRLISLM,"O M Goodness...I just accidentally watched the most amazing movie. Amazing in so far as how much I identified with it and how it spoke to me.  I had Netflix open on my tablet and was browsing through the movies and my little finger twitched and bumped the tablet opening up a movie I hadn't intended to click on.  I thought well let's see what it's about anyway, since it's opening.
  It's called Ragamuffin and it's the story of Christian singer/songwriter Rich Mullins. (Think ""Our God is an Awesome God"", ""Hold Me, Jesus"" and others).
  I wound up crying like a baby...and yet there was so much good teaching in it about Jesus that I so needed...  It was a serious God thing.
  It brought back a lot of painful memories of my own growing up...
  If you get the chance, watch it.... I plan to get the DVD. I need to get what he spoke in his concerts and outside them about Jesus deep into me...",1416960000,3,896,4.3053892215568865
6290101,2,B00IRLISLM,"I struggled with this movie.

I have loved Rich Mullins work for years.  Listened to his music.  Bought CDs and even the ""Here in America"" DVD/audio CD.  As you listened to him sing and speak, it was clear that he was a real person, sharing poetry and music from his real world perspective.  The music grew out of pain and suffering, out of a desire to be truly honest about his success and failures.  I had hoped that they could show this conflict in a genuine and interesting way.

The film is quite dark.  If there is a theme that is drawn through the movie, it is that Rich's relationship with his father tempered his perception of God and the rest of his life.  Dave Mullins, Rich's brother and one of the producers of the film, has commented that his dad grew a lot over time and that while Dave could see it, Rich just never could come to terms with his father.

Most of the other characters feel pretty flat.  Even Rich, as portrayed by the movie, is a caricature of himself -- none of the moments of humor that came up frequently when he was doing his little between songs narrations -- just preaching about the hypocrisy of others.

In construction, the movie has a very muddy course.  There does not seem to be any unifying direction to the events chosen to make up the film -- just random times when Rich pontificates to record execs and crowds, times when he is drinking and times when he is angry at friends, for apparently no reason.

The movie itself is way too long.  It needed serious editing and rewriting.  A lot of the dialog is pretty stilted.  The speeches that Rich delivers between songs are ones that I have heard before.  Many of them are taken pretty verbatim from the ""Here in America"" DVD/CD performance, although there, of course, Rich Mullins was playing himself and there was less preachiness and more humor.

By concentrating wholly on pain, suffering, and self-destruction, the movie suffers much.  It is clear that Rich Mullins had issues -- lots of issues.  But he also gave generously to people in need, taught Navajo kids music, and really enjoyed interacting with people at concerts.  To only show the negative side of Rich's character is to ignore the duality that made him interesting.

The biggest deficit in the movie is the lack of redemption and healing that Rich finds.  Most of the movie is spent wallowing in his suffering and self-destructive behaviors.  Even after he meets Brennan Manning, there is no true feeling of redemption.  The next to last scene shows him lashing out at one of his friends in a way that leaves the viewer convinced that he has learned nothing and is the same person as at the beginning of the journey.  Definitely not a satisfying end, to say the least.

The only saving grace of the movie is the use of Rich Mullins' songs, which are excellent, although not as well performed in the movie as he did.

I probably won't watch this again.  There wasn't enough good to wallow through the darkness.",1416787200,4,2971,4.561436672967864

6290112,5,B00IRLISLM,"Inspiring Christian theme movie, a docu-drama. People today are exposed to the Joel Osteen ""everything is roses"" Christian life, and Osteen's a heretics and his message is false. Christ said in Luke 9:23 ""If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.""  This movie puts that personal cross in the foreground and in Rich Mullins case it honestly depicts a hard-edgy life that could have been lived better if Rich had been more obedient, more Christ-like. Mullins life is an authentic example that real Christians can have real problems. It's also a story that indirectly tells how a father's abusive (critical), unsupported, treatment of Rich (different from his siblings) as a child put Rich on life's course with something he shouldn't have had to overcome, except his story told to movie goers may glorify God as does his unique music. Amy Grant plays herself in this music-loaded drama. Rich was a missionary to the Navajo Indians, he loved them and denied career opportunities to be there (Window Rock, AZ). Rich also directed his agent to pay him a typical unskilled layman's wages to live on and to give the rest away. That's what his agent did making Mullins a very effective giver to the Lord's work. Rich never knew how much money he really made, he stayed completely detached from that.",1415664000,,1346,4.801724137931035

It really shows how these kind of things can haunt us all our lives, until we can come to that point of true forgiveness and healing from past wounds.  Rich Mullins story also shows the real, underlying root cause of alcoholism or drug addiction: unresolved, unaddressed inner pain.  Too often the symptoms of our real issues are all that get addressed - or attempted to resolve - but the unresolved pain will keep one in their addictions, looking for relief.  Jesus Christ is THE only One Who can heal damaged emotions, who can remove pain from hurtful memories, and restore the heart through true reconciliation and forgiveness.  This film is a very useful tool for counseling towards these ends.",1414972800,,998,4.841176470588235

6290133,3,B00IRLISLM,"This was a nice film but I'm very disappointed that they didn't portray his true self better and that they made his anxiety rooted solely in his abusive father. It's not uncommon knowledge now that he was gay and in a loving, gay relationship. Everyone close to him, crew, band, etc. knew and it wasn't a secret. But I suppose there would be a huge backlash from the conservative, evangelical world where most his audience was. Offend that audience and you lose the viewership of you're film. We're starting to see the emergence of big, Christian music artists coming out of the closet to God be the glory!

6290136,4,B00IRLISLM,"I just watched Ragamuffin. Funny how I knew so little about the artist i admired so deeply! I remember hearing ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" by Amy Grant when I walked into a Christian bookstore in the mall as a teen. I stood there for a long time listening to it, then walked out with a cassette, which I blasted on my car stereo with the windows down every chance i got. I had no idea he had written it. I had no idea who he was at the time.

It was in my 20's, when I was living a raggedy life of my own, cocktail waitressing at a pool hall, that I heard another song of his... The World As Best As I Can Remember It. What a story teller! I was hooked from then on! I bought all his albums after that. I wasn't walking any sort of path towards righteousness at the time, but his songs spoke to me. and they had a huge impact on my life.

And then in my early 30s, I had started straightening out some of the wrinkles in my life and was on my way home from church one morning, kids in the back seat, when I heard the news of his death. I pulled off the road and cried. I cried hard. I was devastated. I still get teary eyed listening to his music, and on the 20th anniversary of his death, I think I commemorated the event by spending an entire month engrossed in every youtube video I could find of his life.

Now i'm 50. I'd like to think my life is ironed out pretty well, but I still have things I don't want anyone else to know about. Thoughts that make me cringe and wonder why God puts up with me.

But not til I watched the movie did I realize he had so many struggles. And the one thought that struck me... the more screwed up we are, the more He loves us. I hate to say He loves the most screwed up among us the most, but maybe He kinda does.

BUT... I could only give this four stars because of the lack of continuity in appearance. The acting was fine, but it was filmed out of sequence. Nothing wrong with that, and I realize it's commonly done. However, the actor got a haircut at some point during the filming, and some scenes really should have been redone. In any given scene, ""Rich"" might be clean shaven with short hair one second and look unkempt with long greasy hair and a five day growth of scraggly beard the next second. The change in appearance was so radical that it took half the movie for me to realize that it wasn't two different people, two different characters.",1413590400,,2397,4.069915254237288

6290139,4,B00IRLISLM,"I really enjoyed this film. I felt the quality was particularly good for a Christian film. From a film quality perspective, the only evidence of it being a ""B"" film that I noticed was the hair that seemed to grow from short to long within a 24 hour time and the short sleeves while driving the jeep top down through land cold enough for snow - unless of course Rich was more hot blooded than I am!

I understand some people complaints of the darkness of the film, but that's what I love most about Rich's story. Its raw. Its not glossy. Its real life for many people, struggling with vices, relationships, and loneliness while at the same time truly believing God's love and forgiveness. Kind of like Robert Duvall's character in ""The Apostle"" - Rich is a redeemed broken sinner.

I noticed the DVD version is nearly an hour shorter. I can't imagine what was cut to achieve the reduced time. I felt gripped through most of this 2+ hour flick. And now, thank you Spotify, I'm re-listening to his music.",1413331200,,1001,4.4945054945054945

6290141,1,B00IRLISLM,"What Christian wouldn't connect with the message of Grace? This movie is ostensibly about Grace. But it's also the darkest, most depressing movie I've seen in a while!
How can that be?

Almost everything good about Rich's life was hidden, while everything BAD was aired out for what felt like hours. It was PAINFULLY long, full of a lot of junk, and almost no music.

Please read the other one-star reviews and you'll get a better picture.

They portrayed Mullins as if he was a seeker, that he simply couldn't handle life (and a lot of other things I won't go into here).

And they made him into a hipster.

Did I mention they skipped his music? And his ministry?

The clips they played of the REAL Mullins during the credits was very telling. They chose a joke. A JOKE!

Pardon me but I doubt very much that if Rich had one quote or one live clip he'd like to share... it wouldn't be that one.

It seems to me this movie was made with an agenda to use Rich Mullins as a tool to spread the message of Brennan Manning. Like Manning's message, there is some truth in the movie, but also a lot of untruth too. And it is oh-so dark.

With so much MORE to the story, and MORE to Christianity, this movie is an awful representation of his life. I mean AWFUL. Not many movies have ever given me a headache, but it did!

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. And I mean ANYone.

Really, WHY make a movie about the darkness and leave it at that? Where is the hope that Rich had? Where is the faith? The truth that Rich sang about is TOTALLY avoided and lost in this movie.

He may have made mistakes, had struggles, and been drawn off course because of the influence of people like the ones who directed this film.

I regret watching except now I can tell others what kind of skewed perspective on Rich this movie promotes. Shame on its writers and producers for sinking so low and exposing thousands to these dark wanton messages.",1413072000,10,1920,4.329608938547486

6290148,5,B00IRLISLM,"I had intended to write a review quite some time ago and hadn't gotten around to it.  But a friend just asked me ""Do you know how accurate the movie actually is?""... which prompted me to write this tome in response:

My impression is it's pretty accurate.  Of the few less-than-stellar reviews the film has received on various web sites, many of them cite that it is dark and depressing.  This is what makes a lot of people think it might not be accurate.  But here's what I know.  Rich's family, in particular his brother David, repeatedly turned down requests to do movies on Rich's life in the 15 or so years following his death... until ""Ragamuffin"".  Not only that, but David Mullins, I believe, worked closely with writer/director/co-star David Leo Schultz as a consultant on the movie.  At least one of Rich's long-time real life friends plays a role in the movie, and one of his inmost circle, Sam Howard, plays the role of his own father, Maurice Howard, who was a mentor/father figure to Rich.

Furthermore, the documentary on the making of ""Ragamuffin"", called ""Rich Mullins: A Ragamuffin's Legacy"", bears out a lot of the darkness and struggles with which Rich dealt in life, particularly in interviews with his closest friends from Cincinnati Bible College (including the aforementioned Sam Howard).  The ""Legacy"" documentary can almost be seen as a companion to the film, and I personally think it should be watched in close succession to ""Ragamuffin"".

There are at least one or two items of artistic license taken in the feature film.  One, revealed in the documentary, has to do with where exactly Rich was when a pivotal event in his life happened (I won't reveal here what that event was so as not to provide a spoiler).  However, the spirit of the event, and how it affected Rich, are true.

I believe most viewers who end up taken aback or disillusioned by how dark and truly messed up the Rich Mullins portrayed in ""Ragamuffin"" was, especially in contrast to how joyous and ebullient he usually was in concert, either don't see how the ""two faces of Rich"" could've coexisted or think that the film overemphasized the conflicts he went through.  I can definitely see the point in the latter; it was certainly, shall we say, eye-opening for me, though I'd heard some slight indications of the kind of person Rich could be at times from a couple of people I've known who knew Rich somewhat.

Be that all as it may, I think that ""Ragamuffin"" neither can be nor was meant to be an exhaustive, encyclopedic account of all facets of Rich's life; nor a dispassionate, balanced documentary (that's more what ""Legacy"" is).  It is somewhere on the spectrum between a fictitious account that is ""based on a true story"" or ""inspired by the life of"" and a documentary biopic that presents the hard facts only.  It is decidedly closer to the latter on that spectrum, but it is, like all films, vastly colored by the vision of the writer/director, and in this case, David Leo Schultz did his research (this is apparent), but was not a compadre of Rich, and as such will never be 100% accurate.

THAT being said, 100% accuracy is not the reason to see or not see this movie.  It is, in my frank opinion, a tour de force of a film that celebrates the triumph of God's grace and love in the lives of even the most broken of us.  It offers nearly solid proof that we need not clean up our act before God will love, accept, and use us for His glory... and further, unfortunate, proof that His love, acceptance and use of us does not shield us from our fears and drive away our demons once and for all.

And for me, who didn't hear about Rich's death until three days after the fact, who was two thousand miles away from the nearest memorial service, seeing the movie served for me as a long-awaited memorial service.  It was cathartic.  It was, I remarked afterward, the best time I ever had while sobbing on and off for two hours.  I thought it was well done in virtually all respects (even star Michael Koch's unkempt hair and impression of Rich's singing voice, which were other sources of complaint for some but with which I had no problem).  I've purchased at least five copies since the DVD came out and have given them away to friends.  I have an extra copy on hand in case another such opportunity arises; and if and when I give that one away, I'll go buy another.  Such is my affinity for this movie.",1412640000,,4410,4.562182741116751

6290150,5,B00IRLISLM,"This movie immensely touched my heart from the down to earth God seeking man Rich was to the brokenness most of us walk through, struggling, triumphing and doing it over and over again while trying to discover our purpose in our great Father ""Abba"" through Jesus. He was raised the way many of us were,in criticism and never feeling adequate looking to find our true self, some of us find it in finding our identity in Christ some not.  Loved his time with Brennan, seeing his glimmer of worth and love for his dad in spite of his brokenness!  Loved his giving heart and desire to help others yet his fear of abandonment.  I have watched this twice and will watch it a few more times, Rich was a beautiful soul who left us many lessons to relate to and to learn and grow from.",1412640000,,776,4.337931034482758
6290151,2,B00IRLISLM,"I find it strange that none of the low reviews have mentioned the fact that this 'Christian' movie has so much tolerance of sin. In other words, I'm sure they could have portrayed Rich's father accurately without resorting to profanity. Do Christians not believe this is sin? Why are they doing it on purpose? I know nothing of Rich Mullins other then a few of his songs and what I learned from this movie. I fully expect to meet him in Heaven one day and will be accountable for every word spoken here. That being said, I don't agree with his definition of holiness. And the movie did NOT present the gospel. While that may not have been the purpose of the movie, we Christians should use every opportunity, especially one this huge, to share the gospel. If that was not the purpose of his entire music ministry/life, I fear he fell short of using his gift to fulfill God's purpose. For those reviewers who mentioned the movie as being dark, remember this is a biography. The movie was dark because Rich's life was dark (apparently...???). At least that's the impression I got. Not recommended due to profanity. (Drinking/alcoholism etc. can be portrayed without actually consuming it.)",1412553600,2,1187,4.739130434782608

By that time I had grown to greatly appreciate, maybe even love, the music of Rich Mullins who died that year in a tragic auto accident. I truly felt I had lost a brother. After he died I sought to read about him as much as I could because I had learned he lived in poverty as a choice he made on his own having to despise the fame that sought him out. I had learned he had a growing disdain for how people elevated him because of his talent as a musical prodigy when he wanted people to see the Christ he sung about. The acting was good, especially Michael Koch playing Mr. Mullins. It seemed to portray the man as he truly was. A man who couldn't or didn't want a facade. He was unafraid to be himself and that was the man Christ loved. It was a very honest and straightforward movie of an unpretentious man who struggled like you and me. I finally found a movie about being a Christian that says God will take any one who wants to be serious about His Son.

And that's okay.  The relationship with his father was tumultuous.  He loved sharing his heart and soul through his music rather than wanting to be a Christian entertainer.  I was so sad when I heard of his tragic death, and likewise this movie brought his story and music refreshed into my life after 10 years or more.

But if you watch closely, you will see that even through the pain, God brought great healing.

I was inspired by this movie to dig deeper in my Christian walk, loosen my hold of worldly possessions and to love others as Christ loves them.

His music was life changing for me, but this movie made me wonder how anything so powerful could've come out of a guy who was portrayed as  drunken, confused, & selfish. I really feel that he acted like a jerk most of the movie. I understand believers struggle, but the movie so heavily focused on the darkness and did very little to redeem it. I kept thinking it was going to get better and we would see how God lifted Rich out of the muck, but it didn't show that until the end...barely. If you watch Rich's real concerts or listen to his interviews he had quite a sense of humor...that wasn't shown in the movie at all.

I felt a sadness for him, because although he wrote great songs about The Lord and His goodness; did Rich ever really feel God's love. Did he believe the words that he was singing? Looking at some of the later days (1997)YouTube footage of him, he looked very sad, lonely and almost had an inebriated appearance. I feel that the movie was about the true about Rich's life, behind the scenes/out of the spotlight that he so did not enjoy. The  flaws, the good and bad, like it not or not.

I guess what keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars is that it dwells so much on his failings and struggles that doesn't leave enough time to show enough of the positive, wonderful aspects of his character that made him such a powerful voice in Christian music, the Church, and the Nashville CCM world. Because of that, people who aren't already Rich-ophiles may get a distorted view of the man. Rich, like anyone else in ministry, is a deeply flawed individual that God used for His glory. He was more honest and more gifted than most, and has left us an incredible example, for all his failings. More than anything else, the movie reminds me what a hole in the world was left when he was taken from us. I miss you, Mr. Mullins. And I only shook your hand once after a concert in 1992.

Don't we all struggle, don't we all have a deep hurt that unresolved is left to wield damage in our lives and influence decisions we make which are not necessarily good for us?
If I may, the words said to Rich by his father when he was young and made mistakes. Those harmful words became a curse to Rich and affected everything important to him. Words are powerful and once uttered into the universe by our mouths, become part of reality. You can't take them back. I felt that familiar sting when those scenes came up in the movie. Don't we all have a story to tell?
It has been through careful and deep study of the Scriptures, that knowledge of the power of the tongue to bless or curse has come starkly into focus.
Rich's story mimics many stories of countless others whose handicaps are not those visible, but those inside, hidden and deep. This movie hopefully can be a gift to anyone watching who has struggled with many things from words uttered without regard for their damage.

What a well made, honest, authentic, gospel focused movie.
Modern Christianity has done a great job acting perfect and completely missing the message of how the gospel applies to our life every single day, but Rich does that... And this movie conveys this message well.

I likes this movie so much more than all the other cheesy Christian movies being done these days with perfect endings and clean storylines. This was real and raw. Just like it should be. Highly recommend this movie!",1407974400,2,540,4.869565217391305

6290221,3,B00IRLISLM,"As a big fan of Rich Mullins' music and essays I was skeptical to see how his life and music would be represented in this film. I tried to love it, but I watched it only hoping it would get better. By the second hour when Brennan Manning's character entered, it did get better. The main issue I have with the movie is the acting and singing by Michael Koch. He is rather flat as an actor and the brown wig he wore through most of the movie was unbearable! I fast forwarded through all of the singing segments because his voice made Rich's songs sound pitchy and shallow. Perhaps if he had actually grown his hair out and they had dubbed Rich's voice into the film for the songs and let Koch lip sync them it would have been better. I always admired Rich's authenticity and his honest perspective on God's love for us and His acceptance of us just as we are. I had an opportunity to meet Rich at one of his concerts and took a photo with him. He died just a couple of years later. I still have it and it means a lot to me. I must say his music touched me deeply and drew me closer to the Lord. If anyone sees this movie, don't just look at the actors and the bad singing, Go out and buy some of Rich's music and hear the beauty and clearness of his faith. If you watch the movie, try to see the truth of life's journey and Rich's choice to write his feelings and struggles into songs, working through the pain of broken relationships, and experiencing the love of God.",1407888000,,1467,4.150877192982456

6290224,5,B00IRLISLM,"I loved Ragamuffin!
Decades ago I was at the lowest point in my life, when I accidentally turned on the local Christian Contemporary music station and heard ""Awesome God."" Even though I was a Christian, my life was a mess because I had made some really bad choices that ""I"" couldn't forgive. I thought God really hated me and was disgusted with me,  because I didn't measure up to others' expectations--others who constantly quoted scripture against me. I felt as though the world and my family would be better off if I wasn't around. But after hearing this song, I went shopping for a Rich Mullins tape instead of, well, ways to ""make the world a better place."" And I kept my radio on that station.
Rich's songs gave me hope that maybe God didn't really hate me and, hey, He might actually like me right here, right now, with everything that was wrong with me. And if God could forgive me, who did I think I was, refusing to forgive myself?
I think that was Rich's biggest message--and it comes through loud and clear in the movie. God loves you! You can hope in Him, and He'll take whatever you have to offer no matter how dirty and bruised, no matter what you look like, how you dress, or what you did last night or last year, or decades ago. And He will NEVER withdraw that love!  So years ago, I was finally able to pull down the curtains I had put up in the rut I was in. I left my baggage there, and started the slow climb toward the Light.
Every scene in this movie spoke to me.  Let's just say, my father wasn't the only family member or ""friend"" who rejected me.  Now that I see what Rich's life was like, I know I felt his pain  back then because it was my pain; so I was open to his message that ""Jesus loves me, this I know."" That's all I need to know, because God knows all the rest.
I am so grateful this movie was made, because there will always be a lot of people walking around with knives in their back, wondering if anyone could ever love them. And I want them to know that the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE loves them madly!",1407628800,,2039,4.217948717948718

At the same time, it wasn't very encouraging and did not show God's power to truly deliver, set free, love, and give a victorious life.  I know that none of us are perfect and we have and continue to struggle with things in our lives, but there is power in the name of Jesus.

The lyrics of his songs and the spirit in his voice as he sang wouldn't seem to indicate that. To be sure he seemed to be a man of passion and artistic genius but to portray him as constantly wallowing in darkness without any joy of his salvation was a shocker and difficult to imagine.

based on the life of Rich Mullins: Ragamuffin, DVD,  2013

We are not changed by the expectations of others, but by the love of God. Our Abba Father. Philippians 1:6-8, For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me. For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.

  I hope that I would leave a legacy of joy. A legacy of real compassion. Because I think there is great joy in real compassion. I don't think that you can know joy apart from caring deeply about people  caring enough about people that you actually do something.
  Rich Mullins, 1994

Based on the life of the late singer-songwriter Rich Mullins, the story is told as a radio interview, from Rich at a young age to his death, according to the remembrances of his family and friends. A real person, not glossed over, Rich talked about pursuing God not religion nor expectations of man. The one question becomes, ""Do you believe that I loved you?"" The movie portrayal conflicts with the words of his music, highlighting his character flaws. Quotations by Rich Mullins point to examination of where we place our focus ~ on God or man. His joy is not shown, nor a deeper acceptance he received being loved in brokenness. I liked the connection with Brennan Manning in the film, as a mentor with Rich. The lead actor does the singing and Rich's recordings are not used. Good visual clips of Rich interwoven with the credits.

The movie back cover does not contain a rating. There is cursing, smoking, and drinking portrayed in the film. Drama/biography, 137 minutes, co-produced by Rich Mullins' younger brother, Dave Mullins. DVD release date: July 8, 2014. The film seemed overly long in spots. Special features include the making of Ragamuffin, deleted scenes, audio commentary with David Schultz and Dave Mullins, and a message from Dave Mullins.

6290258,5,B00IRLISLM,"I loved this movie. It wasn't a candy-coated version of a Christian's life. Sometimes what you see on the outside isn't what's going on on the inside and not everyone's struggles are the same. As Christians we all have struggles and we fail on a daily basis, but what this movie pointed out is that God's love covers our failings. Rich Mullins was a very gifted man, and he shared his gift with the world. His walk through life may not have been considered ""Christian"" perfect by some people, but God knew his heart and that's all that matters.",1405382400,,544,4.505050505050505
6290259,5,B00IRLISLM,"The very first line felt like God punched me in the face...in a good way.  By the end my heart was aching with the fact that no matter how broken and tortured our souls may be, we are truly, deeply, undeniably loved by the Father.  The story spoke right to where I am at in life and the movie itself was done beautifully.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has been jaded by Christianity or is living in the belief that they can earn their way to Heaven.",1405382400,4,462,4.111111111111111
6290260,5,B00IRLISLM,Loved Loved Loved this movie! What a gift the man was and the many blessings he gave. I miss him. I miss his music. I miss his insights.,1405382400,,136,3.892857142857143
6290261,4,B00IRLISLM,"I loved getting to learn more about Rich Mullins. What a talented man. I've heard many stories about his radical faithfulness and authenticity; I thought this film captured some of that well. There was still a level of expected 'cheese' that comes with most explicitly Christian films, and oh how I wanted to pull the wig off of the actor playing Rich. But overall, a thoughtful biography of a beautiful ragamuffin.",1405382400,,415,4.859154929577465
6290262,5,B00IRLISLM,Touched my heart. He was a great example of a real Christian struggling with what life gave him.,1405296000,,96,4.388888888888889
6290263,4,B00IRLISLM,"I'm a long-time fan of Rich Mullins, and I've followed the production of this movie for the past four years.  I was thrilled when it all finally came together.  I waited for months to be able to see and drove two and a half hours to a church where it was showing.  As soon as the dvd came out, I had to have it.  The movie itself is not just a bio pic about one of my heroes, the late Rich Mullins, but it is a film about ""the reckless, raging fury that they call the love of God.""  There are some problems with the timing (and one recurring and obnoxious swinging light bulb scene that really needed to be cut or shaved down in the editing room), and I think they might not have struck a good balance of who Rich was--they played up his darker side and downplayed his lightheartedness.  I think the reason was to show how deeply he desired to be loved by his father and loved by God.  And I think that might be the message more people need to see. All in all, this is an independent Christian film that rises FAR above what I usually think of when I hear about independent Christian films.  I think most Christian films are pure CHEESE.  Ragamuffin is mostly substance and very little cheesiness (though there was a little that could have easily been avoided--the end sequence made me sigh).

Michael Koch did an amazing job of portraying Rich. He looked and sounded a lot like him, but beyond that I could tell he really studied for the part. He even had a lot of Mullins' mannerisms down pat (I compared him to some of the videos I have of Rich Mullins speaking--they were spot on). And I gotta give a shout out to Mitch McVicker--that dude did a phenomenal job of portraying himself.

If you're a Rich Mullins fan, or if you just want a movie that will make you think about life, love, and who God is and how He loves us--I strongly recommend Ragamuffin.  I'm a Ragamuffin, and I hope you are, too.  We're all just beggars at the door of God's mercy.",1405296000,2,1954,4.262872628726288
6290264,5,B00IRLISLM,"Good story, powerful message. I was familiar with some of the songs but had no idea of the author's life or struggles. Wish there were more people like Rich in the world.",1405296000,,170,4.34375
6290265,5,B00IRLISLM,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It wasn't perfect, but it was very deep and showed a side of Rich that I did not know about.  It made me feel like I wasn't alone in my problems and struggles.  If God can use Rich, he can use me because I have similar struggles like he did.  The movie had a lot of great symbolism that was very profound, in my opinion.  The most important thing, I think, is how this movie might bring people who believe that they are beyond the reach of Abba Father, to Himself.

  I have loved Rich, his music and his writings for decades and have attended many of his concerts.  My husband never saw Rich in concert and doesn't know very much about Rich, but he was the one who suggested we watch it a second and third time.  So many have relationship troubles, especially with fathers and my prayer is that this movie will strike a chord with someone and help them resolve some heavy burden they have been carrying for years.  Even greater is that most of us struggle with our relationship with our Heavenly Father and this movie just might help resolve some deep issues with Him as well.

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is open to being honest with themselves and realize that we're all ragamuffins and that Abba Father loves us not in spite of our sins, but with them.",1405296000,,1325,4.363265306122449

6290267,5,B00IRLISLM,I have listened to Rich Mullins songs for years but never knew his story till I watched this movie.  This is a awesome movie of his life story. So sad it ended so quickly.  I believe he wanted to find true love. A love he never felt from his father. Not quit sure of how God could love such a Ragamuffin. This is a movie I think all should see. I know it really touched me and kept my attention through the whole movie.,1405296000,,419,3.9761904761904763
6290268,5,B00IRLISLM,"Really my title says it all.

I met Rich Mullins when I was a teen back in the winter of 1983. He was the minister of music at a church in the suburbs of my home town and they were having a concert there our youth leader invited me to. Rich's insights were like nothing I'd ever heard from someone ""in the church"". What he said to me made sense - unlike a lot of what I heard from the church. Rich Mullins was real that night, and if this movie is any indication, he continued being that way until he was taken from us over a decade later.",1405296000,,539,3.944954128440367
6290269,5,B00IRLISLM,First I want to say I love Rich Mullins and his music.  I love how this movie depicted how he got the words to some of his more popular songs.  It makes his songs even more meaningful.  I wasn't aware of most of his dark and troubled past so this movie was very enlightening on why he seemed controversial and rebellious to some.  This is an excellent movie to see if you want to understand what withholding a father's love will do to a person.  I can only imagine what kind of man Rich would have been if his dad hadn't been so critical and unloving.  Made me want to rush home and hug and tell my kids how much I love them!  Overall great movie.,1405296000,,647,4.087301587301587

6290271,4,B00IRLISLM,"It was a good movie, the struggles of Rich were real.. I really wish it had shown some of his ""ups"" and not just his ""downs"".Some problems I had with this movie was  1.) Amy Grants character.. She didn't have straight perfect hair back than.. it was curly... and 2.) I cant figure out why one second Rich's hair was long, the next it was short all in the same time period... BUT besides all that.. The movie it self was a really good movie of his life// I didn't know he struggled with alcoholism and smoking...  so I learned alot about this mans life...",1405296000,,554,4.266666666666667
6290272,3,B00IRLISLM,"It was certainly insightful into the life of Rich Mullins. But this was supposed to be a movie about a man who called himself a Christian. I could have done without the cussing. Even if he did use that language, I didn't need to hear it in the movie.",1405123200,3,250,4.122448979591836
6290273,5,B00IRLISLM,"The world is sorely lacking in modern contemplatives, willing to be radical in their love for Christ. Regardless of whether this movie captures the actual man, it certainly conveys that spirit.",1405036800,,193,5.258064516129032
6290274,4,B00IRLISLM,"It would be remiss of me if I did not first admit this singer was unknown to me (call it a generation gap Folks!). However the trailer was so enticing I felt a pull and enlisted hubby's help (he first came to this country carrying a guitar on his back).

Based on the life of Rich Mullins, this is one of the most arresting movies of faith, love and charity I have seen to date.

Rich Mullins was a successful Contemporary Christian musician, known to Christians as the writer/singer of the worship anthem Awesome God"".
Influenced by St Francis of Assisi, Rich Mullins was a speaker on the power of God's love and the need for redemption, lived his faith every day of his life whilst facing his many demons.
Rising to the top of his profession, he eventually walked away from the pressures and lived on a Navajo reservation until his death in 1997.

I was however more interested in the actual person than the depressing portrayal presented by Michael Koch in RAGAMUFFIN.
Despite his struggles with substances and his bouts with despondency, Rich Mullins appeared to be someone you could not ignore. His vibrant personality made you think of your own faith and reminds us that we all come to God as ragamuffins.

This is one time where I would like to urge readers not to miss the special features, a must to understand the message. And speaking about the message behind the movie, Ragamuffin is certain to appeal to youths.
An excellent conversation opener, the movie of one man's struggle to live an honest faith in a materialist's society is well worth 4 stars!

6290275,5,B00IRLISLM,"Ragamuffin is based on the life of Rich Mullins. He wrote and sang many wonderful songs. His most famous in my eyes is his song Awesome God.
  This story is very, very interesting and at the same time very sad. He loved the Lord, but also fought against things that brought him down. He didn't feel loved and his Dad said things to him that really upset and hurt him throughout his life.
  I like how he never put people down, because he knew that God loves you even when you do something wrong. He also knew that God doesnt care if you don't wear a certain kind of clothes or your hair and bread weren't always in place.
  This DVD is 2  hours long and I just loved it all. It kept my interest all of the way through and made me realize even though people may be in music or singing and praising the Lord they may not always be happy or have a happy life.
  Very good, interesting DVD that I highly recommend. I know you would love to own it and watch it over and over.

6290276,5,B00IRLISLM,"This movie was different to say the least - but in a good way. I LOVED it!

At the beginning it seemed kind of like a documentary, but once it got into the actual story it was amazing. I hadn't heard of Rich Mullins prior to watching this, but I recognized a lot of his songs (some of my favorites even).

I highly recommend this movie - it was simply amazing.

6290277,4,B00IRLISLM,"I am familiar with Rich Mullins music, but did not know as much about the person. The film portrays a man who struggled with many issues, including tobacco, alcohol, depression, and his poor relationship with his father (excellently portrayed by Mel Fair). Although the movie does seem to be a bit darker than I would like since I have heard that he had a more whimsical side, and it is obvious that he cared greatly for others, especially troubled youth, but it did help me to understand him. His music shows a man who loves God whole-heartedly, but struggles with both the church and the trappings of fame. Yet, I also found myself able to empathize with some of the personal demons Rich faced as he pursued peace with himself and with God.

There were a few technical issues now and then (that I lack the knowledge to fully explain) and sometimes the time frame did not seem quite in accordance with reality of the age of the character, but it was a good overall look at Rich Mullins. The commentary tract (which gives the dvd Bonus Points from me, and added ones for the Closed Captioning!) with director David Shultz and Rich's brother, Dave (who plays a DJ interviewing Rich), explained that the story was meant to be of more how Rich would have viewed events in his life, plus some characters and stories were put in different sequence or a character would be the compilation of more than one of the people in Rich's life. Understandable. Loved the music, but I was a little surprised to learn that the singing in the film was actually done by lead actor, Michael Kohl, instead of using Rich's voice. However, it works.

6290278,5,B00IRLISLM,"In the world of rising music stars and American Idols, I believe we fail to see the real people hidden behind the record labels and recording studios. The people who exist when all the lights and cameras are gone home for the night. When they are simply all alone with their thoughts. We don't always see the real people, the brutally honest insight into what goes on and what they are really feeling on the inside.

In the DVD Ragamuffin, which chronicles the life of Rich Mullins, you get to see past all the glitz and publicity to watch the rise of what it took back in the late 70s to gain the notoriety we see in our music artists today. Yet the one thing that sticks with you is the honesty in his life. Raised as a farmer who didn't quite possess the skills necessary to gain success in the eyes of his father, Rich gravitated to music in which he excelled naturally. Unfortunately he was seen as less than worthy in the eyes of his own father, which made understanding the love of God difficult. If God loves you, you should believe it. When Rich looked at that model in his own life no matter how many people told him that his real dad loved him, he found that faith hard to swallow.

Throughout the movie, however, Rich never losses his honest faith with connecting with the God of the Bible. His faith is genuine and the messages he shared when playing his music in churches connected with people on a level I don't think many can achieve even now. He wasn't looking for fame, wealthy or success. He simply was looking for a place to call home. He found it briefly when he met a girl named Jess, who provided him that unconditional love, we all need to feel a part of something bigger. But when Nashville called wanting to record his songs for artists like Amy Grant, Jess gracefully bowed out, even though Rich declined to go. She knew he was destined for more and the struggles he makes to find his way in the world, I think everyone can relate to.

I received Ragamuffin compliments of Millennium Entertainment and Flyby Promotions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed in this review are strictly my own. There are simply too many good things to say about this movie but most of all is that God is genuine and He is real. The story of Rich's life shows how desperately he wanted that connection he had with God to be manifested in human form. He shares how difficult and lonely life can be at times, and I think that hits home with so many. Our lives at times have their moments when we can simply feel all alone and wondering if our one life makes any difference at all. This story of Rich's showcases just how one life can impact and cause the ripples that span long after they begin and I believe that is the message behind it all. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion.",1404777600,,2884,4.346938775510204
6290279,5,B00IRLISLM,"About the DVD:

 'Ragamuffin' is based on the life of Rich Mullins, a musical prodigy who rose to Christian music fame and fortune only to walk away and live on a Navajo reservation. An artistic genius, raised on a tree farm in Indiana by a callous father, Rich wrestled all of his life with the brokenness and crippling insecurity born of his childhood. A lover of Jesus and a rebel in the church, Rich refused to let his struggles with his own darkness tear him away from a God he was determined to love. As he struggled with success in Nashville and depression in Wichita, Rich desired most of all to live a life of honest and reckless faith amidst a culture of religion and conformity.

About Rich Mullins:

 Singer and songwriter Richard Wayne Rich Mullins was best known for his worship song Awesome God which has been embraced as a modern classic by many Christians. His music has been covered by many artists, including Caedmons Call, Amy Grant, Jars of Clay, Michael W. Smith, Third Day, John Tesh, and Hillsong United. Mullins musical career formally began with Zion Ministries in the late 1970s, where he wrote music and performed with a band called Zion.  Mullins first solo hit, Awesome God, appeared on his third album and brought his music to a wider audience. Rich Mullins was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Gospel Music Association (GMA) on April 29, 2014.

My Review:

 Rich Mullins is a world renowned contemporary music artist that has shown us through his loving words how awesome our God is. With his sheer will, determination and God's almighty power he has been catapulted to where he stands today. With the odds stacked against him God was able to help Him reach his destiny. Ragamuffin, is a film based on his life and his miraculous turn around when it came to going along with God instead of against Him. A very powerful message!

 Being the broken man he was, he still moved on to reach greatness in the eyes of many. As a result of a rocky childhood and relationship with his father he struggled within himself to find love in his heart for Rich. And that is what this story is all about, that in spite of the uncertainties he still kept clinging to God. A film that can change lives is what this film has become and I can definitely see why. Too many times we listen to Satan's lies about ourselves and we must never forget that we are children of God and we need to always stay close by his side. Because if we do, we will reach heights way beyond our wildest dreams.

I have listened to Rich Mullins music for two decades, read all of his published writings, watched interviews, concerts, etc.  I was looking forward to really enjoying this movie.  It was awful, the darkness, the bad relationship with his father, the angst.  Rich's music was about loving God and the love of God, it was about the majesty and magnificence of God, his songs were his message to the world, this movie makes him out to be some skid row Howard Hughes wannabe.

6290281,5,B00IRLISLM,"""Ragamuffins are the unsung assembly of saved sinners who are little in their own sight, conscious of their brokenness... and who cast themselves on His Mercy."" ~ Brennan Manning

I can't attest to how true this movie is to Rich Mullins as he was on earth. I know him through his music and his words, not yet in person. (Though Rich is one of the reasons I am so delighted about my Grandmother recently going to heaven. She's there face to face with God Himself, and with Rich Mullins and others like him. How she could not rejoice for all eternity?)
What I can say is that Ragamuffin captured a man of intensity, passion and pain, with the desire to know and be known, to love and be loved, and a man who kept calling out to a God who heard Him.

I think all that is at the heart of Rich's songs, and it is the heart of this film.

Michael Koch, the actor who plays Rich, did so well. From watching multiple Youtube concert archives, I recognized some of Rich's mannerisms in Michael. While no one can ever duplicate that beautiful ""Rich grin"" that would flash across his face, Michael did a very fine job.

I love that Rich's songs were treated so respectfully and came across so real.
At several points when Michael was performing, I thought they must have been using real Rich audio.
Elijah, Doubly Good To You, Verge of a Miracle, Awesome God, Hold Me Jesus, We Are Not as Strong, and Be with You are all here, in whole or in part, all sung powerfully and quietly. That truly made this movie a keeper.
You could feel bits of the emotion that Rich may have felt, radiating out of the actor to the viewers, as he gave those words to the world.

Michael also conveys Rich's affection for his Jeep, his affinity for running around barefoot, and his proclivity for stopping mid-concert and shocking everybody with a well timed piece of wisdom so obvious that we'd all managed to miss it.

His epic quote is here, smack in the middle of this film. ""Christianity is not about building an absolutely secure little niche in the world where you can live with your perfect little wife and your perfect little children in your beautiful little house where you have no gays or minority groups anywhere near you. Christianity is about learning to love like Jesus loved and Jesus loved the poor and Jesus loved the broken.

The holes in his jeans were here too... and the white v-neck T shirt that you see in so many 1990's concerts. And his habit of giving folks the shirt off his back, and of borrowing clothes from other people.
(There's a great story in the Homeless Man interviews where he borrowed one friend's boots, in Ireland, wore them home, to America, and then gave them away!)

They even recreated a ""let's make it rain"" scene! Again, I've watched him do that on Youtube and it's the coolest thing.

Although I've heard that the section with ""Jess"" is highly fictionalized, I love that it gave them room to talk about longing and loneliness- two things that permeate his music. It was incredible the first time I heard him talk about how we'll probably always be lonely inside. Early on Jess confesses a frightening inner loneliness, and he takes her hand in his, looks at their joined hands for a moment, and says ""Even when you're as close as you can be to another human- even when you're touching- you feel lonely now.""
She couldn't say that she didn't.

I also think they brought his honesty and authenticity to life well. At one point a friend asks him if he's ""Doing ok"" and he says ""Not really. I've been drinking again a lot and hating myself for it.""

I also once heard someone say ""Rich hated to be alone, so he created community everywhere.""
He craved the presence of friends. And he was honest about that too. In our disconnected world, we'd be considered some kind of freaky codependent if we admitted how much we needed/wanted people, if we told them how much they really helped us, if we told them how glad we were that they existed and how worried we were that they would stop caring about us and drop out of out lives. Yet wouldn't it make the world a better place if we would say it all?

When he was young, they portray Rich as wanting to feel real, to feel close to God. To feel loved. As he grows, he begins to depend less on feelings, to trust that God's Love wouldn't ever leave.

And that's one certain thing: God loves Rich Mullins.

""Getting it"" or grasping at answers in the dark~ Whole or broken.
And Rich gave us so much.

6290282,5,B00IRLISLM,"I loved this movie. It gave Rich Mullins back to those of us who loved him just like he was. Talanted, untamable except by an untamable God, so not of this world he didn't even know how much money he earned. His inspired music changed the way we think of a Holy God. Rich loved the God he believed wants nothing more than to meet us where we are and love us in return.",1404259200,,368,3.9864864864864864
6290283,5,B00IRLISLM,"I expected to watch a movie about a Christian singer who refused to conform to the CCM culture.  However, this movie blew me away.  I had no idea that Rich Mullins had so many demons in his closet and that it took most of his life to find peace and to begin conquering his addiction.  My one regret in the movie is that the actor did not have the same countenance as the real man; Rich Mullins always seemed to have such a peace to him, in everything I have seen him in.  That being said, I still feel that Michael Koch did an excellent job and performed Rich's music beautifully.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to have a deeper level of faith and to walk through Rich's struggles as best as we can understand them.  I have been blessed to get to know this man, Rich Mullins, a little better and I am challenge to read more about his life.",1404086400,,853,4.170731707317073

I wish they had gotten more into the details of his life - like how he was so forgetful to return coffee cups, he has a collection of them in the back of his truck and when asked about it said something like ""all things are made by God and to be shared by his people.""

6290285,4,B00IRLISLM,"Ragamuffin is based off the life of Rich Mullins, who was a very talented Christian singer and song writer.  Although the title is unusual, it symbolizes the burdened, the wobbly and weak-kneed, the inconsistent, unsteady disciples... the smart people who know they are stupid... the honest disciples who admit they are scalawags*.  Rich Mullins was a little rough around the edges but he was clearly gifted, humble and on fire for God.  This movie depicts him in an honest light and shows him struggling with loving his father, drinking and cussing.  Because of this portrayal, I don't recommend this movie for young children.

The visuals are definitely low budget; they were going for the indie/ragamuffin look. (They succeeded.)  The story however is great and the musical talent of Michael Koch who portrays Rich is top notch.  If you're a fan of Rich Mullins and his music (Awesome God, Creed, Elijah) I highly recommend checking this movie out.",1403913600,2,951,5.019108280254777
6290286,3,B00IRLISLM,In an effort to be honest and show the true struggles of Rich Mullins this film is not balanced and shows much too much of the darkness in Rich's life.  There should have been more of Rich's humor and love for people shown in this film.  Rich was a testimony for the love of Christ and that does not show through and leaves one unsatisfied and depressed.  I am surprised since I have read that Rich's brother had played a role in the way Rich's life would be revealed in the making of this film.  I understand the reasons for showing the dark side of Rich but the light was lost in the darkness. leaving one rather depressed for having sat through the movie.,1403481600,28,658,4.282258064516129

Who I encountered was not some famous guy up there on a pedestal, but a mega talented man who was raw and honest, and loved God. It touched deep down in me to the little girl who just wanted her daddy's love & approval. This is a movie as much about God's amazing Grace and Love, as it is about Richard Mullins. (Maybe more so) Very nicely done. Great acting, and some very nice singing by Michael Koch. This is one I could (and will) watch again and again.",1403222400,,524,4.25

6290289,4,B00IRLISLM,"I didn't really start listening to Rich Mullins until The World as Best as I Remember It. Then suddenly I discovered I had a strange addiction to replaying these two albums (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2). I found myself lost in both his musical nuances as well as his lyrical poetry. And of particular note his delight in God's glory showing itself in Earth's simple yet beautiful nature rang both simplistic and delightful. As Rich released more albums I took note that he was really quite distracted by the blessedness of being broken man before a loving Abba father. The whole ""ragamuffin"" theme that showed up multiple albums strong with him and his ""ragamuffin band"" had me scratching my head, but eventually I studied the CD inserts and the lyrics and made some limited sense of it. This movie apparently aims to clarify. Rich was apparently a profoundly broken individual. And it's in that brokenness that God's love is found to be so profound.

What did I think of the movie? For the most part, it was what I expected it to be, based on the trailers and the other comments. I say ""for the most part"" because there were some surprises, most of which were a little disappointing. First of all I felt that the story was just painfully depressing. It was as if Rich had no sense of Spirit-given joy in his life whatsoever. But I know that's not true. I think this movie represented only one side of Rich that honestly paints an incomplete picture of how a real ""hero""--a broken Christian--comes to fully discover and know and richly understand the wonder of God's love. For being about 30 minutes too long I felt, it seemed disappointing that Rich's problems and emotional pain took 90% of the movie.

I also had some frustrations with some of the technical issues. Being an amateur/hobbyist video editor, I noticed some bizarre warp stabilizer warping going on as soon as the movie began. There were also some darkly lit scenes that frankly should have been fully lit and made darker in post, or else use some other cameras. As characters moved around the screen in these dark scenes they'd leave a ghost trail almost like 80s VHS and CRT. This had me really surprised when I saw the ""making of"" video show them using Red cameras.

The acting was good, though. Not amazing. This is not a Hollylwood blockbuster movie with Hollywood greats on the set. But for a budget film, the acting was solid.

And for the most part, the story was solid, too. It made its point(s) well enough. There were a couple deleted scenes I'm not sure should have been deleted, but if you do buy this DVD you should watch the deleted scenes, that's all I can say. Overall, this is a very good story with a very good message that imperfect, broken people can relate to. And for once, this movie shows hope for the brokenness. Death in the end comes across like triumph. But then again, that's only because I know the backstory, and listened to the whole ""When I go I want to go out like Elijah"" song. Those who don't know, might miss it, and grieve in the end instead of celebrate.",1402876800,,3050,4.550091074681238

6290291,4,B00IRLISLM,This movie allowed me to take a peek into Rich Mullins life and his inner struggles.  I was able to attend one of his concerts in a small church in Manchester New Hampshire in the early 90's.  He was  really good and I became a fan of his.

6290294,1,B00IRLISLM,"I guess I'll be the first to give this a 1-star review.
Looking at many of the reviews for this film they appear to be giving their 4 and 5 star thumbs up to Rich Mullins. That's fine. Rich Mullins was a dynamic individual who produced some really powerful music and verse over his too-short career as a singer-songwriter.
I'm not going to review Rich Mullins here. I'm going to review the film.
""Ragamuffin"" has all of the hallmarks of being a low-budget film. The dialog is fairly stiff and so are the actors delivering that dialog. This running trend in ""Christian"" filmmaking drives me nuts and we've seen it in films like ""Fireproof"", ""Courageous"", and to a lesser extent ""Grace Unplugged."" A group of Christians get together to make a movie with very little in the way of budget and very few experienced actors. The movie still becomes a minor ""hit"" because of the number of Christians willing to purchase and consume the latest ""Jesus Junk"" from their local ""Christian"" bookstore.
The episodic storytelling in this film delivers little in the way of a coherent plot and zero in the way of plot resolution. The key theme seems to be the strained relationship between Rich and his father which is never resolved to any satisfaction. Yes... Rich does write himself a letter as though it were written by his deceased father but that little bit of therapy is just a fiction. His father never actually wrote those words. Maybe that really happened and maybe that really made Rich feel better but it struck me as little more than Rich pulling a con job on himself.
That little letter-writing scene also introduced the one vivid image in the movie that for me defines this film. That's the image of a single amber light bulb swinging back and forth across the screen as Rich confronts the demon that is his relationship with his father. It's such a cliche image that the They Might Be Giants/Homestar Runner music video ""Experimental Film"" uses that exact same motif. That was the facepalm moment for me.
Personally I'll stick to the documentary film about Rich Mullins titled ""Homeless Man"". Perhaps that film was produced too soon after his death and doesn't deal with the darker side of Rich's life like ""Ragamuffin"" does but it is much more coherent.",1401408000,18,2253,4.735368956743002
6290295,5,B00IRLISLM,"This is the story of Rich Mullins, a Ragamuffin Christian who encountered the full ""reckless, raging fury that they call the Love of God.""  The movie may show too much of his dark side, but they do that to make a point.  I never met Rich personally when he was alive, though I felt I knew him to some extent.  God used Rich in my life in miraculous ways so many times.  God used Rich in so many people's lives.  This movie doesn't change how I feel about him at all.  It does change a bit of my perception of him, but not how I feel about him.  I wonder how much of an accurate portrayal of who he was this movie is.  I don't think it's supposed to be that.
Michael Koch is not Rich Mullins - not by a long shot.  I have advised people to keep a picture of Rich at hand while watching the movie so that they can visualize him doing and saying the things in the movie.
I very highly recommend this movie, but I advise you keep in mind that this is not a story of who Rich Mullins was, it is a story of his struggles as a Ragamuffin Christian and coming face to face with the Love of God.",1401235200,2,1086,3.944954128440367

6290299,4,B00IRLISLM,"Im going to get the bad out of the way. If you're hoping this movie solves all the problems of the so-called Christian movie industry, it does not. It is too long by at least a half-hour, we never feel like the main character really is Mullins until almost a half-hour into the film, and it seems preachier than it needs to be, often using way too much dialog to communicate messages that filmmakers should be able to make with far less talking and far more skillful directing, acting and editing. Anachronisms abound for those who look for them (certain musical equipment and instruments appear years and years before they actually were available), the lighting seems to be an afterthought, and in many cases (as I implied earlier) paragraphs of dialog abound where lines would do.

If you think this movie is just as bad as so many Christian films (virtually all that I have seen in fact) are, youd also be wrong. Refreshingly, this film does not sanitize the smoking, drinking, cussing (okay, maybe it eases up on the cussing, Im okay with that), broken character that Rich apparently was. That, I found refreshing. And when Michael Koch finally finds the main character (or should I say, when we finally believe in him and the director finally sets the character free), he carries it well, warts (and there are many) and all. I was impressed with how Koch sings and plays the part so well (using his own voice by the way), too, right down to the occasional sloppy piano and idiosyncratic vocal stylings. The stress of growing up with such a broken father-son relationship plays a major role, as it should, and explains much of what we need to know about the character (reminded me of Johnny Cash, actually).

I was fortunate enough to meet Mullins during his too-short life, about 7 years before his death. By meet, I don't mean shake hands after a concert, but in fact along with a small group of folks got to spend hours and hours with him talking and really getting to know each other. He was, by far, the most interesting person I have ever met. So I am a little biased in saying that beyond the flaws in this film (again, typical of so many Christian movies, and of so much Christian music for that matter), is the story of a man who was worth knowing and knowing about, not in spite of, but partly because of his flaws. I can probably count on one hand the number of Christian songwriters who come close to Mullins talent and transparency (even if Im missing a finger or two), and Im thrilled that this film might introduce some new people to his work. Even more, maybe more people will come to grips with the fact that Jesus not only doesnt mind their brokenness, but loves them right in the middle of it all.

That would thrill Rich the most.",1400803200,3,2754,4.526104417670683
6290300,5,B00IRLISLM,"It has been one week since I have seen the film and I still have a Ragamuffin hangover. The spirit of the film is so deep that it is clearly more of a God story than a Rich story. Since last Wednesday night I have been reading my bible more, been seeking the Holy Spirit more in my day to day activities, and been focusing so much more on Gods love for me. I want to know, before I meet Him, and believe that He loved me. I want to act like I believe and know He loves me. Those are even the passages I am currently seeking out right now, those and the ones of being fearless in Himand this is all due to watching the movie, while sitting on a bar stool and drinking vitamin water last Wednesday.

David, thank you for making the film. I know thousands of us want to know more about the man who wrote that music and those lyrics, but the spiritual residue from the Creator of the man who wrote that music and those lyrics is going to impact the audience far more than Richs story. It is really a God story. Thank you.",1400371200,6,1017,4.034653465346534
6290301,4,B00IRLISLM,"I will review the movie, but I have to share a story first. Bear with me.

I was getting ready for church Sunday morning, September 20, 1997, when my sister burst into my room and yelled, ""Rich Mullins was killed in a car crash!"" I stared at her. ""That's not funny,"" I said flatly. ""No, really, it's on the radio!"" And then she saw my face and realized that might not have been the best way to break the news to me, considering what a fan I was. So she left my room.
Getting through church that morning was hard, because I wanted to grieve, but I also had a lot of guilt. I'm at church to focus on God, not cry over some singer that I didn't even know that died. I'd been taught/told that the interests I had (movies, music, etc) were silly, trivial, dumb, what have you, and it would be wrong to cry over him. But I wanted to, because he was more than ""some singer"" to me. When the congregation recited The Apostle's Creed, I could only say it in my head, not out loud, because all I could hear was Rich singing, ""I believe what I believe/Is what makes me what I am"". And I thought, ""Are you singing your song with the angels today, Rich?""
Finally service let out, I got in the car with my sister, and I sobbed and sobbed. I finally calmed down enough to start the car, and of course the Christian radio station was playing Rich's music. The song, ""All the Way My Savior Leads Me"" (words not by him, but his arrangement and recording) just finished, and the DJ said, ""If some of you are having a hard time dealing with this tragedy, there's a book you can read called 'Why Bad Things Happen To Good People'.""
I shut off the radio and started swearing and yelling at it. There's a line in the movie ""Galaxy Quest"", you'd have to see it to understand, but one of the characters says, ""Did any of you ever WATCH the show???"" And that's what I was yelling at the radio. Did you ever LISTEN to his songs?? Did you ever pay attention to what he SAID??? Bad thing? He went out like Elijah! He went Home. He's not Waiting anymore (those are all titles of songs he sang). He sang, ""I'll call you my country/But I'll be lonely for my home."" He said, ""Someday I'll be like those stained glass windows"", like the saints they represented. If you actually loved him and his music you would of course be hurting to lose him, but a bad thing for HIM??? No way, he's the lucky one. We're the poor saps that still haven't seen glory yet.

That's my thought when I read people's comments about this movie, saying they're disappointed in how it shows Rich. I don't think they were paying attention. Although, it does help to realize that this is not a straight biopic of him. This is not meant to be a straight, ""So here's Rich Mullins and here's what he was like"". Of course, again, if you were paying attention, you'd realize what an impossible feat that would be! Not to mention, you have to have an understanding of movie writing and movie making. Scriptwriters have to pick a story to tell. And my feeling is, the makers of this film picked the right story. I also would suggest to anyone who hasn't seen it, read reviews, both good and bad, and watch the documentary made of the film (available at [...]). This will help prepare you for what you will see. If you want to learn about all the sides of Rich, google him on YouTube and watch ""Homeless Man"", the first documentary done about him many years ago, and then watch as many concerts and clips as you can. You'll see all his goofiness and seriousness and profoundness and talent. Then watch this movie.

The movie decided choose a story that seemed to drive a lot of Rich's struggles through his life: his relationship with his father. By his own admission (again, if you listened) it was rocky. He wasn't into sports and was not mechanically minded, and his dad was all GUY and a farmer to boot, so he always struggled to believe that his dad really loved him. This created a dichotomy in his personality--the desire to be accepted and loved, and the desire to act in ways that really put that to the test. This is a story that so many can relate to. The film shows how this affected his music, his love life (Rich said he was engaged/with a woman for 10 years and it ended with her marrying someone else), his friendships, and his behaviors. He struggled with addictions and codependency, and the film shows that. But it shows also that, even in the midst of his sins and problems, he cried out to God, mostly through his music. As one of his bandmates once said of him, ""His appetite for sin was greater than mine"", but then so was his appetite for God. His producer, Reed Arvin (who is not depicted in the film), once said that he felt like Rich was boxing with God in his lyrics, and he felt like he shouldn't be in the studio when Rich was recording, because it was a private conversation. In showing all this, the film easily could have accidentally crossed a line and shown too much to make Rich out to be a hypocrite. But it pulls back just in time to show exactly what I said--Rich didn't preach at people or condemn people for the things they did, because he did them himself. Instead he shared how imperfect he was, and yet still wrote and sang about God, not for other people, but for himself (there's even a concert scene in the movie in which he says, before singing, ""This is more for me than for you"", talking to his audience).

On the one hand the scriptwriter had a heck of a time trying to tell this story, and I think it was a job well done. On the other hand there wasn't a ton of writing to do since a lot of Rich's narration in the film are straight quotes from him. :D (I'm not putting her down, really, I'm being tongue in cheek here) But seriously, in the movie, almost everything Rich says in his concerts and in his interview (the story is told through a radio interview he's doing, and the interviewer is played by Rich's real life brother, David Mullins) in the film are straight quotes from his concerts and writings. I know that because I'm a geeky enough fan to have read and listened to everything there is out there. :P While the timeline of events and songs and quotes are not ""historically"" accurate, that hardly matters in the telling of the story, at least I don't think so. And once again, I'm just geeky enough to KNOW it's not historically accurate. If you're not like me, you won't know the difference (which is why I don't think it matters). The only thing that bothered me in that regard was the song Rich is shown to be recording shortly before he died (it's from his first album, it was not what he was working on before his death). Still, I think it was chosen for storytelling reasons, so I can let that go.

Now, why isn't it 5 stars? Simply technical things, if we may detach emotionally from this for a second. There should have been more of an effort to show Rich aging. The actor, Michael Koch, did an amazing job portraying Rich as he's written in the script. However, he looks exactly the same in the film in 1975 as he does in 1997, just before he's killed. That is perhaps a budget issue (I don't think it's a talent issue), but it's still something you just have to sort of ""buy"" when you watch it. There's also his hair--it seems to change length and appearance from scene to scene sometimes, and there's not always a time gap. I do think there were some short sequences that could have been cut out, not for content but for time--it's been commented that the film feels flabby in places, too much padding. I agree (my husband does not, he thinks it makes it awkward and that it needed to be awkward to emphasize Rich's story). I also think that maybe his codependency was a little overplayed. Only because I know (well, as a fan, I THINK I know) that certain relationships were not severed as a result, particularly with ""Justin"" (his name in the film, though fans know it's representing Beaker). Rich even later wrote a song for Beaker's son so we know they stayed friends. But the film shows it as a bridge was sadly burned. So, the only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the technical aspect, and some minor personal issues.

I will say though, that as someone who DOES NOT LIKE Christian films, mostly for the cheesy 2 dimensional acting/characterization that is the norm, that this movie is great. The acting is not 2D. There are places where I felt like it was so natural, that I was watching real people have a real conversation. Some people might think that looks like bad acting, but I thought the opposite. I especially loved the interactions with Morris, his roommate's dad (played by the real life roommate himself, which was impactful for me). He's not a professional actor, I don't think, and so he was very real. The only actors I'd have a problem with were minor, people like the fundamentalist pastor, or the president of the college Rich goes to. Everyone else was very real and relaxed and believable.

If you DO like Christian films, though, be warned you may not like this because of how real it is. Christian films pretend to deal in real, but they end up staying on the surface. As David Mullins says in a brief interview on the DVD of this movie, we even try to whitewash stories in the Bible, even when it's not a children's Sunday school class. The heroes in the Bible ""made mistakes"" but didn't sin, the way we tell it. That's just not true though. David sinned huge, Moses sinned and lost the promised land, Abraham lied and was a bad dad, Gideon set up idols after he won the battle against the Midianites. This movie doesn't stay on the surface. So if you're easily offended by the sins of others, don't watch it. And in all seriousness, do not show this to your young children unless you have a talk with them first--there is drinking, smoking, and mild curse words.

But that's who Rich was. And if you were paying attention, if you really listened to him, you'd know that if his story was told at all, this is how it should be told. Because in the end, the movie is all about Christ and HIS perfection. Because He's the only Hero anyone of us should look to. The rest of us are Ragamuffins.",1400371200,198,10131,4.365129835718071

As one who has been deeply touched by his music for years, I was so happy to finally see a story about his life. I highly recommend it.

I loved it and will be purchasing it for gifts for family members this year (shh....dont tell!) : )",1400025600,40,382,4.656716417910448
6290307,5,B00IRLISLM,"From what I have heard, you never saw a fake Rich Mullins, but there was a stage real and an everyday real in that he didn't see need to portray all of his demons on stage; but demons he had, and in the end, he was still loved by Jesus.  He had trouble understanding that, but so should we all, in a way.  The movie is raw.  It isn't the typical ""Christian"" movie with pretty bows at the end.  It is about a life that continues to influence people seventeen years later through the music, the writings, and the memories he left behind.",1400025600,11,535,4.165048543689321

8644802,5,B00IRLISLM,"Moving biographical movie about one of my favorite singers, Rich Mullens.  Seeing his story showed me why I identify so deeply with his music.  A fellow Ragamuffic, Rich struggled to come to terms with the furious, uncompromising love of God.  Our human condition hinders us from the truth of God's love, but embracing the struggle is the path of every true believer, every Ragamuffin who accepts what we are unworthy, but God loves us anyways.  I have seen this at least a dozen times and have not grown tired of it. I highly recommend it, especially if you struggle to fully believe that God could love you.  I also recommend the Ragamuffin Gospel by Brennan Manning, a book that brilliantly articulates the struggle to bridge the gap between our hearts and eternity.",1524355200,,769,4.795454545454546

8644806,2,B00IRLISLM,"I had high hopes for this movie but was disappointed. It was disjointed, didn't feel real, and as the viewer it didn't seem that I got to know who the real Rich Mullins was. I know he was flawed, I get that. But if this film is all I knew about him, I don't think I'd be inspired to learn more. I know I'm going against what a lot of reviewers are calling a great movie, but to me, this is a missed opportunity to share an amazing story about a complicated man whose music and real life struggles inspired so many of us.",1521244800,,520,4.009615384615385
