8411940,5,B004047XV6,This series is one of my favorites it has humor action and romance packed in to one i really like the fight scenes they look fluid and amazing and it really proves how much effort aniplex put in production value if u guys aren't convinced check it out for your selves but i only have one complaint right when it ends it leaves stuff unlresolved i kind of expected a season 3 i really to see a season 3 the only thing we can do is support it so eventually they could broadcast it in japan and funimation can release it in the process.,1321833600,,533,4.134615384615385
8411941,5,B004047XV6,"I thought the first season was alright. I liked the characters just wasn't into the story so much. More so because it didn't reveal too much about the main character. Then season 2 and BAM! They really turn up the heat. This one takes away all the goofiness and gets deadly serious. If you can't tell by Birdy's expression on the box cover you're in for some stuff with this one.

This season focuses more on Birdy and her past. It's amazing how they switched up the the story from season 1. which was so light hearted. I heard they don't plan to make a Season 3 I really hope that was a joke. This is def an anime I could watch for 100+ episodes. Way too good to be only 2 seasons!",1305590400,,682,4.12781954887218

8411943,5,B004047XV6,Birdy the mighty season 2 picks up not long after season 1.  Part of the city is still a disaster zone from the destruction caused in the final episode of season 1 and Birdy has the free time to go back to her pop star disguise.  When a jail break happens in space the criminals retreat to earth and disguise themselves among the humans.  Birdy is given a new assignment to round up the crooks. Too bad for the crooks that while Birdy merely wants to arrest them one of Birdy's childhood friends is plotting to kill the crooks off one by one. Its a race on who will get them first.  If Birdy's problems weren't enough she also finds her brain slowly being over written and taken over by the human boy sharing her body.  A problem that will take us into Birdy's memories and her past growing up to become the officer she is today. Even learning how she got her nickname.,1297555200,,869,4.274390243902439
8411944,5,B004047XV6,"This is simply one of the best well rounded sci fi anime to come out in a long time; bar none. There is no need for a 3rd season if you watch carefully. This show is full of cinematic surprises and brilliant storytelling that gives the right amount of clues to involve the viewer. If anything, a 3rd season would be great to continue the adventures of the characters, but the way it leaves at the end of the 26th episode, if you thought it through and piece together the plentiful clues all laid out in 15-26, you will know why and you'll be more than satisfied with the story.",1294185600,,577,4.254545454545455
8411945,5,B004047XV6,"My favorite anime in a long time.

Though it was overlooked by the North American anime fandom at large, Birdy The Mighty Decode was one of the all around best series of the last five years.  Think of a high-minded crime drama set in a fantastically realized version of Tokyo spliced with elements of an intriguing space opera, and played out by a cast of sympathetic characters who could just as easily have stepped out of the pages of a Marvel comic or off of a city bus, and drawn in the most fluid and kinetic style you could imagine.  I can't praise or recommend this series highly enough.

The animation is simply gorgeous, fluid, and has a wonderful pastel colour scheme.  The characters are well rounded, and the world they live in is full of nuance.  That's probably to best thing about this show, the fantastic world-building outside of the main plot.",1292198400,,861,4.594771241830065
8411946,3,B004047XV6,"This is a beautiful show, the animation is solid, and the art is very consistent. Though I have 2 complaints.

1)While the story is very interesting there is a lot of stuff unanswered. It seems like they intended to do a 3rd season. Unfortunately the sales of this show in Japan were very lackluster, so the chances of a follow up are quite slim. The show kind of leaves you with a sense that nothing was accomplished.

2)The last episode of this show has a kanji credits scroll while concluding with dialog. It seems Funimation was not able to obtain a clean portion of this episode. So instead of rolling their credits at the end of the episode like most anime publishers practice now days, they actually shrink the screen in a tiny box and roll their credits beside it. This is very annoying and in very bad taste. If you do not watch dubs, and enjoy subtitled anime like myself, It's very annoying to read what they are saying. In the future I hope practices like this are not repeated.

Overall I did enjoy this show but I cannot recommend It, as It is not a complete package.",1291507200,,1081,4.422110552763819
8411947,4,B004047XV6,"Birdy the Mighty: Decode, season 2 is a truly great anime Sci-Fi series that excels in just about everything - plot, animation, audio, and action. Basically it's a series that would be the result of combining Men in Black, Wonder woman, and Blade Runner. You can find all kinds of information of what the series is about elsewhere, so this will be a review of the Funimation release, which is what it should be about. I received my copy in on Friday 11/12.

Watching Funimation's DVD set of season 2 was the second time through the season, and it still was as good as watching the first time through. Visually the DVD is mastered well with the video having good resolution, color, and motion handling. The audio is well done too, though only output in stereo with Japanese w/English subtitles. The only thing that has been mentioned on forums is the ending for each episode has had English credits imposed over the original video, with the video image resized like a picture in picture view, sitting over in the top left corner. Personally it's not a big deal to me, the episode closing/openings get in the way of going through a series - I almost always skip right to the episode beginning for anime series. I do like the second season opening very much; Content of the disc is just Birdy the Mighty Decode episodes on both discs with Funimation trailers in addition on the second disc. No clean OP/ED or other additional bonus items.

Overall, this is a solid release for visual and audio quality. My personal opinion is the English track takes away too much from the series, it just doesn't feel like you are watching the same show. Birdy the Mighty: Decode (both seasons) is one of my favorite anime series; you can really connect with what the characters are going through. It would only be better being released on Blu-Ray (properly - not a release like Funimation's status quo upscales.)

Edit: FYI, The OVA Cipher episode is included in this set as Episode 26. It is highly recommended you watch Episode 26 before watching 14-25.",1289606400,7,2037,4.6685236768802225
