There is not much narration, just creative, ethereal music and fun sound effects. My children adored it when they were toddlers, but now they think there is no point in watching this movie with ""no talking"". I was introduced to this movie by a teacher friend and I still love it no matter how many times I watch it.

from the age of 2 on, he was always willing to sit with nana, snuggle and watch this quiet miracle of a movie.  and he still does, but now HE
asks for it!

2443231,5,B000BVN0ZA,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. The pencil sketches are not what you see in modern animation. This is completely old school. And, the introduction from a well known 80s singer is something parents will enjoy.

I am so excited my 6 year old also loves it. We own a DVD, but its so convenient to get an amazon copy so we can download it to a tablet and watch in the car or elsewhere. The basic premise is that a kid builds a snowman in a huge snowfall then it come to life and takes him on an adventure. Its entirely done to music and no words except one song has a vocal solo during the video. Its great for young kids and old kids alike.",1471392000,,650,3.9618320610687023

2443258,5,B000BVN0ZA,"My stepson had told me about this movie back in the 90s, and said his mom had it on a VHS tape. Somehow, I got hold of a copy of the book and also the DVD. Have loved it ever since. It is a story very well (1) told, (2) drawn, and (3) animated.

As for the thing about the missing David Bowie intro (see other reviews), if you must see it, go to YouTube. But as much as I looked forward to seeing that intro, the original intro fits way better for this piece. And as cool as is David Bowie, the author's intro works much better, as might be expected.

** Spoiler alert: the ending makes me cry, so when I re-watch the movie, I try to stop it right before that. But it is bittersweet, so sometimes I stick it out for the ""sweet"" part.",1451952000,4,733,3.945945945945946
2443259,5,B000BVN0ZA,"I previously purchased the DVD version of this short film and repurchased this year to get the HD instant video version. Wow, what a difference! The HD is a straight conversion from a 30+ year old film so you do see a lot of grain and imperfections especially in the live action opening as Raymond Briggs walks away from the trees. However, by and large the ""wiggly"" animation style is much clearer in HD than the standard definition version I've been watching all these years. For instance, on the DVD it is very hard to look at the flying sequence where you fly over the whale because the low resolution makes it look jumpy and muddled. In this HD transfer, that whale is clear as a bell.

Obviously, I love this movie since I've purchased it on VHS, DVD, and now HD instant video. It's a Christmas classic that I enjoyed as a child and am now sharing with my own children.",1450483200,8,875,4.401234567901234

2443283,5,B000BVN0ZA,"Back in the 1980's I discovered ""The Snowman'"" -- an incredible gem of animated storytelling, with equal measures of childhood nostalgia, holiday magic, and hearts-to-bursting love...and loss. We watch it year after year, as it is one of those sweet, memorable stories that stands the test of time. Beautifully drawn, the five star rating comes from the fact it is accompanied by gorgeous, ethereal music including the amazing  ""We're walking in the Air."" Highly recommend...Enjoy.",1419206400,7,481,5.413333333333333
