8475406,4,B005J4U8G8,Even though I may not recognize several of the invited performers I'm a firm believer that delving into all genras of music will make me a more competent performer myself. So I enjoyed this DVD and found it useful.,1434240000,,214,4.512820512820513

8475411,5,B005J4U8G8,"Once again, a great DVD product. Excellent presentation of various drummers. I especially appreciated the section which had the transcribed music from these talented artists. That way I can take my time to learn some of the more interesting parts. I have never been let down with these DVD series by Modern Drummer.",1361750400,,315,4.962264150943396
8475412,4,B005J4U8G8,"Contrary to some of the other reviews of this DVD, I am enjoying it more than sufficiently.  The Jeff Watts and Horacio Hernandez segments make this of more than the usual level of musical interest for an MD Festival DVD.  Having real ensembles playing actual music (and very intricate, interesting music, at that) is a refreshing break from the usual gymnastic soloing that makes up the bulk of these discs, most of the time.  The segment with John Riley is most interesting as well.  Three REALLY interesting segments is as good as these MD festivals get, so I say--go for it!  You will find a great deal of musical interest here.",1337817600,,632,4.657657657657658
8475413,3,B005J4U8G8,"I concur with other things written here. I have the 2008 festival DVD and it was MUCH better as was the 1998 weekend.

First of all, I think way more attention is paid to chops, speed and volume now than fully rounded, artful playing. Everything is loud and fast and bombastic and those qualities seem to be celebrated.

Buddy Rich, Louie Bellson, Joe Morello, Tony Williams, Vinnie Colaiuta, Dave Weckl, Steve Gadd, John Robinson, Simon Phillips, Todd Suchermann, Gavin Harrison, Jo Jo Mayer, Bernie Dresel, Jeff Hamilton, Peter Erskine -- these are several names that are keeping or have kept drumming an art. Find their stuff and LEARN from it! Bernie Dresel is an amazing big band drummer with Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band. (Just in case you didn't recognize that name.)

Drumming, in some instances, needs to be reexamined as musical art rather than athleticism! These young speedpounders have much to learn. Sure they can play fast and accurate as well but BORING??? Where are the ideas? Where do they build to climaxes?

The recording is very good. There are two really motivating players/situations this year:
1 - Jeff 'Tain' Watts - incredible journey into aggressive jazz drumming. His pianist is incredible as well!
2 - Horacio 'El Negro' Hernandez and his New World Order. Insane talent displayed here and VERY EXCITING. AND--watch the beauty that is evident in Horacio's drumming!!!!

Other than that, well.......you be the judge. Sorry guys. Maybe better luck next time. Gotta find the 'heavies' again.",1332979200,2,1518,5.031872509960159
8475414,4,B005J4U8G8,I'm glad we can finally watch the Rileys ! Both of them are great and enthousiastic. I've also enjoyed the amazing band of Horacio Hernandez. The rest is a bit boring I think...,1323475200,,177,4.393939393939394
8475415,2,B005J4U8G8,"I finished watching the DVD except for the Disc 2 morning session. First, I hardly recognize the drummers on these discs. I did recognize Hernandez since he has already appeared on past modern drummer sessions. It seemed the group he brought in played forever. They should have named this the Hernandez Modern Drummer Festival. It must be getting harder to find drummers to play at these events based on this years crop. The only player I enjoyed was Watts. He truly has mastered the art of making drums sound like a musically instrument. The morning session on DVD 1 was not very good. I thought the lesson was kind of too basic to be put on a DVD. Unlike in previous years there was bascally no discussions on technique. Just a bunch of drummers playing mostly to pre-recorded tracks. I haven't looked at the PDF's yet. If they are good maybe it is worth getting.",1323043200,,865,4.587096774193548
