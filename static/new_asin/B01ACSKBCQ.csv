8747088,4,B01ACSKBCQ,"This is a Scottish dark humour movie based on the Long Midnight of Barney Thomson by Douglas Lindsay.  Accents are thick and the characters (and actors) are older than your usual Hollywood cast, which may or may not be a plus for you but it's certainly different in an era where older actors complain they don't get offered good roles. The three main lead roles in this are all definitely good ones. Barney, a barber who many clients are prepared to wait significant amounts of time for one of the other two staff members to cut their hair when he's available.  Barney is rude, loud, opinionated and sleeps on the job.  He was hired by the boss' father decades ago before he retired so feels somewhat comfortable he can't be fired.  However the son is telling him otherwise and when he tells him his father has agreed to Barney's termination and tries to throw him out of the store, the scissors in Barney's hand end up in the son's heart.  Barney must now dispose of the body, but his mother (he's clearly still a mummy's boy) is insisting he take her to Bingo and wait for her outside.

Meanwhile an ageing police detective is trying to track down a serial killer who is taunting relatives of their victims by posting pieces of the victims to them in the mail.  He is however being hassled by a  female officer who is taking over his duties, much to his disgust.",1495929600,,1364,4.471774193548387
