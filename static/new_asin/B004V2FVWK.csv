It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Acting, Story/Plot. a story of friendship, courage and revenge. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. Despite to have the famous actors and the great line story, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. Sanjay Dutt was fantastic as always! Madhuri Dixt looks very beautiful and played her character very well. Amrish Puri was brilliant! He played his villain character extremely well. If you have't watched this movie,try it once, Do watch it.",1305849600,,663,4.824561403508772
