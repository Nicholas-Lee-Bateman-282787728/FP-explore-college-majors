8241206,5,B0011ACRBS,"i never believed i would find this movie after all these years and it's just as i remembered it. non-digitally enhanced (just the way i wanted it) and still action-packed. i understand more of the storyline now and it just makes it all the more enjoyable now. so thank you, ever so much, for bringing this classic back into my hands, and heart!
