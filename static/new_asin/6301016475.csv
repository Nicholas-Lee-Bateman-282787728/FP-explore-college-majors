7808868,5,6301016475,"This 1975 Glyndebourn Festival production of The Rake's Progress cannot be surpassed.  David Hockney's sets refer back to the 18th Century engravings by Hogarth that inspired Auden and Stravinsky.  He magically uses the effect of black and white engraving lines along with brightly colored costumes to achieve a feast for the eyes.  Bernard Haitink conducts Stravinsky's score with an ear for accuracy and affect.  Perhaps he might have directed with a mite more ""snap"" to the rhythms, but this is a very minor quibble.

Felicity Lott's Ann Truelove is sweetly innocent yet passionately in love.  Her singing is exquisitely produced and nuanced.  Goeke's Tom Rakewell's descent into greed, lust, boredom, and failed good intentions is masterfuly portrayed.  His voice is light and accurate, just as the score calls for.  When his love for Ann saves him from damnation and his association with the devil robs him of his sanity, the scene in Bedlam in which he thinks Ann is Venus and he sings of his love for her thinking he himself is Adonis - well, the heart breaks and breaks again.  Samuel Ramey's Nick Shadow is as good as it gets:  he is in turn charming, insidious, theatening, seductive, sarcastic and, yes, thoroughly diabolical.  Of course, his singing is impeccable.  One is reminded of how perfect a Mefistofele he made in Boito's opera of the same name (available on VHS and DVD in a San Francisco Opera production).  Rosalind Elias sings and plays Baba the Turk with her usual command of her art; she is simply fabulous, at times hilarious and at times imperious.  Richard van Allan brings vocal distinction together with dignity and compassion to the part of Father Truelove.  The other singers are excellent in their roles (Mother Goose, Sellem the auctioneer, the warden in Bedlam).  The acting and singing of the chorus cannot be faulted.

Everything is right about this production and this performance. It is now available on DVD.

Finally, for goodness' sake don't be drawn into buying the Salzburg Festival version available on DVD.  Although the singing and playing are first rate (Jerry Hadley, Dawn Upshaw, et al.), the stage production is a travesty.  The production is a stage director's ego trip and a fine example of ""Euro-trash.""  The ""Progress"" becomes a bohenian painter's search for his artistic aesthetic.  Tom wears paint spattered jeans and a Brando t-shirt.  Ann turns up throughout the opera wearing what seems to be a slip (perhaps a shift).  Nick Shadow is something of a Mafia thug.  Father Trulove is a hick farmer.  Baba the Turk wears a butterschotch leather jacket over a black t-shirt with a yellow happy face, together with a mini-skirt.  A group of monkeys comes and goes. Clown make-up is laid on increasingly thickly from act to act.  One can do an innovative production of this opera, as Sarah Caldwell once did in Boston, without disrespect for librettist and composer and without asking the performers to appear foolish.  Stay away from Salzburg 1994; go for Glyndebourn 1975.",1112227200,2,3027,4.984031936127744
