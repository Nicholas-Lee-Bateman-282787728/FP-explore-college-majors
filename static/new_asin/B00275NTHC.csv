3862041,3,B00275NTHC,"First of all, whatever your political leanings are, I cannot see how anybody can deny the political bias that went on in the news media this past election.

Let's summarize it:

Early on, it looked like the two major candidates were going to be Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton.  The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN were all nervous over this as most of the people at these networks desperately wanted the next President of the United States to be a Democrat.  They were so uneasy about Clinton's chances that they derailed her candidacy and put the spotlight on a young, articulate, African-American who was in better position to get the young vote, the moderate vote, and the liberal vote.  It would potentially hurt the female vote but the news media felt that Barack Obama, overall, would be a better candidate.  Meanwhile, these same networks did everything they could to convince America that Giuliani was unelectable and John McCain, as a moderate, would have a better chance.  They knew that the soft-spoken McCain would look timid, old, and weak next to Obama.  The scheme worked as suddenly, McCain and Obama started winning primaries.

Remember the stink Bill Clinton made about how the media was treating Hillary?  Remember how the once-adored Clinton was berated for his accusations?  That was just the beginning.

Everything was going as planned for the Obama campaign and the news media.  The polls in mid-summer 2008 clearly favored Obama.  That is until McCain dropped a bombshell in August 2008.  This bombshell was the choice of an outspoken, much truer conservative Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate.  Palin frightened the bejesus out of the news media as conservatives and many ex-Hillary supporters rallied behind her.  Suddenly the McCain campaign was a real threat to the Obama campaign and the hopes and dreams of the news media.  What did the news media do?  They launched a barrage of attacks on Sarah Palin.  They attacked her family.  They picked on where she shopped.  They accused her child of not being her child  They got Saturday Night Live to spoof her incessantly.  They got Katie Couric to interview her and Couric relentlessly attempted to ""gotcha"" Palin.  When all was said and done, enough damage had been done to the McCain/Palin ticket to get Obama elected.  It was an amazing display of contrast how Obama's running mate - Joe Biden, got virtually unnoticed during the entire campaign.

John Ziegler's Media Malpractice will review the 2008 campaign.  It shows examples of everything shown above.  Ziegler will present news clips, screenshots from blogs, and newspaper headlines that provide damning evidence that the news media was behind the Obama campaign all the way.  In this regard, the presentation should anger anybody who believes in fair journalism.

While I thought it was all worthwhile, I couldn't help but want more behind the scenes material.  I would have liked Ziegler to have directly challenged the media organizations concerning the 2008 campaign.  I would have liked some statistics to support and further drive home the whole point being made.  In these areas, the presentation falls short.

Nevertheless, the material shown here is disturbing to say the least and anyone who honestly believes the news media was fair should watch this DVD.",1241395200,43,3344,5.029143897996357

8354119,5,B00275NTHC,This documentary is a must watch for anyone who care about the news media and how it impacts elections. The film has been vindicated by nearly everything which has happened since the 2008 election. It is also rather funny. Almost like a dark comedy.,1381536000,,249,4.681818181818182
8354120,5,B00275NTHC,"I saw this movie when it premiered in Los Angeles.  I loaned the DVD to someone & didn't get it back, so this purchase was to replace it.

Excellent documentary and full of facts and examples.",1376870400,,192,4.305555555555555
8354121,1,B00275NTHC,"To use Sarah Palin as the advocate for what is right, which Ziegler later went against, seems fitting enough as an endorsement or lack thereof for this terribly skewed partisan piece.",1352419200,,183,4.935483870967742
8354122,1,B00275NTHC,"The documentary tries to portray Obama's victory was only due to the blessing of various media sources and not due to any other factors. The objective seems like showing the Republican party was the victim of media bias in 2008 and thus lost the election. The tone of the narration sounds like its a training video for Republican party workers to bash the media. In my humble opinion, a documentary is supposed to present facts to inform people, not take a side and ramble about it. This ""documentary"" does just the opposite, pick a side, find facts which can support the side and ramble about it.

I am not an Obama Fan or Republican Party Fan, I was looking for an interesting insight into the political battle. Needless to say I am disappointed. The documentary essentially says besides Fox, all the other news networks like MSNBC, NBC, CBS, CNN, ABC were in bed with the Obama campaign and bashed Palin and McCain. The documentary plays various clips from these channels where actually the news anchors are questioning Obama and his supporters. However, the documentary adds a twist to each of these clips by saying these clips were silenced by the channels. Really? How do you silence something which was played on national media? Why didn't Fox news do it share in raising such questions. They show only the democrat voters lack knowledge about their politics and republicans are again victims... Please...",1323820800,3,1412,4.858921161825726
8354123,5,B00275NTHC,"This documentary was absolutely eye-opening, well-researched, and very well-edited. The only disappointing thing about the documentary is that it wasn't marketed as it should have been. The documentary really could have gone far and I'm not sure why it didn't.

I recommend this to Palin lovers and haters because regardless of your stance, the subject in this DVD should be taken extremely seriously. I especially recommend this to aspiring journalists who need to be brought into the light and shown the sad state that journalism has become today.

Ziegler's exclusive interview with Sarah Palin alone is worth the price of the DVD as it gives the hidden story and  political motive behind the famous Katie Couric interview. The un-cut version of the interview is also an extra feature. And don't let your impression of Ziegler's appearances on cable networks deter you from this DVD. It really is that good. HIGHLY recommended.",1290384000,16,930,5.145695364238411
8354124,1,B00275NTHC,"Much of what was called biased during the election were the candidates very own words. The media can't ""getcha"" if there's nothing to get. Facts are never biased --how they're reported can and usually does add bias these days.

This comes off as if the media didn't persistently repeat lies, previously refuted, about President Obama as so-called ""news"".

The bias during the last election pales compared to what passes as ""news"" today! Opinions should not be sold to consumers as news and are inheritently BIASED.

The answer is to look at who owns the media and you'll find the bias always falls in the media owner's favor, of course, and serves the owner's best interests.

Fact checking ALWAYS helps!",1267488000,7,704,4.890756302521009
8354125,5,B00275NTHC,"In the production-values department, ""Media Malpractice"" may feel a bit rushed in spots but as of right now it's the most important post-election analysis released and couldn't be more timely or necessary.
As Ziegler marvelously stated as the film moved to a close:

This is not about President Obama. This is all about the unprecedented and dangerous media coverage that led to his election, and likely lead to his re-election. Our republic was founded on the concept that our electorate must be informed, and our elections be fair. As you have just seen, the evidence is overwhelming that our media has let us down in nearly every respect. If the grotesque display that we witnessed in 2008 does not provoke a backlash against this obvious reality, we may have just reached the point of no return.",1258761600,10,799,4.875
8354126,5,B00275NTHC,This documentary provides a comprehensive view of the 2008 presidential campaign media coverage including the tension between the Clinton and Obama campaigns. The eye-opening realization that the media chooses our presidents is supported with a variety of news sources and clips. Great one-on-one interviews with Sarah Palin.,1257120000,10,325,5.9361702127659575
8354127,5,B00275NTHC,"Television journalism is close to flat line in this country: Truth is no longer free viewing for the masses, maybe it never was.... It seems that this venue, DVD's produced by individuals who invest cash, time, and their reputation, into the effort, might be the way citizens get a balanced viewpoint on their big screens at home: but with powerful forces tugging at us from both sides, we individual Americans have quite a tightrope to walk on, with propaganda on both sides.
This video, while obviously pro-Palin, documents numerous examples of biased press coverage during the 08 election. While it doesn't have the slick packaging and features of a Hollywood DVD, it is a priceless piece of work that gives a viewpoint, and asks the viewer to consider the election coverage from that viewpoint. The DVD is a call to action for all of us who want honesty and integrity in news coverage...So I'm sure this DVD will be buried away, and it will be up to you to make an individual choice, spend the money to get information you need to be informed in the future.",1246492800,19,1061,4.679144385026738
