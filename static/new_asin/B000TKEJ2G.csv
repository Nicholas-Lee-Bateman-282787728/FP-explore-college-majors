8489186,2,B000TKEJ2G,"If you're looking for a nostalgic review of the 80s, this is your video.  If you'd rather have something more up-to-date, this is not the video for you.  Released in 2007, but looks as if it was made 20 years earlier.  Even the video quality is worse than low-res YOUTUBE.  Nothing here you won't learn online for free.  Take my advice and avoid this unless you just really have money to blow with no value expected in return.",1357430400,,426,4.410256410256411
8489187,1,B000TKEJ2G,"This Video is way...way outdated; marine electronics develop at a pace similar to other electronics; five to seven years would be the maximum life span; thereafter a warning should be posted with the video or book that its application is 3 or 4 generations behind state of the art. The equipment shown is even no longer sold as used equipment on ebay or similar venues or talked about in suppiers litterature. It is a waste of my money. The presentation in itself in the early 1990's would have been good though. If there are no independent book reviews, the site host should warn potential buyers of this issue.",1244332800,,612,4.675925925925926
