8254003,3,B00141CX9U,"Typical Euro-made mid-60's spy thriller.  A superspy has to thwart a master criminal who wants to infect selected governments with a super virus so he can conquer the world.  Locales were filmed in Bangkok, Thailand.  Kerwin Mathews is nice looking but does not seem like your typical lady-killer man-about-town guy.  The girls are interested and so is he but it is not tiresome like in the Bond pictures.  I bought a US region DVD-R and the quality is sub-par.  The picture quality is only fairly clear and the color is so bleached out only a valet's red coat seems in color.  Hopefully this film will be re-mastered someday.  Recommended for Euro-made spy thriller fans.",1435622400,,672,4.833333333333333
