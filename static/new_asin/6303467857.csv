655251,4,6303467857,"Saltimbanco is a really good show and can be viewed as a turning point for Cirque du Soleil.  The costumes, choreography, music, and acts have all improved over the previous shows.  This DVD has more acts than the Bravo TV special, but it lacks any special features other than trailers to other Cirque DVDs (a behind-the-scenes look would've been nice).  An interesting note: the duo who performs the hand balancing act are currently in Mystere doing almost the exact same performance as in Saltimbanco.  It's a much different experience watching Cirque live than on DVD, but if you can't get to a show, the DVD is worth it.",1006128000,2,624,4.75
655252,5,6303467857,"As is true in any similar performance, no matter where you sit you miss  some detail of the action.  And no matter how well behaved small children  are, the live performance is long for small children.  The video allows the  kids to watch their favorite parts with no blocked vision and to see  closeups that are unavailable to them in the live performance.
For  adults, the live performance is an experience only partially duplicated on  the video - although the video is well-made and edited.  It does, however,  provide an opportunity to enjoy the Cirque until it comes around next year  - without incuring the cost of a trip to Las Vegas.
Other reviewers have  given a good description of the show itself - high wire, contortionists,  strong men, juggler, boleadoros, mime, live music, trapeze, bungee cords  etc.  It is a nonstop show of physical control - timing, strength ...
If  you can't see the Cirque live, treat yourself to this video.",968025600,13,947,4.753086419753086
655253,5,6303467857,I bought Saltimbanco right after stepping out of Cirque du Soleil's La Nouba show at Downtown Disney. I was astonished with their performance and wanted a video that would keep forever the fantastic images of what my eyes  had just seen. Saltimbanco is a full Cirque du Soleil performance that you  watch over and over and never get tired of it. This video really captures  Cirque's spirit. Saltimbanco's soundtrack is a plus!,954201600,17,426,4.888888888888889
655254,5,6303467857,"I have seen four of Cirque's shows live and this video is the closest thing I've seen yet to how you experience the show in the live theater. One caveat, I haven't seen Quidam yet; so that one may be better.
I've read  other reviews where people complained about ""annoying camera  angles"" and ""extended closeups"", but from experience if you  go to a Cirque show and don't watch the stuff happening on the sides of the  stage, you've missed half the show.",953856000,6,454,4.5
655255,1,6303467857,"This is the third Cirque du Soleil I've seen and I am extremely disappointed!  (so are my children!)  The acts are still astounding and the performers every bit as amazing as before but the camera will drive you  insane! There is what I think would be an amazing tap dance by two girls  but the camera zooms on their faces almost the ENTIRE time they dance!  This is no exaggeration!  There is an astounding high wire act where the  girl does a back flip onto a lower and parallel wire and then she flips  back onto the higher parallel wire.  The camera is the best during this  routine and you can actually see most of the act! (except when the camera  zooms on the face of a clown who's watching the act for four seconds at a  time)  The music had a harsh annoying sound with screechy guitars mixed  with a big band sound. This video lacked the flow and unique feel of  Quidam, another of the cirque du soleil shows. As much as I love seeing the  talent of these artists, like the amazing juggler, I would have skipped  purchasing this movie if I'd known how frustrating the camera would  be....(It's worse than it's ever been!) I just cannot understand why any  director would have these astonishing performances filmed this way!  Why in  the world wouldn't they want to film it in the way that would enable the  best viewing of the show?  I strongly advise everyone to skip this  movie and try to catch the show live.  Or buy Quidam.",948067200,27,1437,4.393129770992366

655257,5,6303467857,"I haven't seen Saltimbanco live, but when i saw Quidam live i fell in love with Cirque du soliel. Eventually i learned all about Cirque Du soliel and when i recieved the Saltimbanco tape for Christmas it was by far my best  gift. The video sticks with you and the music haunts you for a long time.  Its everything Cirque Du Soliel should be.",946684800,6,341,4.3125
655258,5,6303467857,"Let's be honest. Seeing Saltimbanco Live is an experience by itself. Nothing really comes close to it by any stretch of the imagination. However, those wishing to capture memories of that very enchanted evening  will find this video absolutely wonderous. Directed by Jacques Payette and  original concept by Franco Dragone, this masterpiece will entertain viewers  right from the beginning. Although the brilliant opening in their live show  has been cut, this video starts off with the  most touching act called  Adagio, a trio consisting of a family performing amazing acrobatics  choreographed to a brilliant haunting score composed by Rene Dupere. This  is followed by the acrobates on the chinese poles which will dazzle  you  with their strength and precision. Watching the ' Chinese bird on the wire'  will totally take your breath away as will the next act which to me, is the  highlight of the tape. You will absolutely be blown away by Miguel Herrera  and his juggling act. His confidence and control of 7 balls at a time is  something you just can't grasp. His robotic manner in which he juggles,  performs different combinations and sequences totally timed to perfection  will simply leave you speechless. Following this are the amazing pair with  their boleadoros and the fun and comedic street performers on the Russian  Swing. The next highlight of the tape has to be the famous Lorador brothers  who have left Saltimbanco and are now performing in one of Cirque's  resident show 'Mystere' showing in Treasure Island Las Vegas. I'm telling  you, these lads must have bones of steel and the flexibility of rubber all  rolled in to one. The strength, power and control of their amazing routine  will leave you wondering why all men weren't created equal! This act known  as 'Hand to Hand' consists of several manoeuvres that the brothers perform  including headstands on the sole of a foot,  a hamstring lift with a man  doing a handstand on the soles of your feet and a most amazing balancing  act that has to be seen to be believed. Other acts include the twin sisters  on the double trapeze and the graceful artists on the bungee. In all , a  most amazing tape with wonderous visuals and even greater musical  performances by the singer and the band musicians. As they say,  "" When a Circus is not a Circus "".

655430,3,6303467857,"More than just the celebration of color that Saltimbanco is, it's also a great celebration of classic Cirque du Soleil. Saltimbanco is no longer a running production though it toured for years. It's one of the oldest Cirque du Soleil shows and while its age certainly shows, it's marvelous nostalgia. If Saltimbanco is not your first Cirque show you might not be as impressed, but it serves as a wonderful doorway into the world of Cirque du Soleil.",1452556800,,449,4.769230769230769

There are a couple of good acts. My complaint with the Cirque videos is camera angles and editing choices.

The DVD was much shorter than the show my wife saw in Tucson a few years ago. The DVD show was vastly different than what we ewxperienced live, but that was okay it brought back some great memories of the live show.

655597,4,6303467857,"I saw the show live in Portland Maine, was blown away by it, and went looking for the DVD. I was so pleased to find it here... and then so terrified after reading the 1-star reviews that I was going to be extremely disappointed when comparing it to the live performance. Well, no problem there; I think they did a fine job with the video production. Full disclosure: this is the only Cirque du Soleil show I've ever seen, and I have nothing to compare it to, either live shows or DVD, but I found nothing major to complain about with what they've done here. The first week I had the DVD, I watched it four times!

One thing I learned from watching the show on disc: I had a great seat in Portland, high up and off to the side, which turned out to be the best angle to view the acrobats. Head-on I doubt the Russian Swing act, for example, would have been as effective, and there's plenty of side-on camera work here that shows off the act to its best advantage. Likewise, the Chinese Poles act is nicely photographed and very effective; I can't wait to show friends what they missed by not going along with me!

Another reviewer mentioned disliking the sudden close-up of a clown's face in response to a particularly astonishing part of the performance: I LOVE that shot. Yes, it cuts away from the performer for a moment, but the combination of the clown's expression of joy plus the accompanying crescendo in the musical score create a beautiful, unforgettable moment.

Likewise, I thought they did a nice job with the close-up camera on the juggler's act, even putting the camera beneath the transparent platform where he was performing, angled straight up. This was an interesting angle and served to underscore how impressive his control was.

I would say that one specific spot where they probably could have done a bit better was the shot where the dual-wire-walker (they didn't have this act in Portland) leaps from the lower wire to the higher one... from the camera angle they chose, it's difficult to appreciate the fact that there's several feet of height difference between the two wires. And I would agree with a previous reviewer that the percussion act performed by the two women included too many close-ups of their faces... it's interesting to see the concentration, but the real eye-catcher was what they were doing with their instruments against the floor. But these are minor quibbles... I only include them to indicate that I've read and considered the remarks of others who weren't as pleased with the on-average quality of the product as I was.

Not as exciting as seeing it live, but how could it be? This is an excellent memento of an unforgettable evening!",1350950400,2,2683,4.66384778012685
655598,5,6303467857,I have always loved Cirque & the shows I have seen I had this on VHS so I needed to get a DVD. Awesome!!!,1315785600,,105,3.4166666666666665
655599,4,6303467857,The DVD for this performance is of a pretty good quality.  The music and visuals are very good.  Having seen the performance live earlier this year we were eager to get the DVD to remind us of our wonderful experience.  The only slight criticism I have is that at times the camera was focused on facial close ups of performers who were sitting around the stage rather than on the actual acts in the air etc.  However this is only minimal and one is still able to enjoy the major performances which are so perfectly executed.  I am very glad we purchased the DVD.,1315699200,,562,4.365384615384615
655600,4,6303467857,"This is a highly imaginative production, full of wild costumes, talented performers, and a wonderful soundtrack. The film starts with an act that has a narrative implied by the acrobats that appear to be a loving family. It is a charming work. The father, mother, and little girl are superb in acrobatic skills but at also conveying affection and family bounds in a circus act. As they perform a group of acrobats approach as if they were slithering lizards, who when they have the opportunity to take the full stage perform on Chinese poles as if they were monkeys or insects.  The third act is a Chinese tightrope walker who is as charming as a child's doll.  This is followed by a juggler whose act is enhanced by cameras set below his feet looking up. A pair of women, looking much like Spanish flamenco dancers, perform with boleadoros, an act I have never seen before.  The Lorador brothers were extremely appealing in their act of grace and outstanding strength. Their act was the most compelling in the entire production.  The lifting of one brother by another when one was balancing on he soles of the other's feet, thus requiring that the larger brother lift him entirely with his calves will amaze you. I found the film to be sexy, entertaining, beautifully creative, and witty.",1265328000,,1289,4.741071428571429

655730,5,6303467857,"A lot of people look at Cirque du Soleil as acrobats and flexible people, but there is much more to it and Saltimbanco is a perfect example of that.  This is a great story of people of all different cultures coming together.  The music is excellent and provides a total aural experience to go with the amazing visuals.  This multi-camera shoot is well done and something you will watch again and again.",1239235200,,402,4.555555555555555

655732,5,6303467857,"Cirque Du Soleil doesn't respond to the everyday concept that everyday people have of circus. First off, there are no animals in any show of them, a fact that allready sets a difference. Like Cirque's founder Guy Lalibert once said: ""every show we do, we take it like if it would be a Broadway show"" Now, this fact hasn't been there since the beginning. The first shows of Cirque, like ""We reinvent the Circus"" or ""New Experience"" had nothing to do with the way the Cirque is now. It wasn't until this one, Saltimbanco, that things got in motion.
Saltimbanco is, like all the others after it (Dralion, Alegra, Quidam, La Nouba and many more) some kind of living dream. Like any normality, you have a stage, and several people come and do their numbers, that go from classic to very innovative. But then, there is more. Aside from just doing acrobatics the way it has been done all those years, this guys take their points up to a literally level. To a tale that reflects an actuality and a critic of the world. Some just pass, others smash (Quidam)
And then, all of this is wrapped up in a painting like style in both music and lights, costumes and voices, and a superb theater acting. Saltimbanco isn't the tuffest or deepest thing of the Cirque, is just the start of what Cirque Du Soleil always represents in every show, with unique aspects one from another: Life.",1215820800,,1367,4.538461538461538

The Boy in this DVD when he grows up stars in the Cirque Performance of Varekai.  These DVDs transport you back to your youth and keeps the kid in you alive.,1207785600,,426,4.035714285714286

655735,3,6303467857,"Anyone familiar with Cirque du Soleil knows that a spectacular performance is in the offing under any one of their tents.  I saw Saltimbanco in person years ago, but this recording simply failed to capture the awe and excitement I felt while seeing the live show.

My disappointment with this DVD's visual aspects stems from the choice of the editors to continually cut from the real-time performance and superimpose either slow-motion or close-up sequences, causing a disruption in what one sees of a given act's flow of movement.  As one example, there are far too many very close-in face shots of the two women (Boleadoras) who are performing a routine where balls whirling on the end of strings smack the floor in rhythm to the music.  The precision and spectacle of such a routine is lost when one can't see the arms and hands of the performer, let alone the props crucial to the act.  In other instances, slow-motion cuts right into the middle of the action sequence, thus jarring the continuity of what is supposed to be a spectacular trick.  Also, throughout the show, the camera cuts away frequently to costumed peripheral characters who are emoting some sort of amazement.  There's little relevance in this, and it does nothing but take the view away from the activity (where it should be).  Even the sound editing seems goofy at times, with the audience roaring a bit too early at points during the ""Russian Swing"" routine.

The run-time is under 80 minutes, but take away the introduction, credits, and the silly gun duel routine (""Draw!""), and you're left with only around an hour of the true Cirque spectacle.  Still, there's some value in what ""wow factor"" remains of this show.  My favorite routine by far is ""Juggling,"" where the performer progresses from three to seven balls, many times bouncing them off the floor in a choreographed flow (the guy just doesn't slip up!).  Also noteworthy are the ""Double Tightrope,"" ""Russian Swing"" and ""Hand Balancing"" acts.

I'd recommend this to Cirque du Soleil fans who are not picky about videography, or to those who want to get something of interest for their children.",1135296000,10,2130,4.867036011080333
655736,1,6303467857,"My experience with Cirque shows are having seen both ""O"" and ""Mystere"" in Vegas.  Both are phenomenal shows and I constanlty recommend both to friends and family.  Well worth the trip.  On DVD I have only viewed ""Allegria"" and ""Satimbanco"", although I am awaiting the arrival of ""Quidam"" from Amazon.  My review of Allegria is great, it is a must own.  My review of ""Saltimbanco"" is the 1 star.  Halfway through it, I was embarrassed to be watching it.  The music was poor, definitely the worst of the shows that I have been to.  The costumes and sets rate at the negative level.  This appeared to be the most embarrassing of all.  Most of the Cirque shows take you to a dream-like, surrealistic place of imagination created by a master artist.  This had the imagination of a 1st grader, who is watching ""Full House"" on TV and designing sets during the commercials.  The talent of the cast is still fabulous, but it strongly overshadowed by sub, sub, subpar music and costume.  As stated in many other reviews, the camera work was faulty and the poor choice for shots was unexpected.",1073520000,12,1083,4.636842105263158
655737,2,6303467857,"Anyone expecting the lush extravagance of Journey of Man, the wry enchantment of Quidam or the dazzlement of the new Varekai is in for a severe disappointment. The music verges on the unendurable, with whole performances drowned in the worst kind of smooth jazz with moments of 80s synthesizer schlock. The talent of the acrobats and aerialists is matched only by the fetor of their wardrobe, an unimaginably hideous panoply of dreck, sort of 'punk rock on an acid trip' meets 'revenge of the psycho hairdresser.'
There are a handful of bright moments -- a 'family' scene at the beginning that was quite touching, a nimble group of pole-climbers, and some lithe bungee-aerialists toward the end. The lead singer is striking and has a beautiful, ethereal voice - but someone should shoot her costume designer.
My overall opinion is that Cirque du Soleil offers better fare for the price. Check out Varekai, Quidam, Dralion, or the Journey of Man, all of which are much superior.",1068422400,10,977,4.927272727272728
655738,1,6303467857,"I didn't really want to rate this 1 star but I wanted to make a point of how badly a 5-star performance was ruined by just terrible camera work and/or editing. As far as the actual acts this is probably the best of all the Cirque DVDs, but the bizarre
angles just ruin it. How on earth could they have released something like this? If they still have the original tapes they should put together a decent version and give it away free to atone for this mess. What evrybody else said is so true; meaningless close-ups, angles that prevent you from seeing what the performer is really doing, etc. Case in point: the juggler Miguel Herrera is just fantastic but the terrible angles and close-ups really keep you from appreciating it. For the finale of his act he walks down 4 flights of stairs juggling 5 or 6 balls and all you can see are his feet! What genius opted for this shot? The last act, the bungee jumpers, are shown from angles so that you really wouldn't even know what they were doing if you hadn't seen the title. A real travesty and a shame.",1049068800,18,1052,4.345177664974619
655739,3,6303467857,"I bought this DVD because of my previous viewing of ""Quidam"" which was fantastic. But alas! though the show has its own character, it was ruined by mostly irritating unecessary and prolonged intercuts and over-all poor camera directing. Having worked as a producer and camera director myself, I was irritated no end by the close-up and medium shots of acts that one may view better as a full-shot. One always has a purpose for including or excluding persons and objects in a given shot. In many of these instances in Saltimbanco, as in the wire act, the blocking was never well-thought out and seemed instantaneous.
As usual, Soleil's acts, costumes and music were fantastic, especially the ball-juggling act. Well, here, the director somewhat got a good one with a glass view of the juggler and balls from below! Other than this, it's all pretty much ""happen-what-may"" for the one behind the booth controls, it seems.
It is for this reason that I regret having bought it. With Soleil  though, you'll never go wrong, however much one of its own technical people tries to foul it up. Fire the camera-director or send him to an apprenticeship program, please!",1006560000,6,1157,4.873096446700508
