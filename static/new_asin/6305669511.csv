1065511,5,6305669511,"I was surprized when this film came out.  I didn't think it would. The plot was pure genius and was well produced, especially
with the low budget.  It was also Congo Drummer, ""Chaino's"" first
film appearance. It was interesting to see him as young as he was
when he recorded 6 LP's that have appeared in many films and Videos since, HBO's ""Sex and the City"" and Steven speilbergs, ""The Forces of nature."" This film will no doube become a classic, being the first film for ""Dennis Hopper."" We love it.  It's the kind of film one can enjoy no matter how many times they see it.",1003536000,7,575,4.355140186915888
1065512,5,6305669511,"This film is a fine example of how low budget is sometimes better than big budget: its qualities come partly from moody black and white lighting on ordinary locations and subtle suggestions of fear and the supernatural with lighting and editing rather than blatant special effects. It has a quiet and eerie, dream-like atmosphere, with excellent acting by Dennis Hopper, Luana Anders, and Linda Lawson as ""Mora the Mermaid."" The music score by David Raksin is excellent, and a rare example of a major film composer working on a very small budgeted film. Curtis Harrington's directing creates a sense of psychological eerieness and shadowy imagery rarely seen since the Val Lewton classics of the forties, which it is similar to (especially the original ""Cat People"" with Simone Simon). This DVD release is very good quality, and features an excellent and informative commentary by Curtis Harrington and Dennis Hopper.",1003449600,15,917,5.202702702702703
1065513,5,6305669511,"I won't go into a treatise on the film except to say that it is one of my sentimental favorites of the fantasy genre (inspired by Val Lewton's films of the 40s, particularly Cat People) even though there's no monsters, sci-fi apparatus, etc. Just a wonderful, evocative mood and sense of place, offbeat and interesting characters, effective photography, etc. According to the accompanying commentary, Harrington and Hopper felt they were making a ""movie of the streets"" like the Italian directors and I think that's part of what contributes to Night Tide's uniqueness; that feel really comes through. Anyway the DVD is very clean, the best I've ever seen the film, letterboxed, with no video or audio problems that I noticed. The commentary, although there are occasional lulls, is quite interesting. Harrington and Hopper have to jog each other's memories a bit (although Hopper eventually remembers quite a bit more detail about the movie than one would expect) and some fascinating bits are revealed (they identify nearly every location they shot on, many of which could still be visited by the intrepid.) In summary, fans of serious, atmospheric fantasy-horror (or Lewton freaks) won't be disappointed in the movie or the DVD.",998352000,18,1230,5.155
1065596,4,6305669511,"Adapted from the writer-director's own short story ""The Secrets of the Sea"" (published in Curtis Harrington's autobiography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nice-Guys-Don-t-Work-in-Hollywood/dp/1937112071/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nice Guys Don't Work in Hollywood</a>), Night Tide tells the story of a young sailor (Dennis Hopper) who falls for a sideshow illusionist (Linda Lawson) who may or may not be a mermaid.  Roger Corman felt the story was too unconventional to sell but he helped Harrington raise funding, which should give anyone who knows movies an idea of the kind of budget/conditions they had to work with. Like ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Night of the Living Dead,"" this Val Lewton-esque film is rough around the edges, but it's so surreal and oozing with atmosphere that it's not hard to figure out why it's so well-regarded.

As for the Blu-Ray, this is as good as it gets.  Unfortunately, there are many inherent flaws due to the low-budget nature of the production and the original camera negatives are long lost, so this was transferred from a 35mm print.  Grain is obvious, the picture's a bit jumpy in one spot, there's occasional lines and flecks -- it's what one would expect from a print, but the details are much sharper than in previous home video editions.  '

Extras include an informative audio commentary with Harrington & Hopper which was recorded for the 1998 laserdisc , the trailer and two episodes of David Del Valle's 1987 public access show ""Sinister Cinema"" in which Harrington was interviewed at length (the first episode includes a great deal of discussion about Night Tide, as well as his early&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Short-Films/dp/B00CENU4MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Short Films</a>).

1065597,5,6305669511,"Moody, dreamy, even sad little horror film that turns out to be not a horror film after all.  What struck me the most is the meeting of two lonely people who have no one else in their lives, a young sailor and a beautiful carnival worker.  The girl has the belief that she is descended from sea people (mermaids), and that they are calling her back to the sea.  Her delusion is not helped by her work as a carnival mermaid.  Also not helping is a strange woman who lurks in the background and when she confronts the girl, she speaks in a strange language that upsets the girl.  The girl's boss, the carnival barker for her act, who took her in when she was a child, also speak about her as if she is cursed by this strange heritage.  The music also adds to the strange, moody story.  The Kino DVD release, which is the one I have, is probably the best one out there.  It has some extras and trailers and a GREAT cover.  The Milestone Collection / Image Entertainment DVD release matches the Kino in quality.  The Alpha DVD release is only OK.  The one to get is either the Kino OR the Image Entertainment.

An odd and mysterious ""beat generation"" entry, it was marketed as a horror film but really isn't.  It does however have wonderful performances by Dennis Hopper (one of his best) and gorgeous Linda Lawson.  It also boasts fine music by David Raksin and an intriguing story and direction by Curtis Harrington.",1383782400,,416,4.52
1065599,4,6305669511,"Curtis Harrington was an authentic cineaste whose early work was entirely experimental. Among the films he worked on before branching out on his own (as an actor and a cinematographer) were Kenneth Anger`s Puce Moment (1949) and Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954). Reportedly, he was involved with Maya Deren, and certainly sang her praises throughout his life. Rather than continuing in the avant-garde vein, Harrington's first feature film was the nightmarish cult oddity Night Tide (1961). It's been dubbed a horror film, but the label isn't entirely adequate. Elements of James Whale, Jean Cocteau, Val Lewton, andEdgar Allan Poe are like layered slivers in this ethereal mermaid opus.

Night Tide was also the late Dennis Hopper's first feature film. So cemented is his psychotic reputation from films like Blue Velvet (1986) and River's Edge (1986) that his role here as a clean cut all-American boy under the spell of an aquatic succubus might be a little disconcerting. Yet, Hopper brings an element of vulnerability and pathos to his lonely sailor that makes him ideally cast as one lovestruck for the mermaid of the full moon, and helps make Night Tide deserving of its reputation as a quirky original.

In its subtlety and evocative atmosphere Night Tide owes most to Cat People (1942). While Linda Lawson, very effective in the role of Mora, is not quite in the league of Simone Simon, Hopper is far more convincing and sympathetic than Kent Smith was in the Lewton production. Deren's mystical influence ebbs through Harrington's script, his cinematography and the overall milieu. As much as Harrington tried to sell his film as a commercial thriller, his previous work shaped Night Tide, stamped it as unorthodox, and certainly hurt its commercial viability.

While on leave, Johnny (Hopper), looking for female companionship, roams through a Venice Beach carnival and meets the mysterious Mora (Lawson) at a jazz bar. Strangely enough, we never see Johnny with other sailors. He only seems a sailor because we are told he is one. Otherwise, he is an outsider, dislocated in the world, and draws to another misfit soul in Mora (which makes more sense than the bourgeoisie Oliver being attracted to exotic Irena in the afore mentioned Cat People). Mora plays a mermaid in a sideshow exhibit in the carnival. Her employer is her adoptive father, Captain Sam (Gavin Muir). Johnny's relationship with Mora is replete with obstacles, the biggest being Mora's latent belief that she turns into a mermaid during the fill moon. Sam reveals to Johnny that he found Mora on a Mediterranean Island. Sam's explanation is intentionally vague and masks incestuous desire. Ellen (Luana Anders, with a cup of coffee seemingly glued to her hand), is an employee of the carnival and clearly drawn and attracted to Johnny. But,  Ellen's  concern for Johnny's welfare is foremost, since two of Mora's former boyfriends died of mysterious circumstances. With one beguiling exception, Night Tide is revealed to be entirely psychological.

That one exception is the bizarre presence of one of Mora's ""Sea People."" This presence is intentionally never explained, and even contradicts the revelations of the film. The casting of the Sea Witch is intriguingly layered: she is played by Marjorie Cameron, who happened to be a real life disciple of Aleister Crowley. The remaining casting sells the film: Hopper, Lawson, Anders, and Muir are superb in their eccentric roles. Harrington's camera captures them repeatedly in cerebral close-ups.

There has been renewed interest in Harrington lately. Flicker Alley has recently released ""The Curtis Harrington Short Film Collection"", and Night Tide is receiving a Blu-ray release in October.

1065600,2,6305669511,"As far as it goes, a good vehicle to introduce Dennis Hopper. But, poor film quality, poor sound quality, a not very tight plot, and lousy editing make me wonder why it's rated as such a classic-and a 50yr edition hoopla added.
This reminds me of an amateur attempt by film class students to put out their first movie project.

1065601,3,6305669511,"This movie was among the l00 so-called Horror Classics in the Mill Creek boxed set.
This collection has set around for about 6 months after I became exhausted from watching one movie after another but I'm so happy I finally watched this one.
I was thrilled with the beauty of this black and white indie made in l960. The location photography at Santa Monica, musical scoring and the performances were amazingly good.
But the performer who was just impossibly wonderful was a young, beautiful Dennis Hopper--before his ""Madman"" celebrity in his later years.
His soft, innocent voice, his natural way of acting and reacting shows us that he could have been James Dean's successor if the fates had been kinder to him.  He's also great looking in his pure white sailor's uniform and I thought what a wonderful Billy Budd he would have made. I've never seen Hopper in a solo starring role although I knew he was one of the ""gang"" in ""Rebel Without a Cause."" In ""Easy Rider"" his stunning good looks was buried beneath beard and mangy hair.
Unfortunately for his legacy, he's mostly known today for playing the psycho villain in ""Speed.
To see him front and center of a camera was a revelation--showing us a charismatic young Adonis who should have been a major movie star if only he had the breaks.
The other performers were standouts and I would love to have been on the set during the  making of ""Night Tide"" to hear what they talked about, what they ate, how the scenes were set up.
What prevents this movie from being a true classic is that the story line suggests the heroine might actually be a mermaid and we never know for sure.
The very brief fantasy scene of her wearing a mermaid apparatus is crude and too brief. If audiences were hooping to see a ""monster movie"" then they were probably more than disappointed.
Which is why I was, too, since this title was included in the boxed set of ""l00 Horror Masterpieces.""
As a mood movie, this is outstanding, with its beautiful shots of waves, the ocean, and unusual interiors of a beatnik bar and the seedy surroundings of the amusement park.
Perhaps they could remake this one, this time having a genuine mermaid character--but it would impossible to find an actor who could surpass the wonderful, young Dennis Hopper at the very beginning of his troubled career.",1364515200,2,2314,4.669117647058823
1065602,5,6305669511,"I caught this film for the first time on afternoon tv in the early 70s.  My room mate and I were prepared for a laugher and ended up being blown away.  The 3 leads all give convincing performances ; the affects aren't great but they aren't cheezy either ; the waterfront atmosphere is terrific - smoky underground jazz clubs, seedy carnivals, twisting, turning nighborhoods(much of the LA coastline was still like this all they way from Venice down thru Newport Beach right into the 70s).  Every great film starts with a great story and script.  This film gives something for Dennis Hopper to do besides look completely paranoid.  Great fun.

1065603,5,6305669511,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this 1961 horror thriller...

Night Tide (1961) is an offbeat, black and white, moody, atmospheric thriller that is a cult classic and is often compared to another early '60s black and white cult classic horror movie, Carnival Of Souls (1962).  Both these movies have that low budget, independent film feel to them.  Night Tide features a young Dennis Hopper, Linda Lawson, Marjorie Cameron, Marjorie Eaton, and Luana Anders.  The atmosphere is moody and pretty dark and creepy in parts.  It has an excellent carnival atmosphere, a fortune teller, a mermaid, and lots of good camera angles.  It was shot on location in Venice Beach and Santa Monica, California in 1960, which will bring back a sense of nostalgia for some.

Overall, this is a good movie that I assign 4 1/2 stars to, rounded up to 5.",1353542400,3,880,4.781456953642384

1065605,2,6305669511,"If you think the Night Tide- - 50 years anniversary edition offers a clearer print as compared to even the lowest budget DVD productions of this film, forget it. This edition is NOT remastered. The product description doesn't mention remastering but the fact that it is an anniversary edition was enough to make me purchase it and check. The sound is crisp and clear but the picture is grainy with jumpy film splices and spots on many of the moving images. You would be better served purchasing a version of the film which costs less than $9.99.

As for the film, it is an excellent light horror film which works better if thought of as a mystery story. The more you think about this film after seeing it, the more of a mystery it becomes even though, on the surface, most of the story appears to be answered. After thinking about some of the characters, their possible motivations for doing what they do, the mystery surrounding Mora only grows.

The acting, direction and especially the script which is beautifully written with all the characters sharing the common thread of loneliness is all well done and it recommends itself so much more than any Roger Corman film in this genre. I highly recommend this film and it deserves to be remastered in a REAL 50th Anniversary Edition and not what Amazon is offering for sale here for $9.99",1330041600,14,1338,4.641350210970464
1065657,3,6305669511,"<strong>Night Tide</strong> (Curtis Harrington, 1961)

These days, Curtis Harrington is remembered as a director--when he is remembered at all--for such Z-grade horror productions as the made-for-TV <em>Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell</em> and <em>Killer Bees</em>. But Harrington was a great deal more than a made-for-TV hack, having started off his career as a film critic and actor (most notably in Kenneth Anger's <em>Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</em>) who dabbled in avant-garde shorts before turning to horror. There's still a bit of that in <em>Night Tide</em>, Harrington's first feature, but not enough to make it more than a run-of-the-mill mermaid tale. Still, it's acres better than <em>Killer Bees</em>.

Plot: Johnny Drake (Dennis Hopper) is a sailor on leave in Venice Beach, CA. While taking in the sights at a small jazz club, he finds himself drawn to Mora (<em>Sometimes a Great Notion</em>'s Linda Lawson, better-remembered these days as a nightclub singer than an actress), who plays a mermaid at a local carnival. Or is she just playing? One way or the other, however, her boyfriends seem to have a habit of turning up dead, as Johnny is informed by the local fortune teller, Madame Romanovitch (<em>Mary Poppins</em>' Marjorie Eaton). Which wouldn't be a problem, since Johnny has another possible romantic interest--Ellen (<em>Dementia 13</em>'s Luana Anders), the carousel owner's granddaughter--except that Mora seems to have this almost supernatural hold over him...

It's a pretty good flick, often compared to <em>Carnival of Souls</em> in that they both rely pretty heavily on atmosphere for their thrills, which was pretty gutsy when the horror landscape was full of radioactive monsters. <em>Night Tide</em> is more effective atmospherically than <em>Carnival of Souls</em>, and it has more fully-realized characters, but it still feels wooden; there's a very good reason Lawson is better remembered as a nightclub singer these days.

There are also those who will complain about the quotidian ending, and I've seen more than one person comment that some things are left unresolved. Don't be that guy. You pay enough attention to the last five minutes of the movie and it all makes sense. It's not nearly as quotidian as you think. Solid filmmaking, not necessarily something to go out of your way to hunt down, but if you see it show up late night on Turner Classic Movies, it's worth eating up an hour and a half of DVR space for. ***",1312761600,2,2470,5.22979797979798

This is one of my favorite films. 1960's Venice Beach, a young sailor played by Dennis Hopper falls in love with a sideshow mermaid named 'Mora'  ( Linda Larsen.)
 I was shown this film two years ago in London when I was in a play  called ""Babalon"" at the John Guilgud Theater.  I played Marjorie Cameron, widow of Jack Parsons, infamous Californian magician and protege of Alistair Crowley.  The real 'Cameron' has a cameo in this film as a sea-priestess who haunts Mora. Her character gives the psychological mystery a supernatural possibility.

Dennis Hopper is a sailer in the Navy spending some time on the Santa Monica boardwalk. He meets and pursues a beautiful woman named Mora. Turns out she works with her guardian in a boardwalk sideshow as a mermaid.

There is a lot in this movie that has nothing or little to do with the plot. If I wanted to see a lonely military service member spending time on leave doing nothing interesting at all, I would just videotape myself.

Dennis is warned that his life is in danger when the full moon arrives. Mora has already had two boyfriends die in mysterious drowning accidents. He pays no attention to his tarot card reading and decides to go scuba diving with Mora. This is where I get lost.

They dive together and Mora takes Dennis' knife and cuts his air hose. He makes it back to the service. Then he sits on the dingy for hours, Mora never comes back up. Then he spends the night by himself in a hotel.

OK, then he goes back to the boardwalk to see Mora as the mermaid. HE goes in to see her and SHE'S dead! How did this happen. Then her guardian the drunk old retired Royal Navy Captain pulls a gun on him.

At the police station the old man admits that Mora was just an ordinary girl and it was he himself that had been killing boyfriends. So the monster in this movie is an old drunk pervert.

The movie begins when a horny Johnny Drake enters the Blue Grotto looking for someone to share his mojo with. Unfortunately, most of the women in the jazz night club already have partners or don't even acknowledge Johnny's existence.  Then, across the crowded room, Johnny catches the eye of a beautiful brunette sitting across the way. He approaches and though she pushes him off, the romantic sparks start to fly.  He learns that her name is Mora. Then some strange woman shows up mumbling some wierd words to the girl. Whatever the old lady said makes the girl get up in a hurry. Johnny follows and catches up with her. The persistent little devil walks with her to her apartment and gets her to invite him to breakfast the next day. The relationship begins. Things don't get very far before Johnny learns from the people who run the carousel below Mora's apartment that her last two boyfriends disappeared and have never been seen. Mora also works as a mermaid at the local side show run by her former guardian. The job pays pretty well, but Mora actually believes that she is a mermaid allowed to live on land and that when the moon gets full the sea beckons her back home.  By this time Johnny is madly in love with the girl and doesn't know what to do. A full moon is approaching and Mora acts more strange all the time. A fateful diving expedition ends up revealing the truth.

NIGHT TIDE was filmed on a budget of less than $76,000. It was the film that gave Dennis Hopper his first major break. The title of the movie is based upon a poem by Edgar Allen Poe and the film has gained a cult following over the years. The movie reminded me of watching an episode from ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS. With a mood such as that, it's easy to understand the cult following. Nevertheless, though I was impressed at how well the film was made on such a small budget, I found the picture to just be an average movie.

Directed and written by Curtis Harrington.

This review is for the Alpha Video DVD release for 2003.

This is one of those little-known films I watched during late night television in the 1980's.  I was so intrigued, I never forgot it.  Now I finally own the DVD copy of it.  This film is interesting to watch and really has that weird 1960's feel to it. Kind of like a supernatural film noir.
  This film offers the most relaxed performance I've ever seen Dennis Hopper play in any film and he was the age of 24 at the time.  This isn't your normal beach movie and it's in black & white.
  It is August. Johnny Drake (Dennis Hopper) plays a U.S. Navy sailor on shore leave.  He roams around Santa Monica pier and comes across the Blue Grotto, a nice jazz place.  There he meets a woman with long black hair, ""Mora"" (Linda Lawson). A mysterious old woman comes out (Marjorie Cameron) and tells ""Mora"" she must leave quickly. John is so drawn to Mora that he follows her into the night on the beach.  She lives in an apartment above the Merry-Go-Round.  John asks her if he may see her again tomorrow for breakfast.  A friendship begins.  Mora's job is an attraction at the amusement pier.  In the side show, she is the mermaid. However, their is another side of Mora so mysterious that Johnny doesn't know.
  Memorable good scenes are those when Johnny follows the old water witch to Venice and who can't forget Marjorie Eaton as the Fortune Teller.

1065664,3,6305669511,"This otherwise typical low-budgeter probably has its fans for two reasons.  One, obviously, is the intriguing presence of young Dennis Hopper.  The other--maybe not so obviously--is that the feature is a not-bad little noir, replete with brooding atmosphere, smokey chiaroscuro, and an everyman enthralled with an exotic, enigmatic woman.  The movie's main problem is poor pacing, exacerbated by a tinny, monotonous score.  There are also plot lapses that have nothing to do with the leading lady's origins.  Though reminiscent of Cat People, the film merely flirts with horror, though it smacks enough of the supernatural to pose lingering, disquieting questions.

1065665,5,6305669511,"I saw this film first in 1963 as the 2nd half of a double-bill; American-International pictures usually put out the Corman/Poe films which were mostly under 90 minutes in length, and they filled up the time by throwing this off as a 2nd bill. It was certainly better than ""The Comedy of Terrors"" (1st bill). Here we have Curtis Harrington before he ""went Hollywood"" (Who Slew Auntie Roo?, etc.), an intuitive director who creates an atmosphere that's hard to describe; slow moving, never boring, always compelling. An innovator of the ""indie"" scene, Harrington couldn't find a distributor in 1961, but A-I picked it up. There's a wonderful bongo/jazz score and a wonderfully understated and heartfelt performance from Dennis Hopper (before he tried to impress everyone with his individuality and maverick style). The photography, often in dark venues, is remarkably clear and atmospheric. There's also the excellent Luana Anders, who, along with Salome Jens, was never given the career she deserved. The style of this film seems to suggest a mood which the great John Frankenheimer later perfected (""Seconds""). Not a horror film, ""Night Tide"" certainly had a head-start on the psychological suspense stories that became popular. Definitey worth a look!",1053907200,8,1252,5.265
1065666,4,6305669511,"Great low-budget indy horror film from the 60s inspired by the Val Lewton classic 'Cat People'. Fans of other b/w indy horror flicks like 'Carnival of Souls' should really enjoy it. It stars the great Dennis Hopper ('Giant', 'Easy Rider', 'River's Edge', 'Blue Velvet', etc.) as a naive young sailor named Johnny who falls for a mysterious & beautiful girl called Mora. Mora works as ""Mora the Mermaid"" in a sideshow during the day on a CA Boardwalk. After they become lovers, Johnny discovers that Mora's last two boyfriends mysteriously drowned and soon he starts wondering if Mora is a real mermaid or one of the spooky ""Sea People"".
The soundtrack is a mix of great bongo numbers & bad b-movie music, but the real highlight is the eerie atmosphere and great stylized photography. The director tried hard to raise ""Night Tide"" out of the usual b-movie abyss and it shows. Excellent flick!",1047081600,42,891,4.830065359477124
7893843,5,6305669511,"Val Lewton inspired. Cat People comes directly to mind. Especially the scene where a mysterious woman (Marjorie Cameron) passes Mora by (Linda Lawson) intoning a foreign-sounding incantation that appears to affect Mora deeply.

Also brought to mind is The Museum of Extraordinary Things, Alice Hoffman's novel about a girl held captive and displayed as a sideshow attraction by her perverse father.

Not to mention Carnival of Souls with its glimpses of carnival underbelly mixed with Bohemian vibe. Yet, Night Tide is a subtle, gentle film. It creeps up on you (no actual pun intended) because you care about the characters and what happens to them.

Dennis Hopper, looking very much like a young Paul Newman, is excellent as Johnny, a lonely sailor equally full of heart and filled with heartbreak. The merry-go-round attendant's granddaughter (Luana Anders) is completely believable as a decent, caring young lady who has seen and heard more than many her age and accepts the oddness of life and those who live such a life with compassion.

At surface a love story. At core a commentary on the good and the bad of caring too much, and controlling selfishly.

What was also a draw for me was that it was shot at the Santa Monica Pier and surrounding locale. One background prop is the merry-go-round.

7893848,3,6305669511,"Night Tide could and should have been a far better film than it is. The story is interesting with  a haunting quality and is typical B movie fare and that last comment is NOT a put down. B films have their place and style and it is worth noting that the original 1958 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers was intended as a B movie and became a true classic and one of the best science-fiction films ever.
What really Spoils Night Tide is the absolutely terrible, amateurishly written script and somnabulistic acting by almost all concerned. The somnabulistic acting has nothing to do with the story which some seem to believe it does. It's just poor acting due possibly to the writing, direction or who knows what. The only performance that rings true in spite of the dumb dialogue given her is by the late Luana Anders who rises above the mediocrity in a turn reminiscent of Jennifer Tilly's brief scene as a waitress in The Fabulous Baker Boys which really attracted attention.  The score by David Raksin, one of the real giants of film scoring is superb and shows true mastery of his craft that can be appreciated even more fully by musicians like myself who often listen critically to film scores as the film progresses. My biggest gripe of the film is about the death scene near the end in which the viewer will have to imagine what actually happens even though it' is obvious if not actually visible, thanks to atrocious photography of a crucial scene. An then there's what I find to be one of the great unintentionally funny lines in film history; Dennis Hopper has been invited by Linda Lawson (Mora) to lunch (or breakfast). Her apartment at the Santa Monica Pier  is at the top of a  tall structure above a carousel  that plays loud typical carousel-style cheesy music. When he asks her why she  lives above a merry-g-round she answers (with a straight face that must have been a real effort to maintain), ""I like the music."" This, boys and girls, is a line worthy of a Woody Allen farce, and who knows, I've often wondered if it wasn't written in as an inside gag to make up for the dumb dialogue.
Now, despite all these carps, I still like this film for for what it might have been in better hands.  Then, of course there's Linda Lawson as Mora, the fake (or perhaps real) mermaid which she and her character help to alleviate the many flaws. She is not to be overlooked and should have gotten more leads in films. So, all complaints aside, this is still a film worth seeing if you just look (and listen) past the gaffes.
Lawson, BTW recorded a pretty decent little known vocal jazz album  way back around 1959, ""Introducing Linda Lawson""  with Marty Paich conducting and writing and an uncredited Art Pepper on some solos (still available at Amazon) and she did a pretty fine job of it. Plus, it includes ""Where Flamingos Fly"" and ""Meaning of the Blues"" which indicates that this is a very hip lady.",1454716800,,2917,4.540952380952381

7893850,4,6305669511,"Released in 1961, Night Tide stars Dennis Hopper as a sailor in Venice, California, who falls for a mysterious raven-haired beauty who poses as a mermaid at the local carnival (Linda Lawson). Gavin Muir plays the old sea salt guardian of the young woman, Marjorie Cameron a shadowy older woman and Luana Anders the daughter of the carousel owner (Tom Dillon). Marjorie Eaton is also on hand as a fortune teller.

This is an atmospheric mystery tale in the manner of 1962s Carnival of Souls and not conventional horror. Its interesting to see Hopper so young, normal and courteous in his pre-hippie days (as opposed to his later weirdo roles in movies like Blue Velvet and Rivers Edge, both from 1986). The movies slow, haunting and entertaining as a period piece where you get to see beatniks partying on the beach and other intriguing things. If you like carnival-oriented movies you should definitely check this out. Just be aware that the ending leaves everything open to interpretation (explored below).

Shot in B&W, the movie runs 86 minutes and was shot in Venice, Santa Monica and Malibu, California.

GRADE: B

COMMENTARY ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie)

According to the literal interpretation, the mysterious old woman was likely hired by the captain to pester Mora to convince her she is a 'sea-person' so she will stay with him; the reason Mora tries to Kill Hopper's character at the end is that she THINKS shes a killer. She didn't kill her other two suitors, but became convinced she did via the captains brainwashing. It was the jealous captain who killed them.

In the figurative interpretation Hopper is a lonely sailor who meets an older sailor, also lonely. The young sailor is looking at his future self. Mora is the savage beauty of nature, symbolic of the sea itself. Like the oceans, she is unforgiving, but both sailors love her. When she kills she is above judgment, like the ocean itself, and you can't judge her.

Then theres the question of how Mora died. The captain only confesses to the murders of Mora's suitors because he was in love with Mora and his jealousy drove him to kill the young rivals for her affection. So how did Mora die? Since the young sailor (Hopper) took the only boat and left her in the open sea she must've drowned. However, it's left open how the captain retrieved Mora's body. Either her body washed ashore and he found her or he was tailing the couple when they went diving and he went to find Mora after Hopper's character left the scene and found her dead body. The other possibility is that the captain killed her when he found her alive, but why would he do that if he loved her? Unless it was because he felt she was cheating on him.

The other literal interpretation, of course, is that Mora really was a mermaid and the old woman was a sea person as well but, if this is true, how did Mora die in the water when the young sailor left her in the ocean since a sea person wouldnt drown? Unless the captain thought he was going to lose Mora forever to the sea people and so he killed her after the sailor left.",1437436800,,3109,4.59927797833935
