8738934,5,B00NDAF84C,"The Shema Meditation through the Chakras DVD is beautiful and masterful offering from renowned certified yoga therapist and Jewish spiritual director Robin Rothenberg.

This DVD encapsulates so much of what is the essence of yoga, as it brings together two ancient spiritual traditions to create a delightful union that is expressed in a harmonious mind-body meditative experience.

Robin, along with composer Nancy Rumbel has taken the six-word first sentence of the Jewish prayer the Shema and created an exquisite mantra that transcends religious boundaries. The chanting of the Shema is redolent of the mystical middle-east and is accompanied by superb imagery of nature. Ronins explanation of the meaning of the words of the Shema and how they correlate to the chakras helps deepen the meditative experience and a simple vinyasa or sequence of yoga postures is offered for those wishing to use movement as part of this cross-cultural meditation.

I personally found the Shema Meditation through the Chakras to be a moving and deeply centering experience and encourage others to treat themselves to this unique meditation.",1426550400,,1126,5.386363636363637
