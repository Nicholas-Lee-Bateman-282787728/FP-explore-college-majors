8324054,5,B000BQOQ4E,"Gotan Project's concert DVD highlighting their La Revancha Del Tango CD is an entirely spellbinding and captivating experience, not to be missed by any Gotan fan.

The quality of the video is first rate ... which wouldn't be all that important if the sound quality didn't match up ... rest assured, the sound quality is quite good, up to CD standards.
So, if you own a nice home theater set-up and enjoy the Gotan sound, you are in for a treat ( the bass lines provide the sub woof with plenty of action :-)

I've had this DVD for a few years now, and never tire of seeing and listening to it every few months.",1348185600,,610,4.2956521739130435
