7898969,2,6305996040,"I purchased the Denise Austin Trimwalk thru Amazon and it arrived promptly and appeared to be brand new and very inexpensive.  However, the cassette tape is defective, would like to order another one but cannot locate the ad for it. help me.  I am not asking for money back, just send me another cassette and the vcr and bill me the same price as I paid for it.  MY first tape was purchased years ago and is just now starting to wear out, I really would miss not having it to listen to while I am walking.  It helps me to keep moving.",1323129600,,534,4.155339805825243

This audio tape and her modivatioal talk is the only thing that get me out there when nothing else would.
The one thing I like best is when she talks to me is ----Squeeze your buttocks you'll look good what behind L.O.L. And hoping no one driving see me do that yet just wait till it's toned.  Had several stop me and ask why are you walking like that swinging your arms and going slower and then going faster and I say I'm trimwalking  --Denise Austin's trimwalk tapes --get one and join me who knows maybe I can get a group together and Denise could come join us ---I WISH, HOW AMAZING WOULD THAT BE.

  Thanks:  Mary Servin
