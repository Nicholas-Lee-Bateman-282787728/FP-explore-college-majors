8290800,5,B001D0SPR6,"Navy Blues-This is a fun, light comedy about a group of sailors on leave who make a bet. Our hero sailor uses some white lies to woo the affections of a bookish librarian, but things start to unravel for him. A charming movie to curl up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn with.
The Nav Way-In this patriotic drama, a boxer must resign himself to the fact that he'll miss his big chance as a prize fighter and helping his poor parents. His sailor buddies rally to his side in this heart warming flick. These 2 movies are an entertaining reminder a glorious time in the USA!",1217635200,,573,4.26605504587156
