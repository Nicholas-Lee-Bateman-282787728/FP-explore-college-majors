8142926,1,B000069HXN,"My fault for not reviewing what it was. It does have about 2 or 3 pretty girls, semi nude but not even this is worth the DVD. The wrestling is insulting to the viewer's intellect, although I know this is not intended for anything but seeing very fake wrestling in a very stupid way.",1425081600,,282,4.2407407407407405
8142927,1,B000069HXN,This was the WORST in the series! You have two bozos trying to be funny that weren't and some of the cheesiest matches ever captured on video. The babes were the only bright spot. If you want to pick a really cool DVD get AMERICA'S WILDEST BACHELOR PARTIES.,1040774400,,257,4.375
8142928,3,B000069HXN,and this was the worst one the only thing good about it is the death match features and some of the babes but the others suck like the have misplaced nipples and weird stuff and masked horndog and el drunko ruin it don't buy it,1030233600,,227,4.066666666666666
8142929,1,B000069HXN,"How can you ruin a video with gorgeous babes who get topless and nude?  Add 2 idiots that aren't funny, show them as much as the girls, move the camera so much the viewer gets dizzy, and edit the footage of the girls so much it is more a series of still pictures than a video.  This gives ""amatuer video"" a bad name.  The girls are all great, one is cinsational, but with 5 cuts a second, digitizing and image over image editing, shooting into the light, bouncing the camera all over, it is usually hard to tell.  Some things are so bad they are funny, usually not intended (Plan 9 from Outer Space).  El Drunko and Horndog are intended to be funny, but are just bad.  Even Tylene in a barely there top and thong can't save the scenes.  Each girl has a Meet the Babe segment, but each is less than a minute with almost more edits than seconds. (If just these segments had been about 5 minutes or more each, with most scenes 15 seconds or longer, this would easily have been 5 stars, the girls are that good.)  The rest is short outtakes and bloopers that often include the camera panning to the sky, ground, etc. as the cameraman relaxes his arm as they prepare to redo the shoot.  Guys, get a tripod, and let the girls do the moving, not the camera.  Believe it or not, that is what motion pictures were originally intended to be.  (Quit watching MTV and see Hitchcock's film ""Rope"" to understand how minimal editing gets the viewer to feel he is there watching in person, which is especially important for Girlie videos!)",1028332800,4,1523,4.365248226950355
8142930,5,B000069HXN,"Man this DVD was great.  It had hot chicks nude in swiimming pools.  Whip cream.  Deep throating bananas.  And alot more.
To bad they had el drunko and masked horndog in it.",1025308800,4,173,4.3125
8142931,3,B000069HXN,"If you want T and A then this is the video for you. Lots of hot chicks and lots of nudity. My only complaint is that the hottest chick, Tylene Buck aka Major Gunns, does NOT get naked. What's up with that? Otherwise its a nice T and A video.",1012176000,,241,3.84
