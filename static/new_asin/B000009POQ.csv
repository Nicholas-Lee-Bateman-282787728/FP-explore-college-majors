8363640,4,B000009POQ,"The trio, Carter Wong, Roc Tien and Polly Shang Kwan, were superb in this Shaolin Classic. The story of a young Shaolin student(Roc Tien) whose parents were killed by the ching dictators. He studied Kung-fu for revenge, but his only way out was to pass through the chambers of the 18 bronzemen. He managed to do this with the help of his colleague(Carter Wong). He later learned of his parent's killers and was bent on revenge. Polly Shang Kwan was quite impressive as the obnoxious wife to be.  Great fight scenes with the 18 bronzemen. Not bad for a film made in the 70's. Better than the new wirefu stuff...",985305600,,610,4.545454545454546
