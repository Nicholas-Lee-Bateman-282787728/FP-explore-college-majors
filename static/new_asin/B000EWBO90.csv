8115004,1,B000EWBO90,"""Sizzling erotic thriller""?  Hah!  Total waste of plastic...not a single woman in the movie has anything but balloon breasts--those hard, perfectly round, stretched-out-aureoles things that don't respond to gravity let alone any movement of the person in question.  And the guys are all buffed out body-builders.  And all of them are about as dumb as a board fence and read their lines (from prompters no doubt) with about as much animation as a corpse.  I find it hard to believe this kind of  'plastic ware' was still being produced in 1995, let alone brought to the DVD market in 2006.  Are their still people out there who actually enjoy watching such puerile crap?  I guess the marketers know there are always plenty of saps out here who will fall for their sales pitch, like I did.  My disc has already been placed in the recycle bin and with any luck I'll at least be able to think I may have saved others from the same fate.",1439683200,5,932,4.566265060240964

8115007,3,B000EWBO90,"""Sinful Intrigue"" is a terrible, terrible movie--darn near unwatchable, actually, and thank God that there are naked breasts on screen for about 80 percent of the hour and a half runtime or there would be absolutely no reason ever to put this thing into a DVD player.

Even at that, the quality of the bosoms in question are so subpar that this still doesn't chart very high on the review-o-meter. Not a single solitary pair of real ones in the entire film, and trust me, a LOT of women get topless in this forgettable flop. Pretty reflective of the time period: False blonds with flat butts and $5,800 boob jobs.

That in itself, of course, isn't what makes this a bad movie. Pretty much everything else about it does: The acting is atrocious (star Beckie Mullen's turn is so horrendous that you might end up physically ill, as I did--there's a reason why she never headlined another film); the writing is just as bad (meandering, nonsensical plot and way too many characters that are interchangeable). Despite the frequency of the nude scenes, the pacing is godawful and you'll find yourself wondering when the hell that it's going to be over. The nude scenes themselves aren't even fulfilling, as there are only two instances of full frontal and those are quite brief. This was the heyday of the erotic thriller so I can't quite figure out why the creators couldn't seem to do any better.

I'd suggest passing on this one. Your 90 minutes is better spent doing almost anything else.",1422057600,9,1485,4.703846153846154

8115009,2,B000EWBO90,"I saw this movie on Skinimax several years ago, in my formative days, and thought that it still might be SOMEWHAT boner-inducing.  Wrong.  The movie is bland and dispassionate with unnaturally staged sex scenes.  The fake breasts are appalling.  Overall, pretty lame.",1284940800,5,267,5.285714285714286
