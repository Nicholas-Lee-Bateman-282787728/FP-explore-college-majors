8429767,3,B004HZGSXC,"""Freshman Fall"" is a one-watch thriller that I would recommend if only for the social message, but I have yet to watch it again, and if it hadn't come with this 3 movie box-set, I would not have purchased it for keeps as a stand alone movie.  To end on a positive note, in addition to the sound social message (the rape of a girl at a frat party, and the rapist who refuses to take any responsibility because sex with a drunk girl who is almost passed out, can't possibly be rape because he's the good-looking ""Man on Campus""), I love the actors in this movie and overall, while I may not be in a hurry to see it again, the script is well written and the story very valid.

""The Killing Secret"":  Boring!  I'd never seen it before buying the box-set, but the synopsis had me interested to watch it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the movie itself.  I wouldn't bother watching it again.

""Violation of Trust"":  The guilty pleasure and the very reason I purchased this box-set, and overall this very' 90's TV movie made the purchase worth it for me.  However, for those who are more interested in ""Inspired by actual events"" made-for-TV-movies, there are a lot of plot holes...and ""Why would anyone do that???"" questions.  For me, it was a guilty pleasure indeed.  I saw the movie when it first came out around 1991 via a DIY VHS tape provided through the courtesy of my grandmother (may she rest in peace), and have wanted to see it again ever since!  I love the fact that I own it now.  Brings back great memories!  It's also good to see Katey Segal in a serious role.  I was never impressed with Peg Bundy, but Katey Segal makes you forget all about Peg in a role which allows her to play a real maternal figure, even if the plot is not entirely realistic.",1456358400,,1766,4.390769230769231
