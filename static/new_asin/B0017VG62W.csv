Don't get me wrong, it definitely has its moments. However, I was expecting a more violent and gore splattered type of film. The scenery in the entire thing is excellent because the entire film takes place in the beautiful countryside of Indonesia. I like the way the entire movie takes place away from society with you looking at these great locations throughout the film. The story isn't complicated. This woman is tossed over a cliff and is caught by a black magic user. He then teaches her his occult stuff so she can seek vengeance. The brief topless nudity is fogged out because this is an old Indonesian film. There's no explicit sex in the movie either. As for the gore, there's some really cool scenes. The gory ending when the guy explodes is good, and there's some other stuff like when a guy plucks off his own head which then flies around. If you watch the trailer, it gives away some of the gore. If you're expecting something really violent like LADY TERMINATOR, then I wouldn't recommend it. LADY TERMINATOR still has more replay value because it's much faster paced with a lot more violence, but this is a better crafted and made film. Overall, it's really nice to look at and plays well on a rainy day or at night; However, I thought it would've been much better if she was just running amok throughout the entire thing and splattering people with all of her spells.

The extra with the studio tour is good, and the quality on the DVD is excellent. Because of the setting in the entire film, the quality needs to look really nice so you can enjoy it.",1459468800,,1730,4.544871794871795
8267478,4,B0017VG62W,"I wouldn't know where to begin to explain this oddity. There's plenty of nasty black magic mumbo-jumbo crap going on like insect attacks, worm-infested drownings, flying heads, exploding sores, fireballs etc. We get to see maggot-infested bodies and food bowls, exploding spellcraft victims, hilarious and stupid dialogue (and dubbing) and exotic locations in the jungles of Indonesia.

Queen of Black Magic (1979) is a ""sequel-in-name"" to the two Black Magic films that came out from the Shaw Brothers in HK, in the 70's. The sound effects and dubbing department are hilarious, which makes this film all the more worthwhile.

Sometimes I just can't help but think of this movie as a good counterpart to the cannibal films that came out of Italy in the late '70's/early '80's, despite the fact that there are no cannibals in this movie. ""Black Magic Terror"" is a total trip into weird Indonesian silliness.",1389830400,,906,5.073825503355705
