If they re-digitize it and release it on DVD with HD clarity (instead of just dumping the VHS interlaced video to Disk), many people would buy it! I have the current DVD release and it is worse than the FREE, public domain copy offered at Archive.org ;-( Good luck!",1447372800,2,312,4.491228070175438

7909339,4,B00000I1SD,"What can I say? I'm a bit of a sucker for space opera anime The first time I saw Odin was during it's run on the Sci Fi Channel's Anime Festival and I must've watced it several times after taping it. However... it's not for everyone and I don't see the film making it in today's anime market. Your average anime fan would fing this boring and difficult to sit through. It takes about 15 minutes or more for the crew to actually make the voyage to the planet Odin. So why did I give this movie 4 stars after I just told you that the average person who saw this would hate it? Well... the story actually is interesting once the mutiny occurs. Unlike today's anime and possibly the ultra violent stuff such as MD Giest or Angel Cop, the characters are pretty damn likeable. You can sympathize with them as you watch them deal with the situations set before them as they occur. Even though I understand why so few people like Odin, I highly recommend this if you're looking for an engaging story.",1361404800,3,992,4.338709677419355
7909340,4,B00000I1SD,"First I would like to state I mark most Manga Corps/Central Park Media titles high. This due to the fact that the first anime titles i ever saw were Manga Corps titles that aired on Sci Fi chanel back in the late 90's.

Anyway onto the review

As several of the reveiws mention this one is a space opera(soap opera/drama in space). Crew of this new ship head for some where, save a girl, find an old space ship frozen in ice and then go off to the back side of nowhere(which is probably pretty desolate in space) They find the origin of all inteligent life, fight this big thing, and it ends with no real concluding events taking place. Typical late 80's/early 90's ending. The bigges flaw is that this plot is more suited to a longer format like a multi episode OVA that could delve deeper into the themes. If you want to get into the titles of the late 80's i recomend this one along with Project A-ko, Gall Force. Odin isn't ground breaking, but its not a bad one for an escape from modern cliches in anime.",1160265600,6,1010,4.282722513089006
7909341,3,B00000I1SD,"If you are a fan of the old Starblazers show, then you will like this movie. It has all the same elements: a long space voyage, space battles and impossible technologies (a solar sail powered spaceship would be VERY slow and hard to steer).

Even the animation looks similar. The real difference is that this movie is only about 90 minutes long while it would take a couple of weekends to watch all the Starblazers episodes. Odin is not great Anime but it is a nice diversion.",1098316800,4,476,4.471264367816092
7909342,3,B00000I1SD,This is a fun movie to watch.  If you don't take it too seriously.,972777600,,66,3.7142857142857144
7909343,2,B00000I1SD,"In short, new crew of a new solar sail powered ship find young girl in space. Go against orders to help her. Go on long, long trip of discovery & discover......NOTHING!  Only good part...opening few minutes of this  anime. I wish I could find the  cd.",945129600,7,251,4.413043478260869
