7801033,4,1559742879,"Isadora Duncan: Movement From the Soul
Excellent documentary of the Artistic contribution of an American Pioneer Dancer who emerged from the isolation and restrictions of the 19th Century through her own vision and perservation to inspire fellow artists and audiences in the Western world.  Her sense of humanity lives on through her deciples.

The reconstruction of her dances are as inspiring today as they were when she created them.",1245024000,3,436,5.304347826086956
7801034,5,1559742879,"The movie shows excerpts of Isadora's dances, danced by Lori Bellilove, a wonderful dancer. This is what interested me most in that movie. It also is a good summary of the life and work of Isadora Duncan. The pictures are of good quality.",1197331200,13,238,4.558139534883721
7801035,5,1559742879,"I remember watching this DVD in college (I was a dance major).  I absolutely love it!  It was in excellent condition and played perfectly!  It is a great movie to show the beginnings of modern dance... yes the earliest form! And you can tell! hehehe.  A lot of dancers don't know how, when or where modern dance originated from and it was Isadora.  This movie showed some of her works, not the original form, but re-staged by students of the Duncan technique.  It was very interesting to see how the changes in her life effected her works.  My husband found it extremely fascinating (although he is trying to learn as much as he can about dance).  This DVD also talked about her professional life, personal life, as well as the happiness and the tragedy that followed.  I recommend this to all dancers!  You need to know about this woman!  Even though her movements are simplistic, they are extremely powerful and she was brilliant!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Isadora-Duncan-Movement-From-The-Soul/dp/B000H6SVH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Isadora Duncan:  Movement From The Soul</a>",1185667200,26,1124,5.508771929824562
7801036,5,1559742879,"Largely forgotten now, Isadora Duncan was the pre-eminent free-form dancer of the first three decades of the 20th century. ""Movement from the Soul"" re-creates her iconoclastic choreography and dancing style, always set to selected classical music (Beethoven, J. Strauss, Sate and Scriabin are among the featured composers). Duncan's career is outlined by photos and newspaper clippings, but unfortunately there are no motion picture clips. She died at age 50 in 1927, strangled by her own scarf caught around the rear wheel of an open car. For the social and political issues that embroiled her in constant controversy see the movie ""Isadora"" (1968) with Vanessa Redgrave in the lead role. Duncan's autobiography is still in print. The movie and the book are available through Amazon.com",1174262400,23,787,5.354838709677419
7801037,5,1559742879,"I have seen most of the videos available regarding Isadora Duncan, and this is by far my favorite.  The video is structured like a Ken Burns documentary with still photos and an assortment of period film clippings supplemented with voiceovers for the primary cast of characters.  Julie Harris supplies the voice of Isadora Duncan (a wonderful choice!) and reads excerpts from Isadora's autobiography (My Life). She has a very expressive voice and makes you feel like you are listening to a wonderful storyteller reminiscing about her colorful and exciting life.
Examples of some of Isadora's best-known choreographies are performed by Lori Bellilove and Madeleine Lytton with a background chorus from the Oakland ballet.  Lori in particular brings Isadora's choreography alive and makes you think that you have caught a glimpse of the legendary dancer and an idea of why she so fascinated audiences.  Wonderful video... the dance excerpts alone are worth the purchase price.  Highly recommended!",1063238400,18,995,5.352564102564102
