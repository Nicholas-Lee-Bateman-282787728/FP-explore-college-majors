8311238,1,B001IOMWSA,Take care if you purchase this product!! I bought one and had to return it due to a defective place in the Song from Carmen. I bought it again...FOR MORE MONEY THAN THE FIRST ONE...and it was defective in the same place!!!  Unfortunately I did not check it in time and now I cannot return it. Must be a defective lot. I checked on another player just to be sure. TOTALLY wasted my money.,1506124800,,387,4.22972972972973
8311239,5,B001IOMWSA,"This DVD offers a great combination: Beautiful music, performed with excellence and style, and a wonderfully entertaining show. The numbers with Mr. Mulder's three sons are delightful- they are downright fun. It's pretty amazing to see how the pianist manages to conduct the orchestra while playing all 88 of those keys (with his music, it sounds like there must be a lot more keys on that piano!) This is the kind of program you can enjoy watching many times.",1379203200,,460,4.8354430379746836

Also enjoy the fact that his boys play 6 handed piano & it is just precious.",1355702400,,154,4.275862068965517
