8145604,4,B000IHYXLM,"Cute children's anime. Well animated and decent story. I did not find it as confusing as one reviewer stated - it is episodical, but wraps up the story nicely in the end.
Well worth watching for broad-minded anime fans, although it's most probably not something that I will watch twice.",1201305600,3,286,4.74
8145605,4,B000IHYXLM,"This is a cute and fun anime for kids. I do not think it has the same draw as some of the more serious anime out there. It is a realtivly short series but it is cute and does not have an overly violent plot, as is the case with some. I would say that this is great for kids 10y and younger. As with the other review listed, do not expect a serious or highly engaging adult storyline. Follows the similar vain as the Smurfs or Strawberry Shortcake.",1199145600,3,447,4.033707865168539
8145606,1,B000IHYXLM,"This anime is truly awful. I found myself making fun of it then enjoying the story. I never finish the whole series, because I could not sit through the first couple of episodes. At first the story was cute and fun , but then the plot got confusing and I lost interest quickly. This series could of been so much better. I recommened rented this before you buy it. That way you can form your own take on the anime. Overall, I thought the anime was too random and confusing. ""Sailor Moon"" and "" Ah! My Goddess,"" are animes you want to continue to watch over and over. "" Magical Meow Meow,"" Is a anime you want to return.",1173312000,5,618,4.201680672268908
