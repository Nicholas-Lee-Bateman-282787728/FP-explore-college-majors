7558927,4,B018V7Z6AM,"We enjoyed the episodes, but the quality of the videos was not as good as I had expected. The resolution seemed a bit low even for a DVD and the colors at times seemed washed out. The entertainment value was high, but video quality was low.",1455235200,3,240,4.239130434782608
7558928,4,B018V7Z6AM,"Just like Volume 1 (Season 1), it's actually five stars for the new series itself, but still with only nine episodes per volume, there could be a lot more since there are already 50+ episodes and season 2 has since begun in the US. That being said, the episodes included on this collection are even better than those on the first, focusing a lot on the relationships between the Chipmunks and the Chipettes; Episodes include:

-Clowning Around
-Slippin' Through My Fingers
-Jeanette Enchanted
-Principal Interest (note Alvin singing ""I Wish I Could Speak French"" from the Alvin show [1961], originally from the 1960 album ""Around the World with the Chipmunks"")
-My Sister the Weirdo
-Bully for You
-Who's the Animal
-Sister Act
-Saving Simon

And like Volume 1, the French version of all of these episodes are also included, but no booklet this time. Also interesting is that Simon is pictured on the disc, whereas Alvin was pictured in Volume 1....could that mean that there will be a Volume 3 (not yet listed on Amazon), with a picture of Theodore, and then go fom there??

Again, hope to add many more Volumes to my collection because this series is again the best thing the Chipmunks have done in at least 25 years. Thanks so much to Janice Karman and the entire Bagdasarian family for bringing back the Chipmunks and Chipettes I've known and loved my whole life!",1453334400,7,1367,4.7594936708860756

8743142,5,B018V7Z6AM,Love these episodes and was thrilled to find them available on DVD since they were quickly removed from iTunes. Hopefully additional seasons will become available in the future. I'm attaching an image that provides the back of the DVD case to help others see what episodes are included since there wasn't one included (at least at the time I purchased). Hope that helps.,1504051200,2,370,4.888888888888889
