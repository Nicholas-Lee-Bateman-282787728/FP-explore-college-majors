7902685,3,B000003K8O,"In the season 4 finale we see Odo lured into the Gamma Quadrant in an  attempt to find a cure for the disease that has infected him, he cannot  hold a solid shape. Once he enters Dominion space and transmits an urgent  message to the Founders in the hope that they will know of a cure - the  Defiant is quickly surrounded by Jem'hadar.
Odo beams down to the  surface of the new homeworld of the Founders, with Sisko and Bashir, the  Female Changeling leads Odo into the Great Link (which seems to have  expanded hugely since the last time we saw it in The Search). Time passes,  possibly days, and Odo finally emerges. He is weak, but solid, apparently  cured. It is at this point that we learn that Odo IS solid, a punishment  for killing another Changeling (season three finale). Once Odo returns to  the station he sees an image of Gowron, the leader of the Klingon Empire,  he realises he is a Changeling!
A fairly good stand-alone episode that  sets up season five with a lot of possibilities, unfortunately the next  season doesn't quite flow as smoothly as the last two. All in all a good  solid, no pun intended, script but not a very exciting season finale!",966729600,3,1166,4.459715639810427
