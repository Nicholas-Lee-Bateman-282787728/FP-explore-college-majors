8635432,4,6304545576,"I have been an Elvis fan for a long time.  When Red and Sonny wrote their book, ""Elvis, What Happened?"" it was out of anger and hurt.  Now, years later they have put the anger aside and speak from their hearts.  They loved Elvis, and he loved them.  Unfortunately everything isn't always  beautiful.  They share their story as they remember it.  The good, the bad,  etc.  They were there, and I value there views of their lives with Elvis.  We get a realistic view of what Elvis was going through during the concert  years.  Thanks guys.",962841600,6,537,4.479166666666667
