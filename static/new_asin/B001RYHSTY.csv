I can see why the show went off the air, too many changes, most of the sexy female cast listed on the box are not even on this season, they changed the format from soap opera type stories, lots of sexy eye candy, sexy slo-mo, to a more serious less sexy show, even the opening and ending credits changed to more drab and boring. the new female members
can't hold a candle to the old stars. Its OK as a stand alone series but if your looking for any of the old baywatch trademarks, forget it.this season is the worst of the francise. kinda like comparing ""CONAN the BARBARIAN"" to CONAN the DESTROYER"". BLAH!",1344470400,,692,4.4140625

8339257,5,B001RYHSTY,"Baywatch at a whole new level. Hawaii is a very beautiful island. Stacy Kamano as Kekoa Tanaka, she is pretty with a beautiful body. Brooks Burns as Jessie Owens is also beautiful. Actor Jason Momoa as Jason Ione is a cool actor. Jason Brooks as Sean Monroe, he is so mean. Not nice and friendly as Mitch Buchannon, played by David Hassellhoff. The strong waves trapping the victims under a secluded cave. And the Baywatch Hawaii crew got to use some sort of jet ski to rescue them. This version of Baywatch Hawaii show is very intense. I absolutely love it. 5 stars! Baywatch fans? I truly recommend Baywatch Hawaii. This particular season. I haven't seen the second version yet. But I do also have it. Thanks!",1328572800,,711,4.606299212598425
