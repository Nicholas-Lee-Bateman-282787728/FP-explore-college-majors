5003512,5,B006LMRMMA,"Just finished watching.  I'm a huge HPL fan, and while many of the movie adaptations are less than great, I was looking forward to this one.  The HPLHS's previous movie, 'The Call of Cthulhu' was good on so many levels.  And they do not disappoint here.  There is additions to the story, to well, make a movie out of a story that's mostly letters back and forth, but it's not forced.  Each bit makes sense in the overall story.  Plus, they did a great job in making the movie feel like a 30's talkie.  So yes, if you like HPL, you will enjoy this movie.",1324684800,16,553,4.20952380952381
5003513,5,B006LMRMMA,"A stunning adaptation of a Lovecraft classic!  I am not sure how they pulled it off, but this is straight out of the Golden Age of 1930s horror films even though it is brand new!  Filmed in ""Mythoscope"" a style which strives to make it look true to a 1930s Black and White Noir film, they've taken what was a good Lovecraft story and made it a brilliant piece of film making.  They kept true to the spirit of the plot and turned it up to eleven.  If you are unfamiliar with Lovecraft's stories or style, this is a perfect start as you don't need any background - it is all self-explanatory.  It is a mystery, sci fi and horror all wrapping into one ball of goodness and takes you on a roller coaster ride from start to finish.  It kind of reminds me of Twilight Zone or the Outer Limits, because much of Lovecraft eventually became many plots in those shows.  Filmed on location in Vermont, set during the Vermont Floods of 1927, the film's release coincidentally came during the Vermont Floods of 2011.  The filmmakers pitched in to help the great people of Vermont recover from the disaster.  This is the second effort of the filmmakers, the first being The Call of Cthulhu.  It was a new, old-style silent film and won critical acclaim.  This is on the same track, winning awards and acclaim, and in my opinion, is a much more engaging film.

The actors are also top notch.  Matt Foyer is an amazingly expressive actor and does a perfect job portraying Albert Wilmarth.  He brings such a real human element (which you rarely if ever see in horror) you can't help but get drawn in.  Barry Lynch creates both one of the creepiest scenes in horror history without blood, gore or anything but his voice and yet also manages to create one of the most heart-wrenching and human scenes I've seen in the genre.

If you at all love great classic horror films, ones that don't rely on grossing you out, but give a great ride with your mind like Dracula, Frankenstein or the Mummy, then do yourself a HUGE favor and pick this one up.",1324512000,49,2025,4.4324324324324325
5003514,5,B006LMRMMA,"High quality Lovecraftian movies are in short supply.  Most of us agree that The Thing by John Carpenter is the best overall Lovecraftian movie.  Straight up adaptations of HPL are even rarer.  Not surprising, as most of HPL's works are rather wordy and cerebral, with little in the way of action or human interaction to hold interest on the screen, and all those unfortunately indescribable creatures.  Previously, with The Call of Cthulhu, The HP Lovecraft Historical Society showed that this is an art best left to those who are true fans of these stories (I include Mr. del Toro and regret the shelving of At the Mountains of Madness as much as anyone).  Well now the bar has been set even higher.  The Whisperer in Darkness is by any account a resounding triumph.  I would even say it deserves a nod at the Oscars for adapted screenplay, although that will never happen.  A larger studio may have had a bigger budget or marquee stars, but there is no way anyone could have made a better film.

Of course this movie is an *adaptation* so it is not exactly the same as the novella/short story on which it was based.  I think the changes and compromises wrought by the screen play authors Sean Branney and Andrew Leman do a superb job of conveying the Lovecraftian cosmicism and the important aspects of the story, while allowing the film to work as a piece of cinema.  They added some human interest, by introducing a young girl, the daughter of one of Akeley's neighbors, and also gave the work some thrilling action sequences.

The creature effects by Jason Shulman, Chris Peterson and Jon Gourley merit special praise.  On a shoestring budget they developed Mi-Go that are terrible to look at and fascinating to watch.  Wisely the director does not tip his hand by revealing the Mi-Go too soon.  The use of black and white photography allows for lighting and cinematography with a period feel.  Atmospheric music by Troy Sterling Nies marvelously enhances the tension.

I think all of the performers were wonderful. Too bad Matt Foyer won't receive any special awards for his incredible and believable performance as Wilmarth.  I think child actress Autumn Wendell as Hannah deserves particular kudos, as does Caspar Marsh as Hannah's father and Andrew Leman as Charles Fort (in fact the entire sequence in Arkham had me shaking my head in appreciation for the talents of the entire cast and crew).

I have read HPL's story countless times and yet I was absorbed from the opening sequence to the ending credits.  I think anyone who loves thoughtful horror or science fiction could find much to appreciate here, even those who are unfamiliar with Lovecraft or who have never heard of HPL's story.

As I said, this is a resounding triumph, an achievement for the ages.  All of us are in debt to the HPLHS.  I cannot wait to see what they do next.  I only regret there was no widespread distribution on the big screen.  Maybe this can gets run on an adventurous cable channel to give it the exposure it so richly deserves.  Bravo to all.",1324252800,52,3040,4.7102272727272725
5003515,4,B006LMRMMA,"I was pleasantly surprised. The actors were solid, the presentation quite apt, and I definitely appreciated the homage to the old b&w films that were of a kind with HPL's eldritch writing. Good job on a low budget.

5003525,2,B006LMRMMA,"The Whisperer in Darkness is one of my favorite Lovecraft stories. It was the first long story of his I read that really got to me, with perfect descriptions of things that helped set the tone. While it didn't scare me, how some things were described lingered in my mind and still do today, 12 years after I first read it. When I found out that the people responsible for the great Call of Cthulhu short film were going to tackle it for their next movie, I got excited and couldn't wait to see how they did key scenes, and how they were going to handle the Mi-Go creatures. At the same time, I was a bit worried because the filmmakers were determined to keep it faithful to how movies wouldve been made at the time of the storys release. I can understand that they may have wanted to do it this way to keep it in with the spirit of Lovecraft, but why not just try and make a movie like you normally would without the gimmick?

If you're on this page, theres a good chance you're familiar with the story on which the movie is based on. If not, Ill give a little plot summary. A historic flood in Vermont has caused odd things to surface, which many claim to be the legendary monsters that live in the hills, taking people away if they come too close. Albert Wilmarth, an instructor of literature, writes back and forth to Henry Akeley, someone who claims to know what the creatures are, and even has his son give Wilmarth photos and other proof of their existence. After being embarrassed by Charles Fort in a debate about the existence of such things, Wilmarth heads out to meet with Akeley to see what exactly is going on, as they're said to attack his home from time to time. As soon as Wilmarth arrives in town, hes greeted by a strange man, and things get weirder once he makes it to Akeleys home.

I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I knew it would be hard to adapt accurately because so much of the story is an exchange of letters between Wilmarth and Akeley. They did a good job doing what they could with the first half, introducing new characters to cram the storys info into, using them as quick ways to move the plot along. That, I understood. Its the second half of the film though, where things fall apart big time. For whatever reason, they decided to change a bunch of things, including what happens between Wilmarth and Akeley, and the ending is drastically changed. And here I thought these guys wanted to be as faithful to Lovecraft as they could be. Some of the changes were downright embarrassing too, including one scene that has Wilmarth climbing through a lab in a cave where a painful amount of time is spent. And just wait until you see the big plane escape. Its weird because once Wilmarth arrives at Akeleys, thats where the story really picks up. Here, it gets boring, lacking any suspense. Akeleys whispery voice sounded too fake and enhanced, and what killed me was when one of the Mi-Go brain canisters is hooked up, the audio of the person talking has them talking like a regular person. In the story, this was the part that creeped me out, with Lovecraft explaining the electronic sound of the voice. I imagined an electric voice like what youd hear over a police radio, but lacking any emotion.

They also opted to animate the Mi-Go using CG instead of doing it with stop motion. This makes sense because stop motion takes so long to do, and with their budget and the amount of people working on the movie, it wouldve taken ages to do. Still, the CG designs were disappointing, mainly because they looked so smooth and clean. I also noticed some errors with the audio, where select dialogue from a character would be louder than that of another characters in the same scene. My other big issue is that some scenes were ruined by actors hamming it up for the camera, although Im assuming they did that to be like actors in the 30s. One stuck out like a sore thumb- Stephen Blackehart, who plays Charlie Tower. I -could not- stand this guys delivery and cringed when hed show up a few times later on in the movie. Everything about his performance is so forced.

I don't recommend this to anyone unless you're a die hard Lovecraft fan with low standards. When I looked on message boards for this movie after watching it, I couldn't believe how many people were criticizing those who didn't like it, saying the usual lines like if you don't like it, lets see you make something better. You never hear that from the same people when they see a bad movie, like say Alien vs Predator- they just accept that its a bad movie and move on. This was the first big adaptation of The Whisperer in Darkness, and it fell flat. There are plenty of people who couldve done better with the same budget, and a lot more passion. Like I said earlier, why bother trying to make the movie like a 1930s movie when you couldve done just as good, if not better, filming it like you would film any other movie? Better acting, better musicthis whole thing just felt like a forced attempt. Hopefully if they decide to make another movie, more effort is put into it.",1447977600,5,5077,4.43254817987152

Unlike some recent attempts to recapture that spirit, yes you Tales of Dracula and you House of the Wolfman, this one is tightly written, and faithfully brings out the spirit of Lovecraft.  The only shame is that the only other movie they have put out is its predecessor Call of Cthulhu, which I also recommend.  A real delight.",1441497600,3,491,4.373626373626373
5003529,4,B006LMRMMA,"A great movie if you like the black and white gemre of mythoscope which I don't because it hides too much detail and in my estimation, details add to the feel of the movie. With that said, I would still recommend this film as the plot line is good and I like the main character actor. As I stated in Pickman's Muse colour would have added more interest to the overall feel of the movie and the time length should have been longer, not the typical hour and half length for most Lovecratian genre of films.
I am hoping that the movie for the story of ""At the Mountains of Madness"" gets made by director Del Torro as the trailer looked and felt awesome and this would elevate the Lovecraft novels to a whole new level of entertainment when developed into a movie.
I can see the novel of Call of Cthulhu raised to a trilology of movies that would make it the next Hobbit or Lord of the Rings or Star Wars or Indiana Jones with a director like Spielburg or Cameron or Jackson or Del Torro etc. at the helm.",1441324800,,1001,4.21875

5003536,5,B006LMRMMA,"After owning and enjoying the HPLHS' Call of Cthulhu modern day silent, I had already expected to enjoy Whisperer in the Darkness as well. What I don't understand is why it took me so many years to purchase it.

Expertly written and directed by Sean Branney. Had I not looked him up on IMDB I would have never guessed this was his directorial debut. His natural ability to frame shots and direct actors who have little acting experience is amazing. On a technical level we have here a very well presented story. Lovecraft material can be tricky as he seldom provided a lot of answers and the ones he did provide weren't necessarily lendable to cinema. It takes a lot of talent to pull off. If I recall the story to Whisperer didn't really have much of an ending. The writers on this adaptation did an commendable job doing just that; adapting. The other director I can think of that has done this well is Stuart Gordon. Whisperer in Darkness is that good...Watch out Mr. Gordon.

Aside from its creative liberties towards the final act the rest of the film is true to its source material. Even the final act is true...its like Lovecraft had written an alternate ending and chose not to use it. Very very clever.

Back to the technical aspects. Excellent use of the 'Mythoscope' presentation. Black and White and shot in a way reminiscent of Rod Serling's best Twilight Zone episodes. It really feels authentic and not at all Gimmicky. Acting is solid and believable, as are environments and visual effects.

If you call yourself a Lovecraft fan you have to own this. Watch the trailer, if it entices you that is enough. The trailer doesn't even come close to scratching the service of what delightful ride you're about to embark on.

I would love to see what this team can do with the ""At the Mountains of Madness"" project that will never take off the ground unless die hard HP Lovecraft fans band together and make it thru the HPLHS..",1429920000,,1935,4.597101449275362

Now, they give you ""The Whisperer in Darkness "" again, they did it right.  Akin to  30's Universal horror movie, the film keeps the feel of the times and stays true to the original story.

5003543,2,B006LMRMMA,"Truly dreadful, as both a movie, and as an adaptation of a Lovecraft story.

There will be spoilers in this review. If you've read the story on which this film is based, they won't be surprises, so read on.

A BAD MOVIE
Bad acting pulls you out of the flow of the movie. The acting is so bad in The Whisperer In Darkness, there's never any chance to get an interesting flow going. Strange pauses that make you wonder if someone has forgotten his lines. Actors playing their parts so broadly, so archly, that you wonder if they're trying to steer the movie into farce. Bizarre reactions to events: for example, after Wilmarth learns about the Mi-Go, brains in jars, and other sanity-blasting revelations, he doesn't seem to have any strong feelings at all.

You'll have plenty of time to soak in the bad acting, since this movie is far too long. The script adds characters and scenes that were never in the original story, to pad it out to full movie length. Worse, scenes go on far too long. Need to plug in a brain cylinder to a machine? Why have one plug, when you can have three? That's just a minor example. Even more painful is the long scene of driving to the Aikley farm, with dialogue between the two characters in the car that adds nothing to the story. It reminded me of an old Hercules movie that the Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast mocked for endless scenes of people walking around.

And, dear God, the dialogue...Aside from just being clumsy, the screenwriter also made the mistake of inserting the kinds of phrases that worked on the page, in a Lovecraft story, but sound ridiculous when someone actually speaks them aloud. ""These legend haunted hills"" is a prime example.

A BAD ADAPTATION
And here's where the problems as a Lovecraft adaptation start. First, just putting Lovecraftian elements on the screen, such as Phrases That Should Never Be Uttered By Actors, doesn't make an adaptation. This movie feels less like a Lovecraft tale, and more like a 50s B-movie -- specifically, a lot like It Came From Outer Space, which also featured aliens in a cave, working to some mysterious purpose, bending the local human residents to their will.

The last 25 or so minutes buried whatever hope this movie ever had to capture the feel of a Mythos story. The tacked-on chase, the laugh-out-loud way in which the protagonist foils the Mi-Go plot, the even more hilarious high priest costume...Egad.

As another negative review said, in more detail than I will here, you lose the Lovecraftian feel the moment you show the unearthly, at which point, it becomes mundane. The CGI Mi-Go were a big, big mistake. Better that they remained in the shadows than actually showing them at all. If you have to show them, do it as briefly as possible.

The movie did not scare me, or even give me a shiver of horror. It didn't make me fear that humanity was living a doomed existence in a dark, forbidding universe of ancient evils. In other words, it didn't translate Lovecraft to the screen.",1412985600,7,2993,4.644612476370511
5003544,4,B006LMRMMA,"This film is a labor of love for a group of H.P. Lovecraft enthusiasts, and is one of the best adaptations of Lovecraft's almost impossible to adapt stories.

Not only set in the 1930's, but the film also sports smart 30's style and production design allowing us to forgive some special effects created as if the film was made in the 30s. Performances are serviceable, and a nice Lovecraftian sense of dread is established. Purists may argue with the big ending, but all in all a little gem.",1411776000,,648,4.594827586206897

The stylish black and white cinematography with the appropriate early 1930's time frame was masterful. After sitting through the early 1970's production of ""The Dunwich Horror"", with its interminable scenes of poor Sandra Dee's writhing body double and a wimpily-mustachio'ed Dean Stockwell as her seducer, I was ready for a quality adaptation of one of Lovecraft's stories.

5003557,5,B006LMRMMA,"Growing up, some of the best horror stories I read, the ones that stuck with me long after I had finished the books, were the ones by Lovecraft. He stirred my imagination and his stories were scary, actually scary. I had yet to see that make it's transition to the big screen, until now. Yes, there have been good adaptations, such as The Reanimator (Jeffrey Combs, you rock, you versatile Andorian, Question type guy!), but this is the first movie to bring the utter essence of horror that H. P. Lovecraft could convey to the screen. And I think filming this movie in black and white added to that as well. Like the good old movies of yesteryear (Them! Deadly Mantis, etc.) this movie is big on atmosphere, which so many ""scary"" movies today sadly lack. The Whisperer in Darkness draws you in and gets you interested as it gradually builds up speed, just like Lovecrafts' original stories all do. There is little gore because none is needed. This is a movie I will watch again and again because it is just that good. It is very crisp and clear on blu ray with excellent sound. As a 50 year old horror/sci-fi fan It takes a lot to impress me these days. This film, from these guys, impressed me more than most of the fodder churned out by the big companies. This was obviously a labor of love and it shows. Thanks guys, and I hope The Dunwich Horror  is on your list of movies to make!",1395792000,6,1385,4.389105058365759

Better yet, stream the eye candy, watch it once and move on.

HOWEVER, if you really want to be scared silly by this brilliant writer and the myth he created around the ""Old Ones"" and Cthulhu, do yourself a big favor - go to Amazon ""search,"" click on books (that's the category between ""beauty"" and ""cell phones""), find The Library of America edition of ""Lovecraft Tales"" (ISBN 1-931082-72-3). It'll cost you just about the same as this movie BUT you'll get a beautifully-bound edition of 22 stories of unique content. When you receive it, wait for a dark and stormy night, nuke yourself some popcorn, light a few candles and actually read ""The Whisperer in Darkness."" It's worth the trouble.

5003560,5,B006LMRMMA,"Whisper in Darkness is a great Horror/Scifi Hybrid short story. This adaption was made by, what's essentially a larping community, it's a fan film and a labor of love and I have the highest opinion of it as such. The quality is astonishing considering that it's a fan film with almost no budget, and a far better adaptation of Lovecraft's material than any mainstream or direct to video release I've ever seen (save their other adaptation, the excellent 2005 Call of Cthulthu film). Seriously, this film is working off an extremely small budget, and what they get for it is great.

That's not to say it won't appeal to outsiders. If you like 50's style Scifi it's right in the sweet spot. The only weak point is the monster design (which I'm not nuts about) but they did a perfectly fine job and it all fits in with the mood of the piece. Whisperer feels like a 50's style scifi monster movie, partially because the story it's based on laid the groundwork for that genre. There is some genuine suspense and plenty of atmosphere, as well as a few genuinely sad moments that surprised me. It could have been campy, but the film delivers.

This is a great example of how love and commitment can create great work that others have written off as unfilmable. The truth is Lovecraft isn't un-filmable, it just can't be achieved if you're trying to please a slasher film demographic as well as a Wierd Fiction one (although I know plenty of people who like both) and do so using only the rudimentary echoes of the original stories.

So yes I recommend it, over any Lovecraft adaptation that calls itself such. I will purchase the title if only to encourage them to make more!",1394928000,12,1668,4.5719063545150505

5003567,4,B006LMRMMA,"In their long awaited second foray into feature length film-making, the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has made a credible job of recreating that least cinematic of the master's tales, ""The Whisperer in Darkness.""  I dare say the blu-ray looks better than its budget would imply, and those behind this production have succeeded in bringing the essence of the story to the screen.  The HPLHS set a very high standard with their first effort, a silent version of ""The Call of Cthulhu.""  How does this one measure up?

It looks good.  It doesn't fool me into imagining it as an early '30s film (and I don't allude to fabricated scratches and such, which I would deplore), but I don't require that, and I'm satisfied with camera work, sets, etc.  It comes with a worthy cast, headed once again by Matt Foyer, all of whom seem to know what they're doing pretty well.  The period is beautifully captured.  The fundamental elements of the original story shine through, leading up to the classic confrontation with the Whisperer, which is great.  The producers have seen fit to add an extra act beyond that point, one which provides more action than Lovecraft's largely epistolary piece could do.  I can see the sense in that; thus far purists need not complain.

Three aspects weaken the movie: 1) The directorial style brings out the worst features of method acting, with pregnant pauses and wry glances gobbling up time and dragging out already lengthy dialogue scenes.  These scenes are loosely edited, hesitantly beginning and reluctantly concluding.  A cantankerous editor is needed to appreciably tighten this stuff.  This problem, of course, didn't arise in Cthulhu.  2) Way too much is shown of the Mi-Go.  They become an excuse for heavy-handed CGI, the bane of our age, considerably overdone here.  The Lovecraftian solution is typically more suggestion, less blatancy.  3) Weaknesses in the script, a common problem with independent movies, detract from the whole.  The Charles Fort debate scene is dreadfully tedious, and chunks of the added finale, such as Wilmarth's sudden sappiness, distress me.  The entire escape episode falls flat, with all the suspense building (in violation of Hitchcock's famous dictum) to what was only the likely denouement in the first place.  This should have ended differently, or much sooner.  Again I urge the editor to take charge, for as it stands this movie is 15 to 20 minutes too long.

I rate the film a solid three stars, yet I grant an extra for the magnificent special features that accompany it.  The HPLHS offers more bang for the buck than any source, rivaling or surpassing the best of Criterion.  I was simply entranced by the detailed revelations as to how certain scenes were created.  An incredible amount of work went into The Whisperer in Darkness, with even minor scenes requiring vast amounts of labor and thought.

I hope to see more from these guys.  Whisperer isn't the triumph that Cthulhu was, but I'm sure they have what it takes, and as it stands I prefer the result to the overwhelming majority of Lovecraftian efforts.  Its competency is evident, with excellence demanding only a tad more attention to the ""soft"" factors.  I hope I won't have to wait so long next time!",1389312000,2,3241,4.915285451197054

5003569,3,B006LMRMMA,"HPLS hit a home-run with their 'Call of Cthulhu', by making it a silent movie. It made their use of silent-era effects and acting charming...and, added to the dreamlike effect of having your mind's view of a book come to life.

With 'Whisperer', they opted to make a sound movie...in homage to the Universal 'creature features' of the 1930's. Unfortunately, when you add sound, the increased verisimilitude makes it imperative that sure-handed direction, taut editing, a compelling script, decent effects and solid acting are all present. 'Whisperer in Darkness' misses to some degree on almost all of these...especially acting. Matt Foyer as Albert Wilmarth is the biggest problem here. His entire acting range is limited to mugging, while looking sour, pensive or frightened. In 'Cluthu', that worked very well, as those were the only emotions his character was supposed to register...and, silent movies call for exaggerated facial expressions. In a sound movie, subtle body language is key, along with coordinated use of voice and facial expressions.
Martin Wately as Walter Brown is another key offender...broadcasting his vile character's intentions with all the subtlety of Snidely Whiplash. The director shares blame for this, as it was his job to keep the performances of his actors in service to the overall tale. Its a shame, because most of the supporting cast does a terrific job with their characterizations.

The script works rather well for the first two acts...when they are following Lovecraft's original tale. However, the tacked-on third act suffers from having Wilmarth suddenly transform from a clueless dick, into Dick Tracy. Suddenly, he follows clues, makes discoveries, thwarts the villains...and, even knows how to fly a bi-plane! Other than the fact that none of it jibes with his character up to that point, its just dandy. In addition, a young girl is added to the story/script as a very weak deus ex machina, to shore up the poor writing...then, quickly killed off.
Oh, about that bi-plane flight: It added nothing whatsoever to the narrative...other then padding the film's running time; and, the opening credits of Mystery Science Theater 3000 can boast much better effects. The laugh-ability of the scene was exacerbated by flaccid editing; so, what should have been the script's highlight turned into yet another 'jumped shark'.
If I sound harsh, its because there was so much to admire and enjoy in the first two acts of 'Whisperer'. Even the off-key performances were tolerable in light of the spooky tale being well-told. However, the third act took what should have been a memorable new-old spookfest, and made it merely mediocre.",1386201600,12,2668,5.202325581395349

5003579,3,B006LMRMMA,"H.P. Lovecraft's story from 1930, is brought to life in a fairly faithful manner, involving some of the folks from the HPLHS, who also brought to life (albeit in a silent manner) the authors most famous story, 'The Call of Cthulhu', a few years ago.

'The Whisperer in Darkness' is one of the best of Lovecraft's stories and one of the best known too and this low budget B+W effort remains close to story for the most part, but veers off around the last 3rd, mostly for dramatic purposes, according to the makers. It's a given that Lovecraft is a difficult author to put on the screen faithfully and the vast majority of efforts fail terribly. In fact the only screen efforts that have come close have been this and the aforementioned 'The Call of Cthulhu', both of which have been produced (in part anyway) by folks who ""get"" the author.

The short story is typical Lovecraft fare. A bookish professor (and skeptic) Albert Wilmarth, from the Miskatonic University, ventures out to the Vermont countryside to meet with a man called Henry Akeley (with whom he has been in contact with), to discuss the strange beings that Akeley says are surrounding his farmhouse. Once at the farmhouse, Wilmarth's skepticism is broken down as he discusses the situation with a sickly Henry Akeley.

For those who are unfamiliar with H.P. Lovecraft, this film will probably not be to their taste, as it's very slow moving and like a lot of Lovecraft's stories, takes a long time to burn. It's also set in the 1920's (as it should be) and that'll no doubt turn a lot of people off too. It's B+W attempt to capture a 1930's movie feel will also be another notch against it, I think.

But for people who are fans of the author, this has a lot to offer, at least for the first 2 thirds of the way. The producers have seen fit to add a 3rd act that chronicles what happens after Lovecraft's original story ends. This has its benefits and its drawbacks. On the one hand, it makes for a slightly better film experience, but on the other it takes the original story off on a tangent that could put Lovecraft readers on a negative footing.

However, considering that every book that's ever been put onto screen, since the dawn of the medium, has been altered, I'm inclined to give the producers of 'The Whisperer in Darkness' a pass. Also, their alterations are of a far less destructive nature than some. The upcoming Brad Pitt vehicle, 'World War Z', being a prime example.

'The Whisperer in Darkness' is certainly not for everyone, it's not even for every Lovecraft fan, but considering the budget that the film makers had to work with, they've produced a very commendable effort here.

3 1/2 stars",1359676800,7,2676,4.609243697478991
5003580,3,B006LMRMMA,"After the brilliant masterpiece that was ""Call of Cthulhu"" I had high expectations for the HPLHS production of ""Whisperer in Darkness.""  Those hopes were miserably dashed.
I got excited when the anti-piracy warnings came up with retro typography and old-film exposure flicker - but when the movie started I was appalled to see that no effort had been made to give it a ""vintage"" surface treatment.  Sure, they used retro fonts for the titles, and all the props and costumes were period-appropriate .. but this did not look like an OLD movie.  It looked like a made-for-TV period drama.  The black & white was too crisp, the editing techniques were not vintage, and there was far too much location shooting.  All you have to do is watch about three movies from the 1930s to know that movies of that era were shot on soundstages, NEVER on location.  And the sound was too pristine; none of the dirt and fuzz and crackle you'd get from an optical soundtrack or an electro-mechanical recording from that era.  I was sickened, after the illusion of authenticity created in ""Call,"" to see that illusion shattered in ""Whisperer.""  Obviously the filmmakers know how to do this right, because the pre-production promotional short (included on the extras disc) looks AWESOME.  That was the movie I was hoping to see.  I wish whoever had made that short had stuck around to do the feature two years later...
And then there's the story.  HPL's original short story is here, surrounded by a thick gooey envelope of Hollywood shmaltz.  There was no little girl in the story.  There was no aerial dogfight.  Wilmarth did not meet the Mi-Go.  There was no ritual.  The story ends when Wilmarth finds Akeley's face and hands, and flees terrified into the night.  That's where the movie should have ended.  I was appalled, after being so proud of the HPLHS for _FAITHFULLY_ bringing ""Call"" to the screen exactly as Lovecraft wrote it, that they would turn around and trample his work underfoot in their second foray.  The writers make excuses for themselves in the ""making of"" documentary included in the extras:  They claim that it was necessary to add a ""third act"" and give Wilmarth some ""emotional interest"" in order to make the story properly ""cinematic.""  I cry foul!  If the story works on paper, why wouldn't it work on the screen?  Who made the rule that states a script must be burdened with at least three worn-out movie cliche's in order for it to ""work"" as a movie?  I was sickened when I saw this play out in the movie, and angered when I saw the writing duo blithely defend it as if they were not guilty of a heinous literary crime.  Honestly, when Wilmarth offered to sing the little girl a song to bolster her spirits, THAT was the only moment of true horror for me in the entire movie.  (SPOILER:  The girl says ""no"" thereby saving the viewer 25 points of sanity and making her the true heroine of the whole loathsome tale.)  Oh, and why does the Mi-Go completely ignore Wilmarth after literally *bumping into him* skulking around at the ritual?  That made no sense.
And how about the effects?  Oh yeah, the Charles Fort makeup was impressive, and I'm not complaining about that.  But we weren't supposed to see the Mi-Go.  Showing us the monster ruins it.  Lovecraft himself could tell you this .. when asked if he would ever put out a definitive text of the Necronomicon, he said no, because actually reading it would destroy the mystery and make it NOT SCARY anymore.  We should not have seen the monsters.  Why were they wearing monocle helmets?  Why did they look like plucked chickens with lobster claws?  Having them beautifully CG-animated only makes their inadequacy more laughably apparent.  Dark, blurry, out-of-focus, or out-of-frame would have been the proper way to present them.  No monster closeups, no monster shots longer than 2 seconds, and for the love of humanity, NO MONSTER DIALOGUE!  The filmmakers broke all these rules.  You should never show the monster, because it is inevitably going to look dumb, and not as scary as the viewer thinks it should be.  These things got WAY too much screen time to be taken seriously.
The acting was, overall, good.  Old Akeley was excellent, and the slick-talking Bostonian who drove the car was delightfully oily.  Wilmarth was an intolerable douchebag for most of the film, and he gets really extremely creepy (in a bad, uncomfortable way) when he starts fawning over the little girl, later on.  Neither of these are directions I would have taken that character if it was up to me, but I've got to admire the actor's chops to pull all that off in a soaking wet cardigan.
In summary, I'd have to say this is a toss-up.  Serious Lovecraft fans might want to avoid it because it betrays the source material in an inexcusable way.  Horror movie fans will consider it a waste of time because it is slow, pretentious, and JUST NOT SCARY.  But if you like schlocky B movies you _might_ find a place in your heart for this one.  If you thought the HPLHS's ""Call of Cthulhu"" was the best Lovecraftian film you have ever seen (as I did) you must avoid this movie the same way you would avoid a circle of stones on a lonely New England hilltop.

Most obviously there is the challenge that the Things That Should Not Be are by design indescribably horrible, so much so that one's mind may be rent merely by seeing them, so getting them on camera in a convincing way is problematical, as so many previous attempts have so convincingly demonstrated.

Then again, some of the stories really don't stand the test of time and today's jaded audience expectations will drive the director, scriptwriters and editors to tweak the results until they bear little to no relationship to the parent material.

With this in mind I was not expecting to be so thoroughly impressed by this HPLHS production even though I had been truly knocked for six by the previous effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Call-of-Cthulhu-The-Celebrated-Story-by-H-P-Lovecraft/dp/B000BQTC98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Call of Cthulhu: The Celebrated Story by H.P. Lovecraft</a>&nbsp;(which was brilliant in concept and execution).

The conceit of ""Mythoscope"" is that the techniques used to film a story should be evocative of the period in which the story was written in and about. Thus we have a black and white movie here, with rather basic rotoscope sequences (technically: in execution they are gripping, clever and entirely worth seeing) and that newest of kinescope innovations: sound! One must of course ensure that family members of sensitive disposition are not unduly startled by this triumph of technology.

The story is well told, with minor but well-taken alterations in the script to accommodate the medium and to address some rather obvious inconsistencies. I like to think that Lovecraft would have made the same changes had he had the chance to see his story filmed.

The special effects are convincing, very much so. Miniatures blend seamlessly with live action to give startling results. The machines are not what I always imagined them to look like but I like what they did with the ideas very very much.
And there is one makeup effect to accommodate a slight change in approach to a story plot element that is absolutely amazing. I almost fell off my chair when I saw it.

The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles, especially Wilmarth, Akeley and Hannah Masterson (a character added to the story to allow a rather better ending to the story than the original from a movie perspective - part of the included documentary footage explains the thinking on this and I find I agree wholeheartedly with it and the results speak for themselves). The quality of the acting in this film was an order of magnitude higher than I was expecting and serves me right for having no faith in the HPLHS.

The monsters, in keeping with the Mythoscope regimen, were to have been filmed using stop-motion, but due to time and cost issues ended up being realized by CGI. The production team involved went to some effort to make the results *look* like stop-motion animation in quality, and on the whole this works well. As for the monsters themselves, they are much better than anyone else with less sympathy for the canon might achieve if not strictly what I would have expected from my long hours watching them at work in the pages of various collections. I was impressed.

Five stars doesn't really express how well I think the team did with this story. The effort must have been stupendous at every level to have pulled it off so well. Given the nature of the story the appeal will no doubt be limited, but I venture to suggest if you can get older teens to sit through the build-up they will still end up shuddering in horror, cheering for the good guy and ... nope, sorry, no spoilers. Don't want to ruin your enjoyment.

If you are a fan of Lovecraft you won't be disappointed unless you are of the school of thought that says no change to the original work can be justified.

Support the HPLHS in their efforts to bring Lovecraft's work to the screen in a way he might very well have applauded could he see the results. Buy this movie.",1350518400,4,4114,4.973799126637554
5003588,5,B006LMRMMA,"I really respect the HPLHS for their work. They make films, radio adaptations and various other H. P. Lovecraft adaptations. I fell in love with their Call of Cthulhu adaptation first (Best silent film since the 20s... until The Artist came out). I had high expectations for this and I wasn't disappointed.

It seems fitting that their first film was a silent picture, as they have now moved into the realm of early talkies. The picture is still shot in glorious black and white and the creatures are the sort Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of. The entire film is a labor of love and it shows in every scene. A good portion of the film is a rather faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's story, but a twist comes and manages to fill out the entire film with new material. As a purest, I was afraid how this would go, but my fears were unfounded. The writers of the film knew how to handle Lovecraft and the new material feels true to the original.

All in all, this is a good fun film. Recommended for Lovecraft fans and those who love classic horror cinema. Can't wait to see what the next adaptation will be!",1349136000,2,1112,4.446078431372549

5003591,3,B006LMRMMA,"I'd love to give this production a higher rating, because, if you never read the short story by H.P. Lovecraft, you'd love the movie. However, the HPLHS, which claims to want to do films faithful to the content of Lovecraft's stories, doesn't do that here. There was no brave little girl in the original story. There was no dramatic tossing of the cylinder with Akeley's brain into a pool. There was no biplane scene. There was no creature dogfight. In fact, the very first sentence in the original story reads, ""Bear in mind closely that I did not see any actual visual horror in the end."" This is the crux of HPL, not what you see, but what your mind's eye sees. Dark imagination.

Other drawbacks was the obvious tabletop 'forest' and phoney cave entrance. The black and white seemed too artificial, too smooth, unlike any black and white film of the 30's or 40's. May as well have filmed it in color, since any attempt at a classic 30's look pretty much failed.
I wasn't impressed by the casting of the lead character either. He seemed out of character for the stuffy, intellectual, blue-blooded scientific skeptic that H.P. Lovecraft's character Albert N. Wilmarth, Esq. was supposed to be.
Admittedly, the Henry W. Akeley character was very well done, and his hissing laugh and ghastly countenance was unnerving. Had there been a little girl in the original short story, then that casting and acting would equally be a plus. But there was no such character. Instead of being faithful to the creator of the story, and to themselves, the producers of the film 'took a dive' and betrayed HPL, his fans, and themselves for a hokey airplane dogfight-with-the-creature ending, and a politically correct insert with pigtails. After such a long wait, that is what we got. Make the lead character a black woman professor and I'm sure they would have a wider distribution and marketing coverage.

There will be those who read this who will disagree with me of course. They will say to sell a film today you must compromise, you must have garish action, you must inject a female role model to be inclusive of all into today's 'equal' society.

While not as true to the original HPL tale of horrible science fiction, the Whisperer in Darkness does a wonderful job of presenting the Old Man's story to modern film buffs. On BD, the first thing you notice is an enchanting score in 5.1 surround and a hauntingly lit stage that is frightfully stark in contrast and detail. The images are almost ""too real"". The original story ends abruptly, and so the HPLHS took it upon themselves to make the story a bit longer with a bit more of an emotional, dare I say, 'heroic' ending (something that never happens in a HP Lovecraft story).

For the uninitiated, the plot involves a linguistics and folklore scholar taking a trip into rural Vermont on a quest to find definitive truth behind what amounts to a rash of 'alien sightings'. Over the course of the tale, the protagonist begins to uncover bit by bit, mostly due to a shut-in farmer who has seen a bit too much of the truth. For the fans, the ending is FAR removed from the original while remaining very much in vein and intent as possible. No spoilers here. Sorry. But the Mi-Go... pretty well done, and afforded a lot more on-screen time than the high priest of R'lyeh.

The BD itself has a tonne of extras, most of which are frikkin' hilarious. Lots of behind the scenes and technical details - a lot more than on their previous Call of Cthulhu picture. But there is one glaring omission that I can't forgive:

No subtitles at all. And this is after their first film that had 24 languages.

The sheer effort in the production is incredible and fans anywhere will likely be driven insane from their own enjoyment (unless of course they don't understand English, and then the whole motion picture is lost on them). It leaves us wondering what the crew will try to produce next - the crew comments specifically on Shadow over Innsmouth and the Dunwich Horror, but these suggestions seem more of a wish list.

It has been said by Mr. Lovecraft himself, more than 80 years ago, that no one would be able to film his novels, due largely because it would be too hard to do...That it (his writing) is made to be played in the arena of the mind, as only one's imagination could create the vast vistas of space and the creatures that inhabit it properly. Perhaps this was true in the 1920s, but today, however, that sentiment has been disproven. Though one might expect big-time movie moguls and directors, like Ron Howard, or Guillermo del Toro to tackle HPL's works directly, it was this modest group of devotees; though no less professional or true to the writer's mind-set, to have pulled off a sincere rendition of this classic Lovecraft tale.

5003603,4,B006LMRMMA,"This was a great previously undiscovered Horror talkie from the 1930's in the vein of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman etc except that this movie was based on the books that the legendary H.P Lovecraft wrote (which unknown to Lovecraft were based on his recieving subconscious transmissions from the interspace aether and actually reflect a reality not yet revealed to man.  And as mankind sleeps, let us hope we never wake, as the True Gods await us out there in the darkness).

Now keep in mind, while the previous Call of Cthulhu was a truly frightening nightmarish movie, Whisperer in Darkness is more along the lines of sci-fi horror, so while it's not as scary per se, it is probably more accessible to modern viewers.  And let's face it, when we talk about horror, there are many people who would accept the 'opportunities' offered to them in The Whisperer in Darkness, but but not many of would accept the 'opportunities' offered in Call of Cthulhu.  That right there tells you where the true nightmares lie.

Requires two viewings to fully appreciate, and the first viewing, the 1st section of the movie seemed a little slow, but it didn't seem that way on the second viewing.  While not as good as the silent movie Call of Cthulhu, definately still a cool movie. Looking forwards to the HPLHS' next movie project.  By the way, those describing the movie as 'low-budget' are not getting it, first of all the movie does not 'look' low-budget, second of all, the movie is done in a certain thirties black and white style, it is about the 'intent' of the creators, not about limitations.  * note - movie not actually from the thirties, but any with an appreciation for such will certainly enjoy.  Another note is that they did add a third act onto the story that wasn't in HPL's transcription, while they didn't need to add it and could have set things up to end where the original ended (& simply could have expanded the 1st or 2nd acts), it doesn't harm the movie and is enjoyable regardless.  Bottom line, along with Call of Cthulhu, and Die Farbe, there are now three classic H.P. Lovecraft movies.",1334361600,4,2110,4.693766937669377
5003604,4,B006LMRMMA,"If anyone ought to be able to turn out a decent, relatively faithful cinematic adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story, then it should be an outfit that calls itself the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society and that is precisely what they have done. In fact this is their second film effort following on the heels of 2005's THE CALL OF CTHULHU which was also a first class adaptation. What makes both of these films so remarkable is that they were done on what would today be considered shoestring budgets. It just goes to show what can be done with today's visual technology if you have the necessary skills and vision. A wise and extremely clever decision made by HPLHS was to film both movies as if they were shot in the years that Lovecraft wrote them (1927, 1931). That means that CTHULHU was shot as a modern day silent film (before THE ARTIST) and WHISPERER was shot as if it were an early Universal horror film.

THE WHISPERER IN DARKNESS begins at Lovecraft's legendary Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts (shot at Mount Holyoke College) where we meet professor Albert Wilmarth (Matt Foyer), a skeptical folklore specialist who likes to use science to debunk old myths and legends. After a failed radio show attempt to triumph over a believer in the supernatural (Andrew Leman), he goes to an isolated farm in Vermont to speak with its owner (Barry Lynch) and discovers the type of cataclysmic horror that H. P. Lovecraft specialized in. Fans already know what it is but this review is primarily addressed to those readers who are not familiar with Lovecraft. The film is beautifully made from the opening parody of the old Universal logo (instead of a plane circling the globe it's a zeppelin that crosses over the North Pole) to the period costumes, the old school editing, and an extremely effective soundtrack. The performances by all concerned especially Foyer, Lynch and Autumn Wendel as the young girl Hannah (who is not in the original story) are all you could ask for in an undertaking of this nature. My only reservations, and they are minor ones, are as follows.

1) Every modern day attempt I have seen to shoot a black & white film set in the 1920s and 30's (and this includes THE ARTIST) is clearly shot in color first with the color then removed (HPLHS's MythoScope). This creates a sharp focus picture with harsh lighting instead of a soft focus one with subtle lighting although this was likely done out of budget considerations and is therefore understandable. 2) The rather cynical ending (not Lovecraft's own as the last third is an extension by the filmmakers) would not have occured in a film set in 1931. The tone yes (this would have been a pre-Code movie before censorship clamped down) but not the ending.  From a visual standpoint, however, it is remarkably effective. 3) I would not have shown the creatures in close-up at the end as a lot of Lovecraft's horror deals with the human mind being unable to process what it sees and they didn't match my imagination's depictions of them. Unfortunately, subtlety and discretion are not trademarks of the 21st century.

I offer these observations as a film historian in a purely pedantic way out of a desire to provide some additional background on how films in the 1930s were made, not in an attempt to criticize the film or the filmmakers. I think THE WHISPERER IN DARKNESS and its companion piece THE CALL OF CTHULHU to be minor masterpieces which are truly exceptional when you consider their budgetary limitations (check out the special features on Disc 2 for a true appreciation). I not only look forward to more cinematic endeavors from the HPLHS (so buy this DVD which is available on a made-to-order basis and help to finance their next project) but I wish that other low budget filmmakers as well as big budget ones who attempt to do H.P. Lovecraft would follow in their footsteps.

These guys have captured the spirit of his work and infused it with a great energy, plus a lot of really cool effects and solid (if somewhat mannered) performances.  The hook of this production is not just that it's set in the year the story was published (1931) but that it looks like it was MADE in 1931 - the same year Universal Studios released Dracula and Frankenstein.  The period detail is terrific; all the more surprising as the film was made with little money (but obviously a lot of love and craft).

5003607,5,B006LMRMMA,"It is a strange tradition that indie filmmakers with shoestring budgets inevitably want to make science fiction films. One has trouble discerning why; dramas and comedies are far cheaper and period pieces are just as exotic without the need for special effects. Yet the small film maker continues to pound out high-concept science fiction films regardless of their obvious limitations in this regard.

Then sometimes one of them knocks it out of the park.

The HPLHS already struck gold with Call of Cthulhu, a tremendously faithful 30s expressionist film based on the short story of the same name. With Whisperer they attempt to give a similar treatment to a more narrative Lovecraft story, this time in the trappings of a 1940s talkie. Success in this area is mixed- the feel starts off on target but quickly migrates to the atmosphere of a 60s creature feature... Not that there is anything wrong with that. If anything gives away the film's truly modern nature it is that the photography is a little too clean- again not a problem, and it left me wishing this movie was available on BD as well. The soundtrack is tremendously well done and moody, just like in Call.

Without giving too much away, Whisperer follows the short story faithfully until the end at which point it concludes with an action setpiece not present in the original plot. As if by way of apology, the new ending is actually much more grim than the original, placing the protagonist in a much dimmer situation.

Just as with Call of Cthulhu, the effects here are far better than the film's small scale would suggest. The alien Mi-go in particular are a wonderfully steampunk mashup of creature and clockwork, realized with a very effective mix of models, costuming and CG. Locations are beautifully shot, and the actors fairly douse the production in character- in particular Daniel Kaemon, who plays the cult leader Mr. Noyse, lapses into a fantastic Mid-Atlantic radio presenter accent when he is (unknowingly?) recorded during his dark rituals- it sounds like it should be corny, yet it is eerily effective.

Purists may gape at the liberties taken with the source material, but this is a fantastically solid sci-fi horror flick that is true to the spirit of its source material and for my money far outstrips Lovecraft films with much costlier productions. A must buy if you enjoyed Call, or if you are a fan of old-school horror literature and cinema. This movie proves that epic sci-fi is possible in a small-scale production, and one is left wondering how so many other filmmakers drop the ball.

The Whisperer in Darkness is one of Lovecraft's best tales and the HPLHS managed to overcome some of the inherent problems in adapting it beautifully. Purists however will have a problem with some of the creative license that they took to the story. In the end the changes were done well and remained faitfully to the source material.,1330560000,8,444,4.933333333333334
5003610,5,B006LMRMMA,"I saw this film on the big screen at the Warner Grand in San Pedro, CA at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival in Sept. 2011.  It was the highlight of the festival.  Anyone who loves the 1950s black and white films of this genre will love this movie.  It's not just for Lovecraft fans!  Buy it!",1329350400,5,290,4.125
5003611,5,B006LMRMMA,"In brief, ""Whisperer"" tells the story of Dr. Albert Wilmarth, Professor of Folklore at Miskatonic University and a deep skeptic of the idea that there is anything real behind the legends of strange beings haunting the hill of northern Vermont. When Wilmarth receives an invitation from a regular correspondent in the area, Henry Akeley, to come for a visit to discuss the legends and strange happenings more deeply, he accepts.

And then Very Bad Things happen.

If you like Lovecraft's horror tales and aren't a ""no deviations from the text"" purist; if you enjoy horror movies from the 1930s in the ""Universal style;"" or if you're a fan of well-done independent film-making, I think you'll greatly like ""Whisperer."" Grab a hot dog, popcorn, and coke, sit back, and enjoy.

5003612,5,B006LMRMMA,"There's not much I can say that other reviewers haven't. The work is a labor of love that shows through every second. From the broad sweep to the subtle references, it is near perfect.

There were a couple of plot holes that came from expanding the original story, but those were easily overlooked. Best of all was how the film retains the sense of cosmic wonder interwoven with horror from the story. One has to admit, the Mi-Go's offer is a tempting one, and the creatures fascinate as much as they horrify.

The film makers also made a good choice in placing a lot of humanity in the film. Lovecraft never said human concern don't matter, only that they don't matter beyond humanity.

My only regret is that the show doesn't have a wider audience.

Please, make another and I'll be the first to purchase it!

5003614,5,B006LMRMMA,"I recently purchased this movie and absolutely loved it! The movie is by the same guys (and gals) that made The Call of Cthulhu silent film a few years ago. It is obvious in their finished product that they love and respect the source material from which the story comes from. Too many film directors and authors try to set H.P. Lovecraft's stories in a modern day setting, which I believe takes away from the mood and atmosphere of the original tales. The movie is very faithful to the book other than a few added characters which only help compliment the story. The ending is different from the book, only that it carries on from where the original story left off. It is done so well that it feels like it's a unabridged version of the original tale. I also was very impressed with the vintage feel of the movie. The included making of dvd goes into detail how the filmakers used techniques to make the film feel like it was made during the time period in which the film takes place. I would highly recommend this dvd to anybody who is a lovecraft fan or even a fan of the old universal monsters movies. While you are at it, I would also pick up their other movie The call of Cthulhu. I own both and look forward to their next project.",1327622400,7,1237,4.336206896551724
5003615,5,B006LMRMMA,"I've seen everything I could find drawn from the horror master's works, and this is the finest adaptation to date.

I'd say they were fortunate enough to have the biggest budget and professional film crew so far, but you can still see the care and nurturing that only comes from the touch of dedicated fans of the genre.

Matt Foyer, who starred in the silent film version of 'The Call of Cthulhu', is once more the central character, and primary protagonist of the cultists. His look, his mannerisms and his acting skills, combine to bring this 1931 story - set a few years earlier - to life. The entire cast and look is in fact an homage to the early films of the 30s, depicting the post WW1 era. The clothes, hairstyles, props, sets and locations, are drawn from many familiar movies of that time.

The physical isolation is as real as the mental and emotional, which was a central theme in the tales of Lovecraft set before everyone had a phone, outdoor lighting, roads and someone nearby to offer help - or at least a locked door to hide behind!

As always, this is not a big production film, but the monster effects and settings are by no means cheesy or embarrassing as in some other films. Kudos to the crew that put this together.

There is also a second disc with special features for us dedicated fans.

I look forward to more of these films in the future!",1327104000,6,1367,4.448
5003616,5,B006LMRMMA,"Following up the wonderful Call of Cthulhu, the HP Lovecraft Historical Society now brings us this marvelous slice of shuddersome celluloid - or at least it SHOULD be celluloid. Lovecraft adaptations have always been hit or miss and the good ones have been few and very far between until now. Adding to the strong sense of fidelity to the mood and spirit of the stories is the obvious love and care put into the films and the ingenious decision to film them as they would have been filmed at the time they were written. The results are a total immersion into Lovecraft's peculiar worlds. Whisperer looks, feels (heck it practically smells and tastes) like its 1931 world. Adding to the fun is the second disc of special features and behind-the-scenes footage and helps explain how they do it on what must be shoe-string budgets.

Mostly, though, this is a film that will be cherished by Lovecraftians, film-buffs, horror and suspense fans, and anyone who loves their local Saturday night TV creature feature. This is a movie, like Call before it, to savor over and over again. It will warm you from tentacle to claw.",1327017600,5,1116,4.752577319587629

5003618,5,B006LMRMMA,"Most horror films today are about violence and misogyny. Their fantastic elements are just window-dressing for torture porn. The Whisperer in Darkness reaches back to better days, when horror was an element of fantasy. H. P. Lovecraft's fantasy and science fiction writings have (appropriately enough) a cult following, but this film shows that his stories are accessible to a much broader audience. The H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society made the happy decision to make their own adaptations of HPL stories, and they do it well. Other reviewers have gone into detail; let me just say that I enjoyed the film thoroughly, and would recommend it to others without hesitation.",1325721600,5,673,5.18348623853211
5003619,5,B006LMRMMA,"If you are a H.P. Lovecraft fan, get this. You are committing a crime against yourself if you don't. The Whisperer in Darkness and HPLHS last movie, Call of Cthulhu, are the best H.P. Lovecraft adaptations to date. Where a lot of other attempts failed, this black and white (now with voices!) movie really got that ""Lovecraft"" feeling of dread and terror to it. The actors are awesome, especially Matt Foyer and Barry Lynch. The story was modified a bit there and there to make it a more enjoyable film experience, but I assure you no undescriptible blasphemies were done. I won't go further into it, I don't want to spoil anything.

Also included is a ""Making of"" that is really well done and interesting. It is amazing to see how they did some of the shots with their very low budget.
At the end of it some of the guys talks about making ""Shadow over Innsmouth"" next. Please, I mean, I BEG YOU, DO IT!!! (SoI is my favorite HPL story)

There is a Blu-ray version coming soon, and I will buy it too just to support these guys.
Look, I could go on and on praising this truly epic masterpiece. Just make yourself a favor and get it.

The man from Providence would be very, VERY proud.

5003620,5,B006LMRMMA,"Stories by H.P. Lovecraft have been subjected to many screen adaptations, including ""The Haunted Palace"" from American International (a somewhat faithful but not too great production with a disappointing ending), ""Dunwich Horror"" starring Gig Young in a 70s style horror film that was not even remotely Lovecraftian, ""The Resurrected"" (based on The Case of Charles Dexter Ward) directed by Dan O'Bannon that modernized the time period and invented new characters, ignoring most of the plot, but did manage to create some excellent Lovecraftian scenes especially in the exploration of the monster-infested catacombs under the old house, and probably most notoriously, ""Reanimator"" and ""From Beyond"" by Stuart Gordon which were ultra-gory and more faithful to Davin Cronenberg than Lovecraft.  Essentially throughout movie history, Lovecraft has been ransacked for horror story ideas, rather than carefully and respectfully represented on the screen.

But the H.P Lovecraft Historical Society has done something completely different with their two independent productions, ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and ""The Whisperer in Darkness."" The producer, director and writer have immense respect and love for Lovecraft's style and have gone further than any other filmmakers in creating authentic translations into cinema of the stories.  ""Whisperer"" has some changes and additions, particularly in the ending, but captures the bizarre and vivid imagination of Lovecraft's weird combination of brains in jars, ancient mythic evil, and intelligent insectoid aliens to near perfection. Despite having a budget that would barely pay for lunch on a Tom Cruise film, the money the producers did have is all on the screen with great use of 1930s period props, authentic costumes, nicely detailed sets, atmospheric black and white lighting, imaginative FX and especially the large ensemble cast of fine actors enthusiastically sinking their teeth into their roles - something rarely found in independent films.

If there were any justice in the world of filmmaking, these guys would have at least $100 million for their next production, perhaps the epic ""The Shadow out of Time."" Or maybe ""At the Mountains of Madness"" (a production recently attempted and shelved elsewhere).  I, as a long-time Lovecraft fan, hope they continue making more of the true canon of this great writer's work.",1325462400,10,2365,5.54016620498615
5003621,5,B006LMRMMA,"Whether or not you're a fan of Lovecraft, I strongly recommend that you see this film.  It is as authentic a Lovecraftian film as you'll find.  Very suspenseful, unsettling in mood, and true to the Mythos.  For those familiar with the story, you'll be well pleased - and there are several surprises waiting for you.",1324944000,9,315,4.6909090909090905
5003622,5,B006LMRMMA,"After experiencing the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Societies cinematic take on ""The Call Of Cthulhu"" (2005) I could only have extremely high expectations for their sophomore effort and a few years ago I was enthralled with the teaser trailer and very pleased that their followup choice would be ""The Whisperer In Darkness"" a story rich with mystery, intrigue, suspense and of course bat winged creatures from Pluto. Since a majority of the original story is told through the correspondence in written letters a certain amount of padding had to be utilized to create a working finished product as a film and I have not one single complaint from a fans standpoint, sure they removed Akeley's guard dogs and added a biplane replete with aerial Mi-Go's but it all works splendidly and befitting (through the magic of Mythoscope) of a picture from 1931.

The acting is top notch and I do not use this term lightly, in most cases the heart is in the right place (the lost skeleton of cadavra comes to mind) but falls a little short in the thespian arena when it comes to fans making movies for the fans. Barry Lynch (Henry Akeley) and Matt Foyer (Albert Wilmarth) play their roles flawlessly and convincingly. Will Masterson (Caspar Marsh) and new favorite Daniel Kaemon (P.F. Noyes) also get special kudos for their performances but everyone just did an amazing job right down to Brain Cylinder B-67 (portrayed by producer & director Sean Branney).

Horror Fans, Sci-Fi Fans, Strange Fiction Fans, Fans of the Fantastique and H.P. Lovecraft Fans should all be most pleased with this proper adaptation to the screen of the twentieth centuries greatest, most important writer and architect of All the genres mentioned above.",1324944000,11,1715,4.97212543554007
5003623,5,B006LMRMMA,"The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has done it again with their film adaptation of the classic Lovecraft novel ""The Whisperer In Darkness"".  Remaining faithful to Lovecraft's tales is extremely difficult and has been infinitely expounded upon elsewhere, but this intrepid group of film makers continues to raise the bar for the genre in this the latest of their films.

The ""Call of Cthulhu"" silent movie was an astonishing period piece and well executed, but this film remains even more ambitious.  It's use of ""Mythoscope"", period set pieces, costumes, and especially the props and vehicles (including a beautiful gramophone and Rolls) add an air of authenticity to the suspenseful proceedings, allowing a natural segue from the depiction of the events of Lovecraft's novel to an adaptation that, while continuing in the same vein, displays a refreshing tale of horror not seen since the days of Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.

When considering a Lovecraft movie, I seek well-written and faithful adaptations that still have the ability to invoke concern for the characters, suspense, and horror, even though I am familiar with the tales.  HPLHS has not disappointed with either of their ventures, and heartfelt congratulations are in order for their supreme efforts.  There are many well-done Lovecraftian movies, but few well-done Lovecraft movies, and the films of HPLHS top that very short list.  If you are an aficianado of period pieces, horror movies, Lovecraftian tales, and good old-fashioned independent film-making outside the box, you will certainly find something to appreciate here.",1324857600,9,1606,5.374501992031872

The film has amazing production values and is FAR better than anything being churned out for the movie-plexes. These guys are pros, and they are not fooling around. But most important, they have, for the second time, done what others can't seem to do...they have made a film that is utterly faithful to HPL without falling into the pratfalls of pretentiousness OR camp that others seem to inevitably do. And as is the norm from HPLHS, the second disc is LOADED with extras, making it a bargain. I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Wonderful!!!",1324771200,12,812,4.725352112676056

8500405,5,B006LMRMMA,Often called the best unfilmable horror writer ever most production house fail to keep Lovecraft Lovecraft.  HLPHS gets it from the start and the love (pardon the pun here) shows. The acting is solid and dialogue brings the characters to life in their time and not like  modern people dressed up like it was 1920 something but people dressed and acting like 1920 something was modern. People forget Lovecraft wrote for the most part in his own time while he often look backwards he didn't shade where he was.  Production tried to mimic what film in his era did and again a beautiful compromise  A bit of imagination is required but it actually does raise a chill just as a good print of King Kong from that era does.  I recommend this to Lovecraft fans and Lovecraft curious readers alike.,1511049600,,789,4.607142857142857

8500411,3,B006LMRMMA,"It is OK and it has a few very impressive moments, but overall, this is so far off the rails from the story ""The Whisperer in Darkness,"" that it almost bears no resemblance to it whatsoever.  What the heck is all the third act / fighting the aliens in a crop duster plane all about??? Where did THAT come from?  And that whole conspiracy/ outside the house in the rain, while the ""evil"" aliens plot to open some kind of secret door to another world -- that is NOT in the original story at all.  If you're going to change the entire last half of the story, then you're not doing an adaptation of it you're doing a completely different story altogether.  This one emphasizes the sci-fi elements much more so than the horror elements -- so it actually IS Lovecraftian in the sense that it can be read as weird pulp fiction sci fi (which is how this movie reads it) but I'm still waiting for an adapation of the actual story, which is more horror than sci fi.  The story is one of Lovecraft's most chilling with an absolutely horrifying ending.  So if you want something close to the actual story, this is not it.  I think the photography and directing is great and very crisp here, so nothing to complain about there.  Just what the heck were they trying to achieve with this??",1481500800,,1274,4.36864406779661
