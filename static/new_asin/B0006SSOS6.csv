8042731,3,B0006SSOS6,"It's great to have this wonderful movie available in ANY form, and with English subtitles, but I wish someone would release it in its original 2.35:1 widescreen version. Amazon confuses the issue even more by saying that this DVD's Format is ""Full Screen"" (ie, 1.33:1) but that its Aspect Ratio is 1.85:1. The awful truth is that it is indeed full-screen - without letter-boxing - so almost half of the glorious wide image is chopped off the sides to fill a 1950s-type, almost square TV screen that isn't even manufactured any more.

So this DVD is worth buying just to see the terrific movie, but we're NOT seeing it as it was filmed. We get most of the action, but none of the beauty.

(NOTE: Since Amazon likes to lump all reviews of a title together regardless of the particular format the reviewer is reviewing, at some time in the future this review may become quaintly irrelevant. If that happens, please understand that I am not an idiot; I just wasn't as lucky as later purchasers were who got the widescreen version.)",1425081600,,1027,4.637362637362638
8042732,4,B0006SSOS6,"Corruption exists on many levels. While Argentine cinema is certainly full of films about exposing institutional corruption, what makes Caballos Selvajes so moving is its focus on the personal choices of individuals in contributing to or avoiding corruption. The decision a young banker instinctively makes when confronting a life, death and money situation sets him on a path which irrevocably veers him away from becoming like his corrupt boss at the bank. Likewise that of an ambitious young journalist contrasts him sharply with his calculating and corrupt boss at the network.

Protecting human life, human expression, human freedom, and the truth is a theme which runs through this film. The consequences of making choices based on these priorities are often not easy, and that is reflected in the outcomes for these characters. The wild horses of this film are a metaphor for human freedom, and what must be done to insure their freedom, an example of hard but worthwhile sacrifice.",1216339200,3,989,5.18125
8042733,5,B0006SSOS6,"This is not the only Argentinean production in which you can watch the tandem Alterio-Sbaraglia, and the reason for this is that the formula works perfectly. Just putting these two actors together in a room with an average script will result in a good movie, but when you add Cecilia Dopazo and a great script to the mix, the results are spectacular.

It all starts with Jose (Alterio) walking into a bank and threatening to kill himself unless Pedro (Sbaraglia) gives him the money he is asking for. But this is not a typical bank robbery, because Jose is only asking for the amount of money they stole from him when the bank declared bankruptcy and changed its name. He justs wants $15,344, but in his nervousness Pedro grabs a lot more than that and then leaves the bank with the old man as his ""hostage"".

And then, a beautiful journey starts, as the anarchist and the yuppie head south, with the police, the mafia and and uncompromising journalist (Fernan Miras) following their trail. A big part of the plot has to do with Pedro's doubts having to do with the contrast between the corrupt system in which he lived until now and the new world this wonderful renegade is showing him. Add to this Ana (Dopazo), a conflicted young woman who will contribute to Pedro's confusion, who will change the lives of our two main characters forever, and you have a hell of a movie.

If you really dislike films with a lot of cursing, you may have an issue with this one. But the amazing story, excellent performances, and cleverly selected music will do it for most people. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be amazed and overall, you will have a wonderful time.",1186099200,3,1660,4.563758389261745
