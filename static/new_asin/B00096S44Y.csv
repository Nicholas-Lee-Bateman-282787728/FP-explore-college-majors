8200973,4,B00096S44Y,"Charlie was a great British gangster movie based on a real life British gangster. The British are finally getting it together with their gangster movies. Instead of making ""American type"" of gangster movies they are making British type of gangster movies. These are far more interesting and entertaining. One of the earliest British gangster movies that was and still is an excellent stand out is, ""The Long Good Friday"". Its a ""Don't Miss "" movie with the great late Bob Hoskins and a very hot Helen Mirren. Also, look for a very young Pierce Brosnan in a small but pivotal role. A real must have for the gangster movie section of every movie lover's library",1421020800,,659,4.739130434782608
8200974,3,B00096S44Y,Good cover with picture and it's a good DVD however it freezes a lot at the end of DVD. Will keep it.,1392163200,,101,3.6363636363636362
8200975,5,B00096S44Y,Charlie was a well acted movie. Worth it if you enjoy a good movie but warning it is violent. But it about a criminal.,1381536000,,118,3.9583333333333335
8200976,4,B00096S44Y,"A great depiction of the infamous Charlie Richardson, noted gangster of the 1960's London scene. Luke Goss shows that he did his homework before stepping into the shoes of such a character.
Enjoyed the movie, language was a bit of a barrier the first time I watched the movie - but by the second and third time I viewed this movie, I feel as if I could recite some of the more noteworthy lines verbatim.",1355443200,,403,4.386666666666667
8200977,3,B00096S44Y,"I wanted to see this movie after seeing the trailer on line, thought it would be at the least entertaining. Let me start with the highlights of the movie Luke Goss does a great job as Charlie getting you to understand the complex nature of this not so sympathetic character from early childhood to adult you get a feel of how Charlie ends up the way he does and it's a pretty wild ride at that ! The one problem I had was the extremely heavy accents made it very hard to follow the dialogue and this got a little better as the movie progressed. Luke Goss's  portrayal of Charlie Richardson was the only highlight of this movie he was gorgeous yet sinister , all in all it was worth the money paid-",1302048000,2,697,4.2406015037593985
