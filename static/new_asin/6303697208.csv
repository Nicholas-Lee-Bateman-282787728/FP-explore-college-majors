7853534,4,6303697208,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS VIDEO! I WAS AMAZED BY THESE TALENTED MEN AND THEINTENSITY WITH WHICH THEY SING - AND CUT UP! THIS VIDEO, I BELIEVE PORTRAYS IN A TRUTHFUL WAY HOW VERY  DEDICATED PAVAROTTI, CARRERAS AND  DOMINGO ARE TO THEIR CRAFT. HAVING SEEN CARACALLA IN ROME MYSELF, IWISH I  COULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THIS EVENT, AND THE ""THREE TENORS  ENCORE"" BRINGS IT INTO MY LIVINGROOM. WHO IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST  TENOR? THAT WOULD BE ANYONE'S GUESS..WHO IS THE BEST COMEDIAN OF THE  THREE?WHY, CARRERAS, OF COURSE!THEY ARE DEDICATED MEN, BUT ALSO KIDS HAVING  THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES WITH ZUBIN MEHTA AT THE HELM. THIS VIDEO IS WELL  WORTH THE PRICE! VERY ENTERTAINING!",961027200,8,673,4.791304347826087
