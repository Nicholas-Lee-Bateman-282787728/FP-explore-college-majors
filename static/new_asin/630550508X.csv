1043359,1,630550508X,"What a wretched, wretched movie is GOD'S GUN.  A promising plot is ruined by inept direction, over-exposed film and an under-exposed Sybil Danning.

 An otherwise competent cast is wasted and embarrassed in this one.  Jack Palance, who plays the villain most effectively the less he talks acts like a hyperkinetic speed freak.  Richard Boone, who usually earned half his salary with his voice and great, braying, sarcastic laugh, is dubbed by a voice actor!  In fact, everyone in GOD'S GUN is dubbed by someone else, which is a mystery.  The only explanation I can imagine is that the international cast were presenting such a polyglot of languages that the film makers decided to record the dialogue track after the film was in the can and the original actors were no longer available.

 The only good thing in GOD'S GUN is the final scene showdown between Palance and Lee van Cleef.  Unfortunately it's unlikely that a majority of viewers will stick around this stinker long enough to see it.",1094601600,12,994,4.863095238095238
1043360,1,630550508X,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen (right below ""Green Slime""). Ever a big Richard Boone fan: he is forgiven in this movie. Jack Palance: not believable, no matter what role except ""City Slickers"" where his persona, a dead cowboy playes true. Lee Van Cleef ever steely eyed, ever smooth talking is the only reason to see this film. The downfall, and major blunder, was to cast an amature (immature) to the film: preteen hearthrob Leif Garret. ""Thankfully"" throughout the video he is a mute boy but his acting skills, I give this flick a 1",1053734400,4,551,4.52
1043361,5,630550508X,"What's wrong with you people??? This was a great all round Spaghetti Western!!! Sure, it may not rate up there with ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" or the other two of the trilogy, but it is nonetheless a very good movie. Lee Van Cleef plays a great dual role of the priest (Father John) and the twin brother gun-slinger (Lewis), Sybil Danning (Jenny) is flat out beautiful and Leif Garrett is plays a very believable Johnny son of Danning. Oh, and lets not forget Jack Palance as the very bad Sam Clayton. All these characters blend together to make a very memorable movie. One the better scene's in the movie is when Johnny is trapped in the church bell tower and he takes a metal bolt and flings it at his pursuer hitting him in the head, causing him to go head over heals to the ground below. I also enjoyed the wonderful dancing lady in the Saloon. Sante Maria Romitelli produced a sound track equal to anything Ennio Morricone ever did and Orlando Signorelli did an equally good job in editing the film. This is one of my all time favorite Spaghetti Westerns and one I would recommend YOU buy.  Forget the prior reviews and buy this movie.",1051660800,8,1145,4.42654028436019
1043362,1,630550508X,"Parolini, directing under the American-friendly name ""Frank Kramer,"" comes up with a film that almost succeeds.
Jack Palance and his gang take over a small town. Leif Garrett and priest Lee Van Cleef stand up to the gang, and Van Cleef is killed. Garrett rides off to find the priest's twin brother, a gunfighter, also played by Van Cleef. They ride back and defeat the baddies.
The film makers give Van Cleef the world's most hideous wig in his scenes as the priest. He and Garrett seem to be competing in a contest for the film's most unappealing hairstyle. Palance, as the outlaw gang leader, must get on his knees every day and thank God ""City Slickers"" came along and rescued his career from messes like this. Sybil Danning, as Garrett's mother, is given little to do but stand around wide eyed, worry about her son, and flash her right breast in a rape scene to be discussed later. Richard Boone, desperately missing John Wayne and the chance to be in his films, plays the stereotypical drunken sheriff who cannot stop the outlaws.
Garrett, who does not sing in this, heads to Mexico to find the gunfighting brother. It takes him just two days, since apparently Mexico is the size of a city block. Van Cleef as the gunfighter is more effective, especially in a clever plan to stop the outlaws by making them think the priest has come back from the dead. The gunfighter does this with the minimum use of guns, and it is entertaining.
The bad news? Ennio Morricone should sue the composer here for ripping off ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly""'s soundtrack. Every time Van Cleef is shown, you here that ""aahh"" sound that pops up all time in the superior Sergio Leone film. About an hour into this, the gang tries to rape the judge's daughters. They then go to the saloon and proceed to rape the women there. Then Danning tells Palance he is the father of Garrett, and we are treated to her flashback when Palance raped her years before. I do not know why the majority of modern westerns must feature rape, but this trio of scenes lasts a very long SIX minutes, and seems longer. They are ugly scenes that did not have to be done, and only pander to the lowest form of viewer who needs to have it hit over their head that these are villains, in case all the murders and robberies were confusing.
Parolini finally starts doing some funky things involving his camera with about twenty minutes to go, but it is too late. The baddies are defeated, Garrett learns a big life lesson, and gunfighter Van Cleef rides home.
""God's Gun,"" also known as ""A Bullet from God,"" had a lot going for it, but cannot overcome its own ugliness. I cannot recommend it.
This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, strong sexual violence, gore, some profanity, brief female nudity, brief male nudity, and sexual references.",1022630400,5,2814,4.5853174603174605
1043363,3,630550508X,"I saw this film a few years ago, on a home TV channel, and I thought I had  just entered the twilight zone. I could not believe my eyes! What on earth  was going through the filmmaker's mind as they sat down to green light this  one? The main idea was a passable one, if a little unoriginal, but it was  the execution that went wrong. It is hard to think that both the director  and star of this one were responsible for the excellent 'Sabata' nearly a  decade earlier.
A few highpoints of this film to watch out for:
1. In  the saloon scene, note the whore in the red dress doing a very 'groovy'  dance despite the actual music that is playing. Great arm movement, eh?
2. Another gem is the scene where Lee van Cleef confronts Jack Palance  while they are camped for the night. Was it my imagination, or were the  villains sleeping in the middle of the road? A bit dangerous, isn't it? I  know that they are hardened criminals, their evil posturing has already  alerted us to that fact, but this really is dicing with death.
3. A final  word about the costumes. What happened? Most of the money seemed to go on  the whore in the red dress (a talented dancer) but it seemed that van Cleef  was forced to wear his own trousers for most of the shoot. How can I tell?  The film was made in the late seventies or early eighties and this is  reflected in the circumference of the bottom of his jeans. This is most  noticable in the introduction of the twin brother mid way through the  film.
That said, I have never laughed at an italian western so much in my  life. Go on, buy it.",968803200,7,1576,4.207357859531773
1043364,4,630550508X,"This film is actually quite clever. When I saw it the first time I thought that Lee Van Cleef (the priest) did not have a main role, because he died within the first half an hour. But then his brother (Lee Van Cleef) turned  up and takes revenge on the murderers (Jack Palance etal).
One of the  better Spaghetti Western with a suprise effect. Worth to watch any time.",962928000,3,368,4.318840579710145

1043446,1,630550508X,"God's Gun, 1975 film

The movie starts with a puppet show for children. A gang of men ride into town shooting pistols and entering the bank to rob it. Some men enter a hotel and grab a woman. The townsmen grab rifles and shoot at the gang to protect their local bank (and economy). There are casualties. The gang then rides out of town. Next we see a church and its minister. A young boy wants to shoot a gun. A dozen men ride into town. The saloon has dancing girls and gambling. Young Johnny walks into the saloon. ""This is a respectable place."" A thrown knife stops discord over a card hand. Self-defense? Those dozen men ride out of town. Jenny asks the men to do something about the Clayton gang. That minister decides to ride after them. He disarms them as they sleep in daylight. [Believable?] He invites one back to Juno City. The Sheriff smells trouble in this.

The prisoner in the jail awaits his trial. But his gang comes to town to free him! They shoot that minister. Johnny cries. Clayton is now the leader of the town. Who stole that horse? Three men chase him. One follows him up a tower. A mistake? The gang takes over the town. Johnny visits another town and sees a surprise! Clayton decides to redistribute the loot. We learn about the brother of that minister. Johnny draws a picture to explain. The Marshal and his men ride into Juno City. They are given a story to send them away. The gang double-crosses the judge, then go to the saloon for their amusement. [This won't be shown on broadcast TV.] Clayton laughs. A woman reminds him of his past! Clayton laughs again. A yell from a falling man brings a surprise. ""He's come back!"" The bell on the church tolls. Two men enter the church and regret it. Two more fall into this trap. Clayton calls for Johnny.

A man with a long coat approaches from the end of the street. One man doesn't leave. A dancing girl pays him off. The last man is captured by the Sheriff. Clayton arrives at a cemetery and digs up the loot of paper money. [They used gold and silver for currency in those days. A dropped coin is not blown away by the wind.] He dreams of a happy life ahead. But that minister shows up to surprise Clayton. The bell tolls again. ""Mine is the vengeance."" It ends as you would expect. The bad guy is cured of his wrongdoing. Johnny gets his gun. [So who got the money?]

This is less than average story but it is unintentionally funny in parts. It is a European version of a western adventure story set in the late 19th century. Does it remind you of some story from antiquity or an opera? Note how the actors in some scenes have inappropriate smiles, as if they are amused. The story has implausible parts. Can you identify some actors as European by their faces?",1339372800,,2741,4.379174852652259
1043447,5,630550508X,"I watched this movie before reading the Reviews;and glad I did!.I love Westerns,and Spaghetti Westerns best of all.
 This tale of gunslinging justice takes place in a dusty western town where a priest is ruthlessly murdered while trying to preserve the interests of his community. The marauding gang responsible for the misdeeds did not count on divine intervention ,and the priest's twin brother,who puts his faith in his trusty six-gun and rides into town,to avenge the crimes taking place.
 It's a fast-moving story with lots of violent action and scenes that'll keep you entertained from beginning to end.
  It's a classic struggle of good against evil,where there is no doubt as to where the evil forces lie and  you can count on the good prevailing.
I found all the characters well developed and engaging and there are just the right amount of surprises in store to keep you wondering how this is all going to be resolved. Though it is not a high cost production,it has many great scenes that fully quailfy it as a great Spagetti Western. However;if you are looking for a western where your hero sings to his sweetheart and rides off into the sunset;maybe a Roy Rogers and Dale Evans movie would be more to your liking. Then again, if you are a Sergio Leone ,Clint Eastwood,Jack Palance, Lee Van Cleef and Spaghetti Western fan,this is your kind of movie.",1328832000,4,1361,4.799145299145299

1043451,1,630550508X,"As huge fans of ""spaghetti westerns,"" my husband and I were thrilled to find one we'd never seen--and with Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance and Richard Boone--how could we go wrong? Well, here's how. The first hint came when ""A Golan and Globus Production"" appeared on the screen. Recalling that some of the worst movies we'd ever seen in the 60s and 70s came from them, we became a bit apprehensive, but held our breath, and kept watching.

What we saw, and heard, was the worst, most unbelievable, ridiculous acting we ever saw, with the plot not far behind. It's hard to imagine what these fine actors must have been thinking as they went through the motions, with their fellow ""actors"" expressing emotions as if in a silent movie. Boone's and Van Cleef's voices were clearly dubbed, and not by them, reciting their lines in a wooden, automaton-like style (think old Kung-Fu movies).

This might be the kind of movie it's fun to watch with a bunch of friends, just to make fun of it, but even that temptation is overwhelmed by the sadness one felt, watching the great Richard Boone (Paladin, ""Medic""), bloated, old, and reduced to performing such drivel.",1220832000,2,1152,4.72636815920398
1043452,5,630550508X,"TITLE: This picture was released in theaters in March of 1978 starring a very young but gorgeous Sybil Danning as Jenny, Lee Van Cleef as Father John and Lewis and Jack Palace as Sam Clayton.

SUMMARY: Picture starts in a little called Crane City where a Mexican is putting on a puppet show. As he starts to collect money, you hear gunshots coming from behind his wagon. Sam Clayton and his gang has just rode into Crane City where they terrorist the woman rob the bank and kill the sheriff and the deputy. A few days later Sam Clayton and his thugs ride into Juno City. Enters Sybil Danning who's playing the role of Jenny and she runs the only saloon in town. Also living with her is her son Johnny. Enters Lee Van Cleef who's the Priest or otherwise called Father John. Father John and Johnny are walking down the street when Jenny asks Johnny if he finished shining the glasses. Father John tells Jenny that Johnny will be back to finish shinning the glasses after he's done cleaning the church. While cleaning the church Johnny comes across a gun that belongs to Fathers John Brother Lewis. Sam is in Jenny saloon when Johnny walks in. Sam wonders while Johnny isn't in school. Sam also wants to know where Johnny's father is. Meanwhile at table a couple of Sam's thugs are playing poker when one of them is accused of cheating. Sam's nephew throws a knife in the back of the poker player that was cheating. As a man lying died in jenny saloon Sam Clayton and his gang start to ride out of town. Jenny is screaming at the people of the town for someone to go after Sam Clayton's nephew to bring him back to for justice. When the sheriff decides that he's not going Father John takes the sheriffs horse and rides out after Sam Clayton gang. That's leaves two unanswered questions.

QUESTIONS: What does the title God's Gun stand for? What does Father John comeback to town with Sam Clayton's nephew? MY THOUGHTS: I thought this was an excellent picture. Lee Van Cleef does an excellent job playing the role of Father John and the role of Lewis. Jack Palace was excellent in his role as Sam Clayton. The reason I bought this movie was Sybil Danning. You didn't see much of Sybil Danning body in this because it was a western but, she was excellent in her role as Jenny the owner of the saloon. Her talents as an actress really shined in this picture. So, with that in mind, and because this movie kept my interest through the entire picture I'm giving this movie 5 weasels stars because of Sybil Danning and the level of action , adventure and drama this movie had from beginning to end. If you want to see this movie, you can buy it in DVD format at Amazon.com",1219104000,,2664,4.4346938775510205

Only in this one, the one shelling out revenge has a gimick that gives the movie its title; but I give away too much.  Not a great film for acting but a couple of classic western actors almost pull this one above average on occasion.  Spaghetti westerns need to be judged in their context, I think.  This one is not one of the worst though it is certainly not one of the best either.  The story is interesting with redeeming qualities - there I go again giving away too much.",1167177600,3,584,4.263636363636364
1043455,2,630550508X,"What potential - A great title ""Gods Gun"" - three of the best tough guys ever, all with very respectable careers - Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance and Richard Boone. What is right? Jack Palance comes off OK. At times there are some clever script elements. That's it!

What's Wrong? What ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" was to Bella Lagosi, ""Gods Gun"" might be to these three actors. ""Gods Gun"" rivals Terror In Tiny Town in ineptitude. The actors in this Israeli - no budget Western must have been very hungry. You watch this film and wonder - how did this happen to them?

Van Cleef (who must have had the worlds worst agent), had all but lost his menacing charm. At this time in his career you wonder if directors were purposely mocking him -having him wear embarrassing costumes, wigs and at times singing awful theme songs. He must have realized he wasn't getting paid for this abomination because he obviously didn't stick around to loop in his own voice. He is ludicrously dubbed to sound like ""A Sons of Hercules"" character.

Cheep sets, lame clich&eacute;d music, horrendously bad costumes, awful peripheral actors, stereotypes, and a bland and confused teen idle - Leif Garret.

The whole thing would be unintentionally funny if it were not for the sadness of seeing three quality actors trying desperately to make this thing work. At least you don't feel so bad about Palance who went on to some better things - some quality Hollywood films and push-ups during an Academy Award ceremony.

It is very disturbing watching Van Cleef, and Boone knowing that for the remainder of their lives they were hopelessly stuck in poverty row films like this one.

""Gods Gun"" has a very high cringe factor for those of us who were once entertained by these guys. Others who don't care may be able to laugh at the film.

7890950,2,630550508X,"Released in 1976-77,  Gods Gun is a Matzo Ball Western about a preacher (Lee Van Cleef) who chases down a band of outlaws (led by Jack Palance) to apprehend a murderer. After the thugs get revenge the preachers spiritual son (Leif Garrett) teams-up with the one person who can set things aright. Sybil Danning co-stars as a saloon girl and Richard Boone has a minor role.

This Hebraic Western is stylized with a Spaghetti flavor, but is badly executed. I could never get a grip on the tone the filmmakers were shooting for. Is it semi-camp? Semi-parody? It's obviously not something to take too seriously, but sometimes the viewers evidently supposed to. Since you cant take the story seriously it prevents you from caring about the events of the story and thus its boring.

Thankfully, there are some highlights. For one, it was shot in Israel, which is unique for a Western. Secondly, there are a few stunning women, including Sybil Danning when she was around 23 and an uncredited saloon babe named Jessie. Thirdly, it's got Jack Palance and Lee Van Cleef; two Western icons. And, fourthly, Leif Garrett is surprisingly good at around 13 years-old.

But the confused tone and relative dullness do it in.

The film runs 94 minutes.
