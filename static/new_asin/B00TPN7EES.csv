7015392,1,B00TPN7EES,"I'd warn that my comment below is a spoiler, but trust me, there's nothing here to spoil! I watched this film all the way through because I was looking for a particular scene I had seen in an earthquake documentary once... What was I thinking? This movie isn't really about earthquakes! It's a sappy, poorly written script about a family trying to get out of LA before the ""big one"" strikes... This after racing to jump over a huge crack in a road,  hitting a baby hippo and almost getting ran over by it's mother hippo, and then getting robbed of their car by a crazy lady with a stolen gun! Why? Because they had to add something to the movie to make it exciting! Seriously, point after point in this movie is simply pointless. Lots of nonsense if you like nonsense, and some stuff happening that you'll never find out how it turned out; such as freeways jammed with cars going nowhere with a 12 point earthquake due any moment. Not to worry, though, because at the very last mili-second the guy who's supposed to save the day, who showed up to save his family... Rescues them a millisecond before the building falls away underneath them. They then fly away as happy as clams with peaceful, happy faces because they've been rescued! And why not? Wouldn't you be relaxing and smiling while flying over and away from the annihilation of one of the largest and most famous cities on earth...with possibly six million people along with it's destruction? Better things to be sad about I guess.",1518566400,3,1490,4.580524344569288

Initially, I thought this would be one of those low budget indie films that I would watch partway through and then forgo seeing the rest. What happened though? I ended up watching the entirety of this film without stopping or getting bored. Do you think that this is a good sign? I do.

7015494,3,B00TPN7EES,"San Andreas Quake, not to be confused with San Andreas starring Dwayne Johnson, is a typical disaster movie that, in all honesty, I probably wouldn't have watched if it didn't come free with Prime membership. I'm giving it 3 stars because it was 'free' and kind of funny (even spoof-like, all things considered).

Points in this film's favor:
1) It's relatively short (80 minutes), and almost a spoof of a disaster movie.
2) Some of the special effects are decent, despite the shoddy CGI of a certain zoo scene.
3) The movie didn't end where I thought it would at the beginning. I guess you could say that the resolution for the main characters came sooner than I expected given what was happening in the world around them. Their story ended while the rest of it was still happening.
4) The story centered on members of families trying to reconnect on the eve of a predicted disaster, rather than on the disaster itself. Even most of the throwaway victims and villains are presented as ordinary people trying to help their loved ones or save themselves, at any cost.
5) There were a couple of surprising twists, especially as the characters unexpectedly thrown together by circumstances came to learn more about each other. One of the surprises was cliche, but also rather nice in terms of offering character development and resolving a conflict between a stepmother and her estranged daughter.
6) I very much appreciated the 'wicked' stepmother fighting heaven and earth, so to speak, to get her husband's daughter to safety. For that alone, I'm tempted to give four stars but reduced it to three because...

Points against this film:
1) The acting, especially at the beginning. The actors actually do a better job with the high drama that comes later on, but in the beginning most of the admittedly terrible dialog is delivered very little enthusiasm. It's like everyone knows we haven't gotten to the good part yet, even the actors.
2) The ""forequakes"" are stated to be 4.0-5.5 on screen, yet with all of them causing landslides, collapses and absolute chaos that would be much more likely during 6.0-7.5 earthquakes. I've been in Los Angeles during a 5.5 quake. They don't cause that much damage.
3) A 100 year old brick and mortar hotel stays upright long after the more modern glass towers of the city are tilting and crashing to earth.
4) A small plane comes out of nowhere just in time to crash into the transportation some of the characters are using to get around, while said characters are arguing over where to go first. I laughed out loud, even though I'm fairly certain it wasn't meant to be funny. Or maybe it was. ;)
5) Having smelled H2S gas myself in chemistry class, I can't fathom how anyone would have been capable of walking into an enclosed area that is saturated with it. It settles to the ground, stinks like rotten eggs and causes a burning sensation in the eyes. And that's the only warning you get before it starts shutting down your respiratory system. Coma and death can occur within minutes of exposure to high concentrations. Since one of the characters identifies the poisonous gas as Hydrogen Sulfide by smell (and by knowing enough to confirm it with the coins in a victim's pockets), she ought to know better than to charge forward into the toxic fumes that have already killed a city worker right where he was standing.
6) For no rhyme or reason, one of the secondary characters suffers a bizarre fate at an unexpected time.
7) Someone wants to go to a certain somewhere - to the point of bribing someone else with $10,000 - and the reason for their urgency ends up being a disaster movie cliche all on its own. Maybe I should make this a point in the film's favor, it's so unexpected that I should have expected it.",1484697600,,3753,4.67624810892587

It's not that bad. The story is pretty good, but the leading actress isn't interesting enough. She is not funny, or emotional or anything. Just kind of blah. The only thing that could potentially save his movie would be the CGI effect. But they are obviously fake, (especially the rhinos) and we never get to see the scene where everything collapses.

However, even the low budget films can have some redemption with quality writing. I just don't see much of that, either. This movie was no exception. Trite, incomprehensible at times, and outright ridiculous the rest of the time (and I'm not referring to disastrous earthquakes). How characters get things done, make choices that somehow work out, and the number of coincidences in this film make it laughable.

7015605,2,B00TPN7EES,"Okay, this one isn't a classic.  Admittedly.  I only give it two stars.
But, we can still appreciate it for what it is--a simple disaster movie based mainly on a female perspective of feelings about how the earthquake impacts her family.  Oh, and the female lead is also the brave, crusading scientist that tries to warn the unlistening, uncaring world that ""the big one"" is coming, thanks to her just-achieved brilliant scientific break-through.

Yes, some scenes are kind of hokie...and some of the situations she encounters in locating and saving her family are also pretty hokie.  The disaster movie equivalent of the blond girl in a horror movie that, for inexplicable reasons, absolutely must enter that dark room/stairway/house/forest/whatever from which she just heard death-cries screaming loud and piercing enough to curdle her blood.

All of that understood, it's a nice background movie.  The fundamental story isn't bad, just overplayed.  I enjoyed having it on as a side story, since my wife has tinnitus and needs something playing in the background to distract.  This worked for that purpose.",1477612800,3,1108,5.214689265536723

So after the scientist convinces someone she is right about the coming catastrophe and the entire city has to be evacuated - which would mean all the roads are parking lots - but the scientist and her step daughter's boyfriend seem to find an array of roads that have no one on them.

The science is wrong, the damage shown from a 4.3 (and the LA reaction) is WAY over the top, the extensive exposition scenes had me fast forwarding because they were lame, the hero was able to easily run away from a giant CG hippo (don't ask), the two heroes were able to run on foot from Griffith Park to downtown in about 20 minutes, then took a tunnel *during quakes* to get to their destination which included time spent discussing the toxic gas that had killed someone they found down there before they started coughing and gagging. They repeatedly called out traffic on just one of the 30 bazillion freeways like that was the only way out of the LA basin.  By the end, I was rooting for stuff to fall on some of the more annoying characters, and it ended with the hero slo-mo run to a rescue helicopter while tall buildings collapsed in the background.

7015844,2,B00TPN7EES,"Let's be honest.  Nobody watches these earthquake-causes-California-to-sink-into-sea for the writing, the plot line, or the acting.  We all watch these movies to see the world's dumbest characters fumble their way across the screen to a certain and well-deserved doom, with spectacular special effects as the all-important backdrop.  While this film does have dumb characters coming out of its ears, the CGI is threadbare and cheesy, consisting mainly of panoramic shots of Los Angeles with random wisps of smoke and fire emanating from its skyscrapers, or shots of some miscellaneous building on fire.  They seem to have spent most of their CGI budget attempting to make a CGI hippo look like a rampaging gummy bear as it pounds into the main characters' van.  The final shot of random skyscrapers in LA coming down looked a bit fake, as if this movie had been made in the 1980s instead of the 2010s.

Unfortunately, this means that most of this movie focuses on the main characters, who are mostly uninteresting or annoying.  There is the plot-device father, the teenage daughter with an irritatingly squeaky voice, her cool black boyfriend, and the ever-angsty, overly-earnest, control-freak step-mama who also happens to be a seismologist with the USGS.  The cool black boyfriend was interesting at times, but aside from him, they could have crushed all of these characters under a ton of bricks, and I wouldn't have cared one damn bit.

The bottom line?  If you're going to do an earthquake film, do it right:  more dumb characters, more special effects, less dialogue, less attempts to be serious.  Leave the real drama to the Schindler's Lists of the world.",1464998400,,1664,5.054945054945055

I truly love them both and thank them for their services........but, I find that Prime original programs tend to end after one episode, or if lucky one season.

7016393,4,B00TPN7EES,"A bit of a twist this time for The Asylum with the wife/stepmum taking on the role of heroine and lead role in San Andreas Quake. The story is a typical Asylum tale of a family caught up in a disaster situation and running from one location to another in order to get everyone back together. But it wasn't a bad story - fairly well paced and enough action to keep the interest levels up. And along the way the disaster events continue to escalate. The acting was OK, with Jhey Castles making a particularly likable lead actor. Special effects are Asylum standard or actually slightly better in some places. It's obviously not a big budget production but perfectly adequate for a Sunday afternoon in front of the television. There are plenty of places where lack of time or care can be seen, from marginal sets to incorrect spelling in the ticker that floats along the screen during news broadcasts. But this is something regular viewers of Asylum films will be used to. There are a few more special features on the disk than usual - these don't add a lot of value but are fun.

7016581,4,B00TPN7EES,"Once again, The Asylum shows why it is the king of low-budget knockoffs.  Sure, the story is old and formulaic, some of the CGI effects are pretty bad, and some of the acting doesnt measure up, but I still think this is a pretty darn good Asylum disaster movie.  I sort of feel sorry for those who cant just sit back and get some enjoyment out of a silly little film like this.  I, for one, love Asylum disaster movies, and this one has all of the standard Asylum elements: one or more parents  one of whom has detailed knowledge of the natural disaster taking place  fighting to reach and save a child, a scientist with information no one takes seriously, on the road conversations about how bad the traffic is when we the viewers never see another single car going in either direction, periodic news updates on the deepening crisis, and, of course, the wholly predictable ending.

Molly Dunn (Jhey Castles) is a seismologist who has developed a system capable of predicting earthquakes up to several hours before they hit.  Unfortunately, her inability to back up those claims several years earlier means that no one believes her  not even her step-daughter Ali (Grace Van Dien).  As a series of increasingly large quakes begins to strike the Los Angeles area, though, Molly alone knows and believes that the long-dreaded big one is going to decimate Los Angeles within just a few hours.  Even though she has a strained relationship with her step-daughter, she insists on trying to reach Ali in downtown L.A. and usher her to safety.  She doesnt go alone, but the identity of her companion and Mollys interaction with that person is a major part of the story I don't want to reveal.

I really like Grace Van Dien, and not just because she looks like a hot clone of Avril Lavigne in this movie.  Shes a promising young actress I hope to see more of in the future.  Mollys traveling companion also turns in a good performance.  As with pretty much all Asylum films, there are several goofs and mistakes  but I actually find these little things sort of endearing; they're like the Asylums calling card.  Still, the whole zoo-related scene is really pretty bad  terrible CGI and one shot against blatantly wrong scenery.  Now, I understand that most people do not share my appreciation of the Asylums body of work, and I readily admit that some Asylum movies do indeed merit one star only  but San Andreas Quake really isn't a bad film.

(Incidentally, the big budget movie ""San Andreas"" didn't exactly get great reviews by the professional reviewers). I think Rotten Tomatoes showed a 4.5/10. I'm not allowed to post someone else's review for copyright reasons, but I urge the reader, if thinking of buying or downloading this movie to read the review from YIFY subtitles dot com I think it's permissible to quote a couple of lines though: ""...The elderly couple in the hotel were adorable and their story touching....."" and ""...The acting by everyone involved was excellent... I give it 8 stars because I want to balance out all the bad reviews this one will get because its Asylum and called Andreas Quake...."" But to continue, I feel that had I not been in the movie (as Mr. Lowenstein), and was seeing it cold, I'd be surprised that it was not being shown on the big screen.

I feel a lot of people who would have gotten to enjoy this movie won't being on only on DVD although the production company does have DVD distribution world wide.

This movie is just another doomsday scenario and somewhat of a clich. Certainly this movie is sensational and exploits Californian's fear of a massive killer earthquake. The movie 'Earthquake' is more exciting. This movie really exploits the San Andreas fault, which is of little threat. The fissure left gave the crust relief from the pressure below. California has more than 12,000 earthquakes per/annum, these relieve pressure coming from the mantle of magma, so I don't think the San Andreas fault line to be dangerous. When it struck is when it was dangerous. The real earthquake problem in southern California is the unpredictability of where the next large one will strike. When I lived in San Diego, for 4 years there were about 12 small earthquakes which drove us residents outside. This movie is really lousy, but worth the rental price.

The teenage actress had on so much eye makeup that it was ridiculous. It looked it was spray painted on. The gay guy looked like he was in a vampire movie with all his sharp white teeth. How was that mother able to wrestle her gun back from a guy twice her size? They were all scarier than the fake earthquake footage. At least the fake hippos could act. I give it 1 star for the hippos.",1432684800,,515,4.16
7016647,3,B00TPN7EES,"Stars : Jhey Castles & Grace Van Dien.

Write & Directed By: John Baumgartner

So, Its not SAN ANDREAS and Jhey Castles IS NOT The Rock, But Her and Grace Van Dien are both prettier than him.

Hey, Jason Woods is really good as the male lead,I suspected he was Micho Rutare Jr.,But been wrong before.

THERE is a helicopter,Like the one Overused in The Rock trailer.

Jhey Castles was so good in HANSEL Vs GRETEL as a baddie,To see her own a whole movie as its heroine is quite a leap in acting ability.

Grace Van Dien, Will for awhile longer be associated as Casper Van Diens daughter .

Its a good flick,Exciting,suspenseful and wild to see such evil happen to California,Besides that whole water thingy.",1432598400,4,707,4.519685039370079
7016648,1,B00TPN7EES,"This movie is so hokey.  I wish I had not purchased it.  I thought per some of the reviews it would be great, as I was born in Santa Cruz, CA.  Also, lived there when the 7.1 hit in 1989. I am going to give this away.  I usually add to my collection, but, this is not one I will keep.",1432598400,2,284,3.6065573770491803

7016651,3,B00TPN7EES,Usual graphics for an Asylum movie and the acting as will.  I agree that is not a major movie but then none of them are.  It started to get a little sappy near the end but a good disaster movie.,1432425600,11,194,3.825
8702586,5,B00TPN7EES,"No one watches movies from this company for the beauty of cinematography; the Lead was likable, the mostly ripped off story was fun.  The terrible CGI was awesome.  The hilarity of 4.0 and 5.0 earthquakes making bridges crumble and leading to fires was great.  Totally worth watching as long as you're not asininely expecting something highbrow or scientific.",1534723200,,359,5.155172413793103

8702590,5,B00TPN7EES,Omg this movie had me in tears laughing!!! The acting is pretty good but what made it was the corny scenes. Like the baby hippo! I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. We kept watching it because it was enough to keep us interested but we lost it with the hippo. I can't wait to see how this ends! If u need a good laugh than watch this movie! Love it,1524528000,,354,4.0

8702592,1,B00TPN7EES,"Look, this movie is absolute garbage, but it's entertaining garbage.  The effects and acting are universally awful, but some of the greatest fun comes from trying to spot mistakes in the background.  Most glaring, however, is the abysmal science used in the film:
1.  12+ magnitude quake?  Really?!
2.  A device capable of predicting quakes down to the second is impossible.
3.  LOS ANGELES BREAKING OFF INTO THE OCEAN.
Anyway 10/10 would giggle at horrifying destruction again",1520467200,,477,5.12987012987013
