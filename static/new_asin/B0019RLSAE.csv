8275093,5,B0019RLSAE,"MEN OF HONOR you say? I was really impressed by this film. This story takes place at a transitional time in history when men, real men, were measured by their mettle not their color. At least that was the way it was supposed to be. I really like this film. It's not flashy and has a good old-fashioned look and feel about it. Cuba Gooding Jr. enters the Navy with all good intentions but the lingering effects of a segregated military, even though recently abolished, weigh heavy on him. Military traditions good or bad are hard to break. Robert De Niro plays a Southern bigoted washed up Master Chief in charge of training at the U.S. Navy's diving school. Ordered by commanding officer Hal Holbrook to fail Gooding, De Niro begins to learn the real meaning of honor as shown by Gooding's determination and perseverance at insurmountable odds. Perhaps Gooding's conduct possibly rekindled in De Niro the recognition of those qualities that defined and are the very essence of honor in De Niro's burdened psyche. This film has much more to say than what seems apparent, but the images will linger with you. BROKEN ARROW gives us a certain honor to be sure, but quite different from the other film.",1379030400,,1197,4.704761904761905
