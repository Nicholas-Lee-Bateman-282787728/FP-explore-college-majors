8016940,5,B0001WJN4G,"I bought both Volume I and volume II of Kenny Kosek's Learning Bluegrass Fiddle videos, which I believe are the same as the DVD's.  I am planning to order the DVD's so that I can rewind more easily.  I found Kenny Kosek to have a very good teaching method, is relaxed, and he keeps you interested.  Practicing and being patient are important.  That is why it is so nice to rewind what you just see and play it again.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn to play fiddle.  He's an incredible musician.",1157155200,5,513,4.347368421052631
