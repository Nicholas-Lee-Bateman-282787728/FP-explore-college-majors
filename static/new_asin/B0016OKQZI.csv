3161923,5,B0016OKQZI,"season 2 of the popular Dogfights series as seen on the History Channel (and Military History Channel)... awesome series for anyone interested in aerial combat from WWI, WWI, Korean & Vietnam conflicts, and a few air battles from more recent times in the middle east. the series combines excellent CGI graphics with interviews of experts/historians and the real pilots who were there to explain the situations and the tactics they used.
it's a great thing to have these interviews on record as the members of this generation (WWII) won't be with us for a whole lot longer...
I noticed that in season 2 they improved the graphics of the ground/terrain over that which was seen in season 1... not a huge deal but does make the whole thing look a bit more realistic.
too bad it seems the series has been canceled but the great CGI technology seems to be living on in another series call ""Battle 360"" - also worth checking out for WWII history buffs.
only complaint is that just like in the season 1 DVD set, they didn't edit out the post commercial break re-cap segments - this gets very annoying when watching several episodes in one sitting... other then that, highly highly recommended for the air combat buff.",1226966400,3,1210,4.712264150943396

Filled with many great interviews with actual participants in much of the action being documented, coupled with the ""in the cockpit"" feel of the show, there is no other documentary on the subject of dogfighting quite like it. Why the History Channel would cancel the best, most exciting and informative show they've ever produced at the peak of its popularity is still a mystery. Don't miss out on a chance to own this show on DVD while it is in print.

3161931,3,B0016OKQZI,"I had seen various episodes of Season 2 in 2007 and was overwhelmingly impressed, I could hardly wait to see next week's episode.

The veterans/survivors of memorable 'dogfights' tell us about their encounters which are illustrated by state-of-the-art computer generated recreations which put the viewer into the pilot's seat. The program most efficiently and vividly conveys that handling a jet fighter - after all the fastest battle vehicle on this planet - requires an immense amount of skill, knowledge and natural talent or simply ""the right stuff"".

You'll see men driving themselves and their machines to extreme, blood-chilling limits and often wonder how they overcame insurmountable odds.

We look back onto an era, where fighting your opponent didn't just require to push a launch button but where fighting had the character of a duel with a certain amount of chivalry. You simply can't help to feel respect and sympathy for the unknown Egyptian pilot who managed to regain control of his crashing plane just a few feet above ground but was shot down anyway or the one who accidentally ejected into a canyon wall. The program acknowledges the skills of friends and foes and is rich in anecdotes and what it takes to be a pilot ace.

Produced in anamorphic widescreen and high definition, the previous first season was only available in widescreen letterbox (4:3)- the widescreen format from the 'stone age' of DVDs -, which is nowadays rather unusual and A&E had proven with the latest Horato Hornblower mini-TV-series that they seemed to 'understand' 16:9 widescreen.

As for me, I will only purchase Season 2 in up-to-date 16:9 widescreen on standard DVD or will wait for the future release on Blu-Ray disc.

Therefore, I will gladly give the program itself 5 stars but if - again -the program's presentation format will be equal to that of Season 1 the technical presentation will hardly merit 2 stars.",1208390400,5,1916,5.028391167192429

3161933,5,B0016OKQZI,Comments as for 'DOGFIGHTS SEASON 1'. The 'Dogfights' Seasons 1 & 2 are both recommended; both are very informative and entertaining.,1398643200,,133,5.380952380952381
3161934,5,B0016OKQZI,I received this in a timely fashion and the product is just as described.  I watched this series on streaming TV but then it was taken off of the list so I bought for myself.,1396828800,,174,3.9714285714285715
3161935,4,B0016OKQZI,I enjoyed the videos and the history that goes with it.  It would be improved if many of the views were not repeated.  It is obvious where the commercials were located and taken out.  I would guess 10-15% was repeated.,1396224000,,218,4.4
3161936,5,B0016OKQZI,"My husband has wanted these dvd's for a long time as we had them on TiVo but since we upgraded we were going to loose the series so I got these for him.  The delivery was right on time and the quality surpasses what he thought it would be.
Thanks amazon",1394409600,,253,3.9607843137254903
3161937,5,B0016OKQZI,"Great action and CGI, I have the first season, this one is if anything better.  The WW1 dogfight with Werner Voss is amazing.",1381881600,,125,4.434782608695652
3161938,5,B0016OKQZI,"I love this show!.  This is the best thing out there.  If you like aviation or military history, this is the show for you.  The really cool part, over and above the awesome dogfight action, is the comments from the actual men who where there.  This would make a great gift.",1355961600,,273,4.294117647058823
3161939,5,B0016OKQZI,"Animation impeccable, stories unexpected and detailed, interviews surprising and well captured. This ranks well with the two 360 series for realism and feels more personal than most documentaries. A good piece for historical reference. Definite keeper.",1355097600,,252,6.027777777777778
3161940,5,B0016OKQZI,"The computer animation is beautiful and shows details of the fights. It makes the stories very exciting and suspenseful. It also puts viewers in the pilots' seats.

This set contains 5 discs. Disc 1 contains the following episodes:
- Kamikaze. Before this, I did not know the Japanese had suicide rocket plane.

- Jet vs Jet: On  May 20, 1951, in the sky over North Korea, for the first time of air combat history, American jets fought against Communist jets.

- Thunderbolt: American workhorse planes in WWII.

- Gunkills of Vietnam: Skyraiders vs Mig 17 and F4 Phantoms vs Mig 21,  in Vietnam.

In short, this is One of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of air combat or history DVDs. If you love air combat or history, you don't want to miss this one. It's much more interesting than just reading history books.",1341792000,,820,4.537414965986395
3161941,5,B0016OKQZI,"This is the best show ever on dogfighting. most of us agree with that. The cgi effects are  stunning and the stories are all true. The only complaint could be that they don't feature enough ""enemy' aces! But there's some of them and I can't imagine why this show is no longer being made. But there you have it. And if any show needed to be on blu ray it was this one. The dvd's look great though and that's why this series is worth collecting. The stories of pilots battling to survive and to overcome the odds even are well done and poignant even.  Military history fans should jump on this one.",1320624000,,596,4.265486725663717
3161942,5,B0016OKQZI,This season is great. I am not a war buff but my husband is and he loves this set. I was very happy to find this for him and it definately was worth it.,1282608000,,152,3.5
3161943,5,B0016OKQZI,"This five dvd set has some really beautiful highlights.  The CGI is fabulous.  The resulting episodes are visually arresting - much more lifelike than actual combat footage, which tends to be grainy or washed out.  The CGI is so accurate that even the reflections on the fuselage of each aircraft follow the sun as the pilots maintain an orbit above or around a target, or pursue their enemy.  The sequences of aerial combat are very fluid and very close to the sort of dogfight scenarios that one might visualize without having had the actual experience of air combat.

""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" depicts the unique mission of the SonderKommando Elbe, and elite group of German pilots mustered together in a last ditch effort to stop the allies from entering Deutchland: Using stripped down ME109's, the mission of each pilot was to seek out and ram Allied B-17 and B-24's in Kamikaze fashion.  The CGI is great, but the interviews with two of the surviving pilots is especially interesting.

Also noteworthy is ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which goes into specific detail about the heroic exploits of the Brave African-Americans who flew P-51 Mustangs in covering missions for the B-24's and B-17's that flew combat missions in the skies over Romania and southern Europe.

Other Highlights:  ""Death of the Luftwaffe"" chronicles Operation Bodenplatte, which took place on New Year's day, 1945 against a forawrd American airbase in Europe; And ""Secret Weapons""  which are accurate depictions of the ME-262, the Kamikaze, and remotely controlled airplanes.

The air war in Korea is included in the episodes, ""Supersonic"" and ""Jet vs. Jet"".  Again, great CGI.  Ace Pilots Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Robbie Risner and Ralph Parr give great commentary.  The leap in jet technology and the effect it had on aerial combat and the resulting high speed problems each pilot faced are explained in surprising detail.

Of particular interest is the inclusion of about a half-dozen episodes that depict the F4 Phantom and the various missions assigned to their Pilots and Radar Intercept Officers.
I'm a huge fan of the F4 Phantom and the pilots that flew them, so these episodes are truly amazing to me. It's difficult for me to imagine to be at the top front of all that raw power.

Some noteworthy F4 Phantom sequences: ""The Bloodiest Day"" which depicts the May 10, 1972 bombing mission of the Hai Dong Railyards, and ""Gun Kills of Vietnam,"" which shows how effective the addition of a gun pod on the F4 was.

""Dogfights of Desert Storm"" is also covered extensively in one episode, and on another disc, an episode covering the exploits of the Israeli Air Defense Force is also included.

""The First Dogfighters"" feautres a segment devoted to the techniques of aerial combat that Eddie Rickenbacker and other notables such as Manfred Von Richtoffen helped to develop and are still studied by combat pilots today.

To its credit, the History Channel also put together a CGI series that dealt more with ground combat in World War II, but the CGI didn't work all that well.  Even though the historical information was accurately depicted, the CGI wasn't nearly what it should have been mostly by virtue of the complicated nature of recreating computer-generated human beings.  In other words, the soldiers didn't look real.

This is a great set.",1236988800,,3333,5.0
3161944,5,B0016OKQZI,"I bought this for my husband's Christmas gift, and he loves it!  It has been gratifying to see him enjoy hours of entertainment on a subject that fascinates him.  He is a pilot and loves to watch an episode and then come and talk over what he has learned and how he identifies with the people in the program.

It was a good choice for a Christmas gift, and I especially liked that I did not have to go to the mall to find it.",1232409600,,425,3.976470588235294
3161945,5,B0016OKQZI,Wonderful video for anyone with an interest in the history of planes.  Great reinactments and wonderful graphics!  Compliments season one series.,1231804800,,145,5.857142857142857
3161946,5,B0016OKQZI,I am very happy with my choice of this product. It arrived on time foe Christmas and I spent 50% less than I did last year for Dogfights Season 1 when I went through History.com directly. So thank you again. My fiance' is enjoying the DVDs very much. -Angelita McNutt,1231372800,,267,4.36
3161947,5,B0016OKQZI,"'Dogfights, season 2' is even better than the first season. Season 2 has 5 CD's instead of 4 that season 1 had, plus one extra battle per CD. This season has WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm and the Israeli Sx Day War.
I love both seasons. I watch them over and over again. If you want to watch air battles about famous aces like Robert S. Johnson, Robin Olds, Lee A. Archer and more. With air battles about the P-51, P-47, F-4, F-86, F-15, Mirage and more.
If you want to read about aces and air battles, then buy Osprey's 'Aircraft of the aces' books. If you want some action yourself, then buy 'IL-2 Sturmovik' and/or 'IL-2 F.B., A.E.P.', and if you want to watch air battles, then this is the documentry!
I'll always buy History Channel's 'Dogfights' series.",1231200000,8,769,4.5
3161948,5,B0016OKQZI,"The 1st season was excellent and so was the 2nd season. You don't need to be a military buff to enjoy this DVD. It shows more of the intensity of human conflict fought in the skies with bravado and sacrifice.

A demonstration of how men killed and died for their respective causes.

A must have for any DVD collection.",1230508800,,318,4.372881355932203
3161949,5,B0016OKQZI,"From the moment that the pilot of Dogfights appeared on my TV screen in late 2006 I have been absolutely enthralled with this program. My Season 1 DVD's get far more playtime than any of my others by far (including my beloved MST3K collections) and I am content to watch them repeatedly. When Season 2 was released I salivated at the thought of having the whole, complete series in my hands. My wife got me Season 2 for Christmas and I can emphatically give it 5 stars like it's predecessor.

For those not in the know, Dogfights was a television series which aired for 2 seasons on the History Channel which focused on the birth, growth, and continuing evolution of the modern day dogfight, or air combat between competing fighter planes (and in some cases bombers). The show uses state of the art CG animation, and this, coupled with interviews with the pilots who actually flew in the highlighted missions, really creates a unique visual experience for the viewer. I've heard strong rumors that the show has since been cancelled, which stuns and saddens me at the same time, given the intense popularity of the program.

There are more episodes for Season 2 than for Season 1 and they run the gamut from one episode detailing WW1 biplane dogfights to another episode regarding the major dogfights of Desert Storm. The CG is slightly better here than it was for Season 1 making an already stellar production that much better. Of the 17 episodes included I think far and away the best episode is the one on the P-51 Mustang, which is simply one of the best episodes ever introduced and is an adrenaline overloaded experience. This episode alone is worth half the price of purchase, as was the ""Death of the Japanese Navy"" episode from Season 1.

Special mention goes to ""Desert Aces"", another fantastic episode starring the elite Israeli Air Force (Ran Ronen is quickly becoming my favorite IAF pilot), ""Kamikaze"" which is a white-knuckled ride with the crew of the Destroyer USS Laffey, and ""Secret Weapons"", which introduced the deadly Me-163 ""Comet"", a rocket powered bomber killer which was notorious for it's incredible speed and deadly firepower. There's no bad episodes here, and all are well put-together and exciting and educational to watch. When Season 2 first aired I had heard that there was to be an additional episode chronicling the Falkland War and the air combat there, and I was *very much* wanting to see this episode, but it didn't pan out.

As others have mentioned there is no closed-captioning and one or two of the episodes are abruptly cut off prematurely as the credits are rolling. But other than that the image is crisp and will look fantastic on your flatscreen TV. Dogfights is certainly a show which will appeal to anyone who is a fan of anything air combat and is sure to please all. I just wish the History Channel had continued the series. I have the whole series and I still thirst for some more Dogfights action and have nowhere else to go. Highly recommended!",1230508800,,2998,4.737547892720307
3161950,5,B0016OKQZI,"Where do I begin? Right from where season 1 left off, series 2 comes back right at you adding even more aerial bottles using serious computer generated graphics.

The series does a great job of covering aerial battles across the 20th century starting from the very first aerial battles involving biplanes all the way to battles involving jets in Operation Desert Storm. The series does a great job of even including the legendary Tuskegee airmen and their contributions during World War II.

3396430,5,B0016OKQZI,Comments as for 'DOGFIGHTS SEASON 1'. The 'Dogfights' Seasons 1 & 2 are both recommended; both are very informative and entertaining.,1398643200,,133,5.380952380952381
3396431,5,B0016OKQZI,I received this in a timely fashion and the product is just as described.  I watched this series on streaming TV but then it was taken off of the list so I bought for myself.,1396828800,,174,3.9714285714285715
3396432,4,B0016OKQZI,I enjoyed the videos and the history that goes with it.  It would be improved if many of the views were not repeated.  It is obvious where the commercials were located and taken out.  I would guess 10-15% was repeated.,1396224000,,218,4.4
3396433,5,B0016OKQZI,"My husband has wanted these dvd's for a long time as we had them on TiVo but since we upgraded we were going to loose the series so I got these for him.  The delivery was right on time and the quality surpasses what he thought it would be.
Thanks amazon",1394409600,,253,3.9607843137254903
3396434,5,B0016OKQZI,"Great action and CGI, I have the first season, this one is if anything better.  The WW1 dogfight with Werner Voss is amazing.",1381881600,,125,4.434782608695652
3396435,5,B0016OKQZI,"I love this show!.  This is the best thing out there.  If you like aviation or military history, this is the show for you.  The really cool part, over and above the awesome dogfight action, is the comments from the actual men who where there.  This would make a great gift.",1355961600,,273,4.294117647058823
3396436,5,B0016OKQZI,"Animation impeccable, stories unexpected and detailed, interviews surprising and well captured. This ranks well with the two 360 series for realism and feels more personal than most documentaries. A good piece for historical reference. Definite keeper.",1355097600,,252,6.027777777777778
3396437,5,B0016OKQZI,"The computer animation is beautiful and shows details of the fights. It makes the stories very exciting and suspenseful. It also puts viewers in the pilots' seats.

This set contains 5 discs. Disc 1 contains the following episodes:
- Kamikaze. Before this, I did not know the Japanese had suicide rocket plane.

- Jet vs Jet: On  May 20, 1951, in the sky over North Korea, for the first time of air combat history, American jets fought against Communist jets.

- Thunderbolt: American workhorse planes in WWII.

- Gunkills of Vietnam: Skyraiders vs Mig 17 and F4 Phantoms vs Mig 21,  in Vietnam.

In short, this is One of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of air combat or history DVDs. If you love air combat or history, you don't want to miss this one. It's much more interesting than just reading history books.",1341792000,,820,4.537414965986395
3396438,5,B0016OKQZI,"This is the best show ever on dogfighting. most of us agree with that. The cgi effects are  stunning and the stories are all true. The only complaint could be that they don't feature enough ""enemy' aces! But there's some of them and I can't imagine why this show is no longer being made. But there you have it. And if any show needed to be on blu ray it was this one. The dvd's look great though and that's why this series is worth collecting. The stories of pilots battling to survive and to overcome the odds even are well done and poignant even.  Military history fans should jump on this one.",1320624000,,596,4.265486725663717
3396439,5,B0016OKQZI,This season is great. I am not a war buff but my husband is and he loves this set. I was very happy to find this for him and it definately was worth it.,1282608000,,152,3.5
3396440,5,B0016OKQZI,"This five dvd set has some really beautiful highlights.  The CGI is fabulous.  The resulting episodes are visually arresting - much more lifelike than actual combat footage, which tends to be grainy or washed out.  The CGI is so accurate that even the reflections on the fuselage of each aircraft follow the sun as the pilots maintain an orbit above or around a target, or pursue their enemy.  The sequences of aerial combat are very fluid and very close to the sort of dogfight scenarios that one might visualize without having had the actual experience of air combat.

""The Luftwaffe's Deadliest Mission"" depicts the unique mission of the SonderKommando Elbe, and elite group of German pilots mustered together in a last ditch effort to stop the allies from entering Deutchland: Using stripped down ME109's, the mission of each pilot was to seek out and ram Allied B-17 and B-24's in Kamikaze fashion.  The CGI is great, but the interviews with two of the surviving pilots is especially interesting.

Also noteworthy is ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" which goes into specific detail about the heroic exploits of the Brave African-Americans who flew P-51 Mustangs in covering missions for the B-24's and B-17's that flew combat missions in the skies over Romania and southern Europe.

Other Highlights:  ""Death of the Luftwaffe"" chronicles Operation Bodenplatte, which took place on New Year's day, 1945 against a forawrd American airbase in Europe; And ""Secret Weapons""  which are accurate depictions of the ME-262, the Kamikaze, and remotely controlled airplanes.

The air war in Korea is included in the episodes, ""Supersonic"" and ""Jet vs. Jet"".  Again, great CGI.  Ace Pilots Frederick ""Boots"" Blesse, Robbie Risner and Ralph Parr give great commentary.  The leap in jet technology and the effect it had on aerial combat and the resulting high speed problems each pilot faced are explained in surprising detail.

Of particular interest is the inclusion of about a half-dozen episodes that depict the F4 Phantom and the various missions assigned to their Pilots and Radar Intercept Officers.
I'm a huge fan of the F4 Phantom and the pilots that flew them, so these episodes are truly amazing to me. It's difficult for me to imagine to be at the top front of all that raw power.

Some noteworthy F4 Phantom sequences: ""The Bloodiest Day"" which depicts the May 10, 1972 bombing mission of the Hai Dong Railyards, and ""Gun Kills of Vietnam,"" which shows how effective the addition of a gun pod on the F4 was.

""Dogfights of Desert Storm"" is also covered extensively in one episode, and on another disc, an episode covering the exploits of the Israeli Air Defense Force is also included.

""The First Dogfighters"" feautres a segment devoted to the techniques of aerial combat that Eddie Rickenbacker and other notables such as Manfred Von Richtoffen helped to develop and are still studied by combat pilots today.

To its credit, the History Channel also put together a CGI series that dealt more with ground combat in World War II, but the CGI didn't work all that well.  Even though the historical information was accurately depicted, the CGI wasn't nearly what it should have been mostly by virtue of the complicated nature of recreating computer-generated human beings.  In other words, the soldiers didn't look real.

This is a great set.",1236988800,,3333,5.0
3396441,5,B0016OKQZI,"I bought this for my husband's Christmas gift, and he loves it!  It has been gratifying to see him enjoy hours of entertainment on a subject that fascinates him.  He is a pilot and loves to watch an episode and then come and talk over what he has learned and how he identifies with the people in the program.

It was a good choice for a Christmas gift, and I especially liked that I did not have to go to the mall to find it.",1232409600,,425,3.976470588235294

3396443,5,B0016OKQZI,I am very happy with my choice of this product. It arrived on time foe Christmas and I spent 50% less than I did last year for Dogfights Season 1 when I went through History.com directly. So thank you again. My fiance' is enjoying the DVDs very much. -Angelita McNutt,1231372800,,267,4.36
3396444,5,B0016OKQZI,"'Dogfights, season 2' is even better than the first season. Season 2 has 5 CD's instead of 4 that season 1 had, plus one extra battle per CD. This season has WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm and the Israeli Sx Day War.
I love both seasons. I watch them over and over again. If you want to watch air battles about famous aces like Robert S. Johnson, Robin Olds, Lee A. Archer and more. With air battles about the P-51, P-47, F-4, F-86, F-15, Mirage and more.
If you want to read about aces and air battles, then buy Osprey's 'Aircraft of the aces' books. If you want some action yourself, then buy 'IL-2 Sturmovik' and/or 'IL-2 F.B., A.E.P.', and if you want to watch air battles, then this is the documentry!
I'll always buy History Channel's 'Dogfights' series.",1231200000,8,769,4.5
3396445,5,B0016OKQZI,"The 1st season was excellent and so was the 2nd season. You don't need to be a military buff to enjoy this DVD. It shows more of the intensity of human conflict fought in the skies with bravado and sacrifice.

A demonstration of how men killed and died for their respective causes.

A must have for any DVD collection.",1230508800,,318,4.372881355932203
3396446,5,B0016OKQZI,"From the moment that the pilot of Dogfights appeared on my TV screen in late 2006 I have been absolutely enthralled with this program. My Season 1 DVD's get far more playtime than any of my others by far (including my beloved MST3K collections) and I am content to watch them repeatedly. When Season 2 was released I salivated at the thought of having the whole, complete series in my hands. My wife got me Season 2 for Christmas and I can emphatically give it 5 stars like it's predecessor.

For those not in the know, Dogfights was a television series which aired for 2 seasons on the History Channel which focused on the birth, growth, and continuing evolution of the modern day dogfight, or air combat between competing fighter planes (and in some cases bombers). The show uses state of the art CG animation, and this, coupled with interviews with the pilots who actually flew in the highlighted missions, really creates a unique visual experience for the viewer. I've heard strong rumors that the show has since been cancelled, which stuns and saddens me at the same time, given the intense popularity of the program.

There are more episodes for Season 2 than for Season 1 and they run the gamut from one episode detailing WW1 biplane dogfights to another episode regarding the major dogfights of Desert Storm. The CG is slightly better here than it was for Season 1 making an already stellar production that much better. Of the 17 episodes included I think far and away the best episode is the one on the P-51 Mustang, which is simply one of the best episodes ever introduced and is an adrenaline overloaded experience. This episode alone is worth half the price of purchase, as was the ""Death of the Japanese Navy"" episode from Season 1.

Special mention goes to ""Desert Aces"", another fantastic episode starring the elite Israeli Air Force (Ran Ronen is quickly becoming my favorite IAF pilot), ""Kamikaze"" which is a white-knuckled ride with the crew of the Destroyer USS Laffey, and ""Secret Weapons"", which introduced the deadly Me-163 ""Comet"", a rocket powered bomber killer which was notorious for it's incredible speed and deadly firepower. There's no bad episodes here, and all are well put-together and exciting and educational to watch. When Season 2 first aired I had heard that there was to be an additional episode chronicling the Falkland War and the air combat there, and I was *very much* wanting to see this episode, but it didn't pan out.

As others have mentioned there is no closed-captioning and one or two of the episodes are abruptly cut off prematurely as the credits are rolling. But other than that the image is crisp and will look fantastic on your flatscreen TV. Dogfights is certainly a show which will appeal to anyone who is a fan of anything air combat and is sure to please all. I just wish the History Channel had continued the series. I have the whole series and I still thirst for some more Dogfights action and have nowhere else to go. Highly recommended!",1230508800,,2998,4.737547892720307
3396447,5,B0016OKQZI,"Where do I begin? Right from where season 1 left off, series 2 comes back right at you adding even more aerial bottles using serious computer generated graphics.

The series does a great job of covering aerial battles across the 20th century starting from the very first aerial battles involving biplanes all the way to battles involving jets in Operation Desert Storm. The series does a great job of even including the legendary Tuskegee airmen and their contributions during World War II.

A series recommended for military buffs, this is definitely a worthy add on to any collection.",1229558400,,586,4.969387755102041

My dad, a former military aviator, is also hooked, so we may be back to purchase additional sets of both seasons.  I like the computer graphics, the simulations, and I especially like the interviews with the original pilots.  it's just fascinating, and I can truly appreciate what my father did.  I mean, I always knew he was a pilot, but after watching this, I understand so much more about the way he thinks and how he sees things.  All in all, a very good series.

8263616,4,B0016OKQZI,"An excellent series for military aviation lovers.
The CGI was very well done.
If you pay real close attention you will see some sloppiness in the quality control.
Wrong tail codes on the planes that the story are centered, one series of frames the proper a/c and code and then a different a/c  and tail code.
There are times the aircraft will appear with a full load of missiles after it supposedly fired all its ordinance and same with the fuel drop tanks.
But, regardless of this little issues the stories of the pilots and there missions are inspiring. What's great is having the actual individuals who are being depicted on camera telling the stories.
It's is a shame that the History Channel did not allow the series to continue. There loss.
Wish it would make a come back.",1408060800,,778,4.597122302158273
