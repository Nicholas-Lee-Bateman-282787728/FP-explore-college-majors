8537430,5,B0097ERH1A,"I had seen a part of this interview, but not all.  I then read the book ""No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden""; and wanted to see the entire interview after reading the book.  I have a greater appreciation for our military personnel knowing just a part of what they go through.",1369699200,,318,4.372881355932203
8537431,4,B0097ERH1A,"This is an extremely important interview and documentary. It was very well done. However, CBS did not give the presentation its just due. The original interview was presented in HD at 1.85 to 1. The interview is available on line with the same ratio. There are also several extra shorts on line that have not been added to the DVD. These were also 1.85 to 1. There is no reason to produce a DVD at the 1.33 to 1 ratio any longer. This is especially so, since the original anamorphic material is available. If cost is the reason this was done, CBS could have charged more for the disc.
Shame on CBS. Great and informative interview. The DVD was only adequate.",1366502400,,658,4.446280991735537
8537432,4,B0097ERH1A,I purchased this after watching the original interview. I agree with Mark Owen and believe this is an important part of history and it should be told be correctly. Who better to tell the story then someone who was actually there.,1360713600,,229,4.609756097560975
