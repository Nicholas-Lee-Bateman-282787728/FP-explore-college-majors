7977391,4,B00007JME8,"New Zealand film (but set in America) that starts off with a bizarre killing of a homicide detective in a hostage situation, which just make no sense when you see it, as what is the point of that if you're going to kill the officer who kicks down the door?  But anyway, this makes the deceased officer's partner decide he's over being a cop. He and his wife set off for a new life, a new house in a new state, but the guy's wife really wants to go camping, the guy can think of nothing worse, but agrees.  He mentions where they're going in a redneck bar where it's pretty clear their city kind isn't welcome or safe.  He sleeps with his wife under the stars, then drives off to get snacks at convenience store they drove past on the way in where the shop assistant is very odd.  When he gets back to his wife, she's been raped, beaten and is stumbling into the road.  He races her in search of a hospital, but has an accident with an oncoming truck.  His hysterical wife points to the driver, who was at the bar, and says he's her attacker, so the ex cop fires his gun into the ground next to his head and beats the guy unconscious, locking him in his truck's trailer.  He starts to realise this may have been a mistake, when his wife points to a nurse helping her and says the same she did when pointing at the truck driver.  After his wife's operation he decides to demand to see the sheriff to get justice for his wife.  The local police tell him the sheriff is busy, but he's not taking no for an answer.  He barges in on the sheriff is identifying the body of his son, who just happens to be that trucker he left for dead.

This is a movie where crime scenes aren't really kept contamination free, and evidence is just lying around in the police station to be tampered with or stolen.  Also where an actor can kick another actor in the head but clearly miss. Still it's pretty entertaining for a low budget movie.",1510617600,,1919,4.213114754098361

7977393,5,B00007JME8,"I never heard of Jonathon Schaech before, until I saw ""WELCOME TO WOOP WOOP."" ""Blood Crime"" was filmed a long time ago and it isn't widescreen either. I think it may have been a cable television show. But, it is enjoyable and a collectible, as Jonathon has been in more movies than I realized. And girls....and guys, Ahem, he is hot.",1351382400,2,333,4.475409836065574
7977394,4,B00007JME8,"BLOOD CRIME is a made for USA tv movie that is much better than one usually gets in this genre.  Johnathon Schaech delivers a good performance as a cop who tires of being a cop and heads off from his Seattle roots with his wife, played by Elizabeth Lackey.  She wants to go camping, so they find a nice little spot and as hubby goes off to a convenience store for snacks, his wife is brutally attacked, almost raped and has to fight her way free.  Later, she identifies a local redneck as her assailant, upon which Schaech viciously beats him, but puts him alive and breathing in the back of the truck he was driving, locks the doors and off he goes.  Later, when he meets up with the town sheriff (icily played by the always dependable James Caan), he finds out that the guy his wife accused has been found dead, beaten to death, and low and behold, it's Caan's renegade son.  At this point, Schaech does some evidence tampering, stealing, etc., to keep Caan from knowing about his involvement with his son.
Caan and Schaech play off each other nicely and Lackey is much better than she was as Dean Cain's wife in ""Boa.""  Director William Graham keeps the plot moving and there are some unexpected twists and turns.
A tight, well wrought tale of vengeance and family dysfunction.",1081555200,8,1280,4.495689655172414
