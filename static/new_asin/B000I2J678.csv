2652861,5,B000I2J678,"I'm in the US, and I started watching this show in 1986, when our public TV stations ran a lot of old episodes of ""Britcoms"" (though maybe this is an ""Ozcom""). Ruth Cracknell is a mother in the Olivia Soprano school of Evil Parents, always criticizing her dutiful (if not always happy about it) son Arthur for ""whinging"" (I word I learned from Britcoms) and treating her other son, the negligent but smoothly glib Robert (who takes credit for Arthur's good deeds whenever he can), with overweening affection that's meant to be a barb for Arthur.
While I don't think it was as great a series as ""All in the Family"", it was reliably very, very funny. My then future hubby and I watched it faithfully, even when we had to get out of bed to do it :)And though the entire cast is good, you really should watch Ruth Cracknell as the Mother. She's a pistol.
And as some other have said, $27 for 7 episodes is just price gauging. I think I'm gonna have to wait to buy it. But if you have the money (I don't), you should check it out.",1192320000,10,1025,4.288659793814433
2652862,5,B000I2J678,I agree with what others have said. This is the funniest show I think I have ever seen. I am thrilled to get the first season. It really is one of the best sitcoms ever.,1192233600,3,169,3.857142857142857
2652863,5,B000I2J678,This is the longest running show in Austrailia for its time. This is the best show ever. Buy it and hope they release the rest of all the other series.,1176940800,5,151,4.066666666666666
2652864,5,B000I2J678,"Enjoyed this dvd ,seen it years ago and the second time around was as good as the first time",1175558400,,92,3.8947368421052633
2652865,4,B000I2J678,"We were so glad to be able to find Mother and Son and enjoy it again

after so many years.  It brought back fun memories.  Hope we can find

more of this fun series.",1168387200,3,165,3.764705882352941
2652866,5,B000I2J678,"These discs are ""region 1"" and will play on your DVD player.  Mother & Son, a product of Australian television, is quite possibly one of the best sit-coms ever made.",1166227200,9,165,4.5
2652867,5,B000I2J678,"This show aired in America on PBS stations in some locales, and quite frankly, it is one of the absolute best shows in the history of television. In my book, it is tied with All In The Family for best show of all time. If you like some of the better classic BBC comedies..you'll love this Australian show!

  Not only is this show roaringly funny- (largely thanks to senile Maggie, and the various circumstances that always seem to make her live-in caretaker son Arthur look like the bad guy...while her other son, Robert, a well-to-do dentist who has little real concern for his mother maggie, always seems to come out looking like the responsible one) but it is also a quite dramatic show, and you can empathize with virtually all of the characters at various times.

  I was elated to see this show finally come to DVD....but i am also annoyed at the fact that they are only releasing the first season- which only consists of 7 episodes- whereas they could have just released the whole series at once- it's only comprised of 40 episodes.

  Even though this is a great show, I think the fact that one has to pay $27 for 7 episodes will probably make it a dismal seller, even among long-time fans of the show, and will probably result in future seasons not being released. I am very reluctant to buy a series that is released this way...but for this show, I am making an exception.

  I do wish the DVD producers would stop jerking us around like this though- and my dissatisfaction with their self-defeating marketing ploys has resulted in me buying far fewer DVDs than I otherwise would have, had the various companies released seasons of various shows in a more timely manner.",1165449600,30,1681,4.585284280936455
2652868,4,B000I2J678,"I used to love this series on PBS when I was a young teen.  Seeing Arthur increasingly frustrated at his mother's antics made me howl with laughter.  Particularly amusing is Arthur's sister-in-law, who is always coming down with a ""MEEEgrain"" [migraine] headache.  I'm glad this series is available on DVD at last so I can relive the fun.",1164067200,2,338,4.793103448275862
8143782,5,B000I2J678,"This she is so funny, I want to buy the rest of the season, when they became available in the US format.",1490486400,,104,3.772727272727273
8143783,5,B000I2J678,"There never has been and probably never will be a sitcom as funny as ""Mother And Son"".  I doubt PBS will ever air it again, pity an entire new generation is missing out on shows that will have you chuckling hours or days after you watch it.
I suspect a vulgarity a minute would have kept it on TV but it would lose it's true lovable-ness.",1413590400,,338,4.121212121212121
8143784,4,B000I2J678,"We have enjoyed watching this show again. We saw it in the 80s but were unable to find it. So glad we did, it reminded of pass memories we had. Thank you.",1403222400,,154,3.84375
8143785,2,B000I2J678,"This one just doesn't make it.  The premise is terrific, but this thing never really takes off or lives up to the expectation.",1310515200,,126,4.478260869565218
8143786,4,B000I2J678,My mother got me hooked on this years ago.  She still talks about how funny it was.  I surprised her with the Season 1 video for Christmas.  I guess it doesn't come with closed caption.  Neither one of us hear very well and so missed all the punch lines.  Is it because it is British and our American TV can't understand the dialog and show closed caption?  It will just have to go on the shelf.  Sigh.,1293840000,,402,4.142857142857143
8143787,5,B000I2J678,I was so excited to see that they finally had this item for sale. I used to watch the series years ago and could not ever find it to purchase it. I hope to be able to buy all of them.,1281225600,2,183,3.4878048780487805
8143788,5,B000I2J678,"Great characters and story lines.  If you are a fan of British comedies you will love this series from Australia. We especially loved the episode entitled ""The Funeral"". I can't wait to get the rest of the series.",1213833600,2,213,4.605263157894737
8143789,5,B000I2J678,"I fondly remember watching ""Mother and Son"" back in the 1980's and reveling at Maggie's latest antics and poor son Arthur's frustration especially when Maggie constantly interrupts his love life.
 Ruth Cracknell as Maggie was one of the most respected Australian actresses of the stage and this was a courageous and brilliant change for her and she STEALS the show!

  I do wish that the entire show will be released soon especially the one where Maggie stops the Funeral Cortege of her brother-in-law in order to buy some oranges along the road and ends up dropping them into the grave!! :)

HIGHLY recommended.",1200614400,5,612,4.902912621359223
8143790,5,B000I2J678,This is a funny show.  It's a shame PBS doesn't show this one.  Can't wait to buy season two.,1199664000,2,93,3.8421052631578947
8143791,5,B000I2J678,"My mom and dad always loved this show.  I was thrilled to find in on a DVD that plays on American machines.  It's Australian, but very much in keeping with the style of brit coms. I will definately buy other seasons.",1195084800,2,216,4.2439024390243905
