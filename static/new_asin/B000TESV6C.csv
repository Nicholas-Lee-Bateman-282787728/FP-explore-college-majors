8208685,3,B000TESV6C,rather like a 1950's b movie.  you paid your money...you might as well watch it.  one thing though...it was good seeing Michael ontkean again.  he's always good.,1526688000,,161,4.888888888888889
8208686,2,B000TESV6C,"A big corporation gone bad is not  a new idea. A green-sailed ship is different.  I've seen a couple of the actors before and they aren't that good. Without giving away the ending I can tell you there is a little surprise. Unusual looking ""natives"", wonder where they got all of that bleach for thier hair?  Don't see anything to recommend this movie.",1516665600,,351,4.5396825396825395

8208688,3,B000TESV6C,"This movie had a predictable story line. IE> Bad corporate line-tower sees the error of his ways and sets off the take on his bad ol' money grubbing boss. Which in the right hands is a great, exciting movie. What happened here looks like a combination of LACK of money, mediocre directing and poor editing. Good solid line-up of actors and actresses that seemed to have little to work with. The movie is very choppy, character development is nil and you could drive a truck through the loosie-goosie plot.  Some great exterior and location shots makes me think they went over budget and then started cutting alot of corners to bring this in. I like it as a lazy, sit around the house and watch B movies with a bowl of popcorn kinda thing.",1397952000,2,738,4.507462686567164
8208689,2,B000TESV6C,"I guess there is a reason for this being the first review on Amazon for this movie. It wasn't that good. Don't get me wrong, I get the plot. It is about a group of people fighting for a native tribe that are lied too in-order to force them off their land so a dam can be built. You know small man against big corporation and the small man wins but with sacrifices. The acting is not that impressive. I am glad I bought this in a movie pack so it was not that expensive.",1230249600,6,469,3.9473684210526314
