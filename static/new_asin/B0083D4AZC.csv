8524467,4,B0083D4AZC,"The Great Courses series, The Persian Empire is a fascinating look at a fascinating period in history. It is taught by Prof. John W.I. Lee of the University of California-Santa Barbara. Lectures 1 and 2 are introductory lectures which discuss the reliability of the sources (or lack thereof) we have on ancient Persia. Lecture 3 talks about the world before the rise of the Achaemanid dynasty---or, as they would have called themselves in Persian, the Akhumenashiyan. Lecture 4 discusses the reigns of Cyrus the Great---known in Persian as Kirush or Kurush---and his successor, Cambyses---Known in Persian as Kambujiyah. Lecture 5 talks about the life and work of King Darius I---known in Persian as Dariush or Darvayush---while lecture 6 is about daily life in the various capitals of ancient Persia and it also discusses daily life in the Persian royal palace. Starting around lectures 6-10 it gets particularly interesting, because Professor Lee asks the listener to imagine oneself traveling through the entire Persian Empire. Lecture 7 is about how the kings of ancient Persia have been depicted throughout history---whether by their supporters, by their enemies, or by historians with various perspectives and biases---and who they really may have been as rulers and as men. Lecture 8 is about royal roads and provinces and how the empire was governed more generally. Lecture 9 deals with the Eastern parts of the empire near the Indus River. Lectures 10 and 11 deal with several wars waged between the Persians as the Greeks. Lectures 12 and 13 focus on the reign of King Xerxes I---known as Kshayarsha in ancient Persian or as Shurush or Surush in modern Persian---and lecture 14 is about the various ways in which the peoples of the Persian Empire, as well as those outside of it, influenced one another. Lecture 15 is about the role of religion in the Persian Empire, while lecture 16 talks about how the Persian kings consolidated their power. Lecture 17 is about the war between the two brothers, and lecture 18 focuses on the economy of ancient Persia. Lecture 19 talks about urban and rural life in the Persian Empire, while lecture 20 is about the role of women in the empire. Lecture 21 discusses the life and career of Artaxerxes (445 BCE-358 BCE), ancient Persias longest ruling king, while lectures 22 and 23 focus on the defeat of the Achaemenids at the hands of Alexander the Great, and the last lecture summarizes the course
 Regarding religion in the Persian Empire, Prof. Lee did get some things wrong. He described the Zoroastrian religion as polytheistic, when in actual fact, it was both monotheistic and henotheistic, which is to say that it is also a religion which, while recognizing a single God---Ahura Mazda---it does not deny the existence of any other gods. In other words, while the Zoroastrian religion itself was originally founded as a monotheistic religion, and while most Zoroastrians today consider themselves to be monotheists, many Persian kings, in the name of pluralism and in the name of giving all of their subjects religious freedom, decided to reinterpret the religion and turn it into a henotheistic faith. I also found it odd that Prof. Lee forgot to mention the heavy influence which the Zoroastrian faith had on Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
 All in all, I would highly recommend this course. It is really fascinating.",1503619200,,3375,5.035778175313059

8524469,5,B0083D4AZC,"Since U.S.'s policy in the Middle East changed (under pressure from Saudi's , Israel, and Oil Companies), there has been a relentless and unfair misrepresentation of Persians (Iranians) in the west, Russian already despiced Iran for stopping communism from reaching to warm waters of the Persian Gulf, which is called Arabian Gulf by Arab lovers. The most surprising is recent enmity by Zionists under Natanyahoo, who once changed an old proverb in the UN, and said The Enemy on My Enemy, is my ENEMY. This the depth of stupidity on his part, who is threatening Israel's oldest ally and Jew Liberators since the time of Daniel. Iranian-American community in the US is a vibrant and educated community, composed of Muslins, Jews, Armenians, Assyrians and many more, who are gradually breaking this heavy wall of ignorance that has been started by Alexander, and helped by desert Arab invaders who destroyed everything Persian, but could not destroy this strong culture, and they are still P.

8524472,3,B0083D4AZC,"Interesting course, but strange. Can the word strange describe a history book, speech and course? Maybe not, but I can't find a better word, as Im still somehow in doubt how I could and should summarize my experience with this study.
Professor John Lee insists that Persia and Iran are two very different things, but the whole history starts in Pars and Susa and Ilam, places and people which have always been a part of Iran; The Persia. Professor refers to all the tablets and other historical texts found in Babylon as the arguments for his story, but denies (and not only questions) the value of Cyrus' cylinder describing the human rights. He simply judges it as propaganda. However when he describes how Persian kings ruled the empire and how Persian people lived, he constantly confirms its validity.

So interesting story, and definitely worth to read (or listen to as I did), but if it is a pure objective history book, without any political or personal motivation, I'm not sure.

I will continue with my study about Persian history, as this course left me many questions and doubts. And indeed made me much more curious.",1406505600,3,1129,4.7846153846153845
8524473,4,B0083D4AZC,"I would give this course 5 stars if it had presented more maps. I'm a map person & find it necessary in understanding where events took place. Professor Lee is very knowledgeable, speaks clearly & I found this history of Persia to be quite interesting. Since so much has been written on the Western Civilizations, it was remarkable to learn the history before the West.
Recommend.",1405814400,4,380,4.7727272727272725
