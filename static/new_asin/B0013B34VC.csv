8249708,5,B0013B34VC,"Hell Girl has done a remarkable job thus far. Besides a short stumble with the introduction of the character Gilles, this series has continued to tell an incredibly complex and compelling story. Pushed forward by a cast of believable characters and leaving the audience asking questions, the ending of this series is easily one of my most anticipated. Very highly recommended.",1221523200,3,376,5.180327868852459
