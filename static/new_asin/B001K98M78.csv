3663452,5,B001K98M78,"""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is a spectacular TV show, a good movie, and a wonderful series of graphic novels. If you wanted to try, it'd be a great novel, mini-series, micro-series, film trilogy, comic strip, radio show, live-action show, or anything else. ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" would succeed in any forum, because it is a spectacular story. And if you've got that, you have everything else in the bag.
The show follows the adventures of Edward and Alphonse Elric. They live, not in this world, but a close parallel called Amestris, where science has diverged from ours--though far more sophisticated in its way, the science of alchemy has superseded all our sciences in importance. It's easy to see why: if you understand the composition of matter, alchemy can produce anything out of anything--as long as you abide by the law of equivalent exchange: to obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
The one exception to this rule is life.
But when their mother dies, the distraught brothers ignore this rule and do everything they can to bring her back, with disastrous consequences. The resurrected monster is nothing like their mother; Alphonse loses his human body; and Edward is literally ripped apart, left with an arm and a leg.
Torn by guilt over his brother's condition, Edward sets off--with his brother, in a strong but inhuman form--to correct the travesty he has committed. He is determined to bring his brother's body back, but the only way to possibly do that is to find the legendary Philosopher's Stone--the only object on earth that can surpass and ignore the law of equivalent exchange.
In order to obtain the Stone, however, the Elric brothers have one option: they must become State Alchemists, working for the military, doing everything they are bid, whether war or destruction or murder, as the military is the only organization with information on the Stone. It's equivalent exchange all over again.
Their quest for the Philosopher's Stone run a close parallel with Edward's career as a State alchemist, with hilarious, uplifting, awe-inspiring, and often tragic consequences.
""Fullmetal Alchemist"" contains a powerful story, thought-provoking,artfully-rendered themes, amazing storylines, and the richest characters I have ever encountered in film or television. Character depth actually rivals many good novels.
I have no complaints about this product. It is highly recommended. If, for any reason, the fact that it is an anime throws you off--unlikely, but possible--don't let it. An amazing story is an amazing story, whatever its form. If you love a brilliant story, ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" is a must.",1258070400,11,2624,5.220379146919432
3663453,4,B001K98M78,"FullMetal Alchemist is one of my favorite anime series of all time, and can't come more highly recommended. The show is engaging from the start: the plot centers around the Edward and Alfonse Elrich -- two brothers in an alternate world (similar to pre-World War I Germany) where alchemy is possible. The boys end up paying an unexpected price when they perform a forbidden ""human alchemy"" experiment to resurrect their dead mother. The process costs Edward his an arm and his leg and his brother, Alfonse's body. He manages to attach his brother's soul to a suit of armor. The brothers begin a search for the Philosopher's Stone to return their bodies to normal.

The adventures the two brothers face had me sitting on the edge of my seats. The world they live in is convincingly real, and the artwork and music is spectacular. The anime puts you through every emotion possible --laughter, warmth, heartache and tears ... with an unexpected ending that will leave many tearful. If the rumors are true, and a sequel television series is planned for this series (crosses fingers) I'll be first in line to buy it.

This is only the first season (25 episodes). You'll need to purchase both the first and second season box sets to have the entire series. To find out what happens after the series, you'll need to watch the FMA Shamballa movie.

ETA 2010: I docked FMA one star, only because FMA Brotherhood seems to adhere closer to the manga. Plot twists/holes that didn't make sense in the first FMA, were addressed fully in Brotherhood. FMA One has more heart and humor; FMA Brotherhood seems more complete and structurally-sound in plot.",1248220800,5,1637,4.797872340425532
3663454,5,B001K98M78,"This is a fantastic series. Excellent writing, plot, and characterization, and the story delivers a perfect mix of funny, emotional, tragic and triumphant elements.",1244160000,2,164,5.875
3663455,5,B001K98M78,Ordered this for my son's birthday.  Arrived on time and in great condition.  My wife and I are now big fans of the full metal series.,1243900800,,134,4.115384615384615
3663456,5,B001K98M78,"The only other perfect anime series I've seen besides Cowboy Bebop.

First a brief summary of the plot.  The story takes place in a alternate earth in a country called Amestris.  Alchemy is uesd heavily in this world, unlike our own.  The story follows Edward and Alphonse Eleric brothers on their search for the Philosopher stone to restore their bodies they had lost when they tried to bring their mother back to life.  They join the STATE ALCHEMIST under Roy Mustang so they can search better for the stone.  Now onto the many reasons why this series is perfect.

First the story:  It's simply brilliant, I've seen nothing like it.  The story is captivating, it draws you in and never lets you go.  It mixes drama, action/adventure, religion, family, and fantasy perfectly.  It's emotionally charged as you follow Ed and Al on their tragic journey.  There are no flaws int the story, it even surprises you when one of the main characters dies, which will surprise you and even bring tears to your eyes.

Second are the Characters:  Simply Perfect.  There are many characters from Ed and Al to Roy, Winry, Riza Hawkeye, Maes Hughes, Scar, Lust, and many others.  Each bring something to the series and engage you into the series.  Of course my favorite character is the one who ended up getting killed, I won't say which one, but it drew me even more into the series.  As the story progresses onto the second half of the series you'll be introduced to even more great characters.

Third is the Animation:  The animation was excellent.  It was done by Bones which has done other great series like WOLF'S RAIN, RAHXEPHON, EUREKA SEVEN, and MARS DAYBREAK.

Fourth the music:  It was classic.  The music which was mostly classic style was breathtaking and added extra emotion to the show.

Overall Fullmetal Alchemist is perfect series which makes statements about war, religion and family.  It is a must to any anime fan.  Though skip the movie it adds nothing to the series and isn't good.  I don't even think of it as part of the series",1240704000,,2037,4.677966101694915
3663457,5,B001K98M78,"Hey,

I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good anime with good action, awesome voices, and incredible animation. However I believe I should warn you that it is not the entire First Season. If you want the whole season buy the smaller box sets. Enjoy!",1240099200,2,266,4.541666666666667
3663458,5,B001K98M78,"I fell in love with this show after watching it and I noticed the listing on Amazon and I knew they would have it at Best Buy so I went out and bought it there.  It was worth every penny. Spectacular acting and animation make it a thrill to watch.

Edward and Alphonse travel to different cities in search of the philosopher's stone to restore their lost bodies.  It's a very intriguing story and everything is top notch.  This show also has some of the best opening theme music around and the English dub is terrific and people usually complain about it.  But I love it, and since I like to watch it in English, the spectacular acting is just as good as the Japanese version.

i bought this at Best Buy and it was cheaper than Amazon but it is worth shelling out money for if you don't have the DVDs and it's cheaper than buying the split season sets.

The difference between this set and the Season One Parts 1 and 2 is that they put seven episodes on each disc instead of four episodes on each disc.  It's also slightly cheaper than buying each set separately.  It also has all the guidebooks from the original DVD volume releases.

Worth the money and your time, get it before it's gone!",1233619200,2,1191,4.324324324324325
3663459,5,B001K98M78,"Fullmetal Alchemist is one of those stories that while you're watching, you wonder how anyone could have come up with such a complex and original plot.  The anime is based on the manga ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" but the stories go two separate ways.  They share a few similar plot twists, but ultimately the outcome for the two characters is completely different.

This DVD is a great buy for people who enjoy learning about the behind-the-scenes stuff from the show.

The product includes four discs that carry 25 episodes (roughly 4 episodes per disc) and they each come in their own thin, plastic casing.  The four casings each have character artwork from the show.  The product also comes with a smaller box of six texts.  Each booklet has fun facts about characters, plus character drawings and concepts and other fun stuff.  The outer box that carries all of this is pretty thick, at roughly 1 1/2 inches, but it's worth the vastness for all of the goodies it holds!",1233619200,31,967,4.748502994011976
3663460,5,B001K98M78,"I'm sure between the different versions that have been released that everyone has probably convinced you why you should or shouldn't buy this. I don't consider myself an anime fan per se (I watch sporadically, ""Bleach"" is probably the only current series I watch regularly) so I am no expert, but I have seen a fair amount, and in my humble opinion this may very well be the best piece of anime ever made.  (Again, there are many differing opinions and series and movies.)  A close second, in my opinion, would be some of the work of Hayao Miyazaki (""Princess Monoke,"" ""Nausicaa,"" ""Spirited Away"") or Satoshi Kon (""Perfect Blue,"" ""Paranoia Agent,"" ""Paprika."")

The pacing, thought-provoking issues raised, character and plot development, action scenes, depth--everything is just about as perfect as one could expect from a series, animated or not.

I would like to add one final note: I saw this edition in a retail store, and it seems to include four individual discs (eps. 1-25, complete season 1--there are two seasons total) and a rather thick supplemental booklet that was labled something to the effect of ""episode guide,"" I assume it may be material similar to what the individual discs have (they are still for sale, but it's much cheaper to buy one of the boxed sets.)

FYI: this is not a bootleg, this is an officially released version.",1233100800,27,1346,4.860262008733624

3663508,5,B001K98M78,"One of the most appealing things about Fullmetal Alchemist is the inclusion of so many different tones. There are complete episodes devoted to humor, and others to drama or heartache. There are suspenseful and fun action sequences, and moments that could make almost anyone cry. It is the slow pace that makes it possible for this anime to include all of these different elements, but the series never becomes boring. Rather, it is captivating in the way it draws you in little-by-little, introducing and developing the characters slowly, and allowing each event to subtly change or reveal something about them.

The main villain of this series is not the first of its kind, and is even borderline clich. Even so, I have never hated a villain in any other story so much as I hate that of Fullmetal Alchemist, and this is both an asset and an impediment to the series. Its a fairly common belief that the villain of a story needs to be more likable than the heroes, and this principle is more or less followed in the case of those seven in this series who might be called secondary villains (though they are, in fact, more prominent than the main villain). However, the antagonist of this series is purely hateful in every way, lacking all charisma. What little we see of this person keeps them from becoming a real hindrance to enjoying the series, and surely the amount of bad feeling they inspire is an accomplishment in itself. Even so, I think that if Fullmetal Alchemist has one flaw, it is in this character.

In a series as versatile and deep as this, it is hard to pinpoint one particular overarching theme, though it may be in the closing lines of the anime. The series focuses on the humbling experience of confronting ones own humanity, and learning the bitter but somewhat comforting truth of imperfection both in oneself and in the world as a whole. However, there are many themes throughout the series, such as dissatisfaction, delusion, sacrifice, responsibility, guilt, and coming of age, and I think that is another reason why this series is so widely loved: almost anyone can connect with something in this series.

The soundtrack is not least among the reasons that Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the greatest anime of all time. It is placed perfectly in every way, is as versatile as the series itself, and greatly aides in telling the story and setting the mood. At times it is remorselessly, charmingly adventurous and joyful in sound - a reminder of its age. But it also possesses beautifully mournful pieces, most notably Brothers, which is sometimes sung by a childrens choir. And then there are those moments when the soundtrack has a fittingly classical sound, even including two gorgeous covers of Chopins Etude Opus 10 No. 3.

Similarly, the animation sometimes has that nostalgically old-fashioned style, but it is hardly lacking in quality, especially in light of when it was released. The artwork is superb, with gorgeous lighting and character designs that are perfectly altered from manga to anime style and format. Manga art is a different thing than that of anime, and requires less shading. In the case of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga, the faces are not detailed, with features drawn simply with clean lines. And, as in most manga, the appearances of the characters vary from panel to panel, making them look different ages at different times. In the interest of consistency, animators have to choose one look and go with it. With the task of transferring the characters of the manga to the screen, adding movement and color, the animators of Fullmetal Alchemist made confident decisions and created an anime version of the original artwork that was both creative and respectful of what came before.

In short, Fullmetal Alchemist is a masterpiece in almost every way, and I highly recommend it to anyone.",1435708800,,3842,4.859541984732824

It has an amazing story, great characters, beautiful music, and a nice art style.

Don't get this confused with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  They are different series.  This one originally aired while the manga was still going so about half way through the series they took some liberties and took the story in their own direction. Brotherhood on the other hand, came out after the manga had finished and follows the manga story very closely.  If you are only willing to watch one, I recommend Brotherhood over this one but they are both masterpieces in my mind.

The animation is fantastic, a great dub as well. There is a very well done mix of action, drama, and comedy, a single episode will have you crying, laughing, and on the edge of your seat. The overall plot is well done as well, the final 6 episodes of this season are spectacular.
Now for the flaws, Ed and Al are very well developed, but the other side characters are very much left in the dust, and most will barely get developed at all, even into the second season. The middle episodes seem to drag on a bit and don't offer much plot, but this is a very short break. Ultimately though, the biggest issue with Fullmetal Alchemist, is the existence of its younger brother, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It so far surpasses the original in terms of quality that the tiny little flaws of the original seem to come more readily to the surface. So I will say this now:
  WATCH FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST BEFORE BROTHERHOOD
This show is a true classic that you have to experience to for yourself. Whether you like anime or not, this should be near the top of everyone's must watch list.",1391040000,,1376,4.413385826771654

3663549,5,B001K98M78,"This series is the best any television show - not just anime - can be. Possibly the best anime series out there. A consistent, mildly heavy tone, with an absolutely perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. There is one minute complaint I have, though. Please, don't let this, detract you from purchasing this. I'd just like to say something about about it. In The Other Brothers Elric Part 1, I felt the English voice-over for Fletcher was disappointing. I had only ever heard the Japanese version, before, and maybe I just expected it to be more dramatic. Maybe Mike was taking a different approach. I don't know. But, like I said before, don't let this, AT ALL, change your mind about purchasing this.

It a beautiful display of devastatingly meaningful poetry in motion. Though it doesn't stick to the manga, it manages to tell the magnificent story of the Elric brothers almost better than the manga does. It's perfectly paced and incredibly animated. The Most impressive part, for me, is how the ten million different details spread throughout the series, many of which not in the manga, manage to fit perfectly into the story. The voice cast is wonderful as well with every member of the team giving powerful and unforgettable performances. All in all, FMA is easily one of the greatest anime shows there ever was.

I would not recommend it for younger than 12 or 13.",1388016000,2,466,4.559523809523809
3663557,5,B001K98M78,"Okay, so I bought season 1 (this boxset) a few months ago thinking, 'it's inexpensive right now, it's popular, and I need to watch it someday, but I probably won't get so into it that I feel the need to own the rest of it, right?' and then, I watched an episode 3 days ago. I finished the series in about 2.5 days, and would have done it faster if I hadn't been sick and unable to sit up the whole time. I'm so excited about it that I even wanna show my mom this series! I think she'll like it since her and I are fans of Supernatural, and this is pretty similar in a way.

This next part is so parents can know what's in it, or so that kids who have seen a little of the series can know whether they'd need to watch it in secret or out in the open.

For those of you who want to know of the general content, it has some cursing in it, but they never say the f-word (can't remember if they ever said the s-word, but they said the d-word and b*****d a lot). There's quite a bit of violence, but I wouldn't call anything in this series scary. There's no romance (a nice change of pace for me), there's no ecchi (which means no panties or naked boobs or softcore sex), but there is one scene where someone accidentally grabbed someone else's boob one time, but he immediately got away from her and apologized profusely (I'd say which character, but I don't wanna spoil anything. Not that that scene is some sort of major series turner or something, which it isn't). Also, there are lots of things like government conspiracies and religious cults (don't worry. If you're a Christian like me, their god is like the sun god or other stuff like that. Just treat it as a good story and ignore it. If you are a kid reading this and thought you wanted to show it to your parents and they're psycho-religious, you may wanna keep this hidden just to be safe). And naturally, as it says in the title, there's Alchemy. So they're drawing circles and using magic type stuff, mixed with tons of scientific knowledge (to the parents, know they're not chanting to Satan--or anyone in that matter--I swear).

The voice acting is AWESOME. I had recently finished rewatchign Ouran High School Host Club, and I knew that the same guy who does Tamaki in english also does Edward, so I thought ""I wanna hear him talk some more"" so I watched the series. I almost NEVER watch a series in English first (I rarely watch them in English at ALL but this was truly special).

*****This next part contains some spoilers. If you're not okay with spoilers, it'd be good to skip this part.*****

The series starts off showing Ed and Al using Alchemy when they were about five years younger or so. They were trying to bring back their mother by using the forbidden human transmutation, and Al ended up having his body sucked into a vortext. It is later explained that Ed had to literally give an arm and a leg to save Al, and he bound his little brother's soul to the armor in the corner of the room, which is really hard for Alchemists to do.

Then, after that, it skips ahead five years for two episodes (and you almost feel like you're being thrown into the middle of the series instead of having more of an explanation first), and then they go back to when they were kids and explain what really happened (which I just spoiled above), and also how Edward got his leg and arm made of metal (which is called auto mail). Over time, things are explained about how Edward became a state alchemist when he was only twelve, and things carry on from there.

That's really all I needed to say. As for the opening and ending theme songs, there is one opening them for the first half of season 1 (didn't care too much for it), one ending theme for the first part (can't remember it), the second ending theme song (Ready Steady Go, which I love) and the second ending theme song which whenever I watch it, it always sets the mood for the next episode perfectly. I love the music, but I stayed for the story, basically. I regret nothing.

The only thing I regret is not already having the second season in my possession, and not having the money to buy Brotherhood, which is two boxsets after season 2. (I convinced my mom to buy it because it went down to a little over 12 bucks). When I get in season 2, I'll own 51 episodes of it. It'll be the longest anime I have ever owned so far, and as I keep collecting, the most expensive, too.

Sorry for this long, rambling review. I hope it did you some good, and helped you decide whether you would be interested in it or not for the content. it's hilarious when it's trying to be funny, when it's sad it's tear jerking, when it's dark, it's SUPER dark. This series did everything right (I just wish that all the episodes of every season, plus the OVAs and movies, were in one boxset).

3663564,5,B001K98M78,"Television Review: Fullmetal Alchemist
By Skyler Flewellen

The popular Japanese manga series Fullmetal Alchemist is still growing in popularity today. It has gained much fame in Western society and, of course, in Japan. The series includes the original Japanese manga, two animated television shows, two animated films, novels, and several video games.
The manga series was written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa, and it lasted from August 2001 to June 2010. Bones Studio ran both of the anime television shows. The original aired from 2003 to 2004 with 51 episodes. The second anime show, which was a remake of the original, was entitled Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and it aired from 2009 to 2010 with 64 episodes. The two theatrical films came out at the end of their respected shows: one at the end of the original series and the other at the end of the second.
The story behind Fullmetal Alchemist follows the lives of the two Elric brothers: Edward, the older brother, Alphonse, the younger brother. It takes place in an industrial European style world where alchemy is the most advanced science and it is used in every aspect of life, to acquire more knowledge and expand scientific research. The first show had its own original story and loosely followed the manga, whereas the second show followed the manga's story almost exactly.
The story begins with very little back-story, where the two brothers are attempting to use alchemy to bring their mother back to life. Alchemy follows a basic principle of Equivalent and Exchange. To create something, something of equal value must be lost. The brothers, in their ignorance and naivety, study Human Transmutation, a forbidden art of alchemy, where one attempts to modify or create a human being. The attempt fails, and Edward loses his right arm. Alphonse loses his entire body. In an attempt to save his brother, Edward sacrifices his left leg to attach his brother's soul to a suit of armor.
After this incident, a State Alchemist named Roy Mustang meets the boys and tells them that Edward should try to become a State Alchemist like him. Edward would then have access to advanced research materials that will help them get their bodies back. Edwards gets his limbs replaced by advanced prosthetics called automail, which are robotic arms and legs. Edward and Alphonse begin their journey to Central, the headquarters of the State, and Edward passes his State Alchemy Exam. The brothers begin their pursuit of the legendary Philosopher's Stone, a mystical alchemic artifact that maximizes the user's alchemy and allows them to do almost anything. It even gives them a shot at Human Transmutation. The brothers seek the stone not to bring their mother back again, but to restore their bodies to their former state. After seeing what Edward is capable of through his unique style of alchemy and automail limbs, the leader of the State, the Fuhrer, gives Edward the title of Fullmetal: the Fullmetal Alchemist.
This series is for anyone who is interested in manga or anime shows. Its fame has spread across the world as one of the best animes of all time. It is very hard to give this series any negative feedback, but the only flaw worth mentioning is that the original show did not stay as true to the manga as the second did. With that being said, they are both amazing shows in their art form, and it is up to you to decide which you like better.",1378598400,,3416,4.879518072289157

3663572,5,B001K98M78,"When Edward and Alfonse Elric lose their mother to a deadly sickness, they commit alchemy's one forsaken law, human transmutation, in hopes of bringing her back to life. The result is horrific. Ed loses an arm and leg, and his little brother, Al, loses his entire body. Ed manages by a last ditch effort to bond Al's soul to an empty suit of armor to save him.

  The two become state alchemists and set out on a quest in search of the mythical ""Philosopher's Stone"" in hopes of getting their bodies back, and must face the consequences of their sins along the way.

  This series has an enthralling narrative, complex emotional, philosophical and scientific ideas, and some pretty bad-ass fight scenes. Character complexity is also a plus. The ending of this series is one of the most complex and unexpected endings I've seen.

  My final recommendation? Grab this title today...

I know some people hate that it doesn't follow the manga after a certain point and Brotherhood did. But I find the differences between Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood to be really interesting.

I have aspects in both I both like and dislike.

For instance and the below is a spoiler if you don't already know, so beware.

I liked how in Fullmetal Alchemist they made Envy Dante's son and Ed's half brother. For me that was a very interesting twist, as well as how homunculi came about.

In Brotherhood I liked the more action type things, such as Alchimists vs Homunculas. I also like how the Xing people were there. ^^

All in all I more or less view Fullmetal Alchemist as an alternate universe or so of the happenings in the manga.

I know there are people out there who argue back and forth over one being better then the other. But I personally enjoy both for very different reasons. I say give it a try and see for yourselves what a good series this is.

One other thing. Brotherhood is more serious/dark while Fullmetal Alchemist is more comical/drama. Just deppends on your likes. ^^",1365811200,,1180,4.59047619047619

3663587,5,B001K98M78,"I have been an FMA fan since its early days on Adult Swim--and to be fair, I have owned this original series, own the entire manga series and also own Brotherhood and BOTH theatrical releases. I'd say I'm in a position to make a pretty fair judgement on the two series...and I personally believe the Original Series outshines the manga/FMA-B, even though the manga/FMA-B are the 'authorized vision"" of the original creator, Arakawa...but hear me out on this, please.

The Manga, whose story diverges from THIS original series after the encounter between Hughes and Envy, was far from completed when this series was developed. The original anime was created with the author's full approval and cooperation. Arakawa even revealed the final plot elements that would conclude the story and there are some references to them if you're familiar with both stories (ex: Mustang's 'vision', the Ed's alchemic abilities at the end of both stories,etc). However, it was clear that the series would be one side of the FMA story, while Arakawa's as-yet-not-even-half-finished masterpiece would continue.

What is the essential difference--plot and characters aside? Why is the Original Series considered to be better by so many fans?
Simple. FMA The Manga/FMA Brotherhood was published in a young teen monthly manga digest(Shounen Gangan). It was aimed at a target audience of young people and older children, even though it became hugely popular world wide with audiences of all ages. The Original Series seems to be shooting for an older viewing audience, and the developed scripts and storyline and plotting reflect that.

The manga's 'evil' was a meglomaniac supernatural being unleashed upon the world and determined to become a god, with humanity as little more than a useable resource. Like Dragonball Z, our heroes have to ""go Super Saiyan"" to save the world. For a Shounen/Young Adult manga plotline, that's workable. Some adult readers/viewers may find it formulaic and may feel dissatisifed by the neat,""happily ever after"" elements of the awkward ending. It's man vs Supernatural Menace.

The evil in the Original Series comes from within the human nature. The quest for immortality that triggers the events in the manga (the King of Xerxes and the Creature in the Flask) is scaled on a human level--Dante and Hohenheim's quest for eternal life. It is humans that create the Sins through the folly of attempting to return the dead to life--not a supernatural madman and his human minions. At every turn, evil is the consequence of human greed, hubris and ignorance and nothing will ever match the horror of Edward learning the truth about Sloth and his helplessness in the face of that truth. Time and again, it all falls back on human responsiblity and human failure...and is redeemed by humans willing to sacrifice anything and everything to restore the balance again.

It's that depth of storytelling, for me personally, places this original series above the manga/brotherhood storyline. Rather than the vision of the comic artist, it is the work of screen writers and I find it far more compelling. I'm sure a lot of people will strongly disagree and Funimation is certainly doing all it can to get the original series out of the catalog and out of memory--but it won't work for the fans that love this--which is why I bought two complete series box sets--one to watch and one to lend to friends.

This has no ""happy"" ending--it is bittersweet and stunning and ultimately satisfying.",1361664000,2,3486,5.064459930313589

While I like Brotherhood better (it adheres to the original manga, and thus it makes a ton more sense than the original series), I still adore this. Brotherhood may be more well-rounded, but this original series fills in some of the holes and gaps that Brotherhood has. Plus, since the beginning is longer, it seems to have a few more funny moments than Brotherhood. 9(Who could forget Mustang and his ""mini skirts""?!?!) And a lot of the content is really interesting, and I wished it had been a part of the Brotherhood as well - i.e. how Homunculi are created, Envy's past, etc. As much as I love Brotherhood, this will always have a special place in my heart.",1358121600,,786,4.621428571428571

3663597,4,B001K98M78,"I love FMA. I recommend it over the newer Brotherhood series, but I won't go into that. Fullmetal Alchemist has a beautiful storyline. I'm not much of a crier, but this anime has jerked a couple tears out of me. I usually tend to look for animes that have either a good storyline or alot of comedy, since honestly alot only have one or the other. But FMA has a beautiful blend of action, comedy, character development, and emotion. It's not the cheesy violence and constant rude humor that draws in shallow fans. It has a deep and intriguing story. It's realistic, with victory and failure, sorrow and joy. Everything doesn't always end happy for everyone, and though we may not like it, that's the way FMA portrays things. This is a very well developed anime. The artwork and soundtrack are also beautiful.

That said, I do have my own personal issues with it (that I realize may not be relevant to others, but I'd like to include). Although it isn't riddled with rude humor (which I greatly appreciate), it does have other content that I'm not pleased with. FMA has a large amount of language that I don't think is suitable for the age group it's meant for, and alot of gore. I realize it's just being realistic (something I praised it for before), but I think it could have done without it. I also realize that this is a trademark of anime, and it comes with the territory. But I still think it deserves a warning.

My summary: A beautiful anime (better than most I've seen), but beware of the questionable content.",1354752000,,1518,4.536496350364963

Fullmetal Alchemist is about 15 year old Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric, two alchemists who performed taboo while trying to bring back their dead mother. As a result of their taboo, they travel across the country Amestris, trying to restore the limbs they had lost. This season 1 box-set includes both the English Dub by Funimation and the Original Japanese (with English Subtitles). Out of all the anime, the voicing on both versions is amazing! You can hear the emotion in both versions, and the wording isn't awkward. Overall,
Pros:
+ Amazing Storyline
  +Lovable Characters
  +Medium Length (not too long or short with 56 episodes, 25 on season 1)
+ Good English Dub and Sub (there are lots of bad dubs out there)
+ Clean-cut Animaton
+ Content (about 600 minutes in just Season 1)

Cons:
- Not many special features

3663610,5,B001K98M78,"I bought this a while ago but wanted to finish the first season to review it. Full metal Alchemist is new my favorite series ( as my title says) The story follows brother Edward and Alphonse Elric. There mother died when they were young, i know sounds cliched right? well it's not there mother dying is more then just a pain they have to carry because it leads to a chain event of things that begin the series. The two are alchemist who can transform things with trans mutate metal objects and turn them into whatever they want. After there mother dies the two decide they want to bring here back to life using alchemy but it backfires because you can't exchange anything for human life. The two pay up dearly for the mistake Edward the older one loses his right arm and left foot and Alphonse,younger, loses his whole body! Ed thinks quick on his feet and puts his brother's soul into a suit of armor so he could save him (if you though transformers when you saw Al on the cover you'll be shocked like me) The two brothers start their quest to find the philosopher's stone which uses high level alchemy to get their missing body parts back. The whole anime is full of amazing characters Edward is funny, stubborn and just flat out cool. Alphonse is the  more childish sympathetic one and it's so ironic he's in a big scary suit of armor. The show has plenty of humor as well as phenomenal character development. None of them are without a story or feeling. The whole message of the show is what does it mean to be human and what are you willing to sacrifice. I would like to say the English cast is the best I've ever heard by the way. I would also like to give this a pg-13 rating and and say you will love it. i totally let all my love for FMA  out so this ran a little long  so bye hope i was of some help!",1323129600,,1810,4.22543352601156

3663616,5,B001K98M78,"I am not going to lie. I used to be an FMA hater and back then I would see this show on TV, watch whichever random episode they were playing, and then wonder why this anime was so popular. To me, it seemed to have a really dark story and that put me off. (Please understand. This was way back when I was really into Naruto, lol.) It also bothered me that it only partially fallow the manga which is not such a big deal to me now but once was a very big deal to me. So when I found out about FMA: Brotherhood I was really excited and I said to myself, ""Yes! Now I can just watch this and pretend the first FMA never happened."" Needless to say, the guilt started to set in as the release of FMA Brotherhood loomed closer and closer. It just felt wrong watching the second series without giving the first a chance. So I swallowed my foolish pride and watched the entire original FMA from beginning to end and thank God that I did. I would have missed out on something truly magnificent. I can confidently say now that I hold no grudges against this great series. Thanks to this anime, FMA Brotherhood is my all time favorite show. I am so glad I decided to watch this first, had I not, I would not like the characters no where near as much. I felt I understood them a lot more and held a much deeper care for them after having watched the original. I am greatful to this show for setting the groundwork for my current favorite anime of all time. If you plan on watching FMA Brotherhood I strongly recommend picking up this series first. If you have never seen this show, WATCH IT! If you have never heard of this show, WATCH IT! Do not make the same mistake I almost did, WATCH FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST.

I especially like how the main characters Edward and Alphonse are brothers and how they work together toward their ultimate goal, but I won't bore you with the plot. Odds are, you've read the product description.
Because I like to inform people of this type of stuff, I'll explain now that this is NOT a kid's show. Violence, much of it bloody, is common. There's a lot of profanity as well, but it's mostly mild words like ""dang"" and ""heck"" with the occasional ""illegitimate child."" There is one mild sex scene and scattered innuendo (though mostly mild). And there's some nudity, but most of it is non-sexual.

That is, until Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood came out.  To make room, this one had to be dropped down to four stars. Now Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood holds the rank of being *the* 5 star anime. But that is because Brotherhood exceeded it, not because it is any less worthy than before.

Fullmetal Alchemist parallels Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood for the first half, about.  Basically, all the development chapters. At that point, they diverge greatly.  Story has it that by the time they got to the midway point, they had caught up with the manga as far as it had been published, and from there on had to create a new story.  The story they created was magnificent, with meaning and depth, with conflicts and struggles both internal and external.  This is an anime that I feel comfortable suggesting to just about anyone, with one cautioned exception.

If you are a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I can't recommended this storyline.  While this may be one of the best anime I have seen, Brotherhood exceeded this in so many ways that this one will probably be disappointing.

Much like funimations recent blu-ray ""S.A.V.E."" sets, they are just repackaged anime series in cheaper form to allow people with more limited budgets to get the anime's they would like.  I don't own the original set, but this set contains all the special features identified on the original set, and the picture and audio quality are all top notch (though I'm not a fan of the fact that I can't skip over the advertisements when the disc is initially started).  So, if you're interest in Fullmetal Alchemist, and would like to save some money, this is the way to go.

As to the show, it is a rather amazing show, filled with humor, action, tragedy, and some of the best characterization (and twists) I've seen in an anime.  I have to warn you, if you start it, you're probably not going to want to stop watching it until you're finished.  The story progresses nicely, and things you didn't understand before become more clear as the show progresses.  The only complaint I really have with the series is that it ends.

3663630,4,B001K98M78,"Fullmetal Alchemist The Complete First Season is a four-disc set that contains the first twenty-five episodes of the series.  The first disc contains seven episodes, the second disc contains six episodes, the third disc contains six episodes and a commentary on episode nineteen, and the fourth disc contains six episodes, a commentary on episode twenty-five, and the extras.

The first extra included on the fourth disc is labeled as ""Japanese Commercials.""  However, it turns out that this feature only contains one commercial, which lasts for a whole seventeen seconds.  When I discovered that was the extent of the ""Japanese Commercials,"" I felt that the label on this feature was misleading and a form of ""false advertising.""

The next feature is the music video for ""Ready, Steady, Go,"" by L'Arc-en-Ciel, which is the second opening theme song for Fullmetal Alchemist.  The music video primarily features the actual band, with some shots featuring an animated version of the band.  However, nothing in the video ties in to Fullmetal Alchemist.  The third special feature is a commercial for Tofu Records, the label that released ""Ready, Steady, Go.""  The commercial runs for seventeen seconds, and it is an ad for L'Arc-en-Ciel's album that features the song.

The next feature on the disc is the textless openings and closings.  Both of the openings and both of the closings that appear on this set are included.  While the credit text may not be included, you still get the subtitles if you're watching the set with the Japanese audio.  The final extra on the fourth disc are trailers.

When this DVD set was put together, FUNimation included the booklets from the first six individual discs that were released.  However, since only four episodes were released on each of the individual discs, there are only episode write-ups for the first twenty-four episodes.  Each booklet contains a write-up from someone associated with the Japanese production, character information and images, information from the series, artwork, and episode write-ups.  The booklets are very well-done and contain a lot of information.

The quality of the series, as well as the booklets included in the set, more than make up for the very minor flaws of this release.  If you're a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, then this box set should be a part of your DVD collection.

In order to write this review, I watched a copy of this DVD box set that was given to me as a gift by my husband.",1283817600,2,2468,4.9731707317073175

I watched the first couple episodes and decided to buy this. It's a great story, you really care about what happens to the character and what goes on with they're quest. So a little background.

The story is revolved around Ed and Alphonse Elric and they're quest to find the Philosopher's Stone. They lost their mother and they tried to bring her back with Alchemy but wound up failing and paid the price for they're mistakes. So now they go around searching for The Philosopher's Stone to fix they're mistakes. It's a interesting story, most of the time on they're search they wind up in different situations and wind up helping the people there with they're Alchemy.

I would consider this more of a Drama more then Action, but that makes it all the better. You care what actually happens with Ed and Al and other people in the series. All the character are pretty unique and funny in their own way. For example, A Major named Armstrong that's extremely buff but he acts very feminine which makes his character pretty funny. The action is pretty cool as well, especially when Alchemy is involved. The show is pretty smart in the way they talk about science and Alchemy I think.

I'm glad I purchased the show, I went through it so fast and had to buy the second season right after. I would suggest this to anyone new to Anime or anyone who likes Anime and has not seen this show. I've talked to a lot of people and this is definitley one of the best Animes out there. I think it's worth the price as well, it comes with 6 pamphlets as well they give you different facts on the characters and different pictures.

Buy this if you want a great and unforgettable story check this out I promise you won't be dissapointed.",1280016000,,1840,4.4188790560471976

3663639,4,B001K98M78,"Well, if you seen my review for the second season set, it's the same for this one as well.
So if your a fan of fullmetal alchemist, I encourage you to buy this in hopes that the lady who made the original manga can get some money off this awesome series.",1271030400,,254,4.0
3663640,5,B001K98M78,"I am kind of particular on the series that I spend my time with and I must say this is one of my favorite story lines I have ever watched.  It definitely pulls the viewer into the story and makes you feel for the characters.  I bought this after watching 3 episodes on TV and now I am hooked.  It is one of those shows where you will say you'll only watch one episode, but after each episode you have to watch another to see what happens.  I just wait for the second season to arrive on my doorstep to get to the ending.",1269129600,,520,3.9711538461538463

3663642,4,B001K98M78,"Full metal alchemist is a perfect anime, especially for someone who is a little bit new to watching anime and is just getting a feel for it. It has a perfect mix of drama, conspiracy, and humour to make it not only a form of entertainment, but it's also just fun!

The drama comes from interpersonal relationships between the characters. Most of the central characters in the show have very detailed back stories and there is major depth in antecedent events that you learn about at a good pace to keep you interested. Comedy comes mostly from the hot-headedness of Edward and the events that result from his weak control of his own temper. Conspiracy is drawn from the governing body of the realm in which the story takes place, which seems to be something of a military totalitarianistic system, and past events involving brutal war crimes and covered up incidents.

This is a great set to get for those who are new to the show and those who are not particularly interested in special features. On the dvd's there are pretty much none, except for an anime trailer on each disk. To account for this, instead, each box set has a box of ""guidebooks"" which, on brief initial flip-through, bascially outline the details of the world of fullmetal alchemist. I was a little disappointed about this, but not really surprised, considering this is a box set of the entire season on 4 disks, and other versions are available, such as the four part box set and the individual volumes, which I can only assume include more special features. However, if you just want to watch the show, this is a great way to get value out of it. To buy this box set in a cd and dvd store can cost upwards of 80 bucks, the volumes individually can be up to 25, so this is value for your money!",1261785600,,1765,4.4953271028037385

3663644,5,B001K98M78,"Well I bought this show to watch with my little cousin cause she likes anime and cartoons and all that and I figured ""Fullmetal Alchemist thats a big hit she would probley enjoy that"" and plus it was made by funimation and they have alot of good shows.  I had obviously never seen the show I started watching it with her and by the second episode I was sitting  there thinking man her mom would not like her watching this the show is very very dark and depressing at times but there are some good moral values in the show like the Brotherly love between Ed and Al and stuff like that but I wouldnt recomend letting your younger ones watching this show that being said I loved the show ive watched both seasons and its a great show Im almost in my twentys and I enjoyed it its not a kids show by far yes it looks like it but its not like i said its dark very dark and thats what I love.  There is a heavy story which im not going to go into detail about but there are times where it gets really sad but it is definatly worth a watch check it out but watch it first to see if you think its good for your young ones",1260489600,2,1112,3.977578475336323

8314350,5,B001K98M78,"I watched this series when it original aired on Cartoon Network. I am happy that I now own it so I can view it at any time. For those who purchase this series it varies  from the second one called brotherhood which remains faithful to the original manga. This series however is still great because it offer an alternative version of what could have been if things had progressed different for the characters. So  from my prospective both series are great to own in regards to story telling, and voice acting work.",1478044800,,513,4.565217391304348

It's also a very emotional show, and touches upon some very dark subject matter. Anyways, I highly recommend this product.",1475884800,,398,4.685714285714286
