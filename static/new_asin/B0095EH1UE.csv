5262702,5,B0095EH1UE,"My daughter was extremely excited and the movies play very well. If you do not know much about part 2. Jane the daughter of Wendy starts growing up a little too fast since her dad had to deploy for war. This part always makes my daughter cry because it reminds her of all the times her daddy had to deploy. So, if you like Peter Pan you will like part 2, but of course there are changes. There is no crocodile in part 2, but if you can over look that then you should enjoy it. :)",1438300800,,479,3.948453608247423

5262704,5,B0095EH1UE,"Great two movie set as others have said. If you want Peter Pan this is a great way to get it.

There is however a dark side, this is NOT the US version of Peter Pan and although it is region free and will play in your USA player, you will not be able to redeem the Disney Movie Rewards Points on your US account. This did nothing to change my opinion of the movie or quality of the product, but it is something I would have liked to know up front. I do not know if the editing of the movie is different but seeing that I haven't seen the movie in 40 years I might be wrong. This version appears to be the UK version judging by the UK web address and language default being English.",1423699200,8,681,3.9347826086956523

I don't have that option and this movie was meant to play in my van for the kids on road trips. They did accept the return but charged me a 10% restocking fee and I had to pay to return it.
