7932701,1,B000056VZ0,"First, a little background on why I purchased this extremely lame film, ""High School Ghosthustlers."" I purchase many of my Japanese films not only from amazon, but also from various Asian Cinema stores in my area. Now, when I first bought this film a few years ago, one look at the cover and reading the back of the DVD told me right off the bat that I was probably wasting my time with this film. However, one of the customers in the store, who was from Japan, informed me that this was a great film not to be missed. He sure saw me coming. Anyway, I know the proprietors of the video store, who sort of hinted to me that this was probably not a good film, as they know my likes and dislikes. But hey, I buy a lot of DVDs from Japan [especially if the price is great], and many without first viewing them. Some are great, others mediocre: This one I regretted.

The film has some stellar reviews here with a few exceptions: Mainly the spotlight reviewer [David Koski]. And he gives an astute review of the film. Also, the DVD itself is not very good. This is not horror, but rather horror-ible. Save yourself some money, this film is Lame with a capital 'L'. Was I disappointed? You bet. This is a film that would have made Ed Wood blush. Yes, it's that bad. The film deals with a High School built on a once former brothel, which in turn leads to hauntings. Enter three young attractive girls, [including model Senna Matsuda as Kyoko] who must battle these [borrowing a phrase] ""erotomaniac spirits,"" who haunt the school. They belong to a club which combats evil spirits, and they are asked to investigate the hauntings of a local High School. The acting is bad, and the special effects even worse. This film is Bad with a capital 'B'. Stay away from this one, as it is a total waste of money and time.

Also, this is not a film for young kids. I would not let my daughters view it as it does have content that is not appropriate for young kids. However, I really don't think young kids would be impressed with this film anyway. I am sure they would be able to see through this stinker of a film no matter what. I never write scathing reviews like this one, but this film was just awful. And the writing is just as bad as the cinematography. I do not know how this film received such glowing reviews, but it is definitely one to stay away from. If you have to watch it, rent it first. Then purchase it if it's your taste in films. One thing is for sure, I thought it was bad when I first viewed it years ago, and time has not changed my opinion. This was my second and final viewing. I am sure it will collect dust in my storage or garage for many a years to come. Once again, it is bad with a captial 'B'. Not recommended.",1177200000,,2726,4.250481695568401
7932702,4,B000056VZ0,"The idea behind the movie is that three girls have started a club that deals with ghosts, ghouls and the supernational.  Their teachers keep asking them to deal with the problems within their own school and in others.  They finally meet their match in a very poverful ghost who, in life, was a very rich and very perverted man who enjoyed visiting the brothels.  And now, even in death, he wants to have the pleasure of you-know-want.

It is funny, sexy and, yes once I did jump back in surprise.  Once.  Most of the time I just found the thing a delight to watch.  The one point has been taken away because the whole thing feels like somebody did it with a bad video camera.  I've seen XXX-Rated films with more money poured into them.  But, frankly, they didn't turn out as good.

Try to get it, but better watch out, even used it cost me a lot.",1163635200,2,847,4.30379746835443
7932703,4,B000056VZ0,"DVD of a Japanese TV series featuring gorgeous supermodel Senna Matsuda and two other lesser Japanese babe icons. Basically a low budget Ghostbusters set in high school with heavy sexual overtones. High school built on site of haunted whorehouse leads to schoolgirls becoming sexually possessed causing nudity, promiscuity, and phallic slugs crawling around the restrooms. (Rather like Cronenberg's Shivers!).
Our three heroines are members of a high school paranormal society who are called in to fight the sexual evil. Budget is real low, so the ghostbusting equipment looks like vaccums with flashing lights on em. The penis like slugs are grossly well done, but everything else looks bargain basement.... There is some (topless) nudity but entirely from other bit role actresses. Minimal violence. No obscenity, but definitely not for kids.
Despite it's cheapness, this is not filmed poorly. Sound is fine, though only in 2 channel stereo. Film quality is excellent. In Japanese with well done English subtitles. No extra features.
Recommended? Yes---plot is actually reasonably intricate (more so than the average Buffy episode), the penis monsters have a huge amount of camp appeal, and the heroines are most easy to look at. And Ms Matsuda is garbed in a bikini and shorts at one point, which can only be a good thing! Not Citizen Kane, or even Ghostbusters, but worth a look for fans of low budget horror and Japanese pop culture.",1015200000,4,1438,5.175965665236052
7932704,1,B000056VZ0,"After watching this movie a total of 1.5 times, and talking to some of my friend who I have let borrow it, we have come to the conclusion that Ghosthustlers is, in fact, porn with a plot.  And you know, the sad thing is, my friends and I are 14/15 years old, just buying it to look for something funny.
The movie quality, itself, is bad too!  The picture looks like a comcorder and the sound is nothing different.
I'm a big supporter of TokyoPop and thats why I initially bought this, but please, KEEP YOUR MONEY!",1015027200,2,513,4.278350515463917
7932705,1,B000056VZ0,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it did not even meet my low expectations.  The movie description on the buying info page is accurate enough, but what they don't tell you is how lame it comes off.  When this movie starts up, you will wonder if you somehow got somebody's home video burned on to DVD.  The video quality is shockingly bad with noticable pixelization (strangely, the bit rate is very high and I did not notice much in the way of compression artifacts).  There is a cheesy quality to the video that makes me think of camcorders in the back yard.  The audio has a similar lack of professional quality.  In some scenes there is noticable echo from the room they are shooting in.
The plot, dialogue, and acting are of similar quality.  The plot is kind of a mix between Ghostbusters and some sort of USA Up All Night flick (with slightly less censoring), except [worse].  Most slasher movie directors would be ashamed to have such a poorly put together movie!  Oh, and the special effects were some of the worst I have ever seen.  They would have been better off with guys under sheets.
Don't buy this movie, I am very sorry that I did.
If you are interested in Asian supernatural movies, check out Mr. Vampire instead.  It is a Chinese vampire movie and it is very good.",1013299200,4,1293,4.482905982905983
7932706,5,B000056VZ0,"OK, this movie looks pretty funny on the shelf of an online store.  I mean, the heroins are super models, and it has ghosts and its supposedly funny.  'Ghosthustelrs' has is comical moments, but online, they fail to tell people that this is not a COMEDY movie, but EROTIC COMEDY/HORROR movie.  Changes things, ne?  I don't want to ruin the movie for y'all because its pretty good, but lemme just point out some things that you should know when buying this:
 1) THERE IS NUDITY..DON""T WATCH WITH PARENTS
2) The monsters are SLIMY reproductions of the ""male organ"" (pretty gross, yeah)
3) There is lots of sexual sighing and things, so don't watch when parents could hear.
4) They DO swear.
5) I RATE IS A VERY VERY HARD PG-13.  Think twice about buying this. I'm only warning you!! The movies itslef, was made pretty well, I mean, good plot line and all.
Know I know most of you have read of bout...'a mixture of Sailor Moon and Ghostbusters...'  What they don't include in that combo is Sex and the City.  It SHOULD read like this '...a sick mixture of Sailor Moon, Sex and the City, and Ghostbusters...'
Considers yourselfs warned and in all seriousness...THIS SHOULD BE RATED LIKE 16 AND UP!",996192000,15,1193,4.59433962264151
7932707,1,B000056VZ0,"This movie is nasty! I don't suggest young kids to view this movie at all! It starts out cute then the sex crazy demons come and take over the body of women. Allowing them to control men, once they have sex with them, they kill them.",989798400,,233,4.086956521739131
