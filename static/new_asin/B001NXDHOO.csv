3723943,4,B001NXDHOO,Very good collection. The penguins are an odd group that compel you to watch whatever they are going to do next. Great for an all day movie treat.,1238198400,,146,4.25
3723944,4,B001NXDHOO,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who's just crazy about the Madagascar movies and Penguin short films. I know the price is a bit ho-ho, specially since this is a new release. The freight and tax to have it sent to the philippines caused the price to almost triple. I also agree with the other amazon members who commented that Dreamworks shouldn't have made a separate DVD for the Penguins of Madagascar. It's like daylight robbery and your victims are your own loyal fans. Talk about capitalism on the extreme. Anyway, with all the yapping on the price and what-nots, all I can say is that my wife really liked the gift. And in fairness, the contents of the DVDs are a great enjoyment for us grown-ups and for the kids. So I guess a 4-star is still in order.",1236729600,3,762,4.335664335664336

3723988,5,B001NXDHOO,"I bought these DVDs separately ... but I have got to say the series is one of my all time FAVORITES! Its a good changer... feeling blue, tired of the weather, broke up with your BFF? Ha! This is the remedy!

The series is best watched in order -- because you would miss some of the humor if you don't now the narrative and the characters.... but I have watched each one multiple times. I think maybe I like the last one best, so very upbeat and the music is great.

Love, love, love it that King Julian (my favorite character maybe... even though he's a major pain in the b*tt egotist who reminds me of one of my coworkers I do not like)... is finally humbled... but I won't tell you the details so I don't spoil it for you! Priceless.

WATCH it, you won't be disappointed. And there is nothing in this series I see an in appropriate for both kids and grown ups so fun for a family to watch together.",1474588800,,900,4.160919540229885
