8361408,5,B002BI4JM4,"Perfect documentary for me and my son, who are fascinated by snakes.  This documentary followed 2 researchers in their quest to find the biggest anaconda while doing DNA research.  Did not present th anaconda in a terrifying, monster like way that some shows do.",1506816000,,262,4.931818181818182
8361409,5,B002BI4JM4,This is a really great movie on snakes and the lifestyle of Anaconda's in particular. If snakes are what you like you you're interested in knowing everything about Anaconda's then this is the movie for you!,1343692800,,206,4.75
8361410,4,B002BI4JM4,"This Smithsonian Networks made for tv video has a lot of info, history and myth about these giant snakes.  Taking you deep into the Amazon basin and Yanos of Guyana and filming on land and underwater hunt for the largest of these massive snakes, with the help of renouned experts in the field.  The interviews with eye witness accounts of the indiginous natives, make this a compelling and riviting documentery.  My only dissapointment was the unanswered question of weather the reward offered ( in the 1930s ) of $50,000 by New Yorks, Museum of Natural History, for anyone bringing back a snake of over 30 feet in length was ever collected.  Many stories of snakes up to 100 feet in length, but no proof.  Still many of these anacondas filmed in this documentary are massive and certainly reach over 20' in length with a couple approaching the legendary 30' mark.  A very engaging DVD.  Well worth the $5.23 including shipping, that I paid.  Joe In San Francisco",1324857600,,963,4.724550898203593
8361411,1,B002BI4JM4,"what I expect when I buy a nature documentary is to watch nature itself, with no special effects or human acting
and there is no subtitles. I am almost deaf and I need subtitles",1309824000,,177,4.235294117647059
8361412,3,B002BI4JM4,"This was an OK show. Light on action shots of the animals in question, heavy on shots of the crew preparing for shots. When they did show the animals, the photography was not engrossing. It felt like many of the ""natural"" shots were setups, like a scripted reality series. I was entertained, but am very glad I found this for ~$5. If it had been much more, I would have been disappointed.",1268956800,2,388,4.402777777777778
