7816918,3,6301884361,"Toward the end of the Cold War period, a spate of Soviet Russian books, and some films as well, were exported to the United States, as an attempt to make the Russian Communist system of government increasingly accessible to Americans, and this affair is one of the better products of the time, a wide screen item that was very well-received within the U.S.S.R. during 1982, as over 33 million people viewed it there.  Its popularity, despite few plot surprises, and a dearth of convincing characters, is derived from the work's blend of quotidian military life with an extensive display of the latest Soviet armed forces technology, all intensified by serviceable direction and playing.  The film opens with Soviet military personnel parting from their families as they leave for a routine training mission that promises little action, followed by scenes of the men's wives discussing the career directions of their husbands, who are assigned to a combination naval air/sea squadron,  Soon after embarkation, the squadron flagship receives a radioed distress message from an American nuclear powered submarine and responds by deploying a squadron salvage plane as an offer of assistance to the submarine's location.  The U.S. sub is holding a guilty secret: a nuclear payload consisting of numerous cruise-type missiles directed at the U.S.S.R., and the salvage plane crew is prevented by force of arms from boarding the vessel, as ordered by the submarine commander.  This worthy, in response to an inquiry from the Soviet admiral, discloses that a computer malfunction has resulted in an unplanned launching of two missiles targeted at the U.S.S.R. mainland, a disastrous event that will undoubtedly be the cause of World War III.  The computer breakdown was directly caused by an American submariner who, while attempting to repair the craft's mechanical problem, was exposed to an excessive dosage of radiation, ostensibly losing his mind as a result, and purposefully sabotaging the sub's control system, thereby requiring that an emergency command decision be made by the opposing skippers, one that we will expect to favour a course in line with the production's established Soviet bias, while being simultaneously acceptable to the Americans.  Director of photography Boris Bondarenko creates each of his compositions for this military melodrama with skill while director Mikhail Tumanishvili devises action episodes that advance a mood of suspense for a viewer, particularly those scenes that depict aircraft maneuvering as the rescue attempt is imminent.  The film's audio track is in Russian, with English subtitles, and a Slavic viewer who is paying heed will perceive that some Baltic nation dialects are also employed.  When speaking in English (dubbed), subtitles of that language are used as well, due to utilization of a Russian language voiceover that is distracting until one learns to accept this systemization.  It shall be noted that, although the picture's theme is of a U.S.S.R. naval squadron going to the aid of a crippled United States submarine, the film's primary plot elements deal with the squadron's air support arm.  This is decidedly a Soviet coloured late stage Cold War propagandistic piece, with a slightly muddled narrative, yet viewer interest will be heightened through the production's development of suspense that predominates over its cardinal motif.  On display is the magnanimity of the Soviets as opposed to U.S. authoritarianism, a turning of the coin from American films of the same era and genre.",1228608000,3,3545,5.333333333333333
7816919,3,6301884361,"Did you ever wonder, while watching ""Rambo lll"" or ""Red Dawn"", just what Soviet audiences had been watching about us?  ""Incident at Grid 36-80"" is a perfect example.  The synopsis:  A state-of-the-art American nuclear submarine is alone and far from home.  While spying on Warsaw Pact maneuvers, it suffers a reactor meltdown.  This in turn causes an accidental missile arming which imperiles the ships of the Soviet Navy, thereby threatening a retaliatory nuclear holocaust. The US military promises that its Captain will scuttle his own boat.  If not, the Russians will do it for him but, being humanitarians, will in any case rescue the hapless crew.  Nevertheless as Soviet carriers hurry toward the crisis coordinates, paranoid American forces take measures to harass and delay them.  The film is entertaining to watch on various levels.  The reverse-propaganda is amusing and rather ironic. If the scenario seems like a turnabout of the K-19 disaster, that's because it was probably based on that historical incident.  Except, the Americans are disorganized and belligerent whereas the Soviets are competent and compassionate.  And if you thought Harrison Ford's ""Russian"" accent was awful, wait 'til you hear this film's excruciating ""American"" accents and slang!  There is a subplot about a veteran refueler pilot who has been flying long enough to establish personal camaraderie with his USAF aviator counterparts.  Being the USSR's most experienced pilot, he is dispatched toward Grid 36-80, although the Soviet admiral is agonizingly aware that the fuel transfer will leave the tanker's own reserves too depleted to return.  The aircrew complies, nobly willing to sacrifice themselves to prevent a war.  The best scenes of the movie involve the tanker.  First, when American planes attempt to stop the refueling of the MiGs.  And later, when the crew braves a forced landing on a remote WWll-era airstrip.  Meanwhile, the Red rescuers' Zodiac approaches the doomed sub, only to be confronted by panicked, pistol-brandishing Yankee officers. Never fear, the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it is averted, and all our gallant heroes come home to their loyal, supportive spouses.  I recommend ""Sluchay v kvadrate 36-80"" as a Cold War curiosity.  Although it takes itself grimly-serious, it comes off to the Western viewer as practically parody.  Even the eccentric soundtrack detracts from the gravity of the plot.  I see that Amazon now offers a subtitled version.",1085184000,2,2469,5.408376963350785
