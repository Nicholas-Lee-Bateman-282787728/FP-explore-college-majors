7828840,5,6302637880,"I remember doing this when it first came out and I really enjoyed it and have always used it as a measuring rod for other exercise videos over the years.  It is rigorous enough to make you sweat and work, but it doesnt kill you or has erratic, unrealistic moves and routines, which I think is the issue with a lot of exercise videos that ultimately end up un-watched on someone's DVD shelf.

Here, the pace is manageable and the changes occur fluently and Jennie Garth quite patiently walks you through the exercises - explaining special moves and pointing out to areas of interest.  The video is divided quite logically into  a low impact/warm up section, a high impact/cardio section, a cool down section, concluding with mat exercises for buttocks, legs and the abdomen to help tighten and tone. The length is perfect (about an hour) and the video states that if you want to lose a jeans size you have to do this exercise five times a week, in addition to adjusting your diet obviously.  I always feel great afterwards, even though it does make you sweat, but since it doesnt wipe you out, it is effective. The length also works for most people I think because anything more than 45 minutes to one hour is unrealistic. No one has the time.

The key with exercising and losing weight, or even staying fit, is motivation. And there is nothing worse than making something so complicated and annoying that it takes away your motivation. I am always stunned when people buy these complicated videos with weird exercise routines and equipment and then stop doing them precisely because they are so complicated. Not so this one. It is a shame it hasn't been released on DVD yet because it is a really great exercise video.",1328400000,3,1718,4.634868421052632
7828841,5,6302637880,"This video was a favorite in my teen years and it remains my go to get in shape favorite.  It  has survived the interim years of fad diets and crazes  yet  nearly 20 years later, I'm in my 30's  and still return to what works.  Diet fads are exactly that, just short term fixes for a long term problem.  Although Jennie's video is aimed at the beginner, it is also the perfect maintenance routine for anyone who wants to get back in shape before its too late.  What this video isn't: an instant quick fix.  What it is: a realistic and health conscious plan for long term fitness inside and out.  If you are tired of the false claims, empty promises of the latest exercise videos, and are looking to change your lifestyle then this is the video for you.  No get skinny quick schemes, just a get healthy for life plan promised.",1284681600,,825,4.326797385620915
7828842,5,6302637880,"This is one of my favorite exercise videos ever. It gives me a safe effective aerobic workout. I especially enjoy it because its challenging enough to give me results but is in no way intimidating. Its not a pushover video in any way, but its not so tough , I dread doing it like some of the videos I own.

As another reviewer mentioned, it is from 1992, so there is nothing faddish or trendy about it. It is just an effective , low impact aerobic work out with solid toning segments for the butt, thighs and stomach. I also like Jennie's engaging , encouraging ,warm style. She seems to have a firm grasp of the subject and theres a talk from her at the end about the dangers of eating disorders. The video also has a through warm up and a short but decent cool down. It is really too bad its out of print. I was lucky enough to find my copy on sale about 4 years ago.",1106697600,3,869,4.1117647058823525
7828843,4,6302637880,"While this video doesn't try to throw in all the latest moves--and is more than ten years old--I found it very enjoyable. I always hate aerobic videos because they are so fast paced. They assume you either pick up dance moves without explanation or have been doing these moves for years. This video is perfect for someone who wants a basic, easy-to-follow, moderate workout. It has helped me stick with exercising and is definitely recommended for beginners!",1106438400,2,458,4.961038961038961
