7955381,4,B00005UQ6T,"I watched this years ago.  It's a classic in my family.  So funny and a little sad, but very entertaining.  ""You be a sparrow I'll be an eagle"" is a phrase we still laugh about.  Glad it's on DVD.  I sent these out as a remember when gift to my siblings.",1351987200,,254,3.9019607843137254
7955382,1,B00005UQ6T,FANS OF THE ORIGINAL UNCUT VERSION SHOULD PROBABLY IGNORE THIS RELEASE. This version of the film has been HEAVILY edited. The original version's gory fight scenes have been mercilessly edited. Maybe it was to make the movie more kid friendly or something. The original uncut version was worthy of 10 stars. Hopefully someone will release the uncut version one day.,1290902400,2,364,5.083333333333333
7955383,3,B00005UQ6T,"This will be one of the shortest & sweetest reviews I've ever given a martial arts flick. My copy of Chinese Gods arrived yesterday and upon cramming it into my dvd player as soon as I could through the wrapping I quickly drew the following conclusions: 1)I could be wrong, but this appears to be a movie cenetered around Chinese mythology, or mythological gods, 2)Be warned...the animation is sub-par, so if you're looking for anime you may want to pass this one up, and 3)This one's a keeper for the fact that it's the only film that features an animated Bruce Lee character.

And that's all Decatur Redd wrote,folks. An easy one to pass up if you're looking for anime, but a collector's item for die hard Bruce Lee fans who want to have the only animated Bruce Lee feature in their possessions.",1171497600,,797,4.573426573426573
7955384,1,B00005UQ6T,"*Exhales* Guess i'll start from the beginning:

Looking back, i really can't remember how old i was when my mother brought the VHS tape of The Chinese Gods home.  But upon viewing, i knew i had a cult classic that would stay in my heart and mind for years to come (I'm 26 now, and still remember lines from the movie).

It may not have all the flash and style of japanese animation during that time (you must consider that this film was probably made in the late 70s or early 80s), but at that point in my cartoon watching days, i had never seen a fully animated chinese feature for that matter.  I was still pretty young when i lost the tape in a move, so in my early 20s when my mother (once again) found a copy on dvd, i almost peed myself, but was saddened by what i saw of the first few minutes. That said, let's rip into it.

For starters, the translation to dvd seemed to slow the pace of the animation down, especially during the fight scenes which in some parts are actually blurred for a pseudo bullet time effect; seems even worse now.

Many scenes that i loved (and i just about committed the whole movie to memory) were cut in the process of VHS to DVD transfer.  I was sorely disappointed to see the intro was completely cut.  For instance, after the credit roll at the start of the movie (which was also cut), a narrator chimes in to speak of the events that are about to take place in the movie, followed by a young maiden and a red demon sitting amongst the clouds, the woman holding a mirror that shoots lightning, whilst the demon bangs with fervor upon a large drum, representing thunder.  Completely cut.  There are too many others to list, and it brings me to tears to think about it.

Don't get me wrong; in my heart, this movie will always be 10,000 stars.  It had the comedy of a classic Shaw brothers flick, kung fu combined with chinese mysticism, AND BRUCE LEE!!  How could it get any better than that?

But alas, if you're a 2nd time around viewer looking to re-capture some of your childhood and remember this film as fondly as i have, just keep it in mind, not on your shelf.  If you're a 1st timer or have kids, this may be a cartoon you can enjoy together without any bias from what it was before: a full length animated kung fu masterpiece. *sigh*",1153872000,,2281,4.272093023255814
7955385,3,B00005UQ6T,I too saw this movie on T.V. when I was a kid and I too loved that Bruce Lee is the hero. I find that things we loved as kids look different as adults. I still loved this movie even though the quality was clearly taken from a worn tape. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those old badly dubbed Kung-Fu movies.,1142726400,,318,3.984375
7955386,2,B00005UQ6T,"You don't see a lot of animated films coming out of Hong Kong.  You wouldn't want to, if Chinese Gods is any indication.  I sort of know what happened plot-wise, but I can't say much of this film made a lick of sense to me.  I don't want to speak too badly of the plot because I have no idea how much, if any, of what I saw here relates to Chinese mythology.  The box cover claims that this film is ""an animated recreation of a true story,"" but that's a pretty hard pill to swallow from where I sit.  The setting is somewhere in long-ago China, and a certain ruler, influenced by a demon who looks surprisingly like Daphne from Scooby Doo, is trying his best to typify the stereotypical tyrant, starving his people, killing those who even think of being disloyal, etc..  The gods take a gander at what is going on down on earth and send an old man who may or may not be some sort of god down to do something about the problem.  A bunch of the suffering people end up being taken up in a whirlwind and dropped in another region where peace reigns.  The armies of both empires end up going to war (if you can call it that), with more and more demons and gods being drawn into the conflict.  This sounds like fun, but it isn't.  For one thing, some of the first gods to come down pretty much drop like flies, many to a really silly little magical imp.  The good guys keep running away, the gods ponder some more, the bad ruler calls in reinforcements as the Four Kings of Evil, and the movie just keeps running; ninety minutes can be a very long time.
The weird thing about the fighting is the fact that all these gods and demons can turn themselves into absolutely inane creatures, anything from a mouse to a really messed up dragon.  At one point, the film takes on a Tweety and Sylvester quality.  By this point, I barely knew who was who, and I certainly no longer cared.  The ineffectual gods eventually have to call upon a pseudo-Bruce Lee to get the job done; he comes complete with far too many of Lee's animal-type sounds; this guy can't wash his hands without making silly noises.  Did I mention all the gods can fly and/or scoot around on air-propelled clouds?  The whole thing is just crazy, in my opinion, and the animation is far from impressive.
I can't even say who the target audience for this film is supposed to be.  The very basic animation and overall goofiness of the action would seem to appeal to kids, yet there are moments of cartoon violence exceeding that of what you might find in a children's cartoon.  I watched this film because it offered hints of martial arts action, and I was curious to see what martial arts animation would look like.  Answer: it doesn't look very good at all, especially when every fight scene is shown in slow motion and usually involves at least one silly-looking creature who invites ridicule rather than intimidation.  If I had to choose between watching Chinese Gods again and Chinese water torture, I might just take the latter option.",1066780800,5,2993,4.407272727272727
7955387,3,B00005UQ6T,"I saw this cartoon when I was a little kid.  I liked it then because I was a fan of Bruce Lee and a fan of cartoons.  It's the only cartoon I know of with Bruce Lee in it (not his real voice).  The quality is like a worn out tape, but at least it won't get worse.",1023926400,2,263,3.5
