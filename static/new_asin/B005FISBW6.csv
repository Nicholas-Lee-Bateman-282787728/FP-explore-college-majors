8470036,5,B005FISBW6,great series! a shame that it ended so soon. it is a great cop show with fantastic characters and the 2 female leads did a great job!,1512518400,,133,3.962962962962963
8470037,5,B005FISBW6,"Rachel Carpani (Abby Kowalski) did a perfect job losing her Aussie accent to play in this weekly series.

In a family of officers, father and three brothers, she goes into the field becoming a police detective who recently joined the Internal Affairs division of the Chicago Police Department.  It poses a problem with her brothers and family yet she finds ways to man up, always attempting to keep the peace with the family.

Abby's partner in the Internal Affairs Division was Marisa Ramirez as Lina Flores, another Chicago police detective. She's pregnant most of the series but a great help.

The show was on Lifetime Television and I'm not sure why it was canceled.  It may have been too up-to-date for television i.e. Abby's low-rise pants and semi-casual sex.",1351900800,,766,4.906976744186046
8470038,5,B005FISBW6,I heartily agree with the previous reviewer - this was a very good series. I can't understand why it was canceled. I certainly hope they put it on dvd soon for those of us who enjoyed the program to purchase and enjoy watching again and again.,1347926400,2,243,4.304347826086956
8470039,5,B005FISBW6,"The series follows Abby Kowalski, who was a Chicago Police Officer, who in order to pursue her dream career as a detective takes the only opening available in the Internal Affairs Division. Her decision to join the department's internal affairs division puts her at odds with members of her own family, who themselves are Police Officers. Abby must find a way to do her job as an IAD detective and deal with her family of cops.

I have not been so excited about a cable series in a long time, and on the life time channel no less. This was a breath of fresh air show having to do with cops. Abby's life is quite interesting with IA and has a dad and three brothers who are cops to deal with. The episodes from one right to the last of the season is addictive. Already within the second episode, there is a conflicting case having to deal with IA and one of Abby's brothers. A very good show that is not only for men but women as well that deals with family, relationships, work and so much more. I watch the first 6 episodes in one day and the rest the next. I am eagerly waiting on season two.

Great show lifetime, I was not expecting it. I love lifetime for their movies not series, and this was a good one.
