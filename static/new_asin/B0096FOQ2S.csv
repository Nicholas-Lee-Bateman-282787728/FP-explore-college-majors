8536699,5,B0096FOQ2S,"Very off-beat and odd, but also sincere, moving and thought provoking. The kind of film you see at a festival not knowing much about, just a that a couple of friends suggest you see it. and walk out feeling you saw something that had real value.

Tom Dunne, in a nuanced and effecting, subtle performance plays a man named Eli walking his way across the California desert to the Pacific ocean in Los Angeles. He's looking for meaning, and finds fragments of it in the various characters he meets along the way.

I liked the way the film created quirky characters while avoiding making fun of them, or turning them into stereotypes we've seen before.

The film manages to raise the big questions about life without seeming like a sophomore term paper. And it's beautifully shot (Akin was a photographer before he was a film-maker).

The two main characters Eli meets are women  terrific work by singer songwriter Maria McKee and Tessa Ferrer  both of whom are as lost as he is in their own way. (McKee also contributes to the films very effective score) The three intersect and touch each others lives. There's also a surreal dream character called ""The Answer Man"" who shows up occasionally in Eli's mind to torment him with the pointlessness of his quest for answers. This is far less pretentious than it sounds, handled as equally haunting and darkly funny.

A poetic film that I found myself loving, it's possible my lack of expectations lead to my strong positive reaction. But I don't think so. The film haunted me for days, and that's always a good sign.",1409270400,,1560,4.6923076923076925
8536700,5,B0096FOQ2S,"This Film is an impressive debut from Director Jim Akin. A surreal meditation on identity, this film has many impressive set pieces set in the dark corners of Los Angeles. The film at times reflects the low budget, but Akin more than makes up with interesting imagery and coaxes fine performances from Tom Dunne , Tessa Ferrer, Rob Zabrecky ( as the answer Man, is he the Devil?) and a young man named Dean Ogle, who is very good.

Akin is the husband of singer Maria McKee , who co-produced, and appears in the film, She gives a fine performance herself, and and co-wrote the score.

Akin and McKee are producing a second film, which promises some new music from Maria, which will be welcome",1396915200,4,692,4.528
8536701,5,B0096FOQ2S,"This is by far one of the best movies I ever watched. It turned me away from Hollywood productions for good and I was happy to discover that we still have such beauty in us to create such movies. Great work, words cannot say why or how, you will need to watch it to understand.",1396224000,2,277,4.054545454545455
8536702,5,B0096FOQ2S,"Very well done small story of a man in search of bigger things, and encountering a world of diverse, interesting people and places.  Great music gives the ride a joyful tone.",1394150400,2,174,4.612903225806452
8536703,5,B0096FOQ2S,"An existential, archetypal, journey, a spiriutal quest, as a man takes on
his fathers fallen dream, dropped in death, and picked up by a son who
hardly knew him, who walks from the desert to the sea, with Los Angeles
as the limnal land between. Asking all the basic questions, looking for meaning
as much as answers. On the way Jim Akin introduces an ensemble of LA characters
asking their own questions and the dark trickster ""Answer Man"" who has all
the answers.

A surreal, absurdist, narrative with hardboiled voiceovers, poetry, musical
sections as well as music video type montages. Visually Jim Akin has found
a timelessly mythic retro Americana city, just off and under the freeways,
across the tracks,down the dry cement river,along the flood control culverts,
a sun dust bleached, barbed wire crowned, chain-linked melted black cracked asphalt industrial patina painted limbo of a Lost Angeles that can only be
seen on foot.

Just when you think they don't make films like this any more Jim Akin puts
the Art back in Autuer!",1376179200,6,1034,4.902857142857143
