2601183,5,B000G6BL42,One of the shows I have seen. Great to see actors from different shows show their abilities in different areas. Just great.,1167782400,3,123,4.636363636363637
2601184,5,B000G6BL42,"What more could you ask for? Considering it's not a secret that HBO charges an arm and a leg for their season DVDs, this set is truly worth the money. Thanks to netflix I rented season 1 of this and just kept going episode after episode. Never have I been so into a television show like I was with this. The writing is incredible to say the least, back stories are explained with extreme detail, continuation is nothing less than amazing, casting is great(especially the special guest stars i.e. Jon Seda, LL Cool J, Luke Perry, etc...) This show brought out the best in a lot of actors you had no idea were capable of such drama. Everything about this show is entertaining, hard hitting, emotional, shocking, and just fun. I've said this 100 times and I'll say it again, OZ is truly the best show that television had. It's a shame it had to end but these DVDs will prove how important and incredible this show was and it's potential. Only season that is somewhat sub par is 3. Couldve finished better. Where as the season finale had a lot of unexplained questions as well, the special features includes the finale uncut with an extra 45 minutes! Basically a movie.",1159315200,14,1165,4.5260663507109005

2601199,1,B000G6BL42,"When Oz debuted in 1997, I tried to watch but despite the critical acclaim this HBO series received, I could not stomach the program.
Recently, I was given seasons 2-6 on DVD. I decided that I would give Oz a second look, and ordered season 1 from Amazon.
After wasting two weeks trying to be objective, after viewing all six seasons I found the totality of the series to be devoid of true artistic merit. The rampant graphic nudity and sexuality were disgusting. I fail to see what furthering of plot is served by the depiction of various items of human anatomy and violations of same in this series.
I cannot recommend this series.",1475539200,,633,4.56140350877193

I didn't give it five stars because all of the seasons are packaged differently.  some seasons come in one large DVD case with each DVD inside on pages like a book.  Other seasons have separate DVD cases for each disc.

A mentally challenged prisoner, the brother of another inmate, housed in the maximum security facility rather than a facility for the mentally challenged?  Only one doctor in the entire prison that seems to work 24 hours a day?  A Corrections Officer that had is Achilles's Tendon sliced, hobbling around with a cane still guarding prisoners?

2601254,4,B000G6BL42,"""Oz"" was the first ""serious"" HBO drama, predating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B006CR2OOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>&nbsp;by a year. It had many of the same elements - multiple story lines, compelling and clearly drawn characters, and brutal, unrelenting violence. The setting - an experimental unit within a prison - gave the writers great latitude in setting up the various situations and interactions.

Knowing several people who have been incarcerated, and having worked briefly in the R. J. Donovan Correctional Facility, and the federal Otay Detention Facility, I am not ignorant of what goes on within those walls. While some would say that the presentation of prison life in ""Oz"" was realistic, I would respond that it went beyond realism to gratuity in its clearly gleeful depiction of sadistic violence. I heard an interview with creator Tom Fontana, where he admitted that he and the writers competed to subject the characters to the most brutal and humiliating degradations imaginable. Nothing was off limits, and it showed - ""Oz"" quickly progressed from intensity to unbelievability. That's not to say that many of the events in the series have not actually happened to someone in real life - I'm sure that they have - but the center of those scenes was not the act of finding the inherent horror in violence, but approaching it from the other direction - starting with the horror and building a story around it. In this way it was like pornography, where the sex act is the entire point, and the story is only an excuse to set it up - the opposite of drama, where the story is at the center, that sometimes leads to dangerous and unexpected places.

That's not to say that ""Oz"" didn't have sympathetic and engaging characters. Beecher, the attorney ""made an example of"" for his drunk-driving manslaughter of a little girl, is the terrified law-abiding citizen thrust in with vicious thugs. The wheelchair-bound Hill is the narrator, invisible and therefore able to observe all. Schillinger, a brutal white supremacist, is continually peeved by everyone's repeated mispronunciation of his name. O'Reily, the merciless hoodlum who cares for his mentally disabled brother. Idzik, who is bent on assassinating the man who with a casual, offhand comment, inadvertently shattered his entire worldview and plunged him into despair. The continually-bewildered Busmalis, who cannot seem to understand that his repeated efforts to escape are only prolonging his sentence. Different groups vie for power, individual characters build and break trust in an endless struggle for survival.

* * SPOILER ALERT * *

The ending, in which everyone is rounded up into buses and removed from the premises to avoid death by poison gas, is both symbolic (everyone finally ""escapes""), and at the same time, they are all going to be ""new fish"" again, in an unknown prison with its own unpredictable and uncontrollable environment. As the bus leaves, everyone is quiet, and frightened again, as they must have been on their first day in Oz, so long ago.

It may be unfair to fault ""Oz"" for not being ""The Sopranos"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B00GC6AF7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>, as there hadn't really been anything like it before. It proved that people would pay for premium cable in order to watch a strongly written, character-driven drama - so it paved the way for what followed, which turned out to be the ""golden age of cable television"" of the 2000s, when for a few years, the best drama wasn't on stage or in the movie theaters, as it had been until then, but on that much-maligned, lowbrow, and small-screened medium.",1403308800,,3783,5.372681281618887

2601282,5,B000G6BL42,"Oz gets overshadowed a lot by other HBO hits, such as The Sopranos, Deadwood, and The Wire (which was overshadowed by The Sopranos).  However, Oz is actually the show that started it all.  Without it, you wouldn't have your Tony Soprano or Al Swearengen.  Oz was kind of like a experimental project, where the creators had the unusual power to do *anything* they wanted.  HBO hardly gave them any kind of boundaries and so they pushed the envelope further than any show in the past.  The result?  A completely revolutionary, gritty drama that isn't perfect or necessarily as good as the above shows, but is skipped in conversation way too often when talking about the HBO greats.

Obviously, don't watch if you are sensitive to blood, rape and violence.  It is heavily piled on and continuously gets worse throughout the seasons.  However, it's a lot more than just that.  The quality of storylines and dialogue are often a little ahead of its time and there are a lot of genius twists and turns.  It also has the advantage of taking place in where new characters can be introduced as often as they want.  You'd be surprised though how much they continue to rely on core characters throughout the years though, which is the sign of a strong show.

One of the most interesting things about this show, is that if you are a TV BUFF you will be thrilled to recognize so many faces.  This is where Edie Falco (Carmela from The Sopranos) got her real start, and they actually let her leave for the bigger role on the Sopranos.  She plays hardened correctional officer Diane, who has had a pretty rough life. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Simon Adebisi, an incredibly huge and scary inmate, and the actor later became quite famous in his portrayal as Mr. Eko in Lost.  Lauren Velez, known well for her role in Dexter as LaGuerta plays Dr. Gloria Nathan.  Christopher Meloni, most known for his lead role in Law & Order: SVU and brief appearance last season in True Blood enters in the second season as Chris Keller.  J.K. Simmons, known for lots of roles, most notably as Dr. Skoda in Law & Order plays Nazi Vern Schillinger.  B.D. Wong, the psychiatrist in Law & Order: SVU plays a priest.  Kirk Acevedo, who played Charlie Francis in Fringe, plays inmate Miguel Alvarez.  Harold Perrineau Jr., who became quite famous for his role as Michael in Lost, plays narrator and inmate Augustus Hill.  Dean Winters, the ""Beeper King"" from 30 Rock or the ""Mayhem"" guy from the Allstate commercials plays inmate Ryan O'Reily.  Mark Margolis, a critically acclaimed actor and most recently for his role as Hector Salamanca is an inmate for awhile. There are also a lot of interesting guest appearances like LL Cool J, real-life retired NBA player Rick Fox playing a convicted professional athlete, one episode has the guy that plays Alby Grant in Big Love, and Luke Perry and Bobby Cannavale in the later seasons.

The show starts to go downhill a little in the fourth season.  I don't want to spoil much, but you may notice the decline in quality as well.  However, overall this is a brilliant show with a hugely talented and creative group of writers and actors.",1370563200,3,3148,4.688524590163935
2601283,5,B000G6BL42,"If only HBO and the rest of American television could produce more shows like this one regularly. The closest they've come  was Queer as Folk on SHO.

2601297,5,B000G6BL42,"Gritty and intense, this dark prison drama follows the incarceration of Tobias Beecher, an ivy league lawyer with a drinking problem.  Beecher, (played by Lee Tergensen) convicted for the murder of a little girl as a result of his drunk driving, experiences the full range of life in a maximum security prison, from rape and murder, to earning special privileges and homosexual love.  A supporting cast of characters played by ""familiar faces"", help pull the meta plot along while developing their own sub plots and growing as characters.  Beecher's own transformation while inside OZ is a reflection of all of us, (well mostly, I supposed hardened career criminals don't count) our ability to adapt to the most horrific circumstances, and the changes we go through to harden our souls.

I loved this series! While I thought the ending left to many ""strings undone"" for my taste, it was indicative of life for the inmates continuing on, even as our perspective ""the cameras"" leave.  While the two shows are not related, other than an actor or two that appears in both, Oz is a great follow up to The Wire.",1365379200,2,1105,4.825396825396825

2601306,5,B000G6BL42,"""Oz"" is an American television drama series created by Tom Fontana, who also wrote or co-wrote all of the series' 56 episodes. It was the first one-hour dramatic television series to be produced by premium cable network HBO. ""Oz"" premiered on July 12, 1997 and ran for six seasons. The series finale aired February 23, 2003. The show was filmed in New York City, New York and later Bayonne, New Jersey.

""Oz"" is the nickname for the Oswald State Correctional Facility, formerly Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictional maximum-security prison (level 4). The nickname is a reference to the classic film ""The Wizard of Oz"", which is notable for popularizing the phrase: ""There's no place like home""; in contrast, the series has used the tagline: ""It's no place like home"".

In 2008, the show was placed at #73 on Entertainment Weekly's ""New TV Classics"" list.

The majority of Oz's plot arcs are set in ""Emerald City,"" also a concept from The Wizard of Oz. In this experimental unit of the prison, unit manager Tim McManus emphasizes rehabilitation and learning responsibility during incarceration, rather than carrying out purely punitive measures. Emerald City is an extremely controlled environment, with a carefully managed number of members of each racial and social group, with the hope of easing tensions among these various groups.

Under McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, all inmates in Em City struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power - either over the drug trade or over other inmate factions and individuals. Others, corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive, some long enough to make parole and others even just to see the next day. The show offers a no-holds-barred account of prison life. All plots, subplots and conflicts are given context and explanation by the show's wheelchair-using narrator, Augustus Hill.
""Oz"" is primarily narrated by inmate Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau, Jr.), former drug dealer, convicted murderer and former drug addict. Now paralyzed from the waist down and wheelchair-bound, he appears in surreal segments and introductions that usually relate to each episode's overall theme. He also sets up scenes, introduces characters and adds epilogues. When necessary -- usually when a character is introduced -- Hill appears as an omniscient narrator. Used as a literary device of the writers, he narrates details of characters' crimes, their inmate identification numbers and their sentences. Perineau performs from within a glass cube always in his wheel chair. He is a wise man because he delivers his monologues in character. He's human and like everyone else (with one exception) he is guilty of his crime.

The cast is nothing short of remarkable- at this point you will recpognize star after star, from classic Rita Moreno and B.D. Wong to Harold Perineau and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, both of whom became network famous on ABC's infamous ""LOST."" The show is plot driven and we are left out of elements if we miss an episode, though we'll catch up. But the character development that occurs with absolutely every actor is something that is rarely seen on television.

There are some graphic, violent scenes involving the manipulation, degradation and even murder of inmates. As we watch this series and become more and more enthralled, we have the feeling that this may well be what it's like inside a maximum security prison. Typical of cable produced television each episode is a full hour in length and each season consists of only eight episodes (for some reason, season four produced twice that amount) but there was never a moment when the viewer feels cheated in comparison to the 24 episode network season. When one compares this show, created by Tom Fontanna, to the formulaic works of Dick Wolf (CSI and it's extended family to include NCIS) one is tempted to laugh. CSI begins, always, with a death ort discovery of a body and then a comercial break. We come back and the investigation begins. The facilities in these police headquarters are futuristic and without the sets, the hackneyed scripts and shallow characters are obvious. The set for ""Oz"" is remarkable and largely produced on location. The Emerald City is a brilliantly designed experimental ward of the prison in which the inmates feel lucky to be housed. We are taken out to ""gen. pop"" (General Population"" from time to time  and realism is such that the viewer feels less protected in Gen Pop than in Em City.

Despite this, the characters are all human. There are bad guards, evil politicians; there are prisoners for whom you feel deeply sorry (we begin episode one by following the character played by Lee Tergessen, an innocent and frightened white collar business man who made the mistake of driving home drunk one evening and killing a you ng girl. He more than pays the price for this and, in fact, by the end of the first episode- his first two days, yuou feel as though he's been wrpongly placed. At the same time we meet characters who are simply evil and then, as time passes we begin to see they are capable of love and compassion. There are characters for whom we feel nothing but hatred and it doesn't change, even as the most horrific of things happen to them.

This is s show you should purchase in one fell sweep. I bought it season by season nine years ago and paid per season what Amazon is asking now for the entire series. You'll watch the entire series; you may well watch it straight through the way many of us did with ""LOST"". You will be moved every episode and though this is without question one of the finest ensembles shows in television history, the glory belongs to Tom Fontanna and HB O, who was brave enough to make history with this.

If you are squeamish; if you are offended by male frontal nudity, if you aren't strong enough to witness rape, blood, beatings or emotional abuse then be prepared. Many of the weaker reviews this show has garnered have been a result of critics who are uncomfortable with intense tension (It leaves the gang fights of ""West Side Story""- speaking of Rita Moreno - far behind) and the violence- there are some triggering rape scenes - and those critics who can't objectively watch a romance between two men or a group of men doing heroin. Fontanna doesn't lie to us.

The show has been shown in a number of foreign countries on open air network without editing- so it sincerely isn't as bad as what most of you pay $14 to see at the local Cineplex. But in the context of television, I can see how people are surprised.

2601332,5,B000G6BL42,"I absolutely LOVE this show! This show is gritty, edgy, & serious as a heart attack. Oz explores the life of characters inside a seriously hard-core prison--that's PRISON, not some County lock-up--characters ranging from the nun, brilliantly played by Rita Moreno, to guards, administrators, and, of course, prisoners. The tremendous ensemble cast includes: Ernie Hudson, Harold Perrineau (recently of LOST & The Unusuals), J.K. Simmons (currently of The Closer), Dean Winters, Eamonn Walker, B.D. Wong, Kirk Acevedo (most recently of Fringe), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (also of LOST), Luis Guzman, Luke Perry (yes, of 90210 fame), & Edie Falco (formerly of The Sopranos & currently of Nurse Jackie).

If your favorite shows are epitomized by such network fare as Prison Break, House, & 24, then this show might not be for you; however, if you also or mostly enjoy serious drama found on Premium cable networks (i.e. HBO, SHO, or Starz), shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Spartacus, True Blood, The Tudors, or Rome, then you will definitely enjoy Oz! Oz is a no-holds-barred look at life in a hard core prison. Not your ordinary prison, mind you, but a prison that is opening an experimental housing unit where every cell on the block is made completely of clear plexi walls & no part of prison life is secret. The prison is Oswald Penitentiary, or Oz, & the experimental unit is called Emerald City. Some of the hardest inmates inhabit Emerald City: the neo-Nazi played by JK Simmons, the Nation of Islam Imam played by Eamonn Walker, & the intelligent (omniscient narrator) in a wheel chair played by Harold Perrineau. Each character brings something to the show, some already hard & others made hard by their time inside Emerald City (i.e. the lawyer who's made and example of played by Lee Tergesen.

As you would expect from a hard-core prison, there is violence, nudity (mostly male nudity as it is largely about male inmates in a glass prison), & what some would likely consider mild porn (though it certainly isn't porn as there is no real sexual acts being performed on camera). This certainly isn't gay porn, as many of the sex acts depicted are acts of male-on-male rape, but there are those relationships where an inmate ""chooses"" to become a willing sexual partner (or a ""bitch"") to receive protection from an inmate in a position of power. Basically, this show is an unadulterated look at life inside a prison, which includes the kinds of violence that one would expect the kinds of inmates housed here to commit. If this bothers you, don't waste your money. However, if you're secure in your sexuality or are unafraid to confront the sex & violence depicted by this show, then don't turn away from this incredible look at the dark side of humanity, wondering if something like this could be our future should society every break down for whatever reason. It's definitely a worthwhile philosophical exercise for the intellect, challenging one to identify literary archetypes & find meaning within the stories, lessons that teach us about the parts of the human psyche civilized people should be seriously afraid to explore within themselves.",1280102400,12,3155,4.984819734345351

Oz is a closed-doors  life with prosonners in Oaswald penitentiary center, level four.

The final scene is little bit disappointing because we want to know what will happen to some characters  and , unfortunately we felt there was something missing.
Everything in Oz is in evolution , even the guards and the warden. We never know who will survive.

Once I started watching these CD's I was captivated. The realism is as I have heard from those that have worked in the prison system. I was shocked. Although fiction, it showed more reality then one ever would expect. Fear, regret, intimidation, betrayal,  murder, lust. No wonder our prison system is built with revolving doors.

The performance of each actor was so convincing that I actually had to say to myself this is only a movie for TV. Every XXX rated event that happens in prison happened in ""OZ"".

I started watching it within a couple of days and I could not get enough.  This show is so well acted and it has such intriguing stories that you don't want to stop watching.

There are a few things about the show that are hard to watch, but with it being a show about a prison, that should not be a surprise.  You become invested in these characters and your moral compass is tested.  The people you think are good end up doing the wrong thing and the people you think are bad end up doing the right thing.  So, it makes you feel differently towards inmates.  It shows the human side of these men and makes them less scary.  I think most people believe that inmates are terrible people, but that's not always the case and OZ does a great job of showing that.

It also shows corruption in the penal system.  You see the men and women who work there get changed by what happens.  For this series being almost 10 years old, it is still a show that can resonate with today's problems.  I highly recommend this show to anyone with an open mind.

The acting is superb, and because there is no attempt to do anything that would mask the heinous brutality and stomach-churning things that happen in the prison environment, it can be overwhelming. One always wonders why these things are definitely allowed to occur within the penal system. Not just a blind eye, but a complete refusal to recognize that only the strong, visious and sadistic will survive. The portrayal of the Catholic priest is probably on target, but I seriously doubt that a man with a true Christian conscience would have any part of this hell-on-earth and do nothing but say ""profound things about horrible events.""

I highly recommend Oz; the stories are interesting, the characters are interesting and multi-layered and the writers really gave the main characters fascinating issues to grapple with and allowed them to grow and change over the course of the series.  As a complete aside, it is really funny to watch Oz and then watch the various Law & Order shows and see who went from Oz to Law & Order.  An amazing number of Oz stars are or were regulars on one or more Law & Order series.",1255392000,,543,4.242718446601942

2601363,4,B000G6BL42,"This show is one of the first HBO shows that became famous, though The Sopranos took it over and surpassed it.  Oz always struggled on HBO and was always in danger of being canceled but this was a time when HBO was known to nurture their shows and not cast them off like dirt.  Oz is the name of Ozwald Correctional Facility in an unnamed but probably Northeastern state.  It is supposed to be a model prison that aims to rehabilitate maximum security offenders.  Unfortunately, extraordinary violence and murder takes place there with frequency.  Would be hard to explain in the real world what is going on in this prison but this is a fantasy.  Much of the fantasy now seems to have been heavily borrowed for Lost as are many of the actors from this show.  The seasons are uneven but many are good and none are bad.  A good show to watch from beginning to end.  Enjoy and don't forget about the male full frontal nudity, cover your eyes if you need to.",1250208000,,954,4.405714285714286

This series was actually purchased as a present for my boyfriend, but I enjoyed watching it just as much as he did. Great story lines, interesting characters. The extras on the DVD's are fun, especially the commentaries. Good value and a terrific price!",1244678400,,440,4.653846153846154
2601376,4,B000G6BL42,"One of my big hang-ups with TV shows making the move to DVD is that, unlike most movies, the extra content for DVD TV shows is sorely lacking.  Such is the case with HBO to DVD.

If you liked Oz on HBO then you'll enjoy it on DVD.  The only qualm I have is that the extra content on these DVDs are lackluster.  The commentary (which I usually love) often seemed to lull and I found myself listening to the actual show rather than the commentary. While doing the commentary the speakers often repeated the same conversation numerous times during the same episode (the same topic in several different episodes) and there is only so much patting of yourself on the back that I can stand. (I liked Oz, obviously, I bought six seasons on DVD, but I was quickly sick to death of hearing how everyone who worked on the show thinks they worked on the ""edgiest, most out there, most balls to the wall, best show on television"" because they said it every two seconds on the commentary)  Also, for as much behind the scenes features as you can find on YouTube, you would expect that there would be at least one behind the scenes featurette on the DVD.  While the extended and deleted scenes were... interesting, they were not, for the most part, worth the time it took to pick them up off of the cutting room floor.  Frequently, on the Oz commentary, the actors and creator referred to the fact that the set of was full of laughter and fun.  Why then was none of this brought to the DVD?  Perhaps that would be something fun that fans of the show would like to see.

As I said; if you enjoyed the series on TV then you'll enjoy re-watching the series again (or if you just like watching dudes get naked and fight you'll enjoy this series) but if you're interested in a behind the scenes look at the ""best show on TV""  then prepare to be disappointed.",1242086400,4,1839,4.347953216374269
2601377,5,B000G6BL42,"""Oz"" is unlike anything that has ever been on TV before. We will also never see anything like it on broadcast televison again. A raw explicit series, ""Oz"" shows the viewer what men go through while being incarcerated in the Oswald State Prison in the northeast. The inmates go into Oz as a certain person, but they came out scarred for life, that is if they survive their time there. The series tells many stories simultaneously, and it is told in the form of a continuing serial as many stories are told over subsequent episodes. There is infighting, backstabbing, murder, drug use, homosexual sex, and pure hatred in the walls of Oz, and as a viewer it makes one happy that we are on the other side of that prison wall looking in: Oz is a place of hell that no one wants to enter.
 The series has gone down in history as being the one with the most graphic depictions of prison life ever filmed, and ""Oz"" became one of HBO's biggest hits during its original run. It ran six seasons, but those seasons were short as only eight shows were filmed each year, although one season had 16 shows filmed, as HBO ordered more episodes since their other hit ""The Sapranos"" was on an extended hiatus.
 The longest lasting story on ""Oz"" is the gay love story between Tobias and Chris, and it lasts from season 2 until the final episode that aired in 2003. The series dramatizes how these two straight men came together and the obstacles that they encountered while living in a place that was not only human, but adamant about anyone loving one another, be it straight or gay.
 Oscar winner Rita Moreno plays Sister Pete who is really the only moral person in Oz. Ernie Hudson plays the prison warden, one of the most dense characters I have ever seen as he was largely responsible for a lot of the problems at Oz. Christopher Meloni became a star as Chris Keller before he went to ""Law and Order"", and he portrays Chris as a complex man who ultimately destroys himself in the end.
 ""Oz"" is not for people under 18 and for those who have a weakness for graphic gratuitous television. When I say this is the most violent tv series ever made I mean it. The murders, the rapes of men, and the language may be hard to digest, but the producers wanted to be as faithful as possible in televising what a prison is actually like. The sex scenes may be hard to watch if your a straight man, but if your homosexual you will be left breathless as nothing like this has ever been seen before on televison: there is a lot of male kissing, simulated anal penetration, and there is a lot of frontal nudity.
 ""Oz"" is one of the best series to ever come down the pike. Sit back and get lost in the world of Oz. You will not be the same after watching.",1241913600,2,2723,4.3629191321499015
2601378,5,B000G6BL42,"Oz has been regarded as one of HBO's more promising dramas, and it is so without a doubt. I won't touch on the qualities of the drama, because you will probably already heard the numerous accolades this show has received. I will, however, touch on the other aspects.

Gritty as the show claims to be, I personally find the whole prison to be the polar opposite of drab. The prison is well-lit, which certainly (to me) detracts away from the experience of a ""dark"" prison drama. However, the drama itself is nevertheless outstanding. Stick with it, even if you find it uninteresting the first few episodes. It's worth it.

The extras, too, have nothing that distances this dvd package from the crowd.

However, considering the top-notch drama and the unavailibility of a 4.5 star rating, this show is GOOD. For those who have never watched this show before, get the dvd. For those who have, get it, for until the blu-ray version comes out, there's probably no other way you can relive your experiences in Oz.",1241136000,2,1007,4.7102272727272725
2601379,5,B000G6BL42,"I have never seen a show that is as well written, well acted, mindblowing, shocking and amazing as Oz. The main reason, I think,that the show was so successfull was because of the fact that the creator of the show, Tom Fontana, wrote every single episode. Sure, there were some co writers, but Tom really was behind all of the stories. the first 2 seasons were just THE CEILING! they just couldn't have gotten any better! the rest of the seasons were REALLY good and the last season was a little shakey, so it was a good thing they ended it when they did. plus, the old characters started to die and new characters were replaced, which were good, but not as good as the original cast.
but all and all, the show gets a five star rating from me! Finally, a soap operah for GUYS!!!",1240272000,,778,4.335616438356165
2601380,4,B000G6BL42,"I purchased the whole set and although scenes are sometimes lengthy and boring the series does get the message across that prison is not the place to be.  Surprising display of violence, nudity and male emotion dominates much of the story.  If you are looking for a man-to-man video I would recommend this purchase.  If you are looking for scenes of violence and blood like you find in the Hostel and Saw movies this one is not quite up to that level.",1238716800,4,451,4.475609756097561

Oh, and one little complaint. For the hard of hearing, there aren't subtitles in the first 2 (or maybe it's just the first) seasons. If your TV has its own subtitles, then you can use those. I'm not deaf, but I like to catch every little detail so subtitles are important to me.

Someone commented on the menus being slow. That's how it is! It's a HBO release, and the budget never pretended to be huge. If that's a reason to not buy it, then you're missing out!

More than 48 hours of well scripted, well acted, slightly twisted drama for just over $100! This is a great investment, but you have to be a fan! Of course you're gonna be dissapointed if you don't even like the series and then buy the whole box set! I don't see why anyone would invest in a series set like this, only to write a review that says something to the effect of, 'I didn't like the first series, but thought I'd buy this box set anyway... It sucks! Don't buy it! The menus are slow, and the credits go for too long...'

2601401,5,B000G6BL42,"About the show:

Wow. From the first episode you feel as if you are hooked in, although I don't want to dive too much into the show itself (just skim it) you find that this show, apart from its hard hitting grit and honesty (maybe it is? I don't know, ive never been to prison) dealing with drugs, ethnic grouping, racist attacks, homosexuality, violence and spiritual guidance, this show has something for everyone to walk away with and contemplate as it does dictate a lot of what our soceity is like, even if we have to look at a test subject that is criminal and locked up.

Few warnings though:

Not for the faint hearted: If you are conservative in nature, I would not suggest watching this show, as some of what happens is REALLY harsh (especially as seasons go on)

Not for children: I personally don't believe that people who are under the age of 17 should be watching this show, as it contains graphic sexual scenes and nudity.

Dont watch this if you are a devote prison break fan: This show just makes it look like a joke! Although only the first season of the show was in prison, the realism (if they even tried for that) just doesnt compare to how hard up prisoners really have it, which i feel OZ may convey much better. Tea bag? More like hand bag! Compared to characters like Shillinger and Ada Beisi he is TAME.

On the continual arguments with pricing and dvd quality:

Despite claims in these previous reviews, I have yet to find a problem with this six season set.

Although, I have to admit, the menu's are seemingly primative and quite long in loading up (panning through computer graphics etc which gets annoying) but the quality is still great.

I also don't see how this boxset is seen as expensive. At the time fo this review (28/7/07) the entire show in this offer costs $208, If you look to buy all seasons seperatly, it will cost you an extra $8 dollars, which you could just spend on getting a better delivery service.

When I bought this show (about 4 months ago) I payed about $170. So at this point in time I do find it a bit pricey and would suggest watching it since prices go up and down. I personally feel though even at 208 USD, its still worth it.",1182902400,47,2187,4.391089108910891
