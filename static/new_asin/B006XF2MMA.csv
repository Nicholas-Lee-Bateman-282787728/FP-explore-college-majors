8506255,5,B006XF2MMA,Family has enjoyed in the comfort of our home!,1435190400,,46,4.222222222222222
8506256,5,B006XF2MMA,"I going to have to be honest...
THIS is a great place to start your IMAX Collection.
There is a TEN disc set; there're TWO, and THREE disc sets.
THIS one has four of the best in the series. As is the norm,
these are---because of the size of the movie REELS in the
theaters[and expense]----all under 40-minutes... in this case,
""short and sweet, times four!""

Must-have Blu-rays!

8506257,5,B006XF2MMA,"Fantastic imaging, great sound, and kudos to Imax for their presentations.  Thanks Science Museum of Minnesota.  Education of our Earth is never ending... we can all learn from these special interest films.  I think they should be required viewing, with questions afterwards, for all members of Congress.",1394150400,,304,5.425531914893617
8506258,5,B006XF2MMA,Theses are some great movies which I would recommend for everyone. I wish there where more like this out there and at this great price.,1393113600,,135,4.44
8506259,5,B006XF2MMA,"BEING IMAX, THESE ARE OF COURSE GORGEOUS FILMS, BUT ALWAYS TOO SHORT !  CAN'T GO TOO FAR WRONG WITH ANY OF THE IMAX COLLECTIONS.",1393027200,,128,4.333333333333333
8506260,1,B006XF2MMA,We were looking for great photos to watch on our new Blu-ray.  Turned out to be more of a documentary about how people got the pictures.  Situations were staged and the scientist were poor actors.,1391385600,,196,4.571428571428571
8506261,5,B006XF2MMA,"I've watched a few of these on netflix on my hdtv but the quality of the image was almost unbearable considering how great imax productions usually are. Getting them on bluray made a night and day difference. The image is beautifully sharp and clear and for a visual experience like these films are meant to be, it's absolutely necessary. I got the four on sale and it was a great buy. Their may be more recent documentaries like planet earth that were filmed entirely in HD but for the price, I'm very happy with this set.",1390694400,,523,4.458333333333333
8506262,5,B006XF2MMA,"Great picture quality and a good documentary collection . The narrator for the Rainforest was a bit boring and hard to understand, as for the rest of the series , I think the film makers were pioneers and before their time . Imax cameras are big and bulky and to film in all different and dangerous locations , its amazing .
This collection is a good learning adventure for all children at school , its interesting and not a drawn out documentary collection.",1389744000,,458,4.530120481927711
8506263,5,B006XF2MMA,"There are many excellent IMAX blu-rays available on this site, but these titles: Ring of Fire, Tropical Rain Forest, The Greatest Places and Sharks are a good place to start your collection. Highly recommended.",1362182400,3,210,5.205882352941177
