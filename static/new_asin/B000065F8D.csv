3535339,1,B000065F8D,"Review for the product not the film:
Metropolis is one of the most influential anime films to come out.  Its an excellent adaptation of Fritz Lang's masterpiece and carries it on its own
with dazzling animation, music and characters.  Its too bad this film will be released on a burned blu ray format.  Shows how much Sony doesn't care about their catalog titles.  It will not play in some players and the lifespan is considerably shortened.  This film deserves a quality release, new transfer, special features and a booklet.

Thankfully Eureka Entertainment has released a limited edition Steel book that you can order from Amazon UK right now!  A standard release will follow in March.  The film will be presented in 1080p and be a legitimate pressing on what I assume will be BD-50 discs.  If you haven't invested in a multi region player, I suggest you do right away.  UK companies have released some stellar blu rays, some even topping the standard ones here.

In this day in age where physical media is making its mark once again, the studios tend to not care as much  Only their biggest releases get the premium treatment. I'm happy we have some awesome companies such as Eureka and a handful of others preserving and releasing
these films with respect and not to make a quick buck.  Sony makes more money than god, there's no excuse for this burned method, I can imagine them losing much more money investing in cheap production rather than a quality release.

 A company that's worth over a billion dollars has no excuse for this.
Metropolis is one of the best films you should watch, just don't buy this release.",1484524800,43,1623,4.705673758865248
3535340,5,B000065F8D,"This is by far the best Movie I have ever seen.  Osamu Tezuka (Forgive me if I spelt it wrong) the original writer of the comic (And also for Astro Boy) is the grand father of manga (Japanese comics), Metropolis being one of his earliest works.  This movie doesent shove Disney, it blows it to Kingdom come.
Animation: 10 stars
Music:  10 stars
Story:  10 stars
Perhaps you think I am I bit over board in my review, but this truley was the best movie I have ever seen.  Rent it, buy it, tape it.  Do what ever you can, you must see this movie.  Maybe not young children (Violent scenes, but no sex).",1047168000,,599,4.201754385964913
3535341,4,B000065F8D,"Osamu Tezuka wrote ""Metropolis"" prior to the huge success of his Astro Boy manga and the hit T.V. series that followed.  Tezuka never completed ""Metropolis"" to his satisfaction but it has now been brought back to life by Katsuhiro Otomo (creator of ""Akira"") and Rintaro (from the Astro Boy T.V. show).  A detecive, Shunsaku Ban, and his nephew, Kenichi (both are in the original Astro Boy manga), travel to the tri-level city of Metropolis in search of an organ smuggler.  Their search takes them much deeper into the heart of Metropolis than they ever thought.  The powerful Duke Red has created a superhuman android through which he will be able to control all robots.  This android is in the form of his deceased daughter Tima.  However, before she is completed she is lost in the labyrinth beneath Metropolis and meets Kenichi.  What follows is a story of innocence betrayed by corruption and the ironic justice that must follow.
There are wonderful backdrops throughout the whole movie.  Many of these were created using C.G. but are flawlessly integrated.  The characters are drawn in that typical Tezuka style and any Astro Boy fans will love little camios by Tezuka's regular ""actors"" such as Lamp and Kim Sankaku.
The plot is intrigueing, the visuals are great, and there is a lot of social comentary thrown in.  All in all a fantastic movie for any anime fan and a good intro to anime for those not familiar with the genre.",1041120000,,1433,4.788617886178862

8294347,3,B000065F8D,This movie is amazing and a must watch. But the quality of this bluray is  unacceptable. It's blurry and not any better than my DVD version. I wish I would've listened to the other reviewer's here before I got this. So yeah avoid this till a better quality version shows up.,1495497600,7,274,4.372549019607843
8294348,3,B000065F8D,"I bought British Blu-Ray release on-line directly from Eureka.  It plays perfectly on standard Region 1 player.  However, as noted by a reviewer of the 'on-demand"" manufactured US release, it is only marginally better than the horrendous original DVD release, appearing to  have been copied from the soft, washed out and blurry original US DVD.  It is cheaper to order from Eureka than to buy the ""on-demand"" US release and their's may or not not last longer than it. But it certainly does not meet any acceptable Blu-Ray standard.  My rating splits the difference between the anime and the (abominable) disc.",1492300800,,609,4.99009900990099
8294349,1,B000065F8D,"Magnificent movie, and I'd been waiting for Sony to make a Blu-ray release. Unfortunately, they have slapped buyers in the face again with an *expensive* on-demand burned Blu-ray which will not have anywhere near the longevity of a pressed disc.  In addition, they charge what you ought to pay for a high quality 4k transfer onto a commercially produced pressed disc. It's an insult. Buy the DVD instead, or the Eureka UK release . . . if you have an all-region Blu-ray player that can handle Blu-rays locked to Region B (Europe and Oceania). Don't guess at this. You'll *know* if you have one. In North America they must be purchased from businesses that specialize in making them.",1492214400,4,682,4.779661016949152
8294350,3,B000065F8D,"First off. The film is fantastic. I have two big problems here though. For one, I didn't know that this blu ray was ""printed on demand"" by Amazon at the time of purchase. Yes, this is a note on the product page (which may not have been there when I preordered) but I didn't know that was a thing. Why would I ever look for such a note? This is a new program from Sony for some of their catalog films. I guess it's cheaper for them to license out the film assets and let someone else print the disc.

I wouldn't be so opposed to this except amazon uses (it seems) consumer grade equipment to do this rather than a more professionally ""pressed"" disc. I have no idea if this effects the film's picture and audio quality at all, but it certainly won't last as long.

Second, the picture quality is marginally better than the DVD version. I think they did a digital transfer of the old film assets rather than some kind of digital intermediate. Then they didn't bother to do much in the way of restoration. The result is an often dark, grainy, soft image.

All that said, if you've never seen this film, your interested, and have no other way to see it. Go for it. The film is one of the best Japanese animated films ever made in my opinion. It's also a great reminaging of Fritz Lang's classic.",1490400000,12,1290,4.278688524590164
8294351,1,B000065F8D,Save your money . This version is just a -R burned disc . Theres another company that will be releasing a normal blu ray release at some point in the near future . When will the zavi version be released in the u.s. ?,1488672000,,216,3.9318181818181817
8294352,4,B000065F8D,"I wanted to share my thoughts on this as all of the other reviews have so far been upset that this is a ""burned"" blu-ray disc and not an actual review.

To start off, this is a ""burned"" Blu-Ray disc - it's part of SONY's Choice Collection which allows them to release titles that may not otherwise get a blu-ray release, by offering a burn-on-demand limited run.

Despite what others say, the disc DID play on my PS4 Pro (using current software) without any issues.

The disc comes in a normal Blu-Ray case with very nice cover art. The audio is presented in English and Japanese DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio. Video is 1080p and 1.85:1 ratio.

The disc itself is basic, a white label with the title on it and (without using a computer, just judging by the data on the bottom of the disc) appears to use about 90-95% of the capacity of the disc.

Features on the disc include a Filmmaker Interview (this appears to be from a DVD and is low quality. There is also a theatrical trailer).

The video quality on the disc is GOOD. It's nice and sharp, but has a fair amount of noise throughout. It's a definite improvement over the DVD release and the noise appears to be from the film itself. Small details/words can easily be read and the colors are also good. I was expecting a bit more, but I assume that's more due to the master than the fault of the disc.

I do wish the release were a bit cheaper. At 27 bucks, it's fairly pricey.. but its also the only US release of the film on Blu-Ray.

You can import it for about the same price, but I wouldn't expect too much of a difference in quality.

The movie itself is very good -- you're best off watching a trailer for it or reading the reviews from the DVD Version to see about the movie itself. I owned the DVD years ago and loved it - I'd put it up there with a lot of the other titles like Akira and Ghost in the Shell as a very enjoyable Anime. It's much different from a lot of the modern day series' you see and has a very classic look mixed with some more recent technology like CGI.",1487808000,8,2030,4.197943444730077
8294353,3,B000065F8D,The Eureka steelbook is region free. I tested it on  my Maxmade portable Region A blu ray player. Just an FYI to those who do not want to buy this lazy release by Sony.,1486771200,9,168,3.9411764705882355
8294354,5,B000065F8D,"[from a recent Amazon review]
""Eureka Entertainment has released a limited edition Steel book that you can order from Amazon UK right now!""

Yes, I did so, and this 2017 release is light-years better than the previous Columbia Tri-Star 2-disk release that I bought about a decade ago. Maybe only a couple other of of the 700+ Blu-ray disks I own has such subtle coloration and incredible resolution - NONE of which was visible at all in previous editions. A classic release of an anime classic.",1485993600,2,494,4.744186046511628
8294355,1,B000065F8D,"Since we're only assuming, I'm assuming this will be a great release.
