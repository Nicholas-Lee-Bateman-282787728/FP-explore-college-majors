It says disc is not supported when it come up. And neither of them look like a normal dvd even though it says its a dvd.  Very odd. Just don't know what to do. Id just like to watch what i paid for....",1488153600,,359,3.9178082191780823
8579526,5,B00CAZOIBK,"I didn't have high hopes for this show.  The box cover looks kind of cheesy.  I fully expected to watch 5-10 minutes, and then turn it off.  I ended up  binge watching the entire series in one night.  It consists of 6 different, 30 minute, violent and gory horror stories, with a wrap-around story of a young, reclusive man who collects true stories of the supernatural.  There's possession, witchcraft, demons, infanticide, cyber stalking, etc.  Each story is very unique, well-written, and well acted.  I hope they release another season.  Highly recommended!",1473379200,,561,5.076923076923077
