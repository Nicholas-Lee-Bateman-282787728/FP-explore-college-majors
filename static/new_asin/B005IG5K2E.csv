8474568,5,B005IG5K2E,"PLOT: docudrama of the planning and trail leading to Bin Laden and the raid and his final days.

This is the BEST of the Bin Laden docudramas of last days. This one starts with his back ground but moves along very well. The CIA picks up the trail via a courier. Using drones, satellites, and human surveillance he is trailed to a compound in Pakistan. History shows no phone lines, they burn all their own refuse, and people including children seldom leave the compound. Several undercover teams are soon observing the compound night and day. As the odds are made on if this is the final hideout for Bin Laden a 60% chance are the odds give it is. President Obama give the go ahead for a Navy Seal team and stealth helicopters travel to the compound. The President and the security staff watch at the White House via real time video of the trip to and blast into the compound. On the third floor they shoot Bin Laden and with facial recognition software and DNA testing they verify it is the real man. This is excellent. It holds the interest. Best actual detail of any DVD I have seen. I give this one 5 STARS~",1497657600,,1111,4.393203883495145

Even though everyone watching will know the eventual outcome, the story of how this top secret operation came to be, how meticulously it was planned will entertain you, excite you and most important, bring out your pride in being an American. The best line in the entire production was stated by one of the military officers when he said ""The very last thing Bin Laden saw, was the muzzle of a machine gun and the face of an American navy seal""!
