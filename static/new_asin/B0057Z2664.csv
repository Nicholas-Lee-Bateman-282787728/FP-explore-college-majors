8461191,5,B0057Z2664,"As promised, this instructional DVD provides a gentle introduction to using a Windows XP computer.

Ideal for adult education and public libraries, this program is designed for 'computer shy' adult learners who want to learn basic computer operations in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.

This program is actually also pretty fun to watch!

More advanced computer users may pick up some tips and tricks but this program assumes no previous computer knowledge and does not bore and/or confuse viewers with technical jargon and things they don't need to know.

The goal of this program is to get the adult learner up to speed with using a Windows XP computer in just under an hour.

This DVD can be played on desktop and notebook computers that have a DVD drive but looks best on a TV.",1309564800,,793,4.717391304347826
