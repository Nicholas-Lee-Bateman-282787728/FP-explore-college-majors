5731739,5,B00CP4Y5T6,Love this movie! Sound is a bit low but it is good and it is new and he watches so much he can recite. lol Great movie! Thanks for your prompt and courteous service! Recommend they are fast and reliable!,1413763200,,203,4.1
5731740,5,B00CP4Y5T6,"Unlike a lot of moms who complain about Caillou, I don't mind my children watching it.  They've both learned quite a bit from Caillou (they talk about blue herons, they've learned what a zamboni is, and they know that snails eat algae)!  I know that a lot of mothers complain that Caillou whines (as all children do), but I think he's respectful, and his parents teach him kindness and compassion. The show also models plenty of family time as a foursome. My children enjoy it because our son is slightly older than our daughter, so they identify with the big brother/little sister family.",1399852800,5,589,4.70873786407767

5731743,5,B00CP4Y5T6,My 3 year old daughter really loves Caillou and this DVD is no exception.  Fun episodes and great life lessons for kids.,1378425600,,120,4.454545454545454
5731744,1,B00CP4Y5T6,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.
