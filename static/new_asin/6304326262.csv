877145,1,6304326262,"Harlan (Dennis Lipscomb) is obsessed with discovering who's stealing his milk every morning, ignoring his frustrated young wife (Deborah Harry) in the process. Mayhem ensues.
 UNION CITY is a hyper-stylized neo-noir that never takes off.  The sets are flooded in loud reds, or blues, or greens.  The direction is loose and the acting is almost uniformly mediocre.  It's apparent director Marcus Reichert was aiming at atmosphere and ambience, but in my case he missed by a country mile.  The only spark of recognition generated by this one was when Harlan says of a crazy neighbor lady: ""Don't tell me you can understand what she's talking about.""  Nope, can't say that I can understand.  Can't say that I much care, either.",1090022400,,724,4.983333333333333
877146,4,6304326262,"...Union City is the ultimate French existentialist thriller - you hang on every word like a meathook - but made in New Jersey in 1979. Firstly, you have got to get off on the images, which are like rotting fruit, and, secondly, you have got to wonder at the conviction of these actors, especially Deborah Harry, who all give the most extraordinary dead-pan performances....",1027209600,2,374,4.859375
877147,2,6304326262,"Long awaiting this release on DVD and fully expecting technology to chime new life into this dark pleasantry of a Debbie Harry fan's movie, I was virtually STARTLED at the grain and blocking of color that Union City in DVD format suffers.  Sometimes the images appear to actually be a grid of sorts with the worst-ever digital transfer possible.  You see a milky haze over the entire production along with the ""jigsaw puzzle"" appearance of some of the shots not noticed on VHS tape copies.  An ""SLP"" recording of Union City on a bad VHS tape that is 15 years old is actually clearer than this DVD and I can prove it.  I wouldn't have wasted my time if I weren't so angered at the loss of money and hopes.",1012176000,10,704,4.392307692307693
877148,4,6304326262,"Based on the short story ""The Corpse Next Door"" by Cornell Woolrich (dating back to the '40s), Union City is a great example of what you can do with practically no money for a feature length film noir.
A big reason for this is the director, Marcus Reichert.  Prior to (and after, as well) making this film, Mr. Reichert was known principally as an artist.  Sense of color is a particularly strong element in this film; in almost every interior set, we see striking primary colors predominating.  In Harlan (Dennis Lipscomb) and Lillian's (Debbie Harry) apartment, the living room is a deep disturbing red; another room's blue; a third, green.  In one scene, Lillian wears a bright yellow dress that almost makes your eyes water.
The actors are all fine here.  Lipscomb and Harry are well matched as a dysfunctional couple.  Everett McGill turns in a solid performance as the hunky superintendent.  And Sam McMurray, CCH Pounder and Pat Benatar (I guess this was a queen of rock casting film!) are all right on target in their respective roles.
This is a story of anxiety, obsession, murder, and guilt.  It's an edgy work well complemented by the moody colors of its sets.  The dialogue is a little stilted, but you can see that these slightly awkward phrases work well in the context of the jittery atmosphere.  The two principals both have something to be agitated about--murder and adultery.
And with the price of this DVD, this is a real bargain.  Buy it before it goes out of print!",1005782400,13,1486,4.72093023255814
877149,5,6304326262,"From the very beginning, this well constructed collage of detail has the viewer spellbound.  Like so many 40+ viewers, I grew up with the Marx Brothers as ""B"" movie TV entertainment, and have never experienced the sheer joy of seeing them live on stage, or joining an enraptured cinema audience.
The wealth of information, and sympathetic handling of the lives of the brothers is commendable, and the relatives give tantalising glimpses of the offsatge personalities.
Harpo emerges as the the most endearing of the brothers, and I challenge anyone to read Alan Sherman's tribute to him, without shedding a tear.
This now has pride of place in my collection, and is a true heirloom of comedy",976147200,,690,4.948275862068965
877150,3,6304326262,Set in the early fifties this  homage to film noir has  some good intentions as an art film. Great soundtrack by Blondie 's Chris Stein and a so so performance by Deborah Harry who in a mousy brown wig is  deglamourized and overshadowed by the male lead Filmed in early 1979  but  not released till 1981 ending.is interesting,938908800,,325,4.5344827586206895
877151,3,6304326262,"Such as myself. Although I'm finicky about her music, and don't like some of her songs, there's something about the woman herself that's made me a rather devoted Deborah Harry accolyte. Movie-wise, I liked her performances  in ""Intimate Stranger"" and ""Videodrome"" much better.  Anyone looking for Deborah Harry visual material would do well to choose  those instead (especially the former). This one failed to showcase her  properly. Although first-billed as the picture's star, her character was  consistently stepped on and overshadowed by her male lead (the husband),  the fruit-loop ""contessa"" and even the alleged  ""victim"". (And putting this beautiful woman in that dark-brown  hair-do in the first half was a criminal act!) Director Reichert would have  done well to expand Harry's character and blow away some of the useless  dialogue of the others (half of the husband's scenes in his office could  have been axed.)The inclusion of equally talented diva Pat Benatar, also in  a non-singing role, was a nice addition. I enjoyed her too brief  performance. For a non-actor, Pat did OK. Conclusion: unless you want this  for the ""Debbie"" drawer in your collection, rent it. Two of the  stars for Deborah, one for Pat, zilch for the rest.",929491200,,1243,5.145
7871248,2,6304326262,This flick is sheer amateur hour.  Definitely a low budget affair it struck me as a passable student film.  I wasn't sure if it wanted be a homage of noir or a parody of one.  I thought the premise of the uptight accountant (Dennis Lipscomb) with the repressed young spouse (Debbie Harry) obsessing over who was stealing his milk from the door of his New Jersey walkup was momentarily amusing.  Then the joke gets dragged out to the point where it's just plain tedious.  Whatever semblance there is of a story goes absolutely nowhere.  By the time this one's over you just let out a big yawn.  Blondie fans may be intrigued because of Harry's presence and Chris Stein offers what purports to be a soundtrack.  I don't think Pat Benatar utters a syllable as a newlywed.  There's nothing in Kathryn Bigelow's script that would suggest the talent that would later emerge.  A curio at best that if you must should only be seen once.,1521936000,,928,4.569696969696969

7871252,1,6304326262,This is one of the ugliest movies that I have had the displeasure of sitting through.  Where does the money come from to make this kind of thing?  I wish I could give it no star.,1335830400,,178,3.9166666666666665
7871253,3,6304326262,"I remember seeing this movie back in the early 80s when I was a kid and loved it even then, as it featured two female rockers Debbie Harry and Pat Benatar in their film debuts - not to mention an authnetic retro film noir feel and amazing cinemtography from Edward Lachman (!) - this movie would never be made like this today: this film gradually unfolds at a deliberate pace, taking its time to build character, mood, and plot - today it would be 2-3 second edit/edit/cut/cut MTV style takes.  Sigh.  Anyway, if you really like this film, you should search out the OOP UK import DVD released by Tartan Video - that DVD version features a cleaner transfer (not sure if remasterd, but I have both DVDs, and the Tartan DVD print looks markedly cleaner) - plus the UK DVD features bonus features like: Debbie Harry early screen tests, the original vintage trailer, and more.  They used to show this flick in the early days of HBO - now you can add it your collection. A must-have slice of memorabilia for Blondie fans!",1302912000,,1015,4.505434782608695

7871255,5,6304326262,"The first neo-noir, Marcus Reichert's UNION CITY was selected for the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes in 1980, and was hailed by Lawrence O'Toole, film critic for Time Magazine, as ""an unqualified masterpiece."" The film has been hugely influential, especially among younger filmmakers. Now considered a classic, the film was the centre-piece of the neo-noir festival held in 1997 by the American Museum of the Moving Image. UNION CITY is in the Film Archive of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Many individuals who have gone on to substantial careers in the industry were involved in the making of the film, including Kathryn Bigelow, Stefan Czapsky, Edward Lachman A.S.C., Dennis Lipscomb, Everett McGill, Sam McMurray, and Monty Montgomery. No less notably, Deborah Harry made her dramatic debut in the film.",1289001600,,812,5.253846153846154

7871257,1,6304326262,"... best thing it gave rise to was ""union City Blue"", one of their best singles.  Debbie singsa about the pain of getting up to go and shoot this crap on set.

It's total garbage as an ""existentialist thriller"" or anything of merit.  Just bad pseudo-intellectual rubbish, best-forgetten about by Debbbie Harry or anyone else thinking that this is a tribute to Truffaut... GROW UP!!!
