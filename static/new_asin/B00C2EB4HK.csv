8576510,5,B00C2EB4HK,"This is a wonderful documentary.  While it maybe painful to watch & listen to, the stories that are told by those who lived through the experiences, are filled with hope and inspiration!  These are the true heroes that persevered throughout their ordeals to bless us with their stories of courage and understanding.  This is a film that should be see by all, and especially our children.  It reminds me of our responsibility to ourselves and others, and how if we can be open to others pain and suffering, and success, we can be more contacted to world around us.",1399334400,,563,4.656565656565657
8576511,5,B00C2EB4HK,"This is a painful, poignantly uplifting, and ultimately gentle invitation into the lives of people, told in their own words, who have survived terrible things that no human being should have had to endure. The depth of their pain and suffering becomes the grounding for the extraordinary depth of their resiliency and strength. It reminds me of the end of King Lear: ""The weight of this sad time we must obey, Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say. The oldest hath borne most; we who are young, Shall never see so much nor live so long."" Their stories are gifts, each one, for all of us to treasure as inspirations to prevail against whatever challenges we face in life. I am grateful to them for sharing such difficult memories and their journeys beyond survival--shared in hopes that these will give others strength who hear them. It is especially inspiring to see unfolding the powerful impact their stories have on their families as they revisit their most difficult struggles--often memories they had never shared with their children and other relatives.",1374278400,3,1066,4.862637362637362

8576513,5,B00C2EB4HK,"I recently caught just part of this documentary on The World Channel and knew that I had to see the film in its entirety. Buying the DVD was the only way to do that. This is not an easy documentary to watchgraphic photographs and clips of Nazi concentration camps play a significant role in itbut the words and deeds of all those who have survived horrendous adversity are very important for the rest of us to see and hear. Whether the person profiled has overcome disease/illness or brutal poverty, the stories are both moving and powerful.",1370908800,,541,4.645833333333333
8576514,5,B00C2EB4HK,"You must buy this dvd. I have now seen all of Susan Polis Schutz's documentaries and this one is another masterpiece and proof of her outstanding artistic sensibility. The sense of hope and joy it exudes is totally inspiring. Each story focuses on a remarkable individual who has survived a profound crisis and emerged stronger with a sense of renewed humanity. I'm sure that each viewer will identify with one or more of the subjects, but it's the total mosiac, the diversity of experiences presented that makes this documentary so evocative.",1367971200,3,543,4.978021978021978
8576515,5,B00C2EB4HK,I stumbled across this documentary on PBS the other night and I loved it.  It's a series of interviews with people who have survived some of the worst experiences that life has to offer and encountered some of the worst evils of humanity. They tell what they lived through and how they did it.  There's an odd and interesting variety of persons and experiences included.  They are amazing characters who personify resiliency.  Watching them is very inspirational and causes the viewer to count one's blessings.,1365638400,7,510,4.964705882352941
