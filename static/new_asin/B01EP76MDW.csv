8759358,2,B01EP76MDW,Contains key information about the steps required to fly your new drone. This information is presented in a very home made video way which makes it hard to justify the $35 DVD cost. The biggest complaint is that the screen shots when outside flying the drone do not match what the drone video camera is seeing but shows the same indoor location when the on screen options were first covered in first part of the video session. Found this a bit confusing as the narrator does not mention this or has a subtitle on screen highlighting this mismatch,1491350400,,546,4.581632653061225
8759359,5,B01EP76MDW,"This is a great program for Phantom 4 owners who are just getting into the hobby of flying drones.  My Phantom 4 is an awesome aircraft but being new I did not want to crash it.  I had heard too many stories and seen crashes on YouTube.  The author has organized the material so it is easy to follow, get set up and get started on the right foot.  This program saved me lots of time getting the firmware installed.  That would have been really confusing without the training.  Also when I started flying, because of the training, I already had a pretty good idea of what to expect and how to say safe.  For about 35 bucks this is a very smart investment!",1483833600,2,654,4.225806451612903
8759360,5,B01EP76MDW,"I have been looking at drones for the last few years and finally pulled the pin and bought a DJI Phantom. 4. Immediately after I placed my order I realized I needed help to ensure I could protect my investment (minimize the likelihood of crashing this thing on its first flight!).  Thank goodness I found Jim Bendewald's Phantom 4 training program.  I was delighted with his comprehensive approach from 'whats in the box', set up, first flight, features, and the ever important 'what to watch out for' throughout the program.  I am happy to report that my Phantom is still in one piece, and using Jim's methods I was able to teach my grandson how to fly safely.",1474848000,2,661,4.584745762711864
