1407210,2,B000059HF4,I saw this movie after the first two of the same day and I can say this was not a good one the best part was the two guys always doing dumb things and the pinto that they drive. The actors were not good and was a let down from first two movies,1458691200,,243,3.6037735849056602
1407211,5,B000059HF4,Love it the quality of the video is great I love Beethoven. This is my favourite .,1454976000,,82,3.8823529411764706
1407212,1,B000059HF4,I loved the first two Beethoven movies as a child and was happy to see there are newer ones now. It was so terrible that I barely made it through the first 25 minutes and I really don't have very high standards when it comes to movies like that. Terrible acting and a flat story line. I don't even know if I should give the other new ones a try now ...,1452384000,,352,3.9027777777777777

1407238,5,B000059HF4,Even though this movie has a new cast it is still funny with the new cast in Beethoven's 3rd! The stuff they do is so Funny and I'm glad that I have this movie on DVD.,1399680000,,167,3.6666666666666665

1407260,3,B000059HF4,"My grandchildren loved it, just as they have all of the Beethoven movies so far.  I thought this one was rather contrived and iinane and didn't enjoy as much as the other ones I have seen.",1374710400,,188,4.222222222222222
1407261,5,B000059HF4,I like this Beethoven's 3rd family DVD movie and this Beethoven's 3rd  is the excellent DVD movie for the others.,1371945600,,113,4.65
1407262,5,B000059HF4,This movie is so fun. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of  Beethoven. Highly recommend.,1357948800,,114,4.428571428571429
1407263,1,B000059HF4,"I didn't like this movie. The original 1 and 2 were better. After those two, the dog gets annoying. Also, I liked the actors better in 1 and 2.",1318464000,,143,3.9655172413793105
1407264,4,B000059HF4,sorry that it took so long to review this my computer has been down for awhile. my daughter really likes this,1279065600,,109,4.238095238095238
1407265,1,B000059HF4,"On a day when you've phoned in sick to work, only to realise you get very easily bored of lying on the couch, trying to sleep, the ideal thing would have been something light & fluffy.

What exactly was the point in making yet another Beethoven? When the original cast refuse to come back, it should be easy enough to work out that the audience just isn't there. You've done, it's over. Particularly if you're just going to do the same story again. With a very annoying cast.

I watched barely 20 minutes of this film, before realising I had a better selection in my DVD case than this. Shame it came packaged with the previous two, but I suppose I'll just have to put up with it.",1194912000,,680,4.3046875
1407266,4,B000059HF4,"I take great pleasure in the ridiculous situations which arise in this family and the dog. They make me laugh. I find this dog pleasant and congenial, so I love every one of his films.",1127606400,,184,4.285714285714286
1407267,5,B000059HF4,"I don't know why so many people have a problem with this movie.  Maybe the lack of gratutitious sex, violence, and foul language.  Maybe they just need to get in touch with their inner child.  It's just good clean fun, and I can watch it over and ever.",1117756800,,252,4.208333333333333
1407268,5,B000059HF4,if you are a dog lover this movie is for you fun and full of excitment,1100649600,,70,3.4375
1407327,5,B000059HF4,"A cute, charming and heartwarming movie that everyone should add to there movies! Any dog lover would like this movie and who could not fall in love with this dog!",1063584000,,163,4.466666666666667
1407328,2,B000059HF4,"I haven't watched the original Beethoven or its immediate sequel.  This third installment is a big letdown.  OK, maybe it's because I'm a grown-up.  Kids did like it.  But I found the acting amusingly terrible, esp. the phony performance put up by the wife.  The kids are not even likable.  The Penny girl is kinda pretty but not particularly convincing.  The two villains are the bright spots besides the dog (or the three dogs that play Beethoven), but after about 60 minutes, nothing in this movie has any redeeming value left.  I pretty much fast-forwarded the last 20 minutes of this 90-minute film.",1059177600,,604,4.796116504854369
1407329,1,B000059HF4,"Straight to video nonsense with Beethoven returning once again with a new batch of cutesy puppies. Wondering why the original cast are missing?  Simple- the new family are their relatives and have been so kind as to take care of Beethoven.
The only recognisable actor in the film is Judge Reinhold who plays the father in the family.  Beethoven's 3rd is basically a film which trys to act as an improvement and replacement on the original Beethoven movie.  In the end though, it just proves to be completely unnecessary and ridiculous.",1045526400,,535,4.857142857142857
1407330,1,B000059HF4,"There is only so much you can do with fifteen minutes of dog footage, and a two hour feature film is not a viable option. Granted it is difficult to make a movie for children when your main premise has been done before - and better - but the direction of this film was disastrous, apparently relying solely on a few moments of animal appeal as salvation. Still, indications are that young children do enjoy the film; young girls will identify with the daughter's plight to be heard, young boys will get a laugh out of the recurring poop and fart jokes, and some of both will cheer Beethoven when he gets to make his brief appearances. Adults, however, will only derive pleasure from the children in the audience.",984614400,,712,4.5271317829457365
1407331,5,B000059HF4,"I rented this video for my children.  Since then, they have repeatedly  asked me to purchase it.  I haven't heard that much laughter come from them  while watching a movie in a very long time.  Perhaps, it is not the  greatest entertainment for adults.  But let's be real.  How many adults are  going to be dying to go out and rent a Beethoven over an adult oriented  comedy!  I gave it five stars for my children.  It was evidently the best  movie they have seen in a while!",968284800,,475,4.261363636363637
