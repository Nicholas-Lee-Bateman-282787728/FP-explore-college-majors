I'm glad this show got cancelled because of poor ratings.
Wouldn't surprise me if I saw this at the dollar store.",1415923200,,183,4.575757575757576

6647612,3,B00ND0DAVU,"Bought this as a gift and I also love this series. However, it arrived broken and does not close. Wish they would have packaged it better instead of in an envelope.",1453593600,,164,4.32258064516129

6647614,1,B00ND0DAVU,"i hate it when they try turning movies into tv shows. typically, there isn't enough source material in a 95 minute movie to base a potentially multiple-season tv show. the only way that a show like this could survive, is that they somehow develop the characters in a way that goes beyond the scope of the show and most likely does not stay true to the original tone of the movie. also, it would've been one thing if they turned the movie into a tv show, but they also decided it needed to be animated for some reason. does this movie translate into animation well? i'll let you be the judge. finally, this movie came out in 2004 but the series didn't air until 2012. i admit that the original film is an indie cult classic, but by 2012 i don't think there was much wind left in those sails. you might as well have developed 'crash' the tv series. or perhaps 'eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' th animated series. which would go along with the animated series of 'the mask' and 'ace ventura' nicely.

so yes, maybe there's enough material for there to be an episode about ligers and another where they work in napoleon doing his 'vote for pedro' dance; but other than that? probably not much else. i'd like to contrast this with the new netflix series 'wet hot american summer: first day of camp' as an example of how to successfully develop a tv show from a film.  the show matches the tone of the original perfectly and while having a plot-packed first season, additional seasons are at least perceivable.",1444780800,,1511,4.490909090909091
6647615,5,B00ND0DAVU,If u dig the movie u will appreciate this very short series only 6 episodes....but i consider the film one of the best comedies ever made so it was nice to see the characters i have grown to love in new situations....5 stars,1439078400,5,224,4.232558139534884
6647616,5,B00ND0DAVU,Love this animated series based on the characters of the Napoleon Dynamite movie.  It is hilarious.  My 10-year old son loves it.  A unique gift for the Napoleon Dynamite movie lover.,1436227200,4,183,4.838709677419355
6647617,5,B00ND0DAVU,Better than the very good movie. Cartoons allow them to do the slapstick side a bit funnier and it is a great DVD.,1434499200,,114,4.0
6647618,5,B00ND0DAVU,"Just an awesome, funny show.. Too bad they stopped making it !!",1433289600,,63,4.333333333333333
6647619,5,B00ND0DAVU,"This was a fantastic animated show. Fox was really stupid to get rid of this. In my opinion this show was as good as Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, King of the Hill, The Cleveland Show, American Dad, & The Simpsons. If Fox didn't want to continue the show they should have sold it to Cartoon Network or Comedy Central or another network like American Dad was sold to TBS. I want someone to pick this show up and continue the show. It really drives me nuts and ticks me off when networks have a great show/animation and get rid of it after 1 or 2 seasons. Why bother making it in the first place if your just gonna cancel it after a short run. Fox can't seriously tell us that this show got low ratings. Napoleon Dynamite is a very popular cult classic. The cartoon was fantastic! I would totally recommend getting this if you loved the movie!",1430611200,7,838,4.310126582278481
6647620,5,B00ND0DAVU,"OK, this is as brilliantly stupid as the movie is. You ate going to love this. Why was there only one season!!!!",1427673600,,112,4.136363636363637
6647621,5,B00ND0DAVU,"Excellent, under-appreciated series from talented creators. Well worth the money for the DVD set.",1427068800,,97,6.0
6647622,5,B00ND0DAVU,Enjoyed watching. Too bad only 1 short season...,1426982400,,48,5.125

6647624,5,B00ND0DAVU,loved this show wish there were more episodes,1424131200,,45,4.75
6647625,4,B00ND0DAVU,"Beggars can't be choosers. When this show was announced I thought it was going to be a failure because no one cared about Napoleon Dynamite anymore, i felt it was created a few years too late. Once it actually premiered though I found myself loving every second of it, and possibly seeing FOX's next hit animated series, I put a few friends on to it too and they also found it to be funny. But surprisingly the show didn't last and it was cancelled after one season. So once I saw it was coming out on DVD i was ecstatic, I got it for my sister this past christmas (as she was a fan of the show too).

I will say my biggest disappointment is in the quality. I've seen 90's shows released on DVD that look better than this one. Also the lack of special features or extra episodes (which i was hoping for) brought me even more disappointment. I voted ""I like it"", because it's great to be able to watch this unsung hero of a show, yet I am truly disappointed at the crappy quality...Gosh!",1423353600,,986,4.24468085106383
6647626,5,B00ND0DAVU,We were so mad when we found out that fox was canceling this series.  It is hilarious and 10 times better than the original movie.,1422489600,,130,4.2
6647627,5,B00ND0DAVU,"True to the movie. If you loved the movie, you will def love this serious. It had me ROTFL the whole time.",1420848000,,106,3.8636363636363638
6647628,5,B00ND0DAVU,This is just like the movie with all the same characters.  It's very clever with funny story lines.  I wish it didn't get cancelled.,1420848000,,132,4.458333333333333
6647629,5,B00ND0DAVU,I love it!,1420329600,,10,2.6666666666666665
6647630,4,B00ND0DAVU,"i would've given it 5 stars but, the only complaint that i have is that there are only 6 episodes on the dvd, other than that; i love this series (just not long enough).",1419724800,,169,4.0
6647631,5,B00ND0DAVU,"Though I haven't bought this set, I will definitely review the show itself. Do not listen to the negative comments or reviews. They were mostly made by people who didn't even like the movie in the first place. This show is one of the funniest cartoons that I have ever seen in my entire life. The story is witty and charming and the characters bring life in to this show just like they did for the movie. I wish that Fox hadn't cancelled this show and I wish that it could've gone on for at least three seasons more. But apparently more people disagree. Hopefully someday another network will bring it back. Until then I'll just keep re-watching these....",1416873600,4,655,4.512605042016807
6647632,5,B00ND0DAVU,The best animated show of all time. It is very fresh and different from anything that has ever been made.  Fox made a huge mistake cancelling this and they really mishandled the scheduling for such a short run of episodes. I have been wanting to get this on DVD since the show finished. Thank you Olive Films for releasing this! Now bring us a season 2!,1416009600,3,353,4.348484848484849
8677472,5,B00ND0DAVU,Probably our favorite cartoon EVER!,1520640000,,35,6.2
8677473,5,B00ND0DAVU,"If you loved the movie, you will not be disappointed with this DVD. The episodes are hilarious and so well written. The original cast did the voices.  My family wished there were more episodes and hated to see it end.",1514505600,,217,4.425
8677474,5,B00ND0DAVU,Smells like a burnt lasagna!! Funny show that ended too quick.,1514505600,,62,4.7272727272727275
8677475,5,B00ND0DAVU,"Although the movie is goofy with eccentric characters it isn't beyond belief in the things that happen.  Far fetched in some cases, but it isn't science fiction.  The animated series takes things to the unbelievable level as would be expected from a cartoon.  Thankfully they kept the essence of each character and made them into a caricature.  The writing is really good not relying on rehashing the movie in animated form.  Sadly there are only six episodes.  I've yet to meet anyone who has seen them that didn't like them.  This is one animated series that should have run for much longer than it did.",1509062400,,605,4.704761904761905

Super funny and still makes me laugh!",1492992000,,86,4.8
