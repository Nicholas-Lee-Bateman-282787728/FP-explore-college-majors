2117392,5,B0002S94C0,"This is a highly enjoyable miniseries. I have always enjoyed miniseries because they take the time to let the story unfold and I do enjoy a commercial free three hour movie. I very much enjoyed the story line between William H. and Felicity Huffman(real life husband and wife) You cannot help but to be drawn to the plight of Huffman's character and you find yourself rooting for her. Huffman has a very simple, quiet beauty that just draws you in.",1423008000,,448,4.6125

2117407,5,B0002S94C0,"Excellent movie...definitely a prelude to the Jesse Stone series from a character standpoint. Selleck as usual plays a strong character role; witty, straight forward, and well researched. His role as an investigator is spot on.

2117422,4,B0002S94C0,"A young woman and two others are killed in a local bar. Detective Tom Selleck and Assistant D.A. Muriel Wynn (lovers on the side) get the case. Selleck quickly 'solves' the case, Wynn prosecutes, and the 'perp' gets the death sentence. Then it's almost the end of the line for the death row perp, and William Macy is assigned his final appeal. Two abrupt u-turns later, the original conviction is reversed, Selleck and the ADA break up (she wants to stay loyal to her husband), Macy falls in love with the former judge that handed down the sentence, and I'm a bit confused on some of the details.",1387584000,,596,4.527777777777778
2117423,5,B0002S94C0,"It's always nice to see a film that gets the facts right.  This film may show the legal profession in it's true colors, but those colors aren't bad to look at.  Death penalty cases are certainly never dull...come on, a man's life is on the line after all.  William H. Macy leads the cast as an attorney originally tasked with handling the appeal of a condemned killer but eventually comes to believe that there may be something to his client's claims of innocence.  On the other side is Tom Selleck, perfectly playing the detective who had cracked the case and gotten the vital confession from the convict, and Monica Potter, the prosicuter who successfully won a conviction and got the death penalty for the convicted murderer.  Felicity Huffman, Mr. Macy's real-life wife, plays his love interest and the judge who presided over the murder trial before being disgraced and thrown off the bench.  Glenn Plummer convincingly plays the condemned man claiming his innocence and James Rebhorn is great as the man who may hold the truth somewhere in his head...to bad he's dying of cancer or there wouldn't be such a ticking clock.  Though this film is a television miniseriesturned into a film for it's DVD release, it's definetly worth watching (make sure you have plenty of time to do so), living up to it's source material, the novel of the same name written by Scott Turow.  Enjoy.",1381449600,,1382,4.777310924369748
2117424,5,B0002S94C0,This was a good movie. I really enjoyed it. Tom was great and it makes one wonder if things like this happen very often.,1378166400,,120,4.041666666666667

2117426,5,B0002S94C0,Tom Selleck is wonderful in this story.  Great characters and great intrigue.  Keeps you wondering what will come next.  Enjoyed the characters and story.  I watch it on a rainy Saturday afternoons.  It's one of those movies you can watch more than once.,1373932800,,254,4.813953488372093
2117427,4,B0002S94C0,"First, others might make this mistake, as I did:  this was apparently a mini-series or made for TV movie.  I did not know that and thought it was a theatrical release movie. That matters because the movie is long and has very brief breaks where TV breaks apparently would have appeared in its original use. In addition, because it is a TV movie/mini-series, it is not rated. I did not notice that either before purchasing. If it were to be shown in a theatre, it might be rated ""R"" because there are some scenes of violence and sexual activity, as well as drug references, corruption of judicial/law enforcement officials and so on.  I thought the relationship between William Macy's character and Felicity Huffman's character was interesting and complex and the performances of those two actors was excellent. I also thought the actors playing Romeo ""Squirrel"" Gandalf, played by Mr. Plummer, and Farell Collins (please forgive any misspelling of characters' or actors' names), played by Mr. Moore were excellent. I didn't care for the casting of the character ""Muriel Wynn"" at all. So many close-ups of her face looking like Bambi in the headlights or of her dressed in very low-cut or short-skirted clothing did not ring true for a D.A., even a novice one, and especially one engaged in a highly sexual affair didn't square with the ""pure and innocent"" face. I kept seeing a Marilyn Monroe kind of figure playing a tough D.A. and it didn't work. I did not like the relationship she had with her husband, nor his very controlling, unloving demeanor with her and wondered what anyone would wonder:  why would she ever be with that guy when Tom Selleck was waiting for her?! Tom Selleck is always Tom Selleck in whatever role he plays, and that is actually fine with me. However, because that is his persona, it is the same one he played in, for example, Magnum P.I. and I love him in his roles but one always waits for the sly, funny quip, the sarcastic joke and so on.  In this movie, his tender feelings for the female D.A. show on his face, in his eyes, so his acting ability is more nuanced than may be usually associated with him. I think he is an actor whom people feel great affection for and who might be underrated in the ""great actor"" assessments; he is like Clark Gable, Cary Grant, and the like, actors who have a strong screen presence and identifiable persona and whose very presence in a production makes the production appealing. I titled this review ""Complex or convoluted"" because the key event in the movie is seen and portrayed from several different perspectives and thus is shown several times.  Not a ""greatest ever"" movie, but a good evening's (or several) entertainment.",1369526400,,2696,4.725531914893617
2117428,5,B0002S94C0,This is from 2004 or 5 and I missed it at that time.  Excellent script and outstanding acting.  Holds interest until the end.,1367193600,,125,4.391304347826087
2117429,4,B0002S94C0,This is rather long and sometimes boring and confusing but keeps you interested enough to see it through and appreciate the actors,1365120000,,130,4.954545454545454
2117430,5,B0002S94C0,I'm a huge fan of Tom Selleck and William Macy.  Had never seen this movie before and really enjoyed it.  Glad that I bought it to add to my collection.,1365033600,,152,4.033333333333333
2117431,3,B0002S94C0,This movie had great actors but fell short of the novel by a wide margin. Wm. Macy was the best and Tom Selleck was good. Wish it had closed captions for us hard to hear guys.,1360713600,,175,3.888888888888889
2117432,5,B0002S94C0,I hadn't seen this movie yet.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed William Macy's character.  I thought the acting was well done by all the characters.,1357948800,,161,4.888888888888889
2117433,5,B0002S94C0,"This is a film based on a book by Scott Turow. The film runs to nearly three hours, which you need to cover all the twists and turns in the story, right up to the closing minutes. Let me see if I can summarize the main points. The story opens with a dispute in a caf-bar, the Paradise diner, as a result of which three people are killed, including the caf owner, Gus Leonidas (Gerry Mendicino). Sergeant Larry Starczek (Tom Selleck) is called in while he was in the middle of making love to prosecuting attorney Muriel Wynn (Monica Potter) - so she gets involved in the case too at the ouset. Another of the three victims is Louisa Remardi (Christina Collins) who works for airline boss Erno Erdai (James Rebhorn). This prompts a visit from Starczek and Erdai sends Starczek after his nephew, a jailbird called Collins Farwell (Shemar Moore). He in turn sets up a black petty thief called Romeo `Squirrel' Gandolph (Glenn Plummer), a man of somewhat limited intelligence and therefore an easy patsy. Starzeck gets Squirrel to confess and he is convicted by Judge Gillian Sullivan (Felicity Huffman) and sentenced to death.

The scene now moves to 7 years later when Squirrel is facing his last appeal before the death sentence is carried out, and many new facts appear. Arthur Raven (William H. Macy), a friend of Wynn's in the prosecutor's office, now takes over Squirrel's defence, pro bono. In the interval, Judge Sullivan has been disbarred and imprisoned for taking bribes. Other people now in turn become the prime suspects for the Paradise diner murders. The twists in the story are fascinating and Perry Mason fans will find the story engrossing, even though there are no car chases and no more bodies. The acting by the principals is convincing and I couldn't believe that nearly three hours had gone by since we started. Tom Selleck portrays Starczek with much the same personality as he does Robert Palmer's Jesse Stone.

2117434,4,B0002S94C0,"I first saw this movie on TV and after watching it I had to buy it.  What a great movie, lots of twists and turns.  This is a most buy.",1349913600,,135,3.466666666666667
2117435,3,B0002S94C0,"This one is OK, but nothing spectacular unless you just like to spend time looking longingly at Tom Selleck, who spends most of his time pining after unrequited love (Monica Potter) and as a result, tampering with police evidence in the name of it.  (He's a cop)  I thought the plot weak and nothing much original in the way of acting emerged either - but that's just me being critical.

A spastic street hobo with an astonishing tic that affects both eyes,  provides an easy mark to pin a murder on because he says anything that comes into his mind without bothering to explain it, and is given the ultimate penalty quickly.  Case Closed.  Enter another attorney who picks up on a few discrepant details, and decides to reopen.  Selleck and his love interest, who is an attorney, want to keep the verdict intact for a variety of reasons that benefit them both, while the other attorney ( William H. Macy, who turns in the best performance, in my view  ) listens to the story and sees a possible miscarriage of justice.  He is depressed over the loss of his sister, and is barely able to function on a traffic ticket case, let alone capital punishment makeover, but he decides to give it a go, supported by a disgraced female judge who is drawn into it through something she knows.

Two sessions of sheet action (discreetly muted) and heavy breathing from Selleck and his female attorney friend are intended to thrill the viewer, interspersed by long periods of sexual tension, which doesn't.

Oh, and it involves airline ticket skimming too, and clear to the top.

If you're just in the mood for simple entertainment, go for it, it's not that bad.  On the other hand, it's not very good either.",1346025600,,1695,4.61
2117436,5,B0002S94C0,"a very good movie,but a little too long now and then the story line is draged out but all in all suspencefull,and a good movie. Well recomended for Tom Sellick fans.",1345507200,,165,4.354838709677419
2117437,5,B0002S94C0,I had this one in my shopping cart for ages and finally just decided to buy it.  So glad I did.  Selleck and Macy are excellent and the plot was enjoyable.  Felicity Huffman does a wonderful job portraying the haunted former judge.  Don't know why this doesn't show up on AMC.,1344902400,,276,4.352941176470588
2117438,4,B0002S94C0,"Good movie, well acted and directed.  Thank you.",1342051200,,48,5.0
2117439,4,B0002S94C0,"Scott Turow is one of my favorite authors. I've read several of his books, but mostly some while ago. I recently reviewed his non-fiction book about the death penalty, ""Ultimate Punishment.""

The only really recognizable face in this movie is Tom Sellack, who plays detective Larry Starczek. One that kept haunting me is a fairly minor character named Collins Farwell is played by Shemar Moore. I knew I'd seen him somewhere before, and pretty sure he played a cop, but it was not until I looked this movie up on IMDB that I realized he was Detective Derek Morgan in the TV series, ""Criminal Minds.""

What we know at the outset of this film is that three people were murdered in a diner, a woman and two men. A rather flimsy trail of evidence leads Starczek to a fence named Squirrel Gandalf (Glenn Plummer), and when Starczek confronts him, he admits he doesn't know whether he did it or not. He was just that stoned. Starczek convinces him that he did, and he confesses.

Remember, this is just the beginning, not the end. He is sentenced to death, but when the appeals procedure gets down to the wire after seven years, the court appoints a successful corporate attorney named Arthur Raven (William H. Macy) to represent him. As Mr. Raven digs into the facts of the case, it becomes clear that there were a lot of problems with Squirrel's conviction.

There are a couple of love stories complicating the issue here, one that was supposedly over long ago, and one that took both of the participants by surprise. I will say no more, except that the love stories are so well woven into the criminal investigation and court case that they are indeed relevant to the story, and indeed relevant to the outcome of the appeal.

And I'm not going to tell you that, either.",1336694400,,1766,4.593650793650793

2117441,4,B0002S94C0,Sit down and focus your attention on this one.  The plot is well structured but it wanders all over the place with affairs and sub-plots.  I think everyone lived happily ever after and the bad guys went to jail.  Somehow you are never quite sure what really happened at the crime scene.

Guess again!  No subtitles, no closed captioning.  I practically had to blow my ear drums out in turning up the TV sound so high so she could hear it.  Nothing wrong with the movie.  Excellent plot.

2117455,4,B0002S94C0,"The first hour or so of this near-three hour TV movie is really slow, but luckily--thanks to a combination of interesting plot twists as well as the intriguing character and great acting of William Macy--the movie really picks up steam after that first slow section.

The plot centers on a triple murder; the central question is who actually committed this crime. One guy is behind bars and sentenced to lethal injection for it. Another guy is in prison for another crime but is very closely connected to the crime. A third guy is out of the slammer but also closely connected to the crime. On the law side, we have Macy as a lawyer, his real-life wife Felicity Huffman as a judge with whom he gets romantically involved, Tom Selleck as a cop on the case, and Monica Potter as the prosecuting attorney who's married but also involved with Selleck.

Yes, it's pretty soapy, but Macy's great acting, as well as solid support from Huffman, Selleck, Potter, and the bad guys (James Rebhorn and Glenn Plummer, especially) make this more than watchable. If you can get past the first very slow hour or 75 minutes, then settle in for an enjoyable remainder of the movie.",1224892800,,1163,4.668292682926829
2117456,1,B0002S94C0,"Save your Money! This film inspite of a good cast goes down faster than a drunk prom queen. It is very predicatble, very stiff and uncomfortable to watch. Go see the Jesse Stone series in its place and see what a real movie can do.",1210809600,,231,4.155555555555556
2117457,3,B0002S94C0,but definitely not a family movie. The Language isn't too bad but there are a few other things that make a non-family friendly too. The story line is intriguing enough to keep you interested. The acting is great.,1200096000,,212,4.605263157894737
2117458,5,B0002S94C0,"Huffman shines in a star turn about the death penalty.  republicans will not like this movie because they will have to THINK, Peo-ple!!!  Huffman is brilliant acting as her character in this. SOme people may wish she was better looking in the face as she is kind of frumpy, but she isn't Julia Roberts and doesn't want to be!!!",1183161600,,327,4.52542372881356

2117470,4,B0002S94C0,"This well done adaptation of Scott Turow's novel is a made for tv miniseries, and features an outstanding cast in a complex, but riveting story.  William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman (Mrs. Macy) get the acting honors, as their characters are more fleshed out and flawed, and their performances are wonderfully controlled and executed.  Not to take anything away from the other actors:  Tom Selleck as the cop whose devotion to his ex-lover makes him break the law; Monica Potter as the up and coming attorney who looks like she's  going to be the city's next prosecuting attorney; James Rebhorn as the security cop whose dying secret gives the plot a strange twist; Glenn Plummer as the halfwitted Squirrel who confesses to a triple murder; Shemar Moore as the loudmouthed con who finds Jesus and has his own little secrets.  Since this is a tv miniseries, the pacing does slow down some times and handicaps the movie's suspense, but overall it's an entertaining, well done film buoyed by the star turns of the Macys.",1109116800,,1017,4.82183908045977
2117471,5,B0002S94C0,I enjoyed this film.  It's probably Tom Selleck's best role and Shamar Moore did his character justice as well.  Once I saw the ending I replayed the entire DVD to go back and catch things the second time.  Knowing what motivated the prinicpal characters made it even more enjoyable the second time through.  This was a great film and it shows that a thriller can be great without the sex and extreme violence.,1104278400,,410,4.575342465753424
2117472,5,B0002S94C0,"This is a complex, riveting movie. All players turn in top-notch, believeable performances. One quibble: I would have liked it to have had a stronger sense of place; the anonymity of the locale was off-putting, but not enough to gig it a star. Still, it made for an entertaining evening.",1097884800,,287,4.76
