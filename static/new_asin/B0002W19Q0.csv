Bonus Feature-Pavarotti and the Italian Tenor
This has some memorable moments in the ""Early Appearances"" section:
-Ingemisco (Milan 1967) He's looks so young, but the voice is pure Pavarotti.
-Parmi veder le lagrime (Tokyo 1971)
Pavarotti also sings some obscure, but beautiful arias
and ""Solo e amore,"" the original song Puccini wrote to
music from La Boheme.",1212883200,5,997,6.330882352941177
