1891239,5,B00009VU39,"My two daughters really like this DVD, and so do I. We play it over and over and love singing the songs, most of them classics from when I was a young Sesame Street viewer. Highly recommend!",1099612800,,190,4.162162162162162
1891240,4,B00009VU39,"Very cute program. I just wish they showed more of the karaoke part.  Baby Bear and Tully are just awesome when they sing. My husband and I sing ""Let's Go Riding In An Automobile"" to our son all the time.  I think this program shows the characters in a more relaxed, real situation since karaoke was and maybe is still big.  If your kids love the Sesame Street songs, they will love this program.",1098144000,2,396,4.324324324324325
1891241,5,B00009VU39,"My son is 18-months old and loves the Wiggles.  I like the Wiggles too, but enough is enough.  This Sesame Street DVD was definately a nice change.  The music is great!  I even heard my husband humming one of the songs the other day.",1095379200,4,233,4.2272727272727275
1891242,5,B00009VU39,"My 15-month old daughter loves this DVD and so do I.  The songs are cute without being annoying and as always, Sesame Street is one of the easier videos to have on day after day.  The whole DVD is full of music, which my daughter loves.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!",1067817600,3,266,4.176470588235294
1891243,5,B00009VU39,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter cannot get enough of this!  It is high energy, upbeat, full of catchy songs that she loves to sing with the characters!  It has more music than storyline and is fast paced, which is perfect for short attention spans.  It also seems to be a better quality than some of the older Sesame Street videos.  If your child loves to sing with music, this is the perfect DVD!  (Parents can sing along & have fun, too!)",1066348800,10,435,4.2560975609756095
1891244,4,B00009VU39,"I would give this DVD 5 stars, but Elmo's voice just unbearable!
My son though is in love with this program. He asks to see it all the time and would dance with the characters. The only complaint - the ""Destiny's Child"" appears for exactly 30 seconds in one of the musical numbers - I thought they would sing at least one full song - not part of it. Of course, this is irrelevant for the young ones - they do not care who is singing as long as it is a nice tune.",1063670400,6,462,3.925531914893617
1891245,5,B00009VU39,Our 3 year old and 1 year old both love this DVD. We got it for our 1 year old's first bithday about 2 weeks ago. She LOVED it from the start. Usually she cries the moment Elmo leaves the screen but she danced the whole time with this one. I must say I'm so glad that the ladybug's picinic is on here. We didn't have that song on any of our 20+ sesame street video's or DVD's. I'll admit that is my favorite song!,1062720000,,413,3.8705882352941177
1891246,5,B00009VU39,"I bought this video while at the beach to have something to entertain our 10 month old. He loves it. It has great music and a wonderful story line. I wasn't sure if it would just be a bouncing ball with sing along songs. It isn't that at all. It is a sweet story about friendship and courage. I loved it. It is now one of our favorites. Finally a tape he likes other than the baby einstein collection. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1062547200,3,430,4.070588235294117
1891247,1,B00009VU39,"The Karaoke Sesame Street was one of my daughters favorite episodes, so when this came out we went right out and bought it.
It promises extended versions of the songs -- music videos of the songs in addition to the karaoke numbers.  Sounded like a nice idea, but for some strange reason the producers decided to insert the videos INTO THE MIDDLE of the karaoke numbers???
My daughter is dancing to Gabby and Miles sing ""New Way To Walk"" when bam, it cuts away to someone else singing it (and she doesn't like as much)...You know it's pretty bad when a toddler complains!!!  If they had just inserted the videos at the end of the numbers, or at the end of the video???
Anyway, it was repeated this week on PBS, and we taped it.  So we have the version my daughter wants...and this is going in the 'ebay' pile...",1062201600,,810,4.386666666666667

1891252,4,B00009VU39,too bad it's so short.  it's so cute my daughter loves it. at first I thought it's karaoke for kids with sing along to but it's actually the sesame crew singing karaoke on the show.  but still very cute,1387324800,,202,4.153846153846154
1891253,5,B00009VU39,Bought it for my 3 yr old grandaughter's birthday. She loves it! Would buy a Sesame Street Karaoke cd again!,1376179200,,108,4.45

1891257,5,B00009VU39,This video is wonderful.  My 2-year old loves to watch and sing and dance along with the video at least 5 times a day (more if we let him!)  The songs are catchy and the characters all relatable.  A great video for any child and especially those who are familiar with the Sesame Street cast.  My son's favorite is Bob :),1342310400,,320,4.19672131147541
1891258,4,B00009VU39,"The DVD provides nice entertainment for my granddaughter, however it is NOT a true karaoke (sing the words on the monitor thru a mic) type DVD. The Sesame characters actually sing in a karaoke club environment in the movie. I guess it depends on how one interprets the title (I was way off the track).",1341792000,,301,4.490909090909091
1891259,5,B00009VU39,"Sesame Street did a great job with making a karaoke DVD for preschoolers. The whole DVD played out like a typical SS show but with many, many songs. Our 3-year-old enjoyed it.",1324771200,,175,4.5
1891260,4,B00009VU39,"This is a great music DVD for kids. I was slightly disappointed that the words to the songs aren't written across the screen as the word ""Karaoke"" indicates - but it is about the SS gang doing Karaoke. But the songs are familiar and my girl loves it!",1314662400,,250,4.229166666666667

1891262,5,B00009VU39,"I recently ordered this DVD for my 6 month old nephew for Easter to keep at his house because he LOVES Sesame Street. He absolutely LOVES this movie. My daughter also has this dvd from when she was his age and she used to love it also. We love the songs and all the characters. If your little one loves Sesame Street also, this is the movie to buy!",1304899200,,348,4.057971014492754
1891263,5,B00009VU39,This is by far the best sesame street video we ever owned or have seen on TV. My 2 year old loves it!! The songs are catchy and very entertaining... even for adults!! You cannot go wrong with this purchase!,1277078400,,206,4.175
1891264,3,B00009VU39,"The first 15 minutes of the DVD sing the same three songs with different singers or backgrounds.  It is very redundant and does not flow well.  The last 15 minutes is where they actually have a karaoke party on sesame street.  Big Bird, Rosita, Elmo, Maria, and others sing songs with the karaoke machine.  I wish the entire DVD was like the 2nd half.  They could skip the first half.",1265932800,,384,4.428571428571429
1891265,5,B00009VU39,"My 17 month loves this movie.  She's Elmo crazy.  And, while this dvd isn't 100% Elmo, Elmo is the narrator and there is enough Elmo to keep her attention.  She loves the karaoke section.  And, the songs are all classics.",1259971200,,221,4.45
1891266,4,B00009VU39,"It took a few viewings for this dvd to grow on us.  The first time we watched it I was turned off by the second scene ""there is something in the air"", but my 18 month old was kept entertained by it and that is what it is really about.  The actual karaoke part was ok, I had hoped for better songs.  Over all it was worth the money but it is not my favorite sesame video.",1254009600,,370,3.779220779220779
1891267,5,B00009VU39,My son eats his meals while watching this DVD.  It keeps him entertained the entire time.  Worth its weight in gold.,1253232000,,116,4.476190476190476
1891268,5,B00009VU39,Elmo stars in this video and teaches little ones a few songs about friends.  The characters and special guests are fun to watch and sing-along with too.  My three-year-old loves the last part that focuses on the neighborhood karaoke and the ABC song at the very end the best.,1252800000,,275,4.591836734693878
1891269,5,B00009VU39,"My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD. She is just a big fan of Elmo so anything Elmo is in, she will watch it. But this is another winner from Sesame Street. It is a muscial, short (about 30 mins. in length) but sweet. Elmo narrates this one and the gang all perform different songs at their karaoke night performance. I like the fact that this is a musical with a theme and so from the beginnning of the DVD everyone sings. So it will hold the attention of your little ones if they just love to hear singing and see dancing. What's interesting about the theme is that the songs they all sing on karaoke night are all integregated with clips from either famous guest performers (like Desiny's Child performing ""Walk"" and Ben Stiller doing ""People in your neighborhood"") or clips from other episodes. Then the end finishes beautifully with a group number from Bob and the whole sesame street gang. This one is not as educational as the rest but it is very funny, engaging and very stimulating to your child's senses. I must point out though that Elmo does sing the alphabet so that is a plus too... But the reason I love it the most for my lil one is that it keeps her attention all the way through and the songs are great!!!",1244419200,3,1227,4.362445414847161
1891270,1,B00009VU39,"I'm still waiting..cannot review something i don't have! They will not answer my email. I gave one star, should be zero.",1221696000,,120,4.761904761904762
1891271,2,B00009VU39,a so so dvd which i bought without renting it first. did not keep my toddler's attention at all,1192752000,,95,4.052631578947368
1891272,5,B00009VU39,Both of my toddlers love this DVD and my husband and I remember many songs from when we were growing up. Highly recommended.,1179014400,,124,4.434782608695652
1891273,5,B00009VU39,"My 18 month-old son just loves this video and it's one that I don't hate watching over and over (and over); that's a big plus.

As usual with a Sesame Street music video, there's little or no plot. But first, I don't really expect one. Two, in this case they don't even pretend to have one (there's a short plot early on about Elmo and Rosita looking for each other) so you're not forced to sit through the usual bad plot! People getting up and singing karaoke isn't a plot. It is, however, fun.

In addition, the songs are generally quite good and include a number of Sesame Street classics such as ""I've Got a New Way to Walk,"" ""People in Your Neighborhood,"" and ""Somebody Come and Play.""

With regard to some of the criticism:

1) I have no idea why one might think that a Sesame Street DVD could be used in a karaoke machine. To the extent that I'm missing something, this person is correct. This is ""only"" a video DVD.

2) With regard to the person who complains that the karaoke scenes cut away from the Sesame Street characters to other scenes (either guest stars or the original SS scene in which the song aired), I must say that he has a point. However, I chose to not take away any stars because of it as it doesn't bother me or my son. Indeed, it had never even occurred to me as a possible flaw until he pointed it out.

Finally, while I've always enjoyed the potential side-benefit that Sesame Street may help teach while it entertains (and there is the occasional good lesson buried among the songs - such as it being okay to make mistakes), I never expected my child to learn precisely what he did from this video.  At seventeen months my son learned to say his first four-syllable word: ""karaoke.""",1168214400,,1713,4.384858044164038
1891274,5,B00009VU39,"We have quite a few Sesame Street DVDs and this one is my favorite.  The songs are not annoying and you might even get a few stuck in your head.  My son really enjoys the singing and watching the cool ""non-character"" stuff that they incorporate.  I would recommend this video to anyone looking for a GREAT Sesame Street DVD to own.",1145404800,,331,4.39344262295082
1891275,5,B00009VU39,"This has two of my favorite Sesame Street skits from recent years, which were Elmo and Rosita's play date, and Karaoke Night at Hooper's Store.  There are tons of great songs scattered in between, with several guest stars (Destiny's Child, Gloria Estefan, Ben Stiller).  This DVD is worth buying for the very funny skit with Telly and Ben Stiller at the end.  They sing ""People in Your Neighborhood"" and Ben decides he wants to be a person in the neighborhood and puts on a costume.  It is very funny, entertaining, with great songs and good guest stars.  What more could you ask for from Sesame Street?",1140048000,,603,4.650943396226415
1891276,5,B00009VU39,"I first heard the song ""Somebody Come And Play"" at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. It was performed by Sesame Street characters Big Bird, Rosita and Elmo with a live full orchestra. It sounded amazing, and catchy too. Of course I then wanted to hear the original version from the television show, and thus found this DVD- Sesame Street Sings Karaoke.

And what a lot of fun it is. You see, on Sesame Street, there's something in the air that makes everyone want to sing. And just to start things off right, the DVD starts with the full version of my favorite Sesame Street song ""Somebody Come And Play"". Elmo and Rosita have a playdate but can't find in each other, and so break into this very cute song.

We then move on into the evening and the main part of the Karaoke show where the Sesame Street family are gathered together. Various Sesame Street favorites are performed by our Sesame Street friends: Rosita sings ""You Say Hola"" as does Gloria Estefan, Gabi and Miles sing ""New Way To Walk"" as do Destiny's Child, Telly and Baby Bear sing ""Let's Go Driving"" Gina and Elmo sing ""Ladybug Picnic"", Bob sings ""People in Your Neighbourhood"" as does Ben Stiller and Elmo sings ""ABC-DEF-GHI"". There's more too. It's also perfect singing learning for kids and adults in that we can learn through the Karaoke mistakes that the Sesame Street characters make.

Note that there are no on-screen lyrics for we the audience. The Sesame Street gang have their lyrics if they need them on their screen, but we don't on our screen. Perfect excuse to simply re-watch the DVD again and again.

All in all, a very enjoyable DVD and possibly the best Sesame Street DVD out there.",1126396800,10,1667,4.602693602693603
1891277,5,B00009VU39,"My 15-month-old LOVES this DVD - asks for it by naming some of the songs -- her favorite is ""New Way to Walk"" although Elmo's cameos are a big hit also.  Great tunes that you will love as much as your child.",1124755200,,207,3.9285714285714284
