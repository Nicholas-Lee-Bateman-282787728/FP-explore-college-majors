7971714,5,B00006LPGR,"Video Arts International released this video in the mid-80's.  VAI was a pioneer in the home video industry, and at the vanguard of this adventure was entrepreneur and arts enthusiast, Ernie Gilbert, who allowed one of his young employees to pursue the signing of the rights to the TV documentary entitled THE COLTRANE LEGACY.  Previously, VAI had only ventured into the licensing of Operatic and Ballet performances, generally from vintage TV footage, for release to the home video, and the institutional video market.

Mr. Gilbert gave the ok to his 'employee' (an independent marketing consultant and musician, Marc Jacoby) to pursue a line of releases in the genre of jazz and world music.  Jacoby subsequently got in contact with the Chertok family.  David Chertok was a well known jazz enthusiast and held the rights to the documentary he created about John Coltrane.  The interviews and material were already edited by Chertok, and the completed package was the only thing available.  VAI had no control over edits, missing portions, or those who were interviewed.  VAI was certainly fortunate to have the Elvin Jones commentary, which is perhaps the most revealing and poignant insight into the essence of Coltrane.

Chertok also licensed the home video rights to VAI for the release of Trumpet Kings, and Piano Greats, both of which featured vintage footage of amazing talent, most culled from TV appearances.  The final release by VAI in the genre was OLATUNJI: DRUMS OF PASSION, a performance by the famed West African percussion master, when his ensemble worked in the mid-80's opening up for the Grateful Dead in Oakland.  The performance was broadcast live on TV, and the rights were controlled by Grateful Dead drummer, Mickey Hart, who negotiated the licensing of the home video rights with Jacoby and VAI on behalf and in conjunction with Olatunji.  Deadheads would be interested to know that Hart only discussed business backstage, in between sets, at his own performances!  The videocassette was then 'target marketed' to the great Grateful Dead community at live performance settings, through GD merchandising.

This history is presented simply to quell the criticism of those who speak negatively of the Coltrane release.  This is all VAI had to work with, and we are all lucky to have every last second of this master saxophonist providential abilities.  We should all be particularly appreciative of the life long work of David Chertok and his son for keeping these visual and audio images alive, and the courage of home video pioneer, Ernie Gilbert, for extending the freedom to his employee to pursue these releases.",1266019200,,2641,5.121212121212121
7971715,4,B00006LPGR,"For a documentary made in 1987, this is good!

It has interviews with Drummer Elvin Jones,

Piano player McCoy Tyner- and even

some old sound clips of Coltrane talking!

The live footage is taken from several old

TV broadcasts, and while we don't get any

full-length numbers, the music is still

very enjoyable and satisfying!

Today they could make a much better documentary

on Coltrane, with maybe some full performances

included on the DVD as a bonus,

But for now, go with this DVD!",1109203200,,491,4.726190476190476
7971716,5,B00006LPGR,"I first checked this out on VHS at a public library in Atlanta but ready to get it out on DVD in the near future.

This is definitely one of my favorites I grew up watching. 'cause it'll help me the face behind the musical genius himself Mr. John Coltrane. I learned so much about him since I became an instant fan to his music the first time I checked out this documentary. This is something you can't live without. This is something you collect aside your music library and others.",1102377600,,483,4.3076923076923075
7971717,3,B00006LPGR,"I have had this video on Laser Disc for some time and have watched it many times. It includes some very thoughtful interviews with Reggie Workman, Elvin Jones and others and has most of the available footage of John Coltrane. It includes all of the Jazz Casual footage and includes in its entirity the amazing German TV show with Eric Dolphy on flute, bass clarinet and, I think, alto. THAT you cannot get anywhere else. Frankly, although I am a big fan of Toby Byron's documentaries (Satchmo, Bluesland, The Story of Jazz, etc.) I think it is better than The World According to John Coltrane and uses much more live footage. The only missing footage here is the Miles Davis TV show and some obscure footage from Newport.

  That said, the production quality of THIS version is inferior to the Laser Disc version. The sound is not as clear nor are the images which look like a bootleg version. If you can get a VHS copy or Laser Disc copy do it. If not, this is still the best John Coltrane video you will ever see. Don't miss it, there is no substitute for John Coltrane in his prime and there is so little footage of both John and Eric Dolphy, especially together that you must take what you can get.

  Let's hope there is a better version released soon.",1092268800,2,1257,4.443478260869565
7971718,5,B00006LPGR,"I actually risked federal prosecution to get my first copy of this tape, sneaking through the A/V section of a local public library with a VHS recorder/duplicator in a backpack. Whether they would have really called the feds if they'd caught me, I have no idea. Let me tell you that whatever risk I was taking, it was worth it. This is the only footage I have seen of the ""classic"" John Coltrane quartet, and it is every bit as heady, emotional, and powerful as you would expect. The performances are spectacular, and the inclusion of Eric Dolphy and Reggie Workman's early appearance with the group is an added bonus for those who want to see the complete picture. For those of you who might be interested in Coltrane's ""latter"" period-- specifically the group with Pharoah Sanders, Rashied Ali, Alice Coltrane et al.-- this is not it. That said, this is an amazing document. The quartet's playing is a little more conservative on these TV appearances-- the solos are all fairly short,  the atonal experimentation is kept to a minimum-- but the structures of the songs are much more apparent in this light, and the group sounds more focused than on many of their audio recordings. At times the audio mix leaves a little to be desired, as Jimmy Garrison's contributions are inaudible much of the time and Elvin Jones' sound has certainly been better captured on the  Van Gelder recordings... However, I love the ""Legacy"" and it has a permanent place on my shelf. Just getting to see this ensemble in action is worth the price of admission. Five stars.",1050019200,,1551,4.719557195571956
7971719,4,B00006LPGR,"It is very disappointing that there are very few filmed performances of the great jazz master, John Coltrane. I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that it offers more material on Coltrane than any other DVD. This DVD runs a short 61 minutes which includes grainy quality b/w television show performances which are cut with interviews of Coltrane's former band members between the songs. Elvin Jones' comments were the most informative and entertaining. Coltrane's legacy certainly deserves more respect and attention!",1043020800,10,516,5.228915662650603
7971720,5,B00006LPGR,"With the exception of the full version of ""So What"" on a Miles Davis TV show in the '50s and a rare Newport performance, this video contains nearly all of the videos of John Coltrane that are available in their entirity. The accompanying documentary is fascinating. It includes all of the living members of his quartet and their stories are compelling. I have had this documentary on a rare laser disc for sometime now. I must admit that the DVD is of inferior quality to my laser disc but who has a laser disc player today or can find that disc? Seeing Coltrane play visually made me see just how many notes he could cram into a phrase and still sound like he was only playing the right notes. In addition, he almost looks as if he is yodeling when he plays. He was one of a kind and his like will not be seen again soon. Buy and cherish this video -- you will watch it frequently and fall in love with this timeless music. As a bonus, enjoy the alto sax of Eric Dolphy in a rare video.",1040947200,7,987,4.2

7971722,5,B00006LPGR,"""This is a must see for all Cotrane fans""...
 From Miles in the late 50's to becoming one of the jazz elite, John William Coltrane's music will always be on the fore front of any generation. This video leaves you wanting to see more of Trane at his very best. ""So What"", with Miles starts the ball to rolling, Trane is in his zone taking the tune to the outer limits. ""Impressions"", with Eric Dolphy is eye candy for the viewer, Trane and Dolphy trade licks that make the tune jump and dance all over the place. With some candid interviews for Reggie Workman, Jimmy Cobb, and Roy Haynes tug at your heart strings and make you feel that Trane was your best friend. All words were spoken with the highest respect to John, I only wish Miles would have been interviewd too. There is a voice over from Trane, telling how he had a dream that he would one day have his on band, and to hear the humility in his voice again makes you know that this man was more than just a sax player. The last three tunes Afro Blue, Alabama and Impressions are from the Jazz Casuals, and this segment gives you a more personal look at Trane as a true leader. McCoy Tyner Jimmy Garrison and Roy Haynes give all they have to Trane to make the music come full circle. I was blown away the first time I saw the video, I had heard of how Trane would play as if he was going to have a heart attack, I got a chance to see what other fans were talking about. Again this is a must see, I would give the video a million stars if I could.",1011139200,,1503,4.112244897959184
