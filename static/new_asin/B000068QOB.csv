1725998,1,B000068QOB,"I have to say that I have never found David Suchet's prissy Poirot (that voice! Ye Gods!) to my extreme liking. I have also not liked how most of the stories seem to all take place in 1935 or 1936. Nevertheless I have found the series enjoyable despite its continuity flaws. However...
These latest films (Roger Ackroyd, Lord Edgware and Mesopotamia) have been seriously bad. The acting is often very stiff and the direction very poor. The actors mostly have no charisma at all and walk through their roles without any commitment to them. The actress playing Arlene in this obviously did little if any reading of the book. The same is true of the leading lady in Murder in Mesopotamia. I doubt the producers even care if the actors in these adaptations suit the roles.
This adaptation is SO very far removed in too many bad ways from the book (Poirot at a HEALTH CLINIC???). Stick to the Ustinov film. It too veers from the novel, but in a most pleasant manner - AND the acting is flawless.
Despite what fans say, Albert Finney caught Poirot far better than any other actor thus far. Let's hope Suchet retires from this role and someone else redoes the ENTIRE Poirot canon with due respect to the novels.",1044230400,7,1204,4.578703703703703
1725999,5,B000068QOB,Honestly I haven't found a Poirot movie with David Suchet in it that I don't just love. This is one of the longer movies and I very much enjoyed it.,1038268800,7,148,3.966666666666667
1726000,5,B000068QOB,"After collapsing while eating at a posh restuarant, famed detective Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is sent by his doctor to an island resort, where he is subjected to a painful program of diet and exercise.  However, it will be his ""little grey cells"" that get the exercising when a beautiful actress is found strangled on the beach.  EVIL UNDER THE SUN is another film from the top-notch POIROT series from A&E, with David Suchet once again bringing his definitive portrayal of the Belgian sleuth to life. Hugh Fraser provides solid back-up as the rather dense Capt. Hastings, while Philip Jackson is his droll self as Inspector Japp.  As is usual with this series, the locations are wonderful and the 30's atmosphere is wonderfully invoked. This version is not to be confused with the somewhat campy film starring Peter Ustinov.  While that one is fun in its own way, it pales in comparison to the Suchet version.  As always, this flick is another delightful treat for fans of Agatha Christie's classic detective and one I highly recommend.",1034294400,31,1041,4.892045454545454
1726001,5,B000068QOB,"This newest episode of David Suchet's Poirot is wonderful!  I highly recommend it. Mr. Suchet is as always a dead-on Hercule Poirot and the scenery is beautiful.  Enjoy, well worth the money.",1033430400,4,191,4.9375
1726002,5,B000068QOB,"I have just watched this new DVD (don't ask me how I got it before the release date, because I'm not sure), and am thrilled to report that it lives up to the name of Poirot.
If you are familiar with the series, you will find similarities between this plot and that of ""Triangle at Rhodes,"" but with more players and a different outcome.  Perhaps the best feature of this movie is that all four of the major characters take part - which is unusual for the movie-length episodes.
When Poirot and Hastings retire to an island resort for some rest and relaxation (not to mention diet and exercise), imagine our surprise when a guest turns up murdered on the beach.  As usual, every person has a motive and every person looks guilty, and although the one major red herring is fairly easy to figure out (or maybe I've just watched too many of these), the plot and the outcome are both confounding and satisfying.
There is wonderful subtle humor, a beautiful setting, and excellent acting across the board - all as we've come to expect from this fine series.  I hope this is not the last.",1029196800,19,1081,4.477157360406092
1726003,5,B000068QOB,"I have to admit that I was initially a bit skeptical of this version of Evil Under the Sun, as my brother and I grew up watching the Peter Ustinov film with ridiculous frequency. And while the Ustinov has a more infectiously energetic feel and campy, amusingly over-the-top humor, I actually ended up loving this version of Evil Under the Sun even more.

As a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, this is among the sadly few full-length Poirot movies to feature Hastings, Inspector Japp AND Ms. Lemon. (Most films feature only one of the three; sadly, a handful of the films don't include any of them.) These three supporting characters are not just likable and amusing in their own right, but they serve to humanize Poirot to an invaluable degree. Their mere presence here adds a subtly warm and humorous camaraderie that makes this movie eminently rewatchable. Suchet is, as always, the quintessential Poirot. Hastings is his usual sweet, amiable and amusingly clueless self, played with underrated excellence by Hugh Fraser. The mystery itself isn't an all-time favorite of mine, but even comparatively mediocre Christie mysteries are (in my Christie-adoring opinion, of course) better paced and plotted than the vast majority of what's out there, and this one is more than sufficiently engaging. The scenery and costumes are, as is typical of this series, absolutely superb.

I've drastically cut down on my DVD buying, but this is among the rare mystery movies that I'll rewatch frequently despite already knowing 'whodunit.' Enjoy!",1408060800,,1542,5.115079365079365

1726006,5,B000068QOB,"""Evil Under The Sun"" is one of the better Poirot thrillers published in 1941. In this holiday resort thriller all the support cast ""characters"" are potential suspects but Poirot finds out the who,why,where and how of ""who done it"" which will catch out many viewers. The original David Suchet movie was made in 2000 and was one hour and forty minutes in length. However, the USA version here has ten minutes of scenes edited from the original movie without any reason except to reduce the length to one hour and thirty minutes.

1726007,5,B000068QOB,A movie based on the novels of Agatha Christie. I love all her mysteries. This movie has David Suchet as Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.

1726008,3,B000068QOB,"Evil Under The Sun, 2001 film

The story begins in an English village where a minister reads a Bible story. A man is killed, someone else gets his property. A warning about Jezebel? Outside the town the police inspect the body of a woman (strangled by the bruises on her throat). It was a murder. Hercule Poirot has problems with his jacket (common to men over forty). He attends the opening of a restaurant, then collapses during dinner. He needs rest, exercise, and a strict diet. [Note the vehicle and scenery by the seashore.] Poirot and Hastings meet the other guests. One guest says another woman is ""trouble, wait and see"". [Does this telegraph the plot?] One woman says this is a good place for a murder. Open space and sunshine? Will there be a murder? Poirot uses a steam cabinet. Later he overhears a conversation (the lifestyles of the rich and famous).

People gather for dinner. We see their actions. Poirot offers unasked-for advice. ""MYODB"". Note the high-rise vehicle used for carrying passengers. The various clocks time the events. Who threw a bottle out of a window? Guests go about their activities. A couple see Arlena on the beach. ""She's dead!"" [Any footprints around the body? Note Arlena's feet are clean.] Poirot is notified about the body. The police arrive. They can place the time of death so they check the alibis of the other guests. Who had a motive for murder? Marshal is questioned about his wife. Lionel is questioned about his activities. [Note how Poirot gauges the strength of his hand.] Lionel's companion is questioned. Mrs. Marshal withdrew a large sum of money earlier. Others are questioned. That Hidden Cove has a surprise! We learn more about another guest. And an earlier murder. Poirot has an idea. The island is unlocked, people leave and enter again.

Inspector Japp looks into that Hidden Cove and sees two visitors. [Do they look like the outdoor type?] Another guest reveals his identity. The police arrest two men (not part of the murder). The smuggler is caught. But its not related to the murder. Everyone is gathered in the dining room so Poirot can talk to them about the case. [This is an old-fashioned method for solving a crime.] He says many people were interested in the death of Arlena, for one reason or another. So who was it? Was it the man who was trying to swindle her out of the wealth she got from her much older husband? Poirot explains his deductions and recreates the events. What a clever and diabolical plan? Is it too perfect? Or believable? Can a plan that requires perfect timing be guaranteed to work? Only in a novel or movie.

Agatha Christie wrote over fifty mystery novels featuring Hercule Poirot. She worked as a nurse in the Great War. Could she have met a Belgian refugee who was the prototype for ""Hercule Poirot""? The characters Poirot and Hastings echo Holmes and Watson. Conan Doyle basically invented the detective story to gain international fame. True Crime books tell that love and money (or lust and greed) are the usual causes of murder. There were cases where wealthy widows (or widowers) were lured into a scheme to defraud and kill them. You can read ""The Case of the Amorous Aunt"" for another story on this type of crime; it has a happier ending.",1358294400,,3248,4.72310405643739
1726009,4,B000068QOB,"Last night's movie was ""Evil Under The Sun,"" a Hercule Poirot mystery episode. In this saga, Poirot passed out at a dinner party was informed by his doctor that he was too heavy. Really? Poirot? Too heavy? In any case the annoying little twerp, ably played by David Suchet, had to report to a prescription health spa on an Island resort for a two-week stay. So there was Poirot on the beach-landing in his formal attire, including hat, gloves three-piece suit and even spats and ready for his two-week regimen of diet and exercise. Well, you just somehow knew that wasn't going to last.

Sure enough, one of the female guests was found dead on the beach. and the story was underway. In this one, the clues were liberally spread, but, of course, nothing seemed to make good sense even to Poirot. Especially to Poirot, perhaps I should add. Everyone was confined to the Island with no further people coming or going. It was a nice comfortable little group. Oh, and I might add, a batch of heroin was found stashed away in a little beach cave just to make it a bit more evil. All of the clues were weighed and we had our final scene with the group of about a dozen or so possible suspects assembled with Poirot going over the clues one by one,until the perpetrator rose to confess, sans lawyer, the dastardly deed.

It was an enjoyable movie. I thought it was overly complex with too many twists and turns, but it was a quite good Poirot episode, but not one of the best. I'm amazed at how many movies have come out under this Poirot label. It must have been a very popular series and was rather well done, I might add.

1726010,4,B000068QOB,"""Evil Under the Sun"", based on Agatha Christie's 1941 novel, is one of two feature-length films that constituted Series 8 of  ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", originally aired on Britain's ITV in 2001. At the advice of his doctor, Poirot travels to the Sandy Cove Hotel, just off England's coast, for two weeks of dieting, exercise, and sea air. He is accompanied by Capt. Hastings (Hugh Fraser). Poirot immediately senses danger when he observes a pretty actress, Arlena Stuart (Louise Delamere), cavorting with her old friend Patrick Redfern (Michael Higgs) in front of their respective spouses. Arlena is widely hated on the island, seemingly by everyone who knows her, including an acquaintance of Poirot's, Mrs. Darnley (Marsha Fitzalan). So it is no surprise when Arlena is discovered dead on the beach.

Series 8 was made in keeping with the modernist sets and airy interiors of the first decade of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"". It seems slightly more forced than the ""Poirot"" of the 1990s, but the detective is affable, and the tone is upbeat. Capt. Hastings, Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran), and Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) feature in this episode -and Miss Lemon's hair is back to its natural red after an odd spell as a brunette in Series 7. There is plenty of humor, though we meet one of Poirot's most diabolical suspects. The island is closed to visitors while the murder investigation proceeds, so the suspects are stuck in a closed environment, which is always an effective device in a mystery. Hastings is less interesting than he used to be, but Series 8 is still satisfying. Bonus features on the DVD (A&E 2002) are brief text bios of Agatha Christie, David Suchet, and Hercule Poirot.",1314316800,,1696,4.989399293286219
1726011,2,B000068QOB,"I'm a Poirot fan and have a rather large collection of the Suchet DVDs.  On discovering that I lacked ""Evil Under The Sun,"" I decided to try it.  To my astonishment, this is the worst Poirot I've ever seen; indeed, it's almost a parody of the superficiality inherent in the entire series. You'll roar at the overacting (check out the wicked clergyman and the murder victim) and howl at the absurdity of the plot. You'll gag as the masks are ripped away at the conclusion, revealing entirely different people, including the villains.  And you'll guffaw at how on earth Poirot could possibly have known all of that.

No one does well here.  Hastings is overweight and enters a room almost like Stan Laurel.  Miss Lemon seems to have become less of an actress over time.  Suchet is okay, despite the padding that makes him look overweight.  Humor?  There is none.  Violence, ditto.  Script? A first class dud.  My two stars are for the photography, which is exceptional.  It's too bad that hammy actors had to ruin what would have been a nice travelogue.",1279584000,,1051,4.6775956284153
1726012,4,B000068QOB,"Yes, this particular story is long and may be a bit dry at times, but it is a mystery story and it wasn't intended to have a murder a minute. Overall, the film is well developed. If you are impatient and want to see things blown up or run over every other scene, then you may want to look elsewhere. To me, David Suchet is the consummate Poirot. I was always more of a Sherlock Holmes fan, but this series has made me a Christie fan as well. The period details are great and Suchet brings a unique energy to the stories. I saw the movie version with Peter Ustinov when I was younger and it had more humor and flair, but this version has more of Agatha Christie's feel to it than the Ustinov interpretation.

To the critics of Suchet's Poirot, I will agree that Albert Finney (and the rest of the cast) was wonderful in Murder on the Orient Express and Peter Ustinov's Poirot films had more star power and flair, but we are talking about A&E not MGM. For a ""made for TV"" series, these videos, and their Jeremy Brett - Sherlock Holmes cousins, are excellent.",1275609600,,1056,4.306532663316583
1726013,5,B000068QOB,"This is probably my favorite movie from the David Suchet Poirot series. Amazingly acted with a great mystery and beautiful surroundings, ""Evil Under the Sun"" has all the great features of the regular TV show.

After eating out at a restaurant, Poirot collapses, which is attributed to him being very overweight. So, Poirot, along with Captain Hastings, takes a trip to a health resort called Sandy Cove. But even here, Poirot cannot escape from murder for murder is everywhere under the sun-especially where Poirot is concerned.

The film is different from the book, but I think most of the changes make this film better. Unlike the book, Captain Hastings accompanies Poirot to the resort. Chief Inspector Japp also shows up when the murder is announced. Also, Linda Marshall is replaced with Lionel Marshall who only plays a small part in this mystery drama.

I highly recommend this film. The setting, partially filmed on Burgh Island, is perfect and the mystery is very intriguing. If you love Poirot, don't miss this one!",1244937600,,1025,4.982456140350878
1726014,4,B000068QOB,"Just as Ronald Colman was the best Bulldog Drummond and Rudolf Rassendyll, Colin Firth was the best Mr. Darcy (sorry, Mr. Olivier) or, getting closer to the genre, just as the late great Jeremy Brett made the ideal Sherlock Holmes, David Suchet has become the definitive Hercule Poirot. Suchet has earned this place by virtue of his very good acting and his longevity in the role. Case in point, even though I liked Peter Ustinov in his many turns as Poirot, I feel that David Suchet's version is superior. Suchet simply puts it down perfect as the prissy but astute little Belgian sleuth. In comparison and even though Poirot does favor affected mannerisms, Ustinov's take seems couched in even more over-the-top conceits.

In EVIL UNDER THE SUN, when Poirot keels over at his friend Capt. Hasting's Argentinian restaurant, he is diagnosed with being medically obese. Recommended to undertake a ""strict regime of diet and exercise, sunshine and the sea,"" Poirot is booked passage to the health resort island of Sandy Cove, accompanied by Hastings. But, even on forced holiday, Poirot's little grey cells are constantly churning away. So, in the confines of a seaside paradise, he senses and tries to avert an imminent crime, but fails. Under the afternoon sun, a strangled body is found on the beach, of an actress doomed to die. Poirot must work out the vagaries of a puzzling timetable and air-tight alibis and sift thru sordid doings ranging from indiscreet flirtations to drug smuggling, from a long harbored revulsion to typical jealousies and blackmail. As the investigations unfold, the odd little Belgian suspects that not only is the murderer extremely cunning and devilish, but that he had certainly killed before.

Naturally, near everyone is a suspect, including a most intense ex-vicar, a troubled sixteen-year-old, and even an athletic spinster. While Ustinov's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Under-the-Sun/dp/B001KZOVJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Under the Sun</a>&nbsp;is entertaining, its all-star casting exudes a certain neck-craning, celebrity-watching feel. Suchet's version acquaints us with little known actors who seem to be more suited to their supporting roles (and who also aren't too big of a name for their roles). I've gone thru pretty much all of Christie's Poirot mysteries, but it's been years since I read EVIL UNDER THE SUN, and I've forgotten how very cleverly the murder was committed. I used to read quite a lot of mystery novels and I've always held that Agatha Christie is one of the most diabolical practitioner in the genre.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Murder-of-Roger-Ackroyd-The-Agatha-Christie-Mystery-Collection/dp/0553350013/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Then-There-Were-None/dp/0671775812/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">And Then There Were None</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-on-the-Orient-Express-Hercule-Poirot-Mysteries/dp/0425200450/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder on the Orient Express (Hercule Poirot Mysteries)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curtain-Hercule-Poirot/dp/0425173747/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curtain (Hercule Poirot)</a>&nbsp;are particularly awesome in terms of the resolution to their respective mysteries.

Hercule Poirot belongs to that niche which features the more atypical detectives. Poirot, like Nero Wolfe, Father Brown, or the Old Man in the Corner, aren't lean, mean men of action. Agatha Christie writes her fastidious little Belgian with a waxed mustache, a mincing walk, and a certain smug air about him. Yet, somehow, she's always made him lovable. EVIL UNDER THE SUN isn't the best of Suchet's work as Poirot, but it'll still do very nicely. So mull over the motives, fight thru the red herrings, and see if your own little grey cells can figure it out (I was stumped years ago) before Poirot demonstrates yet again that, well-bred and -mannered and posh though they may be, the English can murder with the best of them.",1243641600,,4257,6.285958904109589

One of the variations was working in the usual cast of Miss Lemon, Inspector Japp, and Captain Hastings, none of which joined Monsieur Poirot on this vacation. The health spa story here was amusing but not part of the story.

This is one of my favorite Poirot stories, and this version does it justice. Some people like this version better, while others prefer Ustinov, but you won't go wrong either way.
