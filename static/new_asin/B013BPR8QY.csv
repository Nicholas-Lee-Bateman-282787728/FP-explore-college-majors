I haven't actually seen My Boss's Daughter to give an honest opinion. But it's not the type of movie I would enjoy anyhow.

I bought this just for Duplex. As I imagine most people did.  It's one of my favorite movies, and a terribly underrated comedy. The disk plays the movie just fine, and the picture is wonderful.
_________________________________________________

Now I was fully aware that I was getting a both movies when I bought this. However I assumed there was going to be two separate disks. Nope, just one.

My main complaint is that when it starts up, it automatically goes to the 'My Boss's Daughter' menu page, and forces me to navigate my way to the Duplex menu. Why does it start with the 'My Boss's Daughter' menu page? That makes no sense for people who just want to see Duplex.

Most double-feature DVDs bring you to a default page where you select what movie you want to see. Or at the very least, are double-sided with a movie n each side. Also there were no bonus features here. Which makes no sense, because there were bonus features on the original Duplex DVD. Why not just transfer them over?

I'm not asking for much, but we were treated so well by Miramax with the Duplex DVD release (two-disks, both full and wide screen versions of the film, bonus features, and all the other accoutrements you would expect to find with a well packaged DVD), but why can't we get that same special treatment with the Blu-Ray too?

I'm happy to see Duplex on Blu-Ray. But release a standalone bluray of Duplex.",1371945600,2,1619,4.577854671280277
8727135,3,B013BPR8QY,"I wasn't after ""My Bosses Daughter"" I was after ""Duplex"" on BluRay.  But this was the only way I could get ""Duplex"" on Bluray.  I love Duplex, not so keen on ""My Bosses Daughter"" (I like Ashton, but this movie was awful).  The Bluray itself did not contain extras as I would have wanted, and the quality was only so so.",1332460800,,319,4.19672131147541
8727136,2,B013BPR8QY,"You cant get either movie on Blu-Ray so I figured I would give this double feature a shot.

Picture looks great as you would expect from a Blu-Ray, but the sound was horrid. I watched a different blu-ray before and another after and they both sounded great. This double feature just didn't cut it when it came to sound.",1316995200,2,319,4.406779661016949
