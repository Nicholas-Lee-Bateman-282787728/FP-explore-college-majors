8252210,5,B0011XEUO2,"I GOT THE SERIE OF 8 DVD'S  AT SOME DOLLAR STORE, AND I DIDN'T HAVE EXCERCISE FOR A LOOOOONG TIME, SO I STARTED WITH THIS ONE, AT THE BEGINNING WAS HARD TO FOLLOW UP BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU GET IT, I HAVE LOST 8 LBS DOING THIS ONE 5 TIMES A WEEK FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR MY IS MY HYPOTHYROIDISM... I ALTERNATE WITH THE OTHERS DVD'S (UPPER BODY, LOWER BODY AND TONING ONLY ONCE A WEEK).  I DON'T LIKE THE TIPS FROM DR. GARY IN BETWEEN THE WORKOUT, AND SINCE ENGLISH IS MY SECOND LANGUAGE IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND SOME WORDS BECAUSE THEY ARE BRITISH. BUT I RECOMMEND THE DVD'S... FOR A BUCK IS NOT SO BAD.",1209945600,4,632,4.007936507936508
