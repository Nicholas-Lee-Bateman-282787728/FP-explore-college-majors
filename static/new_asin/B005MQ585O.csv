8479634,5,B005MQ585O,"The Lucy Show came about when Desilu Studios was struggling with keeping the TV shows they produced on the air since a majority of them got cancelled. So, they asked Lucille Ball to do another TV series and it turned out to be a huge hit with ratings for each season being through the roof. It spawned six seasons and lasted from 1962 to 1968 and I'm so glad that CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) decided to release all five seasons on DVD because before that, there were only 30 episodes available on DVD (2 from the first season, 21 from the fifth season and 7 from the sixth season). Since it just wasn't enough, they remastered all of the episodes, found their vintage elements such as cast commercials and sponsors from when the show was in first-run broadcasts and released The Lucy Show on DVD from July 13, 2009 to December 6, 2011 and may I say that this was a wise move on their part because not only did it please Ball's longtime fans, but it offered more than the original DVDs did. If you love Lucy, then get these 5 seasons on DVD. You'll be laughing the whole way. Also, look out for The Lucy Show: The Official Sixth and Final Season, which is now available on DVD.",1352764800,,1183,4.357466063348416
