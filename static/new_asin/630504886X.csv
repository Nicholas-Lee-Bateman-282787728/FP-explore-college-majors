953985,1,630504886X,"When the movie stopped, I automatically woke up.  I'm a 16 year old student, and I just want to say that this movie was just painful to sit through.  The camera quality was remarkably cheap.  Meg Foster's eyes had no color, they looked like white marbles in her head.  That was just freaky.  Kevin Conway didn't do to bad, he's a great actor (just watch him in Gettysburg), but you couldn't really understand what he was saying.  The movie was true to the book, which may be why it was so bad.  The music was unsettling, even kind of satanic sounding.  Oh well.  At least I'll never have to watch it again.",984182400,,606,4.339285714285714
953986,3,630504886X,"Since I have used this video in teaching the novel to 10th graders for the  last 7 years, I have probably seen it 25 times.  As other reviewers have  stated, it is very faithful to the original, not just in the storyline, but  in the overall mood of gloom that is created, and in the dialogue, which at  times is verbatim.  The scenes between Hester and Chillingworth in the  prison, and between Chillingworth and Dimmesdale are especially well done,  as is the climactic ending (and sorry Disney fans, they DON'T live happily  ever after).  In some cases the film is too faithful.  It is described how  Pearl cries incessantly the entire time she is on the scaffold, and in the  prison.  It is one thing to be told this, quite another to have to hear it  for 15 minutes, and the microphone seems placed directly next to the  infant.  The scene between Hester and Chillingworth on the shore is nearly  inaudible due to the pounding surf. The special effects are as good as they  could be for a low budget film made in 1979, but for modern students are  laughable, especially the appearances of the supernatural ""A's"".  I felt that Meg Foster's performance was forced, and the child actor  playing Pearl was terrible, but was impressed by Heard and Conway.  Additionally, the theme music never changes, and the narrator is a little  TOO dreary. I long for a more quality version to be produced that can be  used in the classroom, but until that day, this is the best available.",968371200,50,1476,4.584615384615384

It follows the book almost verbatim, but it sometimes changes the characters' comments into narration and vice versa.  I recommend watching this BEFORE reading the book, because it allows you to know what's going on before reading Hawthorne's nuttily excessive prose.  Go ahead and hate me, english teachers.  You know it's true, though.  ALSO, here's a tip... and it's an important one:  WATCH THESE MOVIES (all four hours of them) ALONE IN A QUIET ROOM.  The sound quality sucks.  Once the windows are closed and you are supremely, utterly focused on your tv (and have managed to tune out the weird made-for-public-television movie white noise), you will be in business.

954648,5,630504886X,"Hawthorn's Scarlet Letter is well played in this rendition of the TV series. There are many metaphors....the ""Man in Black"" in the forest, can be interepreted as the ""Devil"" or simply, the wild, untamed land within. Pearl, being the offspring of the passion and love of Reverend Dimmesdale and Hester Prynne, is herself a wild, untamed child. This, all in a society, set up by men, who wished to create a ""Utopia"", whereby all people within the confines of this community would be slaves to the Religious laws, the brutal laws, which caused anxt and suffering in this supposed ""Utopic"" society.  Hester Prynne was made an example, so that the rest of the community would shrink back, would never allow their wild natures to emerge, lest they be severely punished or brought to the gallos. Laws made by men, under the guise of ""God's Laws"" - but who can truly know God's Laws? And were Hester and the Reverend truly sinners? Or were they truly in love, holding deep inside a true passion for each other and a deep love for Pearl. And isn't true love and passion as wild as the forest? As you watch this series, you will see that human nature cannot be tamed, and to do so, is more of a sin than those actions proclaimed as sinful by the mangistrates of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

954649,3,630504886X,"Recently, I have been reading and viewing Nathaniel Hawthorne's works. I also,though,am very much a part of the film industry,and production value is of utmost importance for my aesthetic sensibilities. So, when I review this 1979 PBS Produced Version of Hawthorne's classic I can say ""Bravo"" for a novel well adapted, and ""Thank God, that Public Broadcasting has come a long way in it's production values since 1979!"".Production-wise, this ""Scarlet Letter"" is simply put LOW,LOW,LOW BUDGET from costumes,to make-up,to set design to some of the worst music ever chosen for a 17th century period piece. This 4 hour mini-series,which follows the book very faithfully, will please on that point (in fact many scenes are directly lifted from the book word for word),BUT (and a very big one at that!) you must endure the rest of the package in order to ""see"" Hawthorne on the screen,and I am not willing to grant the complete trade-off. John Heard and Meg Foster,are actually quite good and convincing (even though neither is a favorite of mine) as the ""adulterous couple"" Hester Prynne and Reverend Dimmesdale. Josef Somer, who has been a mainstay for 40+ years in movies and television is awkward,IMO, as Chillingsworth, as well as the actress (forgot her name) who plays Mrs. Hibbens.
You, though,can put a silk purse in the middle of a field of dung,and what you get is a smelly pocketbook. Rent this for interest, but not a recommended purchase UNLESS you are a teacher. Now on to ""The House of Seven Gables""",1203724800,4,1508,4.940944881889764

954653,5,630504886X,"As a movie buff, I give this DVD 1.5 stars.  As an English teacher, I give it 5.

Cons:

Ultra-low budget production

Costumes meant to be dramatic, are actually comic

Filmed on video - looks and sounds almost submerged

Campy music is source of uproarous class laughter

Special effects that aren't special at all (i.e. hilarious meteor)

It takes at least one hour to get used to Meg Foster's eyes

""Boston"" has the feeling of ""this is all we could afford""

Actress who plays Mistress Hibbens attempts to act ""near the edge"" and instead plunges over it

Pros:

Extremely faithful to the book

Many critical scenes are reproduced word-for-word

High School appropriate, (unlike Demi Moore's version)

Would be rated ""G"" if it had a rating - no profanity or nudity

Quite compelling performances by Meg Foster and John Heard

Becomes strangely more and more believable as it progresses

Nice use of natural light and scenery

Convenient menus divided by titles of book chapters

Until someone decides to film this book properly, with a big budget, faithful script, THX sound and world-class actors, this 1979 PBS special on DVD is the only choice for English teachers.

There are, of course, two earlier versions.  The first is a silent film that I have not seen.  The second is from 1934 and I've seen enough of it to know that it is so hopelessly ancient, with choppy, jerky black and white cinematography and sound that seems to have come from an Alexander G. Bell wax cylinder, that high school students will likely be unable to connect with it.

The third version is this 1979 PBS miniseries on DVD.  It is four hours long, and comes on two discs packed in one box.  I have found that it lends itself quite well to being shown in conjunction with assigned chapters, and follows the book very faithfully.

All in all, I'm pleased with my investment, and while my students enjoyed laughing at some aspects of the film's (lack of) production quality, they certainly seem to have benefitted from it in terms of comprehension.  I recommend it to my fellow English teachers without reservation, until something better comes along.

Final Note:  My classes saw this DVD displayed on a big screen by a Hitachi CP-S318 digital projector feeding from a Panasonic DVD player.  Crammed down to a 29 inch TV, I'm not sure if it would be visually tolerable.  The big screen gives it, (and us,) room to breath.",1140739200,118,2401,4.738498789346247

I really don't understand people who applaud this movie. Hester Prynne's eyes looked like she was blind, they were so white. It was distracting and very strange. Pearl was just odd, and Roger Chillingworth looked like a mad hatter. Which he is, I suppose, so there's that.
Rev. Dimmsdale is rather handsome, but that is not the point!!
The camerawork looks as if someone filmed when drunk, it's so cheap.
The entire thing looks like some middle-schooler's lame attempt to make a little movie.

954729,5,630504886X,"Hawthorne's novel deserves a miniseries like this one. It takes time and the use of a voiceover to penetrate the depth of Hester Prynne's and her lover's motivations, feelings, shame and repentance. It also takes the slowness of a TV film to really explore the mystery of this community and some of its characters. There is very little action in this romance but a lot of inner and invisible suffering, torturing and yet joy. But when we have said that we haven't said much because the film here evades any simple approach, just as the novel does.

And the question is why ? Most people have concentrated on the characters or the puritan attitudes and at times prejudices. This remains shallow. To try to climb on the scaffold of this piece of fiction and discover the subject from some height, if not a bird's view at least a hanged man's view, we have to evade concrete material characters and situations and soar up to the concept of God without which nothing is understandable.

The concept of God is ever present but never really expressed and specified in words. There obviously is the punishing God of the Puritans founded on the vision of Him we can get in many biblical texts or many Christian or non-Christian documents from the first century CE, after Jesus' death, from the Dead Sea Scrolls for instance. This very strict respect of the Law and its requirements has always survived in Christianity as a dark background for many centuries and then as a reference when puritanism emerged as a religion per se. One is pure or isn't.

If one is pure, one must not in any way live with someone who is not pure and if someone is not pure the community of the pure ones has to reject him or her, and that rejection must become God's punishment, in no way human but entirely divine. This punishment has to be both public and totally interiorized. And here is one of the most important theme of the novel : Hester can satisfy these two characteristics with the scarlet letter and her interiorization of her  sin . But her lover who is condemned by her to remain unknown can only be punished inside his own self, hence he can only punish himself.

This excuses the  husband  who will avenge himself on this lover because this  husband  will become the punishing tool used by God, and yet the interiorization of the punishment by the lover himself will enable him to evade and escape the vengeance of this  husband  who will in the end be frustrated of his vengeance and punished in his turn. Is that God's punishment ? Yet there is another concept of God that is ever present in the novel. It is the concept of a God of love. Love is threefold in this perspective. It is sensual first and it may lead to sin when it is not controled and breaks a moral rule.

Then it is love coming from human reason which may lead to insanity when a social reasonable rule is broken and no repair can be found, and there is no repair except through a social punishment that does not repair anything but is a repayment for the unreasonable fault. Finally it is also spiritual and in this dimension love becomes Christian because it leads to forgiveness and love for one's enemies and love beyond mistakes and faults.

This love calls for repentance but not for punishment, at least not in the hands of men. Repentance is a great privilege for someone who  sins  but repentance has to be public in order to lead to forgiveness. If there is no forgiveness in society their God is not a really Christian God. If there is not repentance on the side of the  sinner  he or she is not Christian since she or he refuses to be forgiven or he or she makes forgiveness impossible. We can see that Hester in her repentance leads the whole community to forgiving her, whereas Arthur, her lover, not being able to repent publicly, is forced to repent in silence in his own soul without any possible forgiveness from anyone. If there is no forgiveness there is no salvation possible, there is no Christian solution.

This leads to the ending of this book that is so marvellously shown by the film : Arthur is literally forced to live his repentance as a slow sacrifice in the eyes of God : he has to die to redeem himself, his society, Hester and Pearl, to  crucify  himself on the scaffold with his women at his feet.

But what about Hester who needs in the novel Arthur's sacrifice to be fully redeemed ?

And what about Pearl who can only find the strength to kiss her father, hence to forgive him, hence to love him, when the sacrifice comes to its end ?

Is Hester vain and selfish in her human love for Arthur by condemning him to suffer in silence ?

Is Pearl beyond any Christian definition in her incapability to love her father except when it is too late to save him ?

Is the romance a condemnation of puritanism or a vindication of human sensuality and sensitivity as the only way to redeem humanity ?

Is the concept of God limited in time and space ?

And then is the future godless ?

That's what this film and the novel behind lead me to think ... at the present moment.

954730,5,630504886X,"For those (including me) still smarting over the insultingly demeaning, appalling Demi Moore film ""retelling"" of this American masterpiece, this PBS version more than makes up for the crime. It is not only faithful to Hawthorne's novel, but it does an astonishing job of being very nearly the ""visual"" version of the story; in other words, it serves almost as a companion piece to the book. It being filmed on video intensifies the bleak reality of the situation and time, almost giving it a ""live"" aspect that would have been lost on film. Meg Foster is everything Hester Prynne should be, strong, intelligent, dignified and proud, yet passionate, sensible and utterly independent. There could have been slightly more differentiation between Kevin Conway's early vs. later Chillingworth (I would have liked to see the character more ""eaten up"" by his own evil in the end scenes), but he plays the unsympathetic role with a good deal of insight and individual touches; his eyes are especially expressive of his true thoughts. The most difficult role of all is Arthur Dimmesdale, as he could easily come across as a whiny, petulant idiot, but John Heard conveys a tortured, inner intensity that makes the Reverend's dilemma's vastly believable. You REALLY believe he is tormented by his guilt-ridden agony, and his final breakdown on the scaffold is overwhelmingly powerful, and packs an emotional wallop. The three young actresses (including the baby!) who play Pearl are amazingly believable and the director, Rick Hauser, is to be commended for handling them so as to come across as truly into their characters and not as a series of bratty, precocious turns that often distinguish children's appearances in movies. All of the supporting players do their bit to serve the drama, especially the actors portraying the Bellingham, Mistress Hibbins and John Wilson. Costumes and sets are, to use the word again, believable and completely abet the action, locale and characters. The other aspect to this presentation, what was originally a four-part series, is how unhurriedly the story is laid out. Those used to long novels that are filmed and crammed into a 2 hour time slot may be conditioned into thinking that the pace is too slow, but to me, it is a relief for once to see something score its points by taking time to play out all the subtleties and nuances of the story, which, again, played a significant part in its unerring realism. Strongly, unhesitatingly recommended.",1111881600,131,2478,5.046341463414634
954731,5,630504886X,"The movie was very good. It really brought the story to life. I do recommend reading the book first and then watching the movie. The wording in the movie is almost identical to the book, and is a good way for those who have trouble understanding the book to know this wonderful story. Just a note though - the movie is very long. Be prepared to watch it in a couple of sittings.",1104451200,8,378,4.191780821917808
954732,5,630504886X,"I am elated that this PBS production of the Scarlet Letter (1979) has received DVD treatment. John Heard deals superbly with the dichotomies and private tortures of Dimmesdale. John Heard is not only physically gorgeous (helping us understand Hester's ""fall""), but he seems more than able to effortlessly manipulate the shame-filled, weak, and complex character of Dimmesdale. Meg Foster is the quintessential Hester Prynne. She is fully equipped to portray Hester as both a feminist and a desperate mother to Pearl.

The DVD also contains behind the scenes footage.

This is the most accurate, deftly-acted version of America's first classic novel. I highly recommend purchasing this DVD. You will not be disappointed. Instead, you will be provoked to question spirituality, redemption, gender roles, America's puritanical history, etc. This production is a terrific companion to the book in a classroom setting, and it stands alone as a faithful film version of the spectacular novel. It is well worth the money and your time!!!!!!!!!!

(Please don't bother with the 1995 Demi Moore version of ""The Scarlet Letter"", as it massacres the actual plot (the only similarity to the novel is the scarlet ""A"" on Hester's chest). It got lost somewhere between One Life to Live and softcore Cinemax sexuality - an utter waste of time.)",1069977600,71,1327,5.220657276995305

954736,5,630504886X,"I saw this series when it first premiered with much fanfare on PBS in the Boston area 20 years ago.  I was in my early teens, but the story moved me and has endured as a favorite.  I was delighted to see that this version had finally come to video a few years ago, and was as beautiful as I remembered.  I get so much more out of the dialogue now, and although the effects are as cheesy as you might expect from a PBS miniseries from over 20 years ago, the music is still affecting, and the performances excellent.  It's gorgeously filmed in and around New England, and the ""making of"" shorts included on the video are a nice touch.  As I recall, the story is very close to the original -- a notable difference being the color of Hester Prynne's eyes, which were black in the story, but are light blue in this version.  I mention this because Meg Foster's eyes stand out to give her an other-worldly look which is very effective.  This miniseries is way up there on my must-see list!",985478400,11,983,4.281081081081081

And I can't get enough of watching the build up between Arthur and Hester. John Heard - I cannot say enough about him. He is absolutely dedicated and passionate about his innocent and boyish love for Hester. And there's nothing lurid or physical about it actually; it more surpasses any kind of true love I've seen shown in movies and TV. The final moment where he does profess his true self to her and everyone else, goes beyond any kind of internal turmoil that a lot of male characters demonstrate. Jeremy Irons I always thought was the King at hiding tormented, forbidden love with the characters he choses. If you can believe it, John Heard wins that in a long shot. It's beyond the usual commercially hot heavy relationships in films. It's just...real, and a lovely calm intensity always, from him.",1501632000,3,956,4.563953488372093
