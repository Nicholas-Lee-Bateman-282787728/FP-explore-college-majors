8337199,5,B001R23G6A,"With the elegance and refinement of a mad man, Dick Surface, has his opinions. Though it's very likely you'll disagree with the words that seemingly fly indiscriminately from his mouth, his outlook on life, beliefs, and thoughts are nothing short of flat out honesty. He's a self proclaimed skirt chaser, a drinker, and foul mouthed. He has no issues with using outdated racial slurs, admitting past infidelity or regaling listeners with tales of debauchery. Despite his apparent political incorrectness, get to know Dick Surface and you'll hang on his every word as his stories sound like future Hollywood screen plays. Armed with knowledge that every fiber of your being should loathe this aging man for his shortcomings, be advised -- You may just end up liking him.

""Gramps: Beneath the Surface"" is a documentary almost in a category all by itself. It's a account of a man in Dick Surface that has lived such a full life that he has stories more outrageous than a group of 10 certifiable men (and certainly enough to craft another film). The brain child of Max Koch along with partner Adam Sholder, ""Gramps"" explores the life of Dick while also detailing the connection he's formed with a man in Max to whom he has no blood relation.

Between the brawls and booze, the tears and honesty, Dick Surface is the subject that documentary movies are designed to exhibit. We crave frankness and bluntness and we love unbelievable accounts of excessive indulgence. Dick brings all of that with him in every conversation he has. By the time ""Gramps"" has ended, you're tempted to look up his address at his home in California City, just to hear more from him.",1288483200,,1654,4.820422535211268
8337200,5,B001R23G6A,"Bought this DVD the first day available strictly from the promos Max did on his facebook page.  It is stunning.

Max Koch and Dick Surface lay it all out there.  Not since ""Crumb"" have I seen a doc so honest, unblinking and powerful.

It doesn't matter if you know Dick or Max, only that you understand family, obligation, loss and redemption.

Take it from a doc snob.  This is a must see!",1265587200,,390,4.347222222222222
8337201,5,B001R23G6A,"And Max Koch and Adam Sholder know how to make one, even without a big budget. Very entertaining film. Both hilarious and touching. Lots of  Koch's illustrations to enjoy. And if that's not enough, the DVD
also includes a ridiculous commentary track- hard laugh guaranteed.
Haven't seen such an original doc in a while! I'd highly recommend this one to everyone that knows who Max Koch, and Adam Sholder are (major talents these 2 gents). It's time to find out about Dick Surface (the man is hilarious), and about Max himself, too.
Now let's wait for more stuff from Bowler Hat Productions. 5 stars!",1238112000,,599,4.759615384615385
8337202,5,B001R23G6A,"From the chillingly illustrated opening credits to the big musical finale, I couldn't remove my eyeballs from my TV even if a horde of zombie dinosaurs were destroying my town. Wait, there was no musical finale, but there was an interesting old fella talking about stuff. Never has a lovable bigot been funnier since Archie Bunker.

Definitely worth checking out if you have any soul at all. Buy 10 copies and pass them out to random people and:

1.)Whisper very gently in their ear ""Hey, watch this lovely documentary, Casandra."" Even if their name isn't Casandra.
2.)Give them a wet smooch on the forehead ever so gingerly.
3.)Look deep into their eyes for a good 5 minutes without blinking to proclaim your dominance.
4.)Skip away to wherever it is you need to be, maybe stop by the juice bar and get yourself a juice box. Fruit punch, perhaps?
5.)Give this DVD a 5 star rating as I have just done.",1237939200,,901,4.625
8337203,4,B001R23G6A,"Growing up without a dad then with an abusive stepdad can drive any young man to any number of outlets. Fortunately for us, Max Koch chose creative ones, including filmmaking -- specifically, this documentary. In it, Koch ostensibly searches for some kind of paternal connection with his grandmother's second husband, Dick Surface, a hard-drinking retiree living in the desert outside L.A. Surface, a hybrid of Ralph Kramden and Archie Bunker with a dash of redneck, happily -- and fearlessly -- obliges Max's every question during a drunken weekend at Surface's house. In addition to revealing a few whoppers that Max never knew, Surface shows us to be a ""dying breed"" of tough guy, a Bukowski without the poems; a man who can brag about his days as a cock-hound (or is it ""pussy-hound""?), laugh about near-death bar fights, yet tear up discussing his granddaughter, the only person in the family that nothing bad has happened to. (And his artistic analysis of his frog-and-golf-ball statuette is only priceless.)

Koch serves up one of his other creative talents: illustrating. His gothic renderings, Adam Sholder's effortless camerawork, and several evocative original songs by a number of artists are all standouts -- which, in the hands of Sholder's skillful editing, fill out what would have been little more than a patchwork of interview footage in the hands of less-skilled storytellers. But while Koch's deconstruction of his grandfather gives the film its depth, Koch is often quick to put the ""fun"" in ""profundity."" He detaches from his involvement in the subject matter often enough to engage his twisted, highly irreverent sense of humor without making a joke out of the journey. The commentary track removes him a further degree; he and Sholder, who complements Koch's dark wit with the ease only a longtime friend and colleague can possess, revel in machine-gun-fire wisecrackery from beginning to end. Future docu-portraits from these two -- particularly of famous figures -- would be most welcome.",1236124800,,2014,5.177914110429448
8337204,4,B001R23G6A,"A truly ambitious attempt to expose a real character of a man for what he is--gruff and opinionated, but ultimately like-able. Not quite a documentary, the ""interviews"" play-out authentically (we feel as though we are part of the family), with unusual art and outstanding music throughout. I defy anyone to watch and NOT be curious about whatever the next creative project might be from Bowler Hat.",1233878400,,398,5.045454545454546
