It will be a limited release of 3000 copies only. Check out SCREEN ARCHIVES ENTERTAINMENT website for more info.",1293494400,22,225,4.65
2765173,5,B000NDI4WA,"I grew up in the 50's and enjoyed the movies.  Not like the blow em up blood letting garbage now.  The bold colors, and clean theme of the movie was very calming.  You could go to a movie and absorb the wonderful concept of the film.  Please release this movie as soon as you can.",1291680000,9,280,4.036363636363636

2765175,5,B000NDI4WA,"Just to assure you that I too agree with all those waiting and now it's 2010!  I just added ""April Love"" to my Ipod.  And if that doesnt' indicate this film stands the test of time and the interest continues since 1957, I don't know what would.  It's well past time - please release it!",1275177600,11,286,4.163636363636364
2765176,5,B000NDI4WA,"""April Love"" was a smash success. I was there as were many of you reading this...otherwise you wouldn't bother with reviews of films not yet available on DVD. Wake up 20th Century Fox! Give us a blu-ray release in fabulous CinemaScope and 4-track Stereophonic sound just as it was released in 1957. We've grown up, have projection systems in our homes with multi-channel theater sound to experience gems you produced at the beginning of the wide-screen, stereophonic sound era. Get with it! We want ""April Love"" and an uncut version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with all the original music that was cut after it's premiere. We're waiting!",1268092800,9,649,4.8558558558558556
2765177,5,B000NDI4WA,"April Love was a fantastic movie for both Pat Boone and Shirley Jones, who both sing absolutely wonderful.  As much as I loved Elvis among other great singers, why is it most (if not all) of his movies have been released and only a few for Pat Boone or Shirley Jones.  April Love should have been released a long time before now for dvd purchase, along with Bernadine.  What the heck is the problem?  Who is not paying attention to the desires of the public?  Somebody out there give us a break!  You never even see them on tv!  Get moving and make them available now if not yesterday.",1255219200,80,585,4.3119266055045875

2765180,5,B000NDI4WA,"What is the problem for the delay in releasing a 20TH CENTURY FOX PAT BOONE COLLECTION: BERNADINE, APRIL LOVE, MARDI GRAS, ALL HANDS ON DECK please???

Ninety nine percent of Elvis' films are available and much enjoyed.

However, and whilst JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH and the SIXTIES' remake of STATE FAIR are already available, Mr Boone's own popularity with older film fans in respect of the four additional titles deserves stronger respect than his former Studio appears to give him.

Well overdue for a DVD release FOX Archivists, so please give us a happy and well appreciated surprise!

Here's hoping anyway.",1217030400,56,622,4.951923076923077

2765245,5,B000NDI4WA,"This Blu-ray copy of April Love is excellent in visuals and sound.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes this movie.  I love this movie.  Is it Hokum and syrupy?  Well, maybe.  Pat Boone isn't James Dean and he isn't a rebel without a cause, but I remember times like this.  I remember that not all teenage troubles are fraught with gut-wrenching drama.
There is a sweetness here that speaks of warm summer nights and fireflies and barbecues, and girls and boys, and even the fun girls and boys can have.  I will admit that this is a rather squeaky-clean tale.  Pat Boone was even asked by his wife to ""not"" kiss Shirley Jones.

Btw, I think Rebel Without a Cause is also a great film.  But my memory of youth was closer to April Love than that great Nicholas Ray directed classic.",1440028800,4,786,4.395833333333333

2765247,5,B000NDI4WA,"Oh wow, what to say about two of Americas' all-time great actor/singers.  This is a feel-good movie with fun songs and beautiful horse country visuals.  The plot is not deep on the surface, but sending your troubled son from Chicago influences to the Deep South to soak up a more relaxed and perhaps a little more moral atmosphere, has its merits.  Meeting country Aunt and Uncle who lost their only son in WW2, and also harbor bitter issues from their son's loss, would be just the mutual tonic to have all parties mature and grow into better people.  Shirley Jones Southern Belle simple on the outside but roaring Tiger on the inside persona is fun to watch develop as she plays second fiddle to her seemingly more sophisticated sister and of course she gets the boy at the State Fair in the end.

This will not be an earth shattering viewing but it is an hour or so escape to fun music and pretty horse country antics.  Also, your only opportunity to see Boone and Jones singing and driving sulkys together in their prime-very nice combination of April Love.",1439856000,5,1061,4.587301587301587

For the people who have been waiting  for a high quality release of this film, here it is. Who ever was in charge of restoring this fun film deserves a pat on the back.  Colors and definition are amazing and yes its letterboxed with the ratio 2 35:1. Extras include a commentary track with Shirley Jones and the theatrical trailer. This disc is part of a limited edition of 3000 so I would advise you get it while you can.

2765269,2,B000NDI4WA,"I would have bought this lovely film if it had been done in the correct ratio. Here in the UK I have had the TV recording which  was shown many many years ago. Shown in wide screen before digital TV  it wasn't that good, but better than nothing. Screen Archives, a couple of years ago stated it would be in a future issue on B/R. It was eventually cancelled, probably because Fox decided to issue their MOD' s and April Love was one of the included. Last year, Screen Archives stated it would again issue it in B/R. What a dreadful wait till last week when it finally came through the door. Playing it on a 60inch screen it was a beautiful fine grained print and an excellent 20th Century Fox sound. Extras are Isolated score trailer and Commentary.
It' s a shame this is a limited issue and only in B/R which Fox should have done themselves.
This is one of my high points as a collector, getting this issue.
As Thomas Dittmer's review says, buy this issue while you can, Like Screen Archives issue of Mysterious Island in B/R. I regret waiting a little too long and it disappeared.

Come on Fox, please change your policy issuing these 2.35 films in 4.3 MOD issues.",1430784000,,1166,4.388888888888889

2765271,1,B000NDI4WA,This review is for the terrible pan scan print used for the MOD. It is a shame that the inventor of Cinemascope (20th Century Fox) was not willing to use a Cinemascope print for the MOD. Such a popular movie filmed in Cinemascope and now released on DVD R in pan scan only. This is a waste of money. But there are very good news since the film is just released on BluRay by the small label Twilight Time. It is expensive but if you are a real fan of the movie in its original widescreen format buy the new BluRay. Sound and picture are both very good and far better than the Fox Cinema Archives MOD. So try to get the widescreen BluRay before it is sold out because it is a limited edition of 3000 pieces only.,1429747200,2,710,4.115107913669065

2765423,4,B000NDI4WA,"""April Love"" from 1957 was not a critical success upon release, but now, despite the furor of reviewers angry about 20th Century-Fox Cinema Archives stupidity for putting these titles out in antique pan and scan, it can be appreciated anew as a near classic.  It has some very good vibes, itself a remake of ""Home in Indiana"" with songs by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster and directed admirably by Henry Levin.  Once again, Pat Boone is asked to play a bit of a bad boy, against a perhaps unnatural struggle (he refused to kiss co-star Shirley Jones for religious reasons or for Mrs. Boone's sake, and the director and studio just decided to keep up with the controversy and Pat, of course, does no beefcake down on the farm and the film ends very unsatisfyingly without a screen kiss at the end).  Of course, the next year for his more insipid musical, ""Mardi Gras"" also for 20th (songs also by Fain and Webster), Pat does both beefcake and kiss and continued to do so to greater and greater degree until his box office waned.  Of course, this was all the more strangely uncomfortable for Mr. Boone.  It's almost a sin to see Shirley Jones nearly begging to be kissed and touched and the refrain nearly ruins her performance.  It must have been hard to work with him, it's so unnatural.  But, as fate would have it, Ms. Jones won an Oscar a few years later for playing a prostitute in ""Elmer Gantry"" opposite Burt Lancaster, who was rumored to enjoy homosexuality at times in his career.  ""April Love"" was originally filmed in Cinemascope and Color by Deluxe, but is presented here in full screen.",1380326400,3,1602,4.5964912280701755
2765424,1,B000NDI4WA,"Thankfully, new technologies have brought in their wake a universal availability of wide screen TV sets. This has been great news for those of us who grew up in the 1950s when 20th Century Fox led the charge against the limitations of ""the box"" from 1953, when The Robe, the first Cinemasope picture, was released. After some initial awkwardness in composing for the new ratios,  many of the screen's greatest directors turned to its teeming visual possibilities and brought a level of artistry throughout the decade that gave the big screen a cutting edge and allowed some of the world's greatest directors and cameramen to strut their artistry in the new formats, among them Vincente Minnelli, Nicholas Ray, Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Otto Preminger, Douglas Sirk, Stanley Donen, John Ford, Samuel Fuller, Akira Kurosawa, Max Ophuls, Elia Kazan and many more such luminaries. Paramount's widescreen process, VistaVision, provided a clarity and beauty of film image that has never been bettered on the screen. In this day and age of Blu-ray and High Definition and home theatre, we've come to expect the very best in home screen presentation. Most DVD/Blu-ray outlets are ahead of the game, which makes Fox's DVD on demand line all the more conspicuously ancient looking in terms of their product, which retails at top dollar. Especially outrageous is their completely cynical refusal to issue the 50s and 60s Fox films in their correct aspect ratios. Given that many of these films have great historical significance as being pioneering widescreen films (Fox patented Cinemascope and released all their films after The Robe in that process!!) I'm flabbergasted they are mostly being released in 4:3 ratios pan and scan. I had so looked forward to finally seeing and owning Cinemascope versions of April Love, the two Smiley films, and many other titles too numerous to mention from that extraordinary period.

2765427,1,B000NDI4WA,"I'm not going to offer a full review of April Love.  I've seen this fun easy going movie many times over the years.  If you're here, chances are you already have formed an opinion of April Love which is what brought you here in the first place.

In fact, I had looked forward to seeing it in it's entire wide screen Cinemascope Technicolor glory, the modern day wide screen format that Fox practically invented when it finally did get a DVD release.  Unfortunately, Fox continues to show it has little regard for much of it's own film archives, less regards for many of the stars who helped it become what it is today, and thinks so little of their customers that they only view them as numbers on a calculator.

The truth is if you want this version of April Love, you can acquire it for free.  It shows up on the Fox Movie Channel consistently, and recently showed up on Turner Classic Movies with very little fanfare.  It's understandable as to why.

The print Fox sent tor TCM, who pride themselves in broadcasting films in their natural format, was the same terrible pan and scan version that you've seen on Fox Movie Channel and that showed up on Netflix for the past not too long ago.  I don' believe the people at TCM  were happy about the product, so they ran the film late with no introduction or no wrap up at the end despite it being a new presentation on that network.  When your viewers have come to expect the best presentation possible, showing a Cinemascope film in pan and scan had to be an embarrassment.

So you just as well go ahead and record the same awful formatted blurry translation because for the premium price here, the presentation will be no better. With a little research, burning a DVD from the broadcast medium isn't that difficult, or look around for somebody to do it for you instead of becoming the low brow customer that Fox believes you must be.

The only thing worse is Fox's continual flimsy excuse making as to how many of their CinemaScope  films ended up scanned for a broadcast medium that is not only fading fast, but on the very verge of extinction, and that they are shoving out in their Cinema Archive series.

At some point in the past, Unlike Warner and other studios who were thinking ahead and not backwards, someone at Fox decided in their infinite wisdom. that they were going to do pan and scan masters of much of their library instead of doing wide screen anamorphic conversions.

You can almost pinpoint this decision back to the time when films like this one that used to get Wide Screen Showings on the Fox Movie Channel, suddenly only appeared in a choppity chopped version such as the one Fox graces us with here.  Somebody at Fox made a critical error in judgment, but instead of correcting that mistake and looking forward to the future, Fox has decided that it ""would be cost prohibitive"" now to re-scan these films and make them available to be seen the way they were meant to.  In other words, buy these terrible presentations now because we're not about to admit that our vision in the future was sorely lacking, and that hey have no respect for their own films beyond punching up some numbers on a calculator. And if it was lacking back then, it's not much better now.

Apparently whoever made this backwards thinking decision was under the mistaken impression that every film collector, moviegoer, and film buff was a total doofus, who was sitting at home watching movies on 19 inch portables in their strato-lounger with a beer gut and a six pack. In other words, the effort to educate people on why wide screen was better, the many advertisements asking to donate to Film Preservation doesn't mean a lot to Fox until it comes time to release Sound of Music for whatever umpteenth anniversary it happens to be this year.  Not that I have anything against that film.  I own the DVD and the Blu-ray.  But shouldn't you be thinking beyond re-release after re-release of the same old same old?

And having made that decision, these Cinemascope films were relegated back to the vault, never to be seen again in the manner in which they were filmed or meant to be viewed and because of Fox's lack of vision, they will never be seen in their natural format again.

Included in these films were the Pat Boone films, Bernadine, April Love, and All Hands On Deck.  Luckily, Fox did do a wide screen scan for State Fair, so they could include it as an extra along with the 1945 version. It even comes with an audio commentary by Pat Boone.

But mysteriously, they hardly mentioned it when advertising the DVD which caused many to be not only grateful, but completely taken by surprise to see it's inclusion  in the set.  You would have thought that at some point someone at Fox would have thought, ""We have all these Pat Boone Films, why don't we release a box set, while at the same time making the films available.  Maybe some executive is still peeved because Pat wouldn't kiss Shirley on the Ferris Wheel.  Could be, you know because since the Boone version of State Fair with such nobodies as Tom Ewell, Ann Margaret, Bobby Darin, and Alice Faye was never given it's own seperate release or a chance at life on its own legs.

They also did a later wide screen scan of Journney to the Center of the Earth before turning that film over to Twilight Time for release on blu-ray because ""Gee, there's no audience for those types of film in that format.""  I guess that's why Twilight Time sold out of the $29.99 blu-ray discs and you can now have one for the low low price of just $100 on Amazon if you purchase from an outside seller.  No audience, right Fox?

And now after seeing Warner's archive become such a huge success, and the product from other studios do so as well, Fox, being late to the party as always, decides it wants to have a piece of that action.  But unlike Warner, who brings the best quality scans possible, Fox believes they can catch up with inferior transfers of some movies (Bird of Paradise), and slapping some old pan and scans (April Love, All Hands on Deck, Mardi Gras, Goodbye Charlie, etc.), on the disc and folks will be satisfied. Sorry Fox, but in this day and age of Wide Screen high-def Televisions, you're decision you made years ago to stick with pan and scan transfers made for your cable channel just doesn't cut it.  You're a discredit to film, moviegoers, and the film industry in general.

When I asked a Fox representative about this, I got the usual stock answer, most of which I've already answered above:

Many of those titles only have pan and scan masters and it would be cost prohibitive to create theatrical aspect ratio masters. We use the best that is available, and instead of not making them available to the public, the MOD program allows for these films to be seen. We have begun to include the aspect ratio information to each titles sell page on sites like Amazon, to ensure consumers are aware before purchasing.

So to sum it up, they only have Pan and Scan masters because somebody in control at Fox was looking backward, instead of thinking ahead.  They also had little regard many of the films in their archive, and preserving it for viewing in it's natural state.  And rather then make that library available and to preserve it's own history, we are going to give you a DVD that was made for a medium that will soon no longer exist.  Why?  Becuase they believe you don't know any better and will just accept a shoddy inferior product.

My answer is, I already own this shoddy inferior product when I recorded it off of TV many years ago. I've spent many dollars at the Warner Archives, have bought many of the Universal Archived Films that Amazon offers here, several Twilight Time and Olive Film Blu-ray releases as well.  So no matter how much I may love this movie, or any other Fox releases on the cheap, they won't be getting my money until they hire somebody who understands what being a true film fan is all about and can look a little bit beyond his calculator he probably bought from Texas Instruments back in the 80's. I think he needs a new slide rule and abacus.",1378252800,9,8100,4.525377229080933
2765428,4,B000NDI4WA,"My girlfriend endured half an hour of APRIL LOVE before she scowled, pronounced it too bland and chaste, and then went off somewhere, maybe to watch Miley Cyrus twerk. Me, I sank deeper into the couch and soaked in the vision of a young, very beautiful Shirley Jones. Also, Pat Boone is in this movie.

Pat Boone plays Chicago bad boy, Nick Conover, whom the lenient judge exiles to rural Kentucky to stay at his Uncle Jed Bruce's farm. Nick Conover is guilty of ""malicious mischief,"" which is code for stealing a car and drag racing all over town. In Kentucky he's still very much on probation, his driver's license suspended. Nick and his uncle (Arthur O'Connell) get off to a rocky start, what with the uncle's gruff exterior clashing with the kid's seething resentment.

Luckily, Liz Templeton (Shirley Jones) rides in to provide a welcome distraction. Liz's family owns the neighboring horse farm. Thru Liz, Nick meets her more refined older sister Fran (Dolores Michaels) and he's infatuated now. This ticks off Liz because she's developed a crush on Nick. Liz is gorgeous and really nice, but she's such a tomboy.

For the trivia-mongers, APRIL LOVE (1957) is a musical reboot of HOME IN INDIANA (1944). It finds the wholesome Pat Boone striving to project an edgier persona, but not so edgy that it rips you out of that movie musical mood. Boone has a singing voice so velvety and soothing that silk and white noise are, respectively, impressed. The girls may swoon or fan their bosoms when he sings, but his calm musicality doesn't exactly translate to rabid delinquent youth. Still, there are moments when he's pretty convincing when throwing a snit.

Banned from driving automobiles, Nick indulges his gearhead jones by tinkering on a stubborn farm tractor and a broke-down jalopy. A major arc concerns Nick's gradually warming up to the notion of sulky horseracing, this being one way to gratify his need for speed and also the impetus for truce between him and his uncle. For the uninitiated, sulky horseracing isn't racing on horses while you're in a pissy mood. A sulky is a light two-wheeled cart that carries the driver and is pulled by the horse, so think of it as mini-chariot races. Anyway, the movie climaxes at the Bentonville Fair, site of the big race and also of Pat Boone and Shirley Jones' almost-kiss at the Ferris wheel. Word has it that Boone had refused to do the kissing scene, citing religious reasons. However, many years later, it was revealed that, apparently, he just didn't want to make his wife uncomfortable. He actually finally did get approval from his wife to do the kissing scene, but by that point there'd been so much outpouring of support for his religious stand that he then felt he couldn't back down. Not that I'm judging, but, man, to refuse to plant one on someone so beautiful as Shirley Jones, well, dang it, I AM judging Pat Boone a little. So how was the kissing dilemma resolved? You'd have to tune in.

As for the 23-year-old Shirley Jones, at this juncture in her career, she was sort of feeling how Dick Powell had felt in the late 1930s, typecast as a musical star and unable to land the meatier dramatic parts. No worries, though, three years later, she'd end up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her bit in ELMER GANTRY (1960). Meanwhile, as ""Liz Templeton,"" she embodies that fresh, next-door-neighboor girl that you just can't help but fall in love with. And, no surprise, she sings beautifully.

APRIL LOVE made a lot of money for 20th Century Fox, but the critics were more reserved in their support than the movie audiences were. Oh, critics... Me, I always get a nostalgic burn when this movie goes on the air. The storyline isn't about to stun you with wicked plot swerves. But the songs are nice, Boone and Jones are very watchable, and there's a warm, uncomplicated vibe to the film. If you're hankering for a slice of Americana, this'll do ya. But can I say this? In the skills exhibition scene that culminates with Boone singing the title song, a matronly lady plays the trombone and an old gent does a bit of hoofing. I found them even more entertaining than Boone's warbling. It's not a knock on Boone. It's how unexpectedly good those two extras are.",1377993600,2,4251,4.722371967654986

I was already a fan of Shirley Jones and like Pat Boone's music so it didn't take much persuasion to watch the movie.  I don't really remember much about the movie except that I did enjoy the movie.  The reason, I believe, more of these older films are slow to be released is because the studios are now full of young, stupid people who don't know what good movies and music are.  They were never exposed to good music and movies and they can't relate to them so they have no interest in putting them out on dvd.  All they care about is modern films, which they think will sell volumes and they do not realize there is a large audience who are begging to buy these older films and hence, the studio will make a bunch of money.

2765452,5,B000NDI4WA,"NOTE: The recent DVD release of this move is in the 4:3 TV format, not the original 2.35:1 theatrical release. While this is a wonderful movie (as I discuss below in my review from before this release), I also MUCH prefer when studios give us a wide screen release. Why the heck do they think so many of us went out and got wide screen HD/theater aspect TVs?!?

In 1957 this was a 35mm Cinemascope presentation with 4 track stereo. In other words it received the royal treatment, and it would be great if we could still see it like that.

The music and story are great either way, but instead of buying a 4:3 version of the movie, I'd recommend keeping an eye out for the next time TCM runs it, and they seem to do so most years. (Although with the launch of the Fox Movie Channel it might show up there in the future rather than on TCM).

Now, back to the original review:

In ""April Love"", Pat Boone plays a juvenile delinquent (LOL WAY against type, huh?) who is sent to his uncle's farm in the country to get him away from bad influences. There he meets a pair of sisters (one played by Shirley Jones) whose father owns a large stable for trotters. The uncle used to run such an operation, but let his business and his life run down after the death of his son in the Korean War.

The movie is filled with delightful slice of life moments, as well as the entertaining and uplifting story of Pat Boone's character growing up through his association with the one trotter his uncle has left. The movie is a pleasant journey through the summer of the young group of friends. Crises are on the small and quickly resolved side, and the major crisis is very amusingly resolved through a display of spunk.

Pat and Shirley both sing, which makes the movie a pleasure all by itself. The title song, ""April Love"", was a big hit for Boone in the 50s. This is the kind of movie were you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the very pleasant relationships and story. Highly recommended.",1296777600,33,1976,4.355978260869565

It is a heartwarming film that will give you some chuckles and also bring a tear to your eye.  Sure wish whomever is holding it up would get it together.",1296777600,26,579,4.043859649122807
