I don't remember which one came first, but there was ""American Ninja"" (and its sequels), ""The Octagon,"" and all those Sho Kosugi movies, plus that Lee Van Cleef TV show 'Ninja Master'... And that's not to mention all those crazy-awful-hiLARious Godfrey Ho Hong Kong patchwork movies...anyway, it seemed like they were everywhere, right?

Well, apparently it took a little bit longer for this mania to filter down south of the border (no judgment, amigos), but by the late '80s, early '90s you started seeing MEXICAN ninja movies, which is a peculiar subgenre all its own (kind of like, for example, Redneck Noir). ""Justiciero callejero"" ('Vigilante Street') is a prime example of this obscure category of exploitation filmmaking.

In the broad strokes, it's basically just another ""Death Wish"" variant, with a straitlaced, hardworking, average guy hero (he runs an electronics repair shop) who is victimized by street thugs - in this case they rape his girlfriend (or is it his sister? I was a little unclear on that point - my Spanish is weak) and kidnap her little girl. In addition they do a LOT of other crimes against various anonymous civilians. So, what's good guy Leonardo Daniel to do? Go become a ninja vigilante - of course!

And not just any ninja vigilante, but one who wears a ninja suit of jungle camouflage (how, exactly, this is in any way advantageous in an urban setting is never made clear) and who seems to appear almost magically wherever crimes are being committed to soundly thump the hinders of the evildoers. Just like Superman! Superninja?

Oh, and speaking of criminals, apparently in this guy's neighborhood there are only THREE of them - that's it. And they seem to commit ALL of the crimes. But they do have a boss in the person of baldheaded, paunchy, middleaged Sergio Bustamante, who just happens to be...wait for it...an evil master ninja! Betcha didn't see that one coming.

The film also includes an egregious prevalence (even by early '90s Mexican standards) of mullets, acid-washed jeans and sleeveless t-shirts (for the guys), not to mention aerobics wear, hair teased to the limit of physics and lotsa eye makeup (for the gals). There are also masked wrestlers (but of course!), multiple rapes and attempted rapes, and Lorena Herrera's briefly exposed boobs (during one of those attempted rapes). Yeehaw!

Yup, this one's pretty much got it all. If only there'd been a BMX bike chase in there somewhere...",1423180800,,2547,4.953161592505855
