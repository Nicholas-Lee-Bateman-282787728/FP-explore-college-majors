So happy we found them at Amazon-have bought a bunch!",1315526400,,258,4.51063829787234
7871740,5,6304417292,"Hercules (played by Wishbone) is on a mission. He needs to bring three golden apples to the King if he is to have his daughter. But he has to get past the Hesperides and the dragon guarding the Hesperides if he wants the apples. Two other similar stories are happening in Oakdale as well. Samantha's dad is turning forty and she has no idea what to get him. Until that is, her dad mentions a picture of him and Joe's dad on a fishing trip. Now, Samantha is on a search to find that picture. Wishbone's got a problem as well. Wishbone received a bone for his birthday only to be snatched away by a Doberman. Wishbone will do anything to get his beloved bone back.

There is an interesting extra called ""Feed the Dog"" which is humorously narrated by Wishbone. Well overall there are three missions you might say. Hercules mission to get the golden apples, Samantha's mission to find the perfect present and Wishbones mission to get his bone back.

This is a great purchase especially because of the ""Feed the Dog"" extra. You need to add this episode to your Wishbone collection.",1251244800,2,1076,4.512820512820513
