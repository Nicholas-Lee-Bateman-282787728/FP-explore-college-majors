7846023,4,6303409903,"In this movie Jack has gone back to San Francisco and his friend Henry is mining his claim and caring for White Fang.
This story is mixed with Native American spiritualality and mysticism.  They are in need of the white wolf (White Fang, or is it Henry?) to lead them to the caribou they are in need of to prevent starvation among their people.
This sequel is very entertaining with beautiful scenery.
A great family film.",1046563200,8,422,4.552631578947368
7846024,3,6303409903,"I've read White fang and there is no mention of Myth of a White Wolf.  Disney had to have a sequel, so they made up this story.",1043193600,3,127,3.7037037037037037
7846025,5,6303409903,"I have watched this movie a number of times and still find the story to be interesting. The simplicity and predictability of this movie makes it a great movie for younger elementary children, but there is enough plot and action to keep the family entertained. I enjoy the Alaskan setting and the images of the Haida village. There is a love story woven in with the young hero's role of finding the caribou and saving the village, but neither plot goes into anything overly sentimental or complicated.
I have used this movie in a fourth grade classroom to have them identify the main characters, the setting, the problem(plot), and the solution: things that are found in any good story, be it written or in a movie. They enjoyed the movie and it worked well for the assignment. This is a great family movie because it contains these basic story elements and does it well, making it watchable again and again.",1025827200,16,907,4.675
