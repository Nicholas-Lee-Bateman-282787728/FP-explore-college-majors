However, sports in gym aren't always easy to learn since in that setting children are at all different levels of comprehension.  This dvd gives kids an introduction to several sports so that by the time they get there they have an understanding of the fundamentals and can feel comfortable taking the lead in a group setting!  Give your kids early confidence in sports that can lead to confidence in other parts of their life later on!",1301961600,,556,4.653061224489796

Every time I put it in the DVD player; you can tell he is like a sponge- soaking it in like crazy.  So glad I found this.  Just wish there were sequels! Ha!",1301097600,,274,3.8392857142857144
8391339,5,B0038K2R78,"What a great inspiration! My kids just love to pretend, and mimic the monkey when they watch this video. This will definitely make them want to go out and play sports, and not just sit inside playing video games. What a great concept. Thank you!",1268006400,,245,4.466666666666667
8391340,5,B0038K2R78,"My two boys, 3 1/2 years and 9 months, love this video! Since we have had this video, I have had a request everyday from my oldest son to watch ""the monkey movie"".  He loves to imitate the sports moves, stretch with Emekei and sing along to the music. Our youngest son equally enjoys it and is mesmerized by the balls bouncing by and the upbeat music. We have many children's videos and this is at the top of our favorites list!",1267574400,,428,4.219512195121951
8391341,5,B0038K2R78,All the friends kids we have shown it too really enjoy the monkey and seeing the movement of the players and the gear.  they can copy with their pretend equipment for now and mimic the pros on the dvd...  real nice,1267315200,,214,4.195121951219512
8391342,5,B0038K2R78,"This is the best video...my 4 1/2 year old son and 2 1/2 year old daughter want to watch it over and over again!  They have learned so much from it.  We are surprised when they initiate a sport such as soccer and imitate the ""drills"" that they saw on the movie.  We asked my daughter where she learned to stop a soccer ball and she said ""from the monkey in the movie""!

If you want a great introduction to many sports...this is the video for you.  The kids are captivated by the animation, cute songs and sports.  Thumb up for Baby Goes Pro!!!",1266796800,2,543,4.173076923076923
