8306329,5,B001GNHNDC,"Childhood favorite of mine. Wonderful memories. In the late 50s and early 60s Mexico's Golden Cinema was in full force and they turned out Supernatural Westerns galore. El Pantano De Las Animas, literally translates to The Swamp O The Souls, literally. The hero Gaston Santos was a world famous Matador whom I met in Reynosa Tamaulipas Mexico at one of his Bullfights. The movie is fast paced, with bad guys that are really evil, plotting to cash in on insurance policies. There is also an aquatic monster (or is there), a beautiful girl in distress and a comical, cowardly, side kick. Wonderful film.",1422489600,,601,4.844660194174757
8306330,4,B001GNHNDC,"Pretty good Mexican-made, Spanish-language adventure-thriller.  Gaston Santos plays a sort of Lone Ranger type (without the mask) with a silly sidekick who goes about righting wrongs and fighting evildoers.  He even has a white horse named Rayo de Plata (Silver Ray).  El Pantano de las Animas (Swamp of the lost Monsters) is about a blind widow being beset by bad guys who want to do her out of her inheritance.  Naturally Gaston comes galloping to the rescue.  The swamp even has a monster swishing around.  A creature from the haunted lagoon that HAS to be one of the lousiest monster costumes in the universe.  Still the movie is entertaining and the JC Films DVD release is good quality and the color is very good.  Recommended.",1397865600,2,733,4.808
