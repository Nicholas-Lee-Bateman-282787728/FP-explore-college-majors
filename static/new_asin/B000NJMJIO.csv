8178515,5,B000NJMJIO,"I enjoyed this movie because it made me mad at the husband, disgusted with the family's trust and being so darn naive.",1409961600,4,118,4.409090909090909
8178516,2,B000NJMJIO,"Lucas (Gregory Harrison) inherits a summer cottage and his wife (Glynnis O'Connor) insists he take the family there for the summer. Lucas has flashbacks about the place. In route they encounter some bad men who abduct the family only to be rescued by Simon (Corin Nemec) a 19 year old boy. Daughter Haley (Natalie Shaw ) takes a shine to him.

Simon ends up staying at the cottage and creates problems. That is pretty much it, except for the twist which seasoned viewers will have figured out by the end of the first good flashback.

Made of TV boring. Lifetime fans should like it.",1397779200,2,582,4.586538461538462
8178517,4,B000NJMJIO,"I added this movie to the queue, even thou I knew nothing about it, because I love the cast. Summer of Fear is based on the novel, Simon Says, and was a TV movie, and therein lies the problem. This story is amazing and would have made a great feature film, however they had to censor it and dumb it down big time for TV. Corky Nemec and Gregory Harrison were both amazing. I've always enjoyed both of them and together they had fantastic chemistry. Summer of Fear is a very entertaining story that will throw you a few twists. Despite never reading the novel, I'm willing to bet it goes further and is more direct than the movie was. It was a great cast and I definitely enjoyed the film, but it should have been so much more.",1361577600,2,726,4.23021582733813

8178519,4,B000NJMJIO,"Summer of fear (1996) starring Gregory Harrison, Glynnis O'Connor, and Corin Nemec is a good made for TV thriller. It has quite a few corny moments but at times it really is creepy. I decided to watch this when I saw Corin Nemec was in it. I really enjoyed his performance as the mysterious drifter.

The Marshall's decided to take a vacation to a summer house that was left to them by a deceased aunt. They're carjacked on the way there and attacked by two men. A mysterious drifter, Simon, (Corin Nemec) saves them. The rest of the movie slowly builds as Mr. Marshall becomes increasingly paranoid and as Simon spends more time with the Marshall's.

This movie has a lifetime movie feel, especially the script. But in my opinion it is better. Just don't expect great acting from all of the actors or a lot of gore or violence. Recommended if you enjoy made-for-tv thrillers or are a fan of any of the actors.",1212192000,7,910,4.509090909090909
