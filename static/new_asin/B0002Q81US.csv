8030574,5,B0002Q81US,"This video is fun and very informative for children of all ages.  It discusses safety around the home, what to do if a stranger grabs you, unwanted touches and alot more!  The karate is exciting, the games and quizzes are fun, and Glenn Olson is very funny!  I highly recommend this video.",1106697600,5,289,4.519230769230769
