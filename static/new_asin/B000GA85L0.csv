8129645,5,B000GA85L0,"While watching this very memorable documentary, I was able to get a better understanding of what really happened with Columbus and De Soto. The information that I was able to take from this documentary was something that I hadn't even learned in school at all! This documentary not only informed me but also showed me what the conquistadors and Indians looked like back then and proved that mounds signify the thousands of innocent Indians that have been slaughtered, and killed! Through this documentary I learned about many different tribes Indian Nations. One of the main points that I learned though this tape that really kicked-off this major dilemma was when Columbus was given a golden tiara. He believed it was a crown and viewed this gift from the Indians as a symbol of authority. This began the Spanish War with the Indians. I would recommend this book to a friend.

Two great books to read after watching this historical documentary are ""A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose, and Thoughts for the Mind, Body, and Soul"" and ""The Glory Field.""",1151884800,,1043,4.859550561797753
8129646,5,B000GA85L0,"This excellent video narrated by Kevin Costner gives a vivid depiction of history.  The contact of Columbus and his relationship with the Native Tainos in the Caribbean was not a friendly sight to behold.  It shows what people will do for gold and how power is used to enslave others.  The video also shows how approximately 2 million Taino Indians became extinct after having contact with Columbus in 1492.  The second part of the video was about Hernando De Soto's contact with the Native Americans in Florida in 1539.  It shows the travels of De Soto from Tampa Bay to the Mississippi and what actually happened to the Native Americans who had contact with De Soto and his men.  The video shows how the use of weapons and disease destroyed many individuals.  The video is a great historical piece on the various Indian nations living back then, their location, customs, and some of their history. This video will leave you scratching your head and wondering why.  Other relaxing books to read after this video are: ""A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose and Thoughts for the Mind, Body and Soul,""  ""The language of Poetry Forms by Tree Good,"" and ""Everyday Miracles by Okubo.""",1151884800,,1168,4.7711442786069655

The combination of the sketches of the Indian people with their regalia, villages, and way of life, and the live shots of the country scenes of nature combine into a full picture of how the Indian people lived and thrived during that time.  This film starts out with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492.  The narrators inform the viewer of how the Indians lived harmoniously with other. Their kindnesses were taken as weaknesses as Columbus and deSoto tried to systematically destroy them for their jewels, gold, and pearls.  This is an excellent historical video and I recommend it to everyone.

A good book to read after viewing this historical video is ""A Trilogy of Poetry, Prose and Thoughts for the Mind, Body and Soul.""",1151884800,,902,4.8311688311688314
