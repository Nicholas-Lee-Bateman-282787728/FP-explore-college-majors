2682237,5,B000K405CY,"These movies are a excellent mock comedies of Top Gun and Rambo.  Charlie Sheen at his best, and Lloyd Bridges is brilliant.  Both these movies are quite good comedies, and I would recommend them for any fan of Airplane or Naked Gun.

2682240,5,B000K405CY,"Awesome. Not much more to say. Both Hot Shots. One DVD. Do you even really need a review? If you seen these movies, and like them both, buy this DVD. For the price, it's a steal and a half. These are 2 of the best comedys. Funny as hell, and well worth the price. Buy this DVD. Just click the button. I'm serious. If I was joking, I'd say, a horse walks into a bar, the bartender says ""Why the long face?"".",1201478400,,406,3.9634146341463414
2682241,5,B000K405CY,"This was one of the funniest movies around in the 90's, I can remember all the laughs I had in the theatre when it was on the big screen. I guarantee you even watching this today you would get more laughs than expected for this old movie double.",1196208000,,245,4.125
2682242,5,B000K405CY,I am going to make this shorter and sweeter than I usually do. I love both of these movies. Pre-Charlie Sheen crazy in real life. He and the entire cast had to have a blast doing these. I recommend these movies to be sure especially if you love off the wall comedy and sight gags. We need more movies like this that are just fun.,1502236800,,329,4.076923076923077

2682246,5,B000K405CY,"It Makes no difference how often I have seen these, I still laugh. I enjoy outrageous parodies like these. in spite of Charlie Sheen starring in them, who is definitely far from being one of my favorites. Getting past that fact, they're still enjoyable to watch.",1492905600,,262,4.717391304347826

2682248,3,B000K405CY,"I had both movies in VHS version, and it feels like a lot of scene had been cut from the DVD version (for example, the fighting scene at Thai, and when general first contact with Rambo at the temple...etc).

2682258,5,B000K405CY,Hot Shots and Hot Shots Part Deux is a satirical look at the action films. Laughable situations with people spouting patriotic movie lines throughout. The one liners are rapid fire and the action is slap stick. Full of laughs.,1468627200,,226,4.82051282051282

2682293,3,B000K405CY,"The movies weren't too bad.  Had some good satire, but if you haven't seen the movies they're spoofing, you wouldn't get the references.  I only bought them because I knew my husband liked them.  He definitely enjoyed them, so I'm happy.",1412640000,,237,4.7317073170731705

2682298,4,B000K405CY,"Slapstick stupidity at its finest. these are classic spoof comedies. Charlie Sheen is great in these movies. these aren't naked gun or airplane  quality but pretty close. A lot laughs and fun for hours. If you enjoy the scary movie series, top secret ,naked gun series, airplane etc this is right up your ally",1401667200,,309,4.722222222222222
2682299,5,B000K405CY,"This is a real value for money. I watched this show many years ago and watching again, I am still laughing at all the funnies and jokes. Charlie Sheen and Lloyd Bridges at their comical best.",1399939200,,191,4.333333333333333
2682300,5,B000K405CY,"No matter how many times I see these movies,  I never get tired of then. I have lost count of how many times I have seen these movies over the past 20 years (yes, they really are that old) but every time I watch them, I still laugh at the jokes as if it were the first time I had ever heard them.",1399075200,,296,3.6984126984126986
2682301,5,B000K405CY,"I purchased these movies a while ago because I am a huge fan of the Hot Shots! movies.  The price was very reasonable, and they arrived early.  If you're a fan of Charlie Sheen, and of slapstick movies, you have to check these out!",1389398400,,231,4.2272727272727275
2682302,5,B000K405CY,"This is a fantastic duo of movies. Very funny spoofs of action flicks like Top Gun, the Rambo series, and other war movies. Many clever jokes and sight-gags. They don't make comedies like this anymore",1388534400,,200,4.742857142857143
2682303,5,B000K405CY,Classic and a dumb funny but still funny Lloyd Bridges made this movie funny just wish he had more scenes at times.  He was a great actor.,1386633600,2,138,4.111111111111111
2682304,1,B000K405CY,"NR...what does this mean? Indeed. I buy wide range of movies but this one ended in my collection  for unknown reason. So I watched it and suddenly remembered another NR movies called ""Scary movies"" and then asked myself--Is stupidity now legal and official or official and legal? Are we on a brink of propaganda's wave trying to push  stupidity as new normal? Where are the limits? At some point I thought pornography is stupid but these flicks break new grounds. Viva!",1385769600,,469,4.777777777777778
2682305,5,B000K405CY,Oh the 90's brought us some good movies.  This is Charlie Sheen at his best!  They are great parodies from other movies.  This is where the parody's started from at least I think so.,1382054400,,182,4.294117647058823
2682306,3,B000K405CY,"This was in between okay and good.  The first movie was a parody of Top Gun, and the second movie was a parody of Rambo II and III... I remember Sylvester Stallone wanting to do a Rambo IV in 1990's but because of this movie, he said, 'thanks to Hot Shots Deux, I don't feel the need for a Rambo IV anymore."" He shook his head.  So why did he change his mind and do Rambo IV in 2008? It wasn't that good, story was depressing, and too violent.  Thank you hot Shots, I consider Rambo IV being made fun of...",1381276800,,506,3.99009900990099
2682307,5,B000K405CY,"I love the play off on top gun and on rambo.  It's all done in good humor.  Even the romatic scenes, just at the point where they start to get 'steamy' have slapstick humor creep in.",1381017600,,182,4.027777777777778
2682308,5,B000K405CY,"This item a little slower than usual, but you can only expect a little stall here and there coming this far North. Love both of these movies. Thanks!",1380672000,,149,4.357142857142857
2682309,4,B000K405CY,"I love play on words.  So listen carefully.  The sight gags are a little old, but then I've seen these movies on tv a few times.",1376784000,,128,3.8846153846153846
2682310,4,B000K405CY,If you like a good old fashion spoof then this will entertain you. I watch these types of movies for an quick laugh.,1376611200,,116,4.086956521739131
2682311,4,B000K405CY,Ultimate satire that equals the Naked Gun series. Classic sight and verbal gags that will keep you in stitces. Charlie Sheen has joined Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges as the kings of satire.,1375401600,,192,4.848484848484849
2682312,5,B000K405CY,These movies are very funny and I will enjoy seeing them over and over with my friends.  Even better than I had hoped.,1369267200,,118,4.130434782608695
2682313,5,B000K405CY,I love these funny shows. There's none like them. I do hope they don't try to make a different Hot Shots in the future cause seems like these days they are going back to 80's finding movies to recopy.,1368748800,,200,4.153846153846154
2682314,4,B000K405CY,"I liked the Hot Shots! movies, but I think I confused this movie with another movie.  I still enjoyed them because they were funny.  The acting was good.",1367798400,,153,4.428571428571429

2682316,5,B000K405CY,"If you love Airplane! and films like Police Squad, Scary Movie, etc. then you'll enjoy these as well. They are silly, stupid and over the top, which is exactly what you need sometimes.",1364083200,,184,4.606060606060606
2682317,5,B000K405CY,Both the movies are full of take offs from other movies but what the hey. I can't help but enjoy them. I find it very convenient to buy two or more movies in one case like this. It's mindless humor but well worth it.,1362960000,,216,3.9318181818181817
2682318,3,B000K405CY,Good movie if you like silly ans stupid slapstick comedy. worth watching over and over. I love this simple type of comedy.,1362700800,,122,4.590909090909091

2682323,4,B000K405CY,There isn't a whole lot you can say about these 2 movies. They are probably some of the most ridiculous films ever made. There were times when I things couldn't get more insane. They did. To top it off they made a freakin' sequel. There are very few movies out there that will make you laugh like these. If that's what you're after then the Hot Shots double feature is a great buy.,1352764800,3,381,4.232876712328767

2682326,5,B000K405CY,Unlike many combo movies these two are a match and some of the funniest spoof movies of all times. When I found the combo with both movies in it I knew I had to have it. I ordered it on Monday and by Tuesday evening I was watching the movies.,1331078400,2,242,3.86

2682328,3,B000K405CY,"The title, once again, pretty much sums up my opinion regarding this set comprising two films that had given spoof films a huge boost in their time. The films have achieved somewhat cult status in the eyes of their patrons, and I must agree that during my first viewing I had found both of the movies (esp. ""Part Deux"") quite hillarious. But after that, I found that some of the one-liners (accompanied by Charlie Sheen and Valeria Goleno's facial expressions) got etched into my mind pretty strongly, while the gags kept getting thinner. However, even with these issues, I would have rated the set pretty highly had the films remained uncut, but for some strange reason the films appeared to have lost significant footage (esp. ""Part Deux"") in this set that reduced their value considerably. Therefore, the movies are recommended, but not this set. Get them individually, and have a laugh.",1313798400,,890,4.900662251655629

2682331,1,B000K405CY,"I purchased this box set because it was the movie that my husband and I went to see on our very 1st date back in 1991.  We have fond memories of that evening and so for our 10yr wedding anniversary i purchased the set as we were taking a trip down memory lane to mark our special occasion.  We put the DVD in, but couldn't finish watching it.  The movie was really quite terrible, the jokes, if they can be called that, are so obvious and over the top it's bordering on pathetic.  Quite a waste of money.",1279238400,,504,4.112244897959184
