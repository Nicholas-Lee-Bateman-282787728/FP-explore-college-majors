8736378,5,B016E9JFII,"Well worth the money for those interested in improving their balance, posture, and overall health. Scott Jensen is an outstanding instructor and hugely accomplished expert in Qi Gong and Tai-Chi.  I bought the CD over a year ago and have used the first section (warm-up) exercises at least 150 times in the last 12 months.  Using the CD as a ""real-time"" classroom substitute has been a lifesaver for me in terms of my posture, balance, and learning that western medicine is not the only solution to improved health.  Scott is a natural teacher with a calm voice and temperament that embody his life-long commitment to sharing his vast knowledge of both Qi-Gong and Tai-Chi.",1509840000,2,673,4.885964912280702
