7788080,5,0473164450,"Unlike the dodo, not many people outside of New Zealand had heard of this species until a video about a kakapo named Sirocco was featured on YouTube. The video showing the bird getting frisky with Stephen Fry, one of the people in the ""Last Chance to See"" series, made Sirocco an instant star and premier ""spokesbird"" for his kind. Unlike the dodo, kakapos are very much alive though number less than 200 in the world.
It's hard to imagine that this type of parrot (nocturnal, ground dwelling, flightless and large) is still around today, but thanks to a group of determined people at the Kakapo Recovery Project there is still hope for the survival of this bird. The video documents some of the life of these birds (and yes, they all have names) and the efforts being made to save them. just for fun, find the video of Sirocco on YouTube and you'll see where the word ""fap"" may have come from!",1364601600,2,894,4.5246913580246915
