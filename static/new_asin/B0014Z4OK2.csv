8256640,3,B0014Z4OK2,"Shaggy, for those who are not familiar with his style, is a jamaican-born, NY-based reggae singer with very varied and ecclectic influencies. Purists of reggae root usually dislike him for his inclusion of hip hop,rap, rock, latin and even calypso rhythms in his songs, and the guy is not afraid of unabashedly intercalate other artists'ultra popular hooks here and there. Does Boombastic from '96 ring a bell ?

I bought it out of curiosity because all I knew from him was the aforementioned song and video from the radio and TV back in the day an remembered it as ultra-cool. This gig was lifted from the original tapes the german TV station broadcasted in '98. The dual-layer DVD offers 2 versions of the concert : the original 4:3 broadcast and a 16:9 (cropped top and bottom with a somewhat shorter running time and an MTVesque edition)
The original footage is the one I went for first

The good : Filming and editing are top-notch; not an analog artifact spotted throught the 100'. Had I been told this was a digital recording I had swallowed it. The gig is energetic, has HUGE bottom end -I turned off my sub- a lot of funny in-between-songs banter and good overall sound. There are 2 audio streams : lossy stereo and fake 5.1

The bad : The mix has inexcusable flaws. The huge bottom end comes mostly from the kick-drum which goes BOOM BOOM BOOM for the duration of the gig and the bass guitar is mixed-in too softly, which is ANATHEMA for anything reggae-related. The rest of the drumkit is audible but not as loud as it should. Shaggy's voice is too loudly mixed-in as well, so if you want a reasonable volume level for the intruments you will have to put out with some irritating shouting. Well after all this was captured by a TV crowd and sometimes they just don't nail the mix for every type of music. Could it have been corrected at the post-production stage or maybe introduced by it ? Can't tell.

The widescreen version runs for about 95' with some banter edited out and crazy rapid-fire editing with  lots of bad-taste, cheesy old school chroma, filtering and contrast effects. The audio is yet worse; boomier yet and with the other instruments yet less audible in the mix. Remember Limp Bizkit's official DVD ?! Same thing. Of course in order to cram 2 long versions of something with stereo and surround mixes you have to author the DVD with a lower pic bitrate, which averages a poor 5 Kbps; good for a CRT TV but don't expect a superb pic on a big led tv.

Buy at your own risk; you might not like it.",1351814400,,2524,4.512035010940919
