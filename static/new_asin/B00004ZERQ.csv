1384084,4,B00004ZERQ,"Hollywood shuffle is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. All the more amazing is the fact that it is a polictical vehicle. Directing attention to a need for greater civil awareness in films,as well as a call to abandon stuborn race-based type casting.  When I watch this film I am enchanted with the assertive and empathetic feel of it's overall drive-Robert Townsend has a wonderful sense of humor and he is fighting the good fight.  As a person with white skin-I feel he is a good teacher of some much needed lessons in understanding one another.",977875200,3,573,4.607843137254902
1384085,5,B00004ZERQ,"unlike many of Robert Townsend's films after the Five Heartbeats that i had to give the Finger to like he does here in this film this is a Tour De Force.sadly the Stereotypes are still the norm in Hollywood for Black Actress's&Actor's.not much has really changed int he way the film business works.it's all about flavor&Cosmetics as Robert Townsend puts it down here.this movie had me rolling so hard.a laugh a minute.the movie is so real.sadly aside from The Five Heartbeats Robert Townsend never got this honest&real again.but at least i have him here,also on the Five Heartbeats&Cooley High.",977616000,,594,5.01010101010101
1384086,5,B00004ZERQ,"RObert Townsend made this movie on a low budget, but you would never know it. He is superb in this movie and this is a laugh a minute. The movie deals with the silliness of stereotypes in the movies.  Its a great movie for those of us who like to laugh at ourselves and don't take life too seriously. I promise you that you will love this movie. It is one of my alltime favorites. It also is out of print as I understand because some found the depictions in the movie to be insensitive. I didnt. There was pressure from others however to stop pressing this movie thus it is hard to find.",977011200,,587,4.149122807017544
1384087,5,B00004ZERQ,"I have seen a lot movies that Robert Townsend played in and actually liked them so much that I would add them to my collections and look at dozen of time and never get tried looking at them.

1384098,5,B00004ZERQ,"One of the greatest African American satire comedies ever made. This was Robert Townsend's first feature, that he wrote and directed using credit cards to complete. The plot is that Robert is an aspiring actor, Bobby Taylor, who lands a role in a film called, ""Jive time Jimmy's Revenge"",. However, the movie is full of black stereotypes and he begins to wrestle if he wants to be portray his people in that way. He lampoons the stereotypes in Hollywood and keeps you in stitches making some very relevant points. I especially liked Black Acting School and The Homeboy Film review. He does these sequences in daydreams which he used to show his comedic chops. He would use the same technique in his show, The Parenthood. This movie also featured Anne-Marie Johnson, Keenan Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans and John Weatherspoon. A must see for aspiring actors as well as something to simply enjoy!",1496880000,,891,4.868421052631579

1384185,4,B00004ZERQ,"I used to watch this movie over and over when I was a teenager. Some of the humor was funnier back in the 80s when it was made, but it is still an enjoyable flick. Robert Townsend financed the whole thing with his personal credit cards.",1383523200,,236,4.1521739130434785
1384186,5,B00004ZERQ,"My husband and I were watching a movie - and the acting was kinda bad. Then my husband stated that it kind of reminded him of Hollywood Shuffle. ""Black Acting School"" went through my mind, a jingle from Hollywood Shuffle, that highlighted the typecasting roles many black people were stuck in back in the day: In a horror/action film the only black person in the movie was ALWAYS the first person to die. Or we were the butler, slave, or down-casted group that had to be saved, etc. We really have come a long way. And thanks to movies like this that brought about more awareness. And it really is hilarious!",1380326400,,608,4.486486486486487
1384187,4,B00004ZERQ,"This movie has aged a bit but is still a fun watch and a good reminder of how far we've come. The stereotyped acting roles available to black actors depicted in this movie have for the most part, disappeared from view (except for the occasional reappearance on comedy shows and routines.) My two sons (both acting majors in college) found Robert Townsend's portrayal of the travails of both his and the black actors' experience trying to make it in 1980's Hollywood both hilarious and  informative. It did allow us to have a good discussion about typecasting and following your dreams. In a nod to Robert Townsend, it also allowed for a discussion about making your own breaks. Look up how he went out on a limb to get this movie (and his big break) made.",1377216000,,755,4.592592592592593

1384189,4,B00004ZERQ,"""There's always work at the post office.""  If only that were true.

But this is the line that Robert Townsend, an aspiring actor in his own film, has to keep hearing from his grandmother.  She doesn't like the racist parts that Mr. Townsend is auditioning for, and for good reason.  Of course, those parts are way over the top, a satirical look -- and deconstructionist look -- at Hollywood in years gone by.

But times have surely changed now, thanks to Mr. Townsend himself.  I read part of a review that seemed to imply that blacks are still getting lousy parts in films, and I whole-heartedly disagree with that.  Just look at Denzel Washington in ""Flight.""  How many white guys wanted that role?  And Morgan Freeman in ""Dolphin Tale"" is the same.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Freeman played the role of a true-life scientist who is white, and if the role were reversed, there most likely would be more than an outcry.  But it is often the case that people come up with causes -- some of them good, one that Mr. Townsend brought up 25 years ago -- but then people continue to act as if the cause still needs fighting, even though the battle perhaps has been won.  That would be the trouble with most causes to me.

With regards to the film, surely one of the funnier films ever, just a notch below ""The Jerk"" and ""Pet Detective 1.""  As a matter of fact, I've always wondered what Jim Carrey meant when he called his computer buddy ""Mandingo,"" and I finally looked it up today because they used the same name in this film.  It's a film that I put on my queue, and it is one that got really mixed reviews.  I can't give a ""thumbs up or a thumbs down"" yet on that, like our two movie critic buddies in this film.  (There is a hilarious scene where Mr. Townsend and his friend sneak into a theater and pretend to be Siskel and Ebert.  I'm sure that Mr. Ebert got a good chuckle out of that when he was still alive.)

Well, times have changed:  it's maybe easier to get a job in Hollywood now than the post office, the latter a government agency that's closing doors left and right.  And it's surely easier for blacks to get good roles as well, thanks to Mr. Townsend.  And like his portrayal of Ebert in that funny scene, I give a ""big thumbs up"" to ""Hollywood Shuffle.""",1365552000,,2267,4.322274881516588

1384195,4,B00004ZERQ,"To make a film that is this good with as little as Townsend had to work with truly is nothing short of a logistical triumph!  By begging cinematographers for leftover film stock, borrowing every dollar he could find including his personal credit cards, talking cast and crew into working for deferred payments and making that same crew wear UCLA shirts in order to circumvent the enormous expense of film permits in Los Angeles, Townsend made an expensive-looking movie for less than $100,000.  The film is not perfect, and how could it be given how little he had to work with, but it is a testament to Townsend's shear determination!

Hollywood Shuffle is strongest when its protagonist, jaded with his dead-end job and the stereotypical roles he lands, wanders into his daydreams.  The highlights of these are ""Black Acting School"" with Townsend delivering a pitch-perfect British accent in a world that would never want it and his parody of the iconic Sam Spade.  How this didn't make him a household name is beyond me, but, then, Townsend is satirizing a subject matter so uncomfortable that it is simply easier to pretend it doesn't exist.",1308182400,2,1144,4.9067357512953365
1384196,3,B00004ZERQ,"This movie is a classic comedy of importance. Written by and starring Robert Townsend and Keenan Ivory Wayans, this is a under watched yet innovative film. It tells the story of a young black actor who, while auditioning for a role, imagines himself in different movies.

""Black Acting School"" teaches you have to play pimps, muggers, and punks. Light skinned blacks need not apply.

This film includes some wonderful, yet underutilized black actors, like Anne-Marie Johnson, John Witherspoon, & Helen Martin and highlights the long road to making black movie in Hollywood.

""Death of a Break Dancer"" is a Sam Spade style noir piece, with Damon Wayans as the snitch and Keenan Ivory Wayans as `Jheri Curl'.

When Bobby is finally cast in a movie, he struggles with the movie's sterotypes vs his own values. Filled with black and latino sterotypes are over the top and truly unrealistic, causing him to feel like he is betraying not only himself, but his family.

It is interesting that 20 years after this movie was made, it is still relevant. There is still a dearth of good roles for black people.

This is one of the monologues, which speaks to following your dreams:

""What if you do make it? What if you are that good? You can never know until you try. You gotta give it your all. You gotta give it everything you got. I know, cause it happened to me. I stopped believing in me, I started listening to all those other people tell me what I couldn't do. I kept listening and listening until one day I started believing them. I quit. When I was singing, I was the happiest man alive. There ain't nothing to it, but to do it."" Uncle Ray to Bobby",1280448000,,1647,4.562711864406779

1384210,5,B00004ZERQ,"""Hollywood Shuffle"" remains, even after two decades, a remarkable achievement. This is both hilarious and poignant at the same time. And the characters are rich and multidimensional: the wanna-be-actor forced to take parts that are inappropriate to even approximate his dreams, the practical grandmother invoking career opportunities at the post office in the name of family security, and household youngsters, looking at the older children as models and stars, their own little lights to guide their futures. The arc of the question of human dignity versus the omnipresence of stereotypes, lack of opportunity, and economic necessity is classical human drama of man versus fate and himself drawn with an expertise that is remarkable.

And the fantasy scenes are some of the best comic inversion ever put on film. The white-persons school of black acting will make your sides ache, and you'll rewind it a dozen times.

While there are some flaws in overly constructed dialogue, and some clear budget constraints on production, and some hits and misses on topical and sense of humor, this is a highly recommended film that speaks as loudly today as it did upon first viewing.

He works for a crummy hot dog stand called Rinky-Dinky Dog(no, really) with idiotic co-workers as well as an idiotic boss. The only problem Bobby faces is the negative roles that Follywood tends to offer black people. He soon has to make a decision if he wants to go with the BS roles of the movie industry or to go a different route.

Opinion: This movie hits the nail on the head with the types of roles that Follywood has destined for us to play. Its funny as well as sharp in its delivery. The Black Acting School skit has to be the funniest sketch in the movie. The black detective is the second funniest thing. Sure most people might say that the acting is over-the-top but these actors who play in the types of movies that Hollywood Shuffle parodies are always over the top with their performance so what are you talking about? I respect Hollywood Shuffle for using humor to address a serious subject instead of stooping to the brainless comic dung that you get from these Chittlin Circuit movies that are produced nowadays. And the sad thing is that people are trouncing gems like Hollywood Shuffle while embracing minstrel rubbish like Soul Plane, Norbit, Code Name: The Cleaner, Juwanna Mann etc. A sad state of affairs. In closing I would say support comedies like Hollywood Shuffle any chance you get. They're the only bright light you get in the dark tunnel of comedy in Hollywood.",1209600000,2,1727,4.677631578947368

Movies in general are so formulaic that even most independent films are pretty routine and by-the-numbers.

Maybe that's why ""Hollywood Shuffle"" feels so refreshing, like a much-needed change of pace. Most indies are made almost entirely by hand---one man writing, directing, and of course, producing (hey, they need every single spare little red cent they can get their grubby little hands on) and this one is no exception.

Townsend wears all the indie hats here... and he wears them proudly... and well.

This is the film that introduced the world to Robert Townsend. Well, that was it's whole purpose. Like Ed Burns' ""The Brother McMullen,"" this star-vehicle was written and directed by Townsend about his dream to make it as a professional actor, trying to break into Hollywood, while at the same time, trying to over-come the cruel limitations mainstream Hollywood has set up for black people who want to act... and actors, in general.

Whereas the '70's was the birth decade of the blaxploitation, so many of them were just cheap, cheesy, corny knock-offs of popular white films. Blaxploitation got more blacks into films, but the films themselves weren't really about anything. ""Hollywood Shuffle"" is a Blaxploitation film that really has something to say... that has an agenda.

There is so much burning talent, so many struggling entertainers wanting to make something of themselves, that Hollywood can afford to treat the auditioning talent the same way a really strong cleanser treats germs.

Townsend's efforts to make this movie are inspiring--he borrowed every dollar he could, asked for movie footage that was left on the cutting-room floor, called in every favor he could, threw everything he had and more to get this one made.

To tell his story, get his foot in the door... and at the same time, tell a story about what this kind of life is like. For those with talent who dare to dream big.

The great Keenan Ivory Wayans (who co-wrote this one) and John Witherspoon have bit players as people who work at the local hog stand in the neighborhood who don't ask for much out of life... and don't get it. They're the kind of cynics who spend their lives saying, ""You're a fool for following your dreams.""

When you near the end of your journey in this world, you really fully understand the meaning of the old phrase, ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained.""

Townsend interlocks a variety of skits with this all-too autobiographical tale that are in the vein of blaxploitation--""Superman,"" ""Rambo,"" ""Siskel & Ebert"" and a commercial for Black Actors who want steady work.

All of which are pretty funny and inspiring. You have to admire the way that Townsend wants to put out some legitimate roles for black actors to play and black actors to idolize. But most of his skits go on too long after the point has been made and there are quite a few moments that feel like someone (Townsend obviously) should have punched up. Townsend is a far better actor than he is a writer or director.

Perhaps because he is only a filmmaker by necessity for this one. He's more interested in using this to make up of all those dream roles he never got to play and showing his chops as an actor than really making a great movie.

There's a scene where he makes fun of ""Siskel & Ebert""--before everyone started doing it.
Almost all the skits (where Townsend is fantasizing his dream roles as an actor) go on way too long, probably because Townsend is far less concerned with how funny the skits/movie is and more interested in using this movie to play all the dream roles he never got to before.

Every single actor is perfectly cast, especially Townsend himself. It's great to see
The movie captures the struggle of the out-of-work actor just right. We see lines and lines of actors warming-up, rehearsing their roles, going into the audition... all to hear, ""Thank you, no. Next!"" But some blessed, precious few are picked.

But those that are black are given racially-biased drivel to perform. Ethnic caricatures that shame and set back their race. Brothers and sisters who talk like stock characters frm the slave era, wearing redneck farm clothes, picking cotton, eating chicken and getting stinking drunk. Townsend tirades many black archetypes, most of which went out of style around the same time as blackface. Lil' Bobby obviously wants to say something about the way the brothers and sisters are treated in the biz.

There are some moments here you'll roar with laughter at. As well as moments that'll actually put a lump in your throat and a strange feeling of hope and pride. And there's another bit that spoofs the well-worn private eye genre, where the dick is after a killer Jeri Curl.

Like many other breakthrough films, especially independents, ""Hollywood Shuffle"" was another arrival of a fresh new talent. It happens as often as the rise and setting of the suns, but here is a film where it feels a little more special... because Townsend was really about something. You can see it here, not only in some of his satirist scenes, but some of the quieter moments where real drama in brewing and dreams are at stake.

We see where Townsend is asking himself if he's good enough, if he face the whole world (which is how it is when you're struggling to make it as an entertainer... or in life) and when life-long happiness is at stake. It almost hurts. And at the end of it all, when we wonder for Townsend's character, Bobby's sake... what will become of him? And then we realize we already know. We just found out.

It's like looking in the sky at the stars like you always do... and then there's a brand-new star shining in the night sky, standing out just a little bit bigger than the others. Haven't seen that one before. Hey, is that a new one? Couldn't be, could it? I don't remember... there are so many. Another star is born.

Or made.

1384232,1,B00004ZERQ,"Was this a comedy or was it a drama?  I begin this review by asking this question because the film that I just witnessed, Hollywood Shuffle, was neither funny or rather dramatic.  While it tried so hard to make a point, because of this lack of definition (comedy or drama), the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost.  While I am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in Hollywood, even today, I do not believe that Townsend's directorial debut did much to stop it.  Instead, I feel it only added more fuel to the fire.  Townsend's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of, he was instead promoting and vice versa.  The parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy.  Townsend had a decent concept with this film, but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film.  If you watch the preview before the film (which I constantly do), you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see.  The preview gives the impression of a very intelligent, comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers, but the actually film could not be further from the truth.

The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not story itself (because it is lacking in elaboration); it is Townsend's direction.  He had a wonderful concept with this film.  Exploit the Hollywood that exploits our race.  Decent idea, but why couldn't he execute it very well?  The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic.  The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital, we are literally everywhere without any warning or map.  It was obvious that Townsend had quite a bit to say, but only a short amount of time to do it in.  So, instead of defining his characters, developing his themes, and actually creating a smart film, he just throws it all together and prays that it works.  Sadly, it doesn't.  Instead of a smart comedy, we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas, comedic skits, and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable.  What hurts Townsend the most are his brief, attempt to be funny, interruptions throughout the film.  From battling a villain known as Jerry Curl to parodying Siskel & Ebert, Townsend's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters.  This is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally.  While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in Hollywood, he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and clich in the book.  What could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.

So, if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story, perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the Wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story.  WRONG!  The Wayans are in this film, but Townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family.  Definitely in their pre-In Living Color moments, we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon.  Perhaps it was Townsend's direction, or just maybe this atrocious story, but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film.  I just thought that with the talent pool that Townsend had to pull from that Hollywood Shuffle would have been funny, bright, and a true stab at this obvious Hollywood dilemma.  Sadly, it was none of the above.

Finally, I would like to say that this was a workable film.  There were some moments (while they were few and way far between) that had a smile on my face, the final product just didn't settle well with me.  Townsend can be funny, but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself, instead of through his personal experiences and troubles.  I realize that he was probably speaking the truth, but it never came through as that.  Instead, we are threaded through a weak story, which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom, but surely didn't work for this film.  Even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film, I would have to disagree.  If you are starting fresh, either have a tight script or defined themes.  Townsend had neither of these, and combined with the inability to control his actors, he just failed in a ball of flames.

Overall, this was rather disappointing to watch.  It reminded me of a grade school Spelling Bee where it is finally your child's time to spell.  The word is tough, but as the first two to three letters come out, you think that it is going to work perfectly, but then there is that random ""P"" and silent ""R"" that forces your excitement to come tumbling down.  That is how I felt with Hollywood Shuffle.  At first, I saw the potential, I saw the theme and the motive behind the picture, but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes, I experienced that deep fall feeling.  Townsend sank his own ship on this one, and I don't think Hollywood Shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of Hollywood cinema.

1384237,5,B00004ZERQ,"Robert Townsend hit the nail on the proverbial head with this movie that exposes the foolishness and racism that permeates Hollywood, and the changes that blacks and Latinos have to endure just to audition for a simple movie. The moral of this flick, of course, is that you don't have to sell out because, after all, ""there's always work at the post office."" Not only is this a lie (there ain't too much work anywhere for a black man), but it oversimplifies the issue: talent should speak for itself and black people should not have to be relegated to ""coon roles,"" ""slave skits"" and drug dealer pimp scenarios when whites are playing a wide gamut of roles, many of them that they aren't even qualified for. Highlights of this incredibly lucid movie are the two brothers who review movies ala Ebert and Roeper, including one about ""the attack of the zombie pimps;"" the flashback/dream that Bobbie has of himself as a detective in Sam Ace; Keenan Wayans' hilarious portrayal of a thug named ""Jerry Curl;"" a TV star who plays a black bat that lives in a white suburban house, ""Battie Boy;"" and who can forget Winky Dinky Dog, the place where Bobby works, a place where you can really advance (""Look at Tiny; he's only been here six months, and he's assistant crew chief .... Look at me -- I went from two dollars to two sixty five. I got responsibility!""). But Bobby will have none of that. A touching scene in a barber shop where his uncle tells him to never give up on his dreams the way he (the barber) did, puts much needed emotion and seriousness into what is otherwise a laugh-a-minute parody. One of the lines in the movie that Bobby is auditioning for, a stereotype-riddled flick directed by whites, is ""why you wanna pull a knife own me? I don't be got no weapon.""

Townsend is talking about the lack of equality and degeneration of black probity in this film, which is currently at an all-time high in modern music. This movie not only commentates about prejudice in Hollywood, but the ignorance of the people who consume the stereotypical garbage. This movie is hilarious and disheartening. The absurdity strikes home when you realize that these formulated characters and shows appear on your television today. This film did remind me of Bamboozled as well, but Hollywood Shuffle is nowhere near as caustic toward [stereo]type-casting.

1384239,5,B00004ZERQ,"Robert Townsend's first film Hollywood Shuffle is a hilarious satire that cleverly condemns the way Blacks are treated in the entertainment industry. It's clear that Townsend knows his material and uses that insider knowledge to poke fun at the sterotypical way blacks are portrayed on TV and in film. Through satire Townsend makes fun of Hollywood while telling everyone the truth about how hard it is for black actors.
 Desperate to get the lead role in ""Jivetime Jimmy's revenge"" struggling actor Bobby aspires to become a superstar while working at a dead end job at Winky Dinky Dog. During Bobby's journey, we learn that and the road to stardom for African-Americans is full of compromises that force intelligent hardworking black actors to degrade and humiliate themselves in order to get a break. As he gets the lead role in Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge, Bobby must wonder if his dignity and self-respect are worth sacrificing to achieve his dream.
Robert Townsend makes a groundbreaking film and his cast of then unknowns gives great performances. After this film was produced most of the cast of this film went on to successful careers John Witherspoon, Keenan Ivory Wayans and Rusty Cundieff are just a few of the people who became stars as a result of this film I think every African-American who wants to work in the entertainment industry or any African American who already is and actor needs to watch this film.

In Hollywood Shuffle Townsend confronts dignity, self pride, racism, stereotypes, and the loss of cultural consciousness all merged together in one film. Not only is this movie hysterically funny, but what Townsend relays in the film is sadly true and still exists today in Hollywood. Townsend intelligently displays how African-American actors were and still in some cases are subjected to playing certain roles such as thieves, butlers, gangsters, pimps, and drug dealers for example. Hollywood Shuffle also indicates that in some instances African American actors limit their own potential for success. This is an excellent film that was way well ahead of it's time. Hollywood Shuffle has a striking resemblance to Bamboozled, which should be sited as that film's predecessor. This movie not only causes you to laugh hysterically in tears.

A great lesson and a fine film. Robert Townsend shows brilliance and promise, as star & director. His later films couldn't quite match this first blast of originality. Though racial stereotypes are pretty much the center of attention, the broader theme of integrity and self-respect shine through like a beacon...a beacon that I wish more directors of racially-themed films would heed. (John Singleton comes to mind; never since matched the gut-power of ""Boyz 'n the Hood"".) The fact that Mr. Townsend is so self-effacing, while still refusing to give in, made me want to stand up and cheer. It's a fun film, well made, and perfectly entertaining.
