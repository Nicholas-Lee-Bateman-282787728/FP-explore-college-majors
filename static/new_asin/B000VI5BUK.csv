8218724,5,B000VI5BUK,"I purchased this for my 4-5 yr old at preschool. I had misread the age group and thought it was for 5-7 yr olds so when it came and I read the back where it said it was for 7-12 year olds I thought what the heck we'll give it a try. My kids LOVE it! It's more of a dance workout video. The leader on the video breaks down the moves and then after practicing a bit he picks up the tempo and they're off and dancing. They have done the video about 4 times and they are really getting it down and they're only 4 and 5 years old! It is fast paced and they are getting a really good workout even if they don't get all the moves down, they are moving and that's whats important. I tried it with them one day and I can tell you it is quite a workout! The yoga portion of the video has some challenging moves but they are doing well with that too. The first time I saw all 15 of them in the downward dog position I just had to laugh. It was the cutest thing ever! I'm really glad I purchased this video. It's a great addition to our exercise videos!",1458777600,8,1041,3.869158878504673

8218726,5,B000VI5BUK,"Kids lack proper exercise and nutrition these days.  I bought this for the classroom and the kids had so much fun with it.  They ask me to play it daily for them, which I have been doing.  You don't have to push kids with this movie, they find it delightful",1344470400,4,257,4.1
8218727,5,B000VI5BUK,The first time we played this video for our daughter she was up and dancing with the instructor within the first few minutes. A few days later I came home to find my daughter and her friend both dancing to the video! Good music and engaging instructors! The yoga make for a great calming period too!,1237680000,4,299,4.357142857142857
