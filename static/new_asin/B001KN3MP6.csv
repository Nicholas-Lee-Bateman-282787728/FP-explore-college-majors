8315453,5,B001KN3MP6,"I saw this fun little short tonight at the Central Wisconsin Film Festival and was impressed! For a 'micro'-scopic budget these filmmakers managed to offer up a sweet taste of Midwest living! The dialog has a Kevin Smith flavor at times which is not a bad thing! A little bit of video game banter but not so much that a newbie would be pulled out of the story. Just enough to get us into the world of the four main characters.

Cinematically, the film was quite solid. From graceful pans to fluid tracking shots as the actors walk down the streets of beautiful Stevens Point and Wausau, Wisconsin... this film took advantage of it's visuals. Especially with a rather clever introduction shared by the two main leads!

The acting was about what you would expect. For the most part is was believable and seemed to flow. The two female leads were particularly fun! I liked the 'accessories' (although I would have cut that scene a little differently)!

The movie has some great moments. I really liked our introduction to the father! I laughed out loud at that part! But something about it seemed a little fishy?!

The story itself is that tried and true tale of coming of age. Leaving for college and wondering what the future will hold. Shake a little Wisconsin seasoning into the soup (keggers n' brats) and you'll have 'Microcosm'! A great little flick!

Anyway, support these guys as they have loads of potential and are making some great things happen in Central Wisconsin!!",1226102400,3,1477,4.709302325581396
