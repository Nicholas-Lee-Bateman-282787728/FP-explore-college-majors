7798289,2,1573623474,this was mark coleman being mismatched with a bunch of guys that he outclassed. bohlander and abbott were on the other side of the bracket and weren't able to advance for one reason or another. ufc 10 was better.,1160438400,,212,4.461538461538462
7798290,1,1573623474,"I was actually at this event in Augusta, GA 10 years ago! I gave it it 1 star for nostalgia's sake, but speaking as an a rabid MMA fan, the only great part of UFC 11 was meeting Ken Shamrock and Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson. I have since met Mark Coleman in Ohio, and he has mentioned what a blunder that show became. Save yourself the $, but if you do make the mistake of ordering this debacle, keep an eye out for the skinny 16 year old kid in the stands!",1139961600,,452,3.9239130434782608
7798291,3,1573623474,"Easily the poorest of my favorite UFC format, the 8 man tournament.  Four  good (not great) fights, one poor fight, and one horrible fight.  No final  bout, as Mark Coleman is the only man left standing.  This video showcases  Tank's only bad fight.  Win or lose, when Tank gets in the octagon, you  know there's going to be a fight.  This time...",965606400,,347,4.467741935483871
7798292,2,1573623474,"This tournament had the makings of a good show. We had Mark Coleman returning to defend his tourney championship, along with some veterans(Ferozzo, Abbott, and Bohlander), and Jiu-Jitsu champ Fabio Gurgel.  Coleman breezed to the finals, destroying his competition rather easily. It  was the second half of the bracket where the problems began. The winner of  the Bohlander-Gurgel fight wound up injured and unable to continue. The  substitute won the next fight, but was injured for the finals. It was a  mess!  A Superfight of any sorts was needed badly!",964137600,,556,5.122222222222222
7798293,3,1573623474,"Even though this was a better than average event, the title fight was horrible.  Witness the return of Mark Coleman, Brian Johnston, Jerry Bohlander, Tank Abbott, and Scott Ferrozzo, but don't expect to be blown  away at the end...",917654400,5,231,4.897435897435898
