620618,5,6303257828,"Authentic faith based movie.  The writers, producers, and actors, demonstrate deep insight into the faith and obedience based rewarding life of Abraham, and why he is said to be, ""God's friend.""  Viewing this movie in private, over and over, has significantly developed and strengthened my faith and belief in God.  For a limited budget, it is nevertheless, an outstanding movie.  Recommended for seeking Christians, and non-Christians.",1054684800,9,436,5.5606060606060606
620619,4,6303257828,"If life was anywhere near as dreary and depressing back then as this movie depicts people really didn't have much to live for.  Their main goal in life was getting enough food and water for themselves and their livestock.  People at that time weren't much more than cave men or basically animals themselves.  Throughout the movie Abraham looks like he hasn't washed his hair in weeks and he appears to be constantly dying of thirst.  He looks to be about 200 years old when the movie starts so I don't know how old he's supposed to be at the end.

The only humorous event in the entire movie was when God tells Sarah she will have a child when she was about 90 years old.  She laughed which is what the name 'Isaac' means.

Abraham believed in a single God while other around him believed in many gods.  This has been a source of conflict from the beginning and caused the eventual destruction of Atlantis.

A very frightening event in Abe's life was when Sarah was kidnapped to become a sexual slave of the evil Egyptian pharoah.  It's impossible to know what a person like this would have been capable of doing to a female who refused to submit to their will.  (Barbara was in that nice movie called 'The Entity'.)  God sent a fever on the entire Egyptian population so that the evil pharoah would return Sarah and let the Hebrews go away.  God sending diseases and death on people is nothing to fool around with.

There are many similarities between the lives of Abraham and Moses.  Both had problems with the Egyptians who represent the belief in many gods which included injustice and oppression of others.  The Egyptians at that time represented the mysterious occult world.

The pharoahs claimed to be reincarnations of gods.  Abraham and Moses were reincarnations of God also in a way.  That may be why the voice of God in this movie sounds similar to Abraham's own voice.  Like Moses Abraham talked to God in a direct way.

In a movie like this it's necessary to try to read between the lines about what really happened since it's based on the bible which has gone through many translations and undoubtedly contains errors about specific details.

It's difficult to even put the events in Abe's life into perspective compared to modern society.  He didn't have any kids so his wife tells him to have a child with the slave girl that came with them from Egypt.  This was an apparent mistake on Abe's part since God did eventually give him and Sarah a child.  This serves as some type of lesson I think in that even though a mistake was made things worked out ok.  According to the closing remarks in the movie both of Abe's sons were present when he was buried.

Abraham undoubtedly loved Sarah intensely since they stayed together for their entire lives even though they didn't have any children which was probably a major stigma back then.

Movies like this are a good review of the bible in case you don't want to go back and read the bible again as I didn't but you want to review the information.  According to some other reviewers this movie stays pretty close to the scriptures.  God must have known people would make a movie about Abraham because there are quite a few important events in his life which gives the movie producers a lot of info to work with.

620620,5,6303257828,"The movie is an extraordinary portrayal of the life of Abraham.  It's entertaining, accurate, educational and stirring.  In a world filled with gods you can build, see, hold, and collect; Abraham's trust in and obedience to the invisible God is inspiring.  The up and downs of the life of faith are wonderfully depicted.  The emotional aspect of Old Testament animal sacrifice is explained in a way that theological textbooks could never rival.
Richard Harris is brilliant as the patriarch Abraham.  Barbara Hershey makes a very believable and winsome Sarah.  The costuming and scenery are outstanding.  I found only minimal disagreement between this portrayal compared to the Biblical account, the culture of the time, and the ancillary facts of history.  I would highly recommend the movie ""Abraham.""  Abraham is one of the very best movies from Turner Home Entertainment's excellent Bible Collection.  Running time 150 minutes.",1017964800,64,930,5.3517241379310345
620621,5,6303257828,"As previously mentioned in reviews of other films of this genre, I teach  ancient civilizations to middle schoolers. For this reason, I am always looking for good films of the Biblical era, and this is certainly one of the best!
Richard Harris portrays old Abraham as the fallible human being that he surely was. Barbara Hershey (Sarah) is equal to the challenge of becoming a woman who, even in her advanced years, maintains a beauty which can entice a Pharaoh of Egypt.
The research production crew of Abraham certainly did their homework. As an ancient Sumerian, Abraham was part of a thriving and wealthy culture, which invented everything from schools, to surgery, to a codified law system. They were even the formulators of astrology, which the film skillfully sites as Abraham draws the signs of the zodiac in the sand for Isaac to learn. Probably an offensive moment to Biblical purists, but nevertheless--realistic and accurate.
The Mesopotamian custom of producing a son through the wife's handmaid is handled with accuracy and tact. Relevant in light of today's Arab/Israeli conflict is the fact that this custom produced the Arab race extant today, while the children of Sarah's son Isaac became the Hebrews.
Another piece of excellent background the film delivers, is the covenant-making ceremony in the presence of the king's 'Divine Right' to rule. The scene in Haran is exceptionally well done--right down to the Sumerian's penchant for bargaining.
The animal sacrifice is handled with welcome reserve. So too, is the custom of midwifery, and how grief-stricken Sarah must've felt if she-childless, indeed did deliver so many children.
If there is any complaint with the film, one might be the portrayal of Isaac as a young teen when he was being prepared as a sacrifice by his father. Isaac was no doubt somewhat older than this according to Biblical chronology.
I shall long remember the reaction of my students to this impending sacrifice--especially from those who did not know how the story would end!
Another complaint might be the Pharaoh showing Sarah a pyramid, as if this was a new thing in Egypt. In reality, by Abraham's time, the main pyramids were several hundred years old.
In summary, this version of the Abraham is right up there with the best of the films in this genre (see my other reviews). I feel only the Joseph story is better.",1003017600,166,2367,4.962216624685139
620622,5,6303257828,"This is one of the best biblical movies I've ever seen.
This is potentially a very difficult movie to pull off, as it's really about people who do alot of damage to eachother before accepting God's will for them - but it works.
Richard Harris is amazing and totally sympathetic in the title role.  Barbara Hershey is equally good as Sarah - you really feel for both of them when they extremely reluctantly accept that Abraham's going to have to sleep with Hagar if they're ever going to have children in a time when fertility clinics were thousands of years away.  When Hagar demands some dignity as Ishmael's mother as well as a human being, you understand why this Sarah feels threatened and while not innately malicious does what she feels she has to do to protect Issac.
Abraham's relationship with Lot also plays out nicely.  When God almost casually mentions His intention to destroy Sodom the look of horror on Abraham's face reminds you that this is very personal - he's about to bargain for the life of the nephew who was so close to him before they had to go their separate ways.
And of course, it just gets worse before it gets better as Abraham is tested by having to send Ishmael out into the desert with Hagar, for all he knows to his death - and finally by being asked by God to personally kill Issac...
Wonderful performances and beautiful scenery make this one a keeper.  As another reviewer pointed out, scenes of animal sacrifice mean this one isn't for younger children.",991612800,12,1490,4.590225563909774
620623,4,6303257828,"This is a good movie. The movie covers the period shortly before Abraham's calling by God to his wandering to Egypt and finally back up to Canaan. It also tells the story of Lot as a sub-plot. It then concludes with the birth of Isaac and Ishmael and the offering of Isaac.
Scripturally, the movie is pretty sound. Their artistic license was not distracting from the Scriptures as happens sometimes in other films.
From a production point of view, it is very well done. The actors are good and even know how to show emotion (I've seen too many Biblical movies where the actors talk in some strange distant tone of voice). Lots of action, too.
This movie is definitely PG-13. It portrays some animal sacrifices and war between the four kings and Abraham, among other scenes.",978566400,23,773,4.649635036496351
620624,5,6303257828,"Without a doubt the best movie Abraham you'll find.  Richard Harris gives a masterful performance.

The story is mostly faithful to the original Biblical story, but some of the actors are too dramatic.  I do think that Barbara Hershey did a good job as Sarai, which I didn't expect she would!  She didn't try to look sexy or beautiful, but actually portrayed Sarai as a faithful and loving companion to Abraham.  Abraham, played by Richard Harris, was done fairly well - he did a pretty good job - just a few times did i think he went off track.  Overall, I think the DVD is worth a watch.  I just wish that the directors of these Biblical movies would stop trying to make the Biblical stories more ""Hollywood"" - these stories are perfect on their own merit.",1521331200,2,788,4.4

620871,4,6303257828,"I bought this as part of the revamped TNT Bible Stories Collection. I thought the movie did a good job of bringing character development to the story of Abraham.

It looks to be shot as a made-for-TV movie, so the producers did not invest a lot of money on special effects. It reminds me of movies that were featured on Lifetime.

Many Bible movies add creative dialogue and narrative to develop the story, and this movie follows that tradition. The film includes extra-biblical dialogue and themes (Abraham's relationship with his brother Nahor and father Terah, conflicts with other tribes, and Eleazor's role in the narrative, among many others). These do not take away from the biblical narrative, but enrich the story to give a better sense of Abraham's character, and serve as godly examples as to managing relationships with others. The writers added fictional elements that developed the characters of Abraham, Sarah, Eleazor, and even Pharoah, helping viewers relate to the struggle that each person experienced as Abraham pursued God in his calling. The only exception is the last shot of the movie, which is a text that is very similar, though not exact, to Genesis 25:7-10. At the end, the writer added something like ""and the two joined hands over his tombstone"" in reference to Isaac and Ishmael. This is not in the Genesis account, and seemed like an odd addition to tack on at the end of the film.

The acting is believable. Each character, both major and minor, acted well. The set design and costumes also represent the time period and culture accurately. I am not a historian, so there may be some issues, but as a layperson I got a better sense of the culture in which Abraham lived.

There are a few flaws, which is why I gave the movie four stars. The first fifteen minutes are confusing, and make it difficult for the viewer to identify the main characters of the story. There is a lot of chaos and it is difficult to know what is going on. There are some moments that the viewer will not understand without reading the biblical narrative, such as Sarah laughing after hearing the angels tell Abraham he will bear a son from Sarah. If I did not know the biblical story well, I would not have understood why Sarah laughed, due to the construction of the scene, and it feels awkward and confusing to watch. There are also infrequent editing issues in which a scene did not lead into following scene well. It is not distracting, but takes away from the craftsmanship of the movie. My only other concern was that some of the special effects were so rudimentary that they should have been left out. Specifically, I am thinking of the scene in which the angel peered out of Lot's home to blind the citizens of Sodom. A hokey white flash appears in the middle of the screen, and looks fake.

I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in understanding the Bible better. The writers did a good job with exploring the major, and even some of the minor, characters. It is not Hollywood (some readers will shout a praise for that), but is a good product that will enhance the viewer's understanding of the story of Abraham.",1511049600,,3142,4.674502712477396

I know David from the psalms....I ordered David, Joseph and Abraham it came together....I learned a lot from these movies, and I can say they didn't teach us this stuff in bible study. lots of twists and turns in this movie so I'll give a short version. Abraham was told by God to leave his fathers home in search for a new home. Abraham and some followers left to seek this place. Lots died during the journey. Abraham came to a land where Pharaoh was, he asked for help. they helped him but took his wife as a sex slave for payment. Abraham eventually got his wife out. Abraham wife desperately wanted children but could not have any so she had her servant have a child for her. Her servant became rebellious after getting pregnant with Abraham child this made a drift between Abraham wife and the servant. eventually God did bless Abraham and his wife with a son of their own name Issac. Abraham cast his first son Ishmael with the  servant out of the land..God wanted to test Abraham faith by telling him to take his youngest son Issac and sacrifice him. Abraham took his son to the mountains and was getting ready to kill him when God appeared telling him not to harm his son and that he passed the final test by obeying Gods word and getting ready to sacrifice his son...  that's the short version and there was no nudity I read some reviews about nudity I didn't see no nudity in none of the movies....I rate #1 David........#2 Abraham....#3 Joseph.....That's just my own personal rating......:)",1455062400,2,1557,4.5177304964539005

621574,5,6303257828,"From the Emmy Award-winning ""The Bible Collection"" Film Series, comes yet another epic biblical drama, straight from the pages of the Book of Genesis from within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible, entitled: ABRAHAM (See Genesis 11:27-25:11). Which magnificently depicts  the true life story of Abram, whose name was later changed by the Lord, too: ABRAHAM (Genesis 17:5). Who, by Divine instruction, left his homeland and by blind faith, journeyed from the Land of Ur of the Chaldean's too the Land of Haran, and then, on wards and into the Promised Land of Canaan (Hebrews 11:8-12). Today's, Holy Land of Israel. Specifically, the Lord spoke to ABRAHAM, saying: ""'Get out of your country, from your family and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you. I will make you a Great Nation (today's Jewish People); I will bless you and make your name, Great; And, you shall be a Blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him, who curses you; And in you, all the families of the earth, shall be blessed.' So, Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken to him..."" (Genesis 12:1-4 NKJV). Later, the Lord again confirmed His Promise to ABRAHAM, by stating: ""...I (the Lord) give to you and your descendants after you, the land in which you are a stranger, all the Land of Canaan (not portions, thereof), as an Everlasting Possession; and I will be their God"" (Genesis 17:8 NKJV). And, because ABRAHAM obeyed, he became the First Patriarch of the Jewish Nation, the spiritual Patriarch of non-Jewish, Gentile Christians and the ancestral Father of the Ishmaelite People. Which, in modern times, the descendants are known, as the: Arabic Nation. ABRAHAM's break with tradition in leaving his father Terah's' house, and that of his idol's and the established practice of idol worship to follow the voice of a single, unknown God, that he had never heard of before nor one that he could see, was accounted to ABRAHAM as ""righteousness""(v. 3), and made him known, as the ""Father of Faith"" (See Romans 4:3; 4:16-18 & 4:22 KJV). And so, Turner Pictures presents yet another enthralling, addition too, ""The Bible Collection"" Films, in this absorbing depiction of ABRAHAM. This magnificent, 1994, single-disc, color, DVD in full screen format with a Teleplay by: Robert McKee, is a Lux Spa Production in association with BetaFilm and Rai Uno. Filmed in the Atlas Mountains within the beautiful Nation of Morocco, this colossal, biographical drama, chronicling the epic life story of ABRAHAM, is Directed by: Joseph Sargent with Music by: Ennio Morricone and Marco Frisina, is nothing short of superb! It stars, Actor Richard Harris in the title role of ABRAHAM and Actress Barbara Hershey, as his wife, Sarah. Actors Vittorio Gassman and Maximilian Schell are also featured, as Terah - ABRAHAM's father and the Egyptian Pharaoh, respectively. As illustrated in reverential detail, it shows that once ABRAHAM had reached and taken possessive ownership of the Promised Land of Canaan, after a time... his nephew Lot, who had come with him from the Lands of Ur and Haran, had a parting of ways. Then, during a time of famine, ABRAHAM is forced to leave Canaan and sojourn down to Egypt, in search of food for his People. And, after a series of events upon his departure from there, he not only had the food which the Pharaoh of Egypt had given to him, but also... gold, silver and livestock, as well (Genesis 12:10-20). And, as a bonus, his beloved wife, Sarai - who also had a Divine name change too that of ""Sarah"", who had also been taken hostage by the lust-filled Pharaoh, was released, as well (Genesis 12:14-20 & 17:15 KJV). Also depicted, is the infamous destruction of the wicked, twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The rescue of his wayward, nephew Lot, from invading kings. The alliance with the neighboring Amorities. The birth of Ishmael by the Egyptian servant girl, Hagar. Followed by the Divine Visitation from the three Heavenly Visitors. In addition too, a visit from the King of Salem, with whom ABRAHAM shared Communion. Then, at long last, the Lord fulfilled His promise to ABRAHAM. Specifically, that He (the Lord), would give him a Covenant Heir. Isaac. His only son and child, by Sarah. When speaking to ABRAHAM about his barren wife Sarah, the Lord, said: ""...I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her (yet again), and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be from her."" Then ABRAHAM fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, ""Shall a child be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?"" And ABRAHAM said to God, ""Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!"" Then God, said: ""No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name, Isaac; I (the Lord) will establish My Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant, and with his descendants (the Jewish People) after him. And, as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a Great Nation (the Arabic People). But, My Covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year"" (Genesis 17:16-21 NKJV). The Birth of a Nation (the Jewish People), by way of a Promised Covenant Son - Isaac, who would perpetrate that Divine Nation was indeed, miraculous. Why? Because given the combined circumstances of old age and barrenness, the Lord created life out of human impossibility. For as the Lord, said: ""With men this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible"" (Matthew 19:26 NKJV). But,  does the Lord allow an elderly ABRAHAM to live out his days with his Covenant Son Isaac, in peace? Not quite. First, there was a brutal and supremely cruel, test-of-faith. Why? Because the Lord wanted to see where ABRAHAM's love and loyalty, was. How? By sacrificing the long awaited, Covenant Son Isaac, in the form of a burnt offering (See Genesis 22:1-18). Why did it have to be Isaac and not Ishmael? Because the birth and maturing of Isaac into manhood, complete with marriage and children, was the manifested binding-tie of the eternal, Divine Covenant. So, does ABRAHAM, who is put to the ultimate test, obey his God? If so, how does he do it?? And where is Sarah, in all of this? After all, Isaac is her only son! This intense and very powerful, biblical drama which shows for approximately 187-minutes, has a climactic and deeply-moving ending that is spiritually and historically accurate. ABRAHAM is a true-life, feature length film that is very interesting, educational and entertaining. It's a definite keeper for any home or church DVD library or for any epic DVD collector.

621575,5,6303257828,"Abraham is a 1994 television movie based on the life of the Biblical patriarch Abraham. It follows the tale of humble shepherd Abraham as he leads his flock to the Promised Land despite great danger. When the voice of God himself tells Abraham that he must lead his family and a group of like-minded believers on a harrowing journey to the Promised Land, the travelers' faith is tested as they face famine, death, and war at every turn. Through all of their hardships, Abraham's flock is determined to make the journey no matter what the cost.

621760,4,6303257828,THIS ACCOUNT PRETTY WELL STICKS WITH THE WORDS FOUND IN THE KJV BIBLE. EXCELLENT MOVIE TO AD TO YOUR COLLECTION.,1389744000,,112,4.65
621761,4,6303257828,"This inaugural miniseries in the TNT Bible Collection is probably the best film you will find on the Abraham story from the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew and Christian Bible. Richard Harris is really good as Abraham, the ""father of many"" who is the spiritual ancestor of Jews and Christians and Muslims. Barbara Hershey is sympathetic as his wife Sarah and Maximilian Schell and Gottfried John (""GoldenEye"") lend good supporting work. Unfortunately, long stretches of the film are dull and depict the story in a pedestrian way, with too many leisurely scenes of desert life that lend the film an uneven pacing. The screenplay doesn't offer an entirely linear interpretation of the relevant chapters in Genesis, offering historical context that is sometimes helpful and sometimes unnecessary. Scenes like God speaking to Abraham are done very well, but other divine manifestations like the visit of the angels to Abraham and destruction of Sodom are done in a hokey special effects fashion, giving us the most obvious literal interpretation rather than the truly creative renderings done in some other films of this series. Nevertheless, the film's leads are compelling and it offers a highly authentic depiction of ancient shepherd life, giving us impressively detailed recreations of animal sacrifice and covenant rituals. Indeed, sacrifice is at the heart of this story, with several animal sacrifices leading up to the beautiful climax of the near-sacrifice of Isaac. This final sequence, beginning with God asking Abraham to give up what he loves most, is deeply moving and worth the price of purchase alone. Even if one doesn't watch this entire film regularly, it contains excellent individual scenes, and the final sacrifice scene is worth showing in a class or Bible study to capture the essence of Abraham's story. Like all films in the TNT Bible Series, this film is an international co-production marked by authentic Morocco locations and lush filmmaking. Unlike many hokey low-budget religious films, the films in this series are products of first class filmmaking craftsmanship, and they are always believable even when they are a bit dull or fall short of the big-budget spectacle of classic Hollywood Bible Epics. This one is worth a look if you want some help visualizing the little-filmed story of Abraham in a way that stays faithful to the source text.",1387065600,5,2371,5.161038961038961

621935,5,6303257828,"I don't know where to start except to say I absolutely loved this movie.  Richard Harris was wonderful as Abraham.  They portray Abraham as a strong leader and a man of God. He was positive and always obeyed God. He did not question when God told him to pickup, take his family and leave his father's house. It takes a strong faith to start over in another land.

The writers did a lot of research and this movie is very close to the Bible.  This movie is full of talented actors & actresses.  They all played their parts well.

I was especially touched by Abraham and Isaac.  Abraham trained his son well.  He explained why Isaac was to sacrifice the best to God.  Isaac did it without question.

In the scene where Abraham & Isaac were walking up the mountain
and Isaac made the comment there were no animals at that altitude
so where were they to find a sacrifice to God.  It was only when Abraham took out the rope that Isaac realized ""he"" was the sacrifice.  He had seen the rope many times when they sacrificed an animal. I
know this story but I couldn't stop crying when Isaac said to his father it was ok he understood. I wonder how we would do in that situation. Would our faith be as strong as Abraham?

I've always loved Richard Harris. He has played some brilliant roles but he was exceptional as Abraham.

We teach a 2nd grade class at church and we show them bible movies.  The children don't care for the animated stories they like the real movies. We have shown them several movies and they have learned many things we had studied in our lessons.

The children have told us the movie makes it ""real"" for them. They
can see the things in their books. In the movies they see how people dressed in those days, how they lived and what their homes were like and how they worshipped God.

I must mention that we preview ""every"" movie before we show it.  As teachers of God's word it is important that everything we teach them is according to the Bible. Just because a movie is labeled as a ""bible movie"" does not make it by the Bible and it's teachings.

This is one of the best bible movies I've seen.  This is a great movie for both children and adults.",1353628800,9,2165,4.311881188118812
621936,5,6303257828,Very faithful to the biblical story of Abram/Abraham. The acting is excellent. One of the two or three best biblical based movies that I've seen.,1350777600,,145,4.84
621937,5,6303257828,"This DVD stays right along the way It is writen in the NIV! I thought the filming of the region was the ""Best""! Abraham (Richard Harris ) Is Just the Best! Not only the lines He says but the way He uses His Body actions!
Sharah was a prefect match for Him! I can't imagine handing My husband to another woman to have "" make Love"" to get Her pregnant because You haven't conceived! Yet,This DVD makes it just like it was! Sharah was in her 60's & waited a baby! but She was so mean to Hargar &  treated Her girl servant like She hated Her, When She was asked to be involved with Abraham Hagar was good enough Sharah was 65 & too old to conceive? But because She was so cruel Hagar ran away !However She met a Angel who told her  She needed to return!) She was going to have Ishmael! He will be as strong as a ""Wild Donkey""!His  hand will be against everyone & everyone's hand will be against Him! When Ishmael was born Abraham was 86 years old!  He said When Abraham was99 years old  the Lord appeared  To Him & He Commanded ! Lord said ""I am the Lord Almighty Walk beside Me & be Blameless! I will confirm My covenant between Me & you & You will greatly increase Your Numbers!
Abram fell facedown & God said to Him I will confirm My covenant You will be the Father of Many nations. No Longer will You be Abram but Your name will be called Abram: Your Name will be called Abraham! As the father of many nations I will make You very fruitful!
But this is My convenant with You,You willKeep Every male among You to be circumcised ! & all Your Decescendantsfor all generations 8 days old little boys need to have this done! than He has the 3 angels appear & They tell Abraham next Year They will be back & Sharah will have a SON! Sharah was making bread & She heard this & laughed! I will bless Her so She will be the Mother of all nations! Kings of people will fall before Her! Sharah was 90 when Isaac! She did laugh & the Lord said Yes,You did!
Than They went through the Story of Sodem & Gomorrah & how evil the people were! Abraham started at 50 & went down to 10 good men if They lived there He wouldn't destroy them! We all know Lots wife disobeyed & did look back & was turned into a pillar of salt!
Of course We know the story He had to destroy the town because everyone in it was so evil with sin there was no way of changing them! Almost like our Country today!
Of course Lot & his wife & 2 girls were caution several times ""DO NOT LOOK BACK?was the LAST WORDS THAT WERE SAID SEVERAL TIMES BUT LOTS WIFE DISOLBEYED! It is a good DVD to have Your Children to watch as soon as You have explained the part Abraham played as the"" Father of ALL Nations!"" He was  a Man who Truly loved Our Lord &  really did not care what He had to do(even if We would find it easier to not be totally honest! Yet,His ""Strong Self disipline"" Man WHO WANTED to do above & Beyond What Was ""RIGHT""! Nothing was MORE important or comes second to His GOD!They put more verses of the bible in there ! But what I appreciate it is because my grand children watched it with them! The God almighty does not take disobedience & refusual to admit it is disobedience (AS it is so east to do especially in the middle 80's on! Actually,it started in the seventies because it was so bad I had to pay for Christian education! Now,depending on where You live there are many things that has caused Drugs,divorce,lack of committment to jobs or anything else!
However,I loved the way this movie stayed with with the Bible a lot!",1348099200,,3492,4.140117994100295
621938,4,6303257828,"A stirring and engaging story of Abraham's life with excellent casting, dialogue , cinematography and scenery.
Belonging in Haran about ten minutes before Abram's scene of smashing the idols which is taken from the Jewish Midrash, it casts Richard Harris as a thoroughly human, humane and wise Abram's successfully capturing his inner struggles and communications with G-D, and an attractive Barbara Hershey as the beautiful and thoughtful Sarah. Maximilian Schell plays a engagingly corrupt and hedonistic Pharoah.
Takes us from Abram being command by G-D to leave the land of his birth, his journey to Canaan, his encounter with Mamre at Hebron and his purchase of that region, his journey to Egypt where the Pharaoh tries to take Sarah as a wife, believing her to be Abram's sister, Abrams' role in the war of the four and five kings to rescue his nephew Lot, where Abram takes the role of a general, the destruction of Sodom, the birth of Abraham's sons. And the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmmael by Abram at Sarah's urging. Brilliantly captured was the rivalry between Sara and Hagar after Hagar becomes pregnant with Ishmael. Excellent depiction of Melchizedek King of Jerusalem's meeting with Abram.
If fault can be found with this movie it is the fact that since the writers are aware of the Midrash they could have focused on Abram's discovery of the true G-D as child, and that he was considerably younger than portrayed when he smashed his father's idols. Also towards the end of the movie Ishmael is not shown as the 'wild ass of a man; who ruthlessly persecuted Isaac that he was, and Sarah's urging to send Ishmael away seems less justifiable when the movie portrays Ishmael as such a nice, clean cut boy. Furthermore Isaac was older when he was put uf for sacrifice by Abraham than he is depicted in this movie",1346803200,2,1823,4.827476038338658

621981,2,6303257828,"My sons and I just finished watching this movie (mom went to bed she was so disappointed with it) and we are really disappointed with the first hour of this movie, which seems totally made up. We LOVED the movie ""Joseph"" by the same producers, and were so impressed that we were looking forward to this one.

What impressed us about Joseph was that it is ""more real"" in the words of my youngest son, by which he means that the stuff in the movie is actually in the Bible. In contrast, it seems like the goal in ""Abraham"" was to stretch 10 bible verses into an entire hour...and the stories they made up were slow and boring anyway!

The Bible is exciting enough all by itself (e.g. Joseph). Perhaps, the producers have learned this lesson, since ""Joseph"" is more recent.

I have to admit, I was so excited about this series after seeing ""Joseph"" that I was ready to buy the entire collection. Now, when even eight and ten year olds are annoyed by so many ""made up"" parts, I will act more slowly.

For example, their impression was so bad that my older son was saying, ""they'd better not leave out the sacrifice of Isaac part."" Fortunately, they didn't leave it out!

I was particularly disappointed in the portrayal of God's covenant with Abraham. The Bible gives a rich description of the formal ceremony that took place. This was completely omitted; and the producers do not have the lame excuse that it had to be cut for the sake of time...they clearly preferred their 'made up stories' to the actual Bible stories.

In summary, we rate the first half the movie ""1"" and the last half of the movie ""3-4"" so we gave it a ""2.""",1283644800,8,1626,4.439597315436242
621982,3,6303257828,"I'm surprised by all the 4- and 5-star reviews of this film. I bought it for possible use in teaching my 11th-grade scripture class at a Catholic prep school, but it's much too long and slow, even for me.

The film is fairly faithful to the biblical text and, in three hours, covers almost the entire story of Abraham (Genesis 12-22), with just a few understandable omissions, like the second story about Abraham's passing off Sarah as his sister (ch. 20). The film begins with about ten minutes of background that isn't in the biblical text, giving a sense of the cultural and political situation in Haran at the time and introducing the main characters.

The acting is fine, but the film is just too drawn out and boring. If it were edited down to two hours, I might give it 4 stars. The only excerpt I might use in class is the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac (about ten minutes). Besides that, I'll keep using excerpts from the delightful half-hour claymation film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abraham/dp/B0000AYL2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abraham</a>"" from the series ""Testament: The Bible in Animation.""",1279929600,3,1154,5.198924731182796

This story was more accurate than what I had pictured in my head as I read the scriptures. They got some of the points that I have always overlooked.

Richard Harris was a good choice to play Abraham. This portrayal made me wonder just how much Abraham really confided in Sarah, as much as they showed here? The 'battle' between Sarah and Hagar was cut short here. It would have been impractical to do it any other way. I also hadn't realized that Hagar came on the scene after they were sent from Egypt. The story of why Sarah wanted Ishmael and Hagar sent away was a little different than I had remembered.

This film does pretty well with the actual Biblical account, and it's rather inspiring spiritually because of it.  Pretty rock solid, actually.  We would like to say BUY this one, without question it's worth it, but do to the exception below we cannot!

The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will ever approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

621988,3,6303257828,"For those viewers who are mainly seeking entertainment, I can see where this film would appear a little dragged out. The entire series of the Bible Collection has Biblical issues, but this film is more accurate then most. I was caught off guard when the film suggested that as a mature married man Abraham knew nothing our true God, and the next scene showed him telling the children the oral history of God from the beginning to his present time. The movie does have a few things out of order, but it is a very well made movie, considering it came out of Hollywood. I would, and have shown this movie to all of my 11 grandchildren, regardless of age. I believe it is important to tell your children everything about our lord, so they will not relate him to secular, fun loving characters they are bombarded with, like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.",1261526400,59,852,4.503225806451613

622059,5,6303257828,"This is the first movie I've ever watched based solely around the life of the Biblical patriarch Abraham, and I have to say that I was not disappointed in the least bit. Richard Harris does an amazing job as Abraham, and brings him to life as I've never seen before on screen. I felt he made him human and gave him a personality, something lacking when you go to church sometimes. I also felt that the others in the movie helped to give this movie life and made it very interesting. Not only is the acting in this movie top notch, but the actual setting was very inspiration too. It really brought you into the time that Abraham would have lived.

I have to say that this movie is pretty good when it comes to Scripture too. It doesn't just go over the main parts of the story, it has the less often told parts too. I felt that really put this movie above others because of that.

622064,5,6303257828,Richard Harris was extra-ordinary.  The video provided insight to Abraham's and Sarah's character.  We often think that the Bible characters were in constant contact with God and that they always felt His presence.  This shows us that there were times when Abraham (beloved of God) also felt alone and even perhaps abandonned.  The video accurately portrays the many facets in a relationship with God.,1200700800,4,401,5.21875
622065,4,6303257828,"This film offers a serious, respectful and well made treatment of the Bible's story of Abraham. It starts with Abraham being told by God that he should seek out a new land where ""I will make you into a great nation"". The movie ends with the scene of Abraham offering his son, Issac, as a sacrifice to God. It was shot on location in the Middle East, features some fine acting from Richard Harris and Barbara Hershey and possesses a reasonably high degree of historical accuracy.

However, viewers should keep in mind that many scenes included in this film do not come from the Bible itself. But are instead fictitious stories made up by the filmakers. The chronology of biblical events is also switched around and certain details are changed. For example, in the movie Eliezer from Damacus is given an expanded role as a man Abraham discovers dying of thirst in the desert while trying to escape from slavery. Eliezer then becomes Abraham's closest friend and confidant.  However, in the the Bible Eliezer receives only a passing mention - as a household servant who Abraham is worried will inherit his estate if he dies childless. I could offer many more examples where the movie differs from the biblical account.

To some extent this is understandable because the Bible's story of Abraham is quite short, with the first hour of the movie drawn from only a single page of biblical text. However, I would have preferred that the film have shortened it's length from over 3 hours to 2 hours or less in order to follow the biblical story more closely. I am not saying this because I am a biblical literalist. Actually, my interest in religon is more intellectual than faith based. However, I do believe in preserving the integrity of this important, ancient text which countless people throughout world history have believed to be sacred.

This is still a movie worth watching. But I do recommend that you compare the film's scenes to what actually occurs in the Bible.",1187740800,3,1968,4.762463343108505
622066,4,6303257828,"Joseph Sargent, director of countless TV episodes and movies of everything from `Star Trek' and `Gunsmoke' to the movie `Jaws: The Revenge', does an admirable job of telling the story of Abraham here over 3 hours.  It certainly has an authentic feel to it, but critically it scores plaudits for portraying Abraham in such a human, down to earth and easy to understand way.
Richard Harris heads a starry cast, making us really believe in the reality of a man who became the father of nations.  All the key moments are shown, through from deciding to leave Haran for Egypt, through to the births of his sons Ishmael and Isaac, and the final altar scene with Isaac.  This is an apt place to end, for the underlying theme shown is that of sacrifice and loving God above all.  When sacrificing, Isaac is reminded by his father to `pick the lamb you love the most, for in this way you are showing God you put him before all'.  It is this underlying understanding of the seemingly old fashioned concept of burnt sacrifice that is all too relevant to us today.
For a TV movie, the production values are not bad, and mostly on location - the only let down moment being the destruction of Sodom which is only glimpsed and what we do glimpse is poorly done.
However, the restrained way in which the other key events are shown are very realistic, and the cast all add significant gravitas to proceedings.  Other key performers are Maximillian Schell as the Pharaoh - surprisingly effective, and Barbara Hershey as Sara, Abrahams wife.

These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told. Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs, never the less, it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be, for the most part, some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film, with or without a big budget. My favorite is the story of Abram, the movie Joseph coming in a close second along with the movie, Moses, coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph. All of the rest of these movies hoover in second or third place together as far as I'm concerned. Bravo bravo - Please make more!

622105,5,6303257828,"I think that this was the first movie made for the Bible Collection. It set a high standard for excellence in terms of presenting a dramatic story and in terms of presenting material from the bible. Most often, when one of these aspects succeeds, the other fails. In this case, both are done well.

The story is of the patriarch, Abraham. He is called by God to leave his home and settle in a new area. He is promised that he will become the father of many nations. Throughout his sojourn, there are times when his faith or that of his followers falters. At these times, they will do things other than what they are commanded by God and generally have problems result from it. In the end, the promise is made good even though both Abraham and his wife are well past the age where these promises would seem realistic. God keeps promises.

The other impressive thing about this presentation is the way it works in a host of details from the biblical story that are rarely dealt with. Since the story of Abraham is not one of the most popular for depiction, this may not be apparent to some but I noticed details which seldom make it into sermons or Sunday School presentations.

The whole, though, is greater than the sum of the parts. It is an excellent account.",1170201600,4,1261,4.45021645021645

Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible.

622111,5,6303257828,"This is one of my favorites in the Turner series of the Bible.  Richard Harris is outstanding as Abraham, and Barbara Hershey does a marvelous job as Sarah.  The depiction is for the most part accurate to the Bible.  There are some depictions that were interesting interpretations and/or different from the biblical account: Abraham hears the audible voice of God in his own voice; the sin of the Sodomites against Lot is connected with inhospitality rather than their sexual immorality; the afflictions that God gave to Pharaoh on account of Sarah was abbreviated to one instance. Sometimes Abraham looks like he is in a trance where he hears God's voice.

Some of the best scenes were:  God and the 2 angels appearing to Abraham and announcing to Sarah that she will bear Isaac; the angel of the Lord ministering to Hagar on her escape to Egypt, and the closing scene of Abraham's ""sacrifice"" of Isaac and God's intervention and covenant promises.

That aside, I was really moved by this film.  It was great to see how God stood by His covenant to Abraham, how He appeared and spoke to Abraham on various occasions, and how He helped Abraham through his trials in Egypt, his problem with Hagar, and affirmed His promises to Abraham after he passes the test in Mount Moriah.  The biblical story of Abraham really came alive for me. I think this adaptation, along with ""Joseph"", are the best in the Turner Bible series.

622113,5,6303257828,"Richard Harris is brilliant as Abraham, strong as well as tender, and with the ability to convey emotion so  perfectly in his voice that it's a performance that can be enjoyed by just listening to it.
It covers Genesis 11:27 through Chapter 22:17, and stays fairly close to the scripture,
though there are a few omissions, and some additions to fill out the film; I especially like Abraham teaching Ishmael and Isaac, in separate scenes, the principles of the sacrificial rite. Christians will appreciate that Isaac was one of the ""types"" that run through the Old Testament pointing to Jesus.
Among the other changes/additions are the shifting of the meeting with Melchizedek (Ch. 14), to after God makes a covenant with Abraham to give him the land of the ""ites"" in Ch. 15 (Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, etc );  Lot offering himself as well as his daughters to the people of Sodom as a substitute for his guests, and also in this film Lot is the one that suggests he separate his family and flocks from Abraham's, instead of the other way around.
Abraham was 75 when he started his immense journey of faith, and there are scenes where he talks and listens to God that are wonderful.
This would not be a good film for children however, as it is not a colorful film, with the sets and costumes all in earth tones, and there are many animals that suffer a bad fate, either from the famine that takes place in the early part of the film, or the sacrifices.
The cast is splendid, with Barbara Hershey excellent as the beautiful Sarah, as is Carolina Rosi, who makes a stunning Hagar. John Gottfried plays Abraham's faithful steward Eliezar, and two venerable international actors have smaller roles, Vittorio Gassman as Terah, and Maximillian Schell as Pharaoh.
