The Yuan Dynasty wants to replace him with one of their own since he has no heir.  The King has his wife the Queen and the Chief - Hong Lim - of his personal guard called the Kunryongwe. He is in in love with Hong Lim.  Hong Lim is in Love with him.  The King needs an heir and has no interest in producing one to save the kingdom.  He ""suggests"" heavily that Hong Lim do the deed to give him an heir because he will want his son to look as fair"" as Hong.  Hong falls in love with the Queen,  The Queen falls in love with him.  In additional there is much political intrigue and bloodshed.  The story is really about Hong-Lim and his conflicts with his loyalty and love of the King and his growing feeling for the Queen.  The bittersweet scene is when they look upon each other for the last time.  The film is extremely well done and worth having as part of your collection.  I give it a five plus.",1406160000,5,1064,4.116504854368932

I cant say enough good things about one of my favorite movies.  Not for viewers that object  to nudity or graphic sex.",1406160000,,282,5.363636363636363
4597004,5,B0057M95KM,"i love movies that are not afraid to center around complex stories that bend sexual barriers - this is one of them. Extremely well done, well acted and with a captivating story - I had to buy it after watching it several times. It's also one of the few Korean movies I've watched that ventures in several directions at once: historical drama, love story, sexual conflict (explicit but necessary to tell the story)

Not for the prudes.",1394928000,,434,4.636363636363637
4597005,4,B0057M95KM,Really enjoyed this movie. Had seen parts of it on TV was anxious to see all of it. Thank you for sending it so quickly.,1394323200,,120,3.84
4597006,5,B0057M95KM,"If you are sexually prudent or homophobic this is not the film for you.  If you are open minded, love beautiful cinematography and lavish settings, not to mention amazing acting then this is the perfect film for you.  The story is a fictionalized version about a historic king and his love for his private guard chief.  Meanwhile he has a beautiful and lonely Queen who is in the sad position of having to provide an heir to the throne. The King is incapable of having sex with a woman so he orders his lover and the Queen to consummate in order to provide this heir.  What ensues leaves the king feeling suspicious, betrayed, and vengeful.  The sword fights are amazing, the emotions are raw, the violence and graphics are stunningly believable.  I watched this movie online in parts and decided I just have to own it!",1394236800,15,819,4.575342465753424
4597007,1,B0057M95KM,"I was very disappointed. The movie had excellent costumes, scenery and sword fighting scenes. However, the very explicit sexual scenes (man/man, man/woman) were way too graphic and completely un-necessary to the drama. Unless you are into porn don't waste your money on this film.",1391212800,6,280,5.386363636363637
4597008,5,B0057M95KM,I haven't finished it because of my schedule but it is so captivating as long as the subject matter doesn't turn you off. The acting is pretty good and the dialog is fine (subtitled). I would definitely suggest it.,1381363200,4,214,4.512820512820513
4597009,5,B0057M95KM,This movie was excellent.  The entire story line blew me away.  The costume Design was marvelous.  It had me completely shocked.  I would most definitly recommend this movie.,1374451200,3,174,5.107142857142857
4597010,4,B0057M95KM,"A visually sumptuous feast in the vein of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The House of Flying Daggers, with a unique story.  I started watching this film with low expectations, but it sustained my interest without lapse.  It was a fascinating study of court intrigue, and relationships in the context of the absolute power of a feudal ruler at a repressive time.  I had empathy for each of the 3 main characters, and the imagery left an indelible impression.  The ending was high melodrama with a Shakespearean prolonged death sequence, but was nevertheless well executed.  Highly recommended if you like nuanced drama.",1362614400,16,622,5.0588235294117645

4597013,3,B0057M95KM,"I did like the movie, although the explicit sex was unnecessary. Sad though, that the homosexual man was a conflictive man, he did plot the sexual encounter between his man and his queen, although at the end he felt betrayed. Also sad to portrait a homosexual as extremely needed for love. I don't know if that is the case with all homosexuals, although this movie for me just shows the stereotypical homosexual conflictive and dramatic.",1502841600,,437,4.84

Its definitely not for the close minded. Jo In Sung is fantastic and his relationship with the other characters in the film is well acted and intriguing.

8460877,5,B0057M95KM,"what an amazing movie. complicated subject matter of love between 2 men and a woman handled very maturely and without apology. as S. Korea society typically shuns same sex love, this movie certainly turns their archaic thinking on its head. bravo!  nice cinematography, believable acting, great costumes. if you're an art film lover, this is the film for you. if not, this may not be the right film for you.",1518652800,,407,4.814285714285714

8460883,5,B0057M95KM,"This film is my all time favorite of all Korean films. The fictional king who ""raises"" 36 boys to be his loyal guard is the definition of a pedifile. He chooses Hong to be his right hand and lover. I was a history education major so the plot was especially interesting to me.  Jo In Sung is a fine actor in this and his other dramas. He was perfectly cast as loyal Hong. The haunting and beautiful soundtrack with the sad cello solo during their love scenes broke my heart and the Queen's song, a Goryeo folk song, Gashiri is a personal favorite. Most memorable line: ""You lead me to love, and I couldn't be more grateful.""",1506124800,3,623,4.3247863247863245
