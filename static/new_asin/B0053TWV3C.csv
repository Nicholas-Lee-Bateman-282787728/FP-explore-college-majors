8455715,5,B0053TWV3C,"This one is chock full of goodies. I was particularly happy with watching Red Rock West for the first time ever, a film that never got the box office that it really deserved. Also, Leeson's Under Suspicion was a great, though largely unscored film. And Justice for All, Absence of Malice, Jagged Edge, A Soldiers Story and The Deep round out the fare. This is one set of movies that's got everything you could ever ask for in acting, directing and general good viewing pleasure.",1412121600,,478,4.635294117647059
8455716,4,B0053TWV3C,"Ten thrillers, all from Columbia. Enjoy them one by one or two by two.

THE DEEP
Looking for morphine and a Spanish treasure in the sea around the Bermudas. Sharks added, but they are just nice friendly meddlers.

JAGGED EDGE
A crime of money disguised as a crime of passion, jealousy and love in the good rich society of San Francisco. How surprising facts can be when you look at them with a twisted mind.

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL
A classic for sure about American justice: it is all rotten and unredeemable. Too bad for you the young! In prison where you shouldn't be you will be raped and whatever may happen next and you will have to die, . . . because you're innocent. Justice has to justify its existence.

ABSENCE OF MALICE
The case of journalism as the whistle blower about anything, any crime. What happens when the press-accused person is innocent? What happens if the prosecutor is convinced beyond any doubt he is always right? What happens if the accused has the means to repay that press back for the service?

MONEY TRAIN
This one is funny and it is the accusation of bureaucrats when they become endowed with any authority. They are born tyrants and they will die tyrants . . . or in prison.

AGAINST ALL ODDS
The daughter of a rich family is running away from her lover. He hires a football star who is being harassed by some coach out of his team to look for her. The football star finds her in some Maya ruins in Mexico, or near by. She comes back but the other characters of the story do not get it that easy-going free-wheeling way.

TO DIE FOR
Nicole Kidman carries this pale imitation of Twin Peaks, and so many other stories about a town and their hidden secrets, otherwise it would not have gone very far. She is great, that actress who was still very young.

A SOLDIER'S STORY
A nasty racial crime in an all black (private and NCOs) unit in 1944 (all Commissioned Officers are white . . . OF COURSE) brings an investigating captain from Washington. He is black. You can imagine the situation in a small town in Louisiana where they had never seen a black officer before and what's more to investigate a crime in which some white citizens and white officers are suspected. Gosh things can go wrong at times.

 RED ROCK WEST
Hobos, simple moneyless travelers, criminals escaping justice, bounty hunters, hit men and sheriffs, all in the same basket eating one another's faces. All that for what's left of a million dollars. Going in and out of the little city of Red Rock, to finally hit the railroad, Jack, west if possible. There might be one survivor after all.

UNDER SUSPICION
We move to Brighton, England, and a nasty ex-cop turned private investigator cheating with the law to help men get a divorce with some alleged, but fake, adulterous liaison. He liaises all right but two people end up dead and he gets nearly hanged. And the culprit couple manages to get away to Miami, the paradise of serial killers like Dexter. We were in 1959-60. That's more than half a century ago.

Enjoy the films. They are entertaining and distractive, I mean they distract your mind away from serious problems like ISIS and other terrorist crimes like an English citizen beheading an American journalist with a butcher knife in front of an Internet camera.

8455717,5,B0053TWV3C,"I started out to buy ""Absence of Malice"". Looking through the other buying options, I found this collection. It had my movie, plus 9 others. All are well done thrillers, that's for sure. The packaging is a bit odd, but acceptable. Where else can you buy 10 good movies for $ 18.00?",1378944000,5,281,4.423076923076923
8455718,4,B0053TWV3C,"I was looking for a DVD of an old fave movie, THE DEEP, and I found this boxed set of 10 titles. Since the price wasn't much more than I'd expect to pay for the one title, I grabbed it. The 10 movies are from Columbia Pictures from the 1970s-1990s, and they range in quality from excellent (A SOLDIER'S STORY) to terrible (MONEY TRAIN), but most of them are good, solid, 3-star films, and some (ABSENCE OF MALICE, JAGGED EDGE, TO DIE FOR) are old faves of mine. 2 titles, RED ROCK WEST (with Nicolas Cage) and UNDER SUSPICION (with Liam Neeson) were pleasant surprises--I'd never heard of them, but they were both very good.

The complete list: THE DEEP, JAGGED EDGE, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, ABSENCE OF MALICE, MONEY TRAIN, AGAINST ALL ODDS, TO DIE FOR, A SOLDIER'S STORY, RED ROCK WEST, UNDER SUSPICION. 3 titles are rated PG, and the others are all rated R (violence/nudity/sex/language, some much more than others).

My only beef is that some of these films are the dreaded ""pan-and-scan"" versions, not the original widescreen--including THE DEEP, the film I was originally looking for! But at this price, I guess I can't complain. The packaging is interesting (2 cardboard fold-up sleeves with 5 discs in each), but manageable. No jewel cases or poster art (except on the outer box), and all 10 titles are the ""no-frills"" versions--you get the movie, period, which is fine with me, but others might want to buy the titles individually if they want commentary and docs and theatrical trailers, etc. All in all, it's a mixed bag with something for everyone, at a nice price.",1371081600,12,1576,4.706521739130435
