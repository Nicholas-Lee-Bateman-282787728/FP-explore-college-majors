Not really a stand-alone movie, but the characterization is fantastic, far above the depth you get in the tv series before it. This makes it so, even coming in with no prior knowledge, you quickly begin to care about the characters.",1524787200,,368,4.590909090909091

7932865,5,B000056VMF,"As you know I love Macron 1 & feel the need to buy anything related to it.  So when I heard of a movie about what happened after the series I had to see it, & overall I loved it.

If you love Macron 1, you'll love this movie.  But there's something you need to know before watching this, & just so you know it's a spoiler for the series finale, but since it's impossible to find this may be the only way you'll hear about it: At the end Dark Star's generals turn against him & become good guys.  Nathan is revealed to be an alien who can communicate with machines, & takes Macstar with him to his home planet.  That's right; this is a giant robot movie without the giant robot.  Mind blowing, isn't it?  So the movie starts 40 years after the series ended.  Everyone's moved on & is doing well except for Cathy I mean Remy (the Japanese names are different), who's become a hermit.  On her way to a reunion, she gets in a car accident & is in poor shape.  As her friends wait for her, the story flashes back between this time & 2 others; her childhood & when the 6 of them were stranded in a creepy desert town.  It's a very good psychological.  But just remember, this isn't for children.  There's swearing, references to prostitutes (Remy's mother was one) violence & blood even a little bit of nudity (Remy's silhouette as well as a couple seconds of her bare breast during visions) but overall I'd call it PG-13.  Despite that, it's a really good story about what happened after the series, & easily the best anime movie I have ever seen.  I'd even recommend it to people who haven't seen the series, since you don't really need much prior knowledge to enjoy it, as some people have said.",1365465600,4,1692,4.2933753943217665
7932866,5,B000056VMF,"I remember seeing the series it was based on when I was a little kid. I always liked it but it in a sense was a bit of the cliche defenders of the earth vs. super villains/terrorists.

But back in the day Anime was getting popular in my country and one of the titles was this one. I bought it expecting to see a cool action flic but it was very different.

All the main characters from the show are friends and are retired. And when one of them(Remy) gets in a near fatal accident they take a break from their otherwise busy carreers to stand by her when she's laying comatose in the hospital. That and reminis about the good old days.

Meanwhile in Remy's mind she wanders on a strange desert planet and finds out she has to battle one final battle. The battle against death itself. And in that surreal dreamplace she is helped by her old friends/memories.

While the audio and video is very oldschool and not as flashy as modern anime, it makes up in story. It's one of my all time favorites and I reccommend it to everyone who's into dark drama with a good dose of brutal violence.",1125273600,,1084,4.273170731707317
7932867,3,B000056VMF,"Actually thats an unfair thing to say. It isn't Gatchaman, although in many ways it seems like its a progression from it. The story revolves around a former 'Super' team, the 'Goshogun, they were the all round good guys, champions of justice etc. Cat stuck in a tree? never fear. GOSHOGUN is here. Well I imagine thats probably what they were like. The Goshogun are no more, they're all trying to lead their own seperate lives but they are once again draw together when one of their number is injured in a car crash.  From deep in her comatose state the main character 'Remy Shimada' desperately battles at a subconcious level, in a dark and forboding town. Should she and her team fail, then she might never wake.
So thats the overview, in many ways its a lot better than it sounds, its not at all cute, the fighting and weapons especially are quite realistic and brutal in style. For the majority of the film you're left in a half confused limbo, bits make sense here and there but not all of it.
Definately one to rent or to see, it wouldn't be my first choice as a purchase but good if you're fed up with all singing all dancing....",992390400,2,1136,4.40952380952381
