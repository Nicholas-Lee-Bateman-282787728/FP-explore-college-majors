Wished this had been a more professional video as I am looking for something to show middle or high school students as an introduction.  Video seemed very dated, poor cartoon like recreations of times past, video of 10 year old students looking at fossils, and very simplistic explanations about fossils and didn't even explain the different types of fossils well.  Covered Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.  For evolution I'll stick with the BBC series ""Before the Dinosaurs, Walking with Monsters, and the rest of that series (""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts,"" ""Walking with Dinosaurs,"" and ""Walking with Cavemen."")  My search for a good film for students on fossils and Carbon 14 dating continues.",1290297600,,848,5.338345864661654
