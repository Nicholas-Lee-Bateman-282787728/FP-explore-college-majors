4989165,5,B006H3KQU8,"First, I am a HUGE Rundgren fan, 45 cds, 5 dvds, and counting.
""Todd"" is probably my personal favorite Rundgren album, though it's so hard to pick A favorite. I went to see the AWATS tour with my son but missed the TODD tour when it was around. This dvd helps make up for that. Great sound, although you really have to turn up the volume compared to most other dvds. I found that the PCM Stereo setting sounded better than the 5.1 for whatever reason. I enjoyed the camera angles MOST of the time. However Jesse Gress gets slighted on a couple solos where the camera curiously shows Prairie Prince or Todd.
The performance is brilliant by all, much more dependent on guitar than what AWATS was. Todd's voice is, obviously, not what it was in '74 but he still knows how to sing and , thus, pulled off the vocals quite nicely. With the exception of ""In and Out of the Chakras We Go"", all other tunes from the original album are performed. Favorites for me were ""The Spark of Life"" (insanely great 'vocal'), ""Everybody's Going to Heaven/King Kong Reggae"",""Number One Lowest Common Denominator"", ""Izzat Love""' and ""Heavy Metal Kids"", but none of them are any less than great. Todd can still rock the guitar, Prairie Prince plays a fine drums (and tap-dances,too), Jesse Gress is also one heluva guitarist, some great Bobby Strickland horns, Kasim plays some great bass guitar, EVERYBODY besides Prairie plays keyboards at one time or another. Great 70's clothing, drumkit, instruments. Great fun.
A wonderful bonus is a 90-minute Roy Firestone interview of Todd. I normally would think ""90 minute interview - how boring"", but it's great, and it's just Part One. Part Two, I assume, will be at the end of a future TR dvd.
Todd Rundgren fan?? Oh yeah, you want this.",1330732800,6,1760,4.662379421221865
4989166,5,B006H3KQU8,"In 1967 a new pop-wunderkind rolled out of Upper Darbey on the edge of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with a psychedelic garage rock band that was going to be the answer to The Beatles and The Who. The band was called Nazz and their first self titled album, though hardly a commercial success, would deliver two of their best songs, ""Open My Eyes"" of which the flip side was ""Hello It's Me"". ""Open My Eyes"" was the song the record company pushed, but a Boston DJ named Ron Robins accidentally played the ""B"" side one night and ""Hello It's Me""  became a number one hit at WMEX in 1968. Several weeks later it was on the playlist of Boston's other Top 40 radio station WRKO and eventually at other stations across the country.

After a trip to England in `68, the band was back in the studio to cut their second album whose original title was to be Fungo Bat. The project was an ambitious project, planned as a double album. When the record company initially signed the group, they dressed them up in Beatles hair cuts and Mod fashions and marketed them along side The Monkees as a hip, tennybopper band. In hind sight, the look was two or three years out of date, and the main creative force, Todd Rundgren, was not to be restrained musically. Instead of American pop songs in the mode of The Beatles, Fungo Bat was full of piano-based Rundgren material, heavily influenced by singer/songwriter Laura Nyro.

Heavily cut down, the album was eventually released as Nazz Nazz. The album flopped and Rundgren left the group soon after. In 1970 Rundgren formed a quazi-band called Runt, which consisted of Rundgren on guitars, keyboards & vocals, assited by Hunt Sales and his brother Tony on drums and bass. In case you are wondering, these were comedian Soupy Sales kids. Rundgren also was the producer. For Rundgren cultists, the self titled album, Runt, is considered Rundgren's first solo work. Upon its release in June 1970 the critics were divided. but the fans weren't  and ""We Gotta Get You a Woman"" became a hit single. The record runs the gamut on musical styles from blues-styled guitar workouts (""Birthday Carol"", ""Broke Down and Busted"") to power pop (""Devil's Bite"", ""Don't Tie My Hands"") to Laura Nyro-styled piano pop (""We Gotta Get You a Woman"", ""Baby Let's Swing"", ""The Last Thing You Said"") to rock 'n' roll (""Who's That Man"") to piano ballads (""Believe in Me"", ""Once Burned"", the middle section of ""Birthday Carol""), as well as including more experimental numbers and first displaying Rundgrens  sarcastic tendencies and  prog-rock leanings on  ""I'm in the Clique"", ""There Are No Words"".

Despite Rundgren's never settling on one style, or maybe because of it, he became extremely successful and developed a cult following which was cemented by Something/Anything? in 1972 and featuring the top 20 U.S. hits ""I Saw The Light""  and an up tempo remake of the Nazz near-hit ""Hello It's Me"", which reached #5 in the U.S.. By this point in time (Rundgren had started experimenting with drugs) his broad mastery extended beyond multiple instruments to production, engineering and the use of computers.

By the time he did the 1974 album Todd he had been dubbed ""Rock's Renaissance Man"" by Rolling Stone .  Todd , performed here in its entirety for the first time live since its release, is considered by some as his best album. It showed his growing interest in the synthesizer, and its ability to expand the textures of rock music. Much of the album is intensely experimental. However, it is not without its share of pop songs. Todd also tinkers with the synth-heavy progressive sound he would take further with his later band Utopia. Rumor had it that Rundgren and his record label fought over the release of the song ""Izzat Love?"" as a single. The artist insisted the song was indicative of a music style he no longer wished to pursue, and Rundgren won under threat to never record again should the song be released. Another indication of Rundgrens wish to explore and include in his `style' many musical elements was the inclusion of ""Lord Chancellor's Nightmare"" which is a cover  of a Gilbert & Sullivan song from their 1882 comic-opera ""Iolanthe"". His biting sarcasm would also shine through on tunes like ""Heavy Metal Kids"".

The filming is out standing and the performance, 37 years after it's last performance, is top drawer.  The band consists of Todd's former band mate from Utopia, Kasim Sulton on bass. The Cars' Greg Hawkes on keyboards, The Tubes Prairie Prince on drums, Jesse Gress (the editor of Guitar Player Magazine) on guitars, Bobby Strickland on sax, and a full choir.

In addition to the concert, which was recorded in Todd's hometown, Philadelphia at the Keswick Theatre, Roy Firestone - the Emmy Award-winning TV personality, interviews Todd for over an hour. It's an informative trip back through time and is not only of interest to the die-hard fan, but is entertaining and funny in places. What becomes clear as you watch the concert interview is that Rundgren, in essences, is  an extremely talented musician, song writer, producer, engineer and also the ""adult rock star"". Throughout his career he never succumbed to the hotel room trashing, groupie collecting clich that many `70s rocker became. And, he never failed to follow his muse, wherever it led him in style and substance.

You'll want to add this to your collection, and also you'll want to visit his vastly entertaining website, Tr-I.Com where this  multi-faceted artists contributions to state-of-the-art music are on display. As a songwriter, video pioneer, producer, recording artist, computer software developer, conceptualist and most recently inter-active artists has made a lasting impression on both the form and content of pop music. he really is A Wizard, a True Star.

4989167,4,B006H3KQU8,"Following a trend chartered by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heart/dp/B000VS6Q6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heart</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brian-Wilson/dp/B000VS6Q6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brian Wilson</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slayer/dp/B000VS6Q6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slayer</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lou-Reed/dp/B000VS6Q6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lou Reed</a>&nbsp;and dozens of others, Todd Rundgren has performed two of his albums live in concert. This DVD (and a separate&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CD/dp/B006UFHHA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CD</a>) documents a September 2010 performance of Rundgren's fifth solo release, the double-album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Todd/dp/B0000032WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Todd</a>, in his hometown of Philadelphia. When originally released in 1974, Todd followed the direction chartered by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Wizard-A-True-Star/dp/B0000032OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Wizard, A True Star</a>, and pointed to Utopia's heavier use of synthesizers. The track list mixed progressive-rock pieces and instrumentals with vocal pop songs, and following the delayed commercial success of ""Hello It's Me"" (recorded in '72, but a chart success in '73), split fan ears between those who enjoyed shorter pop songs, and those who favored longer, more experimental productions.

Without any big chart hits as commercial tentpoles, the album works better in concert than it did on vinyl upon its release. The mix of progressive jams and succinct pop makes for a well-paced show, with the instrumental interludes punctuated by bursts of more easily digested melody and harmony. The material remains remarkably contemporary sounding, particularly the vocal arrangements. Rundgren is terrific, though his vocals are a bit low in parts of the stereo mix. The assembled band includes Jesse Gress, Greg Hawkes, Prairie Prince, Bobby Strickland and Kasim Sulton, and a children's chorus is added for the closing ""Sons of 1984."" There are a few minor hiccups in the staging (this was an early performance in a short tour), but the group is tight and hits some remarkable grooves, such as on ""Everybody's Going to Heaven.""

The 70-minute stage performance was augmented by laser lights and ornate costumes, and professionally taped with multiple cameras (though, disappointingly, in 4:3 rather than widescreen). The audio is available in both stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround. The audience listens rapturously from start to finish, carrying the last song's sing-along refrain for several minutes after the curtain's closed. All that's missing to make this a truly complete album performance is the experimental ""In and Out the Chakras We Go (Formerly: Shaft Goes to Outer Space),"" which was omitted from the tour's set list.

The disc includes a 78-minute interview (part one of two; the second part to appear on an upcoming live DVD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing/dp/B0000032PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing</a>) conducted the night before the performance by super-fan (and sports commentator) Roy Firestone. Filmed in wide-screen before a live audience, Firestone takes Rundgren through his career via videos, photos, album covers, music snippets and Q&A. They alight on notable people, influences and accomplishments, and Rundgren is forthright (even dishy), full of interesting experiences and a natural storyteller. They're an hour into the interview, having discussed Rundgren's extensive work as a producer, before they even get to his own work. This is a terrific package for Rundgren fans, and whether or not Todd is one of your favorite albums, the interview alone is worth the price of admission.

4989181,4,B006H3KQU8,Somewhat disappointing. Not to say the musicianship is lacking. Todd's still is obviously skill there from his very capable keyboards and guitar. The use of so many synth players really does the music justice. I would just say there is something lacking with the warmth and his comfort level with the audience. Its almost as if he is self conscious or somewhat reserved. Particularly his lack of stage direction. Having seen Todd on many occasion there is just something that is definitely missing that's hard to pinpoint.,1350777600,,522,5.011494252873563
4989182,2,B006H3KQU8,"Rather than giving you a history of Todd Rundgren and where the original Todd album fit into his discography, here's an objective review of this DVD.

On the positive side, I love Todd Rundgren, have all of his live DVDs and have seen him in concert countless times. Thiis DVD does a respectable job of capturing the live Todd experience. While i've only watched once, his guitar playing did not seem as sharp as usual, especially when one compares his Last Ride solo on this DVD with the solos on Back to the Bars and the reissued Hammersmith Odeon concert.

On the negative side, I have no choice but to deduct two stars for the video production.  In today's day and age, there is absolutely no excuse for not filming a concert DVD (or any DVD for that matter) in widescreen... especially for a video technology pioneer like Todd.  You can't even find a TV or computer monitor that's not widescreen.  I had the same complaint about Todd's Liars DVD. The full screen production detracts greatly from a great concert experience.

I also had to deduct another star for not including the complete interview with Roy Firestone on this DVD.  Part one was arguably more enjoyable than the concert video footage. It was a truly enjoyable and informative interview. Then, all of a sudden it ended and we were advised the part two would be on a future DVD.  To have to wait and watch the complete interview on two discs is just lame. Obviously, they want me to buy the forthcoming Healing DVD if I want to watch the second half of the interview. Healing was one of my least favorite albums, with the exception of Compassion and Time Heals. But I will buy the DVD if only to see the second half of the interview.  And I'm sure it too will be filmed in 1990's full screen.",1336608000,8,1762,4.498432601880878

4989184,4,B006H3KQU8,"I had always wanted to see this recording live. Back in 1974 being a fan, that was not to be. Surprise, surprise if you are a TODD fan and wanted to see him play live this recording this is a must have, hes not getting any younger, neither are we. This is for the diehard fan that always liked the album and wanted but was not able to see him play the album live. He is a musician not a showman but if what you want is to hear the music played by TODD then get this.",1335484800,,466,3.814432989690722
4989185,5,B006H3KQU8,"In 2010, Todd did a tour playing both his Todd and Healing albums back to back. The short tour was co sponsored by Rundgren Radio (thanks Doug!). This dvd is the first set which features Todd along with Jesse Gress, Greg Hawkes, Prairie Prince, Bobby Strickland, and Kasim Sulton and a children's choir, playing all of Todd minus In and Out the Chakras We Go (Formerly: Shaft Goes to Outer Space) and is also available on cd as a cd soundtrack. The second set of Healing will be released shortly. I actually find the sound quality to be pretty good for the most part. The only thing that I find a little bit lacking is that fact it's pretty much a ""faithful"" retelling of the album without any real variation in the arrangements of the songs. Not that I have a problem with the original arrangements but more of a ""twist"" here and there would've been nice. Still, not to be missed and I'm hopeful that we'll also get the A Wizard and Utopia tours released soon. The DVD also includes the first part of a nice long interview with Todd.",1332633600,3,1034,4.4188481675392675
4989186,5,B006H3KQU8,"Let's stipulate that this item will primarily be purchased by extant Todd fans - the original 1973-74 LP is not by any means his most 'accessible' work, but at its high points was certainly among his strongest and most creative output. If you've never bought a TR DVD, this may not be the best place to start - you may not appreciate what's been accomplished.

It could be argued that the works ""A Wizard/A True Star"" and ""Todd"", taken together, represented an equivalent apex in Todd's career to The Beatles'
""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour"", and I make this point to relate them in terms of their very studio-born nature -- neither lend themselves readily to a live performance in their entirety.

And yet, he (along with his capable and diverse bandmates) pull it off, and do so surprisingly effectively. The original LP had deep and complex layers of both processed traditional instruments as well as synthesizers. and they are reproduced with familiarity - while still providing the spontaneity and ""pop"" of a live performance.

If you loved the LP, you'll absolutely love this DVD.",1331856000,16,1095,4.876344086021505

8498142,5,B006H3KQU8,"As a long time Todd fan, there is, admittedly, a certain degree of bias regarding my appreciation of Todd's work. Regarding the performances, they are exactly what you would expect from Todd, which is as close to perfection as possible in a live environment without the loss of human emotion. The band is comprised of former band members and key musicians from Todd's various group incarnations and the songs, in my opinion, are finally brought to life in a way that only a live performance can deliver. If you are contemplating purchasing this concert then there are a couple of things to consider: 1) Are you familiar with the studio album ""Todd""? 2) Are you interested in watching the first part of a 3 hour interview with Todd and Roy Firestone? If you want the complete package, then buy the ""Healing"" concert when you purchase this one. Both shows were performed on the same day, in the same venue, with the same band. Part One of the interview with Todd is on the ""Todd"" concert, and part Two of the interview is on the ""Healing"" concert. The performances will delight you beyond anything you could imagine by merely listening to the studio albums. The point is that these concerts bring the full blown edition of both studio albums to life including all of the silly Rundgrenisms like ""How about a litte fanfare, fanfare?"" from ""Todd"" and the quirky sound of the ""Golden Goose"" from ""Healing"". These shows are only available on DVD, from what I've seen, but the visuals and the sound will not disappoint you, whether you're new to Todd's music or a seasoned fan of Todd's work. It's difficult for me to separate the two disks primarily because of the interviews and, again, in my opinion, the interviews are worth the price of each disk alone. For those of you who are curious and interested in learning about Todd's career, from his experiences with his early bands to the production side of the coin regarding albums he has produced for himself and other artists, these two concerts present a joyful journey into Todd's music from a live perspective and the dissemination of historical information about the man and his accomplishments.",1430870400,3,2146,4.771505376344086
8498143,3,B006H3KQU8,"Complete performance of his 1974 album Todd, o ok that's the significance. The performance isn't bad, I actually like that album.  The main reason for not being more enthusiastic is the sound - remember that's what it's all about.  It's...ok.  Video is OK but dang for a guy that was so progressive in the field of sound (once upon a time) I have yet to heard any DVD of his that really has stellar sound.  Part of it may be I'm spoilt I've been listening to LCD Soundsystem blu-ray for the past couple of day and this sounds muffled compared to that. But that is an outstanding sounding release.  Not really much from the back speakers this being a front heavy mix.  So if you got to have a hit of Todd and you want a full dose of ""Todd"" (the album) then you should go for it.  If you don't like the album then this isn't going to win you over.  Come on Todd how about Wizard True Star in surround.... Gee you can do better we know you can.",1424304000,,941,4.1602209944751385
