3796736,3,B001U5V03U,"Let's face it: modern operatic productions are now facing a dire crisis in terms of vocal as well as visual standard.
This ROH production has enough vices in respect of both, but frankly speaking, this is by no means the worst.
Vocally, Simon Keenlyside's reprisal of Don G is a failure for himself.
The Champagne Aria simply fails to take off, and the duet with Zerlina too 'creamy', while the Serenade is sorely 'under'.
One misses sadly the Don of Cesare Siepi in that 1950's mono and black and white DVD under Furtwangler. Not one single modern production on DVD came any close to that one, let alone surpassing it.
The only salvage point in this ROH 2008 production is Joyce Didonato's Donna Elvira, the best since Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.
And whoever casts Ramon Vargas as Don Ottavio commits a grave mistake - Vargas is a first-rate bel canto lyrical tenor; not Mozartian tenor. Whatever happened to the Donna Anna in this production, there is surely an understudy competent enough to take her role, especially that this is to be commercially released on DVD!
And the conductor even fails to keep pace with the singers in more than one entry, undoubtedly the result of under-rehersal.  But, why so?
As for the sets, well, suffice to mention that it could be worse.",1248825600,2,1269,4.7681818181818185

Excellent performances, and stage settings.

The real turnoff for me was the stars stripping - DG baring his chest, and he and others taking off their shoes. Why did they do that?

3796738,3,B001U5V03U,"For some reason, this performance is cold. Keenlyside is a fine artist, but no matter how much he strips down, he is not convincing, and lacks charisma. Leporello is also a fake plebeian. The Donna Anna is weak. Joyce Di Donato is an excellent singer, but she is miscast here. Ramon Vargas is the best of the men, as good as anybody ever, and so is Miah Perrson, who does have plenty of charm and plenty of voice. The production itself is boring. I don't recall any other Don Giovanni that has left me with no desire to look at it again.",1245974400,12,537,4.2745098039215685
3796739,5,B001U5V03U,"This is Keenlyside's second performance of DG to be committed to DVD. Overall it is a great performance. But then he (along with Malin Hartelius) justify perchase of the Zurich (earlier) performance: my recollection was that it was relatively inexpensive. The Zurich performance cannot boast of a ""starry"" cast, choosing many regulars for the remainder of the cast. It is also very regie oriented although not as obnoxiously as some of the director's other works, e.g., Peleas and Rosenkavalier.

It is quite interesting to compare SK's two different takes on the anti-hero. In Zurich there is some wit and irony in all that SK does with the role. He would appear to be amused at much of what is happening. In the ROH taping, this Don is demonic, possessed and dangerous. Needless to say in both his singing is beyond criticism. Even at the ROH when is needed (La cidarem, Vieni alla finestra, etc.)it is there. Because of the staging and direction at Zurich the ROH is more memorable if only because it is more conventional in approach. Overall the casting more than trumps the earlier set. I understand that the Anna, Marina Poplavskaya was ill; even so she is still able to triumph over her rival, Eva Mei (Zurich); clips on YouTube, notably from Salzburg allow you to hear her in top form. Joyce Didonato is the Elvira. I don't know when the idea of casting a mezzo for this role started, (Zerlina has also been given this role) but Didonato is very, very good. Even so I miss a soprano in the role. Miah Persson, the Zerlina (deluxe casting) really should have sung the Elvira. Kyle Ketelson is a wonderful Leporello, a superb singing actor. Ramon Vargas turned in a lovely performance of Ottavio. I have never heard him in Mozart and he is clearly up to the challenges of Il mio tesoro. Overall the set has no weak points vocally.

The production is all over the place but is far preferable to Zurich; Zambello must rate very high with the powers that be at ROH. Her recent Carmen was excellent; here she is less concerned with opting for an 18th century period, but mixes conventional period dress with contemporary garb. In this case powered wigs were out and a variation on the mullet was the hair design of choice. While the settings were not particularly evocative of Spain (or any other place) they were preferable to those in the Jacobs' performance.

Highly recommended",1245110400,14,2383,4.7235576923076925
3796740,3,B001U5V03U,"The director, Francesca Zambello, is not working in top form here. She brings to her Royal Opera House DON GIOVANNI more than the rudiments of an interesting visual style, and she certainly shoulders some responsibility for thought about character and theme. But she draws from Simon Keenlyside one of the nastiest, most reptilian and charm-free Dons in my experience, surely her choice more than his, and balances the scales with the platitudes and bromides of a contemporary feminist. Over and over, her blocking emphasizes an idealized sisterhood which crosses class lines, with the three women achieving unity in their victimization and perseverance. A Virgin Mary icon literally watches over this trio of beauties as they bond in struggling against a male-dominated world of abusive brutes (Masetto), unrepentant lechers (Giovanni), and paternalistic patronizers (Ottavio, Commendatore). All three women join hands to wield one weapon against the Don at the close of Act I; Elvira and Zerlina console Anna during ""Il mio tesoro""; ""Mi tradi"" is in part an Elvira suicide attempt prevented by the other two. Elvira appears  radiantly happy in the final scene when announcing her plan to spend the rest of her days in the convent. Of  *course* the Elvira of such a production would be happy about that prospect, both for what she is leaving behind and what she is heading toward: spiritually enlightened sisterhood forever.

None of this is necessarily invalid, and dumber things have been done with this opera, but it is heavy-handed and anachronistic, and not realized with the subtlety and grace that might have gotten it over. Zambello's interest in the women comes at the expense of the men: the Giovanni and Masetto are just unpleasant, while the more genial Ottavio and Leporello seem undercharacterized, stock. Throughout the opera, parts that tend to play awkwardly even in good productions (the Don's slo-mo flight from Anna near the beginning, with Leporello chuntering away in the corner) predictably do so here, but easy parts are also muffed (the Don/Commendatore duel; the Don's escape at the first act finale, here done with a rope in the manner of a rock climb; the first Don/Leporello confrontation with the statue, done without a statue). It is a half-baked, neither/nor GIOVANNI, showing the impulse of ""It's been done so often one way, and I want to do something else"" without that impulse carried through to a thorough, convincing ""something else.""

There are some excellent vocal performances, but that can be said for most DON GIOVANNI DVDs. Most successful are the mezzo Donna Elvira of Joyce DiDonato (a sympathetic and beautifully calibrated acting performance, allied to tight runs and an absolutely seamless voice) and the Leporello of Kyle Ketelsen (vocally wholly agreeable, and well drilled in the standard comedic Leporelloisms to the point of expertise -- but whether his performance has much to do with the production around him, or whether the director's imagination was seized by this character enough to really incorporate him, I am less sure). Also impressive is the Zerlina of Miah Persson, who gets all she can out of Zambello's very sexually liberated and sophisticated take on the peasant girl. The Don Ottavio, Ramn Vargas, gives a characteristic performance: never an actor, but sincerely engaged and likable. He sings the part mellifluously, if not as well as he subsequently would in fall 2011 at the Met (another lackluster GIOVANNI, that one by Grandage). In New York, it seemed to me he had achieved the stature of mature artistry; in  London three years earlier, the long-breathed phrases in the middle of ""Il mio tesoro"" are a bit labored.

If Vargas always seems to be Vargas rather than the character, his basic stage savvy is nevertheless put into sharp relief by the very green Masetto of Robert Gleadow. The latter has a nice voice, but his scenes are hampered by stiffness and diffidence, accompanied by furtive sidelong glances, surprising to encounter in a broadcast performance. No such concerns are raised by Marina Poplavskaya, who throws herself passionately into the production's very black-and-white, unambiguously virtuous and wronged Donna Anna (I did like the detail of the character's mourning veil). Poplavskaya's haunting timbre and compelling presence compensate for the shortish breath line and hit-or-miss fioritura. Zambello shrewdly has the Russian soprano let down her waist-length blond tresses as she prepares to navigate the rapids of the second half of ""Non mi dir"" -- the distraction is welcome. Eric Halfvarson is only a serviceable Commendatore. In the title role, Simon Keenlyside is in rough vocal estate, and portrays a facet of the character (brutality) with zeal and professionalism, while other possibilities are deliberately underexposed.

I find the contribution of the conductor, the late Sir Charles Mackerras, a challenge to review. Speeds are on the fast side, attacks are aggressive, phrasing pushy; the period-style horns rasp away authentically, the timpanist clubs away with his hard sticks, and the overall sonority elicited is thin and watery. It is surely the performance Mackerras was trying to conjure up, it is academically defensible, and I am sure it is the way someone else likes music of this vintage to go. I found it a trial of the nerves, but my preference for the richer and sleeker sounds of, say, Riccardo Muti (especially on his second DVD, the one from Vienna), is a subjective one. What is more clearly problematic is the poor sound balance, every time to the detriment of the vocal soloists. I wondered how this came off in the house, and whether the octogenarian conductor was suffering a not-atypical decline in hearing acuity.

Extra features are very good: a comprehensive behind-the-scenes video tour of the ROH hosted by Deborah Bull (not directly linked to this DON GIOVANNI; the Hytner DON CARLO was being prepared at the time), and five minutes each allotted for music director Antonio Pappano (whom I wish had conducted) to interrogate Mackerras and Zambello. Pappano's questions are better than the inane ones the Met's star singers typically pose to each other on Saturday afternoon movie broadcasts (e.g. ""Is it difficult to go from tragedy to comedy?""), and Zambello is so thoughtful and poised that I wish I had enjoyed the product of her efforts more this time.",1322870400,20,6400,5.170849420849421
3796741,3,B001U5V03U,"I agree with the other review. ""Vocally, Simon Keenlyside's reprisal of Don G is a failure for himself.

The orchestra is just so so. The stage is just OK.

Ramon Vargas meets expectation and excels others.

The best performance is the role of Leporello.

Joyce Didonato was doing her best.

Marina poplavskaya's black dress is beautiful.

The final nude scene was shocked. I guess Don Giovanni was punished that way.

I recommend Muti, Edita Gruberova, Ann Murray and Susanne Mentzer Scala version. Karajan, Samuel Ramey, Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Kathleen Battle Wiener Philharmoniker version is also a good choice.",1320278400,5,784,5.0310077519379846
3796742,5,B001U5V03U,"This wasn't the Don Giovanni I expected to buy, but when I saw the cast I changed my mind. It didn't disappoint. The cast is superb from top to bottom. We particularly enjoyed Kyle Ketelsen who, in addition to having a fantastic voice, showed himself to be a very funny comic actor. The Orchestra is very cleanly recorded. (We were listening to the stereo soundtrack, but via HDMI). Highly recommended.",1312675200,10,402,4.757142857142857
3796743,4,B001U5V03U,"While viewing this, I was not taken with Keelyside, in fact he was a bit repulsive to me.  I later digested it and found it/him to be very effective.  I don't know Keelyside's intention, but I have decided that the repulsiveness was deliberate.  This Don is jaded, burnt out, and bored to tears....but with no other ideas of how to live.  He gets progressively more sadistic and desperate for something, anything, to take and keep his interest. The exceedingly strange encounter with the Commendatore in the graveyard was welcome to him as a tonic for his boredom, and maybe death/hell was welcomed too as a hoped-for final end to it. The director's choice of showing the Don up to his old tricks in hell may not be viewed as consequence by some, but I could stretch my premise to say that forcing the Don to continue his earthly life in hell was an exquisitely well-chosen punishment.

Keelyside's age and stage are perfect for this Don, not really old but certainly not young. Vocally he is not the richest, canny certainly, but not with octaves and power to spare. Even his costume seemed to suggest this view. His same-in-all-acts-costume gave a tattered worn-out impression even before contrasting it with the rest of the aristocrat-principals who were well-groomed and dressed and had several costume changes.

The women all are very effective and Ramon Vargas is a treat in the role of Don Ottavio.  Leporello however didn't engage me vocally or as the character (he did fine, but...nothing special).  He seemed almost too healthy and hearty to be the servant of such a man for the long period of time it appears he has been. Some of the accumulated slime should have rubbed off from the played-out roue that is my view of this Don. Mazetto was OK, but not memorable.  All in all, this performance earns additional viewings for me (not the least to see if my impression holds).",1293753600,8,1884,4.7370030581039755
3796744,5,B001U5V03U,"Having cut my teeth on the Furtwangler film version and over the years enjoyed the Losey and a Glyndebourne video-ed production, with the viewing of this DVD I have to say I have now seen the show of a lifetime, due largely to the superb actor-singers enshrined in this production. That plus the incredibly alive and responsive conducting of the late-lamented Sir Charles MacKerras. I DID note that the balance between the orchestra's sound and singers was not perhaps ideal, but that may depend on personal equipment and certainly can't be blamed on the production in any way. DiDonato is as ever simply the incarnation of the character in both singing and acting, quite a feat with all that melodrama she has to make believable as Donna Elvira, but that is exactly what I believe she does in almost everything I have seen or heard do!! (Still waiting to see that put to the test in the wheelchair Rosina with Florez but her Una Voce in the 2007 Tucker Charity simply steals the show for my money so .....!!).

3796745,3,B001U5V03U,"This was my first opera experience. I could never see the sense in going to an opera without being able to understand the language. :) So I was much depending on the subtitles.

I had researched the available Don Giovanni blurays by reading the reviews to find the one which was the closest to the original (if that is possible), with the best quality video / audio.
I am a former musician, trained in percussion / having played in my early years (10-13) in several local Italian
concert orchestras with much older musicians, an experience that left it's mark on me.
Hence my desire for the best audio experience possible within the limitations of my audio system, which
is connected via optical and supports Dolby 5.1 and DTS.

It was disappointing when the opening D minor chord sounded. I could tell immediately that something was not right and then I noticed the receiver didn't sense either format.

What I hadn't realized, when I researched, was the listing of PCM format.
And the reviews you are reading are not necessarily on the product you are considering. Be very careful
in your research as there are not that many unique Bluray reviews for operatic content and the same reviews appear
on Amazon and across the web for different bluray productions. At $51, it's not as easy to just try another one.
I find this to be misleading and unreliable and I will be more careful next time.

The LPCM 2.0 stereo quality is fine when the receiver decodes it into surround via ProLogic on my system, but if you are connected to the source via optical, you will not experience Dolby 5.1 or DTS. To experience the higher quality LPCM 5.1 audio with this bluray, you must be connected to your audio receiver via HDMI and obviously the receiver must also support the higher quality uncompressed format.

Although it is a great performance, I took off 1 star for lack of additional support for optical DD5.1 and DTS and 1 star for the price.

What I also find strange is, I also purchased Cosi fan Tutte which appears to have been produced by OpusArte in the same year. I was able to listen to that in Dolby 5.1 and the audio quality was excellent!

But I guess it's time to update my receiver.
--------------------

I am including a direct response I received from the OpusArte Authoring House a few days after I wrote the comments above:

In case of discs with 5.1 PCM the BD player/PS3 has to be connected to the amplifier through HDMI or analog 5.1 connection.

If it's connected through SPDIF (which seems to be the case here with your customer) it will be downconverted to 2.0 PCM.

 Cosi Fan Tutte has Dolby TrueHD surround audio and in this case he can enjoy surround sound through SPDIF, but not in full quality - he hears a Dolby Digital version.

He needs to connect his PS3 through an HDMI cable to the receiver to be able to enjoy lossless surround audio offered by Blu-ray.",1279497600,11,2882,4.583657587548638
3796746,5,B001U5V03U,"""DON GIOVANNI"" is one of my two all-time favorite opera's, (the other is ""La Traviata"").  This dvd is one of 7 Don Giovanni's in my dvd collection, and as I
watched it last night, I knew within minutes it would become one of my favorites.
Simon Keenlyside is a brilliant stage actor, as well as a magnificent voice in opera.  He plays this Don Giovanni with a marvelous flair, and is a believable
seducer.  His voice is a joy to listen to.  Miah Persson is probably the best Zerlina I have seen.  Joyce Didonato was a passionate Donna Elvira.
The Spanish Madonna on the stage for much of the opera was a nice touch.  I also appreciate how the director brought forward the bonding of the women characters in
this production~ when Don Giovanni is exposed at the end of ACT I, the women
hold one knife together in their hands and point it at him.  Keenlyside's intensity
is riveting as his character escapes at the end of the scene.
I thought the singer portraying Leporello was fabulous also~ great energy, great voice, and definitely looks like the Leporello one imagines.
Ramon Vargas~ what a voice!  He is a gift to the opera world.  I loved this production, and as I said, of my 7 versions of this opera, this will be the one I return to most often.  My other fav is one with Carlos Alvarez and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo.  Simon Keenlyside brings Don Giovanni to life!  Beautifully!",1271894400,8,1381,4.524193548387097
3796747,5,B001U5V03U,"This is the most completely satisfying video production of Don Giovanni I have encountered to date.  Allow me first to assuage concerns regarding the sound on this Blu-Ray disc -- succinctly put, the LPCM 5.1 sound is impeccable.  The singing, acting, conducting, design, stage direction, and video direction converge ideally with each other to create a jewel of operatic performance.  The result is an as near perfect production of Don Giovanni as I have ever seen (N.B.  The search for such a well-balanced production of Don Giovanni, either in live performance in opera houses around the world or in video productions from film to Beta to VHS to Laserdisc to DVD, has been the ""Holy Grail"" of my opera enjoyment for the past thirty years.  I believe I have found it.)

The set(s)were superb and the finale awesome. But I was shocked from the beginning by the thin, boxy sound of the orchestra; devoid of ambience with no full base, it sounded like a 1950's LP. I kept thinking of Gulini's magnificent 1961 CD. This spoilt the overall enjoyment for me.

8342918,5,B001U5V03U,"Simon Keenlyside is the most reptilian, repulsive, scuzzy Don Giovanni you are likely to meet, and he gives himself totally to Francesca Zambello's conception -- or, more accurately, to the conception that he and Zambello worked out together.  Keenlyside is a fine singer, but here it's impossible to separate the musical from the histrionic effectiveness of this very fine performance.  That sadism and ugliness is made manifest from the start, with the death of the Commendatore -- a good performance by Eric Halfvarson -- which is chillingly intimate, and in which the masked Don reveals himself to the dying man, just before Donna Anna returns to the scene with Don Ottavio.  It's a world of sadists and masochists, and it's interesting that Anna and Ottavio are the ones who resist that dualism.  Marina Poplavskaya's Anna is traumatized by her near, or perhaps actual, rape, but better than Donna Elvira -- well done by Joyce Di Donato -- she resists the siren song, even without the useless gun that Donna Elvira enters with.  She is not to be distracted or won over -- and an unusually virile Ottavio (Ramon Vargas, in good form) backs her to the hilt.  Ottavio and Anna can seem unattractive and life-denying, but not here -- it's the Don who is the Prince of Darkness and Elvira and Zerlina come perilously close to giving him a free ride.  Poplavskaya's singing can seem a little underpowered in places, but it's always musical and dramatically pointed.  Miah Persson is a very fine Zerlina, in this conception, and Robert Gleadow, a name I had never heard, is a strong-voiced, attractive Masetto.  And Kyle Ketelsen is a superb Leporello.

There were some sticky moments in the production.  Like every other one I've seen, Don Giovanni's escape at the end of Act 1 seemed awkward.  Granted, it involved impressive athletic ability by Keenlyside -- luckily he didn't have to sing again until after the interval!  Also, the invitation to the statue seemed awkward -- on my TV screen, I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.  In neither of these scenes were there any musical problems, though.  A very successful scene was Donna Elvira's ""Mi tradi"" scene -- very imaginatively conceived and executed, with Di Donato singing absolutely beautifully.  In fact, that scene highlighted an interesting feature of this production -- how the women joined forces and helped and supported each other throughout, and seemed by the end of the evening to LIKE one another.  Of these women, Donna Elvira was the most in need of help, but the women didn't judge one another, they just helped, no matter the differences of ""class"" or vulnerability.  It was touching and affecting to see them interact, and in particular this focus humanized Donna Anna and contributed to the sense that in this production she is on the side of life.

My TV sound-system isn't the best, but it all came through pretty well.  Mackerras and the Covent Garden orchestra were forceful and spirited.  The direction of the action was detailed to a degree rarely seen in Mozart (and superior to the Met's 2011 version with the rather dainty Marius Kwiecien as the Don).  The sets were undistracting, but not particularly good to look at, but they were mobilized to keep the action moving.  Recitative was handled idiomatically and very effectively.  It all added up to a conception of the opera that made sense, whether or not you agreed with it.  One can imagine more dignified Dons -- but this was the world of sexual predators and women who run with the wolves.  Not a pretty sight, but compelling theater.",1391731200,7,3580,4.866336633663367

8342920,4,B001U5V03U,"There are now several choices available of this opera of which this review considers three contrasting productions. They are the 2008 Royal Opera/Mackerras, the 2001 Zurich Opera/Harnoncourt and the 2002 Aix-en Provence/Harding productions.

The Royal Opera production under Mackerras listed here has received conflicting critical reviews resulting in both enthusiastic and damning comments to be found on Amazon. This also reflects the previous press reviews that accompanied the original performances. The DVD issue is generally more enthusiastically reviewed than the Blu-ray version but for no apparent reason to do with the different format.
This Keenlyside Giovanni figure is portrayed as particularly driven and is the most controversial figure in this production. Importantly, there is no real sign that he actually likes women - surely an essential requirement of a seducer. He is also shown throughout in somewhat sleezy attire - again, seemingly a rather unlikely attraction for the women when initial appearance is likely to be an important key to his success. Don Giovanni's charm therefore seems to be an unimportant consideration of this production. Given these concepts, both the singing and the acting are well done. However, bearing in mind this characterisation, it becomes difficult to believe that either Elvira or Zerlina would fall for such a man although it is obvious why Anna would hate him.

Elvira comes over as rather strident in this production and this particular portrayal of Ottavio as a character is unlikely to be a serious physical threat to Giovanni even though the part is sung well enough. Both Zerlina and Masetto are excellent with Masetto being a satisfyingly stronger character than usual. Both Leporello and the Commendatore parts are well done.

The setting of the opera is loosely in period but there are inconsistencies in staging that have to be ignored if this is to be enjoyed. The final hell-fire is rather tame though and the nude Giovanni apparently happy in hell and holding a naked woman in his arms at the very end seems doubtful as it undermines any idea of retribution. This concluding image of this opera's production is consistent with the portrayal of Giovanni more as a rapist than as a seducer and the ending seems a rather gratuitous use of nudity for non-musical ends.

The orchestral contribution under Mackerras is totally outstanding with every detail making its mark and with good pace throughout. The sound in Blu-ray DTS seems vocally recessed and the volume needs to be turned up several decibels in order to achieve the required bite - then it is OK. This issue gives dramatic and musical satisfaction within marked constraints therefore.

The Zurich production under Harnoncourt also features lively orchestral contributions and a good forward pace. The setting is traditional and does not contain any obviously worrisome inconsistencies as at the Royal Opera above.

Don Giovanni as portrayed by Gilfry has the necessary charm as well as enough youthful vigour. (He portrays the part of Danilo in the Merry Widow, also at Zurich, with much charm too). He is thus very believable as a seducer of women. This therefore adds credence to the roles of both Anna and Zerlina. Sacca as Don Ottavio is in better shape both physically and vocally than Vargas in the Royal Opera production but it still remains rather a weak role - however this is mostly to do with the character as written.

Both Zerlina and Masetto are well performed and convincingly portrayed. Leporello acts and sings well throughout and is a good and strong foil for Giovanni. The concluding scene with a strongly portrayed Commendatore and a markedly more dissolute, long and greasy-haired Giovanni builds well to its fiery end with a clear sense of final terror, but not remorse, clearly communicated by Gilfry. Donna Elvira, as portrayed by Bartoli, is more a matter of personal taste. There are some who find her `over the top' in her acted and sung levels of outrage and stridency. However, taken on its own terms, this is still acceptable and musically spot-on.

The recording is good visually and sonically with clear surround sound (Dolby 5.1) while not quite being up with the latest in high definition technology. Overall, this is preferable to the Royal Opera production simply by not portraying Giovanni in such a deviant manner.

That leaves the production at Aix-en Provence conducted by Harding. This is staged in the most minimalist terms - wooden poles and benches which are moved around to take on different meanings and totally devoid of time or place - intentionally universal therefore but with the message of the essential character types being applied to modern times by means of current clothing. The crucial destruction of Giovanni at the end with such limited means is extraordinarily effective.

The performance is clearly on an outdoor stage at night with dark backgrounds. The stormy weather adds to the drama with hair and clothing blowing in the wind and including real thunder!
The singing and acting throughout is simply superlative by a young and highly skilled team. Peter Mattei as Giovanni exudes charm in abundance coupled with extraordinary physical vigour. Delunsch as Elvira manages to chase hard but avoids stridency - in fact the whole cast is inspired resulting in a truly memorable experience.

The director defends his minimal staging on the grounds that it focusses everything on the drama of the interaction between the characters. It does - and it works. Harding, conducting the fine Mahler Chamber orchestra, keeps a cracking pace and sense of building electricity. The whole thing is well recorded both visually and sonically (Dolby 5.1). This is a terrific performance of considerable musical and dramatic electricity.

I would suggest that the Aix-en-Provence production leads this particular group, followed by Harnoncourt at Zurich with the Royal Opera production being mainly considered here being in third place. This is, without doubt, the most extreme and therefore controversial interpretation of this opera and those aspects will need to be considered carefully if this version is to be considered the finest over the other two briefly considered above.

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

I am less fortunate, being 'plagued' very early on by Furtwangler's 1954 black-and-white DVD with Cesare Siepi as the Don and Ottomann as Leporello, Lisa della Casa as Elvira, Inga Bergman as Zerlina.
The cast is simply unsurpassable..  (U.S. review)

I take your point entirely and generally I try to avoid commenting on such loved mainstays of the catalogue as reactions can be very complex and conflicting!
I would still recommend the Harding version. Many people have found that it really gets to the core - it would certainly give you a benchmark alternative to enjoy and different enough to avoid the issue of 'best'
