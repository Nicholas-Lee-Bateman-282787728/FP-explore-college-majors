8612768,4,B00F6Y3IDG,"George Arliss is at his best as a shoe tycoon who, through circumstances, saves his archrival's company. He's not motivated by greed so much as having a fierce competitive spirit. He also has a romantic side as he takes his former love's children under his wing. The plot has several twists and turns which leads to a hilarious climactic confrontation.

Above all, there's a wonderful chemistry between Bette Davis and Arliss. They enjoy each other's company and are electric on screen. I love Arliss as he thinks his way in and out of situations. His speech to the Hartland salesmen was thrilling.

The only weakness, rather minor, were the scenes where Arliss' nephew and Bette Davis fall in love. I just couldn't see the two of them together, especially since the nephew seemed like a conceited prig.",1523232000,,803,4.854014598540146

8612770,4,B00F6Y3IDG,"Another fine movie starring the elegant British actor George Arliss, a master of screen and stage. His performance is both entertaining and uplifting as he portrays a successful factory owner who, in the troubled times of The Great Depression in the 1930's, is determined to save the children of his fiercest rival from their own self-destruction. This movie was of beatiful quality; nicely remastered for DVD.",1487980800,,410,5.2272727272727275

8612774,5,B00F6Y3IDG,"I am a fan of Bette Davis films. In my opinion, she was one of America's strongest dramatic actresses. Her earlier movies were not all that great but this one I have to say was worth to price. She was endearing and fun but I was overly impressed with the plot, the performances and Mr. Arliss' character and performance. He truly made this movie what it is. I enjoyed everything about the story and look forward to watching it again! For any Bette Davis fan who enjoys a good movie!",1387065600,6,482,4.366666666666666
