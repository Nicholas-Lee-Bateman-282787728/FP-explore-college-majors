Despite I know by heart every scene, every melody, even almost every word (however, in Russian dubbed translation) I always felt excited every time the movie was going on TV channel. When I grew up I considered this Cinderella, nice, brave, smart young lady, as my role model.",1134691200,5,427,4.783783783783784
5961941,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I loved watching it as a kid. This is movie that everybody in Czechoslovakia know and love. Czechoslovak movies are always on location, never staged on artificial set and this really shows. Cinematography is always beautiful, because people in show business are not just craftsmen, but artists. Give a present to child and let them know ""real"" ""true"" Cinderella story!",1133654400,3,368,5.15
5961942,4,B00EZSJBGM,"This is a wonderful, romantic and magical Cinderella version - my favorite!!! [Translated: Three Hazelnuts for Cinderella.] But I wish they would have dubbed it in English / put the English version on the DVD! (therefore just 4 stars) It is by director Vaclav Vorlicek, made in the former Czechoslovakia, based on the version of author Bozena Nemcova (1820-1862). The music (by famous composer Karel Svoboda) is absolutely amazing and beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and the way they told the story with those charming actors (Libuse Safrnkov and Pavel Trvncek)... love it... Cinderella is quite a mondern heroine: she can ride the horse and shoot the crossbow better than the prince and stands up for herself. Even though it is with subtitles: watch it anyway!!! This movie (""Drei Haselnsse fr Aschenbrdel"") is extremely popular in Germany and is shown there every year in the Christmas season. On the German Amazon website www.amazon.de you can buy the soundtrack (original music, ASIN B00009S7RD, I can highly recommend the CD), the German DVD version with some specials (ASIN B00026ZDFE) and a German picture and story book (ISBN 978-3359016533). There is also a box with OST-CD and DVD and wedding charm coming up (ASIN B0018YMZOQ).",1132963200,5,1241,5.17910447761194
5961943,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I have seen this movie many times when I was growing up.  Love this version, of a great story, best of all.  I have long been looking for an english language release so that I may show it to my children, but have settled to buy the german PAL VHS release for the time being.",1128556800,,274,3.963636363636364
5961944,4,B00EZSJBGM,"I remembered this movie from my childhood, and wanted to share it with my daughter. I bought it last year (my daughter was only 4) and I read all the subtitles to her the first time or two, but after that I didn't need to. She loved to watch it (every day!) without even knowing exactly what they are saying!  I wish I could find a copy with the English dubbing, but she's enjoying it just the way it is!",1126828800,2,404,4.05
5961945,5,B00EZSJBGM,"This was a great movie!  I saw an english version on TV back in the 70's as a young girl.  It was called Three Nuts for Cinderella. I have been looking for the dvd for a few years.  Even though this is in Czech, it is still funny and very well done.  The subtitles are there to help you understand.  I watched it with my teenage children and they liked it too.  The story line is better than most Cinderella styles of that day.  Some parts are a little cheesy, but it still has the ability to make you laugh and root for Cinderella.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone who likes fairy tales and feel-good movies.",1125014400,,614,4.1440677966101696
5961946,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I remember watching this on the Kukla, Fran, and Ollie show as a child and have been hoping for its release to video or DVD for many years. The DVD production values are, as stated in other reviews, not the greatest, but I'm just glad to have the movie.

In this version, Cinderella slaves for her stepmother and one stepsister, wonderfully portrayed here. An old friend and fellow servant brings her a small branch with three nuts on it. With the help of an apparently magical owl, she uses the three nuts to disguise herself and meet the prince in a variety of situations, not just the ball. It's great fun to watch her beat him and his friends in an archery game.

Be aware that there is no English language track on the DVD, only the original Czech with English subtitles. They aren't the best, but you can tell what's going on.",1123718400,36,832,4.431372549019608
5961947,3,B00EZSJBGM,"This movie aired on CBC in Southern Alberta, Christmas day, when I was about 8 or 9, I have never forgotten the story, but unfortunately did forget the title. Luckily I stumbled upon it on Amazon. I can't wait to see it again.",1112572800,,226,4.27906976744186
5961948,5,B00EZSJBGM,"Few weeks ago I have found this film available on Amazon. Today I have finally received my DVD and it truly made my day. Thank you Amazon!!!

Tri Orisky Pro Popelku is one of my favourite movies of all times. I have seen it many times and will watch it again and again... I grew up in the Czech Republic and was lucky to see all the magical fairytales my country has to offer. I recommend this movie to everyone especially to all of you who have a little bit of a kid left in you....

I call this movie a ""true fairytale"", it is way better then cartoons or most of the children programs you see on the tely...I just wish there was more Czech movies available and not just drama, but comedy and more fairytales!!!",1107302400,5,712,4.189781021897811

5961954,5,B00EZSJBGM,"This is a wonderful alternative story to Disney's Cinderella - in this one Cinderella, in addition to being a kind person, is a smart, strong, clever young woman who wins the heart of the prince for this. The 3 magic nuts help her to achieve this (no fairy godmother, but the owl...). I saw this as a kid on the CBS Saturday Morning Movie show time and I wanted to share it with my kids.  It is considered a Czech heritage film I found out. This is live action film and watching the faces of the characters is great. ALSO - There is a warning that this DVD might not work on all DVD players since it is from Europe but when I got it I was delighted that it does work on mine.",1424649600,4,675,4.037313432835821

5961957,5,B00EZSJBGM,"This is a beautiful retelling of the Cinderella classic fairy tale.  I have to admit, I didn't know what to expect when I came upon this in the library and saw that it was a Czech film from the 1970s.  However, it does have some English subtitles (obviously done by somebody who studied English as a second language). So it is quite watchable for a non-native Czech person.  It is a very well done movie with the snowy background and rustic village setting all lending an authentic feel to the film.  When does a fairy tale actually seem realistic? Somehow, this movie does.  The young girl portraying Cinderella is beautiful of face and the evil stepmother very convincing in her role.  The bailiff who sympathizes with Cinderella is a likeable fellow.  And there are some comic relief scenes between the prince and his tutor who tries in vain to get the outdoorsman prince to spend time learning history and etiquette.  The variation of three magical acorns instead of the fairy godmother works well.  And the hunting scenes, while disconcerting to a city girl like me, are not too gaudily done.  All in all, it is a clean film and makes for a very nice time.",1412035200,2,1161,4.619512195121951
5961958,5,B00EZSJBGM,"Nice movie to watch around Christmas. Or any other time of the year....

5961960,4,B00EZSJBGM,"I remember this movie from my childhood.  I had watched it on Saturday morning T.V.
This version of Cinderella is unique in that the character goes outside the traditional
role and shows some extra spunk and personality.
I didn't give it a 5 star just because I don't remember having to read subtitles when I saw this in grade school.
 I was a little disappointed that I did not get the English version.  Perhaps there isn't one.",1389312000,,429,4.545454545454546
5961961,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I used to *love* watching this version of Cinderella, and I've looked for this for years (on and off).  Such a fun memory!

As far as giving you a review, it's hard because I have always loved the Cinderella stories but I'm not a critic.  If you enjoy Cinderella stories, this is worth adding to your collection.",1373846400,,312,4.43859649122807
5961962,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I am norwegian and this movie is a christmas classic here. However the version is poorly dubbed by ONE man, it sounds horrible, but everybody here loves it. The chech voices are faintly hearable in the back, and the story is just so lovely. Therefore we have been on the hunt for this movie (without the horrible dub) since forever. The english subtitles are okay, though there were quite a few mistakes in them.

It is a beautiful movie I would recommend to anyone.",1356566400,5,466,4.5476190476190474
5961963,5,B00EZSJBGM,"As many others who have left reviews here or on Netflix, I used to watch this back in Germany since the mid 70s. It was shown in December as one of the regular holiday movies. Actually, since I used to live in the South of Germany, I was watching it on German, Swiss, and Austrian TV each season. Since moving the the U.S., I have been missing this ritual (along with Dinner for One on New Years, and Caro Kaffee) the most. Finally, one of the three is back in my life!",1319846400,4,469,4.108695652173913
5961964,5,B00EZSJBGM,"For anyone looking to buy this movie, carefully read the product description - this German language DVD is PAL/Region2 and won't play in the US (we are NTSC/Region1). I don't think this movie has ever been offered as a DVD for the US market, at least I was never able to find one.
Growing up in Germany (once upon a time), this movie was part of the christmas tradition. I loved it as a child and still do today, so I bought the DVD - along with a code free DVD player!
It's definitely not your familiar Disney Cinderella story. Personally, I like the Czech version a whole lot better. The plot still includes the evil stepmother and stepsisters, the prince and a happy ever after; but instead of a fairy godmother she has 3 magic hazelnuts. When she can manage get away from her never-ending workload, she rides a horse and hunts with a crossbow. And she plays hard to get with the prince, who has to solve 3 riddles...I love this story, the music and the scenery - it's just a beautiful movie.",1313539200,8,995,4.383783783783784
5961965,3,B00EZSJBGM,"My children love this film. Viewing it is a part of the Christmas traditions in Norway as it is on the public TV station every year on Christmas Eve. We are celebrating Christmas in NY this year and  I wanted to bring the ""Threee Wishes for Cinderella"" film  with me to keep the traditions. In Amazon I only found this one, sold by a german seller. When we opened it we found it was only in german. There were no other options for language. I am sorry to say - it was a big disappointment. The film is beautiful. It is a little scary, but overall a  feel-good film perfectly suitable for kids waiting for Christmas. But in german? No, please! And there were no warnings on the Amazone site ""only in german"".
So this year the tradition was broken.",1293580800,3,746,4.314285714285714
5961966,5,B00EZSJBGM,"This is the best Cinderella movie EVER! Everything is right about this movie. I used to watch this in Germany all the time and it brings back many memories of snowy Christmases and little-girl-ideas of the perfect love story *sigh* LOL. Seriously though, could somebody please dub it in English (or at least get the German version on DVD to play in the US). I LOOOOVE this movie!

5961968,4,B00EZSJBGM,"Three Wishes for Cinderella is a beautiful and enchanting version of the Cinderella story; a must see! The only negative part is that it is not really for children to enjoy because of the language. The movie comes with undertitles. But anyway, it is a beautiful movie!",1226361600,,268,4.723404255319149
5961969,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I grew up with a dubbed version of this on TV every Christmas eve. After having left my home country, so many of my Christmas rituals were abandoned (I couldn't get hold of all traditional food, Donald Duck at 15:00, etc etc), as was this. A couple of years ago, I found that it was released on DVD, and I of course had to purchase it. This with the ""Servant and the Duchess"" (which I got from Amazon.de) was the two things that made some consolation for all the things I was missing.

I later managed to get the dubbed version from Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ([...]), so now I have two versions. That's just how much I love this.",1221523200,,638,4.361344537815126
5961970,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I love cinderella movies - and of the modern versions this is the absolute best. Beautiful landscape, fantastic dresses, and a *theme* song to top it all! And the best part - after struggeling with a stepmum and stepsister she gets her prince!
The only major difference from the ""real"" cinderella we know is that this one hasn't got a fairy goodmother - instead she has animals (especially an owl) and three hazelnuts to help her.

The film is in tsjeck with english subtitles - it's not the best - sometimes it's not even translated into a whole sentence. BUT - you get the story anyway, and can enjoy 85 enchanted minuttes in the forrest with cinderella and her prince.",1221177600,,671,4.591666666666667

5961973,5,B00EZSJBGM,"In Norway this movie has been a tradition to view every single christmas morning since early 90's i guess. (Our christmas is celebrated on 24th, Not on 25th as in US) I love this movie! It really reminds me about my childhood, and i still, as 22 years old, can't stop spending the Christmas morning by watching this together with others of my family! Our version is dubbed to Norwegian and i really wanted to find it with its original Checz-spoken language. After a lot of research then i finally found it here and i am happy for that. Finally i can watch it as it was published in 1973. I have always wondered about how the actors/actresses really sounds.

I will dearly recommend everyone to see this movie, wether you're old or young, man or woman, this is a great movie!!! You'll love it!",1186012800,4,792,4.462068965517242

5961975,5,B00EZSJBGM,"I am Czech,and this movie reminds me my childhood. This is a classical fairy tale, which was played in my country every year before christmass. The movie is well done. Cinderella is more adventurous compared to the original story by brothers Grimm.",1162684800,,248,4.928571428571429
5961976,5,B00EZSJBGM,"A beautifully well constructed movie. From the very beginning, the destiny of Cinderella and the prince is sealed. When one of her friends servant asks her what she would like to have back from town, she simply answers: ""Just bring me the first thing that will fall on your nose."" (phrase actually taken from the brothers Grimms'tale.) And so it does happen, with the help of the prince, though, who, wanting to make a joke on the servant, shoots an arrow targetting a nest on a tree branch. He doesn't miss (for something he's the prince) and the nest falls on the servant's head. He finds inside three chestnuts on a twig. Three chestnuts because, as the original title says: ""Three Chestnuts for Cinderella."" Each contains what will make Cinderella happy, closing the loop perfectly. Libuse Safrankova is absolutely cute and wonderful in her role, performed with talent. Pavel Travnicek, who plays the prince isn't that good, but his awsome outfits hide a bit his lack of talent. The stepmother is ""awfully perfect"", and even funny when she wears that unbelievable umbrella hat with ridiculous dignity.

My five year old son watches this movie since he's three and never stopped loving it, although he's now used to 3D animation movies such as those from Disney-Pixar and Dreamworks. ""Three Wishes for Cinderella"" is definitely special, beautiful and perfect. Don't miss it.

For an extra information, the German version (""Drei Haselnsse fr Aschenbrdel"") has been digitally remastered. Not the yellow box version, but the one which presents Cinderella and the Prince on the cover, with a blue label: ""DIGITAL berarbeitete FASSUNG"" (digitally remastered). The entire movie has been cleaned of all its scratches, the colour enhanced, thus recovering its original aspect of the 1974 release. The audio has not been forgotten as it now offers a new digital AC3 (2 channels) quality. Available also on Amazon, but from Germany. That means: for zone 2 (or region free) players only.",1158710400,16,1979,5.048929663608563
