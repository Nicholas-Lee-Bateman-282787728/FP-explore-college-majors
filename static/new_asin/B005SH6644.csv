What I liked about this video is seeing it through the eyes of players, coaches, announcers, writers, and especially...the fans that were challenged to root for a team that had broken their hearts time after time.  Everyone that went through that season remembers waiting for the something to deny them the Cup and how sweet the victory skate was.  This video is not perfect and could have some additional insights and perspective that were not presented at the time...but that said, we enjoyed this tremendously and got a real rush from the greatest run to the Cup in NHL history!!!",1336953600,4,776,4.6911764705882355
4883816,2,B005SH6644,"Was very excited to see that this video was coming out, having grown up in New Jersey as a big Ranger fan and having gone to Games 3 and 6 of the Finals in Vancouver that year. If you have a great interest in fan remembrances of this team and these playoffs (and there are a ton of fan remembrances) than this DVD is for you. Personally, I would have MUCH preferred far greater insight into the games and the players as well as the rift between Neil Smith and Mike Kennan (barely mentioned, even though it caused Kennan to leave after just one year as coach). The Rangers and Devils played, arguably, the greatest series in the history of the NHL in the semi's, yet you see very little of the play (and less of the Finals) and quite honestly, I learned practically nothing from this retrospective. I found it uneven right from the start where it opens with a montage of fans giving you their thoughts of where they were and what they were doing when it all happened. Maybe it was made to appeal to the social media set where everyone tells you about their individual experiences (ironically, what I am doing with this review). I have always felt that the story is what is happening on the ice and with the players, not in the stands. In summary, not horrific but greatly disappointed and cannot, in all honesty, recommend.",1335916800,7,1322,4.444444444444445

8484941,5,B005SH6644,This DVD is a must-have if you are a Rangers fan.  I am a season ticket holder and die hard fan.  I already own (on VHS) Oh Baby! and the 1994 Cup Video that commercially sold.  This is probably the best yet (though Oh Baby! is a close second).  It has very high production value and has awesome footage (most of which we have already seen though).  I watched this on my Blu-Ray player and 60-inch TV and the picture was crisp and almost HD-quality.  The old footage was of course old footage.,1373760000,2,493,4.247311827956989

8484947,4,B005SH6644,"As a diehard Rangers fan, I loved this story. However, after remembering the tape ""Oh Baby!"" from my childhood, it doesn't compare. That was the only thing holding this back from 5 stars. I wish they would release Oh Baby! On DVD. This is a must have for reminiscing purposes.",1338854400,,276,4.54
