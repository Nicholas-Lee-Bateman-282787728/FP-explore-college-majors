What do you get when you combine a decommissioned space ship set (ala Firefly) as well as computer models of, said ship, that can be ever so slightly tweaked, with a rough and ready crew that includes a super sexy vampire babe, a tough Asian chick, a good old boy and a new recruit, thrown out alone in the deepest, darkest, reaches of the human colonized universe, to fight different variations of vampires, with a nice smattering of situation specific humour and a lot of nasty/gory special effects?!!

You get a little gem of a film called, ""BLOOD SUCKERS""!!!

The ONLY real problem with this film, isn't in the actual movie itself, but in the DVD case, which to be honest, is a tad misleading.

I think that if they had used my header as their tag line, then more of the right people, for whom this film was created for, would give it a try, and realized what a great little gem of a film this, conglomeration of, sci-fi/horror/comedy, really is.

So if my header sounds intriguing to you, you like hot vampire babes (or are just curious as to what the Firefly set has been doing since the shows cancellation) then run right out and get it (and if, like me, you're lucky enough to find a new copy of it at Zellers, for $4.95 (Canadian funds) even better).",1173052800,8,1279,4.448717948717949
