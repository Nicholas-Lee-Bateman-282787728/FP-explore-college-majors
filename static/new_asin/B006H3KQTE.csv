8498099,4,B006H3KQTE,"[Alfredo Alfredo - 1972] Anyone who has read my MYA reviews knows I'm no fan of their slipshod prints, re-titled films and ridiculous prices, along with blatant disregard and hardcore abuse of its core audience, but this time Amazon is at fault for listing incorrect product details.

First, the film is presented in Full Frame and NOT Widescreen (MYA's also to blame here - they list the aspect ratio as 1.85:1(16/9) but have a box lower down on the dvd case w/ 1.33:1 listed, those deceptive bastards); secondly, the audio options are English OR Italian with NO subtitles, another blunder in the details, thanks to Amazon. Thirdly, both audio options are in Mono - no stereo at all, so be prepared to crank up the volume on whatever you plan on watching it on or you won't hear a good deal of dialogue, as there are many phone calls where the caller can hardly be heard. I was livid when I put this on for a relaxing viewing of a solid flick rendered meager by hearing Stephania Sandrella's voice cartoonishly dubbed. As for extras - you must be joking, this is a MYA release.

As far as the film itself is concerned, director Pietro Germi ('Divorce, Italian Style', 'Seduced and Abandoned', both of which also starred Stephania Sandrelli) takes another ascerbic shot at the pratfalls of marriage and divorce; and while the film isn't as glorious as his previous efforts, it's still a fine, solid film worth checking into, in spite of Dustin Hoffman being horribly miscast and delivering an extremely weak performance. He's the film's main liability, and Sandrelli is its saving grace. (Think 'Madigan's Millions' but, when you're done shuddering, remember the director is Germi).

In spite of all these detractions, until a better copy is made available, this is what we're left with, and beggars can't be choosers. Sure, it's a compromise, just like marriage, right?",1334016000,14,1870,4.855799373040752
