Unfortunately, many of the episodes skipped, paused repeatedly. In fact the next to last episode of the series skipped completely after the opening credits.",1457568000,4,222,5.0

7580760,3,B019QLXX20,"So they FINALLY release a blu-ray version of Hell's Kitchen! The picture looks great and it's all on 1 DISC!! But... they don't encode it so it resumes where you last watched so every time you turn it off it reverts back to the start! Kinda annoying, especially when there's 16 episodes!",1463529600,3,287,4.538461538461538

7580766,2,B019QLXX20,Watched this show today and was not able to watch all episodes on the final disc.  You could see images clearly nor could you hear the dialogue.  Am very disappointed with this product.  Have purchased similar items in the past and was quite happy; but not this time.  Will seriously consider before purchasing anything further.,1459296000,2,328,4.909090909090909
7580767,5,B019QLXX20,"No, theres not really any fire this season because just like previous seasons this release does not make use of the original theme song, but the jungle opening is just as fun as the previous openings. This particular release also omits the bumpers that happen right before commercial breaks. Season 14 is rounded out this year with 16 contestants, including well rounded Meghan, country boy Randy, catty Nick, and our fighter T. Our full cast list is Blue - Josh, Michael, Milly, Randy, Cameron, Brendan, Bret, Nick, Adam, and our red team, Sara, Alison, Christine, Meghan, Monique, Crissa, Michelle, Mieka,, and T.

Lets talk about the release itself now, all 16 episodes are here spread across 3 discs. (Disc one has 5 episodes, disc two has 4 episodes and disc 3 has 6 episodes.) Just like the previous releases, weve got each and every episode presented raw and uncensored, but not necessarily uncut as the episodes are missing their commercial bumpers. The video quality itself varies, the first episode looks somewhat grainy and out of focus, while the 2nd episode looks great, possible compression issues?

Final Thoughts? A lot of people have gotten tired of this show, calling it stale, or predictable, and Ill be honest this season is really no different than the previous seasons. There are surprise eliminations, bodily harm, and random guest stars including Holly Marie Combs. If you're a fan of the show, why not buy it? Ive collected each season and will continue to enjoy the show as long as Ramsey wants to punish these poor kids.",1457913600,6,1547,4.900763358778626
