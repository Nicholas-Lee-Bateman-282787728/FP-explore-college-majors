I did not care for the re-enactments of a modern actor portraying Baker, many times showing him skating and stick handling along a frozen river.....the actor looked nothing like Baker, he had long-dark, almost shoulder length hair instead of blond, and appeared to be ~ 210-220lbs, his facial features looked more like Jim Thorpe than pics of Baker.......his sweats, supposedly modeled after  circa early 1900's gym clothes, were very loose fitting, and he was wearing baggy shorts over his sweat pants that made him look like he was wearing a diaper.  Lastly, he was wearing modern hockey skates (look at the blades and blade holders)  with a cheap leather prop over the laces.  In a historical bio about such a legendary figure, one would think that more care would have been taken to avoid such obvious flaws.",1500940800,,908,4.953947368421052

2) Best hockey player in the world at the time - ask the Canadians - they played against him
3) Of the first 8 inductees into the ice hockey Hall of Fame there were 7 Canadians and Hobey Baker.
4) F. Scott Fitzgerald used him as a character in his novels
5) Best all around athlete the Ivy League ever produced - not even close
6) Died way, way too young after being a fighter pilot in World War One
7) His ghost still haunts Princeton University
8) Never got paid a penny to play - would have refused the money anyway - he played because he loved it
9) Dashing, almost like a Greek God they said.
10) They don't make 'em like this anymore - not even close",1348185600,6,720,4.041958041958042
