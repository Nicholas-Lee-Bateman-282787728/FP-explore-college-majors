Set in the Canadian wilderness it follows a group of wayward teens on the road to have a good time at a lakeside cabin. It once again proves its always safer to stay in the city and party then hit the road and avoid the crazed locals.",1369526400,11,372,4.485294117647059

5707400,1,B00C8UH3RS,Don't let the cover fool you. This is a very slow paced movie with the only redeeming value I saw was the girl in a bikini dancing. She was the only interesting part of the whole thing. She does a very slow sensual dance which was very entertaining. Other than that the movie was very boring and uneventful. 1 star was very generous. The concept was good but the follow through was tedious.,1438387200,,390,4.3561643835616435

5707403,4,B00C8UH3RS,"I have to admit The Corrupted was more fun than I was expected.  The production quality was decent and the acting a bit stilted, but those are the kinds of traits you expect with a flick like this.  If you are a fan of Remote Horror Vacations or Nameless Cosmic Spawn, I think you can get down with an evening of popcorn and The Corrupted.

Yes. It is low budget,but I don't fault the movie for that. I fault it for the horrible acting, the atrocious dialogue, and the absurd actions that the characters take lead up to and just after the stinky stuff hits the fan

If you want serious scares, look elsewhere. If you want passable acting, look elsewhere.  If you want... oh, forget it. Just look elsewhere. This movie is not worth your time.",1429920000,,668,4.379032258064516

5707430,1,B00C8UH3RS,"Oh, gods, this was bad. Equal parts Typical College Kids Meet Evil jerkfest and bad ripoff of The Honeymoon, this film had a *sliver* of real substance at its heart--the realization that the ""human"" perspective is no more valid than an ant's, and that greater, wider perspectives can change how one views ANYthing beyond all recognition--but it was smothered beneath atrocious dialogue, acting that would make the most fishbrained Dagonite burble ""My anglerfish *wife* could do better than that!"" and effects make Syfy Channel Originals look like WETA masterpieces. This wasn't the first time a chick in a bikini with a mouthful of stinging tentacles led me into a bad experience, and it won't be the last, but at least those other ones didn't involve me sitting there just staring at the screen making me constantly ask myself, ""WHY am I still watching this crap?""",1419638400,2,865,4.972413793103448

5707434,2,B00C8UH3RS,"This billed itself as Lovecraftian, unless that somehow was transformed to mean tentacles then it is a lie. There is no good building sense of terror, slow reveal of unspeakable horror, or descent into madness.

For B movie buffs, gotta warn you there is no buff. 2 simulated fully clothed sex scenes and a few bikini and panty scenes are as risque as it gets. I could care less if it was guys nude but with a story this thin nudity buys a lot of forgiveness.

What does this have? A parasite on the loose infecting people. Dialog about on par with Blair Witch Project (constantly cursing one another). There is also a kernel of a potential story that with nurturing, budget, and actors could maybe be redone into a decent horror film.",1417737600,,735,4.518796992481203
5707435,3,B00C8UH3RS,"It does get the Lovecraftian right.  Some acting is rough, but not so bad as a small Indy film usually is. Moodwise, it also has the feel/pacing it needs.",1417478400,,154,4.310344827586207
5707436,3,B00C8UH3RS,"I can understand the one star reviews.  Six people in their early twenties, a few with really thick Canadian accents, go to a cabin in the woods and spooky things happen.  In addition, NOTHING HAPPENS for the first half hour.  I'd recommend skipping to the thirty minute point where they're all talking on the dock at night.  You won't miss much other than an amusing park ranger and a hairy guy who starts transforming (this IS Lovecraft-esque after all)

I can't really justify my three star rating other than saying that I have a soft spot for HP Lovecraft.  Yeah, he sucks as a writer, and yeah, almost all the adaptation of his stuff is god awful (exception: In the Mouth of Madness).  But I am just really intrigued by his themes.  If you are unsure if this film is for you, I have a question that is a bit of a spoiler...

""What if an alien turned an ant into a human, with all the human emotions and drives intact; would the ant still want to build its anthill?""  If you think that's a stupid question, you won't like this movie.  If you are awakened by such a question, I'd recommend Nietzsche.  Sometimes when you stare into the abyss, the  abyss stares back at you.  I don't know what that means, but that's some spooky as-ed sh--, to paraphrase Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.  If you're not into esoteric philosophical stuff, then this is a one and a half star movie.",1416873600,4,1383,4.41106719367589

5707438,3,B00C8UH3RS,"Found this acceptable because of its Lovecraftian efforts. Clumsy, hideous script, with a pause in the middle to express a Lovecraftian ""futilitarian"" theme. The lines for the Alien Intelligence have a little something as well.

5707446,3,B00C8UH3RS,"Lovecraftian horrors occur at an isolated lakeshore cabin on a pleasure weekend booked by a group of young friends.  As the film goes on, the goings-on of its characters become increasingly terrifying - and stunningly gory and gross.

5707448,4,B00C8UH3RS,"This parasite horror slasher made me smile. The usual MO with slasher is to portray the kids who are off to party as the most shallow people imaginable. The characters in this film actually pause from their revelries to have a nice philosophical discussion about what it is, if anything, that makes life worth living.
And for those out their with a lech for pretty girls in bikinis, there's certainly that. And for nature lovers there's plenty of eye candy, too.
This is not specifically a Lovecraft adaptation, but the arrogance of the invading creatures is definitely Lovecraft influenced.

If you look at the DVD cover and read the subtitle you will know this is another man's body taken over by something else. There has been a number of great films out there within this narrow horror genre, my favorite being ""The Stuff."" This one starts out building fun likeable characters, especially Officer Brick. What the film failed to do was to follow up on these great characters. It introduced cardboard characters and ruined the film with a cheap sounding demonic  voice enhancer, something typically used in extreme low budget high school or college productions.

The film is short at 76 minutes which includes an ending 7 minute credit roll. The DVD menu allows you to play the feature, play the extras or opt to watch one particular scene  of a girl in bra and panties up-chucking green slim on the beach, the film highlight.

Includes some pointless stoner philosophy talk about our relationship with insects, which they thought was heavy.  ""If you were an ant and suddenly became human, would you still be concerned about building your ant mound?""

Like most creature feature horror flicks, if you go into this movie with a notebook and pen expecting to critique every bit of dialogue and section of plot, you're going in with the wrong attitude and will probably join the ranks of the one-star club.

It gives jumps and bumps at just the right times.  There is a little gore, but not much.  What is there is done very well.  I really like the iridescent green puke!  Gross, but done with power!  The action is timed well and, like a good horror movie should do, there isn't too much character build-up.  The acting is good, and the cinematography and directing are good, too.
