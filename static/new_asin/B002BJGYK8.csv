3894580,1,B002BJGYK8,"The three male stars of the film floundered about as though the first rehearsal was a few minutes before the filming - they seemed unsure of their lines and their characters and thus, were lacking in emotion.  The direction was ineffectual.  The story line (can't really call it a plot) was episodic in nature - jumping about with no real connection as though the book had scenes lifted and filmed without any thought to the whole.  We are shown no reason why the characters pair off as they eventually do - in fact, the opposite is true.  Mariel Hemingway was the lone bright spot and a movie about her character would have been much more interesting.  I think one of the basic flaws is trying to make light comedy of a group of 70+ year old selfish bachelors (who somehow believe they are a ""catch"") trying to take advantage of a penniless, recently evicted, grieving widow who has fallen on such bad times that she has to consider being a maid, cook, nurse, housekeeper and bed partner in order to survive.",1252886400,,1009,4.552486187845304
3894581,3,B002BJGYK8,"It's the ""old guys"" who make this film worth watching--David Carradine, Bruce Dern, Rip Torn, and in a smaller role, Charles Durning.  Carradine (we will miss him!), Dern, and Torn are all fabulous in their roles as old bachelors/widowers who need a housekeeper and decide one of them must take a mail order bride in order to get one.  The whole thing is worth it just for the scene in which the woman they see emerging from the train ""does not suit.""  Watching them scamper away and hide made me laugh out loud.  Mariel Hemingway, who plays the woman they do like, is also worth watching.  She brings dignity and a sense of mystery to her character.  I wish we had seen more development of her character in this film--it felt like there was so much more to tell.

The reason that I only gave this film 3 stars is that if it weren't for the actors, I don't think I would have watched it all the way through.  It's very light on plot, and entirely predictable.  At times, it felt as if scenes that would have furthered the story were left out, and unnecessary scenes put in.  There was plenty of room for more character development scenes with everybody, and a better explanation about a side plot concerning dispute over serving rum at the saloon. It looked and felt to me like this was a very low budget film that one of the guys agreed to do for a novice filmmaker--like for a grandkid or something.  I do not know if that was actually the case, but I felt like saying ""Not bad for a first try, but . . ""  This film did not have a professional feel to it, and it could have used more skillful writing/editing and tighenting of the scant story line, while expanding on the character development.

Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any of the stars, or to anyone who wants a sweet, simple, low-tech movie with no violence or profanity.",1250985600,14,1870,4.354466858789626

3894583,3,B002BJGYK8,The first third of this film is hilarious. I just love the way the three old timer sea farers reach the conclusion that one of them has to marry in order that they have a housekeeper to share. The best is the hunt for a bride through the lonely hearts column. The lines are perfectly delivered - the facial expressions a scream to watch as the plan is hatched and an ad placed. But after the mail order bride arrives the movie becomes predictable. It is all grandad's fantasy as young women apparantly fall for 2 old men who look like they won't make their next birthday. Just 3 stars - but worth watching for the very funny first third of the film.,1245196800,8,649,4.284552845528455

3894604,4,B002BJGYK8,"With a film in Cape Cod, Directed by the very capable Dan Adams, and starring:
the late David Carradine, Rip (& Angelica) Torn, Mariel Hemmingway, the late
Charles Durning, it would have to be good. Don't know what the sourpusses
here who gave this movie one stars were watching, but it wasn't this film!

No profanity or undue sexual situations, which you would expect if those complainers
here had read the very fine Cap'n Eire! Three retirement aged (70ish) olde sea
captains need a house keeper for themselves and their cat Lorenzo. They place an
ad in the Journal or Matrimony and score Hemingway!! Only it turns out Carradine,
who's been in three pictures with her now, ends up getting the prize, instead of a
very reluctant Cap'n Torn. Bruce Dern, the third wheel tries to muscle in, but ends
up getting hitched to the two time widow'd/gossip of the town (Angelica Torn, daug-
hter of Geraldine Page, and Rip)! First half is very funny. Not slapstick, just ironic.

Adams free hand style Directing makes all the difference in the world. This was not
an incredibly high budgeted film, but everything I believe was shot, with the cooper-
ation of the great gaffer in the sky, in about one-and-a-half weeks. Adams and the
investors chose the correct folkes for the right roles and their ease with which they
did most everything ont he first and occasionally second takes showed what Pros
they were. Durning played a very sickly, highly religious man who here's the voice
of God tell him to burn down the local pool hall. Good stroyline expands on the Cap'n
Erie novel. Nice to see this kind of quality film in this day and age. The whiners here
who didn't like it can go pound sand. Their probably Liberals who didn't hear enough
vulgarites. If you like that schtick, go watch Quentin Tarrantino. Whopps, sorry Dave, r.i.p

The DVD has some great extras including a nice 1937-2009 tribute to Dave Carradine
who was murdered in Bangkok, Thailand one year after this was wrapped. Happy Viewing,

3894611,3,B002BJGYK8,"The Golden Boys(released April/09)stars,among others,David Carradine as Captain Zeb Hedge,Rip Torn as Captain Jerry Burgess,Bruce Dern as Captain Perez Ryder,Mariel Hemingway as Martha Snow,Charles Durning as John Bartlett,John Savage as Web Saunders,Angelica Torn as Melissa Busteed,and Christy Scott Cashman as Elizabeth Preston. This is a nice tour de force performance by three acting vets in the form of Carradine,Dern and Torn. Along with these three,late actor Charles Durning was on hand to lend his great talent to the proceedings and Mariel Hemmingway. The film is a nice film with touches of the romantic and humourous,which naturally flow out of the interaction of all the characters concerned.
The story finds the three main characters as old sea dogs,living together in the sleepy town of Chatham,Mass,on old Cape Cod back in the year of our Lord 1905. They have all gotten along well leaving most of the chores and ""cooking"" to Torn. Well good old Torn's duties aren't up to snuff anymore and the three decide that they should put an ad in the paper for a woman,and Torn gets to marry her! They of course get many replies but one intrigues the three. It is a plucky response from a lady in Nantucket. She is due to arrive a in few days time and the three are going to turn out at the station to greet her. When the appointed time comes a homely,heavy and mustachioed woman disembarks the train carrying the suitcase of a Mrs. Snow,the woman who wrote them. They all flee for their lives to an old fishing shack by the water and wait a good part of the day before they decide to mosey home. Waiting for them there is Mrs. Snow,but not the lady they first saw. It is a comely Hemmingway,who smiles and tells Carradine the lady they saw had picked her suitcase up by mistake. She says she will spend the night in a local hotel and return the next morning to talk turkey with the three.
Carradine attends a church service and meets his old friend Durning. During the service mention is made by the father of sin in their own community. Durning stands up and tells everyone in no uncertain terms his dislike for the local billiard hall that is now serving liquor. He wants others to join him in stopping it,but gets no takers. Instead that night the billiard hall is set ablaze. The whole town turns out to help and Carradine finds Durning laying face down at the back. In his jacket pocket he finds an empty bottle of kerosine and puts two and two together. He hides the jacket and turns Durnings body around to make it look like he collapsed trying to run to help,instead of running away.
Durning is brought to Carradine and the boys home and they look after him. He has suffered a paralyzing stroke and Carradine immediately sends a letter to his grand daughter who arrives shortly thereafter. Between her and Hemmingway,who is settling in helping the three around their home,the men`s lives have been made alot easier. Also,her betrothed,Torn,keeps putting off asking her to marry him. Dern is now warning that he will step in if Torn doesn`t,much to Carradine`s chagrin. In the meantime the owner of the billiard hall has found the jacket belonging to Durning,along with the empty kerosine bottle. Putting the puzzle together he now starts to blackmail Durnings grand daughter for money,or he will go the sheriff. Durning eventually succumbs to his condition and passes away. Carradine confronts the billiard hall owner ,telling him to give the girl her money back or he will call the sheriff. The two have a stand off until Carradine drops the bombshell that Durning has died,taking away any leverage the hall owner had. The owner relents.
The next day there is a shipwreck just off shore and Carradine and Dern go to help. Carradine risks his life to get across a lifeline to the wreck to rescue a lone member of the local ship rescue team stuck there. The man went on board to rescue sailors that weren`t there to begin with. Carradine becomes a local hero for a time. Back home Dern,who originally had fallen hard for Hemmingway,has now reconsidered his old feelings for the local town gossip,and plans to marry her after her persuasive present of clam chowder. Carradine also has a heart to heart with Hemmingway. Hemmingway had been developing feelings for Carradine but they were unrequited. Now he is coming out and expressing his feelings for her. She accepts his hand in marriage eagerly. Carradine breaks his`betrayal`to Torn,who pretends to take it hard. Once Carradine leaves the room he jumps for joy. The film comes to a close showing Dern and Carradine both enjoying married life.
This film with these three pros,five counting Durning and Hemmingway,would seem like a no brainer of a winner of a movie. But the film`s script and pace is as slow and easy going as the town they live in. No one exudes alot of emotion,except for Durning during his church tirade. Most of the time everyone is very polite and easy going. One thing none of the actors had down was that very distinctive Massachusetts fisherman`s accent. Each actor approached it in their own way but none actually nailed it. In fact the billiard hall owner sounded like a refugee from ``Joysey``.That took away from the``realism``and/or believability of the film.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. Included is a featurette and the trailer.
All in all,the film has a great cast but unfortunately it doesn`t live up to its potential. All the major actors concerned did a fine job with what they had to work with,which just wasn`t enough. It`s a nice simple story and that`s all. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1361750400,,5632,4.76560900716479
3894612,5,B002BJGYK8,"The Golden Boys is taken from a story by the regional author Joseph C. Lincoln.  The setting is about a century ago on Cape Cod.  It was a largely different America, and this adaptation largely succeeds in preserving the ways of the inhabitants of the Cape back then.  The accents are not quite right, and some of the expressions were simplified to make them understandable to modern audiences; but mostly this was done very smoothly.  The director has resisted any attempt to modernize the story to conform with political correctness: things are presented honestly, like any of Lincolns stories, and with humor.  Of course, there is a villain (naturally an outsider), and lovable local folks of virtuous nature.  The main female protagonist is not just strong and sensible herself, but she looks for good character in men, and chooses accordingly.",1356998400,,848,5.021428571428571

3894615,1,B002BJGYK8,"Needing a 4th DVD at a local store's ""Rent 3, Get One Free"" bargain Monday, I picked up ""The Golden Boys,"" a movie of which I had never heard; however,  the talent listed on the cover was all topnotch, so I took a chance.  The 1904 novel on which the film was based does not translate well to the little screen (Was this movie ever released to the big screen?  Seems doubtful.)

I am not the kind of viewer who requires nonstop action, but I need a story line that actually moves.  Little complications come and go in ""The Golden Boys,"" some with hardly a bearing on the plot, but the main conflict--who will be the lucky seafarer who gets to marry Mrs. Snow (Mariel Hemingway)?--is hardly substantial enough to make the story interesting.

The first 30 minutes of the movie are especially deadly, partly due to Rip Torn who speaks his lines in such a slow and slurred manner, I was convinced he had been hitting the bottle off camera.  During the last half of the film, he delivers his lines much more articulately and has finally acquired a New England accent, missing earlier in the film.  Of course, when at last he starts speaking with a turn-of- the-century Cape Cod dialect, one has to wonder why he is the only rugged sea captain who has one.  Bruce Dern, formerly a favorite film star of mine, seems to have forgotten how to act.  It was either that, or the fault of the dialogue, which was no better than something penned by a high school student for a creative writing assignment, and poorly paced as well.  The same can be said for veteran actor Charles Durning, but mercifully for everyone concerned, his character doesn't last too long and, therefore, has little to say. Main protagonist, the late David Carradine, is the shining star of the show, and that's faint praise.

The only special feature included on the DVD is a 40-minute documentary  comprised of interviews with cast and crew; it's quite revealing as to the quality of the film.  David Carradine claims he took the role without really reading much of the script, and there are several scenes where he appears to be seeing it for the first time.  Charles Durning lets it slip that he snatched up the part because he needed work.  To me, walk-through character portrayals, even by venerable actors, is not worth an audience.",1312329600,,2300,4.6004901960784315
3894616,2,B002BJGYK8,"All in all this movie was not really funny except when there was a mix up with the mail order bride.  The rest of it was not so interesting or funny.  There was something missing from either the acting or the script, but I am not sure what.",1309564800,,240,3.9791666666666665

3894619,1,B002BJGYK8,"This movie, based on Cape Cod author Joseph Lincoln's book, ""Cap'n Eri"", was shot in my home town (the film was originally titled ""Chatham""), which made it somewhat entertaining for me to watch. That said, it is absolutely the worst film I have ever seen.

I'd rather not relive the horror by going into too many details, just suffice it to say that it was scripted badly, directed badly and, for the most part, acted badly (Bruce Dern, however, did an OK job).

The highlight of the movie was at the very end, when Rip Torn, struggling the entire time to portray what he perceived was a ""Cape Cod"" accent, suddenly developed an Irish brogue. I'm pretty sure he was drunk.

Don't end up on your death-bed, wishing you had back the 97 minutes of your life you wasted on this film. Run, don't walk, and buy or rent something else. Yes, it is THAT bad.

And, though simple, the story is touching, honest and hearfelt.  And while the veteran cast is star-studded, the real delight for me was to watch David Carradine anchor the film with real tenderness and strength.  His performance is really at the center of this film, and the chemistry between him and Mariel Hemingway (who is also excellent), is palpable.  Carradine and Hemingway play two characters who want to see together, and who truly deserve one another.  This is a fine little film with a slew of wonderful performances by longtime favorite actors.",1274054400,3,755,4.8671875
3894621,4,B002BJGYK8,"Now, I'll be honest. This movie isn't exactly in the Casablanca or Gone With The Wind class but I don't think it's really meant to be. It's meant to be the kind of movie that should be watched for enjoyment rather than one that be analyzes the human condition to the Nth degree or is meant to be propoganda for political correctness.

The movie is based on a 1904 story entitled: Cap'n Eri: A story of the Coast by Joseph Crosby Lincoln...and it's a delightful film that any beach/coastal/nautical enthusiast who also enjoys history and romantic comedies would enjoy. Hence the reason I liked it as well as I did.

I felt the director, Daniel Adams, did a pretty good job of translating Lincoln's book into film. I read someplace that Lincoln's literary works could be considered ""celebrating Cape Cod"" and you can clearly see that in this film. It is a celebration of a specific cultural heritage, plus a labor of love on the part of the director.  I wish there would had been more in the movie about the US Lifesaving Service (predecessor of the US Coast Guard), but of course that is a movie-worthy story in itself...perhaps an idea for a future movie for Adams?

All of the actors did their roles, but I particularly enjoyed the acting on the part of the late David Carradine and Mariel Hemingway. The scenery was quite beautiful, and much of the movie was quite hilarious. I laughed my head off when the cat refused to eat the clam fritters. The subplot with the rum house issue was interesting, too. I like the way true friendship was demonstrated in those scenes. Mind you that Web Saunders character needed a kick in the butt, for sure...but even his role was played very well. One of the messages I liked in this movie was re: the treatment of age. Despite being in their 70s, those sea captains still saw themselves as captains, not retirees. They weren't about to be put out to pasture...they still had the opportunity to enjoy life and love and they did.  That's a very good message even for today.",1269475200,4,2010,4.572222222222222
3894622,2,B002BJGYK8,"I can only say that the acting was not very good.  The accents for the area were really amateurish as was the ""old seadog"" language.

3894623,4,B002BJGYK8,"In 1905, three sea captains (played by Rip Torn, Brude Dern, and David Carradine), retired and living together, find that they cannot adequately take care of the cooking and housework. They advertise for a wife (to marry the one who loses a coin throw), and that is what most of the story is about: her arrival (she is played by Mariel Hemingway), how she comes to stay with them before she is to marry the loser, and what happens among the three and with her. There are also a few subplots, including one with Charles Durning, another fine actor, all of which contribute to the story.

This movie is very low-key and moves slowly. It reminds me of movies from the 1950s, when time was taken to develop characters and relationships. There is very little drama in this movie; the story is almost entirely about the characters in it. David Carradine speaks slowly and deliberately, which some people, used to the more frenetic pace of most movies today, might not like, but I relished every minute of it. The characters were well realized, and every detail contributes to the overall story. If you are in the mood for a gentle story, gently told, then this might just be your cup of tea.",1260748800,,1185,4.589622641509434
