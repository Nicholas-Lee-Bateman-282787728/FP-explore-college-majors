7900078,4,788370964X,"I like this dvd set but not as much as the collection I.  I love it that my son would love to repeat the words in Chinese, and re-emphasize what he learned from mommy.  It plays well with some of the songs in Chinese to match.  Since we also watch the English versions, this is definitely a plus.

I do have a few problems with the set.
1) This is not the whole collection II, which should have 10 dvds.  This one is the second half of the collection II.  It is still a good value, but one would be disappointed if he thought he's getting the whole selection.

2) It came with a puzzle, which I really did not want or care. I'd rather to have the rest of dvds.

3) The voices are a little strange, and different from the first set.  This one seems to be translated in Taiwan, which have different accents than what I would like my son to have.  And less songs, more words mimicking the songs.  (We watch the English DVDs, and the songs are one of the big parts of the story many times.)

4) Donald's voice is even harder to recognize.  Give me the shivers every time I try to listen to him, with that scratchy unrecognizable voice.  :-(

Overall, I still like the dvd set, and would definitely buy again, but not as much as the first set.

You do need a multi region dvd player.  I could not even play it at my friends' house, which could play other Chinese dvds she had.",1312243200,2,1371,4.132575757575758
