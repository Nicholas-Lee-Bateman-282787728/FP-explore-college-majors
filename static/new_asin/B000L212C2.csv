2699582,5,B000L212C2,THE GREATEST ANIME OF ALL TIME. OH MY GOB. SAMURAI. GUN. DONT THINK. JUST BUY. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET SUCH A PURCHASE. BUY IT NEW AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF $40! GET WHILE THEYRE STILL IN STOCK! THEY WILL RUN OUT SOON!,1386720000,,212,4.071428571428571
2699583,2,B000L212C2,"It doesn't have enough happening in terms of action, story, humor, character development, or style.  Not sure who the target audience is for this anime, but it obviously missed.  It's not terrible, it's just not good.  Of all my friends that watch all different genres I just can't think of a single person to recommend this to.  Ok, I got it!  If you want something on in the background that doesn't require attention or tempt distraction, and you don't like recordings of soothing ocean sounds; this anime could be for you.",1341187200,,525,4.725274725274725
2699584,5,B000L212C2,"This is one of the physically sturdiest box sets I own! It's nothing like those cheap Viridian Box Sets, that fall apart in a month. This was a fine addition to my collection, and with some good care, I'm sure that it will last through out my entire life. It looks pretty cool on my shelf, sitting next to Samurai 7. The storyline was slow, but I did enjoy it.",1299801600,,360,4.1571428571428575
2699585,1,B000L212C2,"being a advid anime watcher, I'm always looking for new series to get hooked on. this is not one of them. its dull, boring and doesnt even try. if ya looking for hardcore action with epic fight scenes, look elsewhere. this series is just too lame to comprehend.",1253836800,2,261,4.458333333333333
2699586,1,B000L212C2,"I have seen alot of anime over the years, from the very early eighties to the present. I have seen good and bad anime but this series takes the bust category.  While it is set in alternate history setting the storyline is a big mess.  The characters in this series needed a bit more fleshing out, it seems liked this animation was rushed.  There is no real outcome to the story, even the ""un-aired"" final episode was unclear.  This animation needs closure in order for the viewer to clear up any confusion brought up during the viewing process.  The only redeming quality this series has is the opening soundtrack, even this is not enough to save it from it's lack of fit and finish.  I do not recommend this series!!!!!",1243468800,,720,4.5
2699587,1,B000L212C2,"the art and storyline are not as good as expected. the art reminds me of 1980's anime. it's not very detailed. the character of ichimatsu is actually viewed as the villiage idiot. when i think of a gun wielding samurai who mowes down everything in his path and then hates himself for it later, i think of someone who would never take any $#%& from anyone. not so. the episodes where very shot and not very clear on what the heck was going on. these bad guys start appearing and we have no idea where they came from of what their motivation is. it comes of like violence for the sake of hero kill all bad guys violence. save your money .",1220745600,,636,4.221311475409836
2699588,2,B000L212C2,"Now, I've seen a lot of anime. I'm a prolific fan of anime in fact. When I first heard about this series I thought it sounded interesting. Once the boxed set came out and I decided to pick it up I found myself sorely disappointed even before the end of the first episode. Don't let that fool you, I made sure to watch the whole series. There's a lot of things wrong with this series to warrant the low rating.

1: Cheap animation - and when I say cheap I mean CHEAP. Almost every scene has at least some element of very sloppy animation. Everything from short loops of actions to just plain BAD art.

2: Terrible Character designs - All the male characters are almost exactly the same. They all have the same bland old style japanese look. The only people with actual ""good"" character designs were the attractive women and the protagonist. All the women are exceptionally attractive and voluptuous (not that I'm necessarily complaining about that). The Samurai guns themselves are all in these weird outfits. It's like they're wearing skintight leathers with a samurai helmet. It's a hideous and extremely corny look.

3: Unfairly targeting women - Honestly, in almost every episode women are either maimed, tortured, or killed in gruesome ways. Why? Well we can only speculate. In the process, not one guy shares a similar fate. It seems really unfair and even disgusting how the directors and writers target women like this.

4: Excessive language - I've seen a lot of movies, anime, and other things as such. So cursing doesn't bother me in the least. However this series is very excessive. Characters don't hesitate to cuss like truckers in about every scene and in ways that are un-needed or sometimes even unprovocated.

5: Very sketchy plot - Full auto pistols, uzis, machine guns, miniguns, grenades, secret societies, gun weilding assassins, all of this in the 1700's or 1800's? Seriously? The story is full of technology that's FAR ahead of its time.

6: Cheesey dialogue - This is pretty self explanitory. It's the same crappy dialogue over and over and over. ""Hi, I'm samurai gun."" (Seriously, that's an actual line that gets used over and over.) ""Samurai gun, prepare to die!"" The list goes on and on. Yes, it's bad.

7: Wholly uninteresting - The plot is boring, full of holes, and can't keep even my attention span. I sat through the whole series but that was only so I could give an accurate review. The fan service was all over the first two episodes and then suddenly dropped off. That was about the only thing that kept my interest for awhile. Even then it was very little and extremely subdued.

This is just the tip of the iceberg for ""Samurai Gun"". If I can impart any knowledge to anyone reading this it would be one thing...This series is a definate one to PASS on. Don't even bother to pick it up.",1201392000,10,2822,4.652610441767068
8159915,4,B000L212C2,Good collection and hope to watch all soon,1519776000,,42,4.375
8159916,5,B000L212C2,"Great show, ignore the haters. This a classic type of show. If you like Samurai's running around shooting people with pistols then you will like this show. It ended abrutly which sucks because they thought they were getting a second season. The second season got canceled so there is not a lot of closure on the characters. Enjoy what the show is though, and that is a great beat em up.",1495670400,,386,4.450704225352113

8159919,3,B000L212C2,"It was okay... Each episode is connected but the series is not really complete... There is no closure. I think the overall anime would've been better if they  were able to budget a conclusion. The concept was good but they really could have done better.  Plenty of wrapped eye-candy and I do mean ""wrapped.""",1475280000,,307,4.666666666666667
