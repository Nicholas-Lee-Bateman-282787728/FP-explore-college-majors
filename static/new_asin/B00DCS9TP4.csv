This film is poignant, beautifully filmed, superb script and stellar acting.  I think this may be James Cromwell's finest work.  This is a film not to be missed.",1381449600,37,270,4.36

5791369,5,B00DCS9TP4,"My husband and I loved this beautiful movie. We were deeply touched by the story, the characters, the cinematography, the song. Like Craig and Irene, there are many aging couples in the world living interesting lives with great integrity and quietly taking care of each other.

5791375,1,B00DCS9TP4,"Very political movie. Funny how The Man wants no regulations, then when The Man destroys himself because of his inherent  greed and lack of control, man wants that same government to bail him out. Building codes are for safety. Look at 3rd World structures collapsing because of lack of enforced standards. The sons comment about universal health care is another tasteless political dig, coming from a character who grew up on vasts amounts of free land from his father and works for his dad. Typical. I have found European movies tend to be better. The American mentality is so disgusting, and its reflected in the movies. We live in a place where The Living Dead is the number one show on TV. Very fitting.",1523059200,,708,4.709677419354839

5791390,5,B00DCS9TP4,"I really liked this movie. I got so mad when the man encountered all the road blocks to just build a house!

5791393,5,B00DCS9TP4,this is a must watch film and if you do not cry several times during this movie then i feel sory for you. the love of this couple and the dedication of Craig to take care of his wife as best as he could. Craig wins in this instance but this is rare usualy the goverment wins. I have dealt with city and county building departments for over 35 years and its harder to find the people that are willing to help solve your problems. the newer officials are like the inspector in this show. if you have never built a house you should not be able to tell someone else how to build their house. this is such a REAL film. the realities of getting old and the realities of just how much of our lives are controled by the powers that be.,1516492800,,727,4.055555555555555
5791394,5,B00DCS9TP4,I started to watch Still Mine more than a year ago and stopped because I was uncomfortable with the theme of the lead woman character with some signs of dementia.  Too close to my family for comfort.  I tried again and I'm thankful that I did.  It wasn't melancholy or saccharin sweet.  The acting is just real life.  Just relax and let the movie give you pleasure.,1516060800,,365,4.388059701492537

Moreover, I really liked the scenes between the husband and wife...sometimes humorous, sometimes touching, sometimes somber, all emoted very well.  The negative reviews about excessive nudity and foul language are unfounded in my opinion...a strong-willed character like the husband would realistically drop a cuss-word or two from time to time.  And yes, seniors still can get nekkid if they want to, LOL.  Entertaining take on the challenges of the golden years.",1514764800,,547,5.325581395348837

5791412,5,B00DCS9TP4,"I couldn't stop watching this movie. The acting was wonderful. This couple has been together over 60 years and in this case, Craig, the man played by James Cromwell, watches as his wife's mental faculties slowly deteriorate while he deals with bureaucratic nonsense (to him anyway) about a house he's trying to build for him and his wife to live in more easily. I thought I'd find it boring but instead I was riveted. The vagaries of old age are illustrated in all their shades of color, and how humans, with their complex minds, deal with all of it. It was all very sensitively appropriate.",1512864000,,591,4.6380952380952385

5791441,5,B00DCS9TP4,"Wow this was a great movie.  My mother thought I might like it so I decided to check it out.  I am glad I did.  There is some language, but even as a Christian, I was able to watch this movie not offended.  Besides, one has to put themselves in the character's shoes.  If you were facing similar situations, I am sure those words might be uttered from your mouth also.  As far as a couple of nudity scenes:  yes, there are two scenes that I remember.  They are short-lived and the movie could have done without them, but I don't think that is too much of a fault on this movie.  It adds to the humanity.  Apart from all of this, the movie had a powerful message of love through everything life throws your way.  A man who would do anything to keep the love of his life happy and safe.  I can only hope and pray that I grow in age to become a man like the one portrayed in this movie by Mr. Cromwell.  He's not perfect, but overall a good example.  Besides, I thought on several occasions that he was going to punch the local government bureaucrat in the face.  Mr. Cromwell's (Craig is the character) reactions take strength.

5791456,3,B00DCS9TP4,"Not as good as ""On Golden Pond"" The acting was great, but the problem I had was with the story - It sways between being a story on aging, and a story about intrusive building codes. The movie (in my opinion) would have been better without all the building code drama (although I guess that was the basis for the story).

The title ""Still Mine"" alludes to a story like ""On Golden Pond"" but then strays into arguments with building code enforcement. The two main characters were wonderful together, and I truly believe the story was hurt by the ""building code"" issues.

The ending is satisfying, but the story drags out a bit too long.",1497225600,,633,4.495652173913044

James Crowmwell plays Craig Morrison, a 87-year-old strawberry farmer/cattle rancher who will do anything to take care of his failing wife Irene in her twilight years.  Slowly weakening from dementia, he decides to build a smaller house for her across the street on his land, but then faces a plethora of bureaucratic red tape.  Even the townsmen seem to be against him as he's got plenty of land when the rest do not.  Will good prevail over silliness?

The movie was filmed on location in St Martin, New Brunswick.

There are some tender scenes between the couple, some tense scenes between the father and townsmen, some determined scenes between parent and child. This story is based on a real incident that happened in New Brunswick, CND with a man by the same name, who in real life was able to move into the contentious house at age 91 but then soon died in February, 2013.  His wife Irene died in August of the same year.",1495756800,9,1020,4.596685082872928

5791486,5,B00DCS9TP4,"This is a wonderful, honest story, whose uniqueness is that it tells of love in the later years, in all its manifestations, with neither self-consciousness nor artifice. Craig Morrison (James Cromwell) intends to build a single-level house, on his own property, for his treasured Irene (Genevieve Bujold), whose failing memory renders their current one impractical and dangerous. He meets up with many unyielding city codes and ordinances, but he proceeds because his directive comes from a loftier place, his heart.  You'll see how bureaucracy takes to that.  But this is really about what a profound love can look like in this life stage. They quibble, touch, snuggle up, speak of each other's strengths and go easy on the weaknesses, argue, hug, get frustrated, even angry about new physical and mental limitations and accommodate them, kiss, stroke hair and faces, poke gentle fun, spoon, hold each other in sleep, argue, and get naked, both with and without special effects-- either all the way or in a variety of ways-- and reminisce, as long as memory allows.

5792007,5,B00DCS9TP4,"Let me start by addressing the central problem, in my opinion, of the movie. The protagonist, Craig, a man in his 80s, builds a house without complying with applicable building codes. The premise, often stated, is that these codes are unjust when applied to him, and that he is justified in ignoring them as he knows what he is doing. Building codes are universal and have been for as long as civilization. The oldest known building code is contained in the Code of Hammurabi of the 1750s BC  that is, nearly four thousand years ago. If a building collapsed and killed someone, the Code said the builder was to be killed; makes todays codes seem pretty mild by comparison. Surely Craig knew that there were laws, and regulations promulgated pursuant to those laws, and that he had to obey them whether he agreed with them or not  if the speed limit was 35 mph and he drove 50 mph because he thought that was a safe speed for that road and the posted limit was stupid, he could not be surprised if he were stopped and ticketed. Yet he proceeds with building his house without obtaining the proper permits or required inspections and expresses disgust and outrage when the local official charged with enforcing the code calls him to account, and we are clearly meant to identify with Craig and denounce overbearing bureaucracy.

Let me add briefly that the premise that Craig knows what he is doing is quite beside the point. I live in an area where one of the largest builders, a national company, is Del Webb. No one doubts that Del Webb knows how to build a house. But if they decide to erect a new model, they will have to obtain approval of their plans in advance and then submit to periodic inspections during the building process to make certain that they comply with the code at each step  the inspector cant check the piping once the walls are up. As someone who lives in a Del Webb house, I am grateful to know that my house is built to code.

(What can happen when building codes are ignored was dramatically demonstrated today when a structure in Oakland, CA, used by musicians for parties, studios, and living, went up in flames, killing many people (9 confirmed dead as of this writing, estimates reaching 40). The building had no sprinklers, no clear exit path, walls were made of old, dried-out wood, there was a rickety makeshift staircase that trapped people on the second floor, a fire extinguisher didn't work  the building was clearly in violation of just about everything in the building code and was in fact under investigation. Perhaps the authorities didn't act sooner out of sympathy with the musicians using the building, who were removed from their usual venues due to gentrification raising prices to levels they couldn't afford.)

So from the beginning we must be willing to suspend disbelief about this central issue. For the rest, this is a deeply meaningful film about the choices open to us as we age. Craig, in his upper 80s, is wonderfully fit, capable of climbing ladders (Im not quite his age and have been warned by my doctor to eschew step-stools) and building a house from scratch. His wife, Irene, some years younger, is suffering from what appears to be moderate but progressing dementia. He is building this house because their old two-story house is no longer suitable for them and especially for her. He is also building it because he enjoys building.

One factor which is somewhat distancing is Craigs financial resources. He owns 2,000 acres rich with high quality spruce trees suitable for building-quality lumber (thats what he uses to build his house). I don't know land values in New Brunswick, Canada, where this film takes place, but surely 2,000 acres is worth a lot of money. He doesnt want to sell off any of it because  well, just because. He even has a baseball, signed by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, for which he has refused $40,000. In other words, he could surely afford to move to a nice modern single story house right away, rather than taking the time to build one while wasting endless hours fighting with the bureaucrats.

In fact, Craig is strongly advised by his friends and his children to sell his property and move into town. At first glance, we might well agree with them. But if we think about it a bit more, we may wonder what he will do in town. He will have no room in an apartment for his power tools  and any lease he signs will surely prohibit the use of such dangerous and noisy equipment. But this is a man accustomed to working with his hands, making things, farming, building. What is he to do now, take up the oboe? Learn Greek poetry? And how will he take care of Irene? There is a scene where she refuses to leave their truck although it is cold  New Brunswick is around 150 miles northeast of Bar Harbor, Maine  and he has to force her inside while she fights him, screams, bites him, and in the end falls and breaks her hip. So, an assisted living facility? Surely that is what such facilities are for, and clearly she needs assistance. But she has made Craig promise that they will never move into an assisted living facility, and he gave that promise. What to do?

Indeed, what to do? That is the real issue, not building codes, and this movie explores it in exquisite detail with academy award performances by both leads (I don't think they were nominated, but they should have been). I won't give away the ending, but it doesnt matter, because end it any way you like, your question will still be: how will it end for me? Lets assume you have enough money, not as much as Craig could have but enough, through Social Security, pensions, and savings, to live on. In other words, you don't have to work  a good thing too, as jobs are vanishingly scarce for people as they age  so what will you do with your time? If you are a writer, you can keep writing (though your publisher was absorbed into a Dutch conglomerate years ago and nobody there remembers you). If you are a composer, you can keep composing (though the orchestras that played your works went bankrupt). If you are a painter, you can keep painting (though your last gallery show was in 1976). But most people are not writers, composers, or painters; what shall they do when no one will hire them to do anything? All of this is becoming increasingly urgent as people live longer than ever before. When Social Security was passed in the U.S., life expectancy was in the low 60s. Now many men live into their 80s and older, women older still. Most of them do not want to be institutionalized, indeed most of them, at least in the U.S., cant afford to be institutionalized. Yet many of them need some level of assistance, be it only to change light bulbs, A/C filters, and cleaning the oven; many need more help. But after the necessities are met, what will they, what will I, what will you, do with the time left? Thats what this movie asks. Of course it cannot give a definitive answer, as there is none to give.",1480636800,,6960,4.556

James Cromwell and Genevive Bujold are outstanding in this tender, affecting, insightful drama about the bonds and sacrifices of marriage. The film stars James Cromwell as Craig Morrison, a farmer in rural St. Martins, New Brunswick who battles a government bureaucrat for the right to build a new house for his ailing wife Irene when their existing home no longer suits her health needs. After years of stability, the lives of octogenarian couple, Craig and Irene Morrison, are slowly beginning to change. Because of changing times and regulations, they are no longer able to make a living from their small coastal New Brunswick farm. Irene has begun to show signs of early dementia.  To accommodate the declining health of his wife Irene, Craig intends to build a more suitable, small one story house on the property in which he and Irene can live, and his want for what he sees as a comfortable and safe life with Irene in their final years. Based on a true story, this is a must see film about dedication and commitment to the bonds and sacrifices of marriage, and to each other, at any age.

The plot is a bit predictable but there is such a story to be told it is engaging and timely, especially with the recent not-guilty verdict of the Oregon Bundy brothers occupation issue.  It makes you wonder exactly what the government should  be able to prevent you from doing to yourself on your own 2000 acres.

5792590,5,B00DCS9TP4,"Charming film about the old ways versus the new, and how freedom is also affected by aging and the complications of dementia. In the end there are really a number of right options, never just the one's offered. Both leads show the 18 year old selves that exist in their old bodies and the love for each other, family and real friends.",1477526400,,334,4.403225806451613

8592004,5,B00DCS9TP4,"Stumbled on this at the library a few weeks ago. It has become one of my favorite movies, and my list is short. Beautiful music. Beautiful cast. Beautiful story. I love movies that tell a story -- this one happens to be true. It doesn't depend on or need any special effects, and there is zero gratuitous violence or sex. Just a gorgeous movie. And filmed in a very beautiful part of Canada. You will be touched by this one, perhaps especially if you are in the second half of your life.

James Cromwell plays his role to perfection. Believable every step of the way. I recognized Genevieve Bujold when I first watched it -- she was familiar -- but didn't realize it was her until I looked at reviews online. She is absolutely perfect in her role. You feel the love, the chemistry, the understanding, and the humanness of their marriage, and their family. You pull for them. And the ending scene is especially beautiful and perfect.",1529193600,,932,4.5476190476190474

8592007,4,B00DCS9TP4,Great Flick! Really makes you ponder life and your golden years along with making you think about the over the top regulations that some jurisdictions place upon the people.,1528416000,,173,5.0
8592008,5,B00DCS9TP4,"My lifestyle hasn't allowed for much movie-watching until the last year, and I am sure glad to have run across ""Still Mine"". Didn't know until reading about it afterwards that it was based on a true story. IMO, all of the acting was excellent, but both James Cromwell and Genevieve Bujold were incredible. NO SURPRISE that the film had 7 nominations in the 1st Canadian Screen Awards, and that Cromwell won Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. It was not only a heart-warming (and sometimes gut-wrenching) look inside a marriage, but also an eye-opener to the downside of some government regulation.",1527552000,,610,4.875
