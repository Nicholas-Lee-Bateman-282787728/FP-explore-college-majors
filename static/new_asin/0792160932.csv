135530,4,0792160932,"REVIEWED ITEM: Star Trek  Original Series DVD Volume : Tomorrow is Yesterday  / The Return of the Archons 
TOMORROW IS YESTERDAY  PRELIMINARY BRIEFS:
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: the consequences of messin' 'round with the space-time continuum
Historical Milestone: Star Trek's first full-fledged time-travel episode
Notable Gaffe / Special De-fect: Be on the lookout for a scene where Spock's poppin' a communications earpiece into his noggin with his back facing the camera. If you take a good look at his ears, you can see the lack of craftsmanship in the particular pair he was wearing that day! It was definitely an off-day for the makeup department'
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember ('Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 1 Incapacitated
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: Ah, nothin' like a good time-travel eppie of Star Trek that tries to clear things up about the whole space-time thingy yet leaves you even more confused than ever before! For example, if the abducted Air Force pilot's progeny is going to make so significant a contribution to Earth's future that if he hadn't existed the Federation may not have ever existed, it would... umm... well, see what I mean? It's high time for me to dispense with the temporal mechanics and head into the fun parts of this eppie...
In one of the most unbelievably silly fights ever filmed for network TV, Kirk manages to fend off three US Air Force officers in a scene more reminiscent of the Keystone Kops than Bruce Lee! Putting into consideration the high-quality (*snicker*) choreography of Kirk's previous Star Trek fisticuffs, it's not like it was any big surprise. Speaking of choreograohy, Tomorrow is Yesterday is also one of the series' best showcases of the bridge crew's amazing ability to lean in unison with the lurching ship! Heck, if synchronized leaning were an Olympic sport, all the US would do is send out the original Trek cast to compete! They'd win the gold by an even greater margin than the first couple of US Olympic Basketball Dream Teams did!
THE RETURN OF THE ARCHONS  PRELIMINARY BRIEFS:
Moral, Ethical, and/or Philosophical Subject(s) Driven Into The Ground: The downside of cultural stagnation leading to a soulless society and other excuses for Kirk to ignore Starfleet's Prime Directive
Historical Milestone: Star Trek's first significant 'Kirk-versus-machine' episode
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember ('Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 2 'absorbed', subsequently recovered
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: Seen by many as Gene Roddenberry's commentary about the dangers of conformity in a society, 'Archons' is notable for being the first time Kirk saves the day by talking a computer to 'death'. In this instance, the computer is Landru, a machine that rules and guides a society of seemingly content and happy, yet soulless beings. One particular moment in this episode that really strikes me is the Festival, where the planet's citizenry go berserk and start a riot, complete with people wiggin' out, beatin' up on each other, and storefront windows gettin' smashed! It was likely a disquieting scene to behold for this episode's first viewing audience, what with the Watts riots having occurred a mere two years prior.
Keeping with classic Star Trek's tradition of Kirk interpreting the Prime Directive in a way that suits his own beliefs, Jimbo convinces Landru that it is performing an evil deed by allowing the society that it leads to stagnate. And as one might expect, the master computer eventually self-destructs in a cloud of smoke after the good captain's little soliloquy about how a society needs challenges to overcome and other pro-organic-being rhetoric overloads the machine's logic circuits. Now if I only I could do to the computers of people who keep spamming my e-mail inbox what Jimmers did to Landru, I'd have one less frustration in the world to deal with...

135531,5,0792160932,"Volume 11 of Star Trek contains two classic sci-fi episodes that have both well developed and entertaining plots.  This pair of episodes truly bring out the greatness of the Star Trek Original Series.  Whether it's quirky comical moments in TOMORROW IS YESTERDAY or all out bizarre humanoid behaviour in RETURN OF THE ARCHONS, Volume 11 is sci-fi at it's best.
The first episode here TOMORROW IS YESTERDAY is a personal favourite of mine.  This was one of the first Trek episodes to deal with time travel.  The Enterprise goes into a black hole that takes them back to the late 1960's.  There the crew confronts a US Fighter Pilot and is forced to beam the man aboard after his jet is destroyed by the ship's tractor beam.  The pilot's name is Cpt. Christopher (played by Roger Perry) and Kirk realizes that he cannot return the young Captain to Earth because it may alter the course of time with his knowing of the Enterprise however Cpt. Christopher refuses to stay and tries to escape this leads to more problems on the Enterprise.  The whole time travel plot was fairly good and the man on the moon thing was quite accurate to the timew period: the late 1960's.  Comical moments include Kirk run in with the flirtatious computer as well as the Sgt.'s tour aboard the Enterprise(you'll know what i mean if you have seen the episode).  This truly is a classic!
The other episode here is THE RETURN OF THE ARCHONS.  Kirk and the crew visit a planet ruled by Landru a so called god who controls the minds of his people and punishs those who are not of the body.  The episode has a bizarre yet interesting and enterating plot about mind controlling.  It is so strange when Landru reveals what he actually is but not suprising when you see the way his minions act under his control.  Another classic Trek episode
but I prefer TOMMOROW IS YESTERDAY over this just slightly more.
Overall Volume 11 is a must.  Both Trek episodes have great science fiction elements that make these episodes special.  Truly some of the greater Trek adventures. Highly recommended!",1026172800,2,2058,4.662049861495845
135532,5,0792160932,"Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about. It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites. Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get ""absorbed"".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity. Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming.",1015459200,3,1019,4.730337078651686
135533,4,0792160932,"Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise travel through both time and space to make the universe a better place in the pair of episodes offered upon Volume 11 of the Star Trek DVD series.  For the first time the Enterprise goes back in time in ""Tomorrow is Yesterday,"" thrown back while trying to break free of the gravitational pull of a black hole.  The Enterprise ends up in the late 1960's (neat coincidence, huh?) over the United States, where a jet fighter is scrambled to check out the giant blip on the radar.  Worried about nuclear missiles, Kirk uses the tractor beam to stop the aircraft, which then falls apart.  The Enterprise rescues the pilot, Captain John Christopher, who finds everything (including Spock) a little hard to believe.  Then Kirk discovers he is between a rock and a hard place: they cannot let Christopher return with his knowledge of the future but the officer has to return because his son, who is not yet been conceived, is going to be a famous space explorer.  There are some nice moments in ""Tomorrow is Yesterday,"" having to do with the sudden confrontation of the past and the future, the best of which (Kirk being interrogated by the Military Police) will pop up again in the movie ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.""  I have to admit, I like a time travel episode where the entire fate of the universe does not hang in the balance, as in ""The City on the Edge of Forever.""
""The Return of the Archons"" offers up one of those dystopian societies that the Enterprise stumbled across from time to time.  The Enterprise visits Beta III looking for the Archon, a ship that disappeared 100 years ago.  The away team discovers a population where all the citizens seem drugged until that evening when they all go crazy.  Seeking an explanation from the town's elders, they are told that this is the will of their leader, Landru.  A long time ago the planet was ravaged by war and Landru brought an era of peace and tranquility.  Before he died he programmed a super computer that has been controlling the lives of the people.  Like all computers in the future, this one is doing a horrible job, apparently thinking that by letting the drugged out citizens do a little fighting and looting from time to time will achieve a sense of balance.  I am not particularly impressed by either the society or this episode, especially since this is the first of several times that Kirk will use logic to defeat a computer (come on, Spock never even says, ""Way to go, Jim,"" or anything during these encounters).  The situation is certain spooky enough (think the end of ""6,000,000 Years to Earth""), but the truth behind the mystery is less than satisfactory.",1002758400,,2664,4.638297872340425
135534,4,0792160932,"The two episodes on this DVD are very good. The standout is Return of the  Archons. While it may look cheesy and cheap, it has a very good story.  Also, the humor in this episode and Tomorrow is Yesterday are among the  best moments in the entire series. This is a must have CD.",968198400,3,278,4.111111111111111
135535,5,0792160932,"Well I just finish viewing the Tomorrow is yesterday episode... I remember when i saw it for the first time in the early 80's, and it ""stunted me"". To me this is the most interesting episode because it add humor  to our perpective about the unknown! The theorie of meeting our grand grand  grand generation is a fantastic recepie for a show. This is the only  original series DVD of Star trek that I bought and I was waiting for it! it  does have a similar taste of Voyage home!",961372800,3,478,4.277777777777778
135536,4,0792160932,"You must always remember when watching these DVD's that it was this series that started it all. Sure, modern-day Star Trek fans will see ""flaws"" in logic here with both of these episodes, but  considering that these episodes were the ones which our knowledge was  built, it's a hoot to watch. In Tomorrow is Yesterday, Timeline polution  and time travel paradoxes are present. It is great to see how the episdoe  starts after the initial incident which we do not see. In this episode, I  saw a lot of pavemnt to the fourth Star Trek Film, the Voyage Home. Same  issues in both, sorta same solutions. The transport at the end frankly does  not ""compute"" with me, since even transporting at a certain time  does not replace memory...I think it's a plot hole. I also wonder why they  simply did not just wipe the memory away yet; perhaps it hasn't been  invented until TNG...Also, watch out for the port nascele as the Enterprise  is leaving Earth's orbit. It disappears in the back for a moment, then  fades back in. Yikes! The second episode, The Return of the Archons, is  amusing and fun to watch. Watch for Sulu's initial reactions right before  beam up...It's hysterical. Again, I'm wondering why they simply do not do  more analysis on Sulu before beaming down...Find O'Neil and beam him up.  Clear  violations of the Prime Directive, but Kirk was right...The last  scene with Landrau being destroyed was hokey...anway, still enjoyable.  Overall, the quality of the sound and visual was outstanding...I must have  for all TOS and Trek fans!",960681600,5,1544,4.798479087452471
135537,5,0792160932,"Tomorrow is Yesterday is the first Star Trek episode focusing on time travel and all the paradoxes that entails.  (The Naked Time had a brief time travel sequence, but it was not integral to the plot.)  Guest star  Roger Perry is perfectly cast as John Christopher--a 1969 fish out of water  brought onboard the Enterprise.  (In many ways, he is a 20th Century  version of James T. Kirk)  One prophetic moment is when Uhura tunes into a  radio news summary which reports on the first manned moon shot  ""scheduled for next Wednesday.""  The first moon launch did indeed  take place on a Wednesday!  The use of stock footage in this episode is  very clever and it is well integrated.  The effects shots of the Enterprise  could have been better, but for 1960s television they hold up fairly  well.
The Return of the Archons bears the stamp of Gene Roddenberry.  Many of Roddenberry's best stories focused on mind control and thinly  disguised theocratic societies.  In this case, ""God"" is a  computer (as in the later episode, The Apple) and Kirk ""kills""  God with a dose of overpowering logic.  Both the original series and the  Next Generation dealt with this issue, but this was the first and most  successfull attempt.
Paramount has once again done a fine job of  remastering both sound and picture.  Even the stock footage of Air Force  jets from the 1960s story line has been cleaned up.",959212800,11,1390,4.707112970711297

7791938,5,0792160932,"On the strength of the first ep, I'm giving this one 3 stars.  In this the first full ep with a time travel theme, we have an amusing story of the Enterprise getting inadvertantly thrown back into time to arrive at Earth in the 1960s.  The acting by the guest stars is quite good and overall, the storyline is quite absorbing with a number of humorous bits thrown in.

The theme of the second ep though seems to be a recurring one which keeps cropping up in many guises such as in ""What are Little Girls Made of"" and in ""The Apple"" later where we get machines running the lives of people although with good intentions.  I just didn't seem to be as insightful and original an ep to me and so it just rates as average.

Overall, I'd say this is a good volume to borrow but is not really one you'd go all out to keep.  If you are picking and choosing your volumes to collect, you'd probably not miss this one not being in your collection.",1154304000,,935,4.195530726256983
7791939,5,0792160932,"Tomorrow Is Yesterday is one of the best time-travel episodes in all of Trek.  It follows all the warnings and some of the potential benfits any time travel story has to reckonize.  Too bad they didn't make it the second half of a two-parter along with The Naked Now.  I have to give credit where it's due.  Leonard Nimoy made this point back on the Sci-Fi Channels Star Trek: Special Edition (back in '99 I think).  Anyway, I never forgot the connection of two great stories.
Maybe Return Of The Archons isn't near the top of anybody else's list but I think it's underrated.  The story takes on a great number of ideas, from ""arrested society"" to ""technological domination"".  Despite its flaws it tells a good story.  My favorite gaff is the feeling of discontinuity, or was it bad editing?
I always saw this episode as a 'Spock like computer' forcing its' logic on the 'emotional inhabitants' who probably would have destroyed themselves otherwise.  This to me explains the 6:00 pm mayhem of the people and shows one of the flaws in machines ruling mankind (machines expecting humans to behave like machines).  Remember this the next time you find yourself at a drive-thru ATM.  Who's the boss?",1078790400,4,1196,4.729468599033816
