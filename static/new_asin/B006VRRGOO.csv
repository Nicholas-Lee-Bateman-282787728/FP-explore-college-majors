5021028,5,B006VRRGOO,I love old westerns and was very satisfied with this 4 movie marathon pack featuring James Stewart.  The quality was very good and I'm very happy with this purchase.,1355184000,,165,4.689655172413793

5021030,3,B006VRRGOO,"A lousy picture on most of the movies. Not remastered or enhanced. With my 65"" it was just a blury mess and certainly not worth anything to anyone. It looked like an old old silent movie with a poor pixel look!",1354492800,3,210,4.146341463414634
5021031,4,B006VRRGOO,I have always been a great admirer of James Stewart. He does an excellent job of acting. He is one of my all time favorite actors.,1353715200,,130,4.038461538461538

5021033,5,B006VRRGOO,"This four movie collection is a must for any James Stewart fan. Four 'very good movies', which is not usually the case for multiple movie sets. This one doesn't waste your time, or your money with that nonsense. I got it at a great price too, on Amazon. Buy with confidence. This is a keeper.",1351987200,,292,4.327272727272727
5021034,5,B006VRRGOO,"This is a great set of 4 Westerns starring James Stewart, and at less than $10 is a real bargain to boot!! All 4 movies are well-written and plausible dramas, with good acting and fine production values as well. Another plus of these films is the top-notch actors they contain, including of course James Stewart in all 4, but also Maureen O'Hara, Arthur Kennedy, Julia Adams, Walter Brennan, Ruth Roman, John McIntire, Audie Murphy, and others. I'll want to see these movies repeatedly. None is excessively violent, but with a Western you expect some shoot-outs, right? ""The Rare Breed"" is the most off-beat story of the collection, with Maureen O'Hara and Juliet Mills coming from England to promote a certain breed of cattle in the United States, and as the story implies, there's especially little violence in this one. It's also helpful that all 4 films have optional English subtitles for persons hard-of-hearing, though none have subtitles in any other language.

I can't say for sure whether these movies have been restored, but the picture and sound quality on all run from good to excellent, usually closer to excellent. For some reason ""The Far Country"" is a little grainier than the others. As for the debate among reviewers about the aspect ratios, the ones that are definitely wide-screen (2.35:1) on my TV are ""Night Passage"" and ""The Rare Breed,"" which is as the box states. The box seems to be correct too that ""Bend of the River"" and ""The Far Country"" are in full screen at 1.33:1, although one or both may be at 1.66:1. In the 1950s, when these latter 2 films were made, it was common for films to be shot in 1.33:1 or 1.66:1, so one cannot expect all movies from that era to be widescreen.

In sum, this is a great collection of Westerns, and the price is right!!",1349136000,34,1782,4.6900958466453675
5021035,4,B006VRRGOO,Great set for the price; I love them. I especially like Rare Breed which gives a look into the old west that few would understand if they had not lived in a pioneering period.,1344470400,11,175,4.176470588235294
5021036,5,B006VRRGOO,"This is an awesome set of some of James Stewart westerns; although, this doesn't have Shenandoah and Broken Arrow its still a great collection to have if you don't already have any of these films.

All movies are in color and run about 1hr and 30min each. ""Bend of the River"" is the only one in Full screen format (Yes, the back says ""Far Country"" is in 1.33:1, but apparently they didn't change it for some reason) and ""Night Passage"" and ""The Rare Breed"" are both in Widescreen format (2.35:1) with ""The Far Country"" being 1.85:1 format, which is 16:9. There are two disks and with no double sided disks, so all movies are on one side. There isn't any features on these movies and there is only English for subtitles and language. Since Universal released this, the quality of this is just like buying the movies by themselves.

These movies star of course James Stewart with: Rock Hudson, Audie Murphy, Arthur Kennedy, Julia Adams, Ruth Roman, Maureen O'Hara, Dan Duryea, Brian Keith, Jay C. Flippen, Henry (Harry) Morgan, Walter Brennan and others.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

By the way, I uploaded images of this DVD and the movies that were included by playing it on my computer and doing a printscreen of the movie.

Also, I would recommend this two collections also released by Universal which I also loved:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Movie-Marathon-Classic-Western-Collection-Albuquerque-Whispering-Smith-The-Duel-at-Silver-Creek-War-Arrow/dp/B004GSVX8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Movie Marathon: Classic Western Collection (Albuquerque / Whispering Smith / The Duel at Silver Creek / War Arrow)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Movie-Marathon-Classic-Western-Collection-The-Texas-Rangers-Canyon-Passage-Kansas-Raiders-The-Lawless-Breed/dp/B00575GYUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Movie Marathon: Classic Western Collection (The Texas Rangers / Canyon Passage / Kansas Raiders / The Lawless Breed)</a>",1331942400,101,2030,6.367272727272727

5021070,4,B006VRRGOO,"BEND OF THE RIVER (1952)

""Bend of the River"" stars James Stewart as wagon master, Glyn McLyntock, who leads pioneers to a remote settlement near Mount Hood, Oregon. When a profit-minded Portland boss confiscates the settlers' winter supplies due to a gold rush, McLyntock teams-up with a good-natured-but-dubious gunman (Arthur Kennedy) and a gentleman gambler (Rock Hudson) to get the supplies to them. Harry Morgan & Royal Dano are on hand as ne'er-do-wells while Julie Adams, Lori Nelson and Frances Bavier appear in feminine roles.

This was the second of five Westerns Mann did with Stewart. These were uncompromisingly harsh, psychological Westerns featuring themes of revenge, obsession, rage and redemption. They were spectacularly shot on location, rather than in the studio, providing a backdrop of authentic rugged beauty. In this film you'll often see Mount Hood looming in the distance.

A lot of action & events are crammed into an hour and a half, which is great for action fans or those with ADHD. Take, for instance, the opening campout sequence where the Natives waste little time in attacking; or the saloon scene where someone gets fatally shot within minutes. I'm not complaining because I enjoy muscular action, but the downside is that the movie lacks the mundaneness of real life in the Old West. That said, it's highly realistic in that it shows you how tough it was for settlers. Take, for instance, the rough, bumpy trails the wagons had to traverse.

In any case, this is a dynamic, tough, psychological early 50's Western with James Stewart. It's atypical and original (although people say it has similarities to 1946' ""Canyon Passage, which I've never seen). You just have to acclimate to some old-fashioned hokey elements.

THE FAR COUNTRY (1954)

""The Far Country"" stars Jimmy Stewart as a self-centered cattleman, Jeff Webster, who conflicts with a crooked, self-appointed lawman (John McIntire) while driving cattle through Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson during the 1896 Klondike gold rush. Ruth Roman plays a formidable woman he meets on the steamship, who unfortunately works for Gannon (McIntire). Walter Brennan plays Jeff's best friend while Corinne Calvet plays a tough foreign settler with romantic inclinations.

This was the fourth of five Westerns Mann did with Stewart. These were uncompromisingly harsh, psychological Westerns featuring themes of revenge, obsession, rage and redemption. They were spectacularly shot on location, rather than in the studio, providing a backdrop of authentic rugged beauty. This one was shot in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada, with one episode involving Athabasca Glacier.

The opening sequence on the steamship is memorable for the way Jeff (Stewart) escapes ship authorities with the assistance of Ruth Roman's character. Roman is stalwart, stunning and surprisingly vivacious (for her role as a woman in the rough NW wilderness). Gannon (McIntire) is an interesting antagonist due to the way he joyfully basks in his power and overt corruption.

NIGHT PASSAGE (1957)

""Night Passage"" stars Jimmy Stewart as a fired railroad man rehired and trusted to secretly carry a $10,000 payroll, even though he is suspected of being connected to outlaws (whose leader is played by Dan Duryea). One of the outlaws happens to be his younger brother, the Utica Kid (Audie Murphy). Dianne Foster and Elaine Stewart are on hand in the feminine department.

People say ""Night Passage"" is akin to Anthony Mann's 50's Westerns, but that's a bunch of hooey. True, Mann was originally slated to direct it, but he declined because he felt the script was lousy, arguing that nobody would understand it. He also thought it would be a stretch to have the 5'5""Audie Murphy play the brother of 6'3"" James Stewart. While the height of the two actors is inconsequential (many families have a 'runt' in the litter, so what?), Mann was deadly accurate about the story, which is too talky and absurdly over-plotted. The story's so unnecessarily complicated that it doesn't work up any steam until the last 12 minutes, although there are a few quality moments here and there.

Mann's ""Bend of the River"" (1952), ""The Far Country"" (1954), ""The Man from Laramie"" (1955) and the outstanding ""The Last Frontier ""(1955) are all infinitely superior to ""Night Passage."" Yet it's not just an issue of a convoluted screenplay, although that's the main problem, ""Night Passage"" is also marred by old-fashioned hokeyness that those Mann flicks generally elude. The opening dance sequence and Stewart's occasional warbling with the accordion are two examples, although I could live with both if the story were compelling. Still, there's enough good here to maybe make it worth watching for those who don't mind 50's Westerns, such as the mind-blowing Elaine Stewart, the magnificent train, the scenic locations and the action sequences, like the climax.

THE RARE BREED (1966)

""The Rare Breed"" chronicles events in St. Louis and Texas in 1884-85 when an English woman (Maureen O'Hara) and her daughter (Juliet Mills) conscript a lanky cattleman (James Stewart) to try and get their hornless British bull to mate with the longhorns of Texas, but they have to deal with venal thugs (Jack Elam), a curmudgeon ranch mogul (Brian Keith) and the harshness of nature itself.

The film meshes drama with lighthearted amusement in the manner of a screwball Disney family comedy, fun brawls reminiscent of John Wayne Westerns of that era, dead-serious sequences and romance. I didn't feel this inconsistent tone marred the movie; after all, doesnt real life include all of these things? The exception would be the fun brawling scenes which, while lively, are not true to life. In real fights people get broken noses, black eyes, bruises and broken bones. Anyway, the cast is great, but I didn't find the drama that engaging, especially the entire last act. Furthermore, the indoor sets substituting for outdoors are obvious and smack of old-fashioned movies & TV Western fare of the time period.

About a third of the way in theres an exceptional stampede sequence that includes a heart-stopping on-set accident involving the wagon carrying Martha (OHara) and Hilary (Mills) ahead of the stampede. The stunt women were supposed to be thrown clear, but the wagon rolled over them. Thankfully, the dipping ground underneath the wagon allowed the stuntwomen, Stephanie Epper and Patty Elder, enough room to survive without being crushed, although they did experience minor wounds and shock. In the same sequence a young man is forced to try to run UP the canyon wall in stark terror as the charging cattle threaten.",1506988800,2,6643,5.171322160148976

5021197,5,B006VRRGOO,"You get four entertaining James Stewart westerns in sharp, vivid color for five bucks! I was delighted by the quality condition of all the films. As for the content quality, I will rate them accordingly:
Best overall- Bend of the River. Too bad it is presented in fullscreen, a relic of last century. Stewart is in his prime and it has an outstanding cast.
Most original- The Rare Breed. The plot kind of moseys along, but Maureen O'Hara adds sparkle to the trail.
Most overused plotline- Night Passage. Warning lights begin to flash when Stewart draws his...accordian and plaintively wails something about the railroad. This happens several times during the cliche ""good brother saves the bad brother"" plot and serves as a forerunner of the chill in the spine one got every time George Segal would pull out his banjo on the Tonite Show many years later.
Most ornery Jimmy- The Far Country. Stewart is a true bad-ass in this one. Magnificent vistas of wild Canada from a half century ago co-star with him and Walter Brennan is doing his lovable, old geezer sidekick schtick with a vengeance.
Who knew five bucks would go so far in the 21st century?",1447804800,12,1148,4.745

He's not the only star who does that, but his odd choppy speech patterns and limited facial expressions irritate when viewed again and again as happens in watching four of his movies in a row.  I read his biography. The truth seems to be that he is an ordinary rather boring guy that most people like because he seems to be ""one of us.""

5021244,5,B006VRRGOO,"Four splendid James Stewart  Universal westerns in this great value for money 2-disc package.
Not classics but just darn fine films, superb entertainment and generally critically under appreciated.  There are two excellent Anthony Mann films:  ""Bend of the River""  (featuring a marvellous music score by Hans J. Salter including a fabulous theme) and ""The Far Country"" and an equally good James Neilson directed venture ""Night Passage""  with a fine Dimitri Tiomkin score highlighted by the catchy ""Follow the River"" song.  All three films were written by famous western screenwriter Borden Chase.  The final film ""The Rare Breed"" is a much later Stewart effort, an unusual western dealing with cattle breeding, with a heavy emphasis on comedy.
One of the best things about James Stewart's Universal films of the fifties is the reliably high standard production values and wonderful casts.  Hard to go wrong with actors of the caliber of Arthur Kennedy, Dan Duryea, Jay C. Flippen, John McIntire, Henry Morgan, Ellen Corby and the young Brandon de Wilde leading a host of character actors in support and often over shadowing the lead actors.",1432425600,3,1140,5.191256830601093

5021272,5,B006VRRGOO,"Director Andrew V. McLaglen's THE RARE BREED is a western I always liked. I saw it when I was in 6th grade in 1966 and just loved it. This western has more of a wholesome family feel to it than many of James Stewart's previous westerns. The beautiful cinematography was by William H. Clothier. The great cast included Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, Juliet Mills, Ben Johnson, Jack Elam and Harry Carey, Jr. This film even had a memorable score composed by John Williams. I will never forget Vindicator!
1952's BEND OF THE RIVER is a solid rough and tumble James Stewart Western directed by Anthony Mann. Gold rush or not, you have to eat and survive in the wilderness and that takes supplies, but somebody always wants to take advantage of the situation. This is a hard nosed Western with a great story of the Western genre. The cast is strong and solid and includes Arthur Kennedy, Julie Adams, Rock Hudson, Jay C. Flippen, Harry Morgan and Royal Dano. Glyn McLyntock (James Stewart), ""I thought we were out of Cheyenne country. What do you make of that?"" Nobody said it was going to be easy.
1954's THE FAR COUNTRY is probably my favorite James Stewart Western. There's something about the story that I really like. James Stewart and his sidekick Walter Brennan decide to drive a herd of cattle to Dawson City in the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush. However, on the way they run up against John McIntire, a self-appointed judge and he takes the herd of cattle away from them and he has the henchmen to back that up. What I like about this movie is the setting, some of the film was shot in Athabasca Glacier and Jasper National Park in Canada, and John McIntire's performance. This is one of those movies where you really want to see the bad guy get his comeuppance. Stewart and Brennan steal back their cattle and cross over into Canada. McIntire will be waiting for them when they return. ""Have a nice trip! I'll hang you when you come back!"" THE FAR COUNTRY was directed by Anthony Mann with beautiful and effective cinematography by William H. Daniels. The great cast also includes Ruth Roman, Jay C. Flippen, Harry Morgan, Corinne Calvet, Robert J. Wilke, Jack Elam and Royal Dano. Grubstake. I will never forget that term.
1957's NIGHT PASSAGE directed by James Neilsonis is an excellent hard edged James Stewart Western. This film has the feel of earlier James Stewart Westerns directed by Anthony Mann. It was shot in Technirama and Technicolor and the autumnal cinematography by William H. Daniels is vivid and very brilliant. Audie Murphy is excellent as The Utica Kid and is another asset to this Western in addition to the railroad scenes shot in Durango, Colorado at the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad. The great score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. James Stewart as Grant McLaine is hired to deliver a 10,000 dollar payroll for the railroad because the railroad deliveries have been getting robbed by Dan Duryea's gang. The only problem is that James Stewart may or may not have ties to the gang.",1424476800,,3027,4.713207547169811

Next, we have The Man From Laramie, I don't remember a lot about that film but it was good. Next, Night Passage, one of my favorites on this disc co starring Audie Murphy. And lastly, The Rare Breed, with Maureen O' Hara (a delightful western comedy). I definitely think you should get this. It's totally worth it and the price is fantastic.

The epic films portray the grandour and splender of the Old West with it's colorful characters and majetic scenes. Mr. Stewart a war veteran combat pilot is perfect as the everyday cowboy working hard and trying to do what is right for himself and others connected to him. His honesty is abused by a collection of would be evildoers.,1400630400,,437,4.688311688311688

5021361,5,B006VRRGOO,"Four westerns staring Jimmy Stewart,  the one man who can protect those in need. Each movie has a great supporting cast.  Bend in the river has Rock Hudson, Harry Morgan ( Col. Potter on MASH), Francis Bavier, ( Aunt Bea), Arthur Kennedy and Royal Dano.  It's full of western action  and great shoot outs.  Never mess with Jimmy Stewart.  In The Far Country we have Stewart teams up with Walter Brennan moving cattle to Alaska.  We also get great performances, from Harry Morgan, Jack Elam and Royal Dano.  Mr. Dano has one of those movies you never forget, He voiced Disney's Lincoln at the Lincoln exhibit. We get more shoot outs,  crooked law men and lots of horses. In the Rare Breed, Stewart helps heard cattle for a widow woman and her daughter. We also get great supporting performances from the great team of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. To round out the cast we have Maureen O'Hara, Jack Elam and Juliet Mills.  In Night Passage Stewart and Audie Murphy are at Odds while Jimmy protects Gold this time. Jack Elam turns up again.
