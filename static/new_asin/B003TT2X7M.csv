4192680,4,B003TT2X7M,"As a lot of other online reviewers have stated, this movie is very derivative and the story is very unoriginal. That said, this movie was still enjoyable and worth watching..especially if you are into sci-fi and time travel stories. I know! It seems like I am contradicting myself, but let me see if I can clarify. Here is a list of the positives of the film and why I gave it 4 stars:
1. Lance Henriksen - he is such an awesome actor. The movie would have been a total failure without him. He really sells his performance.  I wish he had become a bigger name in Hollywood. At least he was in some of my favorite movies (Aliens and Terminator)
2. Lack of overdone special fx. While not a total success, this movie shows how good sci-fi doesn't have to rely on tons of special effects. Heck, most modern sci-fi movies have no story or thought whatsoever. They just use the genre to showcase explosions and cgi.
3. This plays out like an old Isaac Asimov short story...which is very good. However, It should have dealt more into the mechanics and physics of time travel. The science in this movie is extremely limited, basic, and generic. Nothing was brought to the table that hasn't been covered in half an episode of Star Trek.

****SPOILER*****
The fact that the main character didn't recognize himself from the future was the biggest key in breaking the film. Also, the actors don't look anything alike, nor do they sound alike. Your voice doesn't change that much over time, especially when you are talking about someone with such an awesome and distinctive voice as Lance Henriksen. Perhaps they should have had Lance come back in disguise so as to give a plausible explanation as to why his younger self wouldn't recognize him.
 Overall, I enjoyed the movie and recommend it for a casual viewing. It is not a movie that I ever see myself watching again. I do like and admire what they were trying to do with this film and give them kudos for the effort, but it fell somewhat flat.",1362528000,3,1985,4.539106145251397

4192684,3,B003TT2X7M,"The story starts out with delicious, tantalyzing indicators that it is going to be one of those excellent little independant films that comes along occasionally and threatens to tell us big truths.
But the threat is never made good on because the writer (direct, producer, Nicholas Gyeney) hasn't gone far enough in his thinking to take us anywhere.
Lance Henrikson is the one bright spot, making his character and the story believable as long as he is talking, and showing real depth and nuance.
 Lathrop Walker, local Seattle actor, just doesn't have enough of a character to work with and ends ups being whiney and sad....and, well... whiney.
I hope this writer takes this up again in a few years. I have a feeling he does have a story to deliver when he puts the pieces together.",1343520000,5,783,4.7153284671532845
4192685,1,B003TT2X7M,"First, no one wrote this. Someone consulted Bartlett's book of Famous Quotations, then converted them into generic cliches and strung them together to make ""dialog"".

And there is nothing wrong with talking head pictures (my dinner with Andre) but said dialog is now combined with basic camera work to make for an incredibly boring first half of the movie.

And the plot is so familiar you can ""guess"" the secret almost at the beginning.

I think the scene designer is owed a lot of kudos because the look and colors are imaginative.",1343174400,,533,4.771739130434782
4192686,5,B003TT2X7M,"Every once in a while, I come across a movie that jerks me out of my normal hollywood funk (""hollywood funk""-the effects of watching various movies with virtually the same storyline repeatedly as if the plots were recycled for long periods of time) and reminds me what movies can be if enough thought, creativity, acting, care, and other special qualities are poured into the film.  ""The Penitent Man"" is one of those movies and and it's a relief because it's been a long, funky, dry spell.

The movie has no special effects.  It has no explosions or car chases or stunts of any kind.  What this movie does have is superb acting (highlighted in this category is Lance Henrikson as he was in top form), strong scenes, creativity, and a great amount of story and imagination.

I won't give anything away but you should give it a little over a half an hour.  If you don't like it by then, well...you'll know by then.  I strongly recommend this film for whatever my recommendation is worth.",1313020800,28,986,4.6

The only thing slow was that persons mind to even conceive of such a possibility and have the imagination to make it come real in their own minds.  It had a story of time travel to spin.

4192693,4,B003TT2X7M,"Lance Henriksen is the man. Always loved his acting.
It's a science fiction/psychological drama.  It's definitely slow, so you have to be in the mood to watch a great actor do his thing. The supporting actors ranged from good to beginner, as would be expected in a small, indie film.

The story line was only surprising in that someone either grew or shrank (you'll see what I mean). Also, when someone starts waving a gun around and you have an open doorway inches from you, wouldn't you dive into it? Or at least get your body inside then peek around the corner.

I almost stopped it when the loony left conspiracies and ""Everyone who bases the Universe on God is a fool"" crap started. Apparently the world started to end when they time viewed Jesus and discovered he was ""only a man"" and troglodyte Christians refused to believe it. No mention about when they tried to tell Muslims that Muhammad was ""only a man"".

The young actor playing Ovid was quite believable and interesting to watch. My attention was drawn away from the story and to the acting because the central couple, Dr and Mrs psychologist, struggled visibly with their roles. In my view, their poor acting ruined the film.

This is not a movie that relies on sex scenes, exploding stars or 20 minute car chases through downtown that can be mindlessly taken in by the cookie cutter visual stimuli movie fans.  In fact, I was doing something else, wearing the bluetooth headphones rarely looking at the screen for the first hour and easily stayed with the movie.  Gotta be a good listener and able to turn your brain on for this one, and if you can do that you'll see it is an in-depth take on the Grandfather Paradox, but presented with a sly twist.  If you are the what if type, it's worth a look at the first parts and the last parts.  Most of the middle, you can get onto something else with your 'phones  or 'buds hooked in.

There are plenty other good films worth watching. It surprises me that films this bad get funded.",1494720000,,386,4.5285714285714285
4192704,1,B003TT2X7M,"Poorly paced; terribly shot.

This is a great case study on how not to shoot a film. When you're watching this movie, you'll have a persistent feeling that something is off. That's because the cinematography is consistently poor. The lighting isn't dynamic. The framing is poor. The whole production has a very paint-by-numbers feel to it. It's really the most humdrum thing you've ever seen put to film. Shots go on way too long, and tend to be either too far away, or too damn close. The camera is literally just being jerked back and forth during action scenes. It's incompetent. It's BAD cinematography.

This is a shame, because the actors are really trying here. There are some good performances, but you'd never know it because the director doesn't know how to line up compelling shots, and the editor is out to lunch. I know most moviegoers don't consider the technical aspects of film making, but it really makes a huge difference in the final product. Take some time to actually examine the anatomy of any given scene. It will become immediately obvious to you.

On top of all this, the pacing of the story is so damn slow, you could fall asleep for 20 minutes and not miss anything significant. Maybe that's great if you're looking for a movie to just play in the background while you multitask, but how anyone could sit down and devote their entire attention to this is beyond me.",1494115200,,1392,4.673469387755102

4192706,1,B003TT2X7M,"This movie is a slow-moving after-school special that's also creepy. Everything about it is lame, from the sleep-inducing music to the stilted dialogue (One character even speaks without using contractions. Yep, like a robot.) to the pedestrian acting to the thoroughly overdone time-travel scenario of---SPOILER ALERT---going back in time to warn yourself. I kept hoping I was wrong, so I stuck with it to the end. Or is it the end? Maybe time is a continuous loop, and I'm doomed to watch this drivel again tomorrow.",1490918400,,518,5.034883720930233

I often become bored with the high action, low philosophical, very little dialogue movie formulas in modern science fiction.  This movie held my attention all the way through.

Lance Henriksen (the actor who played the android on Aliens) was wonderful. He totally pulled me into the story and the story was very good. The rest of the acting was only so-so.

For those viewers seeking fast-paced flashy effects, wild fight scenes and basic sound enhancement of gunfire and other audio available in every trite film since Y2K, you'll be disappointed in the quiet reflective nature and slow progression of the plot. This lack of enhancement makes it feel more real, complete with street sounds and absence of a lot of soundtrack. While some of the acting demonstrates inexperience - most of the actors are young, Henriksen has more than enough polish and craft to carry the film where the acting is weak. (Go Richard III!) In all, It's a nice film that any thinking person would like on a quiet afternoon.",1483660800,,816,4.835714285714285

There was a merchant in Bagdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trembling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the marketplace I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death that jostled me.  She looked at me and made a threatening gesture,  now, lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate.  I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me.  The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went.  Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he saw me standing in the crowd and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning?  That was not a threatening gesture, I said, it was only a start of surprise.

Henriksen is charming, interesting, and a fantastic storyteller- which is good because his telling of the story IS the story of the film. Unfortunately, despite a great scifi concept, the other actors in the movie are pretty terrible. The camera work changes from amateurish to expert. Overall, fundamentally uneven, but also bold in that it tackles a traditional science fiction concept and explores its ramification through a philosophical conversation. No wild visual effects, no flash cuts to the future, just Lance Henriksen's Mr. Darrell talking to his friend/psychologist, played by Lathrop Walker who is, in fact, an abysmal actor. The ""reveal"" is telegraphed very early and the ending is laughably bad and full of logical holes- ironically, none of which have to do with the often inscrutable subject of time travel. It is also notable that the end is devoid of Henriksen and thus anything resembling a credible performance. Watch at your own risk, though again Lance Henriksen's presence and delivery is great.",1371168000,,1238,5.257575757575758
4192836,2,B003TT2X7M,"Henrikson does a stellar turn as the titular character, but the lead played by Lathrop Walker is so flat and lacking in emotional depth that even Henrikson can't save the piece.

The story is nice but limited, a clever conceit with potential that isn't expanded sufficiently to seriously engage the viewer.  In a film that works primarily as a conversation piece to ask interesting questions on the nature of time travel, you need a strong and nuanced performance by the two individuals in the conversation.  Henrikson is brilliant, but Walker is distracting in his lack of acting acumen.

With Lathrop dragging the movie down, even decent work by Melissa Walker and Andrew Keegan is overshadowed.

Nicholas Gyeney was the producer, director and writer, but what he really needed was someone professional to cast the piece.

As an indy I'd give it a C.  It could have been much, much better.",1366243200,2,891,4.9
8405432,4,B003TT2X7M,"This is the second time I've watched this film. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but a great idea and good script. The acting is a little weak at times during the weepy scenes, but being emotional and crying in any film has to be one of the hardest things to do for any actor. I still highly recommend the movie.........",1528588800,,320,4.17741935483871
8405433,2,B003TT2X7M,"I've always enjoyed Lance Henriksen in sci-fi and space fantasy and horror flicks over the decades, but I can't rally behind this film.  It's incredibly slow and not very imaginative, revisiting science fiction notions of time travel, causality, alternate timelines and Fate that were original and thought-provoking 60 years ago, but that seem banal and boring today.

A young psychotherapist is jolted by a final session with an elderly patient who not only claims he's from the future, but who claims he personally destroyed human civilization in the future through the invention of a time portal.  Apparently, this enigmatic old guy has nobly traveled back in time to avert the decline of humanity.

Aaaaand, you guessed it, the elderly patient actually IS the young psychotherapist, trying to warn himself away from time-related experimentation.  Hey, it's not a spoiler if you can already predict the entire plot (including its ""surprise ending"") only 20 minutes into the film, okay?

As mentioned, I can always appreciate Lance Henriksen, with his expressive features and low-key acting style, in any role; but this mopey, dialogue-driven fantasy drama (devoid of special effects, by the way) is like an overly-talkative ""My Dinner with Ray Bradbury,"" featuring a lengthy and superficial discussion on the dangers of tampering with the space-time continuum.

Frankly, this long-winded cautionary tale feels like it was written by a 13-year-old in a creative writing class...and I think it was.  But at least it's pleasant to hear Henriksen's voice droning on, even though he actually says nothing.",1528243200,,1603,5.333333333333333
8405434,4,B003TT2X7M,"This movie goes to prove that a really qualified actor can save an otherwise poorly made film. Lance Henriksen's performance elevated this movie above the poor acting, stiff dialog, inexperienced directing, and ""gotcha"" plot that becomes obvious too soon.

I'm not sure I'll watch it again, or put it on my ""best movie"" list. But I do not begrudge the time I spent watching it.",1528156800,,377,4.8
8405435,1,B003TT2X7M,"I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half watching this! The acting is so stiff and stilted. I bet they didn't spend 500$ on the set and props. The storyline, with some work, could be saved, the premise is full of possibility. Honestly, it felt like I was watching my ninth grade play. I wonder what it would look like with actual good actors? We'll never know. Don't do what I did, watch all the terrible overacting, hoping it will turn into something decent. It never does, save your time, you won't regret it.",1527465600,,514,4.364583333333333
