1671899,3,B00005V4Y4,"If you've ever watched MAD TV, they do some spoofs off of this series, which include many of the ""problems"" named in some of the above reviews.
The skit has horrible acting, silly rhymes, stupid villains, an unsteady camera, and just overall... heh, you get the point.  Collector shows such as these sometimes get their ""fame"" on these grounds.
I cannot exactly recommend this, though =)",1081036800,4,387,4.863636363636363
1671900,5,B00005V4Y4,"Ok I think this is really a horrible movie.  The plot is the pimp drug dealer gets freed from jail to get a worse pimp drug dealer.
This is the primer for our cheesy movie night because no matter what we watch after this one it has to be better and usually is.
THe action sequences are horribly choreographed.  the plot is horrendous.  But somehow Dolemite seems to be abe to rhyme all his lines.  This is probably not the movie for everyone and if you have never seen Dolemite before I would recommend renting it before you buy it to see if it is something you want in your collection.  As for me I take the good with the bad.",1072224000,11,627,4.148760330578512

1671991,5,B00005V4Y4,"I enjoyed all of the Dolemite movies, with my favorite being Disco Godfather!

1671992,5,B00005V4Y4,"Way Down in the Jungle deep, the lion stepped on the signifying monkeys feet. For those that do not know of Rudy Ray Moore, he was a foul mouthed, profanity uttering character. But oh, how he entertained you with his tales.  The acting in the movies was kind of corny meant to amuse those watching and it accomplished that purpose, Rudy was entertaining.  No collection is complete without having this set of CD's.",1389830400,3,414,4.657534246575342

1671999,5,B00005V4Y4,"The box set was an excellent birthday gift for my 17 y/o son. He saw the movie Black Dynamite earlier this year and thought it was funny. The gift gave him background knowledge of where some of the dialogue was based.

The bell bottoms add colorful leisure suits viewed much better on DVD than the VHS tapes I watched as a child. As an adult now I recieved so much more insight into the economic times and culture of the 70s.

Rudy Raymore has always been funny to me. The movies gave me and my son something else to bond over, especially now that he is about to leave for college.",1288656000,20,581,4.225225225225225

1672002,5,B00005V4Y4,"a collection of Rudy Ray moore. An entertainer who paved the way for : cosby, pryor, chapelle,and murphy.",1238630400,3,105,4.888888888888889
1672003,5,B00005V4Y4,"many of these reviews seem to miss the boat.  rudy ray moore was, and is, a legend - he did more with less than anyone ever has in hollywood (except MAYBE for ed wood, jr) - and has left a legacy with ripples that will extend far, far into the future.  he may not have 'invented' rap, but he sure advanced it, and probably did accidentally create the modern 'gangsta' persona, first with his stand-up and later thru 'dolemite' : rhyming his lines, being the baddest-a$$ mutha around (even though he was well north of 30 and not exactly in peak physical condition when the first movie was released).

are any of his movies ""good"" in a textbook sense?  no.  absolutely not!  somehow, i don't think they'd be anywhere near as much fun if they were.  he had zero budget, zero funding, zero corporate backing - and yet he, through his movies and force of character, has created a cult of personality that will very likely outlast everyone reading this review.  to criticize any of rudy's movies by comparing them to, basically, ANYTHING else is to completely miss the point: they are NOT like anything else, there is NO comparison to be made!

highest possible recommendation for fans of blaxploitation, vintage hong kong action cinema (shaw brothers, etc), the psychotronic film genre (or mega-genre, or sub-genre, or whatever you want to call it), anything released by something weird video, movies that can be made into drinking games (these are ripe with possibilities!), or anyone looking for a no-frills good time experience with their dvd player and a few like-minded friends.  open mind and broad sense of humor required!",1236816000,58,1624,4.809352517985611
1672004,2,B00005V4Y4,"Only enjoyable if you like Blaxploitation movies from the seventies. I purchased this collection for my husband being that he has told me for almost thirty years about the movies that he used to go see as a kid.  Well, now that I've seen them, I can understand why they may have a cult following.  However, if you are looking for Academy Award performances, look elsewhere.  Even if you're looking for a story line...look elsewhere.  Rudy Ray Moore, may he rest in peace, still has a following till this day.  This movie definitely started....something.  My two stars are for effort!",1234742400,3,583,4.78

1672007,4,B00005V4Y4,Dolemite Rudy Ray Moore truly did something that no other Comedian had ever done&that was Rapping His Lines. he will crack you up from start to finish.the films were basic but they hit home with me&My friends.

7956103,3,B00005V4Y4,"For the purpose of this review my opinion is valid.
This set has 4 films not 7 and for the record if the review was for those 4 it would have been 5 stars not 3.
Doloemite, The Human Tornado, Petey Wheatstraw, & Disco Godfather.
I do not do movie reviews except 3-D on the quality of the 3-D not anything. having to do with what critics
critique.
Music and film are a matter of taste so only the fans matter
The other 3 disk are a special features interviews etc., a couple of stand up acts, and Rudy Rays musical return concert as a senior.
None of the other Dolemite films are with this.
Its a shame really.",1493251200,,609,4.126050420168068
