8500550,3,B006M0MKE6,I enjoyed this movie. It had some funny parts. Both Silvia Navarro (huge fan of hers) and Jorge Salinas are great actors and they did a good job. I just wished that the movie was a bit longer and showed a little more of the woman's perspective on the subject.,1334534400,,259,4.2
