2871092,5,B000ROA01S,"This bundle of a few Natural History documentaries (by the genius BBC) is a must for anyone who's intrigued by our world's nature and natural history. Although quite expensive by Amazon.com terms, you do get a bunch of documentaries that may otherwise turn out to be more expensive when bought individually. The 'Congo' series is a unique and rare documentary about one of the least visited areas in the world. It gives you a rare glimpse into the Congo Basin and helps you understand its natural history a little better. I wish this series comprised more than (only...) 3 episodes! Furthermore, the series about Africa in general, gives you an idea of the complexity and uniqueness of the African continent. I'd also recommend the series about Europe and the 'first Eden'. Although I've been living in Europe for over 15 years now, I never realized how special and interesting the ecology and natural history of this continent actually is. That is until I watched these two documentaries! Well, I think this review says it all... It's a true must-see for any nature lover.",1312502400,,1073,4.868852459016393
2871093,5,B000ROA01S,"I'm not sure why this Africa feature is packaged with a DVD about European wildlife. Regardless, the Africa portion of this documentary is great. Each episode covers a different ecosystem on the African continent. The episodes discuss the environmental changes that have given rise to each species. I prefer looking at individual ecosystems on one continent rather than the ""flying around the world"" approach of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>. With that said, this documentary is much older than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth/dp/B000MR9D5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth</a>&nbsp;(first produced in the late 1980s), so it simply doesn't have the HD quality viewers are used to. Regardless, there are still some amazing scenes, such as sea lions sneaking up on gannets in the water and hippos fighting each other with bloody jaws. Also, the enhanced mode is actually informative and not too intrusive, mentioning interesting facts about the animals. Definitely worth checking out.",1249344000,5,1161,6.958904109589041
2871094,5,B000ROA01S,I have been to all mentioned in the doc....and it is as good as being there..(almost).  So...if your stuck here-and want to travel there...GO FOR IT!!!!!,1241740800,,153,4.884615384615385
2871095,4,B000ROA01S,"It might seem somewhat petty to withhold a 5-star rating from this set for one complaint, but for people buying this chiefly for David Attenborough's ""The First Eden,"" it's a pretty big complaint: It's not complete. The 4th episode, ""Strangers in the Garden,"" is not included -- at least nowhere that I can find. Very strange, considering there are so many extra documentaries; you're not merely getting the four main programs, but also shows about the Nile, Madagascar (mainly lemurs), Scandinavia, and Iceland. Couldn't one of them have been left out to make room for the final episode of ""The First Eden?"" Or even better, would it have been that much more trouble to spread ""The First Eden"" over two discs and supplement it with another documentary like they did with the other programs?

Other than that one problem, this set is magnificent. If you liked ""Planet Earth"" and/or the various Attenborough ""Life..."" series, you can't miss with this set. At over 1000 minutes, this what you call bang for your buck. Don't hesitate, unless you're only interested in getting the complete ""First Eden.""",1201996800,27,1098,4.967391304347826
2871096,4,B000ROA01S,"I knew prior to ordering this set, sight unseen, that it would be very good but it surpassed my expectations. The BBC is probably the foremost producer of outstanding nature documentaries and in this series lies the proof. The BBC Atlas explores how geology, and human history among other factors formed the Continents as we know them today. It covers how humans altered and adapted to life in Africa and Europe with fabulous visuals and amazing photography. Ranging from pre-history right up to the 21st century we see how man and animals have co-existed through the ages and adapted to the environment as it has gone thru various changes. All the various narrators of segments are excellent, especially Sir David Attenborough. I highly recommend both sets.",1196553600,18,758,5.023809523809524
2871097,5,B000ROA01S,"Great documentary on Africa and Europe. If you like natural history, this would be a must get video",1194220800,4,99,4.555555555555555
8201721,4,B000ROA01S,"This is a series of BBC films about nature in Africa and Europe and each is a stand alone. There is an Atlas of the Western Hemisphere which covers North, Central and South America. It is about the interaction of animals with nature and the interaction of humans and nature in Africa, the Mediterrean and European landscapes. I enjoyed the beautiful cinematography, focus on long term changes resulting from human and natural actions. There is a bonus disc which provides in-depth specials on the Nile Madagascar, Scandinavia and Iceland. Natural History at its best.",1522454400,,567,5.042553191489362

8201723,3,B000ROA01S,"would be perfect but one disc (Congo) never  played so............the other 5 discs are wonderful as is this whole series from the BBC. I was overwhelmed by material and this disc went into a 'later' column and then I spaced it. I have other parts of this series and I only need a S.America, I think. either way: BBC rules !!!",1452124800,,326,4.344262295081967

8201726,2,B000ROA01S,"Hugely disappointing.  Might have been a more accurate description to call it a History of the Worlds Beginnings or something.  I found the majority of this incredibly boring.  I purchase the nature DVD's, to watch and learn about large animals, in particular, and watch them several times over.  I'm having trouble getting through this one and I'd have to be pretty bored before I watched it again.",1420243200,,399,4.91044776119403
8201727,5,B000ROA01S,Wonderful set...it's not only nature but history....one of the best of the BBC.  I think I own almost all of the BBC nature DVDs...this is a good price for 30 hours of entertainment.,1406419200,3,182,4.515151515151516
8201728,5,B000ROA01S,These BBC Atlas series are very good and my only child and I love to set down watch these series together.,1391731200,,106,4.095238095238095
8201729,5,B000ROA01S,"I ordered this video because I love to watch wildlife, and I loved it. I don't know how to do the half a star so I went & went ahead and did a 5 star. The only thing about this video is that the music kind of covers the narration, the narration is kind of weak. That's the only thing I have to say about this video. I love this otherwise. Now I'm not going to tell about what's in it or how it is, or tell about what episodes are in there, the titles are already on the product description when you look at it. This is a great wildlife video, otherwise I would write something else. You won't regret it, I promise. Buy it, and have a great time watching it over and over again.",1356134400,,677,3.948905109489051
8201730,5,B000ROA01S,Well worth the price if you like this genre. Really good videography and the narration is informative. The Scenery and wildlife are extraordinary.,1351209600,,146,5.391304347826087
