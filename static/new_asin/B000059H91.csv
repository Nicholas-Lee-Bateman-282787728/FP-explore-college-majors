For example, Ford helped develop the assembly line but he was against the $5 a day wage.  This was recommended by his president because turnover increased to 900% when the assembly line was introduced as human labor was being ""dumbed out"" so to speak.
2) I found many of the topics hit from a very high perspective.
3) I will just keep to the History channel and A&E for my stuff like this.
I bought the DVD collection hoping it would help me in seeing historical events from a different perspective (everyone has their angle based on what country you read) but what I found was more hype than anything.  At the price I paid it was 5 DVDs for about $6 a piece but I still think I overpaid.
If you know nothing about the 20th century it might be worth it.
I would recommend a book entitled ""What Everyone should Know about the 20th Century"" or Isaac Asimov's ""History of the World"" or his other book ""History of Science and Inventions"" for those seeking historical information on key historical dates in politics & technology/invention.  As a matter of fact, I HIGHLY recommend the first book as I found it to be ALOT of reading but Tremendously informative and worth the time spent reading it.",1017014400,3,1318,4.572033898305085

For a quick run through of the century, I would suggest another survey.  This one groups things in strange ways, and is too quick for it to be worth while.  Sorry Walter, this just is not as good as it could have been.",1010707200,3,377,4.208333333333333
