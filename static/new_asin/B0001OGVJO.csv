Here's about the DVDs:
 First the Cover: What's great about each of the DVDs including the OVAs is that you can flip the cover because it is Double-Sided. One side has the ""Yoroiden Samurai Trooper"" and the other ""Ronin Warriors"". So depending on your preferance of the Japanese or English Version you can have it on either side.
 The DVD Case itself contains: The Disc which is double-sided [see below], an insert which is double-sided [see below].
 Disc: The disc is double-sided which is not often seen. One side contains the Japanese Version and the other the English Version.
 Insert: The insert is also double-sided. Each side has a character on it. Starting at DVD 1 is Ryo [the leader] and then DVD 10 is Talpa [the baddie]. It's whoever is one the side of the DVD is who is on the page. Then each side has the Japanese and English Versions of the Episodes.
 This is also true for the cover. It has the summary in a different way and the episodes as well.

Each DVD Contains 4 episodes minus the last one which has only 3 episodes as there are only 39 in Total.
There are a total of 10 DVDs together and then there are two more DVDs: this has the OVAs on it. The first Extra has ""Gaiden"" and ""Kikoutei Denesu"" [Legend of the Inferno Armor]. The second has ""Message"". So actually there are 12 DVDs in total.

It's a well worth set as the prices as I've seen are very cheap for the DVDs. I have all 12 DVDs in my collection. It took me a long whle to collect, but that was because I waited 'till they were in store.

I love the set as with what it comes and I love the Anime the most! This and Inuyasha are my two favorites! :D",1195084800,2,1867,4.251412429378531
