423854,4,6302069130,"Stars : Casper Van Dien,Lou Ferrigno and Snow White,Rapunzel,Cinderella,Sleeping Beauty  and Little Red Riding Hood.

Write & Directed by : Jeremy M. Inman

Must admit,Have wanted to see this flick since it was announced.

Not disappointed in the least,It has all The Mockbuster goodness,You would expect and more much more in exact dialogue That puts that tongue in that cheek and Even a Avengers Hawkeye nod in plot that Rocked !

Casper as an oddly named villian is mucho over-the-top and enjoys every moment of his scenery chewing.

Lou Ferrigno may have had that once in a career chance to shine, And he plays with gusto,Not seen in other Superheriocs by major studios.

OK,Dont think a major spoiler that this looks like a franchise and a welcome one at that.",1426204800,3,765,4.838461538461538
423855,4,6302069130,"The Return of Peter Grimm is a story about an elderly man whose wealth gives him more friends than he really needs. Peter (Lionel Barrymore), aside from being wealthy, has a need to control other people's lives. His adopted daughter has come of age, and even though she is in love with another man, he forces her to become engaged to his nephew. His family also extends to a little boy with whom Peter can become a little boy again and a doctor whose belief in the paranormal is nothing but foolishness to Peter. However, when he dies, Peter comes back a spirit to right the wrongs he has done to his loved ones and to apologize to his friend for not believing in spirits.

The movie unfolds gently and well; the characters are likable. It is basically all in one location since the story was originally a stage porduction written by David Belasco. It is very reminicient of Barrymore's later film On Borrowed Time, however, and that one was a better movie. That does not discredit this movie; it is highly enjoyable. Of course, it is strange to think that Barrymore could give such a good performance even though we cannot clearly see his face for much of the film, but this is simply a testament to his acting abilities.",1159833600,5,1222,4.529411764705882

424081,5,6302069130,"This movie was actually better than expected, despite the notoriously awful studio behind it. The Aslyum is a studio famous for making B-level movies and cheap knockoffs that blatantly copy summer blockbusters. But thus movie is actually good for what it is! These 1-star reviews are pretty unfair! Don't judge a movie by the studio behind it or the budget.

The story is about mythical fairy tale princesses being Avengers-like superheroes and having to save Los Angeles from their enemy. Snow White is the queen of the fairy tale realm and the Captain America of the team and has ice-like superpowers like Elsa from Frozen. Rumpelstiltskin is the villain of the story and a powerful warlord who is trying to conquer the fairy tale realm. But when he learns of Earth, he chooses to invade Los Angeles instead and needs Snow White, whose husband and king he just killed, to get there. Snow White takes Rumpelstiltskin to Earth and leave the fairy tale warlands behind, but follows him there for several years, as well. That's when her allies and fellow princesses learn of what happened and use the magic mirror to find Snow White on Earth. Her allies and fellow princesses are Repunzel, who has a mace ball attached to her hair and uses it as a weapon, Cinderella who has hypnotic mind control magic over all men, (Sleeping) Beauty, who has purple hair and is the most experienced hand-to-hand fighter on the team, and the rogue who's not really part on their group but helps anyway, Red (Riding Hood), who is the Hawkeye/Black Widow of the group as an archer and not a team player.

When the other four get to Earth, they learn Rumpelstiltskin, who has even more powerful mind control hypnotic powers than Cinderella, has become mayor and abuses the police force as his personal slaves. Snow White has gone underground in Los Angeles and finds Cinderella, Repunzel, Beauty, and Red when they get to Earth. Red has the piece of the mirror that will allow them to go back gine, but also allow Rumpelstiltskin to bring his army to Earth, but all she cares about is hunting down Rumpelstiltskin's lieutenant and her arch nemesis, (The Big Bad) Wolf. So she runs off to hunt him down.

Meanwhile, Snow, Cinderella, Repunzel, and Beauty try to devise a plan to get past Rumpelstiltskin's criminal and police enforcers and raid City Hall to kill him. However, Red gets caught by Rumpelstiltskin after losing her fight with Wolf and becomes controlled by him, while also now giving him the gateway to bring his army from the fairy tale kingdom to Earth. So Snow White's team of fairy tale princess avengers enlist help from some of the humans closest to mayor Rumpelstiltskin, like a cop they rescue and his personal assistant Jessica, to sneak their way into City Hall. There's also a true-neutral character named Iron John (who plays a villain Hulk/Collossus hybrid) and Jack from various fairy tales, who also aid in taking down Rumpelstiltskin. Eventually, the Avengers Grimm princesses have to stop Rumpelstiltskin, his now-invading army, the unwilling enforcer Iron John, and the mind-controlled Red.

The acting is... Passable, here. No real complaints and everyone did an okay job. The music and sound is pretty good. No issues, here. The directing and cinematography is actually better than expected and its all very well done for a smaller-budget B movie. It all looks professional. The visual effects and CGI are... Passable. Not bad, but not incredible, either. Lastly, the premise of this movie is interesting. It could've easily been a cheap Avengers clone, but the writer and director seemed to have fun with the idea. The movie is an action/superhero movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. And the story itself is original and creative and actually doesn't stick to the Avengers premise too much. The idea of fairy tale princess superheroes works here, partly due to the actresses. It doesn't hurt that they're all really attractive, as well. But they aren't too bad of actors, either.

Ranking everything by grade, I'd say this:

Story & Script: B
Plot & Pacing: A
Acting: C+
Sound: A
Music: B+
Directing: B
Cinematography: A
VFX: C+

Overall, this movie was just entertaining for what it is. It's not just a cheap knockoff like so many other Asylum films. It has its own oringiality to it and the actresses all play heroic and fleshed-out characters. A minor gripe is that they never really say who any of Snow Whites allies are by name, so you have to kinda guess who they are. Repunzel is obvious by her long hair, as is the 18 year old archer version of Red Riding Hood (the only one to actually look like her fairy tale counterpart), and Cinderella is almost always blonde, so she can be guessed. But Sleeping Beauty is never mentioned by name, nor does she have purple hair or look like a female marine or mercenary. Only in the credits do you find out what princess she is supposed to be. Plus, she only uses magic once in the movie and her power is to put people to sleep or turn them into sleepwalking slaves by making them dream.

But the movie is a good effort for what could've been another cheap blockbuster ripoff of The Avengers and I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a true sequel of this with the fairy tale princess heroes. (There is a Suicide Squad sequel to this called ""Sinister Squad,"" but it's more of a spinoff than a sequel.)

If you like low-budget gems and to watch an original movie (even if one made by accident), check out Avengers Grimm. It's better than you'd expect. 7.5/10.",1478563200,,5525,4.758872651356993

The four actresses that play Snow White, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella although they are very pretty their acting skills in this particular movie is the worst I have ever seen from either of them.
Elizabeth Peterson as Red (Riding Hood) is the best female actress and is more believable. Lou Ferrigno plays Iron John and is just great. While two minor characters Jessica played my Justin Herron does a better job then the leader actress and the rookie officer did a stand up job.

425040,3,6302069130,"I rave about Asylum Studios movies all the time because I am a fan of outlandish storylines, impossible odds that the heroes have to overcome and the ability to make something good with a very low budget (and I mean VERY LOW BUDGET). They had to Frankenstein this movie. Meaning that they got movie props that were used in Xena Warrior Princess and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles just to make this movie! Out of all the movies that Asylum Studios released within their 2015 list of movies, this was one of the weaker ones. Now even I will have to admit that this movie has gone over the chintzy meter but hey, I have seen good/sub par/better quality special effects from Asylum Studios before. However, this movie doesn't have that hallmark moment that we all look for in an Asylum Studios movie. So to help you understand this movie, you'll have to look at it from a kid's point of view (somewhere from ages 8 to 10 years old). In other words, you'll have to use your ""Mr. Rogers Make Believe Skills"" and view it from a different perspective. Where this movie lacks in regards to a good storyline, it makes up for it with some good fight scenes because let's face it, a good action movie isn't good without any fight scenes in it whether it's good or bad. That an also filming the movie in downtown L.A. also helps too. Anyway, What do I think? I like it but this is going to be one of those movies in my collection that will be somewhere in the back shelf gathering dust until I bust it out on either a Sunday morning or on a rainy day but yes, I will watch it from time to time. So what is my verdict?

Storyline: C
Special Effects: C+
Acting: C
Language: Nothing colorful, you can watch this with the kids.

425080,4,6302069130,"Overall:  The movie has special effects, lighting, camera work, and audio quality on par with a good TV series (Buffy, Angel, Charmed, etc.).  The movie is fast-paced with a few slow points.  The movie does hold together as a combination of the Avengers (team movie), Guardians of the Galaxy (team movie, quest movie), and probably Maleficent (re-imagining of fairy tales) and Frozen (ice powers).  The movie is probably clean enough to be broadcast with no changes.

The Good:  Most of the characters are well-acted.  Casper Van Dien is almost over-the-top but is a convincing as the slightly off-center bad guy.  Lou Ferrigno delivers his lines as well as his hearing-impaired speech impediment allows, so his character sounds like he has a heavy accent.  Lauren Parkinson (Snow White) is intense, cold, and rigid as her character's name implies.

A lot of characters are crammed into one movie, and they seem to work, more or less.  Snow White is the cold, revenge-driven princess.  Red Riding Hood is the angry, revenge-driven non-princess.  Rumplestiltskin is the power-mad villain.  The Wolf is Red's adversary.  Motivations get a bit thin after that, but this is only a single movie and not a TV series.

The Bad: Cinderella is a generic princess.  All of the princesses except for Rapunzel look generic, and the transformation makeup on Lou Ferrigno is not good at all.  A few scenes dead-end or feel inconsistent, perhaps due to editing or script changes.",1436400000,3,1464,5.029166666666667

Magical princesses Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel and Cinderella team with Red Riding Hood to pass through the magic mirror to our world to pursue Rumpelstiltskin and The Wolf before they open the pathway and evil Rumpelstiltskin can bring through his army of Thralls to reek havoc in our world as he has in the World of Grimm.  It was so outrageous it was entertaining and amusing to watch.  Better than standard Asylum B films.  Casper Van Dien plays Rumpelstiltskin humorously tongue in cheek, he appears to be having fun with the role.  Elizabeth Peterson did a good job as Red Riding Hood.  A sci fi action movie that provides a interesting way to pass some escapism time if you don't take it too seriously.  Worth a fun watch.",1430179200,11,818,4.6
425116,3,6302069130,"When you combine Asylum with Casper Van Dien ( Rumpelstiltskin ) and Lou Ferrigno (Iron John) with a title that has convoluted Marvel comics with Grimm's fairy tales you really can't expect much.  Rumpelstiltskin is attacking the kingdoms of various princesses as he wants to take his army of thralls through the magic mirror into LA, a land the has no magic. Snow White (Lauren Parkinson) for reasons that are not exactly clear refuses. In a death grip match, both pass through the mirror.

Moments later in another struggle three other princesses (with magical powers also) and Red Riding Hood (Elizabeth Peterson) with the wolf (Kimo Leopoldo) pass through the mirror and smash it as they go. These moments translate into years later in LA (one of those Narnia things) where Rumpelstiltskin is a mean powerful mayor and BTW red has a mirror shard in her shoulder (doesn't effect her ability to fight) which is the only way back to the fairy tale kingdom.

The film at times tries to be a grindhouse and other times goes for camp. At no time is there any serious acting. Lauren Parkinson as Snow White was perhaps the worst of the lot, even surpassing Van Dien with her laughable delivery. Red attempts to make a go of it, but considering the cast, her efforts were clearly in vain.

Film might make the ""so bad its good"" list, but I didn't see it that entertainingly bad.

Now, if there is no such thing as so bad it's good, this film would have been inexcusable. Absurd plot, unconvincing acting, cringe-worthy dialogue.

425147,3,6302069130,"Wow.  This is like Jim C. Hines meets Roger Corman.  Lauren Parkinson is a particularly spicy number as Snow White, who has ice powers.  Milynn Sarley as Cinderella has some sort of illusionist thing going; Marah Fairclough as Sleeping Beauty gets her powers from her name; Rileah Vanderbilt as Rapunzel (a redhead) swings an iron weight knotted into the end of her braid.  Rounding out the crew is Elizabeth Peterson as Red (Riding Hood), wielding a mean bow and on a singular mission- to kill Rumpelstiltskin's henchman, The Wolf, played by Kimo Leopoldo.  Justine Herron as Jessica- Rumplestiltskins magically charmed floozy- is also lovely and kinda funny.

What's Good: Lots of eye candy, nods to the fairy tales (natch) and nostalgia.  The princesses strut around in fetish/stripper-riffic gear while invoking every cheesy and hokey trope the writer could wring out of the script.  Casper van Dien doesn't just chew the scenery, he practically shreds it with his teeth.  Good to see him enjoying a bit of a renaissance, especially with his role in the Mortal Kombat web series.  Lou Ferrigno also gets to ham it up as Iron John, and you can tell he's having fun with the part. You even get the standard showdown at the police station scene.

What's Bad: A lot of the dialogue is really cringe-worthy, especially with dramatic pauses in all the wrong places.  The magic doesn't make much sense, but was it really supposed to?  I don't expect much from Mockbusters like this one, but consistency is appreciated.

What's Left: Not much.  Some of the music was interesting so I'm sorta curious about it now.  And the ending is wide open for a sequel/franchise, so theres that.

In most of the movie the only people who truly were named were Red, Wolf, Snow White, and Rumplestilskin.  This made the others a little confusing at times, I was constantly trying to figure out who the other 3 princesses were until about half way thru the movie.

If you can get past all of that, this movie was good enough for a free movie.  Hell, I would even pony up a small box fee if needed to watch it. (thankfully I didn't have to as Amazon is amazing and let me see if free with prime.)

None of them really had a character arc, except for Iron John. Red Riding Hood kind of had one? But it didn't feel realistic to me.

Cinderella was my favorite (powers were cool, actress was not too bad, character was somewhat relatable). However, I had a really hard time caring about Snow White, who was supposed to be the queen and the leader. She was one-dimensional. I get that they were trying to show that she was driven by revenge, but it did not come across that way. She was quite unfeeling and I disliked the way she treated the other princesses. There are other ways to show someone filled with vengeance besides constantly berating her supposed teammates. That was the most frustrating aspect of her character.

Overall, it is an okay movie, especially since it is free on Prime. Cheesy, but interesting concept. I finished it mostly because I wanted to know what happened, not because I needed to know.",1505520000,,1131,4.794871794871795
