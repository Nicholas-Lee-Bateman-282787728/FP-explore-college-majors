4905709,5,B005YFGIWK,Road Trip!  who would have thought that being stuck in Vork's van could be so entertaining.  Wonderful cameos from has beens and almost were's.,1325462400,,143,4.916666666666667
4905710,4,B005YFGIWK,"I don't know if the cast only had the locations for a short time or if they had other time concerns, but the normally rapid-fire dialogue of ""The Guild"" seems to turn into almost inaudible auctionspeak in the first few season five episodes. I was worried that the cast had lost interest and was just ""phoning it in,"" but I'm glad to say that my paranoia was not justified. Once the major plotlines are established the rhythm is found, the show seems to blast off. Maybe the reason for the hyperactive pace is that Season 5 is positively *crammed* full of cameo appearances. Some of these you may expect and some you will definitely not. It almost seems like spoilers to list them all, so I'll avoid that in case you wait for the DVD releases to watch the whole season for some reason. All of your favorite (main) characters are present and accounted for, but this season they mostly operate on their own. This is another aspect of season five that is off-putting at first, but Felicia Day proves once again that she can write ""geeks with hearts of gold"" and manages to bring the Guild together for a stunning finale.

Most of the drama of this season (and a lot of the laughs) comes for the ever-developing relationship between Codex (Day) and Tink (Amy Okuda). These two are a blast to watch as a pair. Tink is her usual acerbic self, but finds herself sharing secrets with Codex, only to have Codex light the road to relationship hell with her good intentions. The plot with Codex and The Game's designer is less interesting, besides serving to move the drama forward later in the arc. However, as a writer Day tends to be generous with ""the good stuff"" and uses Codex mostly as a rallying point anyway, so this is a non-issue.

Vork (Jeff Lewis) teams up with Bladezz (Vincent Caso) in what can only be described as a scam to make money off of Bladezz's sublimely ridiculous internet commercial from Season Four. I like Caso's character because he never seems to learn his lesson. Any time he admits fault is largely by accident, and yet he remains extremely likeable (many fans protested the virtually unknown Caso being fake-ousted from the Guild in Season One). Not much can be said about Jeff Lewis that hasn't already been said. He's just an incredibly funny guy. It must have been really hard to not put Lewis and Parikh together again this season, and I understand the decision to cut back on that pairing, but I don't like it. I'm a greedy fan and I want more.

Clara (Robin Thorsen) gets a solo plot involving a Steam Punk cosplay troop. For what seems like a pretty minor subplot, it pays off in a big way. Clara is definitely something special and I kind of wish she had a another chance to play off the others like she did with Okuda in Season Four. Her childlike sense of fun and self-centered cavorting do clash very well against the cold and haughty cosplayers, though. I'm not sure if this was intended, but Clara has that brilliant ""Homer Simpson"" appeal. She's a lousy parent, she's not smart, but she finds so much joy in things it's impossible not to like her.

If I had to pick a lamentable subplot it would be Zaboo's (Sandeep Parikh) ""seat-savers"" arc. It served as a framework to bring in some incredible cameos, and Parikh played Zaboo's Kurtzian insanity *perfectly*, but I really missed the good-natured Zaboo of earlier seasons. Is the arc hilarious? Yes. But I really wanted to see Zaboo grow as a person and come to the conclusions he makes through introspection and development as a grown man instead of rushed lack of interest brought on by ultra-fandom. Day always gets the characters where they need to be, but in this case it feels sort of like a shortcut. I will say it was amazing to see Parikh steal scene after scene no matter who was placed in front of him.

Overall this is another great season of ""The Guild."" If I seem to be too hard on this little webseries it's because I don't regard it any lower than the scripted network shows with millions of dollars in their budget. Felicia Day and company are simply excellent at what they do and deserve praise as well as honest criticism. This season sort of feels like the end of ""The Guild,"" but let's hope that I'm wrong and there's more to come from these talented people.

***EDIT: I'm not being a doomsayer, it just seems like the end of this season could be considered the ""Series Finale"" because of where it puts the characters (especially Codex). I'd personally love to see plenty more stories with these characters.",1324771200,2,4515,4.567901234567901

4905712,5,B005YFGIWK,"The Guild series just keep getting better and better.  Even if you're not a geek, or haven't played multiplayer online games (MMORPGs), the wit, humor, and sarcasm of this series will leave you laughing LOL.  If you are-- or know-- any of the above, it's even better.  Felicia Day and her gang of misfit gamer buddies take the show on the road and raid a gaming convention.  Heady pokes at the gaming industry, gamers, and geek conventions (ComicCon, DragonCon, MegaCon etc) abound.  Sprinkle that with the usual social ineptness and pseudosexual tensions and neuroses of the Knights of Good, and you've got a verry enjoyable-- and HI-Larious-- romp through modern gamer culture.  The guest star cameos really show what kind of support an indie webshow filmmaker with the brilliance of Felicia Day deserves-- even if you're not a Nathan Fillion fan (and who isn't).  And as we say in the South, the cast are just precious... These are released on internet a la Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog (also a must see with Felicia Day) and are initially funded through internet viewing hits on the two (three if you count a gaming console) websites that host them, but then at long last are released on DVD so you can view them when the internet is down-- or if you don't have internet, like in our neck of the woods where the chicken houses will get internet before we do.

4905734,4,B005YFGIWK,"First, let's start off with the need to have watched the previous seasons to get many of the jokes in this season.  I like to think it would be obvious, but a series should be watched in order - and this one has too many running jokes to be able to pick up without the prior seasons.

If you liked the previous seasons, you'll like this one.  The type of humor is the same, but for the first time the guild goes on a road trip.  It's possibly the first time any of them have individually gone on a road trip, let alone as a guild.  You get to know more about the lives of characters, particularly Tink.

As far as the packaging, extras, etc., they're on par with previous seasons.  It's a solid purchase at a decent price.",1359763200,,722,4.151079136690647
4905735,5,B005YFGIWK,Definitely the best season yet; The Guild is such a unique and hilarious show and I can't believe they pulled off all they did this season.  Best cast and crew ever.,1358985600,,165,4.32258064516129

The Guild season 5 may not be suited to everyone's tastes, but I thought it was phenomenal. I bought it twice, for crying out loud. I consider the second purchase an endorsement for season six. The Guild has been great and different in each season. I hope it continues for a long time to come.",1334102400,,530,4.463917525773196

I own Seasons 1-4 on DVD, and up to that point, I love the show, but after seeing Season five, I will simply
pretend the show ended with them all going to a Con and off into the wild blue gaming sunset.
Season 5 really jumped the shark only here they used a remote control steampunk airship the gang built instead.
The result had the same effect.
TOTAL LAMENESS(.)
Even if someone could explain to me just HOW such a thing could fly...never mind, I'm done.
THE GUILD was (and still is) a favorite of mine...ending at Season 4.

The DVD quality is pretty poor - the last few seconds of every episode is cut off which is a little frustrating. Still, it's worth watching and enjoyable - the characters are up to their old hijinks and much entertainment is to be had.  The A-list-geek cameos are amazing and are really a highlight of the season.",1331856000,2,392,4.283783783783784
4905750,1,B005YFGIWK,"I purchased The Guild Season 5 back in January (2012). Now they release it with new packaging? What else did they change? Is this Day and co. double-dipping, or Amazon trying to pull a fast one. I looked up the disc I purchased three months ago to find very little information remaining here with the note that they didn't know when to expect (that version) to be back in stock.

(Just went and checked) The version I purchased (for the same price) has all of the special features and looks to be one of Amazon's ""burn on demand"" discs. Still, I wonder, aside from a new cover, what else this second (and I might presume ""official""?) release has that mine doesn't. I've purchased every season of The Guild as it has become available, despite already seeing it when originally ""aired."" Do I have to start approaching these disc releases with more caution in the future?

Otherwise, great season, okay special features, etc, presuming it is *exactly* like the disc I bought in January (though I kinda like the cover on the ""new"" release). If you haven't purchased it already, here's your chance.",1331596800,,1093,4.6875
4905751,4,B005YFGIWK,"What's the difference between this release and the one that's already out? The one that came out in December is bleeped and the ad for this one says ""unrated"", so maybe that's it. Also the current one's sound is out of sync on one ep, so i guess i'll be buying this all over again.  :(

If you haven't bought S5 already, i'd suggest waiting for this one. Great show, just would have preferred only to have had to buy it once.",1329782400,10,425,4.170731707317073

4905753,4,B005YFGIWK,"While season five wasn't bad, it wasn't on par with previous seasons. The actors seem hyper kinetic in getting out the next gag. Their lines are sometimes forced and a lot of chemistry between the characters has been lost.

One memorable moment is the balloon scene. Clara was stalwart in her composure as the ship went down.

If you are a guild fanatic and I am one you will need to purchase the DVD. Just dial back you credulity and realize that all shows eventually get stale and worn. This crew is just more lovable on the down turn.",1329264000,,537,4.414141414141414

4905756,2,B005YFGIWK,"I love The Guild, however I absolutely hate this DVD.  This manufacture on demand DVD-R is horrid.  Between my 2 computers, PS3, and 3D Bluray player I have 6 ways to to play this DVD and each reproduces the same problems.  When each episode starts the audio takes a few seconds to start so parts of dialog are missing and when the episodes end it cuts off a few seconds.  Example of this is the end of episode 5 when Tink and Codex kiss, Bladez turns around sees them and does a spit take.  The whole spit take is cut off.  This is a major unacceptable flaw to me.  I'll be exchanging this DVD in the hopes I just got a bad copy.

The replacement DVD-R plays a lot better then the first one, but still has a couple glitches with it.  I'm shipping back the replacement and waiting for a normal production run DVD.",1328400000,5,813,4.193548387096774
4905757,3,B005YFGIWK,"I don't normally do reviews on Amazon, but I feel like I have to at least be honest with this item. I love The Guild. It's one of my favorite web shows, and it's something I could watch over and over again without getting tired of it. That being said, this is easily the weakest ""season"" of the series so far.

It may be because they aren't playing ""The Game,"" or it may just be a little too far out in left field for me, but I didn't find myself enjoying this season as much. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments. But there were times when jokes seemed a little too cliche, or there were cameos of people who I had no idea who they were...yet they were treated like people who I should immediately recognize.

I would recommend that people watch this one online first before buying it. It's not a waste of money or anything, but you may want to try to get it at a discounted price, if possible. Or buy it anyway to support the show.",1328140800,,935,4.131868131868132
