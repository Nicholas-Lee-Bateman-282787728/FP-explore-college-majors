I started doing this yoga and the very day after I started I could feel my back pain improve dramatically and the stiffness almost gone, the improvements lasted for about 2 days but after using this on a more regular basis I am now almost completely pain free, I can even touch my ankles! It single handedly improved the quality of my life !",1397347200,,544,4.240384615384615

Used it in my hotel room  and I felt a relief immediately after the first 15 min
Goes beyond the exercise ; also discuss and shows how to use the pressure points etc
Recommend it !",1344297600,2,222,3.933333333333333
