4703240,5,B005HS00V4,This is an excellent item for every Peter fan.  I ordered mine thru his website and received it in mid October (the time it was released overseas).  It has fantastic photos along with the blu ray and standard definition DVD's of the concert.  There is also a studio CD and live CD of New Blood.  My only concern is that the 'Frequently Purchased Together' items are found all in this selection.  Doesn't seem to spend almost $30 more for individual items when you can save some money and get it in this Deluxe Import.  Any fan cannot go wrong with this purchase.,1319932800,9,562,4.46078431372549
4703241,1,B005HS00V4,"Freaking BORING!!! What has happened to Peter Gabriel? I guess the good old days of ""So"" are over. Regret making this purchase. Who knows, maybe I'll enjoy it one day... When I'm INSANE!!!!",1319760000,4,189,4.757575757575758
4703242,5,B005HS00V4,"I just received my blu ray copy and watched the concert.  It is simply amazing!  First of all, the video and audio quality is the best it can get.  I don't care for 3D so I have the normal version.  All the songs have been re-worked for orchestra and they are mind blowing.  If I had to single out songs, I would say Biko, Rhythm of the Heat, and Single to Noise will blow you away. Just to sum up, Peter is a man in full control of what he does, this is an amazing concert and concept.  It is not just a rock concert with orchestra, it uses the orchestra as the main elements.  You need to experience it for yourself. Very highly recommended.",1319673600,23,643,4.096
4703243,5,B005HS00V4,"Wow.

I mean, WOW.

Just got done watching this on a Sony XBR-HX929 46"" 3D TV -- 2 hours of pure Peter Gabriel goodness... in 3D. I would have a hard time believing that being AT the concert would be better than seeing it like this, with all of the different 3D camera angles and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound. The selection of songs includes everything from Peter's ""New Blood"" CD, and then some. The picture is amazingly sharp and the 3D cinematography is top-notch -- so much so that if I want to demo 3D to someone, I'll use this instead of ""TRON Legacy"" from now on. Peter is a consummate showman and it's clear that he puts a lot of effort into making his concerts unforgettable experiences.

Other musicians need to watch this video and try to keep up. THIS is how you do a music concert on disc.",1319587200,26,816,4.3202614379084965
4703244,5,B005HS00V4,"Watch this on a 60"" Samsung 3D plasma television and it was amazing.  It appears all the camera work was done with 3D in mind and with HD cameras.  It really makes you feel like this is better then going to the concert and it was for me.
I hope other artists give Peter Gabriel a call and inquire how they casn do this on their next concert tour, as well.  I will be buying more 3D concerts in the future for sure.",1319587200,10,414,3.963855421686747
4703245,3,B005HS00V4,"I haven't seen or heard this DVD yet, but I did see Peter's show this past summer with the New Blood Orchestra, and I can tell you first hand - amazing! I was floored! This wasn't your average sappy sweet slow string accompaniment - this orchestra WAS the show.

  This is orchestration on steroids! Think Beethoven mixed with Copeland mixed with Shostakovich, and then turn the volume up to 12. They are totally engaged with every aspect of the music, and the arrangements are absolutely first rate (can't recall the arranger's name).

  Peter's performance is relegated to more of a vocal accompaniment, as opposed to the center of attention, and he seems to relish his new found role while standing aside and letting this bombastic and talented orchestra give new life to his old standards.

  If you are one of those people who've always thought an orchestra could never whip up the power and fury of a live rock band, you need to see this. Prepare to pick your jaw up from the floor. Oh, and as if that weren't enough, the visuals are stunning also.

  I distinctly remember saying to my wife and friends as we were leaving the show that night ""Man, I really hope he puts this concert to DVD"". Well thank you Peter for making that wish come true. I'm putting this pre-order in right now for the DVD. I will review and report back later.

FOLLOW UP**********

  Well, I did finally obtain my copy of this DVD. Being a long time, die hard fan of Peter, it pains me to say it, but I have to pull at least one star from my initial rating. First of all, this is not quite the same set list I saw him perform live here in Philly. Most of his originals were the same, but sadly missing is ""Father and Son"" - a beautiful tribute song he wrote to his father, along with a few other good ones that were on his set list the night I saw them. The cover songs are almost all different, and I must contend that the cover set that I saw them perform was much more interesting.

  Also, and I'm not sure if this show was done early on in the tour (I would assume it was, being in London) but the performance just doesn't seem to flow like the show I saw. Peter's voice is strong and clear, but he seems a bit ""disconnected"" with the orchestra. And the orchestra itself seems weak and unrehearsed. At some points this almost 100 piece orchestra seems to sound more like an apprehensive, nervous string quartet! And to make matters worse, I feel they were mixed way to far in the background. The live performance I saw the orchestra was EXCITING and engaged - they were on their feet and their sound was powerful and in your face. The entire venue was shaking.

  So all in all, I'm not sure if it's a performance issue, a sound mixing issue, the choice of songs, or all of the above, but compared to the live show I saw, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this disc. It's probably a nice addition to have for die hard Peter fans just to see and hear how his music transposes into a more classical/orchestrated genre. But don't expect the chills down your spine like the ones experienced at the live performance.",1317772800,12,3099,4.390542907180385
4703246,5,B005HS00V4,"Get a big screen TV, turn up the volume, push play. The next thing you know it will be over. The orchestral arrangements are so compelling and powerful that you can do little other than submit to them and not notice time passing by. I've seen the live concert a couple of times. In the theater I heard textural details in the mix that I didn't notice live, despite the live sound being great too. Details that, as a composer, blew me away. If you have a good sound system, and let yourself just be drawn in, you won't miss the drums and theater of previous tours. The visual effects are first rate anyway - no gimmicks required. The sound in the theater was as first rate as movie theater sound gets, so I would expect nothing less on a good home theater system.

The 3D in the theater was very effective.

In addition to PG fans, this is a MUST BUY for anyone into orchestral music or who wants an introduction to creative orchestral textures!",1315785600,54,944,4.357954545454546
4703247,3,B005HS00V4,"Saw this in 3D as a special event at a theater. 3D was well done and flat DVD or Blu-ray will not have that. Secret World is one of my favorite DVDs so perhaps my expectations / hopes were unrealistically high. But this is Peter and an orchestra (New Blood), not an orchestra backed rock band. Peter practically speaks the lyrics to the early songs. Did not have the theatrics that Secret World had, OK but I was hoping for stellar.",1315267200,17,432,4.345679012345679

I was unsure of how I would enjoy PG's music played by an orchestra (""no drums, no guitars""), but I think it is phenomenal!  A PG newbie might better start with the ""Secret World"" dvd (Blu-Ray version...  still my favorite!).

  I do NOT have a home 3D system, so while I own this combo pack, I have NOT tried the 3D disc, only the Blu-Ray; it's audio & video is perfect (to my old ears & eyes).

  The show itself is great!  While PG is getting on in years, his passion still shines through.  He may not move as quickly as he did when I first saw him in 1987, but his heart and vocal chords are front & present!  This is a first class music dvd.",1410480000,,794,4.144736842105263

4703263,5,B005HS00V4,"I have enjoyed Peter Gabriel since his early days with Genesis. He has proven to be an exceptional talent and a lot of his music has been used for movie soundtracks. I was privileged to see him in concert in Houston, Texas 30 years ago and enjoyed his live performance. This dvd/cd is awesome. His voice is strong and resilient the arrangements of the orchestra are incredible. San Jacinto is one of my favorites of Mr. Gabriel and he does an incredible performance. The live show on dvd is a masterpiece. This is a ""must"" for any die-hard Peter Gabriel fan.",1409961600,,558,4.534653465346534

It may not replace being there live but allows me to enjoy the show.  The ""New Blood"" concept was interesting but I enjoy the new production of the songs.

Don't get me wrong the music here is well recorded, but I missed the band experience.  After watching New Blood, I actually had to watch Secret World Live to get the ""bad taste"" out of my mouth.  Maybe that's harsh, but there is more to a Peter Gabriel experience than just Peter Gabriel & an orchestra & some other singers.  I wanted HIS WHOLE BAND!  If you liked Secret World Live, you may want to preview this DVD before buying it.  I wish I did.  I'll probably not want to watch New Blood more than once, while I've enjoyed Secret World Live many times in the past & look forward to watching it many times again in the future.",1390003200,,779,4.222972972972973

4703277,5,B005HS00V4,I have been a Peter Gabriel fan for years and was not sure if I would like the orchestration. It was stunning. I watched it through twice in 3d before I could turn my system off. The dynamics of the orchestra through my system was exhilarating. Hang on because it is a ride. It was something unexpected for me and I really enjoyed it.,1376870400,,334,4.234375

4703279,5,B005HS00V4,"Just a brilliant set of reworkings of his songs. It's, as he puts it, a lot of ""miserable white man tunes,"" but if you're a fan of Gabriel already that shouldn't be a problem. The older the fan, the better probably; not much Steam or Big Shot type stuff here (although the arrangement on Digging in the Dirt is great). Highlights for me were San Jacinto, Lou Reed's Power of the Heart, Paul Simon's Boy in the Bubble, and Rhythm of the Heat. The 3D is pretty cool but nonessential.",1375401600,,481,4.355555555555555

Some of Peter Gabriels' coolest songs done without rock and roll instruments like electric guitar and bass guitar if you can imagine that.  As always a cool show with him on vocals backed up by the New Blood orchestra.  It comes across magically, with lots of dynamics and intensity, and stage show presence.  What can you say? It is Peter at his finest always.",1372204800,2,487,4.511363636363637
4703281,5,B005HS00V4,The sign of great songs are they are timeless and can be interrupted many different ways.  This disk supports that.  Each song played with an orchestra and minimum backing vocals really showcase the songs themselves.  A must for any Peter Gabriel fan or one who follows this wide and varying career.,1371945600,,299,4.823529411764706
4703282,3,B005HS00V4,"This BluRay has some truly powerful moments to it. The Book of Love and Biko stand out among them! The conclusion to Biko alone is worth the watch.  There are other powerful arrangements and performances by the orchestra and Peter throughout. Intruder sets a good pace and I can't say it disappoints musically from there on, but both the Female vocalists and the the 3D video edits are disappointing. The video itself is often choppy and distracting -- overreaching with it's attempts to portray emotion and story.  A simpler portrayal of the musicians in action would create a far greater connection. I found that either putting the Video to Black and White are turning off the TV all together and just listening it through the DTS-Master Audio was a better substitute for the distracting lack of identity from the video. The female vocalists, while not poor by any means, often feel forced and nervous. The Book of Love has a nice female counterpoint, but I find it hard to think of another song that I felt any real connection to the female vocals.

And I agree with many who've criticized the pacing of the overall show. Each song standalone is far more enjoyable than trying to sit through the setlist as a whole. It's water under the bridge now, but the orchestra alongside of a more typical band could have assisted with this pacing issue. See Elbow's Seldom Seen Kid Live at Abbey Road for an example of how this is done right.

In short, good...but could have been so much better.",1368835200,,1489,4.67175572519084

It is different in that it is with a full orchestral backup, rather than a conventional band.  He definitely is still the star of the show, and the music is excellent, if a little bit different.

I actually bought it, watched a few cuts on YouTube, then felt a little disappointed.  I gave it to my wife on Christmas and we watched it and after watching the entire concert I thought ""actually that was a lot better than I thought It would be after

A driving rhythm section is clearly needed for many of his songs as we remember them and I'm not sure they do very well re-imagined without them. I greatly respect Peter's artistry and compositions and I'm sure he wanted to do something different after so many years. However, I think if he had maintained the rhythm sections (and bass) with the orchestra, this would have been far more effective - to me.",1350604800,8,600,4.669811320754717

What struck me to write now (while watching AGAIN) is how enthralling it is! This has to be watched without jumping around or distraction to really appreciate the subtle interplay between live action and post production done so perfectly that even the astute eye could miss it. Gabriel even knows this and thanks the production people. This isn't a review about them/that but rather my attempt to rectify the synergy in how every beat, emotion, graphic and interlude is just done RIGHT.

4703301,2,B005HS00V4,"I love Peter Gabriel's music, particularly when he wraps his sometimes rather pretentious lyrics around driving, complex African rhythms.  Take away the drums and what's left?  Pretentious lyrics with a bland background.  Sort of like Chinese food without the MSG, there does not seem to be much point.  Now, I really like classical music but Shock the Monkey is no concerto either, so it lacks the complexity of that genre, and unlike the late Freddy Mercury, Peter Gabriel cannot do opera.

If you like Gabriel's songs then I do not understand why you would have a problem with this project. What other artist combines artistic integrity, musical ability & avant garde spirit as well? Who even tries or would have the bonafides?? PG manages to bridge complex ideas & music with enough ""accessibility"" to be viable in today's music business. ""Money grab""? To put this together was no cheap endeavor. It is A+ quality in sound, video, & presentation (like everything he has every done). I too was a bit underwhelmed at the ""sparseness"" when I first heard one of these shows. Mistakenly thinking, his music is better in it's original form. I do enjoy the originals better I must admit but if you like PG in his ""purist"" form: voice, HEART, SOUL, song, message, I don't see how you could dismiss this. I ask anyone unhappy with this release - how would they have done it better? You either like the songs & their intrinsic quality and message or you don't.

The video for Secret World, always felt  over-produced(to me) and did not capture the scope of the whole stage. New Blood, sounds amazing, great takes on classic Gabriel songs. That being said, I don't know if Pete is to blame or the director, but it is filled with gimmicky shots, silly close-ups, and very little pulled back shots showing the whole stage and orchestra. There was also a great digital backdrop(saw it used better by nine inch nails) but still very cool....if they would pull back and show it to you. Note to artists, set a camera center stage, half_way back, and just film. Make it an option for those of us who don't like the gimmicks, but appreciate the theatrics, and less is more approach. I give the audio 5 out of 5. Film, 2 out of 5. Just buy it, put it in, and light some candles, and turn the TV off!!!

This Bluray was a great way to relive that experience and with better sound quality. I still long for some of the songs that were left back from the concert I attended (Hero from Bowie and Gabriel's own Secret World) but that is only a sign that this was so good we keep longing for more. I agree with the review I saw on the newspaper after the concert: this is not the first and certainly will not be the last collaboration of a rock artist with a classic orchestra but it will be difficult we will see such a classy, professional, and full of purpose example. It is not a cover's album but a real reinterpretation of songs where Gabriel really looked for a coherent work and included not only classics but basically songs that made sense with this approach.

4703310,4,B005HS00V4,"I'm really not sure what you ""die hard"" Peter Gabriel fans are complaining about?!? As an artist matures and changes things up a bit people always want to compare them to their previous work along with it's original delivery. I mean bands age, new members come and go, and instrumentation changes over the years. So with all that being said who bought this disc thinking you were going to be seeing one of Peter Gabriel's older shows would be disappointed. Is the tempo slower then his other concerts with the same songs, sure, however this time his arrangement is with a full piece orchestra. Many bands and artist have tried this and have fallen flat just because the music arrangement didn't match the artists original songs and just sounds weird. In my opinion many of Peter Gabriel's songs play well with this instrumentation changed. It's Peter's voice that seals the deal. As he has aged he still sound's great. The visual aspect of this piece was a little ""Circ De Soleilish"" but that's to be expected. Peter's shows have always been a little more about the presentation then just an artist on stage with his band. I enjoyed this disc and will play it over and over I'm sure. It's sonically well done and the visuals (non 3d) on bluray are well put together. It's on my list of demo material for a good audio/visual home experience. If you like Peter Gabriel and have followed his work you deserve to give yourself a look at this collection.

There is no energy, it's like Pete is reading a eulogy rather than singing in a concert. The female accompaniment was likewise poor. For me this was a huge waste of money, I will probably never put this disc in my player again.

I'm truly amazed that some people have given this title a good review, different strokes I guess.

4703314,4,B005HS00V4,"""New Blood - Live in London"" captures Peter Gabriel's most recent experiment in a career distinguished for experimentation.  Built on the ""Scratch my Back"" concept where he covered other artists' songs with an orchestral backing, this show will enthrall staunch Gabriel fans.

The setlist begins with a heavy dose of the ""Scratch my Back"" covers resulting in mixed results.  Regina Spektor's ""Apres Moi"" and a playful take on The Magnetic Fields' ""The Book of Love"" are strong tracks, but overall, this section of the show feels like a so-so opening act.  You can tell the audience at the Hammersmith had been ready to pounce on the Gabriel material once those tracks start up in earnest.

The often-minimalized orchestral treatment definitely leads to a much more down-tempo vibe for these familiar tracks.  This gives new emotional dimension and power to songs such as ""Signal to Noise"", ""Mercy Street"" and ""Red Rain"".  However, as the setlist progresses, monotony threatens to set in.  You'll breathe a bit easier when the jubilant take on ""Solsbury Hill"" comes up (and even the players seem to feel the same).

The video (yes, 1080i video) quality is crisp in this blu-ray release.  Cinematography was up and down - there were several tracks where I wished that the director had matched the less-is-more theme of the performance itself.  This was most evident in the opener ""Intruder"" where hyper-quick cuts from security monitors were a corny distraction.  Fortunately, the rest of the presentation is more reserved.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix is well done - clear and distinct as a performance such as this should be.

Overall, the ""New Blood - Live in London"" blu-ray is a great chronicle easily recommended for Gabriel's career fans.",1325030400,2,1747,5.041811846689895
4703315,5,B005HS00V4,"Peter Gabriel: New Blood-Live in London 3D Blu Ray is one of the best 3D discs I have purchased.  Peter Gabriel has made this concert to be watched in three dimensions and the concert, the 3D effects, and the music are excellent. Paul Simon once wrote ""These are the days of miracles and wonder"" this Blu Ray will confirm his declaration.  They used numerous 3D cameras to record this disc and you actually feel that you are there and you will see infinite varieties of depth in the orchestra and the audience.  The special effects are there too so you will have stuff popping out of the screen as well as feeling as if the performers were in your living room.  Peter Gabriel has aged but his skills as a performer have not diminished although he looks like a fat old guy. That is a bit disconcerting if you have been a fan since the days of his historic rock group Genesis.  The ""New Blood"" of the title refers to The New Blood Orchestra which admirably accompanies him. This concert was recorded in London in March 2011.  There are many songs on the disc and the only fault I could find is that I wasn't familiar with the new material from his album ""Scratch My Back"".  There is plenty of his older music too and the new stuff is great I just was not familiar with it.  You do not need liner notes to know what the lyrics are.  Peter Gabriel and his backup singers enunciate so the words are clear as a bell.  If you are a fan of Peter Gabriel you should purchase this disc in 3D.  It is 3D for adults and not just another animated piece of 3D schlock. Watch it on a large 3D screen if you can.  If you are going to buy a new TV buy the largest you can afford.  Whatever brand of television, whether 3D or not, nobody was ever sorry that they didn't buy a smaller TV.",1323475200,2,1769,4.213649851632048

Peter physically does not look well. If you were making a best of video,very little of this would be on it.",1322784000,7,476,4.118279569892473
4703318,5,B005HS00V4,"Several weeks ago I purchased Gabriel's dual disc which I gave a 5.0 rating (Oct. 29, 2011).  Buying this concert version of the music was a no brainer especially in Blu ray with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment.  I wasn't disappointed.  The concert is long at 162 minutes so there is no cheat on that score.  That's more than double the time on the CD and adds about 7 songs.

Gabriel is no slouch on audio and video tricks and often adds some of his own sound effects to the songs.  He also plays around with one of those small cameras that hang from the ceiling.  This goes on too long and too often for my taste.  While in full voice Peter Gabriel is still a strong vibrant singer but in the brief interludes between songs he talks in a near whisper even while the audience is still clapping.  This makes some of the introductions incomprehensible.

I can't speak highly enough of the fine ""New Blood"" orchestra assembled for this project.  Led by young conductor Ben Foster, they are brilliant.  There are no guitars and no drum kits, but there are 50 or so top notch musicians and are masterfully synched to play the great arrangements by John Metcalfe.  Gabriel has vocal backing by his daughter Melanie who has a few solos within the songs and Ane Brun whose voice sounds a bit frail on her one feature (""Don't Give Up"").  Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan shows up for one song (""In Your Eyes"") as well.

The direction that appears on the Blu ray is well done by Blue Leach.  The cameras are well located giving different angles of the singers and the conductor.  Still, it's all about the sound.  The surround versions put you about 15 rows deep in the center.  This is not the Peter Gabriel remembered from the 1980's.  He's more mature and like all artists wants to expand his musical horizons.  He does it here with a bit of new material, a few carefully selected covers and a new approach to his hits.  He doesn't miss.  An excellent concert well worth the money.

UPON FURTHER REVIEW:  This was a brilliant stepping stone for Gabriel who seems to satisfy everyone including himself by reinventing the great songs that everyone loves.  Make no mistake, while some of his newer stuff is terrific, the biggies come late in the show (2  hours!) and bring the house down.  Sonically the concert is well presented.  (4-27-12)

I can't add much to the above other than to reinforce my appreciation for the technical side of the performance.  Perhaps my recent equipment upgrades help, but the audio is as good as any I've heard.  There are several double bass instruments and some bass drums, a French Horn and a quartet of trombones, so the subwoofers will shake.  Fine direction and an excellent orchestra more than make up for Gabriel's silliness with the hanging camera.  In one instance, he nearly decapitates the conductor.  (2-2-15)",1322438400,4,2846,4.624
4703319,2,B005HS00V4,"This is slow and sad, almost dirge like.  It does not show the mischievous qualities of the Secret Garden performance of the 1990s.

4703327,3,B005HS00V4,"Peter Gabriel's music with no drums, guitars, bass, this is what this Blu-Ray is. It's new arrangements of songs with orchestra and a couple of females vocalists. So those news versions are classical oriented and are definitively more relaxed than the original songs. There is also about four songs taken from others composers. Those songs didn't grab my attention as very interesting songs, as some late Gabriel's songs, like ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Don't Give Up"". My favorite songs are from my favorite cd, and it's ""The Rhythm Of The Heat"" and ""San Jacinto"".

The music is more of a background sound to let the beautiful voice of Peter shines. The picture quality is excellent as the DTS-HD sound.
