8752636,1,B01CDB1AAW,What is it going to take to make these people understand? A large group of people believing they are doing something right. Just because you have a following doesn't mean you're reasoning is sound. You are all wrong. You will understand.,1531008000,,237,4.804878048780488
8752637,4,B01CDB1AAW,"I'm not inordinately enthusiastic about this film, but it came in at a lean eighty minutes and was done with obvious serious intent with a story that, though predictable, wasn't trite. Add to that some decent production values and engaging actors, and you have a well above average gay - themed movie that is certainly worth anybody's time.",1522972800,,340,4.879310344827586
8752638,5,B01CDB1AAW,"Many Americans have a problem watching foreign films. You must be open to other ways of thinking and cultural differences. While this movie may not be a classic, I liked this coming of age film, including over coming class differences. Some reviews criticized the ending. I was fine with it. Each of the boys were in different places in finding their sexuality. It is really a 4 star film, but I gave 5 stars to compensate for the so-so reviews.",1521072000,,445,4.575

8752643,1,B01CDB1AAW,"THIS IS A FOREIGN FILM THAT HAD SUBTITLES IN THE TRAILER, BUT NOT IN THE MOVIE. THEREFORE, IT WAS UNWATCHABLE. I HAVE NO OTHER WAY OF BRINGING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF AMAZON ...RATING BARES NO REFLECTION ON THE MOVIE THAT I WANTED TO SEE...BUT DIDN'T GET TO SEE.",1461196800,,263,4.387755102040816

8752645,4,B01CDB1AAW,"White privileged boy has a crush on poor native boy. Good story with the backdrop of corruption and inequality in Ecuador. This has some drama and political reality common to many Latin American countries. There's some very nice landscapes as well. Overall this move is an above average gay coming out story not typical of what you see in most gay centered films. It's not for everyone but those that appreciate a perspective outside of western European or US gay culture will like it. I'm done watching the tired gay cinema that exists right now about nothing but sex, drugs and drag queens. The people in this film are real people with real life issues living ordinary lives. The Spanish is also very interesting to listen to because it's the dialect typical of the Andean countries including Peru Bolivia and Chile. For me it was worth the rental fee.",1460332800,9,854,4.738255033557047
