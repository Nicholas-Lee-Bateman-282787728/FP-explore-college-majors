8357348,5,B002935GEQ,"This lovely mix of international pas de deux begins with two 1970s beauties from National Ballet of Canada, Sleeping Beauty Act III with Veronica Tennant & guest artist Rudolf Nureyev, and Karen Kain & Frank Augustyn in Giselle Act II; both selections are also available in full ballet DVDs with the same magnificent soloists.  Then you have the Black Swan pas de deux from Swan Lake Act III, also from the '70s, with super-ballerina Maya Plisetskaya & Alexander Bogatirev of the Bolshoi, which includes the solo variations except (unfortunately) for the famous 32 fouettes.  Thereafter you have the famous partnership of Cynthia Gregory & Fernando Bujones of ABT in the lively 1988 Coppelia, and very rare footage of the ethereal Tanaquil LeClercq partnered by Jacques D'Amboise in NYC Ballet's 1955 Afternoon of a Faun (she who so sadly contracted polio in her late 20s, cutting short a blossoming career), which though old shadowy B&W footage, has so much lyrical beauty.  The balance of the pas de deux includes the mostly Bolshoi Russian dancers Ekaterina Maximova with husband Vladimir Vasiliev (Romeo & Juliet), Irina Kolpakova & Sergei Berezhnoi (Raymonda), and Nadezhda Pavlova & Vyacheslav Gordeev (Don Quixote).  A very pretty selection.",1365811200,10,1248,5.225
8357349,4,B002935GEQ,"This anthology has a couple of rare clips that make it worth having. We have Maya Plisetskaya in the Black Swan, Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev in an early version of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and, the real treasure, a very rare film of Tanaquil LeClercq and Jacques d'Amboise (New York City Ballet, 1955) in a TV version of Afternoon of a Faun.  These three clips make it worth the price.  Most of the others have been included in other ballet anthologies.",1320624000,5,481,4.647058823529412
