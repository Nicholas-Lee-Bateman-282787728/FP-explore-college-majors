8440549,4,B004T7O55Q,"Even though I have two boys they don't mind Angelina Ballerina at all, and there are so guys in it so it is not all girls!  ""Angelina Ballerina: Pop Star Girls"" is full of lots of dancing and singing.  What I like about Angelina is she does all sorts of dancing styles and not just ballet.  This DVD features a big show and everyone has to work together and work hard to make everything go as planned.  It is really a cute DVD that is bright and fun.  The songs are so upbeat and positive that it is hard for kids to sit still, even my boys were up and moving around!",1308700800,2,567,4.026785714285714
