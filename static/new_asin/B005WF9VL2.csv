4899323,1,B005WF9VL2,"... it distorts the VERY nature of a Nudist and Naturism movement!  The movement does NOT have anything about s*x!!!!  It's about what's natural and healthy - and indeed, it includes all the families.  If you read this - go on YouTube and make your own searches (especially about Cape D'Age in France).",1466726400,,302,4.660377358490566
4899324,1,B005WF9VL2,No joke - this movie is incoherent and makes no sense worst than worst! Horrible.,1436918400,,81,4.466666666666667
4899325,1,B005WF9VL2,"The video quality is poor; most smart phones produce better quality video. Some of the content was obviously lifted from the internet. The ""professional"" actors in the video are unskilled, and I found the attitude and tone of two of the narrators to be condescending and offensive. The video is allegedly a documentary and it does contain some information about the history of nudism in film, but if you want real/useful information about naturism and nudism you might get better results from a web search.

This video contains full frontal (explicit) nudity of men and women in non-sexual situations, however this is a poor quality video and I believe that regardless of the reason you purchase this video you will be disappointed. If you feel that you simply must see this movie, rent it.",1416700800,5,790,4.895522388059701
4899326,2,B005WF9VL2,"More of an undergraduate film school project than anything, it lacked the storyline and quality acting to be a feature film. And definitely lacked the research, insight, and objectivity to be a true documentary.  Just a film that was largely disappointing.",1390089600,2,256,5.2439024390243905
4899327,4,B005WF9VL2,"A well presented real life documentary covering the theme well. Just enough nudity, well presented to keep it all on a high level.",1376524800,,130,4.695652173913044
4899328,2,B005WF9VL2,"Saw it once, took quite an effort to reach the end.
To me it just does not make any sense at all.
Maybe, if I dare see it another time I will discern what it is about.
But I will wait until I do not have anything else to do. Otherwise, I feel it would be a waste of time.",1363737600,4,271,3.533333333333333

4899331,1,B005WF9VL2,"As nudists, we're always looking for media that portrays nudism for what it is, a healthy, relaxing, and natural way to live. This is NOT it!!! Naked in the 21st Century has nothing to do with nudism! It is just a wanna-be director's sad attempt at film making. Basically, the premise is that they are making a movie about nudists. The acting is poor and the storyline is well, non-exisitent. Some of the footage of this movie is also in another huge waste of money, American Nudist. Don't waste your money on this movie!!!!",1346630400,19,524,4.585106382978723
