7922486,5,B00004TH8H,"Art Hodes brings together an excellent jazz ensemble in this one, including George Brunies of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings and my good friend, Nappy Trottier, who played with Brunies' band in Chicago in the l950's.  George demonstrates why he is one of the most dynamic of the tailgaters, and Hodes selects some excellent tunes to showcase the Chicago style.  Trottier is an excellent trumpet player, and to the best of my knowledge, neither Brunies nor Trottier is available anywhere else on video, although both are available on CDs and LPs.  It's probably the best of Hodes' Jazz Alley specials.  Grandpa Spells, Dr. Robert Hackler",1127692800,,634,5.0095238095238095
