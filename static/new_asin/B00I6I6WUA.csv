8639589,5,B00I6I6WUA,"A happier version of other films like this. The romantic comedy is a nice story that doesn't need to have a tragedy .It didn't make a lot of sense for his girlfriend to leave .She said if he told her he was not the author, she would leave and he tried to tell her. Later she says the opposite of this. The rest of the movie was cute.",1520640000,,333,3.911764705882353
8639590,5,B00I6I6WUA,"This was the original film from which ""The Words"" with Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Irons was based.  Hollywood certainly ""borrowed"" the screenplay.  This German film is joy to watch, and anyone with an annoying person in their professional life that they can't get rid of will certainly be howling in amusement.",1520553600,,309,5.03921568627451

8639592,4,B00I6I6WUA,"This German indie romantic comedy pokes fun at celebrity authors. In German with easy to read subtitles. No spoilers here

I don't ever remember seeing this romantic comedy of errors  play in Philadelphia, where I live and came upon it, when I discovered the trailer.
I don't like spoilers and  if you are reading this, you obviously haven't seen the film  I won't spoil your discovery and enjoyment by telling you more than the minimum. This 2010 German produced film (with really easy to read English subtitles), is a Pinocchio- like story of a waiter who spies a girl he wants to meet and  because she loves to read books  he tells here one little white lie, saying he wrote a book (the title of which - ""Lila Lila"" is the title of the film ) . She takes it to a publisher (all this in the first 5 minutes of the fil) and from there on he is caught in his own web. What happens next, and whether he gets the girl, is something Ill leave you to discover.
The film is Not Rated but there are is no nudity or graphic violence.
 Thats really all you need to know. If like independent films with acting by actors youve never seen before I think youll like it. I did. It pokes fun at celebrity authors who do reading s to sell-out crowds.

The 105-minute film was made in 2010 but it has a new distributor (Film Movement) and is getting new distribution. The only ""bonus"" on the DVD is the theatrical trailer.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
