7982751,2,B00008G7UB,"was very disappointed in the style of the presenter, and teaching methods.  Went very fast through each song, and expected you to keep up.  I realize you can stop the dvd, but was still very fast.  I will probably not buy another dvd with this person as the instructor.",1340064000,,269,4.448979591836735
7982752,5,B00008G7UB,"Excellent and easy learning explanation. Sounds exactily as The Beatles. Sound is perfect and professional. To be better, the tablature could come with the DVD.",1339718400,,160,5.44
7982753,4,B00008G7UB,"This DVD was pretty good. The teacher walked through many of the riffs and slowed it down to show you what he was playing. This DVD is not for new players. It assumes you know chord forms and positions up and down the neck. A little on screen tab would have helped, but all in all it was a good DVD.",1175904000,4,299,3.918032786885246
7982754,4,B00008G7UB,"This is the most refreshing DVD I've purchased lately. True, no tab, and the songs are not complete. On the bright side, it means you have to TRY a little, and maybe learn something! Playing tab like a robot was starting to get old. Plus, Tom Kolb's personality onscreen makes him an ideal teacher. All the riffs are shown slowly and then up to speed with backing. Learn the riffs, then put on the CD, and before you know it you'll be playing along.",1159228800,,449,4.357142857142857
7982755,1,B00008G7UB,"I bought this DVD in the hopes of learning to play a couple of tunes, and was sadly disappointed.  There is no tablature on the screen to follow along with, nor is there a booklet.  The instructor assumes you know the chords he is using, you won't be able to see his fingering clearly in the video.  When he actually plays a song there is a sort of split screen thing going on, each showing one hand.  I'm not exactly sure how you're supposed to follow along.  I suspect if you're accomplished enough to follow what he's talking about, you don't need the video.",1135555200,4,561,4.355769230769231
