I love the sport and it's a great sport for those girls to watch too. I didn't realize how competitive basketball was back in the day; but by watching this film I got a 360 view. I think as the years go by female sports eventually progress physically in all areas. I know when I played we scrimmaged the guys, worked out a lot, and held our own. In fact I didn't know they had competitive basketball in schools for girls in the 50's til I watched this, WOW. A great film, with great acting, and factual info on the head coach. It is a truly inspiring film!",1474848000,,718,4.172661870503597
