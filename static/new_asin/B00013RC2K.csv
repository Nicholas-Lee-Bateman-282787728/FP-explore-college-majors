1969248,5,B00013RC2K,"This movie is as true and as real as it gets. Teenagers nowadays have it a lot harder than previous generations and it's only bound to get tougher. I have a 3 year old girl and I'm terrified of what she's going to have to go through. Sure, not all 13 year olds go through what the movie shows, but a good percentage of them do. Holly Hunter does an amazing portrayal of a mother who doesn't know what the heck is going on with her daughter, even if it's happening right in front of her face. And if she does have an inkling of an idea, she's in denial. Tracy went from a pretty &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; well rounded girl, to the exact opposite. It may be hard to believe that the transfomation can happen as quickly as it did, but when a child of that age is dying to fit in, they'll do anything to feel accepted. No matter what it is.

 I hope that when/if you have children, you're more in tune to what's going on with the generation's youth. Maybe watching Thirteen again when that time comes will open your eyes a bit more.",1075334400,,1029,4.244897959183674
1969249,5,B00013RC2K,"This movie was a good look at the extremes of what today's teens have to deal with. No matter how much people want to deny the presence of sex, drugs, and depression in our youth, it is definitely out there. Being a teen, I definitely related to the film (even if I haven't done half the stuff they do in the movie).
The acting was second to none. Holly Hunter did a great job in the portrayal of a mother who is struggling with her own problems, while at the same time trying to balance between being a friend and an authority figure to Tracy. I have a feeling that this film was Evan Rachel Woods' big break. There are no words to describe the emotion that she could show in her eyes and how she became the character of Tracy. Nikki Reid (also the co-writer) made her stunning debut as Tracy's best friend Evie. She played the role of the friend you hope your daughter is not hanging out with. She drags Tracy (who is desperate for acceptance) into the scene of drugs, shop-lifting, sex, and rebellion.
After watching this movie, I left the theater still thinking about it. The acting was captivating and the story line hit close to home. It is most definitely not the typical teen rebellion movie, so I beg you not to write it off. I recommend this movie 100%.",1075248000,,1263,4.3559322033898304
1969250,2,B00013RC2K,"I would imagine that are very few thirteen year olds in America could relate to doing and selling hard drugs, slashing their wrists, having sex, shoplifting, and drinking in downtown until dawn.
The two stars (Reed and Wood) are supposed to be 13 year old girls in grade 7.  When in reality they look and act like immature 19 year olds headed for prison.
The movie attempts to portray American teenage girls in such a desolate and corrupt position and does so effectively.  Woods' acting and emotion is well done but the movie remains unbelievable and too fake to be taken seriously.",1074988800,6,583,4.705882352941177
1969251,5,B00013RC2K,"Being a teenager (still) and watching Thirteen was more than great.  I'm not even sure how to describe it.  I don't nessecarily relate to it but I somewhat understand it because I have seen these things happen with my own eyes.  My mom actually brought me to see it and we both enjoyed it and had lots of questions for each other.
I recommend this to everyone; whether they agree with teen drug-use, teen-sex, self-mutilation or not.  Simply because, it's not rare anymore.  It happens all of the time.  It's everywhere.  Not to say that every thirteen year-old is having sex and doing drugs, just that there are the ones that do it.
It's better to be aware than to not know.  That's all.",1074902400,7,688,4.491935483870968
1969252,5,B00013RC2K,"I saw this movie last September when it came out in San Diego, and I don't go one day without this movie passing through my mind. Ive become obsessed, but this movie is the best I've ever seen at capturing California Adolescence, for I was forced into a world of sex, drugs, alcohol, ect when I was in SIXTH grade. Nikki Reed, Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter are an amazing trio. I must say Nikki Reed is probably the best actress (surprising seeing as this is her debut) in the movie at being the malicious, manipulative and devious ""Evie Zamora"". Evan Rachel wood is astounding as well, she truly is amazing. I can relate to this movie so well and many people do, resulting in its popularity. The neat thing about this film is how is was filmed, the camera is very jolty, in your face, and colorful...it makes you feel every emotion, from the moments Tracey (Wood) is high, partying and spinning out of control, you feel the excitement, the fast pace of everything, and also to the sadness, depression and anxiety of a teen living in a dark world where kids want to be adults and independent as fast as possible.
Probably my number one favorite movie ever.",1074816000,3,1160,4.502369668246446
1969253,1,B00013RC2K,"I plan on seeing this movie when it comes out on DVD later this month.  I am writing this ""review"" in response to all the 13 year old girls who claim that this movie is sooo amazingly real.  From what I've heard about this movie, with the drug use, the sex, etc, no 13 year old, or any teen, for that matter, should be relating to it.  If you, as a young teen, can relate to this film, it's time to dump the crowd you are hanging with.  I can't believe that things today are so cRaZy that an old-timer like me (a teen in the 80's) can't begin to relate.  One of two things is going on here:  a small percentage of delinquents are reviewing this movie, giving the impression that the country is screwed, or the country is really screwed.  When I was a teen, it was clear to me what was smart and what was dumb as far as the things that I chose to do in my free time.  I had the strength to resist the temptations of alcohol, drugs, and sex... and no, I wasn't a religious nut fearing that Jesus would send me to hell.  An intelligent person realizes the consequences of these activities and behaves accordingly.
Be wise out there,

1969254,5,B00013RC2K,This movie is so real and so amazing. It really shows how us teens don't have it as easy as many adults do think. We have to deal with tough choices everyday and worry about other things on top of all the peer pressure! this movie should get a million starts but unfortunately it only goes up to five.,1074211200,3,301,4.11864406779661
1969255,5,B00013RC2K,"While reading other customer reviews, I was stunned by the tendency of cynical college types to dismiss this movie as ""eager to be hip"" and ""exploitive garbage"".  If one has not been through an experience, rejecting it when it is displayed must be easy.  However, for those of us like myself, who are thirteen years old, this movie was shockingly real.  And who better to be the judge of that than a thirteen year old, rather than a pretentious college student, now too cool to believe in teen ""angst"" as they call it.
Tracy's (the remarkable Evan Rachel Wood) descent into the world of drugs, casual sex, and smiling lies is a descent I have seen far too often in real life.  Some reviewers were suspicious of the quickness of her progression into this world.  However, one must remember that these are middle schoolers, not twenty-somethings, and the overwhelming insecurity of most 13 year olds allows them to change their images daily.  Also, Tracy is not necessarily a ""good girl"" when the movie begins.  She already smokes, and seems to feel stuck in her life both at school and at home.  This is evident in scenes she shares with her friends, and a particular scene with her mother (Holly Hunter in an incredible performance), where despite her best efforts, Tracy cannot get the attention she needs from her mother, who is wrapped up in most aspects of her own life, especially romantically.
Thirteen is not for those who wish to shut their eyes to what is truly happening to our culture and society.  However, I would recommend that every parent see Thirteen with their child to know the reality of the environment their child is growing up around.  If you are a parent, do not believe for a moment that the experiences of Tracy are experiences that take place everywhere else.  Whether you know it or not, this movie does indeed hit close to home.
A few more notes before I end this review.  Evan Rachel Wood deserves an Oscar for her harrowing performance as Tracy, Holly Hunter is better than I have ever seen her, and Nikki Reed is inspiringly truthful in both her writing and her performance as a character she had not intended to play.  Catherine Hardwicke, as the director, uses her own emotions and vibrant colors to convey the truths hidden behind the masks each character wears.  The obsessive need of the two girls for each other, as a replacement for lack of love in other aspects of their lives, is perhaps the most honest part of this movie.
Whether you enjoy it or not, Thirteen is a movie that must be seen.  More than a social commentary, Thirteen is almost a mirror of reality.",1073606400,69,2604,4.642701525054466
1969256,4,B00013RC2K,"Drawing more than a few comparisons with Larry Clarke's Kids, Thirteen is actually a great deal more restrained and deals with the subject of burgeoning sexuality among thirteen year-old girls in an extremely tasteful way.  It's safe to say that the movie doesn't for one minute exploit the young girls whose story it's trying to tell.  The basic set-up has Evan Rachel Wood becoming best buds with pretty popular Nikki Reed and before you know it she's dabbling in body piercing, boys and drugs.
Thirteen is a difficult movie to review.  Though it has some fantastic performances - not only are the two lead girls impressive, but Holly Hunter is stunning in her role as Wood's confused, terrified hip young mom - it tends to feel a bit overly like a cautionary tale and little else.  The two girls' motives for what they do aren't really explained as anything other than trying to 'fit in', and the breakdown at the end isn't very fulfilling (though in fairness maybe this is the point).  However, it's reasonably hard-hitting, particularly in the scenes where the girls hit each other after drug use because they can't feel anything.  In addition, you can clearly tell Nikki Reed's hand in the scriptwriting process as the movie has a clear 'insider's perspective' feel to it.  In short, though there are many impressive elements to Thirteen, it ignores a lot of the issues surrounding the issues of self-harm and why the transformation in Wood's character is so quick.  Though it's certainly something you'll remember, it's no masterpiece, though this is something in itself compared to the unintelligent and unambitious films on offer most of the year round.",1072483200,3,1662,4.931899641577061
1969306,2,B00013RC2K,"Wow, talk about a roller-coaster of Sex, Drugs, Lying, Thievery, Manipulation, and whatever else these girls could get-away with.
Not really sure why this movie was called ""Thirteen"", as though it were somehow suggesting that it would be all about the ""teenage experience"", or something like that.

First of all, the culture, here, and the kids involved, were a lot closer to High School, rather than Middle School.
At the end of the movie, they said that she was in the 7th grade, and was going to get held back, so, the timeline was off by at least a year, and 99.999% of kids her age are not even touching 1% of this culture.

I could see this kind of thing happening in High School, but this isn't a common thing, if it's a thing at all. (talk about extreme)
I went to some rough Middle Schools growing up, and I actually did some substitute teaching in the same districts, years later, so I have a pretty good grasp of what people are like at this age, and this movie was more focused on an anomaly, if anything, rather than a constant.

I will admit, however, that in the schools I attended, there do seem to be at least a few kids who are doing wild stuff.
At the level these girls were doing things, though?

I dunno about that. (They did everything but kill someone, pretty much)
One thing I did notice, though, that I think is accurate, is that the home environment correlation is pretty close to reality.

ALL of the kids I have ever known, who have been involved in dark things, have had some very tortured and/or damaged parents, or guardians, in their home life.
The way this movie depicts things, though, is pretty horrifying, and I'm not sure it's all too natural.
(It was definitely rushed)

It was almost like the girls didn't go to school, at a certain point.
They were just stealing all the time, and out getting sexual with older guys.

I'm surprised they didn't get raped over and over, or impregnate themselves, given how crazy they were acting.
It was also weird that they both had ""trashy"" mothers, but somehow their moms made enough money to each pay for a house, and everything that comes with it.

I dunno, it seemed a little out there.
Like I said, I do have some real life experience and observations that this kind of thing can go this far, but the movie was pumping it full of Red Bull and tapping the vein.
(They really should have slowed it down)

It was just so crazy, and wild.
They do EVERYTHING wrong, at least once, just about everyday.

I think the casting was pretty good, for the most part, and I rarely say that, but I do think it made sense.
There were some things that were made to be a little more attractive than is probably realistic, but even with a little give-and-take, there, it seemed pretty good.

Another thing I'll give it credit for is the use of some kind of a gradient color filter from the beginning of the movie to the end.
What I mean by that is, at the beginning, the colors were very warm and vibrant, things were alive and full of life, but closer to the end, they started using cooler, darker, more blue and dismal color filters, when things really started to hit rock bottom, and at the very end, when she wakes up in her room with her mom beside her, the warmer, more yellow and vibrant, colors start to come back, almost as though things were going to get better, even though she's devastated by everything that happened, and they kind of try to communicate this struggling teenager frustration, and whatnot.

They really just show the course of events, from the introduction of her crazy friend, to the point where she finally revealed her shallow-evil behavior to her, not that it wasn't obvious of course, and her psycho-friend left her life.
The movie probably should have been titled ""American Girlfriend"", or something like that, because it really was centralized around this chick's sicko-hot-friend that she practically worshiped.

If this were really a movie about the teenage condition, it would be a lot more structured, and stereotypical.
Even further, if this were really a movie about the EXTREME teenage condition, it would still have more of a narrative.

This movie is about a girl who almost destroys her life, because she wants to be close to an attractive girl who is completely insane.
It doesn't really leave you with anything, other than to say, ""Well, don't hangout with psychos"".

I have to say that out-loud, though, because that's the core takeaway, here, even though they want you to think these are the difficulties of the ""teenage condition"", or something like that.
Again, most people don't have this problem, nor are they drawn to even a fraction of the stuff these girls did on a non-stop basis.

I think it started with stealing, and then went to sexuality, then highly manipulative lying, then piercings, then drugs, etc, etc, etc.
Something like that.

This is a production that probably captures the emotion of everything all jumbled together, and it's throwing a fit the entire time.
You might think, ""Well, there you go, it did its job in describing a 13yr old teenage girl"", but I don't think so.

I don't see that as organic presentation of what a teenager is like.
It's a caricaturized, drugged up, insane version, and I think that's disingenuous to the totality of the teenage dynamic.

Again, if this movie were titled, ""American Girlfriend"", or ""Ex-Girlfriends"", or something pointing to the fact that these chicks are nutso, then I would've given it three or four stars! (haha)
It's a sad, upsetting, dark movie about two girls breaking all the rules, I guess, and it has some unattractive qualities that I didn't enjoy very much, to say the least.

Why, that's outrageous, I tell you. Who could possibly believe that a child who suddenly discovers she has the sexy-hot-youthful-vitality, upon which the whole world has always been fixated, might choose to use in in misguided ways?

Could never happen. ALSO: when, 20-30 years later, they subsequently realize that this power has expired, they never, ever--not even once--go equally crazy... just in a different way...

Hmm... Possible sequel: a movie titled THIRTY-NINE. It's about one of these gals and how she left her ""wild child"" days behind her, long ago. She married the best all-around Alpha Male she could cull from the herd. Bore him a couple kids. Did reasonably well as a human being... for a time... But now she must prove she ""still has it"" and we rejoin her as she has run head first into the sort of self-destructive nymphomania that will surely gut everything her husband ever held dear, and will send her kids into life-long therapy.

The End. (And they all lived happily ever after.)

Rumors of light sexual activity and getting high at the park are more or less expectations of the beginning of the teen years. The hard drugs and sex however served as somewhat of a shocker. Strange, the difference one or two years makes in perception. At fourteen I would raise an eyebrow. At fifteen I'd be horrified, but not at all shocked. The thing Hardwick does so impressively here is the realism she creates not just for those privy to this kind of behavior, but those such as myself who have seen it only on occasion. The fact that Reed herself helped write the script at only fifteen years old undoubtedly plays a hand.

Wood, Reed, et al all dazzling, there's no other word to describe it. We feel every uncomfortable, exciting, horrifying and unbelievable moment along with the characters shrouded in a sense of sadness for girls so young. As we enter the 2010s and the new nostalgic period of the 90s and early 00s there are not many films that portray our former lives in a way that is not cringe-inducing or laughable. Here, even the disastrous high-rise-thong/low-cut jean combination still holds some admiration. The long gone (thank goodness) trends still hold sway and you may find yourself looking enviously at the bright clothes and belly tops. The cinematography is fantastic, the music sublime.

I noticed that the bad reviews of this movie usually reference the content, stating that it was ""done before"" and that this movie was trying to be shocking, or comparing it to Korine's ""Kids"" (fair enough) and so on an so forth.  I personally feel like it belongs alongside ""Kids,"" ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", and other similar films, rather than as a competitor - I watched this as an adult in my early college days and it really affected me.  It has always been intertwined in my thoughts about the development of young women during this century.  The way it was filmed is very true to life.  It almost feels like the scenes are spontaneous at times - like when Tracy's mom (Holly Hunter - this was a fantastic casting of her) is doing her best at home - lasagna, listening to Tracy's poetry, hemming her jeans, trying to give her freedom.  I wasn't Tracy. I was her goody two-shoes neighbor friend who got left out.  I know this. I wanted to be Tracy when I was thirteen. I was spared the agony, and left to my own private suffering.  All teen girls should see this, but I personally feel like it is most effective after high school graduation.

1969394,5,B00013RC2K,"There are two great things about this film.
One is the actress Evan Rachel Wood who won most every award when she was very young through this movie. She was truely beautiful and a great actress even though she was really young. She was already in her peak at that time. It is really sad that she is not 29 and she is now and still not yet that famous.
Second, the director Catherine Hardwicke who made the memorable debut through this film and now she is very famous with her movie TWILIGHT.
This movie is very stylish with zoom in/out, and panning. Also using hip hop, rock music makes this movie even more like one of the commercial/music video like modern movie.
That is not all.
The charactor development with Even Rachel Wood and Holly Hunder were simply just great. We all know that Holly is a great actress but other actors like Vanessa Hudgens who played Evan's friend who gave Evan a bad influence was also doing her part very well. Evil and vulnerable at the same time.
The story is about Even Rachel Wood who is living with her mother who was a good student till she met this most populer girl Vanessa Hudgens  in school and had a bad influenced by her. Stealing money, having drugs having sex with cool guys, and so on.
Vanessa Hudgens even tells Holly that she has nowhere to go and stays at Evan's house.
Rachel pierces her bally button and her tongue which made her mother freaked out. She drinks smokes weed sleeps around with various boys.
Discovering all that, her mother Holly finally decides to get rid of Vanessa.
Things becomes normal. But Evan has been changed ever since. She is no more old Evan anymore.
Evan was really pretty and charming. But not only that. She really acted from her heart. She has this anger coming out from her chest which was totally believable and that is not something that you see from everyday.
I thought that she would be a big movie star later. But sadly she was not.
I saw once more from the movie<THE UPSIDE OF ANGER>. She was acting with Kevin Costner and Joan Allen with three other girls. She was one of the child of Kevin and Joan. It was a minor roll. But she was really shining. Sadly she was still not a great star. Now she is 29 and she is still working hard to be noticed more from the audience.
Truely to be recognized from the audiences, it not only needed talent but there need  luck too.
She worked for TV series like <Doll & Em><Robot Chicken> and that prohibited her from apprearing more  movie I guess.
Anyway, this movie is a must watch for movie fans.",1457136000,,2524,4.400428265524625

Hard to believe that seventh graders would have behaved in this manner in the tiny town where I spent my youth, but maybe I was unaware. After all, it was the mid-west and not California. Call me naive, but oral sex at that age?

The main actress flunks the seventh grade and must repeat it. She screams in frustration, but whose fault is it?

I taught in universities in China for seven years and found most of the students to be immature for their age. Some of them behaved like the students in this film . . . but maybe I was naive about what they really knew and how they behaved out of the classroom. I remember during a writing clinic that I started, I about fell out of my chair when a couple of students told me they were 23.

I grew up in a similar middle-class party high school, and although I didn't know anyone like this at 13, it wasn't long after that IN HS when you could see the changes/downward spiral happen in front of you. This movie accurately portrayed the need to ""fit in"" and to feel ""grown up"", the innocence of youth even when stealing or doing drugs, to so called friends' betrayals- the causes, effects/ consequences are all so well done in the movie, it's easy to stay entertained, made me cry at a few points near the end.

1969612,5,B00013RC2K,"This film continues to haunt me years after I first saw it.  ""Thirteen"" is a grim, unsettling portrayal of innocence lost. Tracy Freeland (played by Evan-Rachel Wood) is a good girl...honor student, sweet, well-behaved, has a group of equally nice friends.  She still plays with dolls and sleeps with stuffed animals.
But this all changes when she starts junior high at a new school and is exposed to darker elements.  Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed, upon whom ""Thirteen"" is loosely based) is an exotic beauty with an uncanny resemblance to Cindy Crawford and a maturity far beyond her years.  She is the most popular girl in school, enticing boys with her tanned midriff and long golden-brown hair.

To Tracy, Evie represents all the things she longs to be...alluring, confident, sexy.  Her home life is less than ideal with a recovering alcoholic mother who runs a beauty shop, an absent father, and the mom's loser boyfriend.  Tracy is at the crucial age where young girls start to need attention and validation.  After a crew of mean girls laugh at her quirky outfit, she decides to make a change.
She falls in with Evie's crowd after showing that she will do anything to be accepted.  With a sparkly belly button ring, skimpy clothes, and a new ""tough"" attitude, her bad-girl dreams are coming true.  She explores the world of sex and drugs with Evie by her side.

But all the while, she finds herself being drawn deeper in over her head.  ""Thirteen"" is a riveting, terrifying drama about peer pressure, self-esteem and how parents need to be there for their kids before it's too late.
Wood shines in her sensitive portrayal of a girl seeking acceptance in all the wrong places.  I could see bits of myself in both girls, as I was once a teenager myself.
And Reed steals the show as gorgeous, troubled Evie...the movie offers very little in the way of explaining why Evie is the way she is but there is a hint near the end (no spoilers!)

""Thirteen"" is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen about this subject matter.  During the time period in which it was released, there were a slew of other similar films.  Another film that is more recent and very similar is ""It Felt Like Love"" (2013).
Some people might be uncomfortable with the depictions of teenage substance abuse and sex, but these films can be used as tools in teaching kids about peer pressure and staying true to values/morals.
""Thirteen"" is the gritty world of youth corrupted.  We see a little girl growing up too fast and as viewers, we want to warn her of the dangers out there.
We want to tell her to slow down...she is worth so much more.  And for those of us who are women now, or girls forced to become women too soon, we identify with Tracy's need to feel pretty and to be noticed.

It is obvious that she feels invisible at home and although she loves her small group of friends, the lure of Evie's bad-girl persona gives her a sense of belonging.  She doesn't see herself spiraling out of control until it's too late.  Although ""Thirteen"" isn't too different from the Lifetime movies about young girls getting caught up in bad influences, it offers more insight into Tracy's pain of needing acceptance.
It is also noteworthy that Nikki Reed, the actress playing Evie, is whom the character of ""Tracy"" is based upon.  Nikki admitted in an interview that she was once an honor student who played violin and all of that changed when she fell in with the wrong crowd.  The director/producer felt that Nikki would be more suited to playing ""Evie"", however, than ""Tracy""...she naturally had more of a sexy, vixenish look than Evan-Rachel Wood who embodied the girl next door type.

In all, I give it 5 stars for being an engrossing and realistic portrayal.",1408579200,10,3726,4.653435114503817

Sure its a bit over the top and the parents needed to be blamed a LOT for how this girl ended up but its still important. There were early signs that need to be recognized. So often parents see their 12 year old as their ""baby"" and don't think to check up behind them. My own daughter was moving in a direction I didn't like as soon as she hit 12. Nowhere NEAR like these girls but I saw the beginning signs with the new friends and wanting to wear clothes more mature then she should. We talked. We talked a lot. Was it a sappy kleenex commercial? No. Did it solve every problem she will have as a teen? no. It did open the door for a good line of communication and thats the best any parents can have with a teenager.

Also, it was important for my husband to see this movie. He was an only child and had ZERO experience with raising a teenager girl. She was (and still is) his little princess. Things like thongs and french kissing wasn't even in his princess' mind, right?
HA HA HA HA it helped him a great deal to see how things can go south REALLY quickly if parents are not involved.

This movie is not the best acting and does feel a bit like an After school special. I do not recommend it for kids at that age or going through that stage. I find it would only validate their behavior for them as well as give them ideas....",1396569600,,1391,4.129151291512915

The screen writer and also bad girl (Nikki Reed) acting in the move is based on personal experience.
The movie demonstrate how hard is for a single parent(mostly women) to raise kids and the constant influence those kids are from their piers.

Three things I still remember from the film: the beginning, when Evie and Tracy are hitting each other and can't feel anything; the middle part where ""Lifeguard Boy"" starts playing pinball; and the end, when Tracy wakes up and rides the merry-go-round to Liz Phair's ""Explain It to Me.""

And the fake movie poster for The Misadventures of Ezekiel Balls, starring Jack Black and a pig. Four things.

1969818,3,B00013RC2K,"I watched and bought this movie in my younger days, and just recently watched it again at 30, and I was quite surprised that I even bought this movie. In some respects, it does portray a realistic sense of what it feels like to be 13 - pressure to do drugs, be accepted by the cooler kids, sexual experimentation, and a constant struggle with parents who don't understand you, that much is true. However, my conflicting opinion with this movie is that, this scenario is that of extreme cases of troubled youth, not your average teenager. A good majority of our youth feels these pressures, but they don't react in this extreme sense. Believe it or not, some actually handle different scenarios fairly well, and we actually don't give them enough credit for that.

Holly Hunter plays an outstanding single mother in this movie. She cares deeply about her kids, and lets them know how much she cares about them, but at the same time, she never really has the time to connect with them. For me the more important message in this movie, and from my personal experience, is not that kids fall prey to all the sexual and drug pressures, but that parents who don't spend enough time with their kids lose sight of the fact that they strayed, because of their lack of connection, and interest in what their kids do, or how they feel. Kids may act like they don't care, but they know everything thats going on, even if you don't want them to know. And because adults act as if they aren't wise enough to understand, that frustrates them even more, and makes them feel like they have no say. The outcome is an emotionally neglected teenager, who can't turn to their parents, so they look for other outlets to ease their emotional pain.

A worthwhile movie for parents to watch, but know that it doesn't always become this extreme. I believe Nikki Reed just wrote it this way to make it clear to parents that this can happen if you don't pay attention to your kids, but it's preventable from escalating this far, if caught early.",1309046400,,2017,4.553719008264463
1969819,3,B00013RC2K,"THIRTEEN is either a serious expose' of contemporary urban adolescence -- specifically early female teen culture -- or a contrived, adult tease to put first-time director Catherine Hardwicke on the map.  Evan Rachel Wood is the good girl going bad under the influence of popular Nikki Reed, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Hardwicke.

There's a faux realism to the scenes with teens on their own, and the acting and directing are fine, but I wanted to scream at single mom Holly Hunter to take control of her kid's life. This film does not go nearly far enough to make its point about the power of peer pressure and the corrupting domination of pop culture on kids.",1299974400,,671,4.726495726495727

1969821,3,B00013RC2K,"Essentially, this movie details the journey of a teenage girl as she descends into a life of drug usage and sluthood. It is a commentary on how America's young girls are being transformed into willing whores.

It has been a while since I've seen the movie, but its basic structure has been retained in my mind.

At the beginning of the movie, she is a normal, well-adjusted high school student. Very quickly, she falls into the wrong crowd and becomes all ghetto. The remainder of the movie shows with her wallowing in the aforementioned drug usage and promiscuity.

The movie is intended to shock and is successful in doing so. The maker of the movie shouldn't be attributed undue talent, though, since it is fairly predictable and contains no inspired twists or insights. Nevertheless, it is good in sounding the alarm on the problems facing today's youths (especially girls).

I give the movie 3 stars.",1286496000,,905,4.819354838709677
1969822,4,B00013RC2K,"The movie is based on Nikki Reed's tumultuous life during her adolescence.

The plot follows Wood's character named Tracy as she enters the 7th grade and becomes entranced with her wild classmate Evie (played by Reed). Evie proves to be a terribly influence on Tracy who goes from being an excellent student, blossoming poet, and sheltered young lady to a 13 year old drug abuser who loses her virginity and verbally assaults her family members on a daily basis. Tracy's mother (Mel), played expertly by Holly Hunter, is a recovered drug addict/alcoholic who is trying to save her daughter without getting sucked into back into the drug and alcohol scene herself. As Tracy and Evie become closer friends, Evie makes up lies about her past in order to stay at Tracy's house and win over her family. In addition, Tracy is trying to deal with the fact that her father has a new family and does not have time for her. Just when the tension seems to be at its boiling point, Mel's boyfriend (who is an ex-cocaine addict) moves back in after his stay in the halfway house.

With such a heavy plot, I was skeptical that the young actresses wouldn't be able to pull it all off. I was completely wrong! Wood plays her part so well that I wondered if she had experiences similar to those in the film. Holly Hunter was equally exceptional as was Nikki Reed did not in fact play herself in the film but instead played the antagonist. Once I did some background reading on this movie, I found that it had been written by Nikki Reed and director Catherine Hardwicke in six days and was originally going to be a comedy. This shocked me because the material is so tragic and raw that there isn't even enough humor for a dark comedy. It was equally impressive to read that it was written in such a short time period because the characters are very well developed. Of course it has its pitfalls, but the majority of them hit in the first half an hour of the film. At times the script feels clunky, but it never interferes with the action or emotion of the movie.

The story really got to me. 13 year old Tracy wanted to fit in with the popular girls at school, most notably Evie. Tracy gets Evie's number to hang out, only for it to be a non working number. She goes to the shop where Evie was shoplifting, and she intentionally gave Tracy a wrong number. She pick pocketed a lady at a bus stop, and Tracy instantly becomes Evie's friend. Although she is with the popular crowd, she shuns her old friends and follows Evie in the path of sex and drugs. She also self mutilated her arm a few times in the movie (I have went through a minor phase like that when I was 14) whenever she got really stressed.

Evie had a depressing background, as she said she was abused by her guardian's boyfriend and such. She wanted to be adopted by Tracy's family. She envied Tracy because she had the things she wanted (a mother, family love, etc). She was not adopted and betrays Tracy near the end of the film.

Near the end, Tracy was on the verge of failing the 7th grade, I will not spoil any further now.

Parts of the movie did make me cry, a little. Such as seeing Evie crying because she didn't get adopted, and the ending which I will not reveal in this review. Stuff like this is happening out there in real life and I really want to do something about it. I have watched this film about 12 times so far. Overall, this is a really great and a depressing move, parents and teachers should show this film to teenagers, especially if they turned 13.

If you liked this movie, you will like Ken Park's ""Kids"", which has a more grittier feel as opposed to Thirteen's Hollywood feel. Plus Kids is much more graphic, and if that was not enough for you, you should also watch ""Ken Park""",1246147200,,1729,4.3076923076923075

I thought the acting was brilliant and the desaturated scenes added a lot to the feel of the movie. The last scene I carried with me for days.

1969834,4,B00013RC2K,"Catherine Hardwicke is red hot right now due to her direction of Twilight, which is a huge block buster with box office receipts that guarantee a sequel--but guess who won't be directing said sequel? It doesn't seem fair that she won't get to milk the cash cow she spawned, but perhaps it is best, as she would no doubt chaff under the restrictions imposed upon her. She is an indie director through and through, though with her uncanny knack for feeling the pulse of the youth market she will no doubt strike gold again. She discovered the vampire novels of Stephenie Meyers through her younger pals, and at a book signing she saw immediately the strong reaction and fan loyalty the books engendered. Indeed, author Stephenie Meyers had laid the groundwork herself by social networking, blogging and emailing her fans, even reviewing fan fiction based on her characters.

Two of Catherine's other films also benefited from her ability to see the world from the younger point-of-view: The Lords of Dogtown; and the film I will review here, thirteen. Dogtown was a great film about the skate scene. My favorite Hardwicke story from that is when she got so carried away directing a skateboard scene in a drained swimming pool that she fell in and had to be rushed to the hospital. When she woke up, she had a flashback, because the doctor was speaking the exact same lines of dialogue from her script, from when one of the skaters had an accident. It is that kind of reckless passion that she brings to her films.

--------------------
[first lines]
Tracy: Hit me. I'm serious; I can't feel anything, hit me! Again, do it harder! I can't feel anything, this is awesome!
===================================

thirteen tells the story of a strained relationship between a mother (Holly Hunter) and daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) as the daughter goes through a rebellious adolescent phase of shoplifting, drugs, and cutting herself with a razor blade, spurred on by her friend Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed), a popular but troubled teen who envies the relatively stable home she has.

------------
[as underage Evie tries to seduce him]
Luke: No. Bad. Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
=============================

The script was written by Nikki Reed in only six days, based on her own experience, which was closer to the daughter character than the part she played. Director Hardwicke collaborated on the script, shaping the raw material and probably projecting herself into the mother role, if you will forgive me a little amateur psychoanalysis.

---------------------
[Tracy is on the phone in a tattoo shop]
Tracy: Hey Mom, do you know what point-slope form is? No, me neither. See? That's why I need to be here... at the library.
==================================

Holly Hunter is great as the mom, trying to be her daughter's best friend, but with her own issues, and a boyfriend (Jeremy Sisto) just out of rehab it's a difficult task. Sisto was familiar from his role on the popular TV show, ""Law & Order"" where he plays Detective Cyrus Lupo. Here he seems like he is trying to be a father figure, but as an ex-addict, he has neither her respect nor the patience to deal with her trauma drama.

----------------
Tracy: So, Brady, how was the halfway house?
Brady: Same as the last one, Tracy.
==============================

Though her mom wants to be her best friend, what she really needs is a mom, and a dad would be nice, too. Unfortunately, her dad (D.W. Moffett) sees her so rarely that he really can't comprehend what her problem is and what she needs. Her brother, Mason (Brady Corbett) doesn't get along with her so great, either. Sometimes he is annoyed, sometimes he is horrified, and sometimes he is in awe of the fast track she is on:

--------------------
Tracy: Hey Mason, who would you say is the hottest girl in school?
Mason: Evie Zamora.
Tracy: Guess who I hung out with today.
Mason: Bull.
Tracy: Melrose Avenue. (Mason looks at her in awe) What? Like that's so hard to believe...
==================================

thirteen is a shocking and heavy movie, all the more shocking to think that lots of teens are going through this. For instance, cutting your arm with a razor blade seems to be so irrational yet it is all too common. It seems that these problems are even worse in Hollywood/Los Angeles with so many of the parents not really grown up themselves--going through the same issues themselves. Though the reality it depicts is shocking, the script, direction, and acting don't flinch. Also, though put to the test, the mother's love doesn't falter, and the film ends on a muted note of optimism.

1969835,5,B00013RC2K,This is one of my favorite movies EVER... and that is quite a compliment. It really gives a great look into what life is like for 13 year olds growing up in the world today. Not much else needs to be said... the other reviews say it all. I highly recommend this movie.,1219968000,,268,4.0754716981132075
1969836,5,B00013RC2K,"I feel a need for a disclaimer here.  This is a positive review, I thought Thirteen was a very good film.  Okay disclaimer covered.
Imagine two hours of sitting in a pit of eels after drinking eighteen cups of coffee.  That's about as uncomfortable as the two hours I spent watching Thirteen.  It is a testament to the film that the material rings so true as to elicit such feelings.  The phrase teenage angst has never been so woefully insufficient as in this instance.  The story of Tracy and her family is so visceral and genuine that one is instantly transformed back to early post puberty and the horribly uncomfortable issues that were part and parcel of the experience.  We follow Tracy as she seeks popularity through her relationship with the most popular girl in class, Evie.  In this post-modern LA junior high school, popularity is as perilous as typhoid, with overt sexual availability and attenuated childhood creating beings of mature facade but illusory foundation.  Inevitably Tracy and her post-modern family ferociously spiral into a decent tempered only by it's brevity.  As an adult I look at the film now as both man and child and am horrified from both views.  The issues of needing to belong and wanting admiration are represented as truly as film has ever managed.  The issues of reckless sexuality and self destruction allow me even as one without children to know the deep fear of having your child self immolate.  There are very few good feelings within this movie but oddly you do feel better for going through it.  I guess that is really the ultimate and fitting compliment for the filmmakers that they have managed to take the audience through the emotions that are the beginning of the teenage years.  Few films I know have had this much emotional impact.  I'm not sure I'm ready for many more.",1216252800,3,1826,4.767515923566879
1969837,5,B00013RC2K,"I've seen ""Kids"", Bully and all the other teens gone bad movies...Thirteen is the one that really got me! It broke my heart, and scared the hell out of me! I have a daughter (17) and this is real! It can happen if you allow it too or if your luck is bad enough for some good ole' fashion Karma to catch up 2 you. Katherine Hardwick(Lords Of Dogtown)and Nukki Reed wrote this script in a week...a semi-autobiographical telling of Reed's real life. There's drugs, sex, cutting, and alcohol running freely in Evies(Redd) world and Tracy( Woods) sees it and wants in...at what cost though? Holly Hunter sells the stressed out on the edge herself Mommy....equipped with an unsuccessful home buisness, smoking and alkie abuse herself as well as letting men abuse her too...Physiologically she sells Tracy to Evie and is a sucker for their tricks until it goes too far and Hunter's character puts her foot down and loves her daughter back home...she has to put space between Evie and Tracy, which finally happens but before you see Tracy and Evie use drugs, alcohol, sex and go thru a cutting phase that's very real...Nikki Reed is an amazing talent( recognized form Lords of Dogtown and Cherry Crush) wow!!! This girl has it in a sexy way...young but extremely sexy in her roles...she could have redone lolita and knocked it out of the park. This is a real look into the world of teen girls gone to the other side...be careful not all come back home...this is a movie for every dad and mom to watch & breathe in...it can happen to you too! the language used and the description of sex, cutting, drugs, breaking the law(theft)is truly eyeopening.",1215475200,2,1639,4.674740484429066
1969838,4,B00013RC2K,"Special features could have been more extensive, but I enjoyed the audio commentary with director and actors.  Evan Rachel Wood does a fantastic portrayal of Tracy.  The cinematography is beautiful and fitting to the story.",1212364800,2,223,5.3428571428571425
1969839,4,B00013RC2K,"I work with teenagers and the best way for me to describe many of them is with the word ""nutcases"", particularly the females who often will do whatever it takes to be considered socially relevant. 13, the film, is a pure depiction of a large contingency of our current female youth culture. They are rebelling, and don't know why; they are seeking, but don't know what for. All they really want at the end of the day is a feeling of belonging and being sought after, even if they truly don't know what that means or what it will take to get it.

Holly Hunter plays the mother of a floundering teenaged girl as her daughter falls deeper and deeper into a world of teenaged angst that ultimately leaves the entire family unit besieged with an overwhelming aftertaste of pain and remorse.

This is a hard film to take, but a necessary one for those parents who might not understand their kids, but are willing to try to gain a better outlook  into their bipolar little worlds.",1212019200,2,973,4.4858757062146895
1969840,5,B00013RC2K,I have 3 Girls and it show them to not do drugs and the pressure of teenagers and the dangers of peer press it's a excellent movie i would recommmend it to others,1209859200,2,162,3.9393939393939394
1969841,4,B00013RC2K,"I liked this movie.  It shows a good idea of what being an adolescent can be, these days.  I think that there are some issues that could've been left out, like the part where she cuts herself, or when we see Holly Hunter in the vulnerability of her nakedness... It would've been, then, showed to my students, who are reading ""Go Ask Alice"".  It would've been a good life lesson for them.  All in all, I recommend it to families that are in need of a good ice breaker on the topic of drugs and other related issues... Thank you!",1206316800,3,527,4.24
1969842,5,B00013RC2K,"I hate to say that this movie reminds me a lot of my own adolescence. I too was a good girl growing up in Santa Monica, whose childhood came to an abrupt end when I entered middle school. I still remember how unprepared I was to find myself in a world that only cared about boys and wild fun, and I was even less prepared to discover that I was pretty interested in these things myself.

There seems to be some debate as to whether Tracy's descent into teenage hell is realistic in terms of its severity and speed. As for myself, I never snuck lines of coke in my bedroom, but plenty of my classmates did.

What struck me most about this movie was not the drugs or the sex, though both are certainly disturbing. What this movie really captures is how difficult it is for both parents and children to renegotiate their relationship when the kids become teenagers. One day Tracy tells her mother that she can never stay mad when her mom strokes her hair, and the next, she's screaming that no one can enter her bedroom unannounced. Tracy doesn't just make foolhardy decisions. She also makes necessary ones albeit with an adolescent lack of tact. The movie does not tell us if Tracy manages to grow up unscathed, but there's no doubt that she is gowing up. No matter what else happens, she'll still be a sexual being who is no longer comfortable being naked in front of her mother. She'll probably still want to keep her bedroom door closed. She'll want to shop on Melrose Place without an accompanying adult.

""Thirteen"" is unsparing in this regard. We see Tracy's need to separate, and her mother's sorrow at this loss. Holly Hunter does a magnificent job as a mother who suddenly finds herself without any connection to or authority over her child. Her daughter is as tall as she is, and no longer responds to announcements that ""it's conference time!"" There is one particularly tragic moment when Hunter plaintively reminds her daughter that ""I raised you to be civil to me!""

I've watched this movie probably a dozen times and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it. I'll never get tired of seeing Tracy and her new pal Evie running around LA, flaunting their newly adult bodies, but screaming like the kids they still are. Growing up is hard to do.",1203724800,3,2252,4.525798525798526
1969843,2,B00013RC2K,I bought this movie for my sister and it is so sad.  It is about teenagers hence the title and they shop lift and cut themselves and it is just sad at what some people do.  I guess if you have gone through some of that stuff and have overcome that then I think it is a great movie for you.  If you get sad easily by other peoples pain then stay away from this one.  It is so sad and it makes me sad that people go through this stuff.  I gave it three stars because it was original and came from the heart.,1200960000,,505,3.7714285714285714
1969844,5,B00013RC2K,I love this movie it is definitely one of my all time favorites.  I actually saw this movie a few years ago on t.v. and I had to get it.  Before I started online shopping of course because everywhere I went for the dvd it was not in stock.  Even when I worked at a retail store we couldn't keep it in stock either.  But thanks to amazon I got a good copy and it is a great movie for teenagers and up.  It is definitely worth the price.,1199750400,3,435,3.842696629213483
1969845,3,B00013RC2K,"This isn't as bad as what people claim. I for one work in the mental health field, and am exposed to kids like this everyday. True, the movie is not the most believable overall, yet it shows the struggle of a mother trying to hang on to a rebellious child. This is based on a lot of factual issues kids deal with everyday in this area of New York. Its certainly not uncommon to see a child this out of control. The spiraling of a child who starts stealing to be cool and fit in, to self mutilation and using drugs to oppositional defiance. Not uncommon that the family is equally dysfunctional. No real father figure and a mother who lost contact with her kid and has nothing but love to offer the child. The child is looking for more than love and easily falls prey to becoming a hopelessly labeled child. The ending was somewhat anti-climatic however, and really detracted to the height of the movie. Maybe I was hoping for too much to happen and a different story line ending. Acting is average and certainly very watchable. The plot is somewhat predictable, yet is able to keep you interested in the story line. Watch without expectations.",1194307200,5,1143,4.5
1969846,4,B00013RC2K,"This movie utterly gave me the creeps, because I'm 23 and this is dead-on what it felt like to be in middle school where I grew up. What scared me was the fact that between then and now little has changed, apart from the current trend in new reports on elevated school violence and shootings in suburban areas. I remember the angst that this movie portrays of what it was like to be 13. No, I never once a teenage girl. I was a teenage guy, but I can still remember the mindset that we all subscribed to back then, and this is it. I remember how uncool it was to do well in school. When I got good grades I would hide it from my friends and occasional deliberately flunk a test just to show how ""bad"" I was. Stealing was considered ""cool"" and nobody wanted to be thought of as ""faggot"" or ""fudgepacker"".

When I watched this movie with my little sister, who was 16 at the time, she told me that this film could have been filmed yesterday and no one would have noticed much of a difference. Life is still hard in being a teenager and the pressure to be part of the ""in crowd"" is still very great. This movie would serve as an excellent warning to somewhat naive parents as to what's still out there and as an important message to teens as to why being ""cool"" isn't all it's cracked up to be and that there are more important things in life than being popular or hanging out with certain ""friends"".

Some parts of this film left me bored, while other parts of this film struck an intimate chord with me. If you don't get at least something from this film, whether it's a distant memory or a warning about today, then I think it's either because you grew up at a much different time (not in the late 20th or early 21st century) or you don't closely know of any teenagers.",1190592000,2,1768,4.212389380530974
1969847,4,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen is a movie about how a young teenage girl, seeks the attention of another more popular girl at her school. She wants to befriend this girl, and does out of character things to achieve this goal. I think that this movie portrays peer dependency accurately. Many young adolescents find themselves doing things they never would have until their ""friends"" came along. I think that this movie shows that the girls are doing drugs, sneaking out, hooking up with boys is typical. It might seem extreme in this movie but, I think thats exactly how it is. However I must say that in this movie the girls are in seventh grade, whereas maybe they should have been a little older. If they had set the girls at an older age they could have shown how they know older kids which means access to more stuff. They could have also even show how high-school students use their cars  to hotbox or hook up. Showing the more graphic lifestyle of teens is easier if they are older. However this was indeed a great movie!",1184544000,2,1006,4.527472527472527
1969848,5,B00013RC2K,"The first time I watched `thirteen' I was stunned at how brutally honest a film it was.  It's so easy for Hollywood to sugar-coat reality to make it accessible but here that is far from the case.  In it's honesty though it never crosses the line in becoming so overtly dramatic and edgy that it comes across forced and in other words Hollywoodized.  `thirteen' stays true and relatable and effortlessly absorbing.  While watching the film I found my heart invested in the story, in the characters and in their eventuality.  I really cared for everyone involved in different ways and for different reasons.  The cast, I should immediately point out, is so brilliant here that they really help keep this film true to form and each actress adds layers of honesty to her performance.

Evan Rachel Wood blew me away with her performance as Tracy Freeman.  Tracy is your average thirteen year old girl.  She's awkward around boys, teased at school, distant from the popular girls, estranged from her parents, longing to be accepted by her peers as well as her father.  Her whole life seems a waste.  Her mother Melanie is a recovering alcoholic who damages her family with her choice of male companions but who is genuinely trying to make things good again for her children.  Tracy's father is never around to lend a hand in the matter and can't seem to find the time in his schedule to give his daughter the attention she needs.  In order to vent her frustration and find some control Tracy resorts to smoking and cutting.

Tracy them meets Evie Zamora, the popular girl in school.  She's overly sexual, malicious and dangerous and these qualities immediately draw Tracy in.  She begins to conform to Evie's standards and a shift begins to take place in Tracy's attitude and her actions.  Melanie, the maternal instinct kicking in, spots this change early on but is unable to take evasive action.  Evie's family life is tragic as well.  Her parents are no where to be seen and her cousin who acts as her guardian is so uninvolved and lenient with Evie that her behavior, as drastic and outlandish as it is, is welcomed, even encouraged.  Melanie sees this and feels almost guilted into accepting this girl, a girl who gets no real love and attention elsewhere.  While Tracy distances herself further from her mother, Evie uses this opportunity to attach herself, reaching out to that motherly concern, love and guidance she's lacked all her life.

The film spirals down to a breathtaking ending that resolves much and brings to the fore true intentions.  It's beautifully scripted by director Catherine Hardwicke and co-star Nikki Reed, who plays Evie.  Reed is tragic as Evie, really captures the essence of this girl lost in the shuffle and her breakdown in the end of this film is beautifully captured in all its raw reality.  Her character finally emerges in truth and honesty before everyone's eyes and as her exposure is made clear the sheer brilliance of her performance is made manifest as well.  Holly Hunter well deserved her Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Melanie is sincere and heartbreaking.  But no one here deserves more praise than Evan Rachel Wood who devours her role and delivers such tempered and controlled emotions, delivering believability and honesty in each brilliantly calculated move.  Watching her character transform in each scene is effortless and captivating.

`thirteen' may be hard to stomach sometimes, especially if you're a parent, and even more so if you are a parent of a young daughter.  As much as it may remain difficult I feel it's also very important that you force yourself through it.  It exposes quite well the dangers surrounding young girls today, from the desires and pressures to conform to your peers and the enticing effects of drugs, alcohol and sex, vices that are becoming more and more accessible to kids of younger and younger ages.  Directed with equal measures grit and concern, `thirteen' is a landmark film that sheds a much needed light on the dangers of adolescence and is one of the more moving and socially important films of the past decade.  By far the greatest film of 2003.",1183334400,,4142,4.844950213371266

I was hoping it would be along the lines of kids, but nowhere near the intensity of that movie.  The characters in this movie are two dimensional, which makes the movie even more unbeleivable.

1969853,1,B00013RC2K,"I'd heard good things about Thirteen and approached it with high hopes, but not only was it completely alienating, it was ludicrous. There wasn't a plot to be found, there was a catalog of teenaged ills woven loosely into a series of disjointed scenes that tell a predictably melodramatic screech of a story of a single mother's experiences with her one-dimensional ""good daughter gone bad."" It was as if the filmmakers proceeded with a checklist of adolescent issues, and ticked them off one by one. ""Okay, now let's progress from shoplifting to smoking to drinking to slutty wardrobe changes to soft drugs to hard drugs to huffing to self-mutilation, and then we'll get into the repercussions of all that and call it a message film."" It was really that transparent, and really that silly. Thirteen had no style. It was disturbing but unlike another infinitely superior and far more disturbing ""troubled teens"" movie, Larry Clark's  1995 shocker, Kids, this was more of an alienating, grossed-out, slovenly sort of disturbing. To be candid, Thirteen reminded me of those artless ""this could happen to you"" scare tactic films that get shown in health class and church camps in an attempt to frighten impressionable youths away from the rebellious life. Heck, it even wrecked a good song in that I can no longer hear Liz Phair's ""Explain It To Me"" without associating it with the merry-go-round shot in the closing moment of this gosh-awful movie. I'll say here what has to be the worst thing anyone can say about a movie: I wish I had never seen it!",1170201600,7,1549,4.845283018867924

I bought this to watch with my daughter but have not brought myself to sit down and share this with her.  It was a little too explicit for me and am worried that it dramatizes rather than discourages such behavior.  Watch before allowing young girls to watch.

1969858,4,B00013RC2K,"I sat down and watched this movie on a bootleg about 2 years ago, thinking it would be the stupidest thing ever but a good way to kill some time.  I was um, well, I was a little wild from the time I was about 14-18.....who wasn't?  But I looked much older than my age, didn't talk to guys older, got piercings without my mother's knowledge, battled with weight issues, even went through the adolecent female issues of wanting to kill myself.  So, this movie brought back a lot of memories...

I enjoyed it, but didn't like that only one girl had a conscience (Tracy).  The fact of the matter is that both should have broken down, it was clear that there was an issue of attention and feeling important, wanting to be popular....even more evident in Evie's interactions with the boys her age....

This movie is a great conversation piece.  I would recommend it to you IF you have kids, and wonder what they think about.  It's a great showcase for what teens find important, and what's a possible outcome for ignoring your kids, or not talking to them, or for thinking that nothing bad can happen to them.",1158019200,6,1103,4.48

1969860,5,B00013RC2K,"When you think of the worst parts of your adolescence, the point in time when everything fell apart...you think of `thirteen'...one of the most disturbingly real films I've ever seen.  Written by Nikki Reed, who co-stars in the film, this film covers so well the transition of troubled youth.  The film is about Tracy Freeman (Evan Rachel Wood), a thirteen year old girl who isn't living in the best of circumstances.  Her father is never around, her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is a recovering alcoholic who just asked her ex-junkie boyfriend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) to move back in.  Tracy finds her means of escape by smoking and cutting, but it isn't until she meets the rebellious Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed) that she finds plenty of other means to release her inner frustration.

Upon returning to school Tracy is thrust into a life she didn't expect.  She realizes that she doesn't fit in and wants to, especially when she sees that the boys pay her no attention, but instead are gawking at the `prettiest girl in school' Evie.  She befriends Evie, who quickly engulfs Tracy in her world of drinking, drugs and sex.  As her attitude and rebellious habits rage havoc on her home life her mother starts to take maters into her own hands with less than positive results.  Her efforts continue to create more problems as Tracy bucks her authority, at times even using Evie against her mother.

This film isn't shy about exposing the secret lives of teenagers.  In all it's brutality it shows how fast and how deep these girls fall into a world they can't handle.  There are plenty of times you can read all over Tracy's face the fact that she's scared, nervous that she's going too far.  But when she's scared she just looks at Evie, and follows suit.  You can see the power of peer pressure, the power that self image and the constant criticism of your friends and even those who are just observers can have on you.  Tracy makes changes to finally fit in, to finally feel accepted.  She doesn't feel that acceptance anywhere else.  She has a father who doesn't love her enough to keep his dates to see her, a mother who cares so much but is unable to show it the ways Tracy would like.

Evie is another story altogether.  She has a mother who isn't around and a father who isn't around and a guardian, her cousin Brooke (Deborah Kara Unger), who doesn't care enough to enforce any rules or guidelines and just lets Evie roam as she wants.  Evie is reaching for love from anyone, so much so that she reaches to the wrong people.  When she enters Tracy's life she is immediately drawn to Melanie, the loving mother she never had.  You can see the difference in the two girls, Tracy being the girl who takes for granted the love she has and Evie being the girl that longs to have that kind of love.

Melanie to me is the most interesting character, for she's not the perfect mother but she tries, she struggles to make the right decisions and she beats herself up for the wrong ones she makes.  She's selfless and devoted yet she always seems to come up short in the eyes of her daughter.  Holly Hunter does and extraordinary job of playing the tortured mother, battling with her demons both self inflicted and those brought on by the ones around her.

`thirteen' is a brilliant film, brutal in it's deliverance which adds to the authenticity and believability, never sugar coating the truth but exposing everything leaving nothing to the imagination.  The performances by the entire cast are amazing, Wood, Hunter and Reed bringing grit and truism to this modern day masterpiece.  Woods performance in particular is pure brilliance, transitioning from a sweet and innocent girl suffering from naivety to a cruel and heartless girl suffering from naivety almost effortlessly.  This film will startle you but hopefully it will open your eyes to the problems and issues that really do exist and help us take notice of the dangers facing our youths.  Disheartening and beautifully done, Reed has proven to be a convincing writer and actress, and Catherine Hardwicke handles this film with the proper balance of care and caution delivering one of the most powerfully moving movie experiences to come along in recent years.",1155859200,4,4215,4.710777626193725

Tracy is played by the gifted Evan Rachel Wood (Once and Again). Wood is so good in this film that you will forget that she is not of legal age. Holly Hunter plays her mom Mel, sometimes I felt like throwing her character against a wall, you just want to wake her mother up and tell her what's wrong with this situation. I really enjoyed the audio commentary by the director and co-writer Nikki Reed, also features Wood. This film was shot in less than a month and had a very small budget. But this film is haunting and i love how the director changes the color to absolute drainage towards the end of the film. You will be astonished by Wood, she will proabably revceive an oscar in the next 10 years. This is a film you have to watch, especially if you are a parent of a teen. The scenes where Tracy is cutting herself are a little graphic and intense but this problem is really happening to young girls in America.

This is the type of movie that parents would do well to screen with their preteen kids, daughters in particular.  It would go a long ways towards pre-empting some of the inevitable ""rebellious phase"".  Take it from me, I used to babysit my friend's teenage daughters.  We were very close, and I considered myself a second mother to them (even better, albeit only slightly, than their frequently absent biological mother - though I can't blame her entirely, what with the pressures of her day job).  It wasn't too far into their teen years, and ""high school careers,"" that I ended up not being ""cool"" or ""hip"" enough to be seen in public with them.  Plus they got old enough that their real mother didn't need to continue paying me a rather fair salary for sitting services (though in retrospect, she was a bit stingy with raises, a point of contention that has led to a degree of mutual bitterness between her and I).

What I appreciated about ""Thirteen"" was how the 'good-girl' was gradually drawn in by her wilder friend - it happens very typically, and some of you who consider yourself ""good parents"" probably aren't even aware of it.  Look at Holly Hunter in this movie, who's own pride and joy slowly slips away from her without her even realizing.  Ms. Hunter must have some personal experience with questionable parenting becaus she uncannily nails her character with a performance that suggests an emotional wreck.  I know how she feels, because when my girls began straying I didn't see it until it was too late.

1969893,5,B00013RC2K,"I have read many reviews on the movie ""Thirteen"" and am quite frankly surprised at just how, well, SURPRISED some of you all are that something like this could ever happen to someone 'so young.' News flash, folks: this kind of stuff has been happening for decades and it will sadly continue to happen on a daily basis to numerous young people, girls and boys. I know when I was 13, I was pure hell, and I made sure my parents knew it.

I think ""Thirteen"" is a brillantly done movie, nothing less than dark and gritty in nature, and it starts out rather innocent. Young Tracy, who is a straight-A student and very much on the reserved side, just wants to belong to something bigger than herself, to somehow escape from all her household problems which continue to brew just below the surface. She does eventually find an escape in human form - enter Evie, a popular and beautiful young girl, troubled in many ways herself, who grabs Tracy by the hand and leads her into a world of drugs, sex, and just pure rebellion all in a scarily short period of time. Yeah it's true, it all happened so fast in the movie - but common sense would tell any viewer that, well, movies are kind of suppose to get straight to the point. ""Thirteen"" isn't just a movie that depicts what teenagers today are getting involved in; it's a movie that depicts just how much younger the age in which teenagers become involved in such activities are becoming, and very accurately I might add. I would not recommend this movie to the faint of heart. I would, however, recommend this movie to anybody with young teens, regardless of whether you agree with the activities going on in the movie or not. Open your eyes, folks. Not everbody grows up in a sheltered, perfectly made-up home, and even the ones who do don't always make it out unscathed by the hardships caused by the difficult transition from childhood to adulthood.",1140566400,3,1895,4.54093567251462

I don't really think this film is a shock for parents but more of a wake up call to let them know what they think they know they really don't know. Thirteen also presents the problem of the single mother that gives her child space and whatever else she can but her daughter is still going in the wrong direction. She was an A student and the perfect happy daughter but peer pressure is all it takes to change someone.

The amount of bad language is right on target and some may say it's not but I know tons of kids that learn bad words before and while their in elementary school. Thirteen is a tender age and how can you say this is an unrealistic movie when you see kids this age on TV all the time and they go from perfect kids to disrespecting their parents, getting terrible grades, doing drugs, and anything else that is a parent's nightmare. Not every child is the same nor is the community that surrounds them but even with good support this happens and it happens more than people think. Thirteen shows the truth and no not all teens do this but a good percentage of them do.

It shows the teen life in a way that all teens know but adults do not and if thirteen is this bad wait till people see how hard it is being sixteen and seventeen these days. The acting is sharp and the kids do look like they're thirteen. It's a good film for a teen to watch with their mom and dad and every once in a while during the movie parents ask your kid if they are having these types of problems.",1140220800,2,1643,4.099378881987578

I wanted to see this movie so I could compare it to my teenage drama.  It reminded me how scary those years can really be.  One day you're an innocent child, the next you're addicted to drugs, stealing from people that are close to you, selling drugs.  Its real and it happens even in the nicest suburbs.

The acting is phenomenal and is emotional intensity is high.  The cinematography is nice as well.  There is not a lot of character development, but the film still pulls it off.

I do believe however, that this stuff doesn't happen to thirteen years old...unless you maybe live in the ghetto or something. Most of any problems with drug use or alcohol or anything like that happened to me when I was sixteen- not thirteen. This movie however, is dead on with all the problems and issues teenagers face from alcohol use to drug use to shoplifting to sex to family and friendship struggles.

This movie doesn't intend to follow any specific ""plot line"" or story. If you are looking for a happy ending- don't watch this movie. This movie simply shows you what can go horribly wrong to someone as sweet and innocent as the ""earlier"" Tracy.

I do believe parents should watch this movie but I think thirteen as I mentioned before, is an unrealistic age. It's just like how they do D.A.R.E. programs in 5th grade...I was in elementary school learning about long division and some cop is telling me about cocaine? I didn't even know what cocaine was- just like how thirteen is a bit early to explore most of the issues Tracy and Eva experience.

The rest of the movie deserves one star. Without rehashing the plot, which other reviewers have done, my problem with the movie is that it offers no context for anyone's behavior, and there is no character development. Instead, it takes two attractive young actresses and puts them through a series of scenes that get increasingly degrading. In this way, the movie attempts to evoke a variety of emotions, through shock value, with each scene more outrageous than the last. There are no characters, no issues, and no context. The shock value makes the movie seem powerful at first, but then easily forgettable. About halfway through, it becomes apparent that the writer has nothing to say, and despite ever more scenes of sex, drugs, and violence, it becomes quite boring. A much more interesting story would have focused on the ""uncool"" girls at school who we see here and there persevering in class and trying to make it through these years as the ""cool"" girls heap abuse on them.",1135987200,3,1081,4.8432432432432435
1969901,5,B00013RC2K,"Hunter and Wood portray the most realistic mother-daughter dynamic of modern cinema.  Hunter's mother character is world-weary, trying to keep her head above water while staying sober, making ends meet, and trying her damndest to reach out to her 13-year-old daughter.  Wood's character is rebelling in the worst way, throwing every one of her mother's actions back in her face, exploding at the drop of a hat, and trying to form her own identity (albeit not a very positive one).  Any mother-daughter pair will recognize themselves in the elements of the movie, as the mom tries to please her daughter and the daughter gets irritated with every maneuver.

The Evie character (Nikki Reed, co-writer of the story) was a master manipulator, wise beyond her years.  She managed to win over the mom, to play herself off as a victim of abuse, while she was actually the driving force ruining the daughter's life.

This isn't just a movie about a 13-year-old, although her antics makes for some of the best screentime.  It's a movie about a mother-daughter relationship--a mom with her own shortcomings and challenges trying to hold on as her daughter rejects all the trappings of civilized life.",1135468800,2,1190,4.97979797979798
1969902,3,B00013RC2K,"First the good, ""Thirteen"" is a well acted horror of a story. Newbi teenager Tracy, the product of what appears to be a dysfunctional low-income household, seeks attention from Evie, the popular girl at school. Evie (played by Nikki Reed) is a selfish, shallow, vain, overly developed, mess of a young girl. To get ""in"" with Evie, Tracy steals a stranger's wallet to fund an impromptu shopping spree. A friendship is made and over the course of the next four months and the girls end up using each other to their own self-destruction. It's an interesting spiral to watch, the characters are well written and the situations do feel real (this in part to Nikki Reed's own experience as a teenager which she interjected into the script as co-author). I have seen few films that capture, so well, the utter pain, confusion, and need for attention that some teenagers go through.

Now the bad, to make this movie work however, things are exaggerated and accelerated. Tracy goes from a pig tailed sweetheart to a teenage tramp, engaging in threesomes, piercing, drug use, and theft in the matter of four short months. The film has been promoted as a ""wake up call"" to parents, and though the scenarios feel real, the overall situation seems forced. Most parents will not have to face these problems and for those that do, there seems to be few answers. In the film, Tracy's mom (Holly Hunter) has a hard time finding a line to draw for her daughter, which is heartbreakingly accurate, but the movie never provides us with a solution. Tracy's mom never really draws that line and Tracy is only saved by luck.

The director Catherine Hardwicke tells a good story but gets a little too clever with some of her shots. Her creativity is put to good use in the beginning of the film when Tracy and Nikki size each other up by what they are both wearing, but that creativity is lacking near the end of the movie when Tracy and her mom fight. To show the turmoil, Hardwick rocks the camera, it's a amateurish move that makes their fight look like something out of the old Batman TV show.

""Thirteen"" is a good movie; it's just not a great movie.",1133740800,4,2131,4.602631578947369

1969904,5,B00013RC2K,"This film deals with adolescent girls living in a lower middle class milieu where the fathers are absent.  Are we talking about dysfunctional families?  Indeed, we most certainly are.  Evie (Nikki Reed) is a hardened manipulator who may even be a remorseless sociopath.  She is already more than a bit slutty and a loser going nowhere fast.  The very concept of delayed gratification is utterly alien to her.  Getting high and shop lifting are preferable to acquiring an education.  The opposite is true for Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a shy girl who earns good grades.  Her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is divorced from a man who has opted for a solidly middle class life.  He has little time for either Tracy or her brother, Brady.  Evie is considered to be the most popular girl at school, and Tracy wants to join her inner circle.  Sadly, this goal is achieved and Tracy's life begins to rapidly fall apart.  The audience is in for a rough ride. Many of the scenes in Thirteen are not for the squeamish.  Watching a young girl cut into her arm with various sharp objects almost made me turn my head away from the screen.  Thirteen is highly recommended for all parents, teenagers, and anyone involved in helping teenagers grow into mature adults.

Why did it get an R rating?  This may be due to Holly Hunter's totally unnecessary and gratuitous nude scene.  What was director Catherine Hardwicke thinking?  Did the producers, for some bizarre reason, demand that this be done?  Oh well, Hardwicke still directed a first rate production.  She easily earns five stars for her efforts.  Nikki Reed is also credited with co-authoring the script.

1969905,5,B00013RC2K,"When I first caught this movie on cable I was flipping channels and the ambience immediately attracted me.  The use of dark colors is beautiful and gives you the feel of watching a home movie almost. The underlying emotion and attitude was so strong that I could tell right away that it was going to have a profound message.  I was compelled to watch it.

It was astonishing in its honesty.  So many things about both of the girls struck a chord with me.  I felt like I could relate completely in my own teenage experiences.

After a while I stopped relating and was suddenly terrified.  I'm not a teenager anymore.  These things are not ok.  They're dangerous and it scares the heck out of me that not only did I do some of these things, but as a parent, my own children could be doing these things... and they might not be as lucky or as smart as I was to get away from them.

What scares me even more about this film is that if I had seen it as a teenager I would have thought it was cool.  I might even have tried some of the things I hadn't already or been encouraged to do more of what I had.  I would not have the experience I have now to realize the severe emotional and physical reprecussions that engaging in these types of activity can cause.

The most inexplicable part is when she cuts herself, she doesn't seem to actually be depressed or have any reason it just seemed (as with the whole movie) like they were trying to capitalize on all of the possible bad things that a teenager could do and so decided to throw them all in one after another really unconvincingly.",1125792000,7,620,4.447368421052632

  Evan Rachel Wood became her character.  Nikki (Evie), the writer and one of the main characters is very talented but the girl worried me.  She was promiscuous, neglected, beautfiul, manipulative, charming and extremely dysfunctional. She takes Tracy (Wood) down her indulgent, gutter-of-teenage-life spiral into self-destruction. It is hard to watch, but harder not to watch.  It gives you a peek into what is happening to many middle and high schoolers especially the ones with broken hearts and homes and then left with no mentoring, correction or supervision.  Rebellion, sex and crime take over. Life is so different now (for my 7th grader) than it was for me 22 years ago.  Or maybe it isn't...maybe it just scares the ---- out of me now that I can only train and guide, and not totally control the life of my kid and other kid's lives.

While I will give it this, it does try to be different. It falls short into trying to "" shock"" an audience. The movie centers around a thirteen (hence the title) year old girl, who in the beggining is the cliche good girl but by the end, is the cliche bad girl. Who somehow, within 48 hours goes from being a kind sweet innocent girl, to stealing money from others. Which is a little unrealistic. Being 16 myself and knowing the negative effects of peer pressure (or atleast from a male point of view) I know it is though but to totally throw any morals you have so quickly seems ""odd"" to say the least. Being that her mom seems to have a drinking problem ( not to mention an attraction to younger white trash guys) doesn't help the problem. In fact, every adult in this movie seems to be oblivious to what their kids are doing. So, as the movie goes on, the girl's go on a downward spiral involving drugs, sex,  self mutilation alcohal and so on and so forth. Another thing I found hard to believe was, these girl's seem to act as today's 15, 16 and 17 year old girl's do. Not 13. However, the one scary realistic part of this movie is that, this could be how girl's that age in 5 or 10 years act if people don't start giving a s*it.

When I first saw this movie I rented it and I found it so good and interesting that I had to a buy it and show my parents and you should too. The movie explain's a young girl name Tracy who pretty much has a hard time with her life because of her parents split up and other things, so Tracy notices that she wants to have more fun and attention in her life so tries to impress the most popular girl in her school name Evie. But soon after you can tell that this girl has deep problems of her own but are never reveal in the movie which makes it more real. The main point of this film is the things the two girls go through which is shocking and intense that you have to watch it more then twice to truly understand each detail.

1969916,5,B00013RC2K,"You will not be able to leave this movie unaffected.  Do not ask me what prompted me to view this movie.  I do not have children, and I have not watched a teeny bopper movie in about 20 years.  I'm so glad I watched it though.  The message to this movie is the unspoken message.  First, let's get one fact out of the way: All parents love their children.  Also, all parents want to achieve the love of their children.  Holly Hunter displays an all too real 21st century parent who does what she can to achieve her child's love to her own fault.  In essence, this desire to have her child love her makes her weak.  She turns her head when her child comes home with lavish purchases.  She ignores the child's abberant behavior with the idea that the girl is a teen, and she fights with the child as one would a sibling. Hunter's character is weakened by a divorce and a past substance abuse problem, so she has given the child ammunition. The child, of course, attacks her mother's weaknesses, and the mother is wounded by these assaults.  This societal malady is portrayed with cringing credibility by Hunter.  Again, I understand that a parent wants their child to love them, and I can understand that the teen years can overwhelm a parent when faced with the shock and awe attack a teen will use on a parent to assert control.  I'm left with the thought, however, that a parent must endure these attacks with strength.  Allow the child to call you a hypocrite for your activities versus your teachings, allow them to swarm you with attacks on the weaknesses you display, then remain strong for them.  Many parents strive to be buddies with their kids, and they strive to avoid the mistakes that their parents made, but en route to these goals they forget the awesome responsibility of parenthood: to raise a moral and decent adult.  Anyone who is a parent of a teen should watch this movie as a harrowing example of what not to do.  I am awed by the fact that this movie was written by such a young person, because it is so comprehensive in its detail.  It is so comprehensive that it generated a response such as the one I just wrote for you. I will be keeping my eye open for this young person--this Evan Rachael Wood--to see if this was a one-time fluke based upon personal experience, or if she is really this good.  I believe it was Ernest Heminway who said, and I'm paraphrasing: ""Everyone has one good book (screenplay) in them, the trick is to have two.""",1122854400,2,2463,4.44543429844098
1969917,3,B00013RC2K,"I saw this movie and I was impressed w/the acting. But it stops right there. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, I mean the mother was a total pushover who let herself be manipulated by two thirteen year olds. Any single mother raising her kids in the inner-city or anywhere for that matter need to be more involved in their childrens lives. People keep saying this movie reflects how some kids really act, and that may be true but it reflects only a percentage of today's kids.  I give the movie 1 star for Jeremy Sisto because he is kind of handsome, 1 star for the general acting, and the final star because it was refreshing to see a film where the kids wildin out were White (or was Evie Hispanic???)For a while the media and films make it seem like all of the bad kids are Black, mixed, or Hispanic (e.g Boyz in the Hood, Menace II Society) . But the film shows that children of all cultures can succumb to drug abuse, early sex, manipulation, and fights, AND a parent's role is to be a parent not just a friend.",1122595200,,1027,4.266666666666667
1969918,4,B00013RC2K,"It is amazing.  I'm not talking about the film; I'm talking about the reaction to it.  Though 'Thirteen' collected only $4,600,000 on the US boxoffice chart, it got one Oscar nomination (for Holly Hunter) and two Golden Globe nominations (for Hunter and Wood) not to mention the more than 300 reviews sent here by visitors to amazon.  What does that mean?

Whatever it is, one thing is clear -- many people related to the central character, Tracy, played by Evan Rachel Wood.  And this is exactly the point, for while some claim that the film  is so real, others find it otherwise.  In other words, if you don't like the film's subject matter and the heroine, or just refuse to believe in the story, you might find the film self-indulgent and even empty.

Let's not talk about reality for now.  The film can be seen in two ways.  Part of it describes the two young girls Tracy and Evan (Nikki Reed, who contributed to the script), and how the friendship between Tracy and Evan ('The hottest girl in the school') developes to the shattering results.  Tracy wanted to be like gorgeous (so she thinks) Evan, but by so doing she experiences petty crimes, drugs, wrist cutting, and so on.  Interestingly, you would see no police or authority, which suggest the nature of the film -- it is not about the 'bad' behaviors of them; it's about the relations between the characters.

Another principal character is involved, and that is Tracy's mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter).  It is suggested that she experienced divorce and booze in the past, and her new friend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) is coming out of some insitute, to live with Melanie and her children.  As Evan also moves in her house, the relations between the daughter and mother gets more turbulant.  And Melanie's ex-husband is away from them, unreliable when they need help.

OK, good thing about the film is the acting, which is probably better than the underwritten script itself.  Though Holly Hunter is top-credited, Evan Rachel Wood is the real protagonist, and she almost single-handedly carries the whole film till the end.  Equally good is Nikki Reed and Jeremy Sisto, and you get supports from Kipp Pardue and Deborah Kara Unger.  Well, however, though I readily admit the good quality of the acting, including that of Hunter (who is very painful to watch), I was not impressed with the film itself, and the here is the reason.

DIRECTOR CATHERINE HARDWICKE is formerly known as production designer (see her excellent works in 'Anti-Trust'), this is her first works as director.  She is also the co-writer of the script, which I find very unsatisfactory.  Many things are left unexplained, some of which are integral to the film -- but I can ignore them.  Still, I really hate it when the estranged father appears before his daughter, and when he tries to talk to her, his cellphone starts to ring, a call from his business partner or something, implying he is too busy to be with her.  I also really hate it when a divorced mother, while inviting her boyfriend to her house, is too self-occupied to notice the obvious changes in her daughter.  I'm not saying this is not real.  This is typical cliched moments found in many Hollywood movies, which have been repeated again and again.

Then we come back to the point where we started -- Is this real?  To some people, it is (read Drew Barrymore's book 'Little Girl Lost' which is more realistic).  And to the other kind of people, 'Thirteen' may -- just 'may' -- be a convincing protrait of teenager's life in America thanks to Wood and Reed.  Whichever category you fall into, you will be throughly enthrolled by the acting -- even though it is about  the extremely anguished heart.",1122336000,2,3691,4.727699530516432
1969919,3,B00013RC2K,"I remember hearing about this movie when it first came out and reading an interview with the creator Nikki Reed. I thought it sounded stupid and melodramatic, so I avoided it. 'Sex, drugs, and catfights!' the headline had read. So a couple years later I decided what the heck, I'll rent it away. I knew it was going to be depressing and dramatic and I was right. It was. It was pretty realistic, yes this stuff does happen to *gasp* even thirteen year-olds, I've seen it with my own two eyes. But the thing is, the thirteen year-olds who are doing this don't even represent half the population of young teens. Most young teens don't act like this, it's only a few groups. So I just wanted to point that out to some people, and settle a compromise between the people who say 'it never happens' and the people who say 'this is completely normal for any young teen'. Anyway on to the movie. The shooting is pretty much low-budget, but that's what you'd expect from an indie film. Not a problem, if you're a fan of indie movies you should be used to this. My only problem with the story was in the beginning, where she becomes friends with Evie. One day Evie and her friend insult her, and the next day all Tracy has to do is wear cool clothes and suddenly Evie lets her hang out with her? It didn't seem very realistic, like the beginning of Evie and Tracy's relationship didn't seem developed enough in the beginning. And another thing I thought was weird with the movie: the two girls were always hanging out with 'bad' guys and all these 'bad' guys just happened to be black. A little weird, isn't that kind of a negative sterotype? It was like they were at a 'ghetto' school yet there wasn't even any black females or white guys, it was all just black guys and white girls. I don't know that part didn't seem realistic, like the director wanted some ethnic diversity but she didn't show it in a very realistic manner. Other than that, the movie wasn't too bad. If you enjoy the bad girl spiralling out-of-control movies like 'Girl, Interrupted' then this movie is for you.",1121472000,12,2073,4.457894736842105
1969920,5,B00013RC2K,"Dang. What a movie. Despite the great acting, Not very pleasant to watch especially if you have kids this age, and these days are tough to grow up in at this age. Back in the day yes it was common for parents to worry about peer pressure, teen pregnancy, drugs, and the ""wrong"" crowd, and those worries will always be a reality, and the wrong men flock to teenage girls. I remember being 14 and perverted 23 year olds up to 28 year olds tried to ""get"" with me. And now more worries include body peircings, tattoo's, and it's very easy to get without parents knowing, as in this movie all the girl had to do was seduce the tatoo guy, and it's sick but also very true. You'd be surprised how many guys are attracted to very very young girls, and sometimes teens appear to look older, like in this movie, the brunette did not look 14. That is why my mom never let me wear makeup at that age. I can understand why. But the blonde girl looks SO SO young, any guy who'd wanna hook up with someone that young needs to be in jail. This movie may be a little bit of an exageration, but i'm not sure if you've ever seen actual ""out of control"" teens, watch the maury show and see what i mean. It's sad, and the mothers give up on discipline, like the mother in this movie holly hunter i believe she was too passive, and wasn't paying enough attention to her daughter's life and friends. There is no such thing as discipline not working. You can always find a way to get your kid's life straightened out. I think too many parents give up easily, and they tell themselves, i can't stop her. YOU CAN! one thing worked for me, was taking my phone away. That means no communication. Sneaking out, have the cops pick her up believe me one night in juvee will make her cry back into your arms. It's very sad that kids end up dead or pregnant or with std's, but those things can be prevented, if you're committed to your child, and you have the right techinques, and you actually love your kid.

This movie is harrowing and nasty but incredibly realistic and true to real life. Both girls and guys alike struggle through adolesence, especially when their parents give them little or no direction. With that being said the movie itself was pretty powerful and I thought well acted Evan Rachel Wood (Tracy) and Nikki Reed did a remarkable job of portraying dirty, trashy and down right slutty teenagers, and Holly Hunter did a great job of playing a confused mother who refused to take charge of her daughter's behavior.

I, myself am a 21 year old guy that is not a parent but see this behavior quite often from teenagers that just want to belong to something and crave attention. I'm guessing the moral of this story is for parents to give their children the attention they desire and crave so they don't go looking for it in other ways that could damage their life.

For those who refuse to believe this is realistic need to open your eyes because it could be your son or daughter acting this way without you realizing it. A great movie!",1119225600,5,1258,4.4847161572052405
1969923,3,B00013RC2K,"I'm sorry to say that the answer is ""NO"" Hillary Clinton. A community cannot raise kids. The ultimate responsibility for doing that is a parent. Here we have Holly Hunter as a single mother trying to raise her children in low-income enviroment as a hair stylist. Her teenage daughter feels violated, alienated, and pushed aside because of all that. The father is wrapped up in his own life, and can't get past to help his daughter. The teenage girl Tracy is trying to fit in in junior high school, and is desparate to please a girl named Evie, so what would start out as a transformation of clothing wardrobe Tracy has Evie's attention, or is it the other way around? The story of these 2 girls is so intertwinded for the most part that it's hard to figure out whose trying to please who? There are things about Tracy that Evie wants to have like a mother as Evie wants to be adopted by Tracy's mom, and Tracy because Evie's the most popular girl in school. Back in the days when I was in junior high it was just starting to get worse; There were knives, and marijuana, and cigarettes in my junior high, whereas now it's cellular phones, cigarettes, guns, knives, all kinds of drugs in junior high. Anyway Evie exposes Tracy to the so-called glamourous side of junior high as Tracy sells out her values and friends for this girl, and in turn Evie is selling herself onto Tracy to be like not only a soul sister to Tracy, but maybe a soul-mate as Evie and Tracy share just about everything with each other. However, it's not meant to be as it's brought out that Evie already has a mother who's one of Tracy's mom's clients, and Tracy's mom refuses to adopt Evie, and so Evie makes it hard for Tracy even to the point of making it seem like it was Tracy who exposed Evie to the world of drugs, sex, and self-multilation. It made my heart break to see girls doing stuff like that because of the stresses, the heartbreaks, and crap that life dishes out alot of the time. I found this to be too stark and realistic of a movie. Evie and Tracy were beautiful girls who just had circumstances where they felt love wasn't enough. In the end it was Tracy who was shown how much she was loved as her mom saw the multilations that Tracy made on her arms, and her mom kissed them all while Tracy was crying because of Evie's betrayal. This movie represented life at it's ultimate worst. Divorce, drugs, helplessness, inability to try and better yourself in education, self-infliction of pain, sex, and anything under the sun to make the pain go away. Pain doesn't necessarily go away, but if you have the love and support of both parents even if they aren't married anymore a child won't have to look for the community to give to him/her to get need and want. Let's leave the job of raising children to the parents, and the community support the parents .

As the voice of a recent teenager, Thirteen's blatant coverage of almost every possible problem teenage girls can face in the tumultuous face of adolescence may shock, appall, and frighten many parents, but the unfortunate truth is that one of Thirteen's greatest appeals (for lack of a better word) is its' haunting realism. Although Tracy, who is just as pretty, popular, and smart as the slightly above average, clean faced thirteen year old girl is expected to be in most cinema portrayals at the beginning of the film, her introduction into the hardcore underbelly of L.A sex, drugs, and a general loss of innocence causes her to become even more out of control than her initial mentor, Evie. You're infuriated by Tracy's furious need to be accepted (played stunningly by Evan Rachel Wood) and at the same time, you look at her from your invisible movie window with a mixed glance of fear and pity. The movie isn't quite enough to make you burst into tragic tears (because the story doesn't really reverberate as your typical boo-hoo tragedy) but it is enough to make you want to grab an adolescent your close to and give them a giant hug; the story's underlying fact that a world so scary and large can come crashing down around a 7th grade girl is a perfect immortalization of just how much harder it is to be a teenager today than one could determine from one glance or your average spoofy teen soap opera.",1110067200,2,1644,4.610921501706485

1969936,4,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" falls in a category I like to call ""Teens gone wild."" Why not create such a rubric? We've got videos showing animals on rampages, college girls on rampages, and shows with adults behaving badly. I even saw part of a program recently that deals with troubled toddlers. I have yet to see, however, any shows dealing with snarky senior citizens. Anyway, ""Teens gone wild"" has seen a surge of movies, documentaries, and assorted television programs in recent years. Larry Clark's ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" helped kick off the craze. ""Fun"" is another movie to rent if you want to see adolescents committing crimes and generally acting like psychopaths. Nearly any program on the Lifetime network dealing with kids falls into this category, and occasionally you'll see a documentary on public television dealing with the shoddy moral standards of America's youth. Come to think of it, we really don't need to watch media programs about bad kids when merely opening your daily newspaper will reveal story after story involving crime, drugs, and teenagers. It's sad, really, but just another symptom of a society slipping rapidly into the dark pit of anarchy. Even sadder are the people, including parents, who wring their hands over the latest atrocities yet do nothing to stop it from happening again.

Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a beautiful young girl who lives in a rather chaotic environment. Her mother Melanie (Holly Hunter) is a recovering alcoholic raising Tracy and her brother Mason (Brady Corbet) with little assistance from their father. In the beginning of the film we get a few glimpses of Tracy's character and learn that she has a dark side. A poem she writes and reads for her mother is filled with doom and gloom. Too, this young girl cuts herself with a razorblade whenever stress overwhelms her. Most of this stress seems to arise from school, where Tracy's intelligence and work ethic translates into geek status. She longs to hang out with the popular crowd, which in this case means the clique headed up by the vivacious Evie (Nikki Reed). Actually, ""vivacious"" probably isn't the correct term to apply to Evie--she's certainly an attractive young lady with an outgoing personality, but her attire and her manner reek of decadence. An opportunity for Tracy to transcend her social status arrives on the heels of a snub. Evie and a friend spurn Tracy's attempts to form a relationship at a local department store, so our girl promptly steals a lady's wallet outside and returns flush with cash. The girls go on a spending spree, and from this point on Tracy and Evie are inseparable.

In no time at all Evie practically moves in with her new friend and begins running the show. Both girls start using all sorts of drugs, drink heavily, sneak out at night, hang out with older guys for bouts of you know what, cut class, steal, and engage in other delinquent behaviors. Melanie at first accepts Evie into her household mainly because she has little reason for apprehension and partly because she wants her daughter to be happy. Besides, Melanie has her own problems to contend with, including struggling with her own sobriety even as she takes into her arms a man named Brady (Jeremy Sisto) whose substance abuse problems occasionally surface from time to time. Any concerns Melanie has about Evie fall by the wayside when the girl tells her that she's a victim of child abuse. Evie is a real schemer, and her influence over Tracy and everyone else around her is so total that it's not long before Melanie and her daughter engage in extended screaming matches over a variety of issues. No kid can indulge in these sorts of behaviors while living at home and expect to keep everything under wraps forever, and such is the case with Tracy. Will Tracy survive? Will she ever return to something resembling normalcy? The conclusion to ""Thirteen"" is slightly enigmatic and offers few concrete answers to these questions.

""Thirteen"" is often a traumatic movie to watch. Seeing kids of such tender years take part in sordid activities isn't the sort of thing most people like to witness, and the film pulls few punches in its portrayal of such activities. It's sufficient to say that the sorts of things kids deal with today are quite different from the things kids dealt with even ten to fifteen years ago. The movie doesn't spend much time trying to place blame or offer solutions, unfortunately, but instead goes for a value neutral character study. I can't say I agree with this approach, but I do find much to like about the actors playing these individuals. Holly Hunter, a woman who simply looks better and better the older she gets, does a great job playing the put upon Melanie. She goes through stages of depression, despair, anger, and denial while trying to deal with her wayward daughter, and does so convincingly. Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed bring a lot to their respective parts, both tearing up the screen as teens wildly and shockingly out of control. Jeremy Sisto is a promising actor currently building up his filmography, but he doesn't get much to do here.

Extras on the ""Thirteen"" disc include a behind the scenes look at the film, a trailer, deleted scenes, and a commentary track. Realistic, raw, unnerving, and likely destined to become some sort of cult classic, ""Thirteen"" is a worthy addition to the ""Teens gone wild"" canon I spoke of earlier. I liked this movie because it dealt with a side of adolescence I knew little to nothing about when I was a similar age, namely what it's like to be a teenage girl. After watching this film, though, I can safely say I'm happy I don't have kids.",1108080000,3,5633,4.816115702479339

I am 15, and I can say that this is incredibly REAL. I am not involved with any of the things portrayed in the film and I try to avoid people who are, but peer-pressure is a daily battle every teenage has to deal with. Anyone could fall into a horrible lifestyle like that, and it was outstanding how well Hardwicke displayed this. Very depressing but definitely worth watching.",1106956800,4,513,4.244897959183674
1969938,1,B00013RC2K,"That is how I describe this movie. I know what this movie is supposed to be. It's supposedly a shocking, accurate portrayl of teenage life. That's what the movie tries to be. It's actually worse than an after school special. It's not real at all. Girls that look like Tracey do not have popularity issues. Tracey had friends. It makes no sense that she'd want to start hanging out with a new crowd. Tracey's father might not be around most of the time,  but she has a brother and a mother. She wasn't abused. She wasn't neglected. I don't buy that she's a cutter. It was so lame. Cutting is a serious thing. This movie acts like kids cut when they have a bad day at school. An episode of the acclaimed teen series Degrassi did a much better job with the issue of cutting. There is no reason for her character to do the things she does in the movie. I did not feel anything for any of the characters in the movie because they didn't seem real. There was no reason for them to act the way that they did with the exception of Evie. She had a hard life. I can see why she'd act out. Stil, Evie's actions were puzzling at times also. Why would she turn on her friend in the end? It made no sense to me. If people want to see a shocking, eye opening movie about troubled teens, they should see the movie Kids. That was sad, but great movie. Avoid this wannabe movie.",1106870400,8,1360,4.190839694656488
1969939,5,B00013RC2K,"If you're a little like me and saw Evan Rachel Wood in 'Simone', and maybe two 'Once and Again' episodes, and then later in Ron's Howard's 'The Missing', and you wonder where she got so grown up you will find the answers in 'Thirteen'.

'Thirteen' is a movie I have wanting to see ever since I first heard about it on a group dedicated to Evan's films on Yahoo! Evan-Rachel-Wood@yahoogroups.com, which I first joined when I heard she was part of 'The Missing' cast. I first thought 'Thirteen' was a movie already out on DVD. Then I found it hadn't been released in Australia at the cinemas.

When it was released at the cinemas in Australia it was only at
selected cinemas. One that wasn't exactly five minutes away but a
cinema I always tried to get to each week. Finally I got to one of the cinemas it was playing at, and found it had just finished being
shown at that cinema. Instead my twin brother Stephen and I went and saw 'Monster'. That was an excellent movie. I'm glad I saw it. So I waited for 'Thirteen' on DVD.

This movie was shot in twenty seven days, and on a cheap budget. All but two of the shots are hand held. Steven Spielberg's film 'Catch Me If You Can', was also shot in twenty seven days.

One of the images I thought was so effective is of Evan and Nikki
Reed sticking their tongues out showing off their tongue rings. I
really like it to try and sell this movie.

The music is also great. Some tracks I enjoy on the CD and in the
film, in no special order are Katy Rose - 'Lemon', Clinic - 'The
Equaliser', Liz Phair 'Head Underwater'. Mark Mothersbaugh - Score -'The Shoot Out', Mark Mothersbaugh ''Hit Me' and Folk Implosion - 'Make It With The Best'.

I also love the dull colour pallet in some of the scenes. It is
really appropriate. Another film I really love with a slightly blue tinge colour to it is 'Crazy/Beautiful' with Kirsten Dunst. Another with a blue colour change is 'Underworld'. I think colour changes infilm will continue to make films that little bit different then therest and more interesting. 'Man On Fire' is another with film colour issues. Although I didn't like that film so much.

'Thirteen's tagline 'They're not little girls anymore' is great. I also think 'Filmink's comment ""...an emotional firebomb..."" Totally compelling"" is exactly right.

'Thirteen' is rated MA 15+ for adult themes, drug use.

This is not always an easy movie to watch. When Evan's character
Tracy cuts her wrists on several occasions during the film I think Evan was just so brave to do this movie. Evan is a great girl I imagine, and it is hard to watch someone inflict what would be excruciating pain on themselves. I'm glad the tongue rings and bellybutton rings were not real. More painful procedures I'm sure. I'd never want a tongue ring or want to slit my wrists. I don't know how Evan did those scenes.

I like how it ends because her troubles are only just starting. She has a long way to go yet. It's a little sad at the same time.
Spoiling one's body, and having to deal with major issues so young. I wouldn't want a sequel to this movie but if there was one maybe it could be 'Fourteen'.

I wouldn't want to be Thirteen again. That's for sure, even though my year was quite good it's still hard for anyone.

I am really glad I own this film. It seems very real to me. In a
strange way it is now one of my favorite movies. I like to watch
teenage related films, and new up-and-comers. I never really used to. It has just evolved. I think teenage films would make for an interesting article one day. 'Mean Girls' is another favorite movie of mine recently. But when it comes to Evan 'Thirteen' will remain a favorite along with 'The Missing'.",1106784000,,3684,4.425406203840472
1969940,4,B00013RC2K,"I entered junior high school, graduated from high school, began college and ""came of age"" in the 1990s, and the reason this movie struck so close to home for my sister and I is because we knew people in real life that mirrored the characters in the movie.  The bitchy sluts, the boys overdosed on testosterone, the slit-my-wrists-and-rub-the-blood-on-the-wall kids (boys and girls alike) and, most of all, the Parents That Didn't Give a Damn.

The performances in this movie are first-rate and sometimes you might think you're watching a documentary.  But ... the problem is the characters in the movie don't seem to be ""characters"" as much as they seem to be points-of-view.  On the surface everything is golden, but there's not much below and no emotional center.  Just events occurring and people reacting.

For example, Evan Rachel Wood likes to slit her wrists for whatever reason, but we never REALLY find out why.  We just ASSUME it's because her world is ""spinning out of control.""

The ""spinning out of control"" part brings me to my next point.  I, like other reviewers, had trouble sympathizing with ANYONE in the movie.  Some view this movie as a lesson on how tough it is to be a teenager, and/or how tough it is to be a parent.  But after seeing it myself and looking back on my time in school in the 90s ... it's a lesson on how people are afraid of--and shy away from--life's responsibilities, adults and their children alike.

Evan Rachel Wood's character had everything a spoiled thirteen-year-old could want, save that fancy pair of jeans, and Holly Hunter's character didn't wanna find a real job.  Do they really deserve sympathy?

one day i watched it again and it made me burst into tears, as i thought about me and all my friends, as it seems we're all going down the same road as Evie and Tracy.

why didn't i enjoy it the first? well isn't that obvious i wasn't mature enough to watch the movie, i couldn't empathise with the charchters to find it emotional enough, as that is what the film is really all about EMOTIOM!!!

what i really enjoyed about this film is that it showes what really happens as a teen, when you dicover drink drugs and sex!!

and it doesnt show them as having a blast, it shows how dark it can realy be, that sometimes what s on the outside is just ski, not who a person really is!!!

this film shows teens as real as it can be, although the 18 certificate is so you can protect kids from the whole sex, drugs and rock n roll attitude ut gives off, its just kids probaly won't enjoy the film untill theyv experinced loif enough to see whats rally going on.

i have only one critism of this film is that Tracy and Evie don't really look thirttenn more like 15, but that doesnt change anything about the fil.

full of nail biting emotion, and is a real teer jerker. keep the tissies near by. show s a real insight to the teen world, that should be seen by both adults and teens all over. THIS FILM ROCKS",1105574400,5,1612,4.1309904153354635

This movie is just an invitation for kids to behave that badly. Peer pressure is just a copout for not wanting to be brave enough to be yourself. IMHO.",1104624000,12,552,4.073394495412844

I know alot of girls in my grade who are exactly like Tracey and Evie. All of the popular people in my school. They get toungue rings, belly button rings, they smoke practically anything they can get their hands on,they cut themselves,steal things,they have sex alot. It's amazing how similar tracey and evie are alike to girls around 13, 14 and 15 these days. Believe it or not but,a good amount of girls the age of 13 do all of these things. Trust me, I would know. I was just thirteen last year. And I knew alot of girls that were doing all of this. Even more now. So I think that this movie is really good because it shows all of the girls how it may seem fun and everything now, but in the long run, it's not worth it at all. And what it will do to you. I believe that this movie actually could help stop teenagers from doing these kind of things. Because they don't ever really SEE what it does to you. They just hear ""It will kill brain cells,it can cause heart problems.."" Kids don't wanna listen to that. The health affects. I think all of you who are reading this get my point.

I'm 23 years old, and at the time when I was 13 my mom did what she had to do to keep me in line. I was running around with kids that I look back at now, and wonder what I ever liked about them.

But lets be real here...we all got punished when we were kids, and look how we turned out. The little girl in this movie is running around wearing thongs?? Are you kidding me? Who does her little a** think is going to see them? When I was 13 I was wearing granny panties..Which I might add are way more comfy then thongs.

To all of those that describe how unrealistic it is, guess again. Those are the opinions of 40 year olds that are out of touch. All of the events that occur in the movie are painfully realistic. My high school is filled with cutters and suicidal teens. When I was in the 7th grade, there was a group of about 7 girls that lost there virginity that year. My 7th grade year was the year that drugs were introduced. It started with pot, but then came the crank, coke, heroin, acid, x, etc.

Although the content is accurate as far as the usage of drugs, sex, and masochism, the film does not shed any new light on the matter.  There is a lack of intellectual meat (symbolism, metaphors, motifs) that would give the plot more meaning.

The characters are not developed in a way that is interesting and it is unclear how each one feels about the other in a non-superficial/overly emotional manner.  The two main characters lack substance and exemplify why the film is so horrible.  Evie makes a humorous attempt to illustrate the ""bad girl"" .  Somehow all her ""shocking"" actions happen to be predictable.  Tracy is a stereotypical A student who quickly becomes a slut, thief, drug user, and cutter- a radical change that is counterproductive for the viewer...

The camera work is an attempt to be artistic and independent, but does the opposite.  The imagery is nauseating and not aesthetically pleasing in the least.  The film stock is mundane and the camera shots are complacent with traditional cinema.

I've never done more than pot, but even then the drug issue hit close to home when I was thirteen. I've had 4 of my best friends nearly overdose on heroin, and cocain. They were all related so they all got into it and each were no older than fourteen.

As for the cutting issue. I've been battling the same problem since I was thirteen, another home run back to my stadium. It never just evolves from no where, one day you just feel like you have nothing else to help yourself but to bleed to see if you're alive. I NEVER endorse it, nor does this movie. She cries with no visable tears because she's crying so hard, ever had that happen, when you cry so hard your eyes cry dry tears? I have. It's hard, and I'm still in battle with myself. This movie represents a lot of things in my life that I feel for.

The sex, I've never gotten that far, because I've had very bad issues with it all too. All I'm trying to say is this well acted and written movie is VERY realistic, not garbage as most of you are saying. It made me cry more than I've ever cried at the end of a movie, and all I could do was hold onto my friend and cry on her shoulder, wishing my mom would save me in her arms like her mom did in the movie (I can't remember the names).

Quick, jerky camera movements, the use of black and white, all help give the viewer this sense of confusion which really helps set the viewer to experience the chaotic life that the main character is going through.

Some say this movie is unrealistic, personally living through that crap hole known as highschool, I can safely say that this movie is spot on when it comes to describing certain kids.  The movie is about fitting in, and the lengths some insecure individuals will go through to achieve this level of acceptance.  This film really relates to me, because I have a lot of female friends that went through, or are still going through similar experiences, in particular the self mutilation, and the need for acceptance.

Yes, this movie is one hell of a rollercoaster of a ride, but don't expect it to let up so you can catch your breath.  It won't, and it can be very depressing, especially the way the movie ends.  Reminds me of film noir, where everything doesn't ALWAYS end all happy and nice.

The only nudity in the film is of the mother, and it's completely non-sexual. (She's in the shower)

There's definitely some significant drug use in the movie. Tracy and Evie get high, they drink, and later on, they're shown snorting something. I have to mention, however, that none of this stuff is glorified at any time in the movie.

This movie was written by Nikki Reed when she was thirteen. This movie shows many of the things that a thirteen year old can/will face. Reed accurately showed the different froms of peer pressure that teenagers face and the struggle to fit in and make a place for yourself.

This movie starts out with Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a 7th grader with a very close realtionship with her mother (Holly Hunter), who is starting her first day in 7th grade. She realizes that she isn't the most popular person. She decides to try and become friends with Evie (Nikki Reed). So she decides to steal a womans walet, and in doing so, creates a close relationship between Evie and herself.

Tracys entire attitude toward her family and her life get thrown of course as she falls into a downward spiral of sex, drugs, and booze. Her concerned brother (Brady Corbet) tries to help her but she doesn't bother listening. And finnaly, as she spirals deeper and deeper out of control, her mother decides to take control.

Reed's movie should be seen by everyone from parents to teenagers. It correctly shows how the decisions that you make affect you and those around you.",1101686400,3,1311,4.495798319327731

I already had seen some of the scenes and saw ""Evie"" (co-writer and actress in the movie) on Oprah for a special the subject matter in Thirteen.  I was a 13-year-old.  And a 15-year-old.  And a 17-year-old.  etc.  And let me tell you, I can believe this movie for its reality more than I can for its shock value.  My husband, on the other hand, was mortified.  We don't have kids yet, and so the first thing out of his mouth was, ""we're not having a girl, no way, NO WAY!""  I know what happened in this movie stems a lot more from the characters' situations than just choice, but it's still scary because it can happen regardless of how you're raised.

I think parents should watch this and maybe even watch it with their kids if everyone can handle the embarrassment.  There is a lot to talk about and a lot to explain.  Like how the main character cut herself -- my poor hubby just didn't get it.  The first time it happened, he said, ""what's she doing"" and I said very matter of factly (and no, I've never cut myself), ""she's cutting herself.""  He just didn't get it.  It happens again, and he said the same thing.  For him, the idea of inflicting pain like that was extremely bothersome and just didn't make sense at all.  For me, there's a basic explanation albeit one I don't personally fully understand.

My only critique about the movie is that the timing seems to move and slow down as needed, and that almost everything a teenager could go through happened in this movie (hints of an eating disorder, cutting, drugs, alcohol, anger, depression, sex...etc.).  I'm sure all of them could be one person's experience, but I would have felt it more realistic to just stick to a few things, not everything.

  As a 16 year old female, i can relate to the problems the protagonist encountered and the actress was very convincing. But, i feel that 13 is just an age thats really too young. Im aware that these kind of things do happen to some 13 year olds, but it would be far more realistic if the character were slightly older, seeing as the actresses look much older than 13 anyway! I also feel that it moved very quickly and was a little OTT. I really don't see how quickly tracy gets screwed up and ive never seen someone change so much to fit in. It also seems that Tracy gets almost too many problems, i mean self harming,drug taking, general crime, self prostitution and an apparant eating disorder in such a small space of time??? For a teenager who has had my share of problems, i feel that all of that is a bit unrealistic. I would also consider showing it to people younger than 18, as  many teens have seen worse in horror films and it could be used as a way to tackle and discuss both emotional and social problems.

  In conclusion  i think that thirteen is a good movie which demonstrates many tramatic experiences teenages go through, which in turn may help raise awareness, but is slightly ott. I would recommend this movie to all.",1101427200,,1510,4.465454545454546
1969957,4,B00013RC2K,"Ok, first, I want to acknowledge that there is a lot being said about none of these people looking thirteen, so I checked it out.  Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed were both pretty darn close when the film was made.  Makeup and clothes can change a lot about how old a girl looks.

This movie is co-written by Nikki Reed as a partial autobiography of herself as a thirteen year old.  It is melodramatic, but not without reason.

I called this film controversial because though it sends a strong message about growing up and making choices, some parents are using it as shock treatment for their kids as a sort of, ""You think you've got it bad?  This could be your life,"" type of message.  I have known more than one parent who has exposed their young kid to this movie and it has resulted in them thinking it is normal and ok to cut themselves and to do their own major piercings.  So if you are a parent, think twice about letting your kid watch this movie.

I disagree with the people who say this film isn't shocking because, for me at least, it was.  Maybe I'm just lucky enough to have grown up in a ""normal"" household and not ever be exposed to this kind of a childhood.  Regardless, I say to those sitting down to watch this movie, prepare to be shocked and a little disturbed.",1101427200,,1283,4.304166666666666

  If some scenes in the movie did shock you, its because the things that they did were pretty bad, but not because the writers were just trying to convince everybody how awful it is to be a teenager.

  And in defence of the mother, its difficult for someone to get involved even if they know something is wrong. It's easy to say ""Oh, she should of done this"" or "" Well, obviously she has to do something"" but in a real situation very few people would actually act differntly. The mother was afraid to admit to herself what her daughter was doing, and once she did, she was afraid that she would end up pushing her farther away.

  I think that rather than this movie trying to shock people, it just did naturally because its a shocking subject.",1100995200,2,929,4.385964912280702

Ok I'll make it short and sweet for you

1. The girls do not even look thirteen and if they acctually did get 13 year old girls it would have bin a bit better

2. The movie was something I've seen on an educational video which is sadly...better.

3. What the hell was up with the mom?..I agree with the reviewer who was talking about the mom.

4. The movie just wasn't that great especially how much great reviews I heard about it .....99% prolly says A die hard movie fan who loved this will probably say something negative about my opinion...but hey it's my opinion....

1969960,4,B00013RC2K,"I really don't see why everybody is getting so angry at this movie. It may be because they are so ignorant as to believe that this stuff ""doesn't happen in real life"" or that this is way ""overacted."" I'm not pin-pointing anybody - I've been reading those very statements over and over again.

Where this movie excels in must is definetly in the actual acting. I was totally apalled (in a good way) with Reed's and Wood's amazing performences as two troubled teenage girls. I can see why many people would get upset over the mother's reaction to her daughter's sudden transformation but believe it or not, *that's what really happens.* How do I know? Well, I've been through this very experiance (not necessarily through the parent's stand point, mind you). How else is a parent supposed to act when one minute, she's her daughter's best friend and then all off a sudden, her daughter is mimicking styles only street walkers would be caught wearing (or just really rebellious girls). It's this kind of shocking behavior that can really catch a mother off guard.

Now my favorite part of the movie. The actual real-ness of it all, that place where people are totally in denial over. I can't tell you how many people I've talked to who just can't believe the behavior of these two young girls. Well, get over it. Because what you see in this movie (and, oh my god, believe it or not) IS TOTALLY REAL. I really can't see why people are so shocked by it all. What you see is real -  girls sneaking out of movie theaters, have threesomes with boys and snorting up coke. It's this kind of behavior that people see all the time in high school. Shocking? I don't think so.

I really do have to give it to Nikki Reed for her coureagous act to actually write this script. For many of you who don't know, Nikki Reed, one of the co-writers, based the main character (played by Wood), on the true life of herself before finally getting help. There. Now do you believe me?",1099612800,4,1957,4.504225352112676
1969961,2,B00013RC2K,"The Biggest problem in this movie is by far the mother of this girl (Holly Hunter).  She obviously loves her daughter but she fails throughout the whole movie with exception with the last 5 minutes to get involved in this girls life.  Maybe I went to take a leak or something but there seems to be something wrong with the mother that is never explained.  I don't know if the mother was dipping into her lovers' stash or what but she just seemed out of it the whole movie.  For some reason the mother doesn't stand up to the kid whenever she talks back, uses foul language, or comes busting in the house unquestionably high as hell.  When this girl was talking back and getting in her mother's face the mother should have taught the girl the other use for a belt besides to keep your pants up.  The complete lack of discipline was appalling.  Not only should the mother have given that girl an ass whopping with a belt but also are we to believe that she couldn't tell really early on that the other girl was a horrible influence on her own kid?  Isn't this girls' mother a little curious what this girl is doing in her house all the freaking time.  She never notices the tongue ring and that her daughter is walking around in all new clothes that she didn't finance.  I find this character the hardest to believe out of them all.  It would have been one thing to put the character on crack so we would expect the kind of complete lack of involvement.  Not to mention that she does hair out of her house for a living which rules out that poor single mommy is working all the time and never home excuse.

I have to say that while I do agree that the things that happened in this movie are realistic there seems to be a few things that make it a little hard to believe besides the mother.  One of the problems is with the girls' age, she is thirteen and acts and deals with typical situations faced by a teenager much older then thirteen (of course, there can be exceptions to this so we will let this one slide).  The next problem, which makes this movie seem very unrealistic, is when we see these girls going around and ""messing"" with the black guys.  We all know black guys love them some pinkness but we all know that more often then not you see the black guy messing around with some fatty not the skinny super hot and popular white girls.  (Ok sorry that was just a joke).  The next real thing that was troublesome is when this girl starts seemingly out of nowhere to cut herself.  Must of went to take a leak again I guess but out of the blue this starts happening, again not fully explained but I suppose we are to assume it is because of her parents being separated.  Boo Freaking Hoo some kids have to deal with problems that are a lot worse than that and they aren't doing these things to themselves.  The fact that this happens right after she makes buddy buddy with the bad chick makes it harder to believe.  I would except if something tragic just happened but nothing did.

Many people are reviewing this film talking about how important of a movie it is.  The truth of it all is that it is just another movie.  There is nothing important in the movie that we didn't already know.  Kids try drugs; have sex, blah blah blah.  None of this information is new.  Possibly the only new information is that when girls are inhaling whatever the hell they were inhaling that they punch each other in the face for fun afterwards.  There is a reason why you never see movies that were written by thirteen year olds, because they suck.  Ok that was a bit harsh I suppose.  The truth of it all is that there seems to be a good outline for a movie here but it just lacks a core.  It isn't filled in with enough specifics and information to make it a powerful movie.  It was a good idea to use females and see their perspective.  If this movie were about males then they would just get high, eat cheesy poofs, and strike out a lot with chicks.  If the movie dealt with less issues that were more in depth instead of making this girl some sort of super nut job with one problem after another it would have been a lot more believable and maybe there would have been enough time to explain to us why the things were happening to the girl instead of just making it a guess.",1099526400,4,4269,4.273972602739726

When Evie befriends Tracey she leads her down a path of sex, drugs and more. Tracey completly goes off the rails and leaves behind her clean-cut world, cutting off her old friends and also her mother (Holly Hunter). The film is a realistic portrayal of what some 13 year olds go through, i cant really say i did any of these things when i was 13, but it still does happen. Woods portrayal of the student trying to fit in is completely beliveveable, raw and emotional, she does a superb job. Hunter also does well as Wood's mother, trying her hardest to help her out of control daughter.

I wasn't trying to say that it was wrong and this doesn't happen, I just meant to say that it's not as glamorous as it seems in this movie. If a thirteen year watches this without parental supervision, most likely, they will want to become this. And as I remember correctly, me and my friends never thought these girls were so popular and had lives to be envied....we thought they were sluts. And sluts they were. I mean, trying to seduce and sleep with the ugly neighbor guy? Oh PUH-LEASE. As said many times before, it's very hard to feel sympathy for Tracy because in the end she should have known that Evie was going to set her up, that all the signs were there. The thing that makes me hate...no despise this movie is the fact that the mother did NOTHING. If that were my daughter I would have knocked the living snot right out of her. So, my serious opinion?

1969966,4,B00013RC2K,"This film and the film ""United States of Leland"" are both about contemporary adolescence, dysfunctional families, drug use, sex, petty larceny and murder in modern America.  I find it hard to believe that a 13-year-old could pen an award-winning script, but certainly it might be more realistic than one written by an adult, and this is what we are asked to believe about ""Thirteen,"" which garnered many more awards than ""Leland"".  In fact, ""Leland"" was rather soundly criticized by critics, mostly for not giving a thorough enough explanation for that film's sociopathic murder.  I found the two films to be nearly equally entertaining, and they also resemble a third film ""Elephant"".

.

""Thirteen"" has excellent cinematography,following the two teenage female leads around so closely we get to know them at ground level, so to speak. Tracy, who gets involved in some pretty bad stuff at Evie's persuasion, is presented as a good student gone bad.  She does have at least one intelligent line of dialogue which is ""If all of us in the world would marry a person of a different race, prejudice would disappear in 1 generation."" But she is rather disrespectful of her mother whom she mostly wishes would leave her alone.  Holly Hunter is also excellent as the sympathetic mom with a deadbeat boyfriend who is somewhat suspicious of her child's illegal activities but still wants to give her plenty of room to be herself. For starters, Tracy engages in theft of a wallet and in sex. ""Thirteen"" is a very down-to-earth and rather shocking at times examination of some  current teenage values. But those who don't enjoy tongue or belly-button piercing, or assault, the effects of which are numbed by the use of mind-altering drugs, might find the film's reality-based cinematography a bit hard to take.

1969968,4,B00013RC2K,"i actually saw this movie just for the hell of it. i didn't like it but it was good.  the reason i didn't like it was because i found the characters -- all of them -- to be infuriatingly dopey. i could have entered the movie through the tv screen and shook each and every one of them --Especially the Father -- and told them to not act like such complete dodo's but i don't have those kinds of super powers unfortuantely. so they kept acting all stupid and i kept watching them act all stupid and i kept getting more annoyed until the point when the movie suddenly ended.

the movie is a tale of a junior high school age chick (13-hence the title) who is troubled because she was basically abandoned by her bastard father but she is lucky enough to have a nice caring mother and at first they have a nice relationship almost like friends and not mother/daughter which usually doesn't work but it does at first in this case because the daughter part of the equation has a good head on her shoulders and is respectable.  or should i say WAS!

what happens is she is befriended by a horrible chick who is bad as hell and turns the nice but troubled girl into a freaky slut. she drinks like a fiend and acts genuinely stupid and does this and that behind her mothers back and when Mom finds out she was doing this and that she gets freaked out and their relationship goes into a tailspin and that frienedship that they had suffers and her parenting fails because she cannot help or talk any sense into her daughter because she simply doesnt know how. and then some more things happen and then some other things and then the movie ends.

the thing that really impressed me about this flick was the acting of the main girl. i believ she had little or no acting ecxperience but don't quote me on that and she did a remarkable job portraying a troubled adolecescent who had difficulty adapting to the high school environment and to the world itself (like most of us).

holly hunter is always good and the bad friend was good as well. the stoery was well told and i hope the story is not realistic but it may be because i don't know any thirteen or fourteen or fifteen year old girls so i wouldn't know about it.  anyway i hope it wasn't too realistic because the girl needed to relax a little bit and take it slow. do what you want but relax a little for gods sake.

I did not grow up nor have I ever lived in California, which is where the movie takes place, but from what I hear, it is just as bad in some schools (or in some crowds), as this movie potrays. I say that because L.A has one of the largest crime rates in America. Even big schools in great areas have the sames problems as the ones shown in this movie. If you in fact have not seen this movie, I would reccomend it to anyone.

Thirteen will scare all prospective parents into sterility.  How any parent would deal with a situation like this is not explained in the movie.  Good girl Tracey is influenced by bad girl Evie, and dives headfirst into sex, alcohol, drugs, truancy, and ""cutting"" - but, she was self-injuring before she met Evie.  Tracey's mother, Melanie, is a ""cool"" mom with hippie tendencies.  Holly Hunter is very powerful as Melanie, a recovering alcoholic with a recovering drug addict boyfriend.  Mel is incapable of laying down the law, and gives into Tracey for fear of not being liked.  As Tracey slides deeper into the abyss, with Evie practically living in their house, Mel does not know what to do.  At so many moments in the movie, when her scary, demon child daughter is screaming abuse into her face, you think, ""she's finally going to slap the [...] out of her"" - but she never does.

Yet, just because the subject matter is so disturbing and in-your-face doesn't mean you should reject it.  Teens today suffer from a myriad of problems and temptations. Even those who grow up in a stable, two-parent household  succumb to the same self-destructive activities.  Catherine Hardwicke did a fabulous job directing, and it is unusual that Nikki Reed (the 13 yr.-old who plays Evie) co-wrote the screen play with the director.  All the actors and actresses in Thirteen poured their hearts into the film, which was shot 90% on handheld cameras, lending to that documentary feel.  Also interesting is that neither Hardwicke nor Hunter have children.  Hardwicke strongly felt this story needed to be told - and they are right.

I do not know if this movie is a must-see for all parents of teenage girls, as well as the girls themselves or whether it just too painful for parents to see.  It shows just how difficult it is to raise a child in a single parent home.  And, Holly Hunter's mother is another in a long line of great performances by the actress.  Her intensity, pathos, empathy and pain are all readily experienced by the viewer.  The difficulties which she must take on as a parent seem overwhelming, and in some ways insurmountable.  Nikki Reed's portrayal of Evie is surely one of the more insidious realistic young people ever in film.  Both well written and well played.  I just do not see how this film could have been any better in any area.",1092700800,3,1193,4.472222222222222

See Tracy have sex. See Tracy terrorize her mother. See Tracy cut herself. See Tracy flunk out of school. See Tracy's whole life start to unravel.

And, after seeing all this, you ponder: who, or what, is to blame for Tracy's downward spiral? Is it her seductive, dangerous new best friend? Her natural adolescent impulse to form her own identity? A desire for acceptance and popularity? Her permissive, recovering-alcoholic mother or her self-absorbed father? Or is the whole of society to blame ... a society that produces self-loathing in little girls and encourages them to become sexual commodities as soon as possible?

I have a brother who has been in and out of rehab for drug use and friends who face the same problems Tracy and her friends do. Although at times it does feel a little extreme, I felt that I could really relate to Tracy and Evie, the ""it"" girl whom Tracy befriends. Another great thing about Thirteen is that it not only showed how Tracys mistakes affected herself, but her family and friends.

I've seen similar portraits of the scenes portrayed in this film in real life. No, it's not KIDS, but it is more intimate than KIDS.

The actors were exceptional. Totally believable! Distrubing, engrossing, and hard to look at if you know of someone with the same situation of a family torn, bit by bit with gritty measures.

1969985,3,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" is about the transition from kid to teenager, unfortunately, that transition is difficult and for some kids is even harder because there could be bad companies and temptations like sex, alcohol and drugs, things that could destroy young lives. Of course, not all the kids are going to fall on those addictions, but there are a lot of teenagers that do fall. ""Thirteen"" is a movie that tells the story of Tracy, a young girl that takes the easy way.

 Tracy is played by the young actress Evan Rachel Wood, and Evan does an excellent job, she makes her character believable at all time, she has a lot of screen presence and she could be one of the best actresses of her generation, she is pretty and talented. Another young actress, Nikki Reed plays the role of Evie Zamora, the popular girl that drags Tracy to the addictions. Nikki also co-wrote the screenplay of ""Thirteen"", the other writer is Catherine Hardwicke, she also directs the movie.

 There are a couple of things that I love about ""Thirteen"". Number one, this is a movie that showcases female talent (to the previous names, add the name of another actress, Holly Hunter), ""Thirteen"" shows that an all-girl team can make a very good movie. So if you don't want to see this film because you think it's a girly movie, get rid of that idea, ""Thirteen"" is a powerful movie. The other thing that I love about ""Thirteen"" is the fact that the movie doesn't try to preach, the typical message of ""don't do this, is bad"" doesn't exist in ""Thirteen"". The film looks so real that one might think that this a documentary. (Potential SPOILER, don't read the next lines if you haven't seen the film) sure, it shows some consequences of the excesses, but the film doesn't give us the typical dramatic final speech, as a matter of fact, we don't really know if these girls are going to overcome their addictions.

 ""Thirteen"" is a very interesting movie, showcases young and talented girls like Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed, also there is veteran female talent like Holly Hunter and director Catherine Hardwicke.",1091750400,,2073,4.696969696969697

To be honest,I never expected it to be a good movie, and when I watched it...I almost died of boredom.

 First of all, if you saw a good student with straight A's, you would think that she'd be smart enough not to ditch her friends. You'd also think she'd be smart enough not to do drugs and start smoking. But she wasn't.

 Second, the cutting? Oh my god. Seriously, that's the worst reason I've ever heard of someone cutting themselves. She gave me the impression of cutting just because she wasn't ""popular enough"". When Evie (or whatever her name is) left her to go to a party, she cut herself in the bathroom because she didn't get to go. To me, that's just screaming idiotic and fake depression. ""Boo hoo! I'm not popular enough. I don't think Evie likes me, therefore I think I should cut myself just to be melodramatic.""

 Melodramatic. That's what the entire movie is.

 And I could not stand her attitude towards her mom. What made me even more angry was that her mom didn't do anything about it.

 I know she's supposed to act like that...but seriously...if you were a mother, would you LET your child talk to you that way? Wouldn't you discipline her?!

 I'm sorry if I have offended anyone, but this was a VERY STUPID movie. I didn't like a thing about it. I don't recommend anyone to see it unless they want to fall asleep or be bored to tears.

She toys with drugs, sex, and stealing in order to impress her wild friend Evie (played amazingly by Nikki Reed, who, funnily enough, co-scripted the movie, and in real life was the inspiration for the Tracy character).

For me, the movie was a reminder of what it means to grow up in a crappy environment.  I didn't come from a broken home, but I had friends who were just like Evie - manipulative, easy, and very troubled.  Luckily I never got sucked into their depraved world, but I knew the drugs, sex, etc. were out there.

I actually found myself laughing in some spots, like when the girls are punching each other because they are high and can't feel anything.  To me, the film depicts the stupidity of youth, and feels very true to life.  Nikki Reed and Catherine Hardwicke should be commended for their screenplay.

 The story is very nice. And Evan Rachel Wood is fantastic and beautiful, for a such young actress. I know her work since Once and Again, and since than I became her fan...by the way.. we have the same age.

It's a phase of changes, discoverys, experiences... and the film is saying that if you don't open your mind to see that you don't have to change who you are, and drog yourself to be popular in high school, you gonna end with betrayal of the person you thought that was your "" coolest friend"" and crying for help in your mother's arms who you desrespect while you were ""high"".

1969994,5,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen is the kind of movie that stays fresh in your mind even weeks after seeing it. Although many of the predominant themes exist in many other teen movies, Thirteen presents these issues in a daring and refreshing new style. The sometimes jiggly camera-work, far from inducing motion sickness, actually adds to the gritty realism, in my opinion. The characters are well rounded and believable, and the plot moves along at the perfect breakneck pace befitting the main characters' descents into decadent mayhem.

 Despite its aversion to obvious preaching, Thirteen is undoubtably a cautionary tale. And as far as cautionary tales go, it is beautifully engaging. Tracy and Evie's otherwise foolish escapades become all-engrossing and you just can't look away from the train wreck.

 Now a word about shock value: If you're extremely easily-offended, don't see this movie. It features sex, drug use, (rampant and severe) profanity and self-cutting behaviors--all performed by young teens. On the other hand, the educational and artistic value of the film overrides the shock value.

 Try it out, and if you hate it, you can always press the stop button.

 Another thing: The soundtrack is perfect. Also pay attention to the color palette used over the duration of the film. It goes from unobtrusive pastels to glowing warm hues to drab greys and blues, following Tracy's journey from good daughter to glamourous and popular bad girl to desperate outcast.",1091059200,2,1457,5.196581196581197

We have those who think this film was a revelation, that it realisticaly depicted the harsh side of teen drug addiction and reckless behavior, well this audience obviously hasn't seen ""KIDS,"" ""GUMMO,"" or ""L.I.E."" These films shock the mind and the senses with their graphic depictions of sex, drugs and violence and their disturbingly real camera work. Thirteen was neither of these.
We also have those who thought this film was an absolute waste of two hours. That it was not. While it was not a marvel to behold, it was not horrible crap either. It holds it's own, unfortunately the hype made it something it was not.
While Evan Rachel Wood's performance was powerful and beautifully layered the film seemed like a cross between 90210 and MTV.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the film for what it was worth, but it definitely wasn't worth the hype it received.
The film does have many strong points. Evan Rachel Wood, and ofcourse the amazing Holly Hunter. It was co-written by Nikki Reed, who also stars in the film, a young girl who really lived through a similar situation. Although the storyline seems real the dialogue sometimes comes off as less than creative.

This in no way takes away from the quality of movie especially the acting. Both of the young girl characters as well as the rest of the family  portray a family that is lost in transition perfectly. I just thought it would shine some light on the subject of teen cutting and self absorbtion and destruction. The storyline just stuck to visually showing you the problems instead of answering or helping someone out with those problems. Anyone with a preteen child and parents that are either in denial or absent have already experienced and seen everything this movie portrayed. The shock value is for those that only have their heads underground, pretending that life is wonderful.
I guess I have the same feeling with this movie that I had with Boyz N the Hood. It's a great entertaining movie but also a movie that only sticks to telling America what it already knows, ""if you don't gain control over your children at a young age, they will gain control over you"".",1089763200,2,1209,4.649532710280374

This is their world, filled with the dangers of drugs, sex, and other risky activities.
Yeah, right.
The leads include the talented Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter.  And then there is the case of a not-so-talented lead, Nikki Reed.  More on her later.
Catherine Hardwicke is the director of this indie flick - she is also a friend to Reed.  The result of their pooled efforts is a film that looks like a documentary, giving you a YOU ARE HERE sort of vibe.  The downside?  The girls look older than 13 year-old 7th graders.  They are, in fact.  Wood and Reed were both fifteen during the time the film was shot.  Had the film been called FIFTEEN, I may have liked it that much better.
Yes, 13 year olds have sex - they have been for some time. I know that.  Other aspects seemed to be placed in the film just to shock.  The girls get stoned and punch each other multiple times, until one of them goes careening off the bed and hits the floor.
""Hit me.  Harder!  I can't feel anything!""
I guess that scene was put in to shock.  All it made me do was laugh.  Yes, I know, I know.  I shouldn't find humor in such frighteningly ""real"" situations, should I?
If Hardwicke had used actual 13 year old girls, the story may have been a tad more believable.  But quite frankly, I kept forgetting the movie was all about 13 year olds!  Whenever the girls partake in illicit activities, my reaction was, ""Here we go again."" ::eyeroll::
Holly Hunter is very good as Traci's (Wood) mother, who's got issues of her own.  Perhaps this is why her little girl ends up on the wrong path, being that troubled children ALWAYS come from broken homes (can ya recognize sarcasm when you hear it?).  Wood is good as Traci - her middle name is Lords.  Prior to letting Evie (Reed) corrupt her, she's a sweet little angel, writer of bad poetry with a few good friends.  We never find out why Traci wants to be popular, simply that she just wants to be.  Guess her loyal and normal friends aren't good enough.  We never find out why that is...
A friendship develops between Traci and Evie in a matter of 5 minutes.  These girls work fast.  Ha.  And in more ways than one.
Traci was a wonderful student in school, very bright, very smart.  Yet for some reason, she isn't bright enough to stay away from a girl like Evie.  Go figure.
Soon, the girls are up to all sorts of illicit activities.  It got excruciatingly tedious and boring very quickly.  As I mentioned prior, my reaction wasn't, ""Oh my goodness gracious!""  Nope.  It was, ""Here we go again.""  :-P
THIRTEEN tries to be a wakeup call to America, saying, ""Open your eyes!  This is all real!""  and it aims to shock every chance it gets.  In fact, this movie is strikingly similar to Larry Clark's KIDS (1995).  They both aim to shock incessantly.  They both try to be painstaking wakeup calls to America.  The only difference is that Hardwicke is not a pedophilic pervert like Larry Clark.
Oh, and did I mention that both films left me totally, completely unmoved?  I felt nothing.  I laughed once or twice.  That's about it.
I'd recommend THIRTEEN to a Holly Hunter or Evan Rachel Wood fan.  Both leads showed true skill in the acting department.  Reed, on the other hand, was bland.  No wonder they refused to let her play Wood's role when she auditioned.  She can't act, simple as that.  She's just riding the coattails of famous friends...

After that it goes back four months prior to the event, and Tracey's story starts to unfold.
Tracey lives in a very unstable house: her mom's in AA, her dad's never there, and her brother smokes pot. She's intelligent, but she wants to fit in with a different group of friends. She wants to be friends with Evie, the it girl that everyone loves. Eventually she does get to hang out with her, and she starts falling into a downward spiral of drugs, sex, stealing, drinking, etc.
The way this movie is filmed is brilliant - sometimes the movie is in full color, while other times it looks black and white, and sometimes there's color but its faded. It's filmed at a fast, camera-spinning pace, and it adds more reality to the film. There's a lot of swearing (many ""effs"" thrown around), there's also drug use, sexuality, and nudity.

I can watch this over & over & over again...it gets to me. the acting is out of this world. the movie speaks the truth without ammending the more gritty details. KUDOS to NIKKI REED for co-writing & co-starring. AWESOME! i hope to see more of EVAN RACHEL WOOD, TOO...i could feel her pain...i could she the mask she wore so she could ""fit in"" and ""be happy""...but when the mask came off, she was seriously depressed to the point of ""cutting"" or self mutilation. AND FINALLY, THE GREAT HOLLY HUNTER. NEED I SAY MORE?
I love the cinematography. the gritty city at night...the colors...the waves & changes in camera movement...and the little things like the ""for rent"" sign...everyone else wants out of her world. now she is truly alone. but mom won't let her go. mom can save her with all the love she feels for her daughter.

1970010,5,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.
Thirteen is about a girl named Tracy. Tracy is a normal girl with normal friends and plays out the role of a good girl. Tracy notices a girl, Evie, at school that all the guys are eyeing and she wants to be like her and fit into her crowd. Once they become friends Tracy changes everything. She begins to steal clothes,money and many other things. Her style in clothes becomes very different. She went from regular t-shirts to almost no clothes. The worst part is that she starts experimenting with drugs and her mother is clueless in the beggining. Tracy has an older boyfriend, drinks, and ignores her real friends. Tracy starts to get the attention she wants but it eventually gets out of controll. Evie begins to live with Tracy and together they are one big disaster. This film is very touching and has a surprising ending. Its also prety deep. The movie shows you what can happen to you and how you can become out of controll if you chose the wronge ""crowd."" I could watch this movie all day and it will have a great affect on me. It is truley a wonderful film that everyone should see.",1086825600,,1155,4.376744186046512
1970011,3,B00013RC2K,"I'll grant the good reviewers that their are some amazing actors and actresses in this movie.  It is the screenplay itself I found a little, well, ummm...sick.  While I'm sure the director was sincere in her effort to make an realistic movie about today's teenagers - specifically thirteen-year-old girls, I feel that she missed the mark on a few things:
#1. We never see Tracy's friends (the good girls) going about life without resorting to the extremely disastrous decisions Tracy embraces.  This would have been a good way to show the results of good decisions, contrasting the negative decisions made by Tracy
#2. In reality, Tracy would see her downfall more clearly than the screenplay suggests.  I made a LOT of bad decisions during my teen years; I and all of my friends discussed our stupid decisions amongst each other - consulting each other for advice.  Tracy doesn't approach anyone about her bad decisions.  This just doesn't hold up with a screenplay chasing after reality.
#3. Most kids today have enough brains to realize peer pressure can drag you down, yet Tracy's character allows peer pressure to drowned her constantly.
Now, the good things.  Holly Hunter is such a great actress, that I love everything she does. Evan Rachel Wood complimented Holly Hunter well; the scene when Holly's character (Tracy's Mom) continues to hug her daughter after finding out how far her daughter has fallen may just be one of the most moving scenes filmed in the past few years.
As a screenplay writer and author, I found this movie to be a sincere effort at making a film about today's teenager; a movie that is brilliant in parts and very shallow in other parts.  I hope people who loved this movie are not too mad at me for any criticism I have for this movie; I have to say how I truly feel - the same way the director has to make the film she wants.
I am very interested in looking up other movies directed by Catherine Hardwicke to see more of her work.

The film is very good at chronicling the boys, the drugs and the stealing, but I felt that it was a bit slim in showing what motivated Tracy to star down that path.  I realize that fitting in and being popular is of vital importance at that age, but I wanted to the movie to make me really feel that need rather than rely on my own memories of it.  Holly Hunter turns in a powerful, raw performance as Tracy's mother--I really appreciated her story more than that of the girls.

1970013,4,B00013RC2K,"This movie was moving and relevant.  As the title tags it, it's about being a thirteen year old girl and trying to fit in with a cool crowd. The camera shot choices give it a documentary feel and the plot certainly comes across true enough.  It could have very easily fallen into one of those gratuitous teen sex flicks given it's subject matter.  But it never wandered from it's harsh and very real portrayal of a family's struggle by catering to purile interests and believe me, there were plenty of scenes that were of that nature.  Kudos to the director for keeping this movie focused.  In fact, the only scene of nudity involved an adult, the mother, in a totally appropriate scene (coming from the shower).  A very honest movie that touched on what faces the teenagers of today and don't kid yourself that it's only those kids in CA or NY.  Flashes of advertisements showing distorted images of sexuality and beauty were effective and the scenes of socialization could be updated ""Lord of the Flies"".  There were so many social issues that were touched upon that I give it good marks for effort.  I also liked the whole way it dealt with these issues.  However, I couldn't stand the ending and it ruined the overall movie experience for me.  I hate it when movies leave the ending open to interpretation just as a method of ending.  This technique can be used effectively when part of the plot itself (Swimming Pool for instance), but it doesn't work here at all.  Leaving it at the mother and daughter scene before that silly playground one would have made it a better film and left this viewer not feeling so let down.

The way they show the ""downfall"" of the lead character, and her desire to be liked (and to get a reality escape from events at home) has been done very well, and it feels very real. We could empathize with her as well as her mom, and talked about this movie long after the credits rolled..
She's justa  13 year old, who wants to be cool, hip like the other girl(s)... this movie kinda shows that one of biggest obstacles for young teens are other teens themselves (not drugs or sex etc.). you don't know whom to blame - moms, friends, brother, the absent dad or just the fact that protaganist has noone left to confide to except her ""best"" friend..

Maybe you're blind to the fact that all around you, there's teenagers going through the exact same thing. You can choose to believe it or not, like it or not, but it happens, deal with it.

Towards the middle of the movie, it started to seem like this movie was pandering to guys who would rather see 13 year olds having sex than actually sitting down and watching a movie that had some actual substance.
Towards the end, the movie got a little too artsy. The fight with her mother was long and drawn out, especially the crying. The end was all summed up by various time-elapsed shots of the girl and her mother sleeping in bed together, and culminating in her spinning around on the merry-go-round, looking at the sun, and giving out a loud scream.

Her new friendship with the popular and alluring Evie (Nikki Reed who also co-wrote the film) begins Tracy's downward spiral, while her recovering alcoholic mother (Holly Hunter in an Oscar nominated role) struggles to maintain her fractured family life.  What helps make Thirteen all the more genuine is that Reed, an actual teenager, co-wrote the film with director Catherine Hardwicke, giving the film a realistic point of view combined with Hardwicke's handcam documentary style approach.  Shocking, at times horrifying, and hard to watch at some points; Thirteen ends up being something you'll not likely forget after viewing.",1085875200,,875,5.372262773722627
1970018,5,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen, co-written by Nikki Reed who also co-stars (Nikki) as the popular teenager archetype is a terrifying examination of the realities of being a teenager today.  What is so gripping is the causal realities of expressed in this film: damaged people who inflict their wounds on their youngsters through apathy, divorce, and drug and alcohol addiction.  We witness the effects on their families as both Tracy (Rachel Wood) and Evie (Nikki Reed) find themselves in a self-destructive relationship each exploring the world of drugs and sex and peer pressure.  You can see why each of them are drawn both to each other and to the world they inhabit and it feels more like a documentary than a film.
  As the film draws to a close the relationship comes apart and Tracy is given a second chance to turn things around while Evie will continue the slow destructive path to who-knows-where.  Holly Hunter is brilliant as Tracy's Mom having to capture the character of a recovering alcoholic who's life is in turmoil without ever going for the TV movie of the week tear jerker.
  The ending is a painful reminder of how hard it's going to be for both of them.  What terrifies me most is how it is obvious that this trend will continue and how families today are little different than families of any generation except the accessibilities of drugs and sex makes for a terrifying reality that I doubt will change.  Thirteen will leave you with a sick stomach and a chilling reality.  It's not so much about plot as it is a character study that is so real that as a parent you will loose sleep over it.

1970019,3,B00013RC2K,"What the film 'Thirteen' displays is a symbolic motif of what teenagers, namely females, go through.  Because it is unflinching in its presentation, the symbolism behind it can be misconstrewed as 'this is what all teens go through.'  And while it is probably fair to say that many teens have had their brush with drugs, sex, and disfunctional families, 'Thirteen' is almost too eager to present the life of an urban teen.  The premise is similiar too what many Junior high students feel they must do: fit in.  Tracy ( Evan Rachel Wood), is the quiet and meek good girl.  Her eager to please attitude and outcast status at her school draws her to Evie (Nikki Reed-who also co-wrote the script).  Because Evie posseses raw sexuality and an overtly shallow confidence, Tracy finds her alluring. It only takes a 2 to three minute scene before Evie and Tracy exchange dialogue and become friends.
What transpires between these two young ladies is a brutally, if not exaggerated, relationship based on drugs, stealing, sex and unprovoked anger.  Although I was not convinced nor shocked by the girls behavior, Mel's (Holly Hunter in a heartbreaking performance) utter blindness of Evie's lies and Tracy's rants left me most affected.  Hunter's naievete is bound to leave viewers with the widest spectrum of emotion.  Hunter's willingness to give love and befriend her daughter is most likely what contributes to Tracy's descent from a well-balanced girl to out-of-control floozy.
As ambitious as it tried-and wanted- to be, 'Thirteen' never breaks from the bounds of an after school special.  Tracy's plight is overtly aimed at parents on what to look out for.  But because not all teenagers act like Tracy and Evie, it should only be taken as a coming-of-age drama.  Holly Hunter's fierce and vulnerable performance is most convincing, as she desperately tries- and fails- to win back Tracy.  If 'Thirteen' would have focused on less 'eager to shock' methods, it could have been taken more seriously by me.  Co-star and co-writer Nikki Reed went through much of the same turmoil as displayed in the film, but viewers should remember that she is one teen among many, and this unflinching but the over-the-top ""expose"" of sorts only shows a slight piece of the reality of young teens.

Shoplifting, drinking, drugs, selfharm, promiscuity......I felt like I understood Tracy, inside out. Before that I played with dolls and vowed to never even smoke a cigarette.
That all happened when I was fourteen. Now I'm seventeen, and all that's left to remind me of that period in my life is a few faint scars, a pile of stolen CDs and the knowledge that the teenage years are not a golden cheerleader dream; they are frightening, exciting, horrible and wonderful all at the same time.

No, ""Thirteen"" most definitely isn't in the horror flick genre, but it's ability to frighten speaks to the film's unflinching portrait of the pressures of adolescence for young girls becoming women.  Parents of teenage daughters may wince, but it seems to offer a more complete understanding or reminder of what those formative years could be like.
There are some pretty amazing performances here, top of which is turned in by Holly Hunter as a single mom divorcee, reformed addict trying desperately to hold herself and family together.  Her performance is honest, true, and entirely believable.  Also amazing is the performance turned in by Evan Rachel Wood as the misguided and mal-influenced teen that takes a tailspin dive when following popularity at the hands of a manipulative ""it"" girl.  And now to the best performance that turned in by the ""it"" girl played by Nikki Reed.  Here's the catch and the amazing story behind ""thirteen.""  Reed's top bill performance isn't on screen.  She wrote the screenplay as a teenager, a simply phenomenal accomplishment; we get the vision straight from the horse's mouth.  That's accounts for the film;s truism.
Don't miss this film.  Scenes of shopping and model ads may seem like a unoriginal trademark tool in other films but they underlie the message of the pressure we as a society place on young girls to be cool, to be beautiful, to be thin, to be in.  That's pressure a developing young adult could do without.  Yet another fine point driving you to watch ""Thirteen.""  Don't miss it.

Doesn't mean I can't be moved or even repelled.  It just means that a movie doesn't make me say ""whoa!"" just because someone is doing something that I myself wouldn't do.  But aside from that, I wasn't moved at all by this.  Even the ""happy"" ending seemed to make it worse.  The movie drags you through the gutter (well, a glittery Hollywood gutter, since these girls are conventionally beautiful), then slaps on an ending that is supposed to make you misty.  I just didn't fall for it.  I don't know why, but I didn't.  It felt too forced.  It felt like it was made for teenagers, which I am not (and I don't think like one).  It honestly feels like it's supposed to make teenagers feel kind of cool about being a teenager today (like a movie like ""The Breakfast Club"" made me feel nearly 20 years ago).  How could an adult director not realize that most grownups today don't think teenagers are very cool?  (Or does she identify herself with teenagers--I mean what was up with that hair/wig in the bonus featurette??)
Anyway, if I had passed on this movie then I wouldn't have missed a thing.  Holly Hunter is good, as always, but her character seemed too fake and was not well drawn.

P.S.  When I was thirteen, I was still watching Saturday morning cartoons, and the only drug that I had even heard of was marijuana.  That was 22 years ago, but have we really sunk this low in America?  I'd like to think not, and that this movie just used that age to add to the sensationalism.

1970036,4,B00013RC2K,"A thirteen-year-old girl wrote the story for this movie, so it is reasonable to assume that the facts presented are real or at least very close to reality. This is one of the aspects that makes the story so difficult to endure. The situation is presented in a way that shocks the viewers and leaves one in fear of having to deal with a similar problem.
The movie starts out showing Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Evie (Nikki Reed) getting high in the house of the former. The action immediately goes back to the time in which Tracy was starting out in high school as a completely normal kid. We see how peer pressure affects the way adolescents act and how detrimental it is for their development. Tracy, in her desire to become popular and hang out with the ""queen"" of the place, Evie, pressures her mother into spending money on clothes, moves to stealing and cannot stop the slippery slope from then on. She deserts her previous friends and gets involved in drugs and consequently sex.

In the meantime, the movie presents a great depiction of how these facts affect the parents, and in this case specifically, the mother (Holly Hunter). Tracy's mom is a former drug addict, fighting to stay clean while trying to rebuild her relationship with her former boyfriend, Mason. The performances of the whole cast is superb, and this is one of the reasons why the movie is so disturbing. I only recommend you to watch this movie if you feel you can endure a story that is depressing and brings out fear in most people.",1081641600,,1524,4.582417582417582

A character like Tracy often gets a child actress who makes too many facial expresions for her own good, but this time, they got a real actress (not child actress) who can deliver lines alongside the great Holly Hunter. I could go on for a long time talking about Holly Hunter's acting, but I wont, cause I'm too tired and it's boring to real. I'll just say she's magnificent.
The script was well written, portraying how real teenage girls talk... anyway, the only thing I didn't like was:
a) this movie made me cry

1970040,3,B00013RC2K,"An enticing and relevant indie effort, ""Thirteen"" stands as a pleasant surprise and a peculiar teen movie. This coming-of-age tale about a 13-old girl (the impressive Evan Rachel Wood, from the TV-Show ""Once and Again"") who suddently begins exploring her darker side isn`t grounbreaking material, yet suceeds as a compelling effort nonetheless.
Director Chaterine Hardwicke offers an intriguing debut oeuvre, one that dares to take a deep and risky look at today`s teenagers. ""Thirteen"" presents a strong and vivid visual style, full of energy and dynamism and somewhat reminiscent of MTV. The direction also offers a documentary-like quality, being quite realistic and credible on its approach. Hardwicke manages to develop key subjects such as family connections, sexual initiation, drug and alcohol abuse, school relationships and hierarquies, the access to popularity and many other key issues of urban societies.
Although this movie could have been an average and moralistic afterschool special, it wisely avoids easy melodrama and stereotyped situations, presenting a wide-eyed perspective with enough ambiguity and depth. The lead character Tracy changes quite fast (perhaps way too fast), and her search for a different and stronger personality is well showcased here, evolving from a cute, smart and innocent girl to an experienced, trendy and hip ""lolita"" that enters a downward spiral. The movie`s pacing is well-balanced and the powerful soundtrack adds a vital sense of rythm and confusion. The performances are noteworthy as well, especially Holly Hunter as a young and worried mother who doesn`t know how to react to her daughter`s behaviour.

Come on! One person could not change you in such a way that you would start shoving your mom and piercing yourself up, you would already have to be pretty messed up in the first place.

While I think some dramatic license was taken with everything happening to one kid, across the board, I was made to understand that *all* of the stuff and more that was protrayed in the movie was accurate to what has happened in the past and what is happening now - especially so in the Southern Californian setting.

1970045,3,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen (Catherine Hardwicke, 2003)
So much hype around this movie, and how quickly we forget (or never knew in the first place. When star Evan Rachel Wood says in the DVD extras that no film has ever treated this subject quite like this before, I wondered how the director (the screenwriter, being only thirteen years of age, has an obvious excuse) can have managed to miss Harmony Korine's brilliant, devastating 1995 film Kids. And that certainly wasn't the only time I saw the specter of Kids hanging over this production.
Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood, from Profiler) is starting her first day of seventh grade. She's your typical geek girl, maybe a little prettier than most. Upon reaching school, she finds herself overcome with jealousy when all the males notice a small group of girls dressed all in black and looking bad. She endeavors to get herself in by befriending one of them, Evie (scriptwriter Nikki Reed). Evie and the crowd introduce her to various bad behaviors, and Tracy goes from being a model student to rock bottom practically overnight.
Despite Evan Rachel Wood's Best Actress-worthy performance, the movie is simply too easy. It falls into too many of the urban legend traps that one expects from a movie like this, but hopes won't show up. (That the screenwriter was herself thirteen both makes us want to cut her some slack and, if this is truly autobiographical, smack her upside the head for exaggerating in the most predictable ways possible.) The characters find themselves in utterly predictable situations and react in utterly predictable ways. This leads to such scenic contradictions as Holly Hunter and Deborah Unger's climactic confrontation over the behavior of their respective children, where Hunter can't seem to tell which way to turn to slap someone. Unger, it should be noted, is not nearly as much fun onscreen as she usually is; if you want to see this lady act, rent Crash. Here, she's nothing more than scenery. And Hunter? Well, she's never been the world's greatest actress. She's survived since The Firm playing herself over and over again (with the exception of her woefully-out-of-place casting in The Piano); here, she does exactly that once again. Nothing you haven't seen before, folks. On the good side are Wood and Jeremy Sisto (Caesar, May) as Hunter's on-again off-again boyfriend.
The odd pairing of Hunter (born in 1958) and Sisto (born in 1974) serves to reinforce one of the movie's finest (and, perhaps, most ironic) moments: the attempted seduction of the next door neighbor by the two teens. Odd age disparities bounce around this movie like pinballs just after you've hit the multi-ball bonus. And they all seem okay except this one. Perhaps they're trying to send a message about the idiocy of the magic age law, especially as it concerns young female instigators?
Not a bad little movie, but really not as good as all the hype made it out to be. If your breath was taken away by how original this movie was, run, do not walk, to your local decent video store and rent Kids. ***",1080518400,,3044,4.878378378378378

That it was just one more manipulative moment in a movie chock full of them.  ""Thirteen"" depends upon shock, but the problem is, when you manipulate the viewer to such a degree, shock instead becomes a yawn, and sometimes even a giggle as you cross off each no-no (sex, drugs, body-piercing, shoplifting, sneaking out the window, etc).  There is so much overacting in ""Thirteen"" that I can't help but compare it to the cult flick ""Mommie Dearest.""  There are a number of fine teenage wasteland movies out there, starting with ""Rebel without a Cause,"" which to some extent ""Thirteen"" may be closest to.

1970058,5,B00013RC2K,"The toughest and truest coming of age movie in years, THIRTEEN is not for the faint of heart--and not for children without a healthy dose of parental accompaniment.  It's about what happens when the normal post-pubescent urge to individuate from family and find peer-group acceptance conspires with a severely decadent society to make adolescence a nightmare.  Watching the downward spiral of the desperate-to-be-""all that"" 13-year-old Tracy is as gut-wrenching as watching a car spin out in traffic yet being powerless to prevent the accident, partly because we've all known a ""Tracy"" or two, but mostly because of the passionate intensity that everyone involved has brought to this film.  There's no sugar-coating to this story, no Disneyfication, no crippling compromise for the sake of broad box-office appeal, just utterly committed storytelling as authentic and chilling as BOYZ N THE HOOD and MI VIDA LOCA.
Writer-director Catherine Hardwicke, co-writer Nikki Reed, cinematographer Elliot Davis, and the entire cast have crafted a movie that adroitly navigates a minefield of clichs by focusing on telling details, thus particularizing Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), her girlfriend Evie (played by co-writer Reed), her mother (Holly Hunter), and their interlocking relationships as well.  Hunter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her searingly authentic performance as Tracy's recovering alcoholic single mom, Mel, who enables Tracy's self-destructive slide by ignoring the warning signs that something is dreadfully wrong and neglecting the active parental intervention that the situation demands.  Co-author Reed is utterly convincing as the slyly manipulative Evie, who preys on Tracy's need to be regarded as cool, and on Mel's need to see herself as helpful and understanding.  Yet as good as Hunter and Reed are, this is Wood's movie, and she all but steals the show with the gutsiest, most accomplished performance by a young teen actress that I can recall.  (I suspect that only the MPAA's squeamishness about the subject matter kept Wood from an Oscar nomination of her own.)  All the supporting actors give remarkably fine performances, too, especially Brady Corbett as Tracy's older brother, Mason, and Deborah Kara Unger as Evie's out-of-it guardian, Brooke.
I admired this movie far more than expected.  It's not easy to watch, but that has nothing to do with D.P. Davis's judiciously artful use of the hand-held camera.  Rather it's because the story rings so painfully true, and because--like Tracy's mom--our society often neglects what's best for our kids for fear of offending them or those who prey upon them.  How many Evies and Tracys must suffer before we come to our senses and stop encouraging the conditions that enable such sorrows to flourish?  In short, THIRTEEN is a gutsy and very accomplished film about something that really matters--our kids, and the need not to shirk our responsibility for their welfare, especially in the treacherously amoral world we are bequeathing them.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if permitted, but given the choice Amazon allows, let's make it an even 5.",1079049600,6,3123,5.336048879837067
1970059,4,B00013RC2K,"When Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) entered the 7th grade, she was a model student who had a close relationship with her mother (Holly Hunter). Feeling left out and too childish for junior high school, she aspired to be part of the school's hip, worldly crowd, whose center is a girl named Evie (Nikki Reed). Evie takes Tracy under her wing, and soon her world includes sex, drugs, violence and body piercing. Under stress from her new social life and  problems at home, Tracy allows her wild lifestyle to turn into one long self-destructive binge.

""Thirteen "" was co-written by director Catherine Hardwicke and Nikki Reed. When Nikki Reed was thirteen years old, she and her friends were involved in the types of behavior depicted in the movie. Catherine Hardwicke was a family friend who encouraged Reed to find creative, as opposed to destructive, outlets for her energy. And one of those outlets was the screenplay for this film. Reed and Hardwicke based ""Thirteen"" on the experiences that Nikki and her friends had at that age. Nikki stars in the movie as well, very convincingly playing the slightly older, manipulative Evie. Evan Rachel Wood is fantastic in the lead role. Her performance as Tracy is one of the best of the 2003. Holly Hunter also strikes a perfect note as Tracy's mother Melanie who sensibly doesn't overreact to the discovery that her daughter is nearly grown and is going through an experimental phase, but becomes concerned when she senses Tracy's life is spinning out of control. The film looks remarkably good for something that was shot in 24 days on a small budget, which is a credit to Catherine Hardwicke and the cast. The performances are impressive. The story is interesting. But I have one apprehension about ""Thirteen"": Audiences tend to take negative or threatening depictions of teenagers in films as an indictment of young people and youth culture in general. I would hate for people to react this way to ""Thirteen"". It certainly isn't the filmmakers' intention. ""Thirteen"" treats young people and counterculture with a matter-of-fact respect that I find refreshing. The film depicts what can happen when people make bad decisions for the wrong reasons without demonizing sex, drugs, or belly rings and without  claiming that young people should act like middle-aged people. It's just about coming of age by extremes.

The DVD: Both widescreen and full screen versions are on the same disc! Bonus features include a ""making of"" featurette, an audio commentary by the director and her teenaged cast, deleted scenes, and a theatrical trailer. The ""making of"" documentary is short and includes interviews with the actors. The audio commentary features the comments of director Catherine Hardwicke, Evan Rachel Wood, Nikki Reed, and Brady Corbet, who plays Tracy's brother. The commentary is fun, spontaneous and informative, although I found it difficult to distinguish Nikki Reed's and Evan Rachel Wood's voices. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.

real quick question: any of ya'll 5-star-giving-""the makers of this movie are jesus""-spouting people ever see a little independent film released in 1995 called ""Kids?"" no? surprise!
first off, thirteen comes out swingin (figuratively and literally LO!L) with the two girls huffing those compressed-air things and then punching each other. that's neat. then, we're taken back 4 months earlier, to a point where tracy (the main character) is a sweet, innocent little girl with pie-in-the-sky poetry and big plans for her life. i mean, i think. they don't really ever flesh out character in this movie, so who knows.
shortly after her socks are made fun of for being too geeky (remember when dj wore the same clothes as her teacher and got made fun of on ""full house?"" like that), she throws out all of her clothes and all of her stuffed animals, starts snorting coke and cutting herself, and goes bisexual. waitwaitwait, i'm getting ahead of myself.
after that, she gets some new clothes and hangs out with the popular girls who (GASP) are a bad influence! this leads to all the aforementioned drugs, sex, blahblahblahblahblah.
see, the reason why this movie is horrible: because ""Kids"" came out almost 10 years ago, and is still more relevant and more shocking than this movie even ATTEMPTS to be. while harmony korine's street-prose writing skills make ""Kids"" seem like a documentary, every line in this movie sounds like something i saw on a sitcom. except with cursing. and while every single actor in ""Kids"" doesn't even seem like they're playing a character, the shmaltz flows like milk and honey in this movie. i mean, when Tracy is confronting her mom with ""NO BRA, NO PANTIES, NO BRA, NO PANTIES"" am i really supposed to feel intimidated? because all i really feel is sickeningly aroused. is that too much information?
you really come off feeling like this was created by a bunch of suits in a ""focus group"" or ""power meeting"" or ""whatever it is that they do when they want to pander to a certain age group.""
""well, those 'troubled' kids say naughty words and do drugs, right? let's use that as the basis for the movie. thoughts?""
""i've been thinking. people like nypd blue and the shield right? and what do they have in common? THE SEIZURE-CAM. you know. the one that can't hold still, that zooms in like a kid who accidentally pressed the button too hard. that's IN. i can FEEL IT.""
""LIGHTBULB! let's make the mom a single mother, but she's really COOL. she knows what's up, and she's confident.""
""like in gilmore girls?""
""...no, this is MY idea.""
the only thing this movie does is consistently drag out stereotypes of characters seen in other movies, television shows, etc.

Abandoning her friends, Tracy (superbly portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood) befriends one of the popular girls, Evie (played with finesse by Nikki Reed).  That is just the start of things, as Tracy's life develops into a downard spiral of drugs, sex, and crime...all to gain popularity (which, of course, in the end eludes her).
Holly Hunter, as Tracy's mother, is outstanding.  Everybody is perfectly cast; at times, it's hard to tell that this is a movie.  Which, in a way, is disturbing.  This is not a film for the squeamish; it's realistic, and it's brutally honest.  However, it is a good example of teen peer pressure (I'm a teen, so I'd know) and how some people can't cope with it.
It's been a week or two since I've seen THIRTEEN, but I still can't stop thinking about it.  It's gritty, it's engaging, and it's real--you may flinch, you may cry, you may gasp ""oh my God!"", but you'll come away with a sense that you've been in the mind of a troubled teenage girl, and are the better for it.

I felt I had just been on a wild roller coaster ride into the lives of a couple of 13-year old girls who are out of control and going too far in their experiments with life.  The film is written directed by Catherine Hardwick who I understand met Nicki Reed, a troubled 13 year old and suggested that she keep a diary. This film is a direct result of that diary with Nicki Reed, who is listed as a co-writer, cast in the role of the bad girl.  The other young star is Evan Rachel Wood, who starts out as a well-behaved seventh grader, but who, under the influence of her friend, starts to run wild too.  Their performances are so real that I cringed constantly, remembering my own early youth.  And then there is Holly Hunter, cast as Evan Rachel Wood's mother who loves her daughter but is overwhelmed with her own life and clueless about how to help.  Some of these scenes between mother and daughter are heart wrenching and tributes to love. This film packs a big punch.

Along the way we get a glimpse of the lifestyle of some California teenagers.  O.K.  Maybe they aren't typical.  But they do exist and we pass them on the street every day.  They have pierced tongues and navels.  They wear provocative clothes.  They hang out at the Mall and shoplift like crazy.  Of course there are boys in their lives.  And steamy romances.  And easy access to every kind of drug imaginable.  Sometimes they even practice self-mutilation.

The film is fast paced, the dialog is crisp and nasty, the settings absolutely realistic. There's tension throughout and it never lets up.  I was completely swept into the story.  This is not a comfortable film to watch, but I think it's a ""must see"".  Highly recommended.",1078444800,2,1775,4.515723270440252

1970066,5,B00013RC2K,"A film by Catherine Hardwicke
""Thirteen"" tells the story of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), a thirteen year old girl who, up until this point, has been a good girl.  She loves her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter), and listens to her.  She is not a very popular girl in school, though she does have her own friends.  We see her longing for a great social acceptance than what she has.  When Melanie's former addict ex-boyfriend comes back into the picture despite Melanie's previous promise that he will never be back, Tracy is hurt, upset, and angry.  From this she begins to take her first steps of rebellion.  Evie (Nikki Reed) is one of the most popular girls in school, as well as the hottest (as described by Tracy's brother).  It is obvious from the start that Tracy would like to be friends with Evie and perhaps have Evie's life.
The movie doesn't actually start here.  The movie starts with Tracy and Evie (both of them then unnamed) sitting on a bed, huffing from an aerosol can, and hitting each other in the face and laughing because they can't feel their faces.  The movie then moves to four months earlier when we see the more innocent Tracy, the pre-Evie Tracy.  Tracy tries to get the chance to hang out with Evie, but gets brushed to the side with every opportunity.  When she sees Evie shoplifting Tracy is first shocked but then very quickly sees an opportunity.  Tracy steals an older woman's wallet without getting caught and runs up to Evie, tells her what she did, and shares the money.  Evie and Tracy go on a little shopping spree and just like that they are inseparable.
Tracy is still fairly innocent, but the more time she spends with Evie the more she experiences: drugs, sex, alcohol, stealing, skipping classes, disobeying her mother, cursing at her mother.  We watch as Tracy's life begins to spiral out of control and Melanie sees what is happening, though she does not really understand why, and she is powerless to stop it.  Melanie is a recovering alcoholic herself, but she is doing the best she can as a single mother.  She is all heart, and other than her relationship with the ex-boyfriend I'm not sure she really does anything wrong to drive Tracy away.
That is perhaps the one flaw in this movie.  I had a difficult time figuring out Tracy's motivation for rebelling.  I understood the desire for social acceptance, but not the driving need for it, and the film never explained that.  Despite that lack of explanation on Tracy's motivation, this movie is filled with realistic, powerful performances.  I believed the characters were who they were supposed to be rather than just actors playing a role.  Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed had absolutely standout roles and they both did a fine job.  Younger actors always seem to be the most difficult to cast because they often sound wooden when speaking their lines, but not Evan or Nikki, they were spot on.  Nikki Reed should be highlighted as well because at age 13 she co-wrote this movie with the director and is now only 16 years old.  What a debut (both in acting as well as screenwriting)!
""Thirteen"" is a movie that, if I was a parent, would scare me.  It tells me that even if I don't do anything really wrong or bad, if I'm not careful my daughter can still fall into the wrong crowd and go down a very harmful path.  What is perhaps most frightening is that it is obvious from the movie that even before Tracy met Evie and started drinking and doing drugs that Tracy already had problems.  Tracy is a cutter.  When she is feeling low she locks herself in the bathroom and cuts into her forearms and just hides it with a long sleeve shirt.  I thought ""Thirteen"" was a rather good movie even though it doesn't provide any answers nor does it provide a motivation for Tracy.  It just says this is one possible reality for teenagers today.  And that is a scary thought.",1078185600,,3859,4.573508005822417
1970067,4,B00013RC2K,"Catherine Hardwicke's ""Thirteen"" takes a gritty look at the lives of urban teenagers and the hardships single parents face.  Holly Hunter's performance as Melanie, an L.A. hairdresser and single mother of two, is gripping and surreal.  The two teenage girl characters, Evie and Tracy, are on a one-way mission to destruction and there seems to be little that anyone can do about it.
What I think was most effective about this film is the fast-paced camera work (think ""Traffic"" without the sepia tones) and the Hollywood setting.  Melanie's n'er do well friends who come and go out of her household are especially realistic, and her good intentions are strongly portrayed.  Her recovering boyfriend ends up being a rather sympathetic character, which is a nice touch, also.  But all in all, the characters who shine are Tracy and Evie.  They are painful and true and their performances are definitely worthy of the acclaim that they have been receiving.
Watch this movie...These performances will not dissapoint.",1078185600,,1012,5.140243902439025
1970068,2,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen is an intense interpretation of teen life but fails because of its predictability and clichs. Nothing in this movie is original and at times it does seem preposterous and farfetched.
Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is one of those girls who dresses in clothes that are not in style and does well in her class works. She gets ridiculed because of her socks, which is quite childish even it is simply a teenager making those comments. She is not popular and hangs out with those that are like her, and of course, she is envious of those girls who are popular with the boys. I don't need to continue for you to know how this will play out.
Evie (Nikke Reed) on the contrary, is the most popular girl and hottest looking girl in school. She is conniving for she at first gives Tracy a false number and then shoplifts at a store. Trying to gain their friendship, Tracy steals a ladies wallet and goes on a shopping spree with her new gal pals. Tracy gets a whole new make out with provocative clothes and makeup and her life has completely turned upside down. This is one of the problems with Thirteen. The film is trying to convince us of Tracys sins with piercing and revealing clothes. It makes stereotypes to those who have piercing or wear sexy clothes as sinful.
Holly Hunter plays Tracys mom Melanie. She has a salon in her house and earns her living through it. She is apparently divorced and has a few problems within her little world also. She can barely contain her changed daughter and has a boyfriend named Brady (Jeremy Sisto) who has taken advantage of Melanie before. This is a typical setting for a movie involving the breakdown of a young teenage girl succumbing to peer pressure.
It would not be a movie about teenagers if it did not have sex and drugs. Tracy and Evie inhale, drink, sniffs, and smokes. Every scene in this movie dealing with drugs is fabricated. The movie opens with Tracy and Evie inhaling and punching and slapping each other with humor. Its more comical than it is disturbing. They make their money by also selling drugs but where did they get it in the first place? I just didn't buy the fact that as they were using these drugs that they did not have a bit of conscience and hesitation. It would have added more depth to these characters instead of merely having them do drugs loosely.",1078099200,3,2324,4.509478672985782
1970069,3,B00013RC2K,"I found this movie to be a realistic portrayal of two girls with a lot of problems.  The movie is content to show us the pain of their problems without offering commentary or insight into them.  A movie about pain with nothing deeper makes for an unpleasant movie.

The movie could have done a better job of showing just how Tracy went from a young woman with problems to a petty criminal.  I get the impression the movie blames her friendship with Evie, but that is simplistic.  Tracy seeks out Evie and lionizes her.  Evie doesn't have to twist Tracy's arm to make her commit crimes.

That is the what really makes the movie unpleasant-- Tracy, the main character, does not come off favorably.  She is sympathetic because she has mental problems, family problems, and bad friends.  This does not excuse her stealing and being mean to her family.  In contrast, her mother, mother's boyfriend, and her mother's ex-husband come off as somewhat flawed but basically good people.

The movie would have been better if Tracy's troubled and youthful perspective provided some insight into the culture she is growing up in.  Tracy could have channeled her frustration into righting some of the flaws in the adults around her.  But then again, that would be a different movie altogether.

I have to disagree with reviewers who thought the movie was about drugs and sex.  From my standpoint, experimenting with drugs and sex is normal at that age.  The movie is about personal problems causing someone to lose control of her life.  Reckless sex and drug abuse are a tiny part of the larger picture.",1078012800,,1589,4.761904761904762
1970070,1,B00013RC2K,"Am I the only one who thinks this movie was boring? Why was it billed as being so ""important""?  They use that term for any movie that stinks to try to get an audience.
  You'll read reviews that state how this movie portrays the real life of today's 13-year old but it actually PROMOTES this bad life... it doesn't just show it.
  The characters do not really redeem themselves, they just all kind of forgive each other for hurting each other over and over and nothing is resolved very well. The film just runs off the end of the reel and it's over.
  If you want to see kids engaged in physical love, here's your chance. Hollywood just loves to show kids do stuff they shouldn't. Hollywood is addicted to this and they want to make it look normal so more kids will do it so Hollywood will have the chance to get more kids in the Directors' lairs.",1077926400,4,847,4.289308176100629

Hunter is utterly heartbreaking in her performance, and although she does not deserve to win the Oscar for THIS movie,( that honor should go to Patricia Clarkson)she definitely deserved the recognition.

The energy in the quick, low budget, shoot comes through in the film.( On the commentary track, director/cowriter Catherine Hardwicke says Fox Searchlight didn't get involved until after the production was completed. )
Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood, snubbed by Oscar) desperately wants to be accepted by Evie (cowriter Nikki Reed) , the coolest girl at school. Evie accepts Tracy and the two become friends, but Evie introduces Tracy to sex, drugs, and self-destructive behavior. Complicating matters is the fact that Evie has no home life and Tracy's mom (the excellent Holly Hunter) , a recovering addict, can't appreciate the seriousness of what's happening.
THIRTEEN is a snapshot of modern American pre-teen life, and I came away from the film thinking about the importance of communication between parents and children. This is a film that families should watch together. Highly recommended.",1077580800,,970,5.264516129032258
1970074,5,B00013RC2K,"Many have argued that ""Thirteen"" does not delve deep enough into the psyche of the characters, therefore we never understand what exactly it is that drives them over the edge. But the fact that this film was co-written by a thirteen year old (the actress who plays Evie) gives ""Thirteen"" instant credibility.
This is the story of a normal girl, Tracy (played magnificently by Evan Rachel Wood) who befriends the most popular girl in school, Evie. Instantly, Evie is a terrible influence, and the girls start going on shopping sprees funded by stolen money, get high on whatever they can find, drink often, and begin doing things with boys that thirteen year olds should not be doing. Tracy is a tortured soul, angry because her father does not care, because her mother cares too much and because her mom's boyfriend is bad news, according to Tracy. Holly Hunter is awesome as Mel, the mother, playing the character with a naivete thatcomes with a parent hoping their kid is alright. Another pivotal performance is by Tracy's brother, although I can't remember his name right now. His role is much smaller than the other three, but he combines a lack of caring with a big brother instinct that is very real.
This movie could be considered an eye-opener for parents. It seems insane that thirteen year olds would be up to these kinds of things, but we now live in a world where people grow up entirely too quickly, and this movie shows us that in gritty detail. I enjoyed the direction of this film, and it is shaky and grainy in some parts, adding to the realism of the situation.
Maybe we don't know the real reasons why Tracy is so upset with life, and why she choses to do what she does without remorse or any thought of the future, but the fact of the matter is that we don't always know these things, and often there is not even a reason. Simply put, she does do these things to herself, and it matters not what the reasoning is, just that they are done is enough. I can see this movie being pretty scary for parents, and maybe it should be.
This is a great film, better than the other movie of this type, ""Kids"", which was more an expoitation of youth than an analysis.",1077580800,,2174,4.506329113924051

1970077,3,B00013RC2K,"I liked this movie mainly because of the acting performances. Holly Hunter is great as the mom who watches her daughter transform into a minion of hell. Wood (Tracie) is great as the goody two shoes who turns to the dark side, and Reed (Evie) is great as the conniving, evil girl who seduces Wood. All three performance deserve recognintion. The problem I had with this movie is, if this movie were intended to scare kids away from this type of behaviour it certainly doesn't do a good job. Here are some problems I have 1. why does a goody two shoes all of a sudden decide she needs to walk on the wild side with a girl she doesn't know? 2. The two girls are constantly stealing from eveyone but they never caught. 3. Here are two girls who can't weigh more than 80 lbs. apiece and yet they consume all the alcohol and drugs they want without throwing up, without passing out, or without overdosing. 4. They have all the sex they want (at least in Evie's case) without getting pregnant or getting a STD. 5. Finally here are two beautiful scantilly-dressed girls who spend all hours of the night high on drugs, hanging out with boys way older than them, in the seamier parts of town, and they never once get raped, molested, or kidnapped. The only real problem Tracy seems to have is her parents divorce and her mother's new boyfriend. The only person who really suffers in this movie is the mother (at least that part is real). What this movie says to me is its okay to do bad things because its fun, yay! If you want't to see movies that are a bit more realistic watch ""Kids"" and ""Bully.""",1077235200,,1590,4.375
1970078,4,B00013RC2K,"special those of who between 30 and 40 remember so vividly (Scott Baio in ""Stoned"" anyone?).
There is little, on the surface, to differentiate this movie from the other ""What are the kids up to know"" horrorshows a la Brent Easton Ellis's ""Less Than Zero"" (the book NOT the tepid, sanitized movie version).
It's the performances of Ms. Wood and Ms. Hunter than make this far more than a ""troubled teen wake up call"" PSA of 90 minutes.
To go into to much detail would be to rob this fine film of much of its emotional punch.
Note: fathers of young daughters such as my self (mine girl is 4) should pay close attention to the clever way these 7th graders hide their hooker clothes for, ah, assignations with boys they barely know.
One bright spot I will reveal: a man, presented with these two Lolitas actually resists temptation and behaves as a man should.
The major criticism I have of this film and the reason I would rate it a B in stead of a A is the one dimenstional nature of the Evie character.  This is not to criticize the actor (who also co-wrote the flick with the director; never more has my parents dictim, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU KNOW BUT WHO YOU KNOW been proven more true than Ms. Nikki's odyssey) who shows chops many our so-called ""thespians"" haven't learned in decades working at their craft than this young ""natural"" brings to the screen.
In Evie we are given little motivation, other than an airhead caretaker cousin, for her evil behavior.  And evil she is.  Cruel as well.  I'm sure for most of us junior high was a cruel experience.  The taunts, name calling, labelling and tremendous pressure to homogenize all brought me chills of memory.
The one odd thing was the kids in the movie didn't seem to know how to walk down crowded hallways; it was the only useful skill I acquired in 13 years of public schools.  If they can't even convey that school, the education industry really has hit nadir.
Back to Evie.  The ""reasons"" she gives are, in fact, lies or exaggerations.  But we aren't given any real reason that this young girl would suddenly begin dealing drugs, having sex, stealing and the other attendant ""risky behavior"" she seduces the all too willing Tracey.
Evan Rachel Wood's character, on the other hand, is a fully fleshed out person.  We get to know and understand the alienation, rage and loneliness that tears this girl apart.
In the end, the director and writers leave us as they left Tracey and Mel: shattered.
No happy/Hollywood/Danielle Steel/Lifetime ending is tacked on.  As a great writer once wrote: books either tie up the loose ends or else they just stop.  This movie does the latter.  It just stops, leaving us almost as wrecked as Tracey and her Mom and wondering, just as they must have been, how the hell a society gets to the point where drug dealing and oral sex are ""normal"" behavior for 13 year old girls?
As will all great works of art, the questions ""thirteen"" asks are far more important than any answers--inevitably pablum--that could have been presented.  Like life, this movie leaves us with the messy, squalid consequences of our actions.
But I do not think this is, ultimately, a pessimistic movie.  Where there is love, there is hope.  It can't solve our problems, but without we have only the empty despair of Tracey's ultimate breakdown. And that may be all the answer we need.
PS********************************
There is one scene that I should mention that is totally inappropriate for children.  It concerns a wholly unecessary joke about oral sex.  It was in context, but still, in my opinion needless.  And, it's not even a good joke.  Still, how the writers could have ever imagined having a 13 year old character utter it is beyond me.
I'm not a prude or a fan of censorship, but I would not let a child under sixteen or seventeen see this movie.  In sticking to the truth so rigorously, this movie good provide a sheen of glamor to some extremely stupid behavior.  Parents should keep this in mind.",1077062400,,3969,4.6253561253561255

Whether the blame  lies on the disappearance of traditional family structure/values or the bombarding of adult images via innumerable media outlets, the fact of the matter is that 13-year olds look like 18 year olds.
And start acting like it.
This film depicts one girl's harrowing descent into premature 'adulthood"", for no other reason than to be ""popular"". The two leads (Wood and Reed) are note perfect. Wood goes from a pig-tailed innocent to a pierced tortured young adult effortlessly. This is an actress with range, and uses it fearlessly.
Reed (also co-writer, which is a little disturbing...) is scary as the seductive Evie. She's manipulative and evil in whole new ways seen in children. The world of drugs. sex, disrespect of self and others...she's Wood's escort into this particular hell. Some viewers may be uncomfortable with the brazen sexuality she exudes, but I feel that's totally intentional. The filmmakers are trying to shake us up.
Holly Hunter has been justifiably lauded for her performance as the mom. It can be seen as a case of a parent who sees a child slipping through her fingers, and may not have the faculties to stop it.

1970083,4,B00013RC2K,"Co-Written by one of the actresses in the film as a sort of auto-biographical account of her thirteen year old life.
Evan Rachel Wood stars as Tracy, a seventh grader over-influenced by her new friend Evie. Evie is played by Nikki Reed, who was the real life Tracy. Its very interesting to look at the film and realise that Nikki is playing the very character that pushed her over the edge, in fact its almost disturbing.
The film features superb lead acting by Wood and Holly Hunter, who plays the most realistic 'movie mother' i've seen in a while. Supporting acting comes with Reed, who knows her character better than any mere actress ever could, and plays her with cruel sincerity, and Jeremy Sisto (Six Feet Under), who is the troubled Brady, Hunter's boyfriend, who is much more dedicated to her than his actions might dictate.
Overall the film is a veritable knockout. The acting is superb, as is the casting. The only complaint here is the storyline is VERY overused. However, this 'coming-of-age-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks' tale is not often painted in so stark a light. The dark nature of the script, coupled with the knowledge that this DID happen to a real person (who, for extra emphasis, appears in the film) glosses over the tired nature of the teen angst drama. But better yet, the 'teens' in this film are for once played by actors that actually move within their age groups. Wood is barely sixteen, a far cry from the twenty-somethings that would normally be expected in this style of film. Reed is eighteen, which allows her to bring the maturity and superiority to her role that is required. Its also quite impressive that a movie this cathartic was written by someone who's probably still in highschool. Reed has truly come far from her real 'Thirteen' experience.
Wood, in turn, has also come a long way from the first role i saw her in, as Sandra Bullock's oldest daughter in 'Practical Magic', as is evidenced by her stellar performance here. I left the film overtly satisfied, and excited to see more of all the castmembers. Moviegoers and art-film connoisseurs: this ones a keeper.",1076716800,2,2113,4.823691460055096

1970085,5,B00013RC2K,"This movie paints a realistic window into the scary reality of our kids lives.
Evan Rachel Ward plays Tracy, a ordinary thirteen-year-old girl who wants to fit in with the ""cool"" kids at her middle school. This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self-mutilation and all the other methods of traditional teenage rebellion. Tracy comes from a broken home, although her mother, Mel, played by Holly Hunter, seems like a reasonably caring and open-minded individual, even though, in the way she acts and dresses, she seems like little more than a teenager herself. It is this lack of a adult figure in her life that makes Tracy turn to other vices and influences around her.
Hardwicke has provided a raw, up front straight forward picture of teenage values in our modern culture. The film doesn't speak for all teenagers, of course, but it does speak for alot of them, narrowing in on the kinds of dysfunctional lives so many of them are forced to live through on their path to adulthood. first time director hardwicke never plays down the graphic detail the realities of Tracy's life, making us see how the need for peer acceptance, an unstable family life and a permissive, valueless society all contribute to the problems children like Tracy face in coming to terms with who they really are.
Wood provides stunning believable portrait of a young girl in search of her sense of self and her own unique identity unfortunately she tries to find herself through destructive behavior..
 Nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self-destruction. Her performance is gripping ,Atonshing is that reed also co wrote the script for Thirteen.
 Mel won't be winning any Mother of the Year contests any time soon, but she is a caring person who can't understand what is happening to the daughter she loves. Holly Hunter gives the performance of her career, making the mother neither a hero nor a villain, just a recognizable human being.
Hardwicke has chosen to employ a shakey, handheld camera technique which helps make this film seem like a piece of reality.
""Thirteen"" is a gritty and some times distrubing film on an important topic, a topic that alot of teens are screaming to let the world know. Hardwicke and reeds film is the just a film but to alot of teens it is a reality. so parents sit down with your kids and watch this film.",1076630400,,2424,4.782816229116945

The critics, who can sometimes be a bit biased, we right on the money here.  I'll have to say, Thirteen was one of the best movies I've seen in recent years.  The acting was so good, that at times, I swore it was real.  The storyline jumped around a little bit, and sometimes you really didn't know what was going on, but it all came together perfectly in the end.
I see no reason why this movie shouldn't have won ""Best Picture"".  It's that good.",1076371200,2,578,4.218181818181818
1970088,4,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" begins with literal punches being thrown--best friends Tracy and Evie are slugging each other to prove how numb they are from the huffing they've been doing in Tracy's bedroom--and continues with an unrelenting aggressiveness until its penultimate, quiet moment.
I don't have any children myself, and my teenage years were nothing like what's depicted on screen here, but I have a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach that ""Thirteen"" is not as over the top as some would like to believe.  I only hope parents are watching this film, though as is typical, movies like this preach to the choir, and those who should be seeing them aren't.
This film is visceral in the same way ""Requiem for a Dream"" is, though Catherine Hardwicke keeps a tighter rein on her project than Darren Aronofsky did his.  She indulges in some of the same stylistic excesses--the frenzied camera work, the digitized color, the pounding soundtrack--but they don't overwhelm her actors.  And indeed, it's the actors who deserve the lion's share of praise for this film.  Evan Rachel Wood absolutely astounds as Tracy.  I know vaguely of the T.V. show she starred in, but I wouldn't have been able to pick her out of a crowd before seeing her here.  Her performance is raw and scary--I don't know what real-life resources this young actress is drawing from, but she convinced me that she was a teenager teetering on the brink of disaster.  Nikki Reed, who co-wrote the screenplay, is very good as well, but has a decidedly more supporting, less involved role.  And Holly Hunter, a reliable veteran, delivers the goods as well as Tracy's mom.  Her final emotional show-down with Tracy is one of the most affecting coups de theatre I saw this year.
Hardwicke's use of enhanced color is unnecessary and distracting---it's too obvious and stylized and blunts the effects of the film's realistic approach. Ditto the MTV editing style---at times this movie looks like a Noxzeema commercial from Hell.  This is obviously intentional---we are meant to understand that these girls are only trying to live up to expectations places upon them by an all-pervading consumer culture that demands perfection.  But I wouldn't have minded a more subtle approach to those conclusions--I don't need them crammed down my throat.  However, as I said, this quality might ruin a lesser film, but doesn't this one because of its phenomenal performances and genuine commitment to the tragic story it wants to tell.

Of course reality does have a tendency to creep in. I mean what do you expect from a dysfunctional family in the throes of trying their darndest to overcome drug or alcohol addiction. Did you expect the kids to be knitting sweaters while mom bakes golden crips apple pies. I think not!
Thirteen takes a young, grade seven, thirteen (of course) year old girl, Tracy, as she decides to leave aside her teddy bears and fall into the trap of conforming to 'hip' peer pressure. The problem for Tracy is that to get that peer approval she yearns for requires her to let one of the newfound friends, Evie, to latch on. Evie, practically moves into Tracy's house while begins to spin her hedonistic web around her new victim 'de jour' ...... Evie of course is no more and no less than one of the world great users and leeches ......
In a matter of months Tracy's life begins to unravell before our eyes as she now drinks, steals, does drugs, looses her virginity, lies, cheats, fails in school  ...... and last but no least begins body piercing, tatooing and self mutilation with half hearted attemps to get attention by trying to commit suicide....
Yes quite a busy four months of the first semester in grade seven I might add ...

1970091,3,B00013RC2K,"***1/2 Catherine Hardwicke's harrowingly realistic film ""Thirteen"" paints an unflinching, unsparing and uncompromising portrait of an American teenager circa 2003.
Evan Rachel Ward, who is 15 in real life, plays Tracy, a fairly ordinary thirteen-year-old girl whose life falls to pieces when she decides she wants to fit in with the ""cool"" kids at her middle school.  This, of course, involves sex, drugs, body piercing, shoplifting, self-mutilation and all the other accoutrements associated with traditional teenage rebellion.  Tracy predictably comes from a broken home, although her mother, Mel, played by Holly Hunter, seems like a reasonably caring and open-minded individual, even though, in dress and demeanor, she seems like little more than a teenager herself.  It is this lack of a truly adult figure in her life that makes Tracy a perfect candidate for what happens to her.
Hardwicke has provided a raw, close-to-the-bone assessment of teenage values in our modern culture.  The film doesn't pretend to speak for all teenagers, of course, but it does speak for a goodly number of them, zeroing in on the kinds of dysfunctional lives so many of them are forced to live through on their path to adulthood.  The director never shies away from showing us in graphic detail the realities of Tracy's life, making us see how the need for peer acceptance, an unstable family life and a permissive, valueless society all contribute to the problems children like Tracy face in coming to terms with who they really are.
Wood provides a fully rounded, believable portrait of a young girl in search of her identity and Nikki Reed offers superb support as Evie, the wild and wildly popular girl who puts Tracy on the path to gradual self-destruction.  Mel won't be winning any Mother of the Year contests any time soon, but she is a caring person who can't understand what is happening to the daughter she loves.  Holly Hunter hits all the right notes in the role, making the mother neither a hero nor a villain, just a recognizable human being.
Hardwicke has chosen to employ a jittery, handheld camera technique which helps to underline the unfiltered reality of the piece.  In this, her first film as a director (she has previously been an art director and a production designer), Hardwicke proves herself a talent well worth watching.
""Thirteen"" is a grim film on an important topic, one that cries out to be seen - though you may need to watch ""Spellbound"" as a much needed restorative and antidote immediately afterwards.",1076198400,,2525,4.995238095238095

She turned me to drugs and the wilder way of life.  And I won't deny it, I had SO much fun.  But this movie showed me what it could've turned to if we hadn't gotten in a fight.  We WERE on that same exact path.  Although my friendship with her wasn't as seriously as Tracy and Evie's, it was close to it.  This is my all time favorite movie.",1076198400,,466,4.0
1970093,5,B00013RC2K,"Well, that may not be my name, but it is my experience. I cannot believe the number of reviews here that call her story ""unrealistic."" Rather, I can believe it, because people outside of it do not WANT to see it.
I started the 7th grade at 12 yrs old. By the time I turned 13 a few months later, I had lived much of ""Thirteen""s storyline. I had a best friend (strikingly similar even in appearance to Evie in the film) with whom I started the sick downward spiral that is the film's focus. I was silently riveted by this movie every second, because every single element was perfectly real, just the sort of feeling I remember.
To those who would discount the film because of Tracy's amazingly quick bond with Evie, don't. I haven't seen a ""right"" explanation of why Tracy got in thick with Evie on this site yet. The truth is, it doesn't have to be because your home life is bad. It doesn't have to be because you want to be cool. For me, I started this road and there was no hesitation, I didn't do it to rebel or escape but because there was such a strange mix of opportunity, newness, and raw emotion that these things became possible and, in some sick way, inviting. And no, my mother was not neglectful, proof that Tracy's mother cannot be solely blamed for what happened.
The truth is, this film is real, as perfectly real as it gets, especially for me. My ""Evie"" friend went on down that road even after I had done my share of reforming, and made a new best friend, and, before they reached high school, they had both been found out and were seperated by their terrified parents. This is a real story.
And, to the reviewer who ranted about how horrible the girls were, let me say this -- it's true. They were horrible. I was selfish and cruel and did things I hated myself for for a long time afterwards. But it is only a time, not a lifetime... you are disgustingly wrong if you think that these girls could never become decent women. You are very, very wrong.
In any case, this is a wonderful film. Evan Rachel Wood is astonishingly raw and I love her for that. But, if you watch this film and aren't touched, it's not the film's fault.",1076198400,2,2145,4.311881188118812
1970094,5,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" is a highly intense drama worthy of watching.  The hardhitting scenes in this wrongfully underrated movie keep everything realistic looking and keep audiences eyes wide open.  Its daring theme earns the cast and crew trememdous respect for graphically exploring what few other moviemakers have.  The research of such issues are present: drug use, theft, out-of-control behavior, and many more all from teenagers.  The emotional aspect never fades for a second, keeping audiences interested the whole time.  This brilliant plot is loosely based on actress Nikki Reed's, who plays Evie, life.  Knowing this, the graphic nature becomes more necessary to inform audiences of teenage realities.  The actors offer their own emotional standing to the movie.  Evan Rachel Wood's Golden Globe nominated (Best Actress) performance proves that she's one of the few child actors with talent.  Her despliction of an out-of-control thirteen-year-old, Tracy, places her in higher territory as an actress.  Her intensity shines in every scene.  Holly Hunter's Oscar nominated performance (Best Supporting Acress) is one of her best roles in years.  She beautifully desplicts the stresses and turbulances as Tracy's mother struggling to keep her family together.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  ""Thirteen"" is a great movie for those looking for heartpounding drama.  This will surely please many audiences.",1076198400,,1425,5.624413145539906
1970095,4,B00013RC2K,"Honestly, I was surprised. I thought this movie was going to just be another cliched, by the book bad-girl drags good-girl down into a torrent of drugs, sex and rock-n-roll(or in this case, hip hop) with ""shocking"" twists to make it seem edgy. In a majority of the professional reviews i've read on this film, the probably over-thirty reviewers have usually asserted that this film did,in fact,use shock over substance. But, as a girl barely eighteen, I have to make a rebuttal. I saw myself, and many of my seventh-grade friends reflected in the characters of Tracey and Evie. Wake up and smell the yummy coffee,my sweets,Thirteen-year-olds all across the country ARE doing drugs,commitig illegal acts and having sex and they aren't naive about any of it. So know that the language,mannerisms and actions of Thirteen's characters aren't plastic and pay attention to the plot. It's important. We have Tracey,blond and sweet(of course) and somewhat innocent but obviously more socialy advanced and wild than her tame book-worm friends. She befriends Evie,the wiser,expiranced one by stealing a woman's cash-packed wallet after she is mocked for not shoplifting with Evie and her snobby friend. Evie soon begins spending copious amounts of time at Tracey's house, and as Tracey and Evie grow closer, Tracey grower farther from her mother who Tracey can't stand to see back with her junkie boyfriend. As the plot slowly unfolds,we see that Evie is in love with Tracey in the rare and very subtle tender parts of the film and when Evie convinces Tracey to kiss her ""for practise"" it is obviously a seduction. Athough all of it is only implied,Tracey seems to unconsciously fall in love with Evie also,further estranging herself from her family and old friends and attaching herself closer and closer to Evie. Evie also confesses to Tracey's mother the sexual and physical abuse she suffered through when she was younger and becomes close to her in a mother-daughter way but simultaniously also appears to have some sexual feelings towards the older woman. Evie  wants to openly love and be in a relationship with Tracey and have Tracey's mother accept this so they could all live together as a rather unusual, but happy psedu-family, something Evie never had. But Evie never falls out of her old behavior and her randomly sadistic nature rips at Tracey and her self-mutilation problem grows. Evie becomes worse and worse near the end of the film,purposely hurting Tracey for no reason. At the climax of the film, when Evie is in trouble with her flighty aunt, she betrays Tracey by ratting her out- even exposing  Tracey's ultimate secret, self-multilation, which she had discovered when she cuddled and kissed the sleeping Tracey much earlier in the film. Even though Evie's actions are under-handed and nasty instead of villifying her it only makes her more pitiable. All of her emotional damage, carefully revealed in the film, have made her so jaded that she cannot bring herself to trust anyone-despite Tracey's devotion to her and their shared affection for each other, she just cannot bring herself to be put in a vulnerable position.",1076112000,,3137,5.030769230769231

Hopefully from this movie parents will learn a little bit about the pressures of being a teen today and what is going on when they can't be with their children. People can not say that this stuff never happens and that it's just hollywood making everything more dramatic because it's based on a person's life.

1970097,2,B00013RC2K,"First glance of the glowing reviews given to this particular piece would have you believe it is a reliable account of the dangers of ""growing up"", indeed the tag line gives a good preview of what is to come by mentioning how growing up is a dangerous thing to do, but it seems more dangerous to actually sit through this movie and expect the performances to come across as realistic and ""everyday"" life of normal teenagers.
The movie begins with the predictable shock attempt, featuring the movie's two leading ladies Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed (who co-wrote the script based on her own life) getting high off aerosol fumes and smacking each other senseless because they couldn't feel their faces.  Once again, congratulations to the Hollywood moguls who feel drug abuse is the only complexity in a teenage life.  And then, the focus of the movie shifts from the scene to ""four months earlier"" in which a fast paced set of events, with little in-depth explaination, begin to unravel.  Tracy (Evan) is the traditional good girl from a broken home who is unable to deal with the fact her father was replaced by a cocaine addicted ""boyfriend"" her mother seems to fool around with on a nearly endless basis, and although the main reviews seem not to focus on this point, it is her hatred of that particular man that begins the events in the movie.  Almost every time you catch her interactions with her down-on-her-luck mother's boyfriend, you'll catch a new change in the character of Tracy, always for the worse.
Suffice to say, the movie was predictable. Attempts at shock value with drugs, cutting, interracial sex and a superb show of two under eighteen year olds seemingly having sex with anything that walked really showed this movie was anything but a typical teenage day in the park.  Far from describing real teenagers, the movie focused on a minority suffering from some of the same situations as Tracy and her low income broken home.  So much was left without explaination, Noelle for example.  Noelle simply vanished after being her friend only to show up towards the end for a cameo in the science project scene? Why didn't she attempt to help her friend out of the mess she was seeing her become? And of course, the end of the movie simply became one gigantic metaphor for the roller coaster world Tracy had ended up in.  Dramatic, definately.  Good acting? I'd say these two have a huge Hollywood future.  I'd simply suggest Nikki Reed stick to the big screen as an actress and away from the script.  Predictability in these movies tends to take away from the dramatic ending, similiar to Requiem For A Dream, that shows the realization of how destroyed a formerly innocent girl had become inside and out.  The final scream in the merry-go-round was the ""end"", and thankfully so as there was very little originality and a lot of stereotypical characterization (i.e: evil black teenage thugs, broken down poverty stricken mother in Holly Hunter who seems to just let her daughter suffer until the very end, drug addicted boyfriend/stepfather) that deprived the movie of truly becoming a classic.  It'll open your eyes, but but by the time the scene comes to an anti-climatic close 100 minutes later, you'll wish you kept them shut.",1076112000,4,3247,4.797491039426523

This is an excellent independent film with glowing performances from the entire cast.  But there are two, in particular, that drive this unnerving film home.  Evan Rachel Wood, in an auspicious performance, gives a powerful turn as a 13-year-old suddenly overwhelmed with puberty and peer pressure.  Her acting alone is reason enough to see this, but then Holly Hunter matches her scene for scene with a subtle, extraordinary performance.  On a personal note, this film provoked memories of alcohol abuse in my own family, making it all the more striking.  I can't say that I would recommend buying this.  I couldn't imagine anyone wanting to watch this disheartening tale of disintegrating youth more than once.  However, the acting is really good and the documentary style in which this film was shot made me feel more like a voyeur than an audience member, leaving me drained with the experience.  The final scene in which Ms. Wood is holding onto the outside of a playground merry-go-round and then suddenly screams is a perfect metaphor for the beginning of adolesence: confusing and frightening, exhilerating and dizzying.

This film has been done time after time. In black and white it was ""The Days Of Wine and Roses"" and ""Heroin Fiends"". In the eighties it was ""Less Than Zero"". The plot never changes. The only changes are the clothes, hair and soundtrack.

Thirteen is a bold, gut-wrenching film about the crumbling American family and the current generation of overexposure, MTV, reality shows, and disillusionment. Tracy is astonishingly portrayed by Evan Rachel Wood who gives such an amazing performance it should take child-acting to new heights. Evie is portrayed by Nikki Reed (who also co-penned the script) is a vibrant screen newcomer. The Oscar nominated Holly Hunter ,as Mel, is brilliant as a bohemian, alcoholic single mom who watches her daughter Tracy descend into self-destruction right before her eyes. The director Catherine Hardwicke directs the film with relentless, edgy appeal giving the film it's power and drive.
Although most critics give the film massive acclaim, some have shuddered at the shocking horror of the explicit nature of the teen lifestyles of Thirteen and many perhaps deny the possible accuracy of the film. ""Are kids really that bad?"" No, not all kids are drug-users dealers hypersexed or criminals but one must admit with a generation raised on MTV and Hollywood scandal , where many kids have to go to school in fear if their classmates may kill them, a generation where many believe oral sex isn't as intimate as kissing, or being a ""pimp"" or a ""thug"" is the true aspiration of life...the mood of the film is an unflinching cinematic opus to a generation sadly spiralling out of control.",1076025600,41,1598,4.9664179104477615

This is a pungently real, throbbing two hours of the descent of a 'normal' but vulnerable thirteen year old 7th grader (Evan Rachel Wood as Tracy), the daughter of a divorced, recovering alcoholic mother (Holly Hunter) who loves her children and supports them by working as a hairdresser in their home, who succumbs to the need of peer acceptance by aligning with the most 'with it' girl in her class (Nikki Reed's Evie), and moves from normalcy into drugs, crime, self abuse, and rage against the adult world. There is no comic relief or any relief at all in this ring of Dante's Inferno and that is as it should be, Co-writers Nikki Reed (yes, the beautiful young accomplice in the film) and Catherine Hardwicke have written a script that makes us feel we are neighbors unwillingly privy to the madness of folks next door. The language is raw, the drug scenes are realistic, and the sex scenes are gratefully fogged over by the fine cinematographer using the blur effect to tell much more than playing actual witness could show. This is a very fine, though very tough to watch, film about a real problem that surrounds us. There is no pat ending, only a hint that something positive has resulted from this assault on our senses. Much of this is due to the fine direction by Catherine Hardwicke, but the power comes from extraordinary performances Evan Rachel Wood (why did the Academy single out Keisha Castle-Hughes and ignore Wood if they were looking for a young actress' performance?), Holly Hunter, Nikki Reed, Jeremy Sisto, Deborah Unger (becoming one of the finer character actors around), and all the cast. This is a
a film that deserves everyone's attention: how else can we develop awareness of why drugs and peer pressure are such demons in placing our youth on such a terrifyingly intrepid battleground?

1970102,4,B00013RC2K,"A gut-wrenching look at the pressures and temptations that face teenagers in the new millenium.  In a family fractured by divorce and drug use, Evan Rachel Woods' character is seduced by the oppressive power of peer pressure and need for acceptance.  In the space of 100 minutes, her character arc goes from sweet, needy pre-teen to promiscuous, pierced, drug abusing pal to Evie (Nikki Wood, who apparently co-wrote the drama based on her own experiences) to damaged, jaded teen.
As the parent of a young daughter, it was a good cautionary tale to remind me how careful I will need to be when my daughter reaches that age.  I encourage other parents of pre-teens to also view this film and stay involved in the lives of your children.  It also reminds us that too much freedom is not always a good thing for pre-teens to have.  Rules are important, and parents should not be afraid to say ""no"" to their children when the children are engaged in the kinds of self-destructive behavior this film portrays.
Powerfully, although somewhat unevenly acted at times, this film is definitely not a feel-good film.  The tragedy of the film is increased by its realistic depiction of dysfunctional relationships, and although the film is more of a character study than a story, it is definitely worth watching, especially for parents with pre-teens and teenagers.  Perhaps it will open a few eyes as to the pressures children face at the start of the 21st century.",1075852800,4,1454,4.815261044176707
1970103,4,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" is an emotionally devastating movie. Some girls handle puberty fairly smoothly. For them the transition period from child to young woman is an interesting, informative journey. Other girls, like Tracy [Evan Rachel Wood] in this movie, find the experience so traumatizing that they crash and burn. A form of madness sets in that affects not only themselves but their families and friends as well.
Tracy lives in a lower middle-class suburban home with her mom, Melanie [Holly Hunter], and her slightly older brother, Mason [Brady Corbet]. Her real father could care less about what happens with the family. At her middle school, she attempts to make friends with the beautiful Evie [Nikki Redd], but is rejected as being too childish. Tracy quickly remakes herself by trashing her wardrobe and shoplifting things for Evie. Soon Tracy and Evie are best friends and Melanie, a recovering drug addict, is slow to see the changes in Tracy. When Melanie lets her drug addicted boyfriend move back in, Tracy's rebellion only increases. We also see that Evie is from a dysfunctional family. Together Tracy and Evie go on a rampage of drugs, alcohol, body piercing and promiscuous sex. It is important to note that. while the girls come from chaotic, broken homes, not all teens who get into serious trouble come from such backgrounds.
""Thirteen"" does not always work. Some of its characters' actions and reactions sometime seem a little farfetched. Where it does succeed, it does so brilliantly. It definitely gets points for being a brave little movie. Young teens and sexuality is not a subject many American filmmakers are willing to deal with, as if `sex and drugs with minors' and `sex and drugs among minors' is the same thing.",1075766400,,1736,5.010380622837371

What so great about this film is that  the actors don't make drugs, sex, etc. look fun it truely looks frightning and that sends out a message to all teens ! Another great thing about this film are the characters that look like there 18 and screw up their lives and there only thirteen thats another reason why this film is schocking . I recomend this to all teens it has a great plot ( tracy a 13 year old girl wants to become popular and with evie a thirteen year old with no mom and bad influences in her life she will become popular but the consequences are too ricky but does tracy care ? no!) and even greater actors and message!

1970105,4,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen is dark ""coming of age"" film about Tracy's transformation from being an A-student to an F-student.  It all begins when Tracy returns to school in seventh grade with her friends where they notice the attention that one of the ""cool"" girl's receives from the boys.  This attention is something that Tracy perceives as positive, and something she would like to receive as well.  She is also ridiculed for the clothes she is wearing, which is hurting her self-esteem.  At home Tracy's mother (Holly Hunter) is more of a friend than a mother.  Therefore, Tracy seeks out the ""cool"" girl, Evie, who offers Tracy the affection and care that she wants.  However, Evie's coolness brings Tracy down on a dangerous path where she seeks out self-reassurance through drugs, petty-crime, eating disorders, and other delinquent behaviors.  Thirteen is a strong film that can be compared to similar films such as Pixote (1981), Kids (1995), L.I.E. (2001), and City of God (2001), which all deal with children and teenagers that have been mislead onto a harmful path in the beginning of their lives.  In Thirteen, the cast brings out solid performances to the screen which colors the characters and enhances the realistic environment in which Tracy is growing up.  The mise-en-scene and the outstanding cinematography adds extra layers to the film that boosts the overall cinematic experience and it offers a solid cinematic experience to the audience as they can follow Tracy's struggles with growing up.",1075593600,,1497,5.102459016393443
1970106,5,B00013RC2K,"Thirteen exhibits teenage life perfectly.  Every second of this film plays out the real-life feelings, desires, and attitudes of a teenager.  Evan Rachel Wood does a fantastic job of portraying Tracy, and deserved her Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.  Holly Hunter does an amazing job of showing what parents of teenagers go through, and how tough it truly is.  She also deserved her Golden Globe AND Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Rounding out the cast of main characters is Nikki Reed as Evie, who also wrote the film.  Her script is sheer brilliance and is ultimately an eye-opener for all.  And last but not least, Catherine Hardwicke does a great job of directing, and the use of only a digital camera makes the film seem so much more real.
Tracy as entered the seventh grade and quickly feels that she does not have the right friends.  This movie shows how the desire to be accepted is so sick.  Why do teens have to feel accepted by the popular kids to live and feel happy.  The film also portrays teenage rebellion to the max and shows perfectly how badly it affects our caring parents.  This film is riveting, and very very effective in all ways.  It makes everyone, not just us teens, realizes how different our generation is from previous ones.  Everyone should see this movie, because it will open the eyes of parents and make teens realize how they destroy one another.",1075507200,,1407,4.717213114754099
1970107,4,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" is a tale of a 13 year old girl that becomes friends with the wrong person and goes on a downward spiral through the world of drugs, sex and self-destruction. It's a well scripted, well woven drama that tugs at the heart and the mind. Sometimes, difficult to watch, but rewarding as well.
The thing to remember about this film is the acting and the script. Very well done on both accounts. I escpecially like the performance by Holly Hunter, who I felt, was very properly cast as the young girl's single mother. And brought quite a bit of realism to the whole thing. The acting on all the other fronts are quite good with the character of Tracy leading the pack.
The directing here has a very arthouse feel to it, which suits this movie just fine, I thought. Overall, a very realistic and entertaining film about a chunk of these people's lives. The only thing I thought would have been better is if the director took the experiences that Tracy had a little deeper and explained her state of mind and emotions more at the time of the incident, but again, I'm nit picking here.
If you're into real life dramas with a volume of risque material, then you have found a winner. Pick up Thirteen.",1075507200,,1201,4.488584474885845
1970108,5,B00013RC2K,"I know people say this movie seems to be overexaggerated but I beg to differ. I am now 20 years old and this movie was almost a spitting image of my life growing up. Believe it or not, this stuff (sex, drugs, cutting) does start to show its face at 13. One thing I must add though, if you or someone you are watching it with cuts themselves, it can be a very triggering movie to watch so be careful (the scenes are pretty graphic). The DVD is awesome, comes with both full screen and widescreen. Special features are pretty good you get the Making of, theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and the commentary.
Even if this movie didn't pertain (sp?) to me, I would still have enjoyed watching it because it was intense. Who can honestly say they never wanted to be someone else? I believe that part was the truest of true.. Tracy saw who she wanted to be and is one of the many adolescent girls willing to risk it all to become that.",1075507200,,931,4.295454545454546
1970109,5,B00013RC2K,"Having just watched Thirteen for the first time on DVD, I have to share my response with Amazon.com customers.  Why?  Because, quite simply, this is perhaps the single most accurate portrait of contemporary adolescence I've ever seen. Director Catherine Hardwicke tells her story of a 13-year-old girl, Tracy, and her descent into drug abuse, self-mutilation, theft and promiscuity, with a clear-eyed intimacy that neither glamorizes nor preaches.
This is an important movie that kids and parents can watch and discuss together. Unlike the ""just say no"" propaganda of government fiction, Thirteen doesn't lie. Instead, it tells difficults truths -- that adults can be flawed, imperfect, and sometimes just plain wrong, that it's natural to wish to alter our bodies and minds when we cannot change what's outside, and that love, courage and faith can still survive in the midst of this, our very human predicament. The acting is first-rate:  Holly Hunter does a stunning job as Tracy's mom, a recovering alcoholic prone to some bad choices herself; cowriter Nicki Reed is disturbingly convincing as Tracy's best galpal and bad influence, and Evan Rachel Wood turns in an unforgettable Tracy.  It's harrowing stuff and hard to watch at times, but you will not regret it.",1075507200,2,1268,5.200980392156863
1970110,4,B00013RC2K,"i have never been a teenage girl, beset by peer pressure.  likewise, i have never been a heroin dealer, a diet pill addict, or an elderly woman dependent on amphetamines as a catalyst to the love of son and peers.  but, with confidence, i assert that every young person in America, every old person, and everyone who would not put themselves in one of these categories should see ""Thirteen,"" for the same reasons they should see ""Requiem for a Dream.""
""Requiem"" repulsed me from addictive substances more that eight years of D.A.R.E in elementary and middle scholl..  Likewise, I saw ""Thirteen"" today. The credits had not yet stopped rolling, and I began to write.  This film, FILM, bears notice as an outstanding screenplay, which penetrates to the heart of an outsider's desire to Fit In.
Meet Tracy.  An honor student, like so many of us were.  Her mother's child.  Again, as I was, perhaps you were.  The bane of Mason's, her elder sibling's, existence.
Meet Evie.  Evie is Cool.  Not through any quality of her own.  In fact, if I may foreshadow, the more we learn about Evie, we learn that nothing intrinsic to Evie makes her admirable.  But the others, her peers, see her as such, and nothing more matters.
Evie mocks Tracy.  Tracy seeks Evie's approval.  She wins it through a single unethical act.  But what matters ethics when acceptance hangs in the balance?  Once Tracy is admitted into Evie's confidence, Tracy rebels in small ways.  Each is justifiable as a reaction to a wrong done to Tracy, a minor act of rebellion.  Tracy balances the karmic scale:  she pierces her navel as a reaction to her mother's boyfriend, a former addict and a parolee.  Knowing Evie or not, one believes that the world owes Tracy something for this.
Do not dismiss Tracy's mother's boyfriend yet.  His self-knowledge serves as lynchpin for the film.
Mason's reaction to Evie, in particular, gives another dimension to this story.  In the beginning, he delights in her; upon realizing what her influence has done to his baby sister, he disgusts in her.
Of the many, many remarkable aspects of this screenplay -- to recap, its truth, its genuineness-- most remarkable, it was written by Nikki Reed, whom viewers will know only as Evie.  This young woman has taken an objective view of what, for any woman, would have to be a subjective, er, subject.
See ""Thirteen.""  Then form your own point of view.",1075420800,3,2391,4.761557177615572
1970111,5,B00013RC2K,"Evan Rachel Wood continues to make her bid to be the Jodie Foster of her generation in ""Thirteen,"" a harrowing film about a good little girl gone horribly bad.  Wood is Tracy, a seventh grader who lives with her single mom (Holly Hunter), a hairdresser who works out of the home.  Tracy dreams of being cool, just like Evie (Nikki Reed), and when the opportunity comes to ingratiate herself with the cool girls, Tracy takes it and quickly moves from shoplifting, low-rise jeans and hoochie tops to drugs, body piercings, bad boys, oral sex, and worse.  Evie even moves into Tracy's home, and it becomes clear that this is a troubled girl who has made shoplifting, drugs, and sex part of her daily routine.
The script for ""Thirteen"" was written in six days by director Catherine Hardwicke and Nikki Reed.  Hardwicke had dated Reed's divorced dad and having known Nikki since she was a little girl was distressed when the kid turned 13 and starting having problems (problems like what happens to Tracy in this film).  Hardwicke suggested Nikki keep a journal and intervened in the young girl's life, taking her to museums and exposing her to the larger world.  However, it was Nikki's journey through the dark side that serves as the basis for this film.
The result is a story that retains its rawness even as we are mesmerized by the performances of the three female leads.  For every ""cool"" scene, such as when Evie dressed for a date by taking off her skirt, moving her tank top down as a skirt and adding a new blouse, there are scenes that no kid is going to want to emulate, as when Tracy starts cutting herself.  Meanwhile, her mother, a recovering alcoholic, finds herself helpless to do anything about her daughter's death spiral once she finally notices the radical changes that Tracy has undergone.  It is not that Melanie does not care, but that she is powerless.  Having been abandoned by her husband, Melanie finds her daughter has no use for her either.
The big question with ""Thirteen"" is whether young teenage girls who get to watch this deservedly R-rated film would understand that it was a warning or whether they would just filter the horror story through the prism of their adolescent notions of coolness.  Hardwicke follows Tracy's descent but never buys into the idea it is a good thing.  This is made clear by the opening scene where the two girls, while doing drugs, have made their faces numb so that they do not feel anything and starting hitting each other in the face, laughing hysterically all the time.  The point of the opening scene is clear: Tracy does not know what she is doing to herself.
Hardwicke won the Director's Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Hunter is up for an Oscar, and Wood was nominated for a Golden Globe.  ""Entertainment Weekly"" argued that Wood should receive serious consideration to become the youngest nominee the Best Actress Oscar in history and surprisingly that indeed happen this year, except that the nomination went to Keisha Castle-Hughes for ""Whale Rider.""  Special mention should be made of Jeremy Sisto's performance as Brady, Melanie's boyfriend and another recovering alcoholic, who manages to play a pivotal role in the climax by providing the push Melanie needs to finally deal with Tracy.  The ""bad boyfriend"" is a stereotypical role in so many films, that it is a shock to see one be different in such a subtle way.
""Thirteen"" is a brutally honest film, the sort that you might never see again because once was enough, thank you very much.  The emotional conclusion is powerful, but I would not say it qualifies as being truly cathartic.  If there is a lesson here for parents it would simply be that when your children undergo radical transformations, of any type and in any direction, pay attention, because it could be too late sooner than you think.",1075420800,10,3830,4.759818731117825
1970112,5,B00013RC2K,"I don't care what anybody says especially about this movie being unrealistic. Well I can tell you from personal experience, it's VERY realistic. From the sex to the drugs, it's all out there. I am a gay teen & even though I can't relate to these girls' story, I can tell you that my best friend in the entire world has gone through much of what these girls do in this film...from pot to cocaine to sex with boys AND men. It happens more today than anybody is willing to recognize. Speaking from MY personal experiences, I know that every teen at one point or another feels like losing control & just letting go. I know alot of people at my high school that have slit their wrists and overdosed on alchohol. As far as no teen going through ALL of what the characters in Thirteen do, if you believe that, you are blind and in serious denial. Some teens may really have a pretty healthy family life & might be comfortable with who they are, but most of them don't. Because adolescense is when you find yourself and instead of finding themselves, alot of teens lose themselves first.
As far as the performances, I was amazed. Evan Rachel Wood is just BRILLIANT as Tracy, especially in one of the ending scenes when things have just gone so far & her mom has come to realise what's going on. Her mom is played by Academy Award Winning Actress Holly Hunter who is superb in her part. Nikki Reed stars as Evie (and also co-wrote the film), a young girl with a harder life than it would seem to be. I loved how Evie so desperately wanted Tracy's mom to adopt her. Evie had told Tracy's mother that her mom had died and that her caretaker was her aunt. But really, her aunt WAS her mom...she just didn't want to live with her, because of all the abuse she was being put through. In the end when Evie is sent back to her mother, she turns on Tracy & exposes what they have been doing, blaming it all on Tracy.
The story is just so moving & really gives the viewer a look into what really goes on with teens today. All the time, it just seems to start at a younger and younger age. I know that this really happens, because it has happened to me and people all around me. This shouldn't be that surprising to people or parents and should really open their eyes and give them a look into the world that alot of troubled teens are diving into. I also loved how the media presence could be felt and seen throughout the entire film, especially those glamourized eyes. If you look closely, the picture that we see on the sign throughout the movie gets dirtier and more vandilized as Tracy loses herself more and more.
With that said, I think this movie is THE most realistic portrayal of teen life that I've ever seen. The DVD is brilliant also. The menu is set up beautifully & the special features are great also. There's audio commentary featuring the cast and the director/co-writer, the theatrical trailer, and the featurette ""The Making Of Thirteen"" which has great interviews with the cast of the film. This is a must see for everyone. Rent it at least, it's a treasure not to be missed. And there's no happy ending, giving everyone an easy solution. Just a simple scream, because as much as Tracy and every other teen in the world would appreciate a happy ending, there's still many years ahead & alot of obstacles to overcome.",1075420800,3,3318,4.396747967479675
1970113,5,B00013RC2K,"""Thirteen"" may not shock you--I've read enough reviews on this site to know that--but the power of the three lead performances should stun you.
Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is a smart, serious 7th grader with some aching holes in her life. Her mother (Holly Hunter) is loving. However she's a recovering alcoholic with a former coke-addict boyfriend and a very noisy hairdressing practice that she runs from her home. Tracy returns from school every day to total chaos. Tracy's father seems stable on the surface but he is struggling to stay employed and is often absent from her life.
At some point, Tracy snaps. She courts Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular (i.e., sluttiest, fastest) girl in school by changing her clothing style and pickpotting money for an afternoon of shopping. From that moment on, the movie is a series of vignettes of Tracy's slide into sex, drugs, alcohol, and petty crime. ""Thirteen"" does not have a traditional plot: instead it takes you from point a to point b in Tracy's life with no neat resolution.
The three lead actors are outstanding. Evan Rachel Wood captures the heartbreak and the brutality of being thirteen: one minute you're a little girl, the next Lolita. Nikki Reed is a dangerous femme fatale in the style of Barbara Stanwyck. Holly Hunter captures a mother in denial beautifully. She knows but she doesn't know. And she really doesn't want to know.
I would recommend this movie to individuals who gravitate towards serious, art films. You don't need to be thirteen or have a thirteen-year old to appreciate it. In fact, by the end, you may be very glad that you're not either.",1075420800,,1619,4.827338129496403
1970114,4,B00013RC2K,"Let me take a minute to sigh a few times and do a little coping with what I just saw.  This movie could be a TAD more real, possibly by adding some more tears, but other than that; two thirteen year olds rebelling against nearly everything: sounds and looked, and FELT very real to me.  I have a younger sister who went through almost exactly what these two girls experienced.  The drugs, sex, alcohol, you name it, they were doing it.  Some of the scenes in this movie almost felt voyeuristic.  And will leave many wondering if it was legal for these girls to do.  The two young ladies playing these roles are Evan Rachel Wood and Nicki Reed (who is also the co-writer.)  (BEWARE!  SPOILER!)  There is a scene where these two girls are both making out with one of the girl's next door neighbors, who's character in the movie is supposed to be at least 7 or 8 years older.  I checked imdb.com, and the actor who portrayed the neighbor is Kip Pardue, born in 1976.  Evan Rachel was born in '87, Reed in '88.  Both of these girls were 15 when this movie was shot and he was 25-26.  SHOCK AND AWE!  How the hell did Catherine Hardwicke (director) pull this little stunt off.  Very powerful scene, but will leave you in absolute wonder days after you see the movie.
Other shocking scenes are of self-mutilation.  Evan Rachel's character taking razor blades to her forearm.  One can only turn away, and just accept what is happening.  I know there are other movies out there that are way more gruesome, such as Irreversible, but this was like a ""Kids"" sequel, except way more dramatic.  A very touching deleted scene is on the DVD where Evan Rachel's character (Tracy) comes home to find Reed's character (Evie) and her guardian sitting in the living room with her mother.  She leaves to ""use the restroom"" but the cut part of the scene is when her brother (played by Brady Corbet) catches her in the hallway, and wraps his arms around his sister; letting her know that he loves her very much, and that he knows the fall she set her self up for.  Heartwrenching, because I have given the same hug to my sister when she was a VERY rebellious teenager.
  I must give credit for the way this movie was shot.  It was filmed on a shaky dv cam, with low lighting to give the movie a more dark feel.  Which is exactly what is accomplished here, giving the audience a dark feel, and have their emotions run with each scene.  I would give this little gem five stars, but it lost one for a bit of quickness to the movie.  I felt that they could have spent a little more time in the beginning of the movie with a little more distance between Evie and Tracy, before they started hanging out.  It's almost like Tracy was suddenly accepted into a group that wouldn't be caught dead with her.  So, it would feel more real, if some more real scenes were going on; and that would make the climax even more emotional.
  Over all, wonderful, and touching film.",1075334400,,2936,4.401486988847584
1970115,5,B00013RC2K,"The litmus test for the realism in this one - watched it with a group of 12-18 year old girls and they all said it reflected the reality of being teenagers, with all the actual pressures and stresses of their high school and social lives. This is, quite simply, one of the most honest (and painful) movies about adolescence that I've ever seen..and it was written by a teenager who also stars in the movie...amazing!
 At the start of the movie, Tracy (played by Evan Rachel Wood) is a good student with a not-so-great family life. Her mother is struggling to put food on the table and under a lot of pressure to hold family and home together.
  So it makes sense that Tracy would be drawn to ""the coolest girl in school"", Evie, a wild rebel with a penchant for danger. Evie gladly takes Tracy under her wings, often pushing her into  Tracy into situations she isn't prepared for (parents should be aware that some of the scenes are graphic, including sexuality and nudity).
  It is impressive that this film is so utterly believable and the sensational and often shocking scenes make sense in the context of Tracy and Evie's lives. Adding to the strength of this film is Holly Hunter's strong performance as a mother who is desperate to save her daughter but isn't quite sharp enough to find the right path.
