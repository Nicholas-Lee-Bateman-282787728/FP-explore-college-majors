And though it states that the DVD is a high-quality DVD-R, the video quality is very bad. I gave up watching after half an hour.",1426636800,,322,4.666666666666667
8324234,4,B0007ZH9SO,"But it must be understood that Tai Chi and particularly
the long form and QI GONG must be taught to you by
a qualif\ied teacher or 'Master.'  This man is a such a master
but watching the video will not help a beginner.  You must
find a qualified instructor to learn this philosphy and practice.",1361750400,2,294,4.327272727272727
8324235,5,B0007ZH9SO,"I originally bought Wu Style Tai Chi Chuan 1: The Long Form (Gah Gee) several years ago in VCR format. I upgraded to a DVD player and needed to replace the tape with a DVD. The DVD I received contains the same instruction, and is exactly what I wanted. When I received the first VCR tape from E-Spy, there was a 130 page paperback book with pictures of the postures. The book was very helpful in learning the form and I was looking forward to replacing the well worn copy I still have. Sadly, there was no book with this DVD and, it appears, it is no longer included. If you can get a copy of the book it will greatly improve your learning experience.",1212796800,13,651,4.216
