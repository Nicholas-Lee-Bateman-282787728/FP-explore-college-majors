6759478,5,B00OQRU9U4,"At first my daughter didn't like this video, even though she loves elmo. But now it's one of her favorites. She's a few months away from being 2. She loves dancing and humming to the songs and tries to mimic the 'elmo slide' and the 'snazzy shuffle'. It's helping to teach her through the songs and dances about the names of her body. It would help to teach Spanish if she was already speaking English, but she still dances to the music no matter what language they're speaking in.",1476144000,,481,4.415730337078652

6759483,4,B00OQRU9U4,"Some songs are better than others. I wish there was a menu function so that you could skip over less preferred songs and skip to favorites. I also wish there was a list of the songs on the description of the video.

We've had this DVD for a few months so he's familiar with the songs now and as soon as he hears the intro music he gets excited. He especially loves the songs with Sugarland, Elvis Costello, Taye Diggs, Bruno Mars, and he gets excited over the short skits as well. I personally love the DVD; mostly because he does but it's also so catchy, I find myself singing the songs even after the DVD is finished lol.",1450569600,,485,4.34065934065934
