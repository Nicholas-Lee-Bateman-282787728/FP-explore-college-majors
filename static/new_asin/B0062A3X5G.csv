8491067,3,B0062A3X5G,There was nothing wrong with the DVD's quality. The eposodes on this set were differentf from the set 10 I needed.  Acorn Media I guess did two different sets of Midsomer. One  set says on the box as seen on A&E the other does not and they also have a series set. CRAZY!!!! JUST CHECK EPOSODES BEFORE BUYING. MY FAULT NOT THE SELLER.,1485820800,,333,4.26984126984127
