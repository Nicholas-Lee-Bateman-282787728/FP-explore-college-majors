8104947,5,B000E37312,"I like that this program begins with the Johnston McCaully book, then
thoroughly discusses the major contributions to the character that
Douglas Fairbanks added, and the impact that Guy Williams had on
popularizing Zorro.
 I also like that it covers all the other Zorro incarnations, from the serials to the newer TV series, and the other film stars: Tyrone Power, Frank Langella, etc.  Too bad that this program came out before the Queen of Swords, another program worthy of mention.",1245628800,,484,5.0375
