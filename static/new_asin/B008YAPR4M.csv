8532452,5,B008YAPR4M,A great watch for any Eminem fan.  The price was amazing.  The Dvd is great.  I gave it as a gift - but I am happy that the gift receiver lives in my house so I can rewatch it too!,1383177600,,180,3.45
8532453,1,B008YAPR4M,"This is another dvd that I could have just watched on youtube and not have wasted my money on.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Eminem but when I buy a dvd I want something new and original.",1376179200,,185,3.8684210526315788
8532454,1,B008YAPR4M,"Hmmmmm... the worst biography movie about Eminem. it's not even a biography! It's Discography and success in his career.  And this slogan! ""It's not about were he's been, but where he is going""
WHAT? what did you guys mean by that? This video is ONLY briefly about who the Eminem was! They even say in the end: ""No one has a crystal ball to say what will happen with Mathers' career in future"" Authors! DO NOT say, what you will not do! because that was the only reason I bought this DVD.
 I would like to say that I am a huge fan of Eminem's art and I watched a lot of biography movies  about him and read a biography book ""The Dark Story of Eminem"" (that I really advise everyone) SO in my opinion  this movie is nothing but Wikipedia info.... no! even worse! Wiki contains more info than this movie. it's only 30 min long  and 50% of that is just Eminem interviews that you can watch in YouTube!",1374192000,,898,4.228070175438597
