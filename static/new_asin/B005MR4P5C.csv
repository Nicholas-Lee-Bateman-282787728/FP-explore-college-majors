4835882,4,B005MR4P5C,"Here's another double feature DVD of Elvira's Movie Macabre. The ""movies"" included this time are Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Beast From Haunted Cave. I had already seen Santa Claus Conquers the Martians on an episode of Mystery Science Theater several years ago. Yep, you know that a movie is bad when it's included on both an episode of Mystery Science Theater and an episode of Elvira's Movie Macabre. But Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a movie that is bad in a good way. It's actually pretty enjoyable and festive. I'd give it about 2 1/2 stars, but with Elvira the rating bumps up to 3 1/2 stars.
Beast From Haunted Cave is another story. The movie was produced by Roger Corman and his brother Gene Corman. And it is very boring for the most part. The sound is bad, the film is badly lit, and the monster hardly ever appears. And when the monster does appear, you can't see it in all its glory thanks to the bad lighting. Definitely a 1 star movie, but the segments with Elvira are good enough to make it a 3 star episode.
So, she does it yet again. Elvira has made two more bad movies watchable thanks to her hilarious commentary and skits.",1333152000,3,1161,4.455399061032864
4835883,5,B005MR4P5C,"I'll admit I already own ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" but I could not resist buying this version with Elvira's take on it.  I love the film to begin with, cheesiness and all! But Elvira adds a new dimension with her funny commentary that is priceless. I'm sure guys will love her Santa outfit as well. You'll want to make this Elvira DVD a Christmas tradition!",1328140800,3,367,4.5606060606060606
4835884,5,B005MR4P5C,"The Mistress of The Dark, Elvira, is back with another exciting Double Feature DVD, and this one makes a great Christmas gift, in more ways than one!

 The movie ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"" is somewhat of a cult classic as it is, because it is so 'cheezy', that mice everywhere are stirring to watch it!

 Add Elvira's wit and sarcasm to it, and you have a fun DVD experience.

  The movie features a young Pia Zadora, as an alien child who wants to experience Christmas along with the other Martian children, and what better way to do that, than for the Martian leaders to kidnap Santa Claus (and two kids who were in the wrong place at the wrong time)?

 Apparently, the film's budget was lower than that of the average Elementary school play, if one takes a look at the cheap, 'cheezy' costumes the Martians are wearing (They look like part Freak Show performers, and part ""unused extras"" from the famous ""Nutcracker"" play).

  Oh, and look for the Polar Bear in this movie....so realistic you won't believe your eyes.......(sarcasm)

  Two of the highlights of this episode are:

1. The beginning ""claymation"" like segment of the show (although Santa Claus might disagree....the kids probably shouldnt see this part)

2. The sexy ""Santa"" outfit that Elvira wears will melt any amount of snow.

 The other movie on this DVD, ""Beast From Haunted Cave"": ???????

 I have watched EVERY episode of the new and improved, Season One, of ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"" and this is NOT one of them!

I don't know if this is a Season Two episode (if there even is a Season Two...I hope that there will be!), a never before seen Season One episode, or, most likely, an episode from the old ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"".

 I guess they wanted to keep the Christmas theme going and decided that this movie would be best. According to Amazon.com, the movie is about a snow beast who apparently whacks a bunch of gangsters.

 It should be interesting.

 It would have been nice if Elvira and crew had shot new segments and wisecracks just for this movie's DVD release, and it would also be nice if they could give us some BRAND NEW bonus features, instead of using the same ones on every DVD from Season One.

 All in all, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.",1317168000,8,2240,4.611675126903553

Sincerely hope this helped, and here's to wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, kiss my arse. Kiss his arse. Kiss your arse. Happy H@nukk@h""...Enjoy!

PS  Youll notice this listing claims there are none special features, and while not topnotch, they are still fairly entertaining and definitely worth mentioning. You will find these listed below, along with other details from the DVD insert.

8479665,4,B005MR4P5C,"The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE seems out of place here, given the implied holiday theme of SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS and a cover photo of Elvira sporting a Santa hat.  The perfect second feature for this would have been 1959's SANTA CLAUS, a bizarre holiday offering from Mexico in which Santa squares off against Satan.",1412899200,,376,4.696969696969697
8479666,4,B005MR4P5C,"Elvira's ""Movie Macabre"" returned to television on 2010 for a short stint, and, although it never ran several episodes, the show garnered enough interest for DVD releases. I've been a huge Elvira fan since I was a whelp, so these releases were essential to me even though there are a lot of drawbacks to these releases.

But first the good stuff: Elvira's Christmas episode is an amazing barrage of sexy costumes, eye-rolling (and head-rolling) jokes and a slick claymation introduction sequences that goes down (pun intended!) as a highlight of the series. The second, unaired episode is pad for the course stuff, though it still manages to subsist on Elvira's wit and knack for snappy wisecracks.

The downside to these DVDs is that all of the movies are easily obtainable domain films that are cut for television and usually presented in less-than-stellar prints. ""Beast From Haunted Cave"", for instance, looks the same as those old Brentwood DVD releases.

If you like Elvira, get this of the big box (...) set. Don't get these for the movies because you will be disappointed.",1407024000,2,1080,4.955801104972376
8479667,5,B005MR4P5C,This double feature of  Elvira's Movie Macabre features the cult classis Santa Claus conquers the Martians and the Roger Corman classis Beast from Haunted Cave. Beast from Haunted Cave is the story of gangsters who while trying to escape after a robbery come across a horrific blood sucking monster. While that is going on Elvira fires her entire crew to save some money and learns a hard lesson. In Santa Claus Conquers the Martians Elvira in a naughty santa outfit treats the viewers to plenty of wacky scary x-mas chaos and a god awful Christmas movie.
