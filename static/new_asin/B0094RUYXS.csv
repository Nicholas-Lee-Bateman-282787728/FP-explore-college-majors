8610846,5,B0094RUYXS,"My first Naam yoga class was at Agape International Spiritual Center's 2013 New Year Retreat out in Joshua Tree, California. I immediately fell in love with Naam yoga. It was with Lemia Astarabadi and Joshua Bowser! They are awesome being of Light. I love that they used ylang-ylang oil for that day. Ylang-ylang oil and Naam helped opened my heart. I learned later after the retreat was over that Naam yoga helped cured my chronic shoulder pain that I had been dealing with since 17.

Of course once I got back to Nebraska (where I am currently living) I wanted to continue with Naam yoga. The problem was Nebraska does not have Naam yoga classes anywhere. For me this was not a big deal. I went online and found the only dvd for sale that offered Naam Yoga. It was Elena Vailenka's dvd! I brought the dvd and immediately continue doing Naam yoga once it arrived in the mail.

I brought the dvd for two reasons: One, being I wanted to continue to do Naam yoga. Second, I wanted to feel happier. Elena Vailenka's dvd is for happiness. It was perfect! Before the New Year's retreat I was going through some rough times. I felt so alone. I didn't have any real friends. I am currently 21 years old and in college. My grades were dropping; I was on academic probation. I was about to get kick out of college because of low grades. I was depressed from the winter blue. I didn't know how to deal with depression in a healthy way. Most days I lied in bed and replay old hurts in my head. I went to all of my classes and went home to lie in bed. I stayed there for hours. I barely did my homework. I was depressed and mad at myself for not having a closer relationship with my deceased father whom passed 4 years ago. I was gaining rapid weight from eating lots of meat and processed food. I was deeply unhappy at the way I looked and feel. I thought of myself as fat and ugly. I had low self-esteem. I felt so disconnected with God and with my family members. I didn't have any self-love for myself. I felt completely broken by the end of 2012. I was considering suicide. That was all before Naam yoga. Naam yoga changed my life. Elena dvd helped changed my life too.

Elena's dvd is wonderful. I shared this dvd with my mom. I did Naam yoga with her. It helped me gain a closer relationship with my mom. It opened my heart and mind to God. I feel a lot closer with God after doing 3 weeks with this dvd. I am more compassionate toward others and myself.

This dvd is also great because I am going to be a Naam yoga teacher by this August. This dvd helps me to learn the mantras in a fun and healing way  I am grateful for Elena and her dvd.

8610847,5,B0094RUYXS,"I was blessed with the gift of Elena's dvd several months ago.  This DVD has literally changed my life.  It has opened up a totally new world of yoga for me and I can not get enough of Naam Yoga.  Elena is beautiful and happy and she makes me feel beautiful and happy.  I love the dvd as I can spend as little or as much time on my practice as it has 7  daily practices.  Sometimes I turn it on only to hear both the uplifting and calming music.  However and most importantly, the energy and radiance I feel after completing a practice is amazing. Thank you for the creation of this practice so that it can be readily available to all.  If you are feeling down and not sure where to go or do with your life, I strongly recommend trying this DVD. It can only help.",1359676800,,763,4.073825503355705

8610850,4,B0094RUYXS,"these are unique and engaging meditations that combine intense breathing exercises with various arm and hand motions that might seem unusual at first but after a few minutes become exhilarating.  There are seven different sets of meditations done sequentially over seven days, taking about 20-25 minutes a day, and Elena's soothing voice and the stimulating meditations are a great way to launch your day.",1349568000,,405,5.328125
