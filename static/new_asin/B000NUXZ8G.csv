2783440,5,B000NUXZ8G,I loved this collection!  There should have been more.  I am really bummed that this is the extent of it.  George is perfect and of course Diana Rigg is the ideal Mes. Bradley.  Definitely want to see more of the Mrs. Bradley's Mysteries.,1375056000,,238,4.465116279069767

2783446,5,B000NUXZ8G,"Produced in 1999 length 1 hr 22 min. based on a novel ""Speedy Death"" by Gladys Mitchell.

Mrs. Adela Bradley (Diana Rigg), amateur sleuth has her Bunter, oops, I mean chauffeur George (Neil Dudgeon). The pair plays off on another as if they could read each other's mind.

It is the year 1929. We are privy to Mrs. Bradley going to her ex-husbands funeral as back ground. ""Today, a funeral, tomorrow, an engagement party. Life goes on, n'est-pas?""Says Mrs. Bradley as she has been invited to her Goddaughter Eleanor's (Emma Fielding) engagement party. There as in all good mysteries we are introduced to the main characters (soon to be suspects) as Eleanor's affianced is mysteriously dispatched that evening. Who could've done it and why? The investigating doctor must prepare for a real shocker and so do we.

People who are used to this type or British mystery will have pretty much guessed the answer by this time. However it's fun to see how the characters slowly comes to the realization of what happened. By the way will anybody else be dispatched in the process?

""Speedy Death"" is actually a part of a series of Mrs. Bradley on film.
""Speedy Death"" takes one DVD
There are two more DVDs each with two complete standalone stories for a total of five.
You may be spending time saying where I have seen that actor before as they are very popular in British mystery series'.

2783447,5,B000NUXZ8G,"Those who enjoy Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries will also enjoy Mrs Bradley. She was on the scene ages before. Great costumes, cast and dialog. Totally avant garde and emancipated before it became the norm, Mrs. Bradley and her butler use common sense, science and forensics, as well as psychology to unravel the mysteries. There is a chemistry between the two main characters that implies an intimacy beyond employer and employee, but one can never be sure. Tongue in cheek humor is priceless. ATTENTION to all that consider the purchase. Please read and understand the zoning restrictions. The discs are for ZONE 2, Europe not USA or Canada, unless you have a DVDs player that is not restricted. Computers and laptops will play the DVDs, but will prompt the user if they want to change the zone. Many electronics will allow the zone changes only 5 times. I purchase different DVDs all the time and found the investment in an unrestricted/no zone DVD player worth it. The stories are truly enjoyable and suitable for all family members.",1449878400,,1036,4.892045454545454
2783448,5,B000NUXZ8G,"These five charming, period whodunits from the BBC were broadcast between 1986 and 2000.  Great performances from Dame Diana Rigg (Avengers); Neil Dungeon (Midsomer Murders) and Peter Davidson (Campion).  Subtitles and a 'play all' option.",1442966400,,239,5.8
2783449,5,B000NUXZ8G,"Entertaining all the way.  Of course, I'm biased because Ms. Rigg is a favorite.  But she's positively charming, with a good supporting cast.  Particularly the chauffeur.  The mysteries were decent, if not entirely a surprise at the end.  But that's largely because they don't throw curveballs.  They lay it out before you, which I prefer.

Well worth the time.  The quality of the video transfer was fine, but some extras would have been nice.",1440460800,,444,4.905405405405405
2783450,5,B000NUXZ8G,"Love the style of Diana Rigg as Mrs. Bradley.  The stories are well written and match the era well they represent.

I find the stories intelligent, non predictable and very entertaining.  I enjoy watching the relationship between Mrs. Bradley and George.

Highly recommend the series.  If you invest in a Region Free DVD player, you may be able to purchase the non USA format DVD for a much cheaper price than the USA formatted version.  The picture and sound quality of the non USA format DVD are quite good.",1436313600,,509,4.662921348314606
2783451,5,B000NUXZ8G,"had forgotten how much fun this series was.  love diana rigg as mrs. bradley and had forgotten d.i. barnaby, neil dudgeon was her chauffeur.  a perfect pairing. this is a totally enjoyable mystery series, one that can be watched over and over again. the acting, writing, production are all top quality.  i found purchasing a reasonably priced all free region dvd player has been a godsend, as i no longer have to be careful to buy region 1 only...it was one of the best purchases i ever made.",1425513600,,492,4.568181818181818

2783453,5,B000NUXZ8G,"Note that it is a region 2 release so you will need a DVD player set to the appropriate region.  If you love mysteries and the work of Diana Rigg, you will throughly enjoy this short series.  For Doctor Who fans, Peter Davison appears in three of the episodes.",1409097600,,260,4.285714285714286

2783456,4,B000NUXZ8G,"I love Dianna Rigg.  The she plays a rich, liberated, cynical and kind mystery solver. Her driver is a good contrast.  The scenes in the Rolls are priceless.  The DVD played smoothly on my laptop with no issues despite being Region 2.",1393545600,,234,4.523809523809524

Wish that was on streaming on amazon prime U.S.",1501027200,,97,3.9
8181439,4,B000NUXZ8G,"4.5 stars I enjoyed this series, I only wish it had been on longer. It's a great mystery and is relatively lighthearted, not dark and gloomy like some British mysteries are,  I'm disappointed a number of people gave the series a bad rating because they didn't notice it was region 2.  I don't know what the listing said when they purchased but right now it says in three different places that it is region 2 and won't play on north American DVD players.  If it didn't say anything when they made their purchase, they could have easily returned it because the fault would have been Amazon's and if they ignored what it said about region 2 then the fault was theirs -- neither case has anything to do with the quality of the show or the quality of the DVDs, so it doesn't deserve the negative rating and it could be misleading to other buyers (a lot of buyers filter out items rated below a certain level.  Luckily this show has enough good ratings to make up for the misleading negative reviews).  I actually bought this DVD from Amazon UK and the price differences on DVDs between Amazon and Amazon UK, even with international shipping, make getting a multi region DVD player more than worth it.  For example I just got this for $9.74 from Amazon UK and it would have been even cheaper if I had bought other DVDs at the same time because of the combined shipping cost.  Last week I got the entire series of Monk for $28.82 (currently $91.40 on U.S. Amazon). Multi region DVD players and region 2 DVDs are awesome if you buy from the right place.",1499040000,,1545,4.438162544169611
