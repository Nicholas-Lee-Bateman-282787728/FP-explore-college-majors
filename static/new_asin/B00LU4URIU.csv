8668150,1,B00LU4URIU,Quality of the DVD is terrible all four of the movies freeze constantly. It is totally unwatchable.,1517616000,,99,4.882352941176471
8668151,5,B00LU4URIU,"Bought this 4 movie set because I wanted to see the movie songwriter and it was cheaper than buying the movie songwriter alone.  Songwriter was a good movie.  Love Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson together.  There are always laughs with the two of them together.  They play off each other so well.  I also watched Bloodworth.  I hadn't really wanted to see Bloodworth before because looked sad, but since it was on the 4-movie set, I thought I would watch it.  It is a good film with a good story but it is very very sad.  What was left of a dysfunctional tortured family is completely destroyed in the end.  You are supposed to take hope in the grandson moving forward to happiness in the end, and you do, but it is difficult to forget the sadness that brought him there.  I haven't had the opportunity to watch the other two movies in this set yet, but I hope to in the near future.",1470182400,,888,4.359756097560975
