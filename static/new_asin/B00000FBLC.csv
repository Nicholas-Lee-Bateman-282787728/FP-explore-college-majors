8655725,3,B00000FBLC,"This tape is a nice reprint of two PBS airings on Backpacking. It is an entertaining account of one man's hiking experience in this beautiful country. My only complaint is that it falls short on information. I was expecting a guide to hiking in Belize, which would include 'what to bring', 'equipment you should have', etc. There is little content on the flora & fauna...except Killer Bees & Ticks and some casual shots of a few birds and snakes. Overall it was enjoyable, but not informative.",998784000,,493,4.744186046511628
