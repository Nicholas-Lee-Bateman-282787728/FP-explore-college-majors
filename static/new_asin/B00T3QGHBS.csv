8700173,3,B00T3QGHBS,"Decent sequel. Does not attempt to stitch together any sort of a story, unlike the original. Great footage.

Wish it had more variety, more on trials, speedway, etc. The MotoGP footage is amazing, but the chase for the championship happened years ago, so its not timely. Of course, no movie can keep up with the speed of modern motorsports coverage.

When I walked out of the theater in 1971 after watching the original, I HAD to go ride my motorcycle. This one just doesn't light that fire.",1451260800,,491,4.632183908045977
