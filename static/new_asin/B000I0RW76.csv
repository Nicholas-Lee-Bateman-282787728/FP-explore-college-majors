8185865,5,B000I0RW76,I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered from Planet Bollywood. But I was able to recall very many of the beautiful songs I had heard and admired as child and especially sung by the veteran Saigal whom I have mentored for a long time. This movie has also reminded me a bit of the Moghul History. Audio and Video are of excellent quality. Like the rest it was worth all the cost I managed to pay by saving here and there. I have not seen the whole movie but part of the domestic life of Shah Jehan and his most beautiful Madam Empress Mumtaz Jehan and the Wonder of the World the Taj Mahal is the eternal testimony of their Love and the Legacy to be shared and cherished to enrich our lives for peace and prosperity.,1457481600,,728,4.133802816901408
8185866,3,B000I0RW76,Good story. Not the best historical movie I have seen. Can not verify any of the facts. So I don't know if it is a complete fiction or if there is any truth to any of the story.,1257552000,,177,3.6842105263157894
