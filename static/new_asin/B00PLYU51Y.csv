8688684,5,B00PLYU51Y,"I saw this on TV. Fantastic show (including at the beginning my girlfriend's handsome son Jared from Australia), but where can I buy an Australian version? This story tells you about Peter Munk's escape from the Nazi Regime in 1944, who then went on to become the largest goldmine owner in the world.
