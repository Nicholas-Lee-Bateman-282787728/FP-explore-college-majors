8195737,5,B000QCUZLG,I recently received this DVD as a gift and I love it.  It is a great way to do Tai-Chi in the home. I find the instructers enjoyable and the program easy to follow.  I have found that on the days that I do Tai-Chi I am more relaxed and peaceful.  I love it!!,1207440000,,258,3.740740740740741
8195738,5,B000QCUZLG,"I have attended Dr. Garrett's Tai Chi class for a number of months.  I have have had great results attending the class.  The class makes me feel that all of my cells have been oxygenated and I have lots of energy.  I purchased the Tai Chi Life Training DVD and I am excited to have it in my home. Its easy for me to get into a relaxed--yet focused mental state while watching the DVD. It is wonderful for the days when I want to do the program at home.  The DVD is very high quality--professionally done and it gives me a feeling of being connected to the instructors as I do these focused, deep breathing exercizes. I highly recommend this program to anyone wanting more energy, a positive outlook, and a relaxed,focused state of mind.

No lighting was used and the male instructor is mostly shadowed and his face is rarely clear.

There are pure white posters and windows behind them which shimmer throughout the piece and are distracting (again, a lighting issue).

There is NO menu for the DVD. You have to go through everything to get to what you want. You can click Next, but it takes you to undefined sections. A menu would have been nice.

I'm not sure why the male instructor was wearing a tae kwon do uniform for a tai chi piece, but that's a minor nitpick...

The ending cheer was kind of goofy but did make me smile...

Again, content is OK, but too many production issues make it hard to use.  It's more like a home movie or an in-school training DVD, not a professionally produced one.",1180569600,2,902,4.3017751479289945
