8184465,2,B000OCXNSA,Corny Narration and summary of the tournament with very short clips of the action. Does not spend the time on Tiger Woods playing golf. Video is short. Wasted my money.,1384646400,,168,4.633333333333334
8184466,3,B000OCXNSA,"While this is probably the best way to relive the 1997 Masters (unless you taped it live), I was disappointed in the video quality and graphics. The content was good and it was indeed entertaining, but I hoped for more extra features.",1370649600,,234,4.595238095238095
8184467,5,B000OCXNSA,"If you want to see golf at its finest at a golf course storied for it's history and prestige and enjoy the play of a young Tiger Woods, then this DVDs for you.

Now of course you don't have to meet all those criteria to enjoy this DVD for what it is.

This is back when Tiger was longer, stronger and had the best short game of any tour player around at that time. His play was truly special and was great to be alive at the time when technology was able to capture the golf Tiger played at Agusta in 1997.

If you're a fan of Tiger, if your fan of golf, or if you're a fan of Augustine national, and this is a fantastic addition to your library.

Go and pick this bad boy up.",1363910400,,676,3.9124087591240877

8184469,5,B000OCXNSA,"If you are looking to build your collection of golf videos this is a goof one to watch. Really, it depends on what you are after - there are thousands out there, but for just over ($10.00) as of Dec 2010 this is not a bad deal.

Good golf, good stories, good price.",1292716800,,265,4.0
