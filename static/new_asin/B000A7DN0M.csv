This film is incredibly weird and focuses on dreams and how painful living can be. It made my heart ache with how beautiful and sad the whole thing was. The acting is so good that these characters feel like real people, and it really sticks with you. I dare anyone not to fall in love with the main character. The music in the film is perfectly melancholy, so it fits right in with the tone. I've already watched it twice in the one day that I've owned it. This is the start of my non-region 1 DVD collection, and now one of my favorite films of all time.",1439596800,,812,4.043478260869565
