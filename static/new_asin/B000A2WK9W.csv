8073014,2,B000A2WK9W,"This movie mimics the more popular ""Tales From the Crypt"" and rather poorly. These are the types of low budget productions you thought about doing in the eighth grade. The difference between the ones you did and these is marketing. The scripts are shortened versions of longer films and they appear to have been filmed in the same location.

For example how bad it is: In the first episode the guys claim it is hot. There is an overcast. Todd (Tony Olivas) is out on this hot day doing his morning run by doesn't sweat. In fact he only sweats when he dreams. The special effects are few and not note worthy. The acting was pretty bad too.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1361059200,,681,4.44
8073015,3,B000A2WK9W,"Tales From the Grave is a collection of gore-heavy short movies that follow three different stories.  While it starts off as some enjoyable schlock horror, the film loses its spark as the stories change.

The movie starts strong with ""Beyond Death"", which is actually just a condensed version of the 2000 full-length horror film ""The Dead Hate the Living.""  Here's the thing; if you're not a fan of 70's schlock horror flicks, or campy gore movies, you're simply not going to enjoy it.

I myself was surprised at how much fun the film was, as they intentionally shot it as a nod to old-school B Movies.  If you're a fan of 60's and 70's horror, you'll probably enjoy it, otherwise you'll hate it.

It's only after ""Beyond Death"" ends that the film becomes less interesting.  The second story focuses on a group of five hot women that compete in a horror-themed reality TV program.  For the most part, the story lacks any spark.  While there's a good bit of gore and maggot shots, it's just not very interesting.  Joe Estevez, uncle to Charlie Sheen, gets an almost pointless 30-second cameo in the movie.

The film wraps up with ""The Rotting Dead"", which involves several pranksters who anger a vengeful witch.  This is the only short film in the collection with any nudity, courtesy of the painfully sexy B-Movie veteran Debbie Rochon.  Oddly enough, every sex scene in the short film occurs off-camera, with an exterior shot of the witch's house while moaning takes place.

The budget for this short is noticeably lower than that of the other two films.  It seemed as though not much effort was put into Rotting Dead as the other movies, although there are a couple of disturbing scenes.

If you're into campy horror, this is worth watching on Netflix Instant.  But you're probably better off buying the DVD for ""The Dead Hate the Living"" as a full feature film, rather than this collection of two okay shorts, and a condensed movie.  And if you're not a fan of old school, intentionally-bad horror flicks, this won't be your thing.",1310947200,4,2034,4.713881019830028
8073016,1,B000A2WK9W,Wow ........ I wish I could rate this movie a freaking negative 5 stars !!!! This movie consisted of four or five tales and all of the tales were stupid. Really bad acting and a really dumb story line for all the movies. The acting really really really sucked. It was like reading a dictionary out loud. I would not recommend this movie waste of money.,1161388800,,352,4.348484848484849
8073017,1,B000A2WK9W,I wish I could have given it 0 stars. This movie was so horrible. I could not even get passed the first story. This movie should not be compared to Tales from the Crypt. What is going to happen to the fate of our low budget movie industry?,1141430400,,239,4.0
