1876532,5,B00008ZZ7W,"Since 1995 a lot of television movies have copied the plot of Lady Killer to a T but this film is in a place all its own.

Janice (Judith Light) is the neglected wife of rich businessman Ross. She has a passionate affair with plastic surgeon Guy (Jack Wagner). From the beginning it's obvious that Guy has a strange attraction to Janice. He meets her at a museum opening, gets her number and begins calling her. Janice thinks he's just a man trying to be friendly and meets him for lunch. During lunch Guy hints that she goes back to his place. Janice doesn't at that time but soon after she accepts his invitation. They make love and from that point on, Guy and Janice have a full blown love affair.

Janice is using the affair as means of escape but Guy has fallen in love with Janice. Once Ross and Janice resurrect their failing marriage, Janice breaks things off with Guy and all hell breaks loose. Guy begins stalking Janice. He calls her home constantly until she changes the number. He breaks into her home one morning while Ross is upstairs. He pops up at her job, tries to seduce her and when Janice rejects him, he brutally rapes her. Janice ends up in the hospital where she lies to Ross and her daughter Sharon (Tracey Gold) about the attack. She claims she is raped by a stranger and just wants to put the ordeal behind her.

Janice knows now that Guy is insane and dangerous but she doesn't realize how obsessed he is until he begins dating Sharon just to get close to Janice. Guy finagles his way onto a trip with Sharon to see Janice and Ross in the wilderness. Guy flaunts his relationship with Sharon in hopes to make Janice jealous but disgusted by him, she threatens she'll tell everyone he raped her. Guy plays buddy-buddy to Ross and they go off on a hunting trip where Guy uses the opportunity to shoot Ross, leaving him wounded in the snow. Guy confronts Janice, chases her through the woods and tries to rape her again when Sharon pulls a rifle on him and Guy ends up falling to his death.

I first saw this in 1995 when it debuted on CBS and it is still one of my favorite television movies. The acting is very good and Jack Wagner really impressed me. Before this I didn't believe he had the range to play such a character but he works wonders as Guy. Judith Light shined as a heroine you can't help rooting for.

I recommend to those who love romantic, sexy and steamy films with plenty of thrills along the way.",1328313600,8,2441,4.36784140969163
1876533,5,B00008ZZ7W,"I'm a huge Judith Light fan, so I really loved this movie. The plot is very suspenseful and I was on the edge of my seat. If you like suspense and a Lifetime Movie sort of feel, you will really love this film. It's basically a fatal attraction type of film. This wealthy wife feels neglected by her husband and makes a huge mistake by sleeping with some guy who is really obsessed with her.
I'm really happy they made this on DVD. I remember when I saw it on TV and I wanted to tape it. Now I have it and I couldn't be happier!",1282435200,8,527,3.981132075471698
1876534,4,B00008ZZ7W,The title for me does not fit the movie. When you here the words lady killer you might think the person is doing a lot of killing but thats not the case. It is really about a woman in a loveless maraige who finds love with another man. She has this short affair with the man and realizes she is still in love with her husband so she dumps the guy and he starts stalking her. Thats the movie .,1250640000,2,392,3.9125

7988439,1,B00008ZZ7W,Nonsensical and far fetched.  A handsome plastic surgeon becomes obsessed with an older woman and turns psycho in the process.  The motivate just was not there.  He did not want money from her so we never believe the story.  If he had been a gigolo at least it would make sense.,1507420800,3,278,4.392156862745098
