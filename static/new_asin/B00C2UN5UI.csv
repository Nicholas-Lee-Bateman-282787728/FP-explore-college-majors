very Good",1404086400,,83,6.0
5689314,5,B00C2UN5UI,"There probably aren't many people who haven't seen Avatar or Titanic by now (based on how much money these movies have made, seems like most people have seem them multiple times) so I'll skip reviewing the content, and instead remark on the unique features of this set: both movies are 3D. If you're wanting to grab a Blu-Ray set to see whether 3D content is worth investing further in, this should be the set. Avatar is perhaps the most beautiful film I have ever seen in 3D, and remains to this day the only movie that I would suggest must be seen in 3D... normally it is an ""okay"" extra in the film, but in this case the third dimension seems required to truly appreciate the world of Pandora. As for Titanic, it is the best example of post-production conversion to 3D available to witness to date. Other post-converted films just don't quite live up to it... Avengers you can barely notice the 3D, same with the Harry Potter films, about the only other film that comes anywhere close for live-action post-production 3D quality is Star Trek: Into Darkness, and Titanic wins out for value (if you just want to make a single purchase before starting to convert your collection) by being paired with the penultimate 3D film, Avatar.",1400803200,59,1232,4.63013698630137

After purchasing a TV that has 3D capabilities, we wanted to watch a film that utilized the technology to its full potential. After some quick research, we decided to purchase this set. What a marvelous experience it is! It's almost like watching the film for the first time. James Cameron and his crew are incredible.",1511740800,3,472,4.564705882352941

Also, as others mentioned the Titanic is a 4 disc set, but it does not come with a standard DVD copy.  One set is for 3D, the other is for Blu Ray.

5689398,5,B00C2UN5UI,Christmas gift for son for his 3D projection movie room. He only really wanted Avatar but got a 2 pkg deal now he has to watch chick flick Titanic with his wife. I still feel bad.,1486512000,2,179,4.0
5689399,5,B00C2UN5UI,I purchased a Epson 2045 projector which has the ability to project 3-D material so eventually bought a Sony Blu-ray 3-D player to take advantage of that ability. There are certain films that show off 3-D at its very best and AVATAR would be at the top of any such list. I had never seen James Cameron's TITANIC until I purchased this double bill set from England (a better price) and was thrilled to find that the converted 3-D to be just as amazing as AVATAR. If you purchase this set from overseas you will have no trouble playing the 3-D material here on Region 1 players. TITANIC comes with the 3-D divided on 2 full Blu-ray discs with a third disc containing a 2-D Blu-ray edition of the feature and a fourth Blu-ray disc with all kinds of outstanding extras that I found to be fascinating. AVATAR has a Blu-ray 3-D disc with the feature only and a DVD version of the feature that is in the Pal format and will not play on Region 1 discs. So if you want a DVD version of that film then you will need to purchase a Region Set. As Paramount and 20th Century-Fox combined their resources to produce the film they have divided the world market. If you buy the Region 1 set the Paramount sign will recede the film and if you purchase it from England as I did it will have the Fox sign.,1486339200,3,1286,4.253061224489796

5689417,5,B00C2UN5UI,"If you just got a new 3D tv or projector and you want some 3d media for display purposes, you really can go wrong with this combo pack. Most places have Avatar priced at nearly this price point, so you get Titanic for free. Big deal right. You've seen Titanic, and you're over it. Titanic is AWESOME in 3D. You won't be watching this for the movie. You have seen the movie, people fall in love, the boat sinks, and the boy dies. But the 3D effects are worth watching this again.
I paired this movie, with the Samsung&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2x-Pair-Samsung-Rechargeable-3D-Active-Glasses-Black/dp/B004PYEBZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(2x Pair) Samsung Rechargeable 3D Active Glasses, Black</a>.

If you are new to 3D, you will want a completely light controlled room. If there is ambient light, even with the best display source, you will lose most of the immersive effect of 3D. So you will just feel like you are wearing sunglasses while watching a movie. But if you have a nice 3D display, and a dark room, Avatar, and Titanic in 3D will wow you.",1483401600,8,1246,5.082926829268293
5689418,4,B00C2UN5UI,"This would be 5 stars if not for a few things. Others have had complaints about the Blu-ray, but I didn't order it for that. I was only interested in the 3D, the quality of which was great. Obviously I can't comment on the movies themselves, because come on...Avatar and Titanic. My first issue comes with the packaging, so something minor really. The Avatar case was fine, but the Titanic case is somewhat awkward and difficult to open and close. And on the note of Titanic, my second complaint is with this movie being split into 2 discs. I'm not entirely certain that was necessary. Otherwise, definitely worth the cost.",1482710400,,623,4.672727272727273

5689427,3,B00C2UN5UI,"I watched this movie via streaming online to my 3D TV and it was better than this CD. Throughout the move I was removing and reinstalling my 3D glasses to see if there was any difference. I could barely tell a difference and the clarity of the 3D varied across the screen. In the center of the screen it was clearer and the closer you got to the edge of the screen the blurrier it got. There was very little depth if any at all. At best, it blurred the objects that were supposed to be far away and made the objects that were supposed to appear up close to be clearer. You can do this with 2D. My guess is that the CD I got is a copy or something. I was really looking forward to the 3D experience I witnessed the first time I saw this movie. Avatar set the standard for 3D. This CD does the original movie no justice.",1479254400,,818,4.024539877300613

Titanic also comes with a disc loaded with an overwhelming amount of bonus material which I enjoyed. Avatar is also a great movie and stunning to watch in 3D but sadly no bonus material.

Amazing considering the 3d was added after the fact.  I already owned the collector's edition of Avatar and have watched it in 2d plenty of times.  It's a movie that I feel you should watch once in 3d to admire the detail in landscape, flora and fauna.  And then in 2d to pay attention to the story.  Getting both for under $40 is a steal.

Note that the 5 BluRays included in the set are region free and will play in North America. Along with the 3d BluRay version of Avatar, the set also contains a single DVD that is coded for PAL region. It will NOT work in normal North American DVD players.",1468195200,36,761,4.206896551724138

As for Avatar, well 3-D is the ONLY way to experience this movie!  I'm using a Sony HW-40ES projector, Play station 3, and PS3 3-D glasses onto a 106"" screen and it is fantastic.  In Avatar, when Eywa's flowery manifestations appear, they float off the screen into the room!  If you can only afford ONE 3-D Blue Ray, Avatar is the one to get.

The sound quality on both is outstanding.  I'm running a dual 18-in sub-woofer and you can feel the ship groaning as the metal over-stresses.  Avatar's sound track is literally room shaking; you'll be hiding from the explosions under your chair.  I love it :)
