These twelve double sided DVDs contain fifty different movies. Most date to the 1930s and 1940s, before expenses went up for producing these low cost films. There is a variety of stars, Roy Rogers (5), John Wayne (4), Tex Ritter (2), and Gene Autry (1). There are movies with real cowboys (like Hoot Gibson and Tim McCoy). The other stars are: Tom Tyler, Ken Maynard and brother Kermit (circus and rodeo riders), Buck Jones, Bob Steele, George O'Brien, Ray Corrigan, and many others. These mostly B&W films are now banned from broadcast TV, but you may remember them from the 1950s and 1960s. These were low budget ""B pictures"" that ran for an hour. You can compare them to current hour long dramas on TV. Back then most farms, stores, and ranches were owner operated small businesses; no national chains or franchises. Some of these movies were set in the 19th century, others are in modern times (automobiles, radios, and telephones). Many are concerned with the economic struggles that marked that era. The right to keep and bear arms was well recognized when these films were made. [Newer versions may not have the paper case with the movies listed, only a booklet.]
