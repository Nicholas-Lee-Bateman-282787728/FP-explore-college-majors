8403313,1,B003R6XMNG,"This is one of Lash's best movies: decent direction, a really strong supporting cast, and a wicked finale. Unfortunately, it's too painful to watch in this version. The black and white contrast is so extreme that features disappear from people's faces, a white horse running down a dusty road can't be seen, and any action taking place in a shadow, such as under a tree or a covered sidewalk. is hidden in blackness.",1503964800,,416,4.712328767123288
