8052536,1,B0007W4IO0,"A video of yesteryear.  I should have read the description of this video more closely.  Sadly, I have 2 or 3 of these old videos still hanging around, but was surprised to see they are now on DVD.  I just could not get over this old workout--not to mention the legwarmers of yesteryear.

Save your money when looking for an update-to-date workout.",1461456000,,347,4.548387096774194
8052537,5,B0007W4IO0,"Awesome workout! You will see results in less than 10 workouts. Calorie Killer 2 is tough, but fun!",1404691200,,99,4.555555555555555
8052538,5,B0007W4IO0,"This DVD gets an ""A"" for variety and cueing. You don't get bored with all the different moves, and it was quite strenuous. Dale Brabham is a good instructor and her cueing is on the mark. I never did the wrong side as I sometimes still do in some other Firm videos. Calorie Killer 2 is a mix of low-impact and high-impact aerobics, and light weight lifting sequences in Firm style: aerobics, then weights, then floor exercises focusing on the legs, butt, and abs. There are squat sequences to tone your butt and legs, and all The Firm tapes are good arm workouts. This is an excellent DVD for strenuous workout. I can't do all the moves now because of mild arthritis, so I modify the plyo jumps and the squats, and do some of the aerobics in low-impact style. I still get a great workout.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Firm-Cardio-Calorie-Killer-2/dp/B0007W4IO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Firm (Cardio) : Calorie Killer 2</a>",1297641600,9,972,5.27741935483871
8052539,5,B0007W4IO0,"I have had The Firm's classic vhs tapes Vols. I-VI & Vol. VIII for some time.  Of those Vol. I is the one I love best, followed by Vol. II and Vol. III.  I've recently purchased many more classic exercise videos by The Firm, including this one (2003).  At first I wondered when the bouncy cardio part would end (dance-like, at a clip, impact you can modify if you must) and we would start getting down to business.  Then I thought to the title, Calorie Killer.  So, cardio.  Hmm.  It was over in 46 minutes; I feel energized.  I was prepared for the turn on the air-conditioning, stepping on the tall box kind of workout, but I am delighted with this presentation.  & I like the stretches with the dowel.  I'll be working out to this DVD again soon.  Good choice of choreographer, Susan Harris from my favorite Vol. I.",1270339200,6,818,4.386666666666667
8052540,4,B0007W4IO0,"This workout is somewhat of a mixed bag.  The first half hour is spent doing cardio work; it is not as intensive as Cardio Burn, but is a good ""medium"" cardio blend.  The remaining 20 minutes are spent doing weight and lower body work, again, while appreciated, there is not enough time to really get a good workout.  Thus, it doesn't appear that the Firm knew where they were going when they produced this workout.  That being said, I use this tape when I have nominal time to spend exercising and want to get my heart rate up, or I run a couple of miles before hand and just do the cardio section as a supplement. Dale is a good instructor.",1168732800,,642,4.2809917355371905
8052541,5,B0007W4IO0,"at collage video's website....it is a high intensity, high impact workout, that not everyone loves. If newbies are wondering, this is NOT a new video, it is Power Cardio renamed from 1999.  I am glad it is out on DVD now, as people were paying through the nose for the VHS version.  I wonder why amazon isn't selling it?

It is a great workout, it is short (compared to 1hr, or longer workouts) it is 45 minutes.  If you have Cardio Burn or Maximum Burn, which also came out around the same time, you will probably enjoy this workout too! (but check out reviews first!)",1137196800,16,569,4.390476190476191
