8270866,5,B0018S4VBW,"These 1985 - 1988 series from ITV are the gentle, inoffensive comedies that should offend no one.  In addition to the three series staring James Bolam (New Tricks), Barbara Flynn (Cracker, the Cranford stories) and Dudley Sutton (Lovejoy); my 21st Anniversary Edition included the precursor series, Get Lost.  These 4 episodes starred Alun Armstrong (New Tricks) when he had curly hair and Bridget Turner.  There is also a 15 track CD of the soundtrack and a 47 page tome about the series.  I remember enjoying this when it first aired and it's just a good again this time - especially with all the extras.",1428105600,2,606,4.798076923076923
8270867,4,B0018S4VBW,"The Beiderbecke Trilogy is a collection of three series of a light-hearted British mystery/comedy/drama. It gives us each of the short series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Affair/dp/B001HZ4K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Affair</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Tapes/dp/B001V7YZEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Tapes</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Connection/dp/B002V3AM3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Connection</a>.  It was made by Yorkshire TV, and set in that part of the U.K, I imagine; it was created by the award-winning Alan Plater, one of Britain's more prolific, entertaining writers, based on his own novels. The entire series was broadcast in the U.S. on public TV.  Be forewarned, however, neither the visual nor the audio quality is what you would expect in a contemporary work: this series was made quite some time ago.  Also, unfortunately, there are no subtitles.

It makes for tough going for some of us, who may miss some of the witty byplay among the characters. But the plot is easy enough to follow.

The entertainment centers on a pair of wisecracking Leeds schoolteachers (and we don't often see Leeds on our side of the pond), caught up in some amateur sleuthing.  Jill Swinburne (Flynn) teaches English and wants to save the world. Trevor Chaplin (Bolam) is a befuddled but witty everyman, who teaches woodworking and loves jazz, particularly Bix Beiderbecke, a 1920s American jazz great.  Dudley Sutton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lovejoy-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B002DY9KRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lovejoy: The Complete Collection</a>) has a supporting role as Mr. Carter, history teacher, at the dilapidated local school, known as San Quentin High, where they work. Further adding greatly to the fun is Terence Rigby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Tailor-Soldier-Spy/dp/B00006A8T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>) as Big Al.

Other notable supporting stars are Beryl Reid, (TINKER TAILOR), Colin Blakely(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Among-the-Ruins-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Spain/dp/B0035G77O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Among the Ruins  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Spain </a>]) and James Grout.

THE BEIDERBECKE AFFAIR is about the ""grey"" economy (the buying and selling of ""legitimate"" merchandise, without  the bother of taxes, nor the upkeep of a shop).Trevor  purchases  some Beiderbecke jazz records--and I do mean vinyl records--from, oddly enough, a beautiful blond selling door to door.  This unorthodox purchase, predictably, does not go as he expected.  And then Chaplin discovers that the people he's bought the records from are under police surveillance. In short order, he and his partner Jill, find themselves making midnight assignations on multi-story car parks.  They find they must deal with corruption and collusion between big business, the local council and the police.

THE BEIDERBECKE TAPES, the second series, was to me the weakest of the three.  The tape, supposedly of Beiderbecke music that is at the center of the story is two degrees removed from any sort of reality.  And there's just not much going on.

THE BEIDERBECKE CONNECTION, the third series, was the most enjoyable to me.  It's much more reality-based, for a start.  In it, Trevor and Jill, now settled down, and parents of a darling baby boy, agree to take in the Russian refugee Ivan, who is not so terrible, for the night. But Ivan comes trailing a significant back story that interests the police, and influences the couple's lives.

Of course, the mysteries move along in a leisurely, gentle British fashion that may be too slow for some viewers. But the banter's consistently wry and witty. So is the rollicking sound track, inspired by Beiderbecke's work, by the BAFTA award-winning musician Frank Ricotti (the BAFTA is the British Oscar equivalent): on the track, furthermore, we hear solos by jazz great Kenny Baker. Alan Plater's credits include THE LAST OF THE BLONDE BOMBSHELLS; OLIVERS TRAVELS, and A VERY BRITISH COUP.  There is no onscreen violence, nor sex, for that matter. All concerned keep their clothes on, which is probably just as well, as all concerned are at least middle aged. And for some of us, a middle aged romance is really rewarding. The script is as light in weight as the production is light of heart, not to be taken too seriously, served up with heaping helpings of charm and whimsy.  It may remind a viewer of the zany mysteries of the 1930s and `40s, Nick and Nora falling a couple of ranks socially and economically, but still having fun.  Most viewers will too.",1298419200,10,6235,6.695167286245353
8270868,4,B0018S4VBW,"There are no extras and the film quality is good, but not crystal clear (remember this was made before the digital age really took off). Typical of its time, this is a slow-paced, sedate, gentle, wry comedy. Today's MTV generation may find it a little toooo slow.

The three stories that make up the trilogy are executed with varying degrees of success. The first, about the ""grey"" economy (buying and selling ""legitimate"" merchandise, without all the hassle of taxes and shops rents and the kind of secret handshaking that goes on between big businesses to control the market) is the best. Trevor Chaplin's purchase of some jazz records does not go as expected. Worse, the people he's bought them from are being investigated by the police. In order to extricate himself from the mess, he and his partner, Jill Swinburn, together with Big Al and Little Norm, must deal with corruption and collusion between big business, the local council and the people in blue.

The second, the Beiderbecke Tapes, is the least satisfactory, partly due to a compromise in Location (Edinburgh substituted for Venice) and partly because the chase sequence, being very laboured, outstays its welcome very quickly. Mostly, however, it's because the McGuffin at the center of the story is totally senseless.

The final story, the Beiderbecke Connection, returns the duo to Leeds and Wakefield and their association with Big Al and Little Norm. The story is more satisfying, because it's on a much more realistic level. Jill and Trevor take in a refugee for Al and Norm, ignorant of the fact that he's wanted by the police. The plot leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth these days, where cybercrime and financial irregularities are taken much more seriously, but even back then, this was the most cynical and scathing outlook on British culture, the tone coming dangerously close to its contemporary, A Very Peculiar Practice.

The stories are deliberately slight and understated. This is light comedy, producing wry, knowing smiles, gently parodying hard crime dramas and, more prosaically, the teaching profession. At its best, the warmth of the relationship between Jill and Trevor, their astute, sardonic commentary and the portrayal of the British way of life as one of adversity in the face of overwhelming stupidity, are what carry the audience forward.

Recommended, but don't expect belly laughs or high drama.",1291507200,4,2401,5.083756345177665
