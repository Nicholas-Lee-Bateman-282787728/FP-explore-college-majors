2220517,5,B0007N1AM2,"Miracles was a brilliant series that had so many possibilities and was only beginning to go places.  It's BIGGEST problems were a LACK OF PROMOTION by it's network and of course, the beginning of the WAR.  As one of many fans who continually flock to [...] in hopes of a Star Trek-like resurrection of this series, I am thankful for the complete First-Season release of this phenomenal show. Obviously someone was listening and if we (the fans) have managed to accomplish this (the DVD release of this series), then who knows where else this might take us...",1111363200,,558,4.742268041237113
2220518,5,B0007N1AM2,"This show was one of the best shows that once again, was never given a chance.  I watched most of its run on ABC, which was hard, since it was aired unevenly, and I often didn't know whether it was supposed to be on or not.

I was quite sad to find that it had been cancelled. My mom was sad as well, since I had gotten her hooked on it too :)

Anyway, I loved the show's most thought provoking quote ""God is Now here."" It's a big deal in the series, as you will find that it is the first time that those words had ever appeared (written in blood), because previously, anytime they had been written, it was ""God is nowhere.""

Very intense show that made you think.  I especially loved the Airplane episode, where everyone gets their wish. It had a touching side story of true unconditional love.

This show, by Angel co-creator David Greenwalt, was a gem that wasn't allowed to see the light.  Buy/pre-order this and treat yourself to some very smart ideas regarding religion mythos (even if you are not religious, it's a good character driven show.)

Just a little bit of trivia.  In Angel's season 4, there is a shout-out to this show (it had already being cancelled) where they have a chuch with a sign saying ""God is Nowhere.""",1111363200,27,1230,4.359649122807017
2220519,5,B0007N1AM2,"I would race home after class to catch the show because as an atheist it is very interesting.  Only a few episodes aired because it was constantly being interupted by a less than mediocre show (the practice).  I enjoyed this show immensely and it was canceled entirely too soon.
The series is about a guy, Paul Callan, who until recently investigated miracles for the Catholic Church.  During an investigation of a boy named Tommy, Paul is involved in a horrific train accident and he sees the message 'GOD IS NOWHERE' written in his own blood.  He returned to report his findings and the church denies ever sending him to investigate Tommy.  This causes Paul to take a break from the church.  Then Paul meets Alva Keel and Evelyn Santos, two people who investigate paranormal incidents.  Paul joins the team in order to find answers, which Alva says he has.",1110931200,6,858,4.718120805369128
2220520,5,B0007N1AM2,"A gem of a series that got canceled way too soon. As pointed out, this show was killed not because of any controversy, but because of the war in Iraq. After three airings, ABC pre-empted the Monday timeslot three out of four weeks. By the time the three remaining episodes saw the light of day, the only ones watching were the dedicated Angel fans who loved David Greenwalt's work. So despite critical praise, the show vanished. Like Wonderfalls, here was another character driven show in an age of only plot driven fodder like the CSI and Law & Order franchise. Like most networks over the last few years, they don't know what to do with shows that put character development over predictable action, sex and violence. So ABC stumbled and thusly had no faith in that viewers would find the show. Had they been smart -and had wanted to keep the show - they should've started reairing the show in April of 2003, but that opened a whole barrel of over issues. Still, they could've saved it for the summer or even held it back until late August. Whatever, I am glad this show is coming to DVD. It deserves to be seen, and while I'm sure only Buffy and Angel fans will buy this, maybe we can convince more people outside those two franchises to buy it. I mean, I showed a friend Wonderfalls, and he was so impressed with -at the time he first though this was an Ally McBeal rip-off - he went out an bought the set. I was happy. This show should've continued. Maybe, if enough people buy this, someone might be convinced to do a big screen version. It is that good.",1109980800,26,1559,4.416666666666667
2220521,5,B0007N1AM2,"this show was awesome and imo its better than any supernatural show on tv today(non cable). i wish abc had understood the potential this show had and the following that it would have attracted. when the show was on the air it made some decent ratings overall especially for the 9pm cst on sundays. i think abc got scared because of the low ratings buffy was getting on upn. i assume that abc thought that the supernatural/superhero genre was a fad that was dying away. that was also the year that reality tv started to take off. Now there isn't anything worth watching on tv in the supernatural genre and if abc had stuck with this show maybe they would have two hit shows. everybody should buy the dvd so that the miracles people can finish the series.

2220522,5,B0007N1AM2,"this is a show that was in awe of the miraculous, had a lot of heart, and some of the best performances you will ever see in a one hour suspense drama. the most exciting part of this DVD is it contains five or six episodes that were completed but never aired on television.

it does need to be said however, that the show certainly was not canceled because it was controversial (it wasn't) it was not canceled because it ""took on"" the Catholic church (it didn't) the show was canceled because of a little war in Iraq began just a few weeks into the show's run, so Miracles was preempted several weeks in a row due to war coverage, by the time the show aired again, although critically acclaimed, nobody watched it. simple as that. which makes it all the more cool that it is being released in this format, for everyone to enjoy.",1109376000,6,828,4.341935483870968
2220523,5,B0007N1AM2,"Obviously I haven't seen the actual DVD yet but will soon, as they will be released in about two months and I'm definitely preordering.  This series was a political hot potato that ABC took a chance on because of its quality and potential, but any broadcast network show that blatantly takes on the Catholic church (by making the higher-ups look like bloodless bureaucrats) must expect some fallout.  They got it, and since the ratings weren't spectacular ""Miracles"" flailed and was yanked from the spring 2004 schedule.  Definite candidate for Trio's ""Brilliant But Cancelled"" showcase.

So, what is ""Miracles""?  It's a kind of amalgam of ""The X-Files,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""The Twilight Zone,"" just to give you a feel for what the show is like in general.  It's about a young priest (Skeet Ulrich) whose job is to investigate alleged miracles, with an eye to authenticating any such legitimate event.  These miracles are always bogus, and he is therefore brought to a place where he has serious doubts about his faith, and when he is the beneficiary of what he believes to be an actual miracle that his higher-ups don't want to know about, he quits his job and finds his way to employment with a fellow investigator (Angus McFadyen) who is investigating the same thing....but has some disturbing information about the miracle the younger priest had experienced.

I've been scrounging the 'net for months waiting for a DVD to be made available, and here it is.  Although there are only 13 episodes and obviously there'll be no final payoff of the story, the episodes I saw in the U.S. were extraordinary in terms of stories and production values.  Ulrich is not the greatest actor in the world, but neither was David Duchovny of ""The X-Files,"" so I can live with that.  These are fascinating tales of imaginative fiction, and most shortcomings can be overlooked.

It's not surprising that a TV series of this quality would fall through the cracks in these days of reality TV and the need of the networks to cut costs (mediocre ratings not acceptable unless program is relatively cheap to produce, as are reality and news shows), so let's just be happy ""Miracles"" was given the go-ahead in the first place....although ABC ultimately displayed the typical network short-sightedness of axing a program that had just begun to find its audience.",1109203200,8,2341,4.913705583756345

2220532,5,B0007N1AM2,"Another GREAT series cancelled prematurely by the nitwits at AB-Now-You-""C""-It-Now-You-Don't"" (I can go all the way back to ABC shows such as ""Tenspeed & Brownshoe"" (circa 1980) or all the way up to ABC shows like ""Life On Mars"" (circa 2009 and the LAST network TV show I bothered watching regularly) while hitting a lot of great, prematurely dumped shows in between. ""Miracles"" had thoughtful writing, solid acting (gotta love the Skeeter!) and the beginnings of an intricate story line involving a Miracle-busting Paul Callan (Skeet Ulrich) who works for the Catholic church investigating purported signs of Godly presence. Weave in a great role for Hector Elizondo and you have all the makings of an innovative, original drama--just the kind of offering ABC was itchin' to dump. So, when the head program guy at ABC caught his own reflection in the mirror, he apparently became too distracted to restore ""Miracles"" to a decent, consistent time slot after the network was done with its ratings darling of the week--its news coverage of ""shock and awe"" in Iraq.

""Miracles"" is one of the reasons viewers should NEVER watch network TV shows until they've been on at least three years. DON'T make an emotional commitment to a show if the networks aren't willing to do the same. Once a show's been on for three years, you'll at least be able to view a decent number of episodes via DVD, downloading, NetFlix, etc. In the short term, yes, this will cause more good shows to get cancelled while the broadcast networks learn their lesson (and remember, they're VERY slow learners). Over time, however, ABC (and, to a lesser extent, CBS, NBC and FOX) will learn American viewers aren't going to get attached to good quality dramas knowing they may get axed in favor of the next ""America's Got X-Factors Dancing With the Survivors"" knockoff. And maybe that'll make them not jerk around with their schedules so much that they preclude great shows like ""Miracles"" from developing a regular weekly following (remember, ""Cheers"" had horrendous ratings its first year, but NBC stuck with it and it became one of the most beloved, and popular shows of all time--not to mention spawning an excellent spinoff with ""Frazier""). Or, maybe it'll just drive us to watch more shows on cable networks, which is where ""Miracles"" would have thrived if given half a chance...

Remember, more frequently than not, ABC stands for ""Already Been Cancelled"". Make them stop! Or, for those few souls who actually had a chance to watch ""Miracles"", visualize a world where it's not ""ABC is Now Here""; it's ""ABC is Nowhere"".",1372809600,,2590,4.924485125858124

2220534,5,B0007N1AM2,"Paul Callan investigates modern miracles. Over the years, his faith has been tested and diminished. Most so called miracles have a very mundane explaination, but Paul is about to find that real miracles do exist. They do come at a price though. Paul is hit bay a train and saved by a young boy. The boy used his healing power to save Paul's life, at the price of his own. Before the boy dies, he and Paul both see the words, ""God is now here"", written in Paul's blood. Paul then decides to go on a spiritual journey to find the significance of those words.

I received this series as a gift from my Dad. He read a review on it and decided to give it a shot. He then mailed it to me raving about how awesome it is. It really is awesome. It has great acting, intense and heavy subject matter, tons of emotion and beautiful meaningful spiritual messages. I have witnessed the things that some would call miracles. I think that they exist, but most people will never experience them. I have faith, but began to believe that I would never see anything to prove that my beliefs were correct. Lot's of folks probably feel the same way. This show gave me a little extra confidence. Maybe if I continue to have faith, I will witness something even more beautiful and miraculous. Just maybe, someday, I'll have the proof that I need to say ""yeah, miracles do exist"".

There are 3 members on the paranormal investigation team: Skeet Ulrich as Paul Callan, Angus Macfadyen as Alva Keel, and Marisa Ramirez as Evelyn Santos!

Some of the episodes are sad, some impressive, and some will simply stir ur emotions and leave u touched! From the first to the last one, I can't think of a single episode that seemed boring or awkward!

2220537,5,B0007N1AM2,"I never saw this series on TV. I bought it out of curiosity after re watching ""Jericho"" and seeing a cross reference. This was surprisingly good, though a bit rough. We did watch the whole series in under two days. Just kept wanting to see what would happen next. This series had real potential but I guess never picked up too many viewers. Some episodes are absorbing. Skeet Ulrich seems very uncomfortable initially as a un professed priest, but more believable as a former seminarian and an investigator of the paranormal. He has special feel or connection to the supernatural world which he doesn't quite know how to integrate in his life. You could really pick apart a few things, but it is better just to enjoy the stories and let them take you along.

It was weird the directors or writers seem to think the Catholic church still commonly uses a Latin rite. One of those TV things. More spooky that way. I half expected that Paul Cullen would be revealed as another Damien due to his background as an orphan, his supernatural vibe, and the East Coast setting. What is there is of this series can be enjoyed, even if you can tell there are bits to be filled in and finished. No regrets on the purchase and will watch it again some rainy weekend this winter.

Side comment-
Skeet Ulrich looks very natural with kids on screen. He really seems to connect with them, even when they are ghosts. It seems like he ought to be cast in roles were he interacts even more with juveniles, perhaps as a slightly edgy or intense sports coach, teacher, youth probation officer, single Dad, etc. Wish there was more out there for him, he's very enjoyable to watch in roles that play to his strengths.",1337904000,,1691,4.540983606557377

Instead, right off, he quits the church and goes free-lance, a la Ghost Whisperer. (The show quickly descends into ""Hollywood scary movie tripe"" as its bread and butter.)

These occurrences cannot be explained by laws of reason or logic.  Each episode takes you on a journey of mystery and intrigue.  It is often dark but you can't turn away.  The writing is excellent-the actors make you care about the characters.  Each member of the team is brought to this time for different reasons.  It is a show that touches your emotions-all of them.  One moment you will feel hope and then the next, you feel fear.  But, over all, you are on the edge of your seats-not sure where the journey will take you-but, you must continue.  There are only 13 episodes, the last 7 were never aired.  As much as I love each episode, my favorites were these last ones.

I hope they do with this like they did with Firefly.  Firefly got canceled in its first season yet was a very popular show.  Anyway, they made the movie Serenity to kinda finish the Firefly storyline.  Maybe, HOPEFULLY, the creators of Miracles will do the same.

2220554,5,B0007N1AM2,"My favorite genre of television is sci-fi and/or the paranormal.  I am highly critical, normally of any show that attempts to duplicate the X-Files.  It seems that most paranormal shows borrow quite a bit from the Files, and it's a rare show about the supernatural that differentiates itself from the pack.  Having said all that, I heartily recommend `Miracles' staring the vastly underrated Skeet Ulrich (the current star of the hit series;  `Jericho.')

  The premise of the show is never full explained since it was canceled 6 shows into production by ABC despite critical acclaim.  It essentially is about a small group of people dedicated to find the source of real supernatural miracles.  Everything from possession, stigmata, ghosts, and clairvoyance is represented in a thinking-man's presentation.  Ulrich and Angus MacFayden are superb as the chief two investigators:  Ulrich as a disillusioned Catholic priest on a mission to find answers and to understand who and what he is; MacFayden as the trained supernatural expert.

  The original series had 13 episodes, but only 6 made it on the airwaves.  For the fans of the one-year run, seeing an additional 7 first-class episodes is well-worth the price of the DVD boxset just by itself.  ""Miracles"" avoids the pitfall of being too one-sided for or against religion:  rather, we are left the impression that the miracles the team finds may or may not have come from God Himself.  For fans of the supernatural, this show is a natural:  a must buy.  A one-year jewel, we may never find out the conclusion of the show since it suffered a premature burial.

I can highly recommend Miracles! It is captivating, intriguing and just simply put Very, Very Good.
If you liked the x-files, if you like supernatural stuff, then you are going to like Miracles. Skeet Ulrich and Angus Macfayden both deliver amazing acting performances and are just a true joy to watch... Go check it out, you won't regret it!",1201737600,,536,4.652631578947369
2220556,4,B0007N1AM2,I watched the first few episodes when this was on the air.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Skeet Ulrich is great.  It can make you think.  I just wish the series had been given a real chance to prove itself.,1201046400,,212,3.75

2220558,5,B0007N1AM2,Their excuse for cancellation was the coverage of the war.  I say most of these series (like Miracles) aren't given a chance.  Television executives are into reality TV these days and never consider the silent majority and their taste.  I applauded the fans of Jericho who brought the cancelled show back for another year.  I guess that's what we need to do.  Bombard the networks with emails and threats to boycott. I'm happy I have Miracles on DVD.  At least I can watch the 13 episodes.,1188950400,,489,4.627906976744186

2220560,5,B0007N1AM2,"As usual, a series way ahead of its time.  Edgy, complex, well acted, the series can both creep you out or make you laugh (See disc 3, ""Battle of Shadow Ridge""). The series box also gives you those extra bonus episodes that were never aired making it worth the price.

A few actors currently seen in the popular tv show ""Lost""(Maggie Grace, to name one) are fun to see, not to mention one episode that you can imagine may or may not have been the inspiration for ""Lost"" ( watch ""The Friendly Skies"" disc 1). Great fun for sleepovers and Halloween or just that rainy night or two!",1178928000,,579,4.351851851851852
2220561,5,B0007N1AM2,I never seen the series on regular tv. I wasn't a regular viewer of the X FILES which many compare it too due to the unbelievable nature of its subject matter. . But i like the stories tackled in MIRACLES. i found myself getting through this dvd set very quckly as i wanted to move on from one incredible story to the next. I like the cast and the theme which is well described in product overview. This was a short lived series which I AM VERY GLAD i found . It was better than a movie and i got to enjoy several Miraculous hours of MIRACLES. You should too. The series will touch some emotions to be sure. This one stays in my personal collection so i can share it with my family.,1178236800,2,682,4.097014925373134
2220562,4,B0007N1AM2,"The first thing I recall about this series is how good it looked.  There was a lot of first rate cinematography involved in its making.  The premise is also engaging, and the characters had a lot of room for development, which is what you want in a new series.  Unfortunately, very little of the series was aired or shot.  Definitely worth watching, an unfortunate casualty to early cancellation.",1174262400,2,396,4.779411764705882
2220563,5,B0007N1AM2,"This well-acted, sensitively-written and thought-provoking ABC series undeservedly ended before it began. The underrated Skeet Ulrich is in top form as tortured Paul Callan, exhibiting an adeptness at sensitivity and skill while effortlessly displaying a selfless beauty and sensuality.

Scottish character actor Angus McFayden lends solid support (and intermittent quirkiness) as the complex and oftentimes mysterious head of the struggling organization investigating miracles.

Marisa Ramirez - more than just a pretty face - holds her own with a radiance lacking in many actresses of her generation.

A roster of fine guest stars compliments the clever storylines. Always-reliable Hector Elizondo offers steadfast support as the priest who raised Paul in an orphanage. Here is a gem to discover (or re-discover) on DVD, a rich collection that includes insightful extras and absorbing commentary. It doesn't take a seance to witness the love and care that obviously went into this production; if this gem of a series has yet to materialize in your DVD player, get into the spirit!",1172707200,2,1082,5.506024096385542
2220564,5,B0007N1AM2,...and am surprised that the series was cancelled. They were certainly better than some of the like type of shows that are still out there. I thought them creative and they held my interest. I believe that sometimes a show just doesn't get enough hype in the beginning...as I for one was never aware this series even existed until I found the boxed set on Amazon. Sad.,1170720000,,368,4.507462686567164

2220566,5,B0007N1AM2,"I love the series, but it obvious that it was cut short, well before coming into its full potential for a large following.

2220567,1,B0007N1AM2,"I tried my best to keep an open mind! Miracles  borders on camp. Storylines make no sense. The boy ghost says the evil spirit wants everything. Really now? That's a truly exciting revelation! Especially when in an earlier episode, at his funeral, the same boy ghost shows up all happy, and at peace. We are led to believe there's closure. Can't the writers make-up their minds? Or, are they trying to save money by not hiring more actors!

One episode even turned an old lady into jelly! She caves in and tells her deep, dark secret because one of our fearless investigators had the audacity to ask  twice. Wow! That would convince me to spill the beans to a bunch of strangers after keeping my mouth shut for well over 50 years!

The acting is not inspiring,  either. There's no chemistry.  At times I get the feeling the main characters don't know if they are going to be filming the next episode. Sometimes it seems like the actors are trying hard not to giggle. Keep in mind this not supposed to a comedy show!

This series is a cross between X-files and Bewitched. A confusing mess to say the least! Good try, no cigar!",1157155200,4,1124,4.480392156862745
2220568,5,B0007N1AM2,"I enjoyed the few episodes I was able to watch when this was on the air.  I bought it as a gift for my mother, and I watched the DVDs while visiting her a couple of weeks ago.  I really wish this series had stayed on the air. The final episode was probably the most intriguing.  Yes, some of the episodes were better than others, but none of them left me regretting the time I spent watching them!

The DVDs also contain special features including an interesting interview with one of the creators of the series.",1153699200,4,512,4.302083333333333
2220569,4,B0007N1AM2,"I don't disagree with much of what has been said, but I did want to qualify something.  This series was actually on ABC, not Fox, which had been named.  This and the series, Veritas, were both midseason series, which held promise for those of us in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, but were both canceled within a few episodes.  Even when ABC was desperate, they still did not have much patience for this style of programming.  Thank God Lost found an audience right away!",1151193600,2,465,4.634146341463414
2220570,4,B0007N1AM2,"I loved this show and taped it when it aired.  And It's just as good as I remembered.  The writing, acting and directing on the show totally draws you in and really makes you hurt from the fact that you won't be able to share in more of the characters' lives now that the series is cancelled. The characters were so interesting, Alva Keel the enigmatic super genius, Evie Santos the ex-cop but feminine balance to the group and Paul Callan he who (with 6 other hemographists) has something to do with the end of the world.

I give it a 4 because the aired episodes were great but the some of the unaired episodes were a bit bland (even for the subtle, laid-back storytelling style).

Miracles is not a religious series, but it's just so lightly religiously flavored that it makes a Catholic like me feel at home.  Just as an aside, I really liked how it was respectable to the Catholic church in the series.  Portraying it as an standpoint standpoint of faith, but not villifying it like some judgmental and condemning institution. It was small touches like this to the show and it's themes that make the show so different that what you would normally see on TV.

I guess if you guys are looking for something along this line...Supernatural on the WB network is a much much dramatically scaled down, younger-handsome lead version of Miracles.  (They've already copied some of plots from Miracles including an abused kid taking paranormal revenge, like in the Bone Scatterer episode and the constant use of supernatural entities referring to the whereabouts of lead characters' loved ones.)",1148256000,4,1589,4.731884057971015
2220571,5,B0007N1AM2,"I did not catch this show when it was aired on tv.  I'm not sure why.  However, I bought the dvd set because the plot sounded promising.  It was a very exciting series.  I had trouble not watching episode after episode.  My only disappointment was that they couldn't go into more depth with some of the characters or find the last 3 people that experienced the hemography: God is No Where.  The series had potential to have a lot more interesting shows.

The name may have made me skeptical about the series because it sounds very religious but even though religion is brought up the show does not center around it.  It is more a show about the paranormal.  I really enjoyed watching the dvds and wish they would give this series another chance.",1144108800,2,745,4.5
2220572,5,B0007N1AM2,It was just a great as I remember.  I wish I had more episodes of this series to enjoy. Maybe some channel (other than ABC) could pick up this series again.

2220573,5,B0007N1AM2,I am very disappointed that this series only made it one season.  The glimpses into the paranormal were great and maintained a realistic nature to them.  This series will leave you wanting more.,1138579200,,194,4.848484848484849
2220574,5,B0007N1AM2,"Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed that the network didn't allow this show enough time to find an audience.  Surely much inferior shows have been given more of a chance than this!

Watching the episodes on DVD make the creepiest ones (like the pilot) even more intense because of the lack of commercials.  It's also interesting to see the unaired episodes, which do vary in quality.",1134259200,2,393,4.835820895522388
2220575,4,B0007N1AM2,"This show was gunned down way too soon.  I'm not too familiar with the reasons behind the executives canceling the show after just a short 1st season. Maybe it had to do with ratings or actor troubles, but from what I saw of only the first show's broadcast I knew that I was going to buy this TV show.

Sadly I joined the Army shortly after it started airing or else I would have gleefully watched the entire spellbinding season.  ""Miracles the Theatrical Movie"" would be a BLAST and would be a much better film the either Johnny Depp's "" Ninth Gate"" or Heath Ledger's ""The Order"".  Not to say that either of them was bad, they were both entertaining and well made.

I just think that with Miracles in your face tense shots (on some episodes) and quick acting (actor) and reacting (character) to the scene it would make for an excellent theatrical screen presence. If that is to say it could not be resurrected to a second season or series.

If you trust me then buy it. If you don't then rent it first, then buy it.  Either way Buy it.  :)

2220577,5,B0007N1AM2,"This show, like Firefly, was cancelled early in and in my opinion, unfairly. Between an interview with Michael Jackson by ""Bahbwah Wahwahs"" and the announcement and updates on Bush declaring war in Iraq, the show lost it's momentum (because all this happened on nights it was supposed to air), the show got cancelled like after 5-6 episodes - out of 13 or 14.

I and many people I know and have read about were really bummed about it getting cancelled.

However, I was in Best Buy the other day and just happened to see this beauty of a box set sitting on the shelf and I immediately picked it up. I've been watching through the aired ones again and I still enjoy them just as much as I did when they were on TV. It's such a wonderful show and you'd really be missing out if you didn't get to see them. I mean, honestly, if you liked X-Files, you'll like Miracles, plain and simple.

The jet airliner episode is the first show, TV or movie, that actually managed to make me tear up. That says a lot.

Anyway, I just wanted to pass on my recommedation of a really good show. If word of mouth saved Firefly, I'd like to see if it can help Miracles, too.",1125360000,6,1151,4.26605504587156
2220578,4,B0007N1AM2,"I'm so fed up with broadcast corporations cancelling shows that have even the slightest hint of cerebral value. FOX tops my list of stations that have an almost A.D.D. style of shoot and cancel -- they did the same thing to WONDERFALLS, another fine series that made you think.

MIRACLES was off to an excellent start: put a young man in the priesthood on a special Catholic task force who's sole purpose is to seek out reported miracles in the world, then report back to a cardinal as to if they were real, fake, or unknown. Paul Callan (Skeet Ulrich, Scream) is this one-man force who has science, religion, and a wobbling faith all tied up inside himself. MIRACLES starts out showing us this dark man visiting a cemetery being moved. When they dig up the coffins, a nun who was buried there falls out of the bottom of her casket. And she's in perfect condition, even though she's been dead for 160 years. Come to find out, the graveyard is sitting next to an apricot orchard, and apricots have a preservative effect. Paul realizes this immediately and kicks open a few other coffins to prove it -- inside those are perfectly preserved corpses, too. Thus we get to see that Paul isn't looking for miracles, but is simply trying to give credence to the unexplained.

Also in the first episode, we get to see Paul nearly killed in a train versus automobile crash. While lying in the crumpled car, he sees his blood on the windshield; and it forms a sentence (this is called Hemography) that reads ""God is now here."" And then a young boy (whom he'd been investigating because of claims that the boy healed with a touch of his hands, but then became ill after each ""healing"") comes to him and heals Paul ...then the boy dies. When Paul reports back to the cardinal about what he'd experienced, the cardinal dismisses his claim, so Paul up and quits the church. But in the wings is waiting a man who runs a special paranormal research agency. Alva Keel (Angus Macfadyen, Braveheart) becomes Paul's new boss, and the discoveries they make are terribly disturbing.

Apparently, most people who've seen the message that Paul saw in his blood didn't see ""God is now here."" They saw ""God is nowhere."" And so begins their spiritual, paranormal, and dark journey.

The thing that bugged me most about this series was its title, MIRACLES. I didn't see most of what they found to be miraculous as much as disturbingly dangerous. But even so, the series held together pretty well regardless of its name.

Paul has to try and overcome the fact that he was saved by a child who gave up his life for Paul's. This horrible event haunts Paul throughout the series as we repeatedly witness his visions and dreams of the boy, eyes bleeding, face gaunt, hair falling out.

It is worth noting, too, that this series has very little in the way of spiritual upliftingness. There are touches of it, but mostly the episodes hit on something dark coming, something terrible. The apocalypse maybe?

The viewer is never given any insight into what exactly is in store for Paul and his paranormal investigations. And, unfortunately, we'll never really know for sure since the show was cancelled (can I bare my b&tt so that FOX executives can kiss it!)

But I do have a theory of my own. Paul was an orphan and never knew his mother or father, and this plays a vital part of Paul's character and how we view him. He's a loner, but a good person at heart. He's just suffering over what to do with his questioning faith in ...everything. But everyone in the series wants to be near him and trusts him. He also goes through Hell on Earth; during his investigations he almost always gets the cr@p beat out of him, only to recover and move on to the next case. I think he was being set up for something large and important; perhaps to become an angel or a type of disciple for the next coming.

But, again, who knows. FOX's idiocy has ruined another great character show. Morons!

I didn't give the show 5 stars because some of the episodes were pretty pedestrian in nature and easy to figure out, but the acting, excellent filming, and haunting music all made this a very watchable series.",1125014400,50,4154,4.571236559139785
2220579,5,B0007N1AM2,"This dvd has turned out to be one of my faverites. I had not seen the series before I purchased it, but I had seen Skeet Ulrich in ""Touch"" and I knew he would be great in this series!

I love shows about the paranormal.  I loved everything about this show.  The actors were all really talented and they brought a really intense energy to the show. It's a real shame there was only one season because I wanted to see more.. more... more...!

I would love to see a movie to continue the story, but only if it has all the original cast. ""Firefly"" has a movie coming soon to finish their story, so why not ""Miracles""?  I, for one, would love to see the ""GOD IS NOWHERE"" and ""GOD IS NOW HERE"" storyline explored a little further.",1124496000,4,724,4.179856115107913

It's too bad that the set is in full screen rather than widescreen, and some of the scenes are a little dark, but this doesn't detract from the overall impact of the stories.  The audio commentaries are interesting, and well worth a listen.  There are lot's of deleted scenes, which are always fun to see.  This series was amazingly written, with thought provoking stories.  The characters are likeable, but flawed human beings, as so many of us are.  You are very quickly drawn into their world.  The on screen intensity of the actors is amazing.  It is definetly a series that you can watch again and again, and with each viewing find something that you missed before.

 The episodes i hadn't seen were very well done: 'the battle at Shadow ridge', it totally gripped me, with the idea of the two timeline existing along side each other and the last episod 'paul is dead' has to be seen to be believed, though nothing got tied up, who was coming what happened to the remaining people who saw the same sign in blood, were they really the threat, would they really have to be stopped, and would paul have to do it, what does it really all mean, How was paul holding on to Tommy, questions we'll never have answered, but it was a great ride while it lasted it's just too bad that really great shows don't seem to get a chance to see what they could be, and i think Miracles could have been a great one, skeet ulrich was a great lead, and i would've liked to see how the relationship, workwise and personally developed between him and Angus Macfadyen, (who i think is just brilliant) especially how they tried to go on after the secrets, anyway, i'm proud to have miracles as part of my collection, and if your into shows like the x-files or Buffy, i think you'll enjoy Miracles, i certainly did.",1122940800,,1371,4.310077519379845

A tortured male lead, a female partner, she gets about 6 lines a show (but of course is a knock out), and a boss who speaks a least 10 languages(not exagerating).  They investigate a lot of very ordinary cases.  The lead always gets beat up and falls for someone he meets on the case and the boss has lot of cut aways where he is looking Oh so serious.  A priest/friend is his conscience, but he's not even sure he believes in God and here is a waste of great talent. There are 13 shows.

Miracles (an unfortunate title that was too ""PAX"" for its own good) was interesting - arresting in fact.  The tone, the scripts, the direction/acting and the stunning visuals all combined to promise a season of entertainment.  But after the third week it got lost. If this program had come along after ABC experienced success with this season's hit ""LOST"" the network might have understood what they had in this series. As it is, I cannot imagine what programming they had at that time that they believed would be better than Miracles.

Yesterday I found the DVD of the series, purchased it with great anticipation and watched it immediately.  It is just as unique and compelling as I had expected.  All of the elements that made the show stand out from the ordinary are consistent throughout the 13 episodes included. The commentary is very useful, providing the usual background information and more.... additional discussions of the types of phenomena that Miracles portrayed.

I did recommend Miracles when it was running on ABC - and would have had an easier time of describing it had I thought to call it a spirital X-Files.  Now, I do highly recommend the DVD especially for those who enjoy the less violent, more hopeful visions of Steven King or Dean Koontz.",1117324800,7,1424,4.779591836734694
2220584,5,B0007N1AM2,"A higher reccomendation can't possibly be given.  The show is simply astonishing in it's unusually high grade of quality,  as the pilot episode alone almost has the same ""look"" as perhaps something you would see in a theater.

The acting of the core cast from Skeet Ulrich, Angus Macfayden and Marisa Ramirez (particularly Ulrich), along with the supporting players from each seperate episode, is among the best you'll find on television.  Add in breathtaking photography, music and brilliant writing and you pull together a program that's very well near flawless.

Take note, however, that what you get is pretty intense.  Not for the faint of heart, as ""Miracles"" is one of the most gripping rides you'll take stretched on your sofa.  Scary? You bet (perhaps even terrifying).  Emotionally moving? Keep the hankies close by.  And for the big cliche (sigh), one could even say truly inspiring.

The extras availble (deleted scenes, commentaries and creator interview) prove to be thoughtful touches, and give some needed insight as the series met a painfully early demise.

If you've ever doubted television can have true artistic merit and relevance, ""Miracles"" will make you a staunch believer of the opposite.  A knockout.",1115856000,7,1226,5.16751269035533

Loved the show when it was on TV a few years ago and was very unhappy to see it cancelled so quickly. However, having just watched the DVD's I must say that the unaired episodes generally don't match up to the ones we did see.

The series has an enticing plot line of ultimate good vs. ultimate evil with the character Paul somehow being the lynchpin. The episods that do focus more on this element are genreally fantastic. However, most of the unaired episodes have little to nothing to do with this plot line and are generally slow and unexciting. This series could have been something special if it had been more fast paced and had focused more on the previously mentioned plot line.

What you basically have here is the X-File syndrome - episodes which unravel the main mystery are great while the other episodes are B grade horror movies. Why did the creators not stick to the main storyline?",1115683200,7,1023,4.615384615384615

Skeet Ulrich is very handsome and talented, this is his best work ever. Angus Macfadyen seems very realistic and explaines occurances intellectually but in a way that anyone can understand. His character is very crucial to the success of this series. Marisa Ramirez is very sweet and brings a sense of calmness and assurance. Her characters law enforcement expertise does good for the team. It's too bad that this show had to end, it's like someone ripped out the ending pages of a great book. In my opinion this show would have been a great success.

And I still wonder if Paul has these special abilities because God is on his side OR if ""the dark"" is fighting with good to get Paul.",1114992000,3,728,4.15
2220589,5,B0007N1AM2,This has to be the best series I have ever watched.  It ended with many so many possabilities to more episodes that I hope they bring it back.  The acting is great and the stories really make you think.  Are these acts of God or acts from the other side...  If they came out with more episodes on DVD I would buy them too.,1114992000,2,322,3.984375
2220590,5,B0007N1AM2,"I've heard of this show by a review on one of a hundred of brazilian's sites on TV shows. The guy who wrote the comment was a big fan of the show and I decided to read something about it. I downloaded a video file from a link at TV Tome and got more interested. So, I decided to buy the DVD box and watch the episodes available. Man, one of the best TV shows I have ever watched. Richard Hatem is a genius. And you get more sure about this just by watching his interview on the extras. And it's not just something paranormal. You can see the drama on each episode. I've really cried watching a lot of them. Knowing the show got cancelled and how great it was makes me think what the problem would be for taking it back on TV. I know everyone has its own opinion, but I really recommend to all of those who read this to give Miracles a chance. At least, by buying the DVD box and getting a glimpse at what it is and what it could have been.",1114905600,4,939,3.9735449735449735
2220591,5,B0007N1AM2,"I wish, I wish they hadn't canceled this show.

Though this show is called ""Miracles"", I felt that it delt more with people and how they see/feel/change their universe, for better or worse.

I liked this show alot, and I feel that there is too much rubbish on TV and not enough of shows like this.",1114819200,4,297,4.285714285714286
2220592,5,B0007N1AM2,"This fantastic show was dropped because Michael Eisner of Disney didn't like it and Lloyd Braun, the president of ABC and Eisners lap dog, ordered that some lame show be put in its place after 6 episodes. Another reason for Eisners' ouster-his way be done, the audience be darned. The show premiered right after Superbowl XXXVI and grabbed a good sized audience. Now with Lloyd Braun and Eisner gone from ABC and Disney (parent company)

Now its your turn to watch and become entranced by the mystery of Miracles. The writing, subject matter and acting all combine to make a truly thoughtful and entertaining series killed in infancy by an uncaring and insensitive network. Purchase this DVD set-you'll wonder why we, the audience, tolerate the idiocy on network television when the true gems, like Miracles, get binned for no reason.",1114732800,6,834,4.957142857142857
2220593,5,B0007N1AM2,"TV today leaves much to be desired so it is hard to watch the DVDs of Miracles without having regret that it is not still a regular series.  ABC was on the cutting edge with this show and now is nowhere with the genre that NBC's Revelations is advancing.

Miracles is so good - appealing characters, suspense, great cinematography, and thought-provoking themes.  I'm not necessarily a fan of the paranormal, but bought the DVDs because I am a MAJOR fan of Skeet Ulrich, who of course is fabulous in this series.  However, I am very pleasantly surprised to be so thoroughly enjoying this series.

If you are sitting on the fence in purchasing this, BUY IT!  You won't regret it!",1114560000,4,677,4.6
2220594,5,B0007N1AM2,"Here is a program that is entertaining, provocative, and smart.  The subject matter is definately not for the little ones, however, here is a series which asked questions, asked you to open your mind and consider some things.  I'll take this type of entertainment over some of the mindless programming being offered today.  What a shame MIRACLES has not been given another chance by ABC or picked up by another network.  Thank you for putting the series out on DVD.  I am very happy to have this as part of my collection, and everyone I have shared it with so far feels the same way and is ordering their own set.  Maybe by some MIRACLE the series will be revived!",1114473600,5,664,4.491666666666666
2220595,5,B0007N1AM2,"I can't really add more than what has been already mentioned by the other reviews. If you are reading this do not hesitate to buy this dvd set as it is the best of all the shows ( for example Revelations on NBC ), who have attempted this. It is well made in every possible way, with some reality in just the pilot. Thanks to all involved in putting this dvd set together that allows us to see the entire run. By the way the one fact I find interesting in this type of program is that everyone is seeking the truth as if it isn't already here. You just have to want to know it, start looking for it, and then keep looking until you know yourself. It's not where truth is, but how truth is and was always given. Miracles exist. Find where they still believe in them. Ask.",1114300800,2,769,4.099337748344371
2220596,5,B0007N1AM2,"I finally got done watching all of the episodes of Miracles.  It only took me 2 days.  This show is addictive!  The plot was impressively addictive, always making me want to know more abou the Dark.  The sidelines were intriguing as well, and enough to keep me guessing.  It's sad that this show got taken off the air.  It has thought provoking ideas, decently complex characters.  I was introduced to the show right as it was going off the air.  If it came back on, as some do, I'd be a weekly watcher, and I hate serial tv shows.",1114214400,3,531,4.292929292929293
2220597,5,B0007N1AM2,"I received my pre-ordered dvd last Thursday. I was thrilled on the notion that I will be able to recapture this Tv show. One reviewer wrote: ""Quality shall find its audience."" This is the incontrovertible proof of such claim. Moreover, this would also advocate the idea that occasionally, we do not need the big networks dictating what audience would like and do not like. Most of the major networks today produce mediocre and insulting shows (e.g. one of the many fatuous shows is  ""The Simple Life,"" This particular show promotes the display of stupid and moronic acts  of two bratty girls, .). ""Miracles"" is  a show which proves that there are still people who have an excellent taste in choosing a show. Let the networks produce witless shows for witless audiences. Regarding miracles, it is poignant and provocative on the grounds that it makes the audiences contemplate matters regarding faith and intellect with the elements of thrills and suspense. As I have mentioned, so long as there are quality shows, quality audiences shall find their way. I do not regret Miracles having only a few episodes on the series. Quantity might jeopardize its quality.",1114128000,4,1159,4.963917525773196
2220598,5,B0007N1AM2,"It's gotten to the point where every single television show has an organized campaign to save it from cancellation either: (1) immediately after the Pilot is broadcast for the first time; or (2) after 5-10 years on the air. (I've never understood how a show with 100+ episodes in the can could be considered ""killed before its time.""  If the producers couldn't manage to tell all the stories they wanted to tell in 100-200 hours, then too bad. They HAD their chance.)

""Miracles"" is one of the few shows that did NOT have that chance - and more importantly - was WORTHY of having that chance. They packed more into the 6 aired episodes than most shows manage in three seasons. Combined with the 7 unaired episodes included in this set, it's indeed a marvel to behold, and nothing short of a ""miracle"" that the show was not shelved, never to be heard from again.

The show definitely suffered from bad timing when it premiered, but hats off to the network for recognizing that quality WILL find an audience, and releasing this terrific series on DVD.",1114128000,3,1049,4.629032258064516
2220599,5,B0007N1AM2,"I watched every episode of Miracles that ABC aired two years ago. Unfortunately, they chose to cancel the show before they even aired half of the episodes. Miracles is a feature-film quality show. The plots were so well thought out and the characters were so deep. I am still angry at ABC for not allowing this show it's proper shot at finding a big audience. Perhaps it was bad timing...all I know is that this was the only show that I have ever felt compelled to get involved in saving. Unfortunately, the Save the Miracles campaign could not bring the show back to tv, but now, with it's release on DVD, it is a victory for those of us who didn't ever get to see 7 of the 13 episodes. Watching the episodes I previously saw over the past couple of days only renews my enthusiasm for the show and deepens my sadness that we were never allowed the chance to follow Paul, Alva, and Evelyn through many adventures over multiple seasons. At least we do have proof that sometimes in tv, things do go right, even if dumb network executives fail to notice a gem when presented with one. I don't usually write reviews for products, but this show has a very special place in my heart and always will. If you buy this DVD set, you will definitely not regret it and you will treasure it always like me.",1114041600,6,1293,4.369294605809128
2220600,5,B0007N1AM2,"Other reviewers have done justice to the intelligence and unique themes of ""Miracles.""  Two additional factors that create the gripping atmosphere in this series are the cinematography/special effects, and the fine acting of Skeet Ulrich.  This series is beautifully shot, especially in the eery scenes and episodes that grab you and take you right into the mysterious relationships and events.  I cannot imagine this series without Skeet Ulrich as the paranormal investigator, Paul Callan.  He has become one of the finest actors, and his understated delivery, expressive features, and extraordinarily handsome face add his magnetism to this fascinating series.",1114041600,5,662,5.656565656565657

This series is incredible! The first day I got it I sat glued to my TV for the first 4 episodes and stayed up way too late. I don't understand why ABC cancelled it - this show is X-Files quality. I certainly hope they take a hint and bring it back.

I just wanted to add that I finished watching the entire series. I was not disappointed. Each episode just got better and better. However, I was sad when when I watched the last one because I knew it was over. This is really too bad, ABC should bring this show back!!",1114041600,5,692,3.8732394366197185

I couldn't be more happier.  It's unfortunate that ABC let this series go so early on.  I can only imagine how great it would have been to see Paul, Alva and Evie in a second season.  The show is dark, eerie and yet very bright and hopeful.  It's this contrast between light and dark that makes the show so enjoyable to watch, not to mention the wonderful actors involved.

2220604,5,B0007N1AM2,As seems to be the case with network television yet another show was cancelled  way too soon. Miracles was a great show that had much potential. The characters were believable and the stories kept one interested.  But ABC never gave it a chance. How did they expect a show to gain an audience when it was never aired on a regular basis? And then to not air all the episodes to the US market was horrible. At least we now have the series on DVD although I would much rather have it still on the air.,1113868800,4,498,4.177083333333333

I watched the first episode spellbound and was like Pavlov's dog wanting more!!!...LOL!!!...I told everyone I knew YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!...And then George W. and cronies decided to start a war in Iraq, just to throw this show off kilter..LOL!!!...Trying to find the times it would be on was like a maze, but the prize was worth it!...Great storylines, GREAT acting, and very spooky. One of the most intelligent shows to EVER be on! I would take my phone off the hook, and all my friends knew not to disturb me when this show was on...Check it out people, as you will not be sorry that you did.

I am thankful that the series has come to DVD and those who saw the first six eps. can follow a bit further in, and those who never saw it can have the opportunity to see it all.  This show was truly rare, giving the watchers a chance to think and leaving them with questions and theories on what they just saw.  If I could rate higher than 5, I would.

So when this came on, I found it to be a very intriging show. Of course ABC didn't give it the chance it deserved and it faded into the realm of shows that were good but cancelled too soon (like Wonderfalls). If they had stuck with it for a few more weeks, I think they may have had a hit on their hands but as we all know they didn't so by the ""miracle"" of DVD, we at least get to see the episodes they never televised.

Surprising that they are now going to air a simular show two years later called Revelations. Maybe they will give that more of a chance but maybe they won't. I'm not getting burned again so will not be sampling it.

Give this one a try though.",1112918400,10,807,3.9146341463414633

Now I can watch at my leisure. This show had good potential.  I was really pissed at ABC for cancelling it. Another season and it would have proven itself well worth keeping.

(And how many more head injuries Paul would have had without lasting damage.) Disliked the creators/writers POV commentary. I could see the longevity of the show was doomed from the start since they apparently would have pulled a LOST and let whimsy be their guide instead of their companion.
