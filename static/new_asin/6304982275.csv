7880564,3,6304982275,okay for some who don't mind an awful story made worse by the acting.  3 stars 'cause I couldn't believe what I was watching.....like a train wreck.,1511136000,,148,4.481481481481482
7880565,5,6304982275,I adore this movie because it has for of my favorite actors in it and I live the 40's-50's film noir feel to it. I wish I could find a cheaper price on the DVD because all I have is the vhs. Give it a try!,1404432000,,205,3.4782608695652173
7880566,5,6304982275,"Wonderfully odd picture. Zane, Gershon and Lee are totally committed to this deeply misanthropic story by one of America's loveliest literary brutes Jim Thompson.",1396742400,,162,5.791666666666667
7880567,1,6304982275,"The disc indicates optional subtitles but would not let me remove Dutch titles. Although the main track is English language,the Dutch subtitles cover 2/3 of the screen",1391558400,,167,5.222222222222222
7880568,3,6304982275,"This movie is only slightly above average, and baits you into staying tuned with occasional references to brother/sister incest. Baits, but never really delivers.

And the scene of just meeting a woman, and having instant sex in a nearby alley?  Hardly believable.

1940's Chicago. Clothes are Period Correct. Vehicles are standard Period Loaner Vehicles that look sparkly new, and too clean. Background scenery is Period Correct. Music is somewhat 1940's jazzy.

He is certainly no Dick Powell, as Detective Philip Marlowe, in Murder My Sweet, but the copycat effort is overly obvious. It doesn't work for Zane. He's too young. Too Handsome. And too over-confident. He doesn't even look right in the suits he wears.

The supporting actresses fall slightly short of being believable as well.

It is hard to dog any one characteristic as being completely off, however, the overall feel is the difference between a watch-once movie, and a keeper.

NOW, for the BIG disappointments, which cost this movie an additional star in my rating:
The movie, which I bought here on Amazon recently, is Region 2, which for me is no issue, since I have one ALL Region Up-scaling DVD player. For those of you with regular DVD players, this won't play on your machines.

BUT, the issue I hated most, is the non-removable Dutch subtitles in bold white letters on the bottom of the picture, which sometimes takes up 1/5 of the screen. When you load the DVD disk, there are no menu's. You go straight to the movie, with the subtitles. The spoken language is English.

If this movie were in the 10-20 dollar range, it might be worth a purchase. IF the Dutch subtitles were removable.",1382572800,,1662,4.865248226950355
7880569,5,6304982275,This title is unavailable on DVD and probably never will be. Billy Zane and Gina Gershon are at their steamy best. The story left me wondering if  brother (Zane) and sister (Gershon) were intimate - oh so deliciously vague.  Perfect vocals and musical score. Received in the condition offered. I'm completely satisfied.,1365984000,,319,5.115384615384615
7880570,4,6304982275,Dysfunctional characters well played by star actors.  Billy Zane is excellent in this film.  I can relate to the sometimes irrational logic of the lead actors' observations and actions.  Dark humor and snappy lines.  Would like to seek out the book it is based on and read it.,1304380800,,276,4.6875
7880571,4,6304982275,"This is not a film for everyone. It is dark, sultry, twisted and self indulgent, and that doesn't have mass appeal nowadays unless Quentin Tarantino is directing and people are shooting each other in the face. It  is, however, a terrific piece of filmmaking and as a fifties period piece  it is surpassed only by films actually made in the fifties.
It is the  story of brother and sister twins who were traumatized as children and turn  out quite screwed up as adults. There is the ever present hint of incest  looming in their relationship and they are both prone to lascivious  escapades. The story serves up a slice of their lustfully demented lives  together.
You almost have to be over 50 to appreciate this movie or be  someone who likes old black and white films from that era. Director Michael  Oblowitz has recreated not just the look, but the feel of the period. Tom  Priestly, who went on to be the cinematographer on ""The Thomas Crown  Affair"" did a fantastic job with filters and lighting to give the film an  authentic fifties feel. The sets, props, costumes and music were all  meticulously accurate. The use of a first person narrative (the story was  narrated by Marty [Billy Zane]) was a very popular device in 40's and 50's  films (think Humphrey Bogart).
Unfortunately, the film was more form than  substance since the story was a just meandering film noir libido ride.  Still, for fifties nostalgia buffs, this is a treat.
Gina Gershon was  fabulous as Carol. She was sexy, seductive, and lewd while simultaneously  being vulnerable and fragile. I can't remember seeing her in a role better  suited to her talents, nor can I remember her giving a better performance.  Billy Zane was really wrong for this part. His acting was fine, but it  failed to capture the character considering the context of the period. Men  of this period were known for their strength and impassive response to  almost everything. Naturally this would always lead to a great scene marked  by a fit of anger somewhere in the film as the pressure became too great  for him to bear. Zane was too mercurial in his portrayal of this character.  He had the male sex thing down, but he came across as shrill and defensive  in a lot of scenes, very un-fifties.
Sheryl Lee gave a terrific  performance as Lois, the sex crazed lady cop who becomes obsessed with  Marty. We may never hear from her again, but for one film she grabbed the  spotlight and ran with it. She was so desperately needy and shameless in  her appetite for Marty that it seemed she couldn't live unless she was  breathing the air he just exhaled.
I gave this film a 7/10. It is a 10 as  far as filmmaking and period authenticity and the story was about a 5. If  you like film noir, unabashed lust and the fifties, this movie is a must  see.",956102400,23,2799,4.583838383838384
