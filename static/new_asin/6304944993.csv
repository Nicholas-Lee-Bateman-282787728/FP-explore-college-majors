7879429,4,6304944993,"There are now two schools of thought re: ""doing"" yoga.  There is the tried and true historical version(s) and the ""let's re-write history version of exercise for the 21st century - go for the burn.""  I started doing yoga in the 70's with Lilias on PBS.  Took many yoga classes from some excellent instructors and still have a very thin volume (book) of Lilias' by which I taught myself many of the yoga poses.  Believe it or not, yoga does not start with Downward Facing Dog which is the catch pose of the 20-to-30-something person.  Last winter I started taking Yoga through a Fitness Center and when we were done, I walked up to the instructor and told her that I didn't remember yoga being so ""fast"".  She told me that yoga should bring up your heart rate.  Maybe, but yoga is not a cardio-vascular ""exercise"" like aerobic walking, boot camp, or spinning,etc.  The movements are meant to be slow for a reason. Yoga is a process of patience, not an immediate NOW gratification.

Lilias may be slow, but yoga is a combination of mind and body, not let's get that heart pumping as a measure of accomplishing the poses. I would strongly recommend her tapes and dvds for beginners, so YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF.  YOGA is not meant to ""hurt"" or ""burn"", ever.  A good foundation creates the concentration, strength and stamina to turn your body into a pretzel and to BREATHE correctly. With a little perserverance at any age, the rewards are remarkable. And, if you progress quickly to the next tapes/dvds - great, Lilias has done her job, and she knows it.  If you want the ""burn"" and pretty immediate results do Pilates.  Yoga is a lifetime achievement.",1191801600,11,1649,4.625429553264605
7879430,5,6304944993,"My Lilias Folan tapes: Daily Routine for Beginners are simply superb! Why? Because after performing the gentle yoga routines I feel such a sense of peace, well being and energy! Lilias is a natural teacher and her yoga tapes are excellent for mature people and beginners. I have had these tapes for years and highly recommend them. I also do not become bored while doing the exercises, because each time they are performed I can feel myself becoming more flexible! Lilias leads you gently through each movement. The 20 minute routine is perfect for my schedule. Lilias' voice and pace is perfect and soothing. I am purchasing the set for a younger sister who deals with chronic pain.",1110931200,8,683,4.796610169491525
7879431,3,6304944993,These tapes are for stretching and lengthing. They are not full routines but to learn modified postions and perhaps little things to do in the day.. for example shaking the kinks out of the arm...I use to watch Lilas on PBS... when she had her long braid her voice is gentle and she talks right through. For some this may be annoying but the upside of this would be that it allows for direction... meaning you will know how your body is suppose to feel. I am researching her other vidoes. I am looking for a complete class with several positions performed several times,998611200,4,569,4.480769230769231
7879432,2,6304944993,"I agree with the first reviewer - this video gets quite old, and too slow to hold the viewer's concentration. I feel I quickly outgrew Lilias's definition of Beginner.",963964800,8,167,4.793103448275862
