6097695,5,B00GOYHROI,"Absolutely silly late 60's Spanish-language, Mexican-made masked heroine flick.  A masked heroine (with no particular super-powers other than some wrestling skills) takes on a mad scientist (are there any other kind) when he decides to conquer the world by creating fish men.  His secret recipe?  Toss in a Ken or G.I. Joe doll with an orange fish, mix in some whirlpool action, and voila.  His henchmen look like, as my son put it, a bunch of guys that just finished a dominos game.  Our heroine fights crime or whatever in a bikini.  Isn't she afraid it will shift when she is throwing kicks and punches.  She also has two, count them, two boyfriends helping her save the world for Mexican republicanism.  Wait till you see the fish-man.  A worthy contender for the worst monster costume ever.  Not to be missed.  The VCI DVD is excellent quality.  The picture and color are sharp and clear.  Unfortunately no subtitles.  Worth getting for the camp value alone.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1414800000,2,999,4.794117647058823
6097696,5,B00GOYHROI,"This is one of my new favorites in cheesy Mexican luchador sci-fi movies.  Unlike most cheap DVDs, the picture was very clear for the age. I couldn't follow most of the story line since I can't understand Spanish, but I don't think that hurt the movie in any way. Batwoman was well done, a true kick-butt hero who happens to be ripped and looks great in the bikini she usually wears (while kicking butt!).",1409011200,3,405,4.472972972972973
6097697,5,B00GOYHROI,"I love this movie for many reasons. First, I was a teenager in 1968 when this Mexican produced movie was released to bank on the popularity of the original USA campy & classic tv series and movie BATMAN were made. Most of all because I LOVED (and still do)THE ULTRA SEXY ITALIAN ACTRESS Ms. MAURA MONTI and saw the movie on a big screen during a matinee - what memories this brings!! Ms. Monti became one of the most popular actresses in Mexico and to my recollection she probably starred in about 30 movies or more that were produced during Mexico's second golden era of cinema during the 1960's comedies and light dramas. Ms. Monti was simply a gorgeous, beautiful black raven-haired & talented woman. You can appreciate her beauty specially in LA MUJER MUCIELAGO since she is constantly running around & chasing bad guys, mad scientists and A MONSTER THAT LOOKS LIKE THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON IN NO LESS THAN A TWO PIECE BIKINI, GO-GO BOOTS AND A CAPE!!! How did the producers of this campy but very entertaining movie got away with the similarities of characters originated in Hollywood movies without copyright infringement is totally beneath me. What matters here is the sheer & silly but fun entertainment this movie offers. ZOOM!! KA-POW!! CRASH!! BOING!! HERE'S LA MUJER MURCIELAGO!! ENJOY!!",1397520000,7,1309,4.848214285714286
6097698,4,B00GOYHROI,"Assuming you're a Lucha Libre film fan and are already hip to the genre's formulas and budget restraints, this is a uniquely entertaining movie, the Batman and wrestling themes further enhanced by Creature From the Black Lagoon and 1960's James Bond lifts.

One thing I'd failed to notice before ordering this DVD however is that it's a Spanish language picture without any subtitle options.  That said, even if you don't speak Spanish you shouldn't have too much trouble following the plot.  Recommended.",1393027200,12,505,5.134146341463414
8625918,4,B00GOYHROI,"Although the movie was all in Spanish, you can still figure out what is going on.  And the best part, a very hot crime fighter wearing a bikini, boots. mask, gloves and cape.  What's not to like.",1485388800,,195,4.243243243243243

8625921,4,B00GOYHROI,"great fun to watch,the few words i could make out helped me to understand the plot properly,not that anyone couldn't,tho' subtitles(not the dreadful
dubbing) would have earned five stars but it's a good watch and Maura Monti  is a very competent heroineand a lot prettier than Adam West!!
a must for all caped crusader fans!!! p.s picture quality is good too.",1444089600,,359,4.885245901639344
8625922,1,B00GOYHROI,no subtitles.  It says it has english subtitles it doesn't.  False advertising.  False description.  bummer.,1443139200,4,108,6.0

8625924,3,B00GOYHROI,"Well, I was under the impression that it would come with English subtitles.  Didn't work out that way.  Fortunately, you really don't need to speak the language to follow along.  By day, Maura Monti is a professional wrestler who works in a full-body Batman suit.  And by night, she strips down to a bikini (and even by today's standards, she looks very good) and fights crime as Bat-Woman!  She tangles with some mad doctor and his numerous henchmen.  Naturally, she wins in the end and all the bad guys perish by the very sea creature the mad doc created!",1437955200,,557,4.575757575757576
