7812767,5,6301581040,"An amazing amalgam of actors in their prime and a tight, well-balanced script makes for one of the best action movies ever.  Lorenzo Lamas stars as ""Soldier:"" a head-case, former Special Forces cop who lives by his own rules.  When his world crumbles around him, Soldier retreats to the only law he knows: his own.  The action scenes are amazing, and the plot keeps you guessing from minute to minute.  Filmed in the spectacular Canadian Eastern Wilderness, ""SNAKEEATER"" or ""SNAKE-EATER"" is a wonderful romp through the underbelly of human emotion and desire.  Is there any greater commitment than love?  Also not to be missed for the sake of hearing the beautiful and haunting title theme: ""Soldier.""  ""Soldier...where's your sister...."" Another highlight is one of the Big Screen's greatest villains: The Dentist.  Truly gorgeous.  A hell of a lot better than ""Kill Bill 2.""",1085443200,5,876,5.06993006993007
