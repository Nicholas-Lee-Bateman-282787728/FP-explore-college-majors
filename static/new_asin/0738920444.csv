2877,4,0738920444,"I liked this video.  However, if ones intentions for buying it were to see/hear uncensored aspects of show (nudity/swearing)- you will be really disappointed.  It is very censored.  But if you are interested in seeing  some hysterically amusing previously unseen on tv parts of the show (What  was it really like?  What did they think of this?  What was really going  on with those two?  etc) - I think the video will be worth the price.  Basically, after watching the tape, I felt like I understood more about  what was going on and I was rolling on the floor laughing at the same time.",945648000,2,587,4.548076923076923
2878,3,0738920444,Real World is Awesome. You get up close and personal with these seven strangers. I can't wait till next season to see what MTV and Real World have in store for us viewers. Keep up the great work MTV.....,942796800,2,203,4.230769230769231
2879,5,0738920444,"This is probably one of the best MTV Real World tapes that are out.  Colin is absolutely hysterical, as well as easy on the eyes.  The only thing that is a bit misleading is the ""uncensored"" comment they make about  the tape.  Everyone still has those fuzzy bars blocking all the important  parts, and the ""bad words"" are bleeped-but, the tape is great!  Buy it!",942796800,12,362,4.492307692307692
2880,1,0738920444,"This is nothing but stuff that fell on the cutting room floor that didn't make the MTV edit. It's a waste of time and money. If you want to get close to the cast members, move to Hollywood. They're all over this place. And  they think they're real actors. Ha!",941500800,3,259,4.18
2881,1,0738920444,"What a waste. This video is completely censored. Not worth the money. Rent, don't buy.",941241600,2,86,4.8
2882,1,0738920444,"Here they are, the Insufferable Seven in all their uncensored glory. And  guess what? They're exactly the same uncensored as they are when their  a**es are blurred and their obscenities are beeped.
It is kind of funny  that these would-be exhibitionists--especially Teck, Kaia and  Ruthie--didn't sign nudity releases, and so the scenes of them cavorting  nude are still blurred out. How does Kaia expect to get a modeling contract  if she doesn't show some T? Some A? From her riveting personality? And  while on the nudity subject, it's more than a little disingenuous for Colin  to eschew the girls' nudity when he's never got a shirt covering up his  studly chest.
The only fun thing about this video is that Justin--that  pretentious, cigarette-smoking, pseudo intellectual creep--gets sent up  very effectively. The producers do have the last laugh on him. From his  phony double talk to his failure to flush before he flees, he'd no doubt be  mortified to see how he really comes across.
The video is organized  ""thematically,"" so there is a ""bloopers"" section (NOT  funny), a nudity section (censored), a bodily functions section (Teck and  Colin farting), and so on. There is no ""narrative"" to speak of,  none of the stories are forwarded the way they were episodically in the  regular season.
What would have been MUCH more interesting, if the  producers wanted to really provide something that we couldn't get watching  on TV, would have been a video showing the cast members' reactions to  having their foibles broadcast on national television. None of what we  watch on TRW is in real time, it all happened 5 months ago. I would have  loved to see Amaya's embarrassment while witnessing her own ill-fated Colin  obsessing. I'd love to see Kaia realizing she's not going to get a modeling  contract. I'd love to see Matt cringe as he watches himself ministering to  Ruthie's every alcoholic whim.
Soon, these people will (like Justin did  before them) be dropping off the national radar screen, never to be heard  from again. Rumor has it that Colin has been offered a TV pilot, and if the  cute factor alone can get him a ""showbiz"" career, more power to  him; one doubts it, though. He's old news.",941068800,,2210,4.862903225806452
2883,1,0738920444,"UNCENSORED ????? Baloney, the producers should be sued for false advertising. If you are buying to ""see what you won't see"" on MTV, forget it. If you are buying it because you just can't get enough of  the show - get a life.",940809600,4,224,4.209302325581396
2884,2,0738920444,"The box says 100%uncovered, what a big lie! I thought it would be uncensored. It's the same stuff that you would see on regular TV. Don't waste your money on this.",939772800,2,163,4.290322580645161
2885,1,0738920444,"I wonder where the producers got the idea that this was a cast that really likes each other, or that this is the most interesting cast yet.  Haven't they realize that people watch just to feel better about THEMSELVES?  Is  there anyone who DOESN'T laugh at these people?",939686400,,270,4.583333333333333

7788241,5,0738920444,"The reason I liked this video is because it showed the cast when they were silly. Colin and Teck as really funny in this video and it shows a side to the cast that we didn't get to see during the show, since all we saw was Ruthie getting trashed and everyone in the house bagging on eachother. RW New Orleans was my ultimate favorite, but this one comes in second!",1058140800,,364,4.140845070422535
7788242,1,0738920444,"There are two things that will really say what's wrong with this video. One is that it advertises that there is 100% never-before-seen footage, but EVERYTHING on the video was shown in the episodes they aired on TV (except maybe some of the confessionals and the outtakes). And the other thing is...well, I guess MTV has a different definition for ""uncensored"" than everyone else has, because everything is censored, even profanity in the dialogue. This video is false advertising. Don't buy it.",1042070400,11,495,5.048780487804878
7788243,1,0738920444,"Uncensored and Uncut? Maybe MTV has a different definition of ""Uncensored"" than the rest of the world. I offer up a new title, ""Sad and Pathetic.""
Boring and near unwatchable. I, too, wish I could receive some kind of refund after purchasing this tape. Completely misrepresented, and not entertaining please heed my warning and don't reward them for slapping together such a pointless and mislabelled compilation.",1039737600,6,413,5.2727272727272725
7788244,2,0738920444,"I don't know what MTV thinks ""uncensored"" means, but it sure isn't what my dictionary says!  There are some funny and interesting behind the scenes spots, but the annoying BLEEPS over any nasty words and the  mosaic over any nudity far outweighs anything positive about this tape. If  anything, the footage teases with new footage but never comes through. I  wasn't expecting any porn shots, but figured I'd see or hear something  ""uncensored"".  STAY AWAY!",948672000,36,456,5.013333333333334
7788245,1,0738920444,"I concur with my fellow reviewers.  This cover leads you on and lets you believe you'll be seeing uncensored picture of some of the Real World stars.  Not so!  All of the ""erogenous zones"" are blurred out and  all the swearing is censored as well.  So much for ""Totally  Uncensored""!",948153600,20,283,4.56
7788246,1,0738920444,"Totally false advertizing. They say '100% uncensored' which is complete B.S., all the private parts and swearing have been blocked out.",947116800,30,135,5.476190476190476
7788247,1,0738920444,"This video is not worth buying. MTV misled me and many other buyers by advertising ""100% uncovered, unedited, etc."" That advertising is what got me to buy the video in the first place, but basically it is a bad  version of the show, edited speech and blurred nudity. If you are looking  to see something you didn't see on the TV show, this isn't the video you  want. In my opinion, don't buy this video.",945993600,,403,4.346666666666667
7788248,4,0738920444,"I thought the video was really good.  The subject matter was a little more adult than the TV show but I did not think they would censor it like they did.  I wasn't expecting to see nudity but I didn't think they'd beep out  the swearing.  Also, it's only 50 minutes, they could have filled it up  with more bloopers.",945820800,3,316,4.2
7788249,4,0738920444,"In Short: Worth it for the commentary from former ""Real Worlder"" Puck.
Real World has been one of the most popular shows on MTV, and although I was a fan of the first couple of casts, some of the casts  afterwards argued with each other to the point of annoying. ""Road  Rules"" proved to be more interesting as it took the ""Real  World"" concept on the road, but still, the casts got a little  annoying.
I did begin to watch the most recent ""Real World"",  which provided a few fun moments and a cast that wasn't arguing 99% of the  time. Since I started watching late in the episodes, I was kinda interested  in this little documentary that takes a look at what you ""didn't  see"" on the show. The cast members discuss what went on and then we  see a lot of the edited footage - unfortunately, the edited footage is  edited. The nudity is ""blurred"" and the cursing is bleeped. The  footage itself is slightly entertaining, but the documentary isn't the best  thing about this DVD. I'll talk about the most hilarious part of this disc  later in this review.
The picture quality is good, nothing special. It's  just what you'd expect from a TV- type show. Same with the sound, clear and  no problems. What's really the very best part of this DVD is the special  features. For those who remember a couple of ""real world""'s back,  you'll remember the character who got kicked out of the house, Puck and how  insane he was. Puck contributes the audio commentary for this documentary  and it's nothing short of hilarious. It's an ""R-rated"" commentary  that's insanely funny, ripping into the series and making fun of what the  characters are doing on-screen. I laughed loudly quite a few times during  the commentary, it's just insanely funny. If you didn't see the ""Real  World"" that Puck starred in, imagine if Beavis from ""Beavis and  Butthead"" was doing a commentary for this documentary. Definitely one  of the most hilarious commentaries I've heard in a while.
There's also  little cast bios and the ability to watch a little clip of the audition  tapes for each of the cast members and a little photo gallery. All in all  the documentary was a bit lame, but the Puck commentary alone earns this  disc a.. Grade:B- All in all, maybe a rental if you're a fan of the show.",945820800,4,2267,4.555831265508685
