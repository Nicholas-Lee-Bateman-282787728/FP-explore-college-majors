8559113,5,B00AY7B7EM,"Absolutely incredible! The creators ""knocked it out the park"" with Star Blazers 2199. Star Blazers 2199 covers the gaps, answer questions, and eliminates wasteful episodes (Balanosaurus/Magnetron Wave) from the original series. I didn't think it was possible, but Desslok is even more ruthless than before and Lysis, long thought to be a fanatic,is portrayed in a different light.  A MUST buy for all Star Blazer fans.",1467936000,2,418,5.333333333333333

8559117,5,B00AY7B7EM,"Yamato was the defining anime that got me into the genre way back in the late 70's early 80's. This Space Opera paved the way for Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica. When I heard they were rebooting the series and starting fresh, I was excited yet concerned that Yamato would get the bland, uninteresting anime treatment and ended up absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the fantastic art, inspiring and exciting soundtrack and the character development that was sorely missed by the bowdlerized American version we got ""Star Blazers"".

This anime is and should be an example of remakes done right, with slight deviations from the original story and the removal of a lot of the 1970's kitsch that makes me chuckle now when I rewatch the older series.

The only downside, which I actually enjoyed contrary to Yamato Die Hards chagrin, is the addition of more female crew members..however this takes a lot of weight off of Yuki Mora, the character, and gives her more growth in the long run. They are however, moe-blobs which might put some purists off.

You cannot go wrong buying this series, however I am waiting for a ""Complete"" Blu-Ray collection and the movies.",1398211200,2,1153,4.813131313131313
8559118,5,B00AY7B7EM,"I grew up watching this cartoon in the 70's.  I even got my kids to watch the original version.  Found out about this and WOW!  They did a great job all the way from the animation, music, new characters, plot.

If your a Starblazers buff you will not be disappointed.

I only hope that when Voyager entertainment comes out with the Starblazers 2199 they use the original voices.",1384300800,6,378,4.5
8559119,5,B00AY7B7EM,"this is by far the best one yet

I gave it five stars because it just that good

I can't wait for volume 6

I highly recommend this to add to any yamato collection",1372377600,4,163,3.735294117647059
8559120,5,B00AY7B7EM,"Got this delivered to my house at noon today and popped it immediately into my blu-ray player.  Right from opening scene I was on the edge of my seat as this video gripped my attention beginning with the possible assassination of Lord Desslock and the one accused being brought on trial in a manner that remind me of Krypton criminals trial at the start of Christopher Reeve Superman Motion Picture.  The Gameilons rounding up rebels in their camps aren't the only ones dealing with traitors.  With the captain sick Nimi and the head security officer plots a mutiny aboard the Yamato and try to take over the ship. Kodai and Yuri grows closer together in this DVD and we visit some familiar locations that were visited in 1970s series. Sandra and Nimi gives the viewers memory flashbacks from before the war giving some hints on Yuri's  and Kodai's brother's past.

Like other DVDs in Japanese with English subtitles. If your player like mine you probably have to turn on subtitle option as the subtitles don't start up on it own like the episodes themselves do.  It has a nice wrap around image of the Yamato slip cover over the blu-ray case and come with a booklet to talk about episodes, characters and mechanic of the ships. This volume I can really see how new series work well in theaters with episodes put together in movie format.

The fact Vol 3 alone cost me $80 and Vol 4 and vol 5 together cost me $100 would say one save buying in bulk from Japan.",1369785600,2,1460,4.52851711026616
