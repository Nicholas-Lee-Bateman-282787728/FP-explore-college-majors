8293302,4,B001DHXT3E,"A GOLD DIGGER.. male ego...This is so typical of men who want something they really don't need or can't have unless they have plenty of money, then you got yourself a 'gold digger'.  But the problem is the boyfriend thinks that she really likes/love him, and is spendng all his money, but she only likes what he has...money...a DOT.COM CORPORATION...that HIT'S BOTTOM.  See how fast she sticks around for him now.

HE'S BROKE, SHE'S GONE.  Well you'd think that would be  enough for him to see that this is a 'gold digger', but men are so stupid.  A pretty woman (or she thinks so) for a not so attractive, plain man with money.

Now that he's broke and she's gone, he want to work to get her back.  Men's ego is pityful. It has never crossed his mind that she left him and it was all for his money. That was the lesson that he was suppose to learn, but did he learn it, HECK NO. He's going to win her back. That's so pityful and is typical for most men who live like this.
They don't understand 'gold diggers'and being 'UNEVENLY YOKED', GOD LESSON TO ALL OF US.

5 days later, she has a new boyfriend, a new BB player waiting to sign millions contract and he is a boy to her, but she's spending money he has not even gotten. He hurts himself, no Pro contract, she's gone again. This gets to be a 'head shaking movie', he's so stupid.

He meets a good woman, beautiful who likes him for himself, no money, and they begin a relationship. He comes back into some money and old girlfriend is back and came to the game where he was with the new real GF. He leaves with the gold digger...and you'd have to see the rest..it's much more...I left out.

But you get the picture. The ending is worth it all. A MUST SEE. BUY THIS ONE.",1316563200,,1723,4.238532110091743
