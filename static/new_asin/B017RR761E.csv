Some actors sometimes say their lines quite well, but later some actors will be so bad it kicks you out of being engaged with the drama.

7514801,4,B017RR761E,"A low-key sci-fi drama, a throwback to COCOON or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (without, of course, the budget of a Spielberg or a Ron Howard film). This Australian made, American set film nonetheless presents an engaging story set against the backdrop of an impending nuclear war. The performances are mostly strong and visual effects are used well, albeit sparingly, plus there's a moment or two of limb-growing body-horror. The sci-fi element is ambiguous (what exactly is the macguffin, who sent it, etc?) and it's worth tempering your expectation for sci-fi spectacle - this is a slow burn film - though it builds to a killer climax.",1453680000,14,625,5.019230769230769

7514803,4,B017RR761E,"Terminus is among that rare breed of low-budget sci-fi production in which mediocrity is surpassed. Tough to not spoil it by reviewing it, but here goes:

It's the near future and humanity is doing what it does best: destroying life on Earth. The US is at war in the Middle East... yeah, not fiction, right? Except now it's with Iran; Russia and China aren't happy about this, but neither are many Americans, esp. since the draft has been reinstituted. Folks stateside are having trouble putting food on the table, and things have gotten so bad that even country boys and young war vets don't get along. The story follows David Chamberlain, a mechanic whose prospects are dimming by the day. And since this is science fiction, he has an ambiguously-aged cute daughter named Annabelle.

Extraterrestrials in Terminus? Yes: but while they are central to the plot, don't expect the type of ET you see in the multiplex.

Actors. Jai Koutrae fits as David Chamberlain, and Todd Lasance (in Vampire Diaries this year) as his counterpart protagonist. Kendra Appleton (aged 20-21) plays the aforementioned Annabelle, and she does it well.

Plot. The US govt is aware of the extraterrestrials and seeking them out for advantage in the war. The story is leisurely-paced; if you need action, look elsewhere. I'd almost say it's a character-driven tale. The ending is *not* anticlimactic.

Final thoughts: It always makes my day when I find a low-budget sci-fi flick that wasn't a waste of my time. This one is a workable mix of politics, interpersonal connections, and the old sci-fi standby of extraterrestrials (with a pinch of philosophy thrown in). And depending on who is elected President this year, the war with Iran may not remain fiction...",1453507200,34,1738,4.958762886597938

This isn't a big budget flick and the acting is pretty lame.  Heck, even the news announcer on the television sounded like it was someone's brother who was handed a script with the instructions of, ""Read this out loud"".

7514997,3,B017RR761E,"Starting out dark, depresses, and slow, we find David Chamberlain (Jai Koutrae) a tad upset with his economic situation and the loss of his wife.

Meanwhile back in the war room Agent Stipe (Bren Foster) is looking for help from space the bad guys who are soon to use nuclear weapons.

As unlikely as it seems these two characters and their stories will soon cross.

Caught in the crosshairs between the two stories is Annabelle Chamberlin (Kendra Appleton) the skeptical daughter who may turn out to be a major player in the story.

    

The story takes place in the US. However it was filmed in Australia so you might find a few visual faux pass; however they will not distract from the acting or the story.

The bulk of the story drags on and on until theres a time for the gratuitous shoot-em-up and chasing scenes. This gives you plenty of time to guess the outcome of the story.",1462060800,2,885,4.50314465408805

I wouldn't normally say this minor plot details are spoilers but there isn't much to this movie so I guess they are. Terminus is a bit of social commentary on war veterans not treated properly when they get injured and return to the US that you find in a lot of war films, this film is set in the future where a war with the middle east has reached such heights that conscription is back! Something crashes to earth which some white trash depressed type character crashes his car near. Of course his injuries quickly heal up as does a kidney that most of was donated to unsuccessfully try and save his wife. His college aged daughter just so the movie can have a good looking girl in this otherwise bleak looking characters film, has popped in to visit just before his car crash, so remains on scene while he toys with this weird glowing thing he found in the woods at the crash site, which has transformed an angry at the world amputee veterans life who helped haul it in as well.

Of course the US government wants this glowing thing for themselves, imagine how this will help them in the war? Will they get it though? The description I've said probably makes Terminus seem more exciting than it actually is.

7515095,2,B017RR761E,"This is a movie that missed an opportunity to be great. Without giving away too many spoilers you have your ubiquitous rogue government agents chasing after a mysterious object that crashed with a meteor, and unsurprisingly they are in pursuit at all costs.  You have a rural family trying to stay afloat financially and do the best they can in life until they get swept up in a mysterious chain of events.  Naturally Dad is a self destructive wreck because his wife died and at best he has a tenuous relationship with his college aged daughter.  In the background you see TV reports of a war in Iran getting ready to boil over. Military casualties are high while bringing the world closer to the brink of nuclear war.  Mix these slow moving and sometimes ambiguous plot elements together and you get a B rated film that you wonder why you watched.  Bottom line is the potential of this film is wasted and once you get to the ending you have more questions than you started with. You conclude you watched another cliche Sci-Fi film that could have been so good.

This is a movie you watch late at night when you are too lazy to get up and go to bed.  You endure the film's plot hoping it will get better and become so much more than it is.  You finish the movie disappointed.  It's 3 AM and you regret staying up so late.  Don't spend the money.

8740297,2,B017RR761E,"In the world of science fiction, a ridiculous plot is a bold and risky move. Audiences will generally see it in one of two ways, either as unique and innovative or ridiculous and stupid. While I general advise deciding for yourself, in the case of Terminus, I think the answer is pretty clear. David Chamberlain (Jai Koutrae) is a depressed alcoholic who lives with his daughter. One night he's driving home drunk and is involved in a wreck that should have killed him, except for the fact that he encounters a rock from outer space, that not only heals him, but starts giving him visions. Chamberlain starts seeing visions of the end of the world and sets out on a mission to build something remarkable, in the back of a stolen cement truck. The whole premise here is kind of stupid, however if the casting was better this actually could have worked. The main character here is a guy in his late forties, a factory worker with no skills, no education and general someone everyone already thinks is crazy. In my opinion he just doesn't fit what the story calls for. This would have been a much better film if the main character was a late teen or twenty something guy, who saw the incident as his life being spared for a higher purpose. Instead, Terminus is just really one big mess of sub-par acting, plot holes, and badly developed characters you really don't care about. If you don't care about the characters and what happens to them, and if you can't follow the story too well, then really, what's the point?",1490486400,,1513,4.5661764705882355
