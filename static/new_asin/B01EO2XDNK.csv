8759292,5,B01EO2XDNK,"What a delightful movie,  along with the other Cities of Love films, these are just great.  They don't insult the audience by giving them all the details, just vignettes of love and mucho local color, so one gets to see the city in all its aspects.
Very clever...",1492387200,,263,4.458333333333333

8759295,1,B01EO2XDNK,"Loved ""Paris, Je t'aime"", and ""New York, I love you"".  Really looked forward to this because my wife and I also love Rio, a fabulous and vibrant city, full of amazing people and culture.

This movie was a VERY sad disappointment for both my wife and for me. A total waste of time and money. Do not waste yours on this.",1473120000,,318,4.19672131147541

8759298,5,B01EO2XDNK,"Always a pleasure to watch an A-list cast work on a film which is aimed at depicting life as it really is, rather than flowery romanticism. A little scary to watch Basil Hoffman in the beginning of the film - he can play such a CONVINCING corpse!

There's a lot going on in Rio and a lot to love in this excellent movie!",1467504000,,320,4.079365079365079
