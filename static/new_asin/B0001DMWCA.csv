8010886,3,B0001DMWCA,"While I found the DVD on Georgia's Sanford Stadium to be very informative, I was left a little disapointed with the overall product. It gave a very good history lesson on the stadium itself, hence the title. But I was hoping for something more along the lines of memories of the greatest games ever played between the hedges. I'd hoped to hear Larry Munson give his classic renditions of Sanford games of past. That didn't happen. I would say unless you're a devout fan of UGA and the school's rich history, you may pass on this one.",1341273600,,533,4.505154639175258
