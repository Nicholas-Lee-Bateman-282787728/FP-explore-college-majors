8248591,5,B0012ZQ308,"The film covers an indefinite period in summer in Provence:  several days, several weeks - one can't be sure.  There are some elements that recall ""la nouvelle vague"" in cinema and literature, in this case the intermingling of past and present, one or similar events seen multiple times, sometimes from slightly different angles, sometimes from different characters' viewpoints (physically and emotionally).  Its structure is definitely not linear and the viewer has to be able to hold all the visual and verbal elements and allow them to build up the story in a more circuitous and multi-layered way.  There are richly human moments, though not all are happy ones - which is, after all, part of what makes for human moments.  The story revolves around the friendship of the two men, and its effects on them and those around them - as the brief resume tells us.  The story is also unresolved - no tidy ending, again like life - though there is a hint of what is to come.

The cinematography is often ravishing.  The two homes and the surrounding countryside and near-by village are almost characters in their own right.  Painfully beautiful sometimes.

The film is well worth your time, even if you have to work a bit to get into its non-linear way of telling its story.  Ultimately, it style is as rewarding as a more direct narrative, possibly even more so.

Despite its melancholy elements, it remains life-affirming - though it is an affirmation that encompasses pain as well as joy.  I was very impressed and moved.

It's available at Netflix, so you have a chance to watch it there since it isn't currently available to buy.",1304812800,,1630,4.775
8248592,3,B0012ZQ308,"This is a intricate film, layering the events of one night and one deep conversation into almost two hours of the film. Two men - a straight married man vacationing with his family and his gay neighborgh - sit down for a friendly chat about commitment and nature of love and wind up turning each other's life upside down. The strength of the film is in its unusual camera work and angles that intensify and prolong the story. The weaknesses are that the coherency is lost in all the glitz. The best part of the film is a sequence about a bride and groom and each man describing what he thinks the newly married couple feels. If only the rest of the film could've carried that spirit and heartfelt dialogue, this would've been an amazing motion picture.",1243209600,,752,4.4963503649635035
