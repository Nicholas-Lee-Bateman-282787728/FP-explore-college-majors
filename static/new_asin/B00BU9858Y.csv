5673729,3,B00BU9858Y,"In central Sahara a rig is drilling down to a cavern discovered 9 miles below the surface. When contact is lost, Jack, a lone security guard (Adrian Paul) is sent to investigate. He finds the place abandoned, ransacked, and clearly the former occupants believed they were under attack by a demon.

After spending the night, Jack discovers a lone survivor, Dr. Jenny Christianson a lovely blonde who whats to leave. As Jack is ordered to wait until help arrives, he hallucinates and comes to believe in the same demons. The question posed to the audience asks what is real and what is not real.

There were not many people in this low action tale. The hallucinations were done effectively. The wind, sights, and sounds played well upon the imagination. Even the names were carefully selected. Perhaps one of the better recycled films. I thought it was worth the cheap rental price.

5673752,4,B00BU9858Y,"I liked this movie, dang it!

A lot of those who reviewed  it before me apparently didn't... Which is fine,  really.

If you DON'T like a movie or a book or a play or whatever it may be...if it just isn't your ""cup of tea"" then you are howlingly right to say so.

But it has always seemed to me that if one is going to criticize a work of art it is only fair to do so on its own terms. Now this movie stars Adrian Paul. Some there are  who aren't impressed with his acting. Personally I LOVE the guy and always have yet nothing impressed me more than when---at the height of his fame (HIGHLANDER and all that, you know) he went  back to his theatrical roots (even while television and movie offers were pouring in) in order to hone his craft.

And it shows here...he gives a more nuanced performance here. He reaches into hitherto unexplored areas of his ""human ness to show us a vulnerability we had not seen before.

As for the story... It manages to provide enough eeriness and suspense to hold the interest.

Altogether a worthy addition to any collection.",1482883200,4,1060,4.308080808080808

Cinematography was great, as was the production values for this direct-to-video psychological thriller/horror. Acting fit the story well, and the plot keeps itself fresh, inventive, and interesting. The first ten minutes or so are dreadfully slow, but sometimes that's not a bad thing, as the slow build-up, the creating of an atmosphere, really worked here. A couple scares, only an unintentional goofy moment or two, and a series of plot-twists that actually fit together. Also, butts. Both male and female, and not too much of either.

Yes, the movie is a little slow.  Yes, some plot issues don't make sense.  Yes, disbelief must be suspended == but you should expect that with any horror / thriller.

Basically, the movie operates around two possible themes -- the scientist drilling in the desert have unleashed a terrible evil.  Alternately, they have pierced an isolated biosphere and those in proximity experience hallucinations where memory, fears, and dreams become one.  This makes for some rather interesting work for the female lead (sexy leggy blonde scientist...or devil...or is she even real...) as she alternates from the empathetic love interest to the murderous spawn of the abyss.

5674003,2,B00BU9858Y,"This was, first off, not a terrible movie.  The cinematography was pretty good, the mine had some genuine atmosphere, the effects (while corny) weren't terrible, the plot had definite possibilities, the acting was pretty when it wasn't weighed down by campy writing.  It's just that this movie itself felt like it had no idea what it wanted to be; like they started off with one script writer who wanted to make a B Horror movie about a mining crew finding hell, then midway through switched to another writer who wanted to go for more of a pretentious and mildly preachy psychological thriller.

Let's talk about the B-Movie side of 9 Miles Down first.  Throughout the film you will encounter numerous familiar horror movie tropes  like the walls that squirt blood or the spoooooky old witch lady.  If you've never seen a horror movie before, you may be frightened.  If not, you will find them about as disturbing as a Charlie Brown sheet ghost rattling plastic chains and making woo-woo noises.  These could be written off as build-up.  If they'd stepped up their game, pumped the originality in the third act and, say, taken us, I dunno, nine miles down to Hell as the title and cover of this movie would suggest, there would have been some pay-off.  Instead we end up with a climax that makes the Burger King seem disturbing in comparison.

Because, you see, this movie is really not a horror film.  It's a psychological thriller that's really more of a philosophical debate between Thomas Jackman, a security guard who believes (albeit nominally) in the supernatural, and Doctor Christianson, who believes that everything has a logical explanation... even the screams and demonic presences that seem to be emanating from a shaft her crew dug nine miles into the earth's crust.  Sadly, this turned into a lot of squandered potential.

Why?  Because the director tries to sell the supernatural side of the plot with the same conviction most Disney puts into convincing us the villain is really just trying to help the princess out by giving her that apple.  Every time something spooky happens, someone immediately shows up to debunk it.  There is an entire subplot concerning Christianson possibly being the devil that is debunked with such regularity that when Jackman continues to believe it we think he's a moron and a psychopath.  Any feeling of suspense or build-up is immediately squashed, which makes this not so much of a debate or discussion, but a straw-man argument against the possibility of ghosts or hell or any of the supernatural crap they're trying to sell us on the cover.

When it comes down to it, this film was, at best, pretentious, stupid, and mildly silly, and at worst a slap in the face to whomever they were aiming this nonsense at.",1389484800,,2763,4.828025477707007

Don't see that many differing of opinions for too many films. I was apprehensive at first about watching this, but I am glad I did. Was raised watching movies growing up, so have seen hundreds if not a thousand, and can make pretty good judgment calls on quality VS quantity. Have seen my share of films in which sadly those 2 hours spent, I will never get back; and this was not, in my opinion, one of them. This movie, as another has mentioned in their review, is made very well in that there are not many characters actually involved in the main plot; but the main leading male was quite effective in pulling his part through to make this a film worth watching. I like that throughout the movie, especially towards the ending 40 minutes, it was difficult to determine whether he was having difficulty discerning reality from fantasy or if the events being seen were actual events, not just his enhanced perceptions. For what I would call a ""B-movie"", was well put together, and enjoyed the psychological aspects being so strong throughout. I would give it a 3.5 to a 4.0-star, depending on viewing as a horror film or psychological thriller. I would watch it again  ;)",1375228800,,1297,4.663755458515284

Pretty soon he cannot tell the truth from the lies much less reality from delusion. The movie keeps you guessing and becomes intense during the last 30 minutes of the movies. It is certainly worth watching if only for the mystery and discovering what is really going on.

Though some would have you believe that the final act is obvious, there are enough twists and turns in the movie to keep you swaying from the rational to supernatural explanations till the end.

Some pretty location shots, eerie hallways and blood splattered rooms for atmosphere give it a pretty convincing feel.  The movie keeps the viewer on his toes throughout the film with just enough scares to keep you interested in the story.

Curiously, this movie makes me want to watch the two versions of the The Exorcist prequel, Exorcist: The Beginning and  Dominion: A Prequel to the Exorcist, a couple of movies that are a good example of the same story with two different viewpoints.

Second, this movie automatically gets a few points just for not being about another bunch of teenagers whose party weekend goes awry.
I like the basic premise of this movie... even if it is one of those dream narratives that gives an excuse to throw all sorts of bizarre visuals at the camera without rhyme or reason. When they're done right (Jacob's Ladder) they can be great... but if there is no other point (The Cell) then it's just a bunch of random junk.
Thankfully this movie pulls out of that nosedive in its last third and gives you a bit of tangible reality to hold on to.
The beginning of the movie is the scariest bit... it really sets up expectations for something far worse than what you get. That dead jackal and the blood Arabic promise monsters that never show up... and frankly they'd probably be way beyond the budget of this movie.
The lead actress is probably the best FX of the film. There's something weird about her looks... and she really doesn't look like she belongs on a geological research team in the midst of the Sahara. Her strange looks keep you guessing.

Adrian Paul does a good job playing his role as an armed security man sent to a research facility in the Sahara in order to investigate the disappearance of a research team. When he arrives there is a woman, only a woman, everybody else is gone. Evidence starts to mount that the woman is not who she says she is and after hearing some recordings from the underground site, he begins to believe that something very sinister is going on and that the woman is behind it. He keeps coming up with reasons not to trust her, but she is able to bring him back with reason. Eventually he goes stark raving mad. Did this team happen to drill a hole into Hell itself? He begins to believe it. Mired by his own personal demons, he slips further over the edge. Even after returning to civilization he can't keep it together. Guilt over the death of his wife and kids has done a number on this poor guy and the mystery of the research site has driven him mad. Nicely done by Adrian Paul. I do like him a lot. He has this quality to look like a hero one minute and then look like a wounded puppy the next. He is able to shed his rugged good looks and tough guy persona by playing the victim or being wounded.

There are only 2 prominent characters so the story draws things out to make it a full length movie. I couldn't manage to care either character.

Watching 9 MILES DOWN for its cover and synopsis, you may wind up a little disappointed. Still, the acting is good and the cinematography sophisticated, with a few nice twists and surprises. There is also some interesting play on the ""Hell is in your head"" theme.

Much of the first half is just blabbing between Security Officer Thomas Jackman (Adrian Paul) and Dr. Jennie ""J.C."" Christianson (get it?--played by Kate Nauta), who are the only characters we see on a regular basis. Nevertheless, some of the blabbing's quite meaningful and interesting. As 9 MILES DOWN progresses, we get a lot of standard horror flick hallucinations and nightmares, confusion and vagary, blood and zombie imagery. There are some other, fairly unexpected complications that I won't give away. This film also shows a lot of booty (both hers and his).

Probably worth seeing if you're a big supernatural/psychological horror fan--Just don't expect it to make too much sense.

8573887,5,B00BU9858Y,"9 Miles Down is not about flacking like I thought by looking at the box art, lol.  I was wrong there!  9 Miles down is actually an *awesome* horror movie!

It's about a security expert (played by Adrian Paul) who's sent to investigates a research team.  They suddenly disappeared and he's the one who checks around the research facilities somewhere in the Sahara desert.  The description for the movie mentions a long hole that the drilling team dug into that might lead to hell, but the story only hints at a possible evil presence such as Adrian listening to audio samples on a computer and hearing growling when turned up at a high enough volume.  Otherwise there's a scene where Adrian's next to the hole, drops his flashlight in, and is informed that the drop to the bottom takes 5 minutes.  We're even teased with blood on the side of the long tunnel as the camera shows the flashlight falling down.  We soon learn the ""hell"" comes in the way of psychological horror.

You see Adrian Paul's character shares a horrible story later on.  He was at a birthday party for his child.  He was a cop then, and suddenly got a call that he had to leave.  He lives with a lot of regret that he had to leave that day because soon after his wife (Meredith Ostrom) shot not only herself, but apparently the kids as well.  Why?  Who knows.  Maybe she was depressed or angry with her suspicions that Adrian was cheating on her.  The movie hints at the latter.  He's been living with tremendous guilt and psychological problems ever since.  The movie does a fantastic job teasing these mental issues though and making it look like everyone's out to get him.  Actually by ""everyone"" I mean one person!

When Adrian first arrives to the desert, well the atmosphere is pretty good.  We see sand blowing around the research buildings and he appears to be all alone.  Adrian does some investigating... until soon after he uses his binoculars and sees something in the desert.  It's a woman jogging, and running towards the facility.  What's she doing way out here?  It's too hot to go for a morning jog!  It's weird when Adrian's looking through the binoculars the woman isn't there at all, and suddenly she forms.  This is a teaser that the woman might not be real.

Af first Adrian is confused much like we all are.  Adrian questions the woman (played by Kate Nauta by the way) and asks what she's doing here.  The movie does a tremendous job at this early point not revealing Adrian's mental issues, so we perceive the woman as a possible ghost.  At least I did!  The two get to know each other better.  They discuss the hole outside, and this is actually the only time we see the hole in the whole movie but it's not necessarily disappointing.  The storyline actually tricked me pretty good!  I went in expecting demons and ghosts haunting a research facility but instead got mental torment concerning Adrian's guilt over his wife's suicide.

Anyway Adrian sees crows flying in a circle out in the desert.  This scene scared me for some reason.  I've never seen crows fly like that before.  We later find out there's dead bodies there.  Or at least, Adrian's hallucination makes it seem so!  Kate and Adrian discuss all kinds of topics.  Adrian mention that love can be broken down into a chemical compound.  Kate responds even the greatest notes in the world can be written down on paper but she can still be moved by it.  That's... quite the well-prepared answer!  If she said that to me I'd think ""You got me there!""  lol.

After this Adrian starts having bad dreams... or so it seems, that he's roaming around the research building late at night seeing his wife.  She points a gun at her head and kills herself.  Another dream involves their son sitting up out of his bloody bed and pointing at Adrian making it look like Adrian's to blame for their deaths.  It's quite freaky.  At this point in the story, look out!  The confusion might escalate for you!  It's okay if you just remember Adrian's wife and the suicide ties into everything, and that mental torment has taking hold of Adrian (but not Kate).

Now the fact Kate isn't experiencing any of this torment raises some flags.  How can that be?  Especially once we get to the explanation behind these hallucinations at the end.  It's a well-said explanation that ties up the story pretty well, but it doesn't make sense that Kate would somehow be spared of these hallucinations.  I spoil the ending in my final paragraph- you've been warned.  Kate does try her best to explain she's really part of the research team, and has pictures and names to prove it.  But does this satisfy Adrian who can't believe anything she says?  Nope!  The guy just can't be satisfied!  He believes Kate is a demon liar I guess.  It doesn't help that Kate often gives off a look like she's about to turn on Adrian and hopes he doesn't find out her true intentions.

Anyway the main chunk of the story is that Adrian tries to sort through his mental issues but he insists VERY strongly that Kate is trying to kill him.  That she's the devil in disguise.  Things get worse when Adrian's taking a shower, Kate walks up behind him, he flips out and smacks her repeatedly with the curtain rod.  From here the chase is on.  One second we see Kate running away scared (only to disappear when Adrian comes back).  The next it appears Kate's secretly trying to kill Adrian and take his soul.  It's fun stuff!  Confusing? Yeah that too!  Adrian shoots at Kate from a window while listening to a tape of a researcher trying to convince anyone who's listening that Kate's no good, even though Kate thinks he's completely crazy.

Oh but I have to mention this scene!  It's when Adrian's in a bathroom.  He sees a demonic version of himself in the mirror.  This demonic figure tells Adrian to point a gun at himself, and it laughs when he does.  We then see a row of Adrian's in the mirror, and when he turns around and looks at the mirror behind him he notices that there's evil Adrian's mixed with the good, and each one is killing himself until we get to the front of the row.  Adrian drops down scared.  What a scene.

The REALLY confusing scene is when Adrian sees Kate dressed in a red apron and cooking dinner for him (raw meat, ew!) and portraying herself as Adrian's wife.  Is Kate responsible for Adrian's wife's suicide?  Maybe.  Is Adrian having another of his hallucinations?  A bigger maybe!  So many ways to interpret what's going on here.  The confusion is forgivable since we're at least grounded in knowing the wife ties into everything like I say above, but by this point it really feels like Kate is a soul taker the way she makes Adrian recite a line 6 times.

The magic of this storyline is that despite all the dreams and hallucinations we're not only NOT lost because everything ties into Adrian's wife suicide, but there's also a rational explanation at the very end.  Then again maybe the answer *itself* is a hallucination, lol!  Ahhh!!  *runs away scared*.  I had to laugh when Kate's first introduced, and Adrian's communicating on the phone with a woman he works with.  When Adrian describes the person and says ""she"" in reference to Kate, the woman on the phone instantly thinks the two are madly in love!  She sounded like a little kid making fun of a boy for being with a girl.  Silly.

SPOILER- I like when Adrian's discussing the events with a fellow worker and he says something like ""Why throw away all rationality for 1% of doubt?""  I like that answer!  Never thought about it that way.  Turns out an odorless gas was affecting Adrian's brain function.  He couldn't discern memory from reality or imaginative thoughts.  REALLY happy we get an answer to all this madness!  Even after this explanation Adrian visits Kate in the hospital and still isn't satisfied an odorless gas was responsible for his hallucinations, and this results in more madness and attempts to kill Kate!  Just leave it alone Adrian!",1497225600,,7956,4.582089552238806
