5168428,5,B008KL4TJE,"As with all of Dr. Yang's videos within his YMAA Publication Center, he creates a foundation of balanced opposites, and then proceeds to inspect the various details generating this balance of the human essence (body, mind and spirit) through martial movements and conditioning.  Volume Two of Kung Fu Body Conditioning achieves this very delicate balance through engaging very traditional training methodologies.

This single disc set is organized in a detailed flow of lecture, integrated with Dr. Yang and fellow students, demonstrating key physical principles of traditional martial conditioning.  Dr. Yang begins this instructionally enriched DVD with explaining basic qigong.  Learning to better control one's breathing, posture and internal energy flow translates into stronger internal and external sustained platforms of operations.  It is important to learn how to open one's naturally occurring energy `gates' existing in the body, if one desires to gain and generate more power and fluidity in all external expressions of martial movements.

Once the foundation is made pertaining to breath-control, opening energy gates within the system for both internal and external disciplines, the physical drills and exercises follow.

The first set of drills and exercises address upper body conditioning, and here we see drills using candle flames to focus punching power, and progressive arm movement using wooden staff and long metal bars in swinging applications for developing both coordination and strength-endurance so important with extended hand-held cold-weapons work.  There are drills hitting the heavy bag, in this segment, as well, and with a twist, there are multiple, free-swinging heavy bags one strikes as if dealing with multiple adversaries.

The second set of drills and exercises address leg strength, endurance and coordination through balance drills on vertically stacked bricks, vertical and horizontal jumping drills, along with numerous kicking exercises and extensive stance work.

There are numerous partner drills presented, focusing on developing sensitivity to adversarial movements and reaction speed sensitivities, such that, we are able to respond more quickly and more correctly to the typical adversarial cues we might receive for real.  Also, in the partner drills, the issue of developing sensitivity to distancing, to and from our opponent, is stressed so that we can eventually develop an intuitive level of correctly assessing distances between the self and others.  Included, are the traditional arm conditioning drills made famous within the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, here, too, which obviously, own their origin to traditional Chinese martial arts conditioning.

The part I enjoyed the most within this DVD offering, is the segment addressing outdoor training paradigms.  The outdoor ""gym"" Dr. Yang has created at this Northern California Retreat Center is simple but, dare I say: harsh.  It is absolutely challenging, and offers a natural way to develop martial kinematics in a fashion that is specific to the need to move in a combative environment.

There are numerous pillars buried into the ground that look essentially like tree logs covered in heavy padding and black duct tape for punching and kicking.  Again, this set up, like the free-hanging heavy bags, offers a type of multiple adversarial attacking practice and sensitivity.  In this outdoor training there are the typical vertical high chinning bars and parallel bars for upper body work.  There are grip-strength drills flipping rectangular cinder blocks; work done wear weighted vest and runs with rock filled backpacks.  Yes, militarily harsh, and I love it.

In addition to the above workouts outside, there are agility drills where students run along long piles of randomly stack logs.  It reminded me of logs dumped in a papermill about to be processed, and how the logs are just dumped all about.  Running along log piles provides one the opportunity to stress and generate great agility and balance or else fall into a heap of hard logs--ouch.  Also, students engage in a type of parcour running around the main house, jumping about, and running along waist high wooden fences and tree boughs.  Fitting, it is called ""monkey running"" in the video, and is definitely a unique anaerobic/aerobic mix of working.

The one training tool present in this video, that, to me, seemed out of place, at least for a traditional approach in training students, was the use of a modern day trampoline.  While this can be fun and develop unique gymnastic abilities, it just seemed rather an odd addition, and misplaced.

In the concluding remarks, Dr. Yang discussed the importance of preserving truly traditional training methods along with the importance of achieving a deeper spiritual connection with the development of all martial movements, as was once originally fostered in the Ancient and Old Chinese Martial Disciplines, and how today's over commercialization of such traditional approaches of practice and learning are causing this spiritual essence to erode and die out.

Dr. Yang does want to maintain that balanced triad of human attributes in his martial teachings, and why in this video he stresses developing and refining the entire human being: body, mind and spirit becoming as one functional essence, harmoniously in balance with nature and the surrounding environment.  This DVD's conditioning and training methods succeed at illustrating at least one approach to achieve this goal.  Well done!  And this second volume is a great continuation, progressing naturally with the first DVD addressing total conditioning of the martial practitioner.",1345680000,4,5678,5.468499427262314
5168429,2,B008KL4TJE,"This DVD was a disappointment. It was a rehash of other DVD and books produced by YMAA at a high level. There were limited conditioning examples as opposed to the first DVD which I would recommend. The various segments were done by the students at the school. It seemed for the student taught segments, they were were fulfilling a teaching requirement for their education. The demonstrations were limited, and shown from only 1 angle and the camera did not provide good coverage of what was being covered.

Disappointed after having ordered other videos from YMAA in the past and knowing the quality of the DVDs they provide and the in-depth knowledge they share.",1344556800,5,663,4.867256637168142

8528676,5,B008KL4TJE,"The purpose of the information in this 2-dvd series is to establish the first necessary step in martial arts training - to put the student's body into excellent condition in preparation for the rigors of the martial arts training to come....both to develop the student's strength to properly perform that training, as well as to help strengthen the body's defense against injuries.

There is a wealth of clearly-presented information and guidance for each of the different conditioning exercises.  In addition, variations of different degrees of difficulty are presented to continually challenge the student as he or she gains strength and endurance in their progression from beginning to advanced stages.  Although some of the advanced conditioning exercises might appear to be extremely difficult to some people, there is so much helpful information that is of great value; and conditioning exercises, stretches, range of motion movements and meditation that are of immediate benefit and ARE possible right now to a beginner.  And, as the student attends to the things that they can do at this time, they will discover that they are doing things that at one time seemed impossible to them.

I recall occasions where Dr. Yang has mentioned on other dvds that skills in martial arts, as well as other aspects of internal and external training, result only from long and dedicated work; and this 2-dvd series is a good reminder of that.  But, this information clearly shows the student the way to establish an excellent physical and mental foundation for those skills to develop upon.",1419033600,,1583,5.1640625
8528677,5,B008KL4TJE,"This is a grate video to assist someone in conditioning the body. I would suggest you start with the first video and then progress to this one its not necessary. I thought they did a great job displaying what you are doing and how to do it.

8528678,4,B008KL4TJE,"Although I'll agree with Bob of CNY ""Bob of CNY"" who stated that this was a rehash of the first DVD primarily presented by Dr. Yang's students, this is more of a progression from the first DVD, intended to show more advanced exercises from first year's exercises.

All in all, the series of DVD 1 and 2 are worthwhile and valuable resources in my martial arts library.",1364774400,,368,4.492537313432836
8528679,5,B008KL4TJE,"Dr. Yang' s second installation of Kung Fu body conditioning is truly a wonderful addition to my physical fitness library!!!! With various additional exercises for the different areas of the human body and mental and spiritual exercise, this will definitely complement any physical fitness/ holistic enthusiast's personal library.",1352505600,,330,5.895833333333333
8528680,4,B008KL4TJE,Wonderful. Comprehensive whole body conditioning.  What I like the most is that you are shown many techniques you can build your own conditioning routine from.  Excellently done.,1351987200,,178,5.555555555555555
8528681,5,B008KL4TJE,"Volume 2 is a nice continuation of the information given in the first volume DVD. It is every bit of good, informative and interesting as Volume 1; more emphasis is given to Qigong which is of great interest to me.

The DVD is compartmented into four sections with Qigong being the first. In this segment, Dr Yang explains and demonstrates the history, theory and movements of Qigong. He has his students perform several variations of this art and explains why each one is important to the student.

Dr. Yang explains how Grand Circulation is so important to developing energy and to bring about a stronger Chi (life energy). The different methods of breathing exercises are shown and described step by step.

Like Volume 1, there are conditioning exercises, and outdoor exercises. There is also a section demonstrating partner drills which I found to be very interesting and add to an excellent workout.

In the concluding section, there is a discussion of the importance of preserving Kung Fu
and the deeper meaning of the Martial Arts.

My conclusion is that both volumes are important and should be in the library of any martial art student.

I especially appreciated that there both volumes include a several page pamphlet which lists the sections and the Chinese and English names of the various exercises.",1350345600,2,1312,4.9409090909090905
8528682,5,B008KL4TJE,"Although, I am not a martial artist, I have been a long time fan of Dr. Yang's teachings. I have found that his ideas and principles have great merit and value.  This DVD, Kung Fu Body Conditioning 2, piqued my interest as it helps to build the body and is good for your health.",1346198400,,278,4.148148148148148
8528683,4,B008KL4TJE,"This video is a welcome addition to my collection. From a sheer value perspective, YMAA has done an excellent job of giving customers the most for their money. Many companies would have broken this information up into four DVDs, one hour a piece and charged $30-$40 each. This DVD is one disc, $39.95, and they didn't cut corners on production value. While you wouldn't mistake this for a Hollywood movie, the quality of filming and clarity of information is well above average. Interestingly, this particular video is the second in a 2-part series, yet it doesn't feel as if the first is needed to understand the content. Both parts appear to be separately functional.

The format begins and ends with discussion from Dr. Yang. He guides the viewer through qigong exercises and philosophical discussions. The bulk of the actual physical training is done by his retreat students. They perform aptly, and while their presentation is a bit more stiff than the veteran Yang, each exercise is thoroughly understandable.

I approached this video looking for ways to enhance my kiko and hojo undo training, and I got just that. The internal qigong aspects emphasized throughout the tape are very interesting and clearly applicable to classical training. Individuals who don't care for discussions on chi or energy may find some of the drills too esoteric for their taste, but that's ok. With so much content, the viewer can easily pick and choose which pieces they want to incorporate into their own regiment.",1345766400,2,1503,5.008
8528684,5,B008KL4TJE,"This is my 22nd YMAA DVD, and it has been one of the most beneficial to me in the last 2 out of 5 years that I have been collecting them for. Just as Dr Yang stresses, conditioning the body is traditionally and ideally the first step before training martial arts, and even if you don't have the will and patience to do so first, it's still worth training the exercises included in both of the Kung Fu Body Conditioning DVDs. Some of the exercises included in this DVD that have mostly benefited me, include; linking kicks,jumping speed drills, and candle staring. These exercises were included in one of Dr Yang's first books 'Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu' (1981) and more than 30 years later they are finally shown in video footage. Also just like with the Long Fist DVD's, this one also includes a more detailed instruction on six of the basic kicks trained in the style as well as the 10 stances. I would strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who is keen on learning and training real conditioning exercises for martial arts. I absolutely love YMAA's material, it never fails to impress me!",1345680000,,1090,4.566326530612245
