7932926,5,B0000577IQ,I saw this years ago on maybe PBS or some network that had no commercials and have never been able to see it again.  I remember loving it and wishing to find or make a copy of it.  No success.  I don't understand why after so much time and obviously a good deal of demand why a copy that can be enjoyed in region 1 can't be released?,1506470400,,333,3.8676470588235294
7932927,1,B0000577IQ,"Took a return trip to U.K. To get to start. I knew it wasn't US format, but in long experience these work in computers. This one didn't.
So in UK I found DVD repeatedly stopped. Was under the label, this unseen, broken.
Too late to return but truly a problem with used media and careless sellers.",1499126400,,296,4.303571428571429
7932928,5,B0000577IQ,Just as wonderful as I remembered! Wish it were available in US format.,1486425600,,71,4.538461538461538
7932929,5,B0000577IQ,I love this Trevor Nunn musical version. Why isn't it available in Region 1?,1445385600,,76,4.5
7932930,5,B0000577IQ,"Fun, Fun, Fun.....what a treat. Again the Shakespeare repertory theater shines again. It is so great to watch British actors we all know now performing for a live audience at the Royal Shakespeare Company. The play is actually occurring as the audience members are being seated. And, at the plays end.the individual cast members step into the audience to chat and thank.  How can you make theater going more personal than that.
As for the play itself...acting is fabulous and funny, songs and dancing are  energetic and so entertaining.
Was able to use my MacBook and  Mac Superdrive DVD player which can be set for region 2 and 4 to watch this on my TV. Cheaper than buying  Region free dvd player.",1444953600,,699,4.704918032786885
7932931,5,B0000577IQ,"This is my favorite version of The Comedy of Errors....I taped it off of TV years ago and it is a treasure.
I hope the BBC will make a DVD version of it, as it is delightful with a great cast.",1413331200,,192,3.707317073170732
7932932,5,B0000577IQ,"This version benefits primarily from stellar actors in their prime, many of whom, like Dame Judy Dench, are now well-known to everyone. It's wonderful to catch them in a Shakespeare performance from the early 1970's, when the most fantastic performances of British productions ever done were captured on film. Don't miss it!",1396915200,2,324,5.25
7932933,5,B0000577IQ,"How can you go wrong with a British Comedy of Errors. Jewdy Dench before she became a Dame.

Dated but real good.

This is region 2. It will not play in hardware DVD players without a hassle. The same for computers.

Get an All Regions DVD players for this and other gems Shakespeare from GB.

There should never be a Region coding. It is disgusting.",1354147200,5,350,4.338461538461538
7932934,4,B0000577IQ,"Why isn't this available in the United States???

That's my first question.  I had to order a Region 2 bootleg copy about 5 years ago just to see this again -- first saw it on and old VHS in England in the '80s.

A wonderful cast, and it's fascinating to see Trevor Nunn (director of the stage production that was essentially restaged for a live taping) itching to direct a musical and instead trying to turn ""Errors"" into one.  Guess he did pretty well with that genre later on.  It almost works here, though some of the songs are weak and go on too long.  But the sense of fun and play is contagious and still comes across -- it's clear this would have been a blast to see in the theater.

The delightful Roger Rees, too often underappreciated, is wonderful here and gets to show off his comic timing.  Dench is perfect, her late husband is great as Dromio of Syracuse.... and the Dr. Pinch scene alone is worth the price.  Buy a region-free DVD player, Shakespeare fans in the U.S., and treat yourself to this classic if you've never seen it.  Not all of it works, but it really does capture a moment when the RSC was chock-full of brilliant players and genius directors.  If I remember correctly, this was just a year or two before ""Nicholas Nickleby"" and the Nunn ""Macbeth"" -- Trevor was on a big-time roll and just didn't stop for a decade or so.

This production also has the late great Griffith Jones.  If you saw the RSC any time in the '70s or '80s, you saw him and his amazing white beard....

So, please, please, someone do the right thing and introduce this to the U.S. DVD market.  It holds up very well as a filmed Shakespeare comedy, which is not an easy thing to pull off.",1344211200,7,1689,4.334394904458598
