6452216,5,B00KW85NXO,Was very excited to see this bundle package...have had Doc Martin marathons since its delivery.  Love it!,1408579200,3,105,5.176470588235294
6452217,5,B00KW85NXO,"Do you own any Doc Martin? This is a bundle, a large bundle, and all good. I own them all already, having gotten them as they were originally released. This is a much cheaper way to own them. But if you already own a series or two, you might be duplicating. If you are new to Doc Martin, get this deal, all of it, you will be glad.

Doc Martin is one of the funniest British series I have watched in the past decade.
This winning hit combines a country doctor, who faints at the sight of blood, with quirky villagers, and fantastic English seaside visual charm. It is a character driven series and you will come to love and laugh at the entire town. Now the entire 46 episode series is packaged together, along with 2 TV movies that spawned the series. It's a must-see-all opportunity in the full-deal package. A set to own, for continuing viewing privilege; time after time.

SUBTITLES- yes! and for the bonus stuff too. Bonus as good as the episodes.
TV Season 1: Martin Clunes plays the London surgeon moving into sleepy Portwenn. Viewers are introduced to characters so odd they become household names. 6 episodes of hysterical hilarity.
2: Nine new episodes fail to ease the surly self-centered doctor. Romance (Caroline Catz) lingers on Cornish fishing village streets.
3: Doc's aunt (Stephanie Cole) is one of the less eccentric locals through the season's 7 episodes. Bert Large (Ian McNeice) plumber turned chef is wildly goofy as is Doc's receptionist.
4: The previous season ended in a surprise and they continue in 8 episodes with romance and blood sparking rumors, even a ghost.
5: Doc Martin (Martin Clunes) had packed prepared for a new position out of Portwenn. But girlfriend Louisa, a nameless son, & Aunt did not love his planned exit. That was then. Now we have 8 new episodes, and enjoy you will.
6: Things move fast in the port village with weddings, babies, crime, and goofy stuff. 8 episodes in season 6.
THE MOVIES: Doc Martin- 87 min. Doc discovers 3 doctor friends have bedded his wife. A trip to seclusion ends in Port Isaac mud and a lobster boat gig.
Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie- 75 min. Doc stoops to cloutie-ing to get an out-of-the-way home he must fight for.

You will never regret buying this HUGE 46 episode plus 2 feature length movie bundle. Laugh from minute one till the end.
Not enough of Martin Clunes yet?--Try ""Dirty Tricks"" and ""Reggie Perrin.""",1408320000,26,2402,4.633802816901408

When Doc Martin began on PBS, they loved the show, but missed many episodes, and were disappointed when their local PBS station dropped it.  I have binged on Doc Martin with streaming video, and have rewatched several times.  So, this was my birthday present to my mom.

6452230,4,B00KW85NXO,"They arrived on time, and Doc Martin is hilarious. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because in both cases the movable disc holder was broken (so moving freely). No discs were damaged, it is just an inconvenience.",1516233600,,218,4.475

I like the British sense of humor that is threaded throughout the story. The script is well cast. Each actor is perfectly suited to his/her individual role.

6452237,4,B00KW85NXO,"There are many episodes that I have missed, over the years, watching this series on TV, so I thought to catch up on what I hadn't seen, and watch in sequence.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars, was because the second disc from Season Two does not appear to be readable on our new BluRay/DVD player. I hope there will not be other faulty discs in this set, and I hope there can be some recourse for a partially faulty product.",1512777600,,436,4.129411764705883

6452275,5,B00KW85NXO,"Great purchase; great value, though you can find them on YouTube. Every show a gem. I enjoy each one twice before moving on to the next. They are that good. Real people, real situations, laughs at every turn. Acting is so good, and God knows where they found the actors for these parts; all appear to be born to play their roles. My favorite moments require the use of a remote in order order to savor the look on someone's face that says so much about who they are and how they fit into the world created by producer Dominic Minghella.

One such moment is the revelatory one at hospital in season 1 when Doc Martin suddenly opens up about his fear of blood and his loss of his family to the ex-teacher Roger Fenn, who lies in bed after his cancer operation. In this scene, the previous outright animosity between them is transformed in a flash to trust and friendship. It happens with blunt Roger's probing sarcasm when Martin says he no longer speaks with his parents:

Roger Fenn: You are a miserable bugger.
Dr. Martin Ellingham: [taking this as a compliment] Thank you.

And the scene goes on, as if nothing much has happened. But so much has happened. In a flash these adversaries have become intimates.

Every show has ten or 15 moments like this from writer Dominic Minghella.",1493510400,2,1284,4.521551724137931
6452276,5,B00KW85NXO,"I'm on my third time through this series. It is the funniest and at the same time most heart-rending story I've seen. I highly recommend it for pure enjoyment. Doc Martin is the nastiest, rudest person while at the same time being an excellent doctor. He has deep heart wounds that make him unable to truly relate properly to anyone, but he does find a love in the end.",1492560000,,369,4.36231884057971

6452279,5,B00KW85NXO,"'Doc Martin' is one of those shows, I have found that gets better as it ages. However, the first year was very entertaining. There was something a little hit strange about he main character, Doc Martin, played by Martin Clunes, but, since he was a surgeon, that made some sense.

Dr. Martin Ellingham, a London surgeon developed a horrible reaction to the sight of blood. He also dies not have a good bedside manner, and he looks for another job. A GP is needed in a small village in a Cornish fishing village. He had spent summers there and, indeed, loved the area.

Martin was written and created by Dominic Minghella. Martin became the charmless, and insensitive physician, who is a brilliant diagnostician. He is so impossible I felt myself rooting for him. He is an off beat but good man. Once he is in the village, he sets up an office, people come by just to see him, and then they all develop unusual conditions, that he can almost always solve. In the process he falls in love with the schoolteacher Louisa, played by Carolyn Catz. She discovers she is attracted to him, but she doesn't really like him.

Every week a new medical condition is discovered, often including a interesting storyline. Doc Martin gains weight and loves the town. The town is an intricate turn of hillside streets and scenic overlooks. The town characters are the receptionists Lucy Punch and Katherine Parkinson; Ian McNeice, as a plumber ; Joe Absolom as McNeice's son; Stewart Wright and John Marquez as police constables, and Stephanie Cole as Martin's stubborn Aunt Joan. I began to think quite often that Doc Martin has Aspergers. He has all the characteristics. But, it makes no difference, really. This is a character who has soul, a romantic comedy we can all relate to.

6452282,5,B00KW85NXO,"How could anyone not love Doc Martin himself, and the series as a whole?  We sometimes talk about Doc and the probability that he suffers from Asperger's Syndrome.  It is a testament to his character that he was able to complete medical school and become a top-notch surgeon.  One of the key points is that when his patients finally understand that the Dr. Ellingham really cares about them and he will do whatever it takes to give them the best possible treatment, they accept his eccentricity and then tolerate it, more or less.  Everyone loves Louisa, and the other wonderful characters in this irresistible series.",1489795200,,618,4.857142857142857

It was, at first, a lovely love story of him and a teacher, Caraoline Catz , but his maladjustment to society soon presented mega problems between them, destroying the romance, making it lackluster and uninteresting.

Great character development, just a great show that combines humor, drama and personal interaction, all in a beautiful small British coastal village setting.

When I found this deal on Amazon with two movies too, I purchased it for my husband's birthday.  (He quickly reminded me that I liked the series as much as he did so it is really for both of us.)  So far we have watched the first six series from beginning to end twice in February and purchased the seventh season too.

Doc Martin is wonderful, funny, full of crazy characters and how he can keep a straight face with all the ridiculous situations is beyond me but Martin Clunes as Doc Martin is excellent.  Over the years we have watched many series and this is at our number one list.  I was also happy to read that they just signed to do season 8 with an option for three more ~ Yeah!

The movies do not fit with the series but do star Martin Clunes and are very good as stand-alone films although he plays another version of Doc Martin in them.",1454889600,11,979,4.121052631578947

[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

If you have not already invested in the earlier ""Doc Martin"" DVDs, the most economical way to acquire the series is to buy this new Season 1-6 box.
It also includes the two made-for-TV ""Martin Bamford"" movies (see below).
From the start, Doc Martin has had English SDH subtitles and is presented in the 16:9 widescreen mode.

Season Seven is NOT in this box.
You have to buy it separately:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Series-7-Blu-ray/dp/B011T0C7CI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin, Series 7 [Blu-ray</a>]
Season Seven is the first time the series will be released on both Blu-Ray and DVD.

-- there was also a Season 1-5 box:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Special-Collection-Series-1-5-plus-the-Movies/dp/B00A27O0N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin Special Collection: Series 1-5 plus the Movies</a>
but you would then need Season Six (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Series-6/dp/B00FPPQYXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin Series 6</a>) in addition to Season Seven.

Both the Season 1-6 box and the Season 1-5 box also include the two made-for-TV ""Martin Bamford"" movies.
The Season 1-6 box is  packaged in two multi-disc DVD cases which slide into into an attractive cardboard slipcase.
The Season 1-5 box had six DVD cases (one for each season and the movies).

I haven't heard of any plans to go back and re-issue the first six Seasons on Blu-Ray,
---------------------------------------------------------

SERIES OVERVIEW:
Mr. Martin Ellingham (played by Martin Clunes) was a brilliant and prestigious surgeon in London,
who developed an unexplained aversion to the sight of blood (""Hemophobia"").
Unable to function, he retired to his boyhood home of Portwennn,
where he becomes Dr. Martin Ellingham, the brilliant General Practitioner.
No longer prestigious - local teens call him ""Tosser""
His receptionist is charged with drawing blood from patients.

TRIVIA:
Portwenn is portrayed by the picturesque seaside village of Port Isaac (population 721) in Cornwall, in the extreme southwest of Britain.
Impossibly beautiful real estate.
Port Isaac is nine miles down the coast from Tintagel, home of Tintagel Castle, legendary birthplace of King Arthur.*

""Mister"" = British surgeons are medical doctors, but in hospital they are addressed as ""Mister"" not ""Doctor""
(when Doc Martin visits his old hospital in Season One, a former colleague addresses him as ""Mr. Ellingham"" - before correcting himself).
This is a holdover from the Nineteenth Century:
Doctors diagnosed the patient's problem, then turned the poor fellow over to the Surgeon for treatment (usually amputation).
Surgeons were skilled craftsmen.
The faster they worked, the greater likelihood the patient would survive the operation.
Irony - In the Twentieth Century, surgery became the prestigious specialty.

""Tosser"" = British slang. A male who masturbates:  An objectionable male.
Synonymous with ""wanker""

""Going Bodmin"" is a phrase sometimes encountered on the show.
Bodmin (population 15,000) is a town thirteen miles south of  Port Isaac.
Home to the 200 year-old Bodmin County Lunatic Asylum.
""Going Bodmin"" means you are mentally ill.
Bodmin is also home to Bodmin Prison.

EARLY YEARS: DR. MARTIN BAMFORD
Martin Clunes originally played a character named ""Dr Martin Bamford"" in three prequels to the TV series.
- 2000: ""Saving Grace"" =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Grace/dp/B00003CXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Grace</a>
- 2001: ""Doc Martin"" (TV movie) and
- 2003: ""Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie"" (TV movie) =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOC-MARTIN-THE-MOVIES/dp/B0050N0UR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOC MARTIN: THE MOVIES</a>
The two TV movies (but not ""Saving Grace"") are also included in the Season 1-5 box and the Season 1-6 box.

Doc Martin is a minor character in ""Saving Grace"" (starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson), but he is the lead character  in the two TV movies.
Dr. Martin Bamford is a London obstetrician who discovers that his wife has been unfaithful.
Bitter and depressed, he moves to Port Isaac, a small seacoast town in Cornwall which he remembers from his childhood.
Filmed in Port Isaac, not yet known as ""Portwenn"".
The setting is the same, but the supporting cast is different (including a different love interest).
Martin Bamford is not Martin Ellingham.
He drinks and smokes (tobacco and otherwise), and has no problem getting his hands dirty by helping out on a local fishing boat.

SERIES 1-7: DR. MARTIN ELLINGHAM:
Dr. Bamford was not really going anywhere, so writer Dominic Minghella was called in to rethink the series' premise, and to create a new cast of supporting characters.
The first thing he did was change the doctor's name from Dr. Martin Bamford to Dr. Martin Ellingham.
""Ellingham"" is an anagram of ""Minghella"".

The revised series debuted in 2004 - New seasons have appeared at approximately two year intervals.
If you are new to Doc Martin, by all means start with Season One and watch the series in chronological order.
The plot line that begins with the first episode is still developing.
Save the ""Dr. Martin Bamford"" movies for last.  Though technically ""prequels"", they add nothing to the TV series.

2004 was also the year that ""House"" debuted on American television.
Doctors Gregory House and Martin Ellingham have a lot in common:
Brilliant physicians but dysfunctional human beings (House is also a secret Brit).
Each show is a combination of Medical Detective Story and comedy.
""House"" is much darker comedy - ""Doc Martin"" can sometimes seem a bit silly.
My two favorite TV shows of the 21st Century.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* CAMELOT CONNECTION
Tintagel Castle (nine miles north of Port Isaac) is the birthplace of the legend of King Arthur.
Uther Pendragon, King of Britain, falls in love with Igraine, wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall.
Gorlois believes his wife is safely protected within the walls of Tintagel Castle.
Under a spell from the wizard Merlin, Uther Pendragon assumes the appearance of Gorlois in order to gain entry.
Igraine believes him to be her husband, and ""in that night was the most famous of men, Arthur, conceived.""
(Geoffrey of Monmouth, 'Historia Regum Britanniae', written in 1136)

Prior to Doc Martin, Tintagel Castle was the most popular tourist attraction in Cornwall.
Photo 1 = Port Isaac
Photo 2 = Tintagel Castle
Photo 3 = Convenient footpath connecting the two (pay no attention to the broken footbridge)

The stretch of coast from Port Isaac to Tintagel is pretty isolated real estate.
The Port Isaac railway station closed in 1966.
Doc Martin is filmed in the summer, when the weather in Cornwall is almost Mediterranean.
Cornwall has the mildest and sunniest climate in the United Kingdom, due to its southerly latitude and the influence of the Gulf Stream.
Penzance, 55 miles southwest of Port Isaac, is the most popular seaside resort in Cornwall (thanks to Gilbert & Sullivan).

Photo 8 is a satellite photo of the Port Isaac region.
It shows a five mile stretch of coastline (Tintagel is a further four miles up the coast)
The inlet on the left is Port Isaac.
The next inlet is Port Gaverne, practically a suburb of Port Isaac.
Too shallow for fishing boats - Port Gaverne is basically a tourist beach.

P.S. I have a hopeless crush on Caroline Catz, the actress who plays Doc Martin's love interest Louisa Glasson.
Surprisingly, she has also had a parallel career in law enforcement:
In 2004, the year Doc Martin debuted, she was Detective Inspector Kate Ashurst in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-in-Suburbia-Complete-Collection/dp/B00KCA32XK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder in Suburbia Complete Collection</a>.
This was a fairly lightweight (but enjoyable) police series.
In 2012, she joined the cast of DCI Banks, where she plays Detective Inspector Helen Morton, a much darker character:

Had I seen that first I'd never would have ordered the series. And funny thing is that the series is so loosely based on the movie you wouldn't know it was the same story for the most part.

6452431,5,B00KW85NXO,"Already own any Doc Martin? This is a collection of all Doc Martin, and all good. I own them all already, gotten when originally released. This is a cheaper way to own them. But if you already own a series or two, you might be duplicating. If you are new to Doc Martin, get this deal, all of it, you will be glad. There is a Series 7 releasing on DVD the same day. Might want to pick that up as well. It seems like a lot of money, but it covers a lot of film, all funny, all worth watching multiple times. Funny folks that make your cheeks hurt from laughing.

Doc Martin is one of the funniest British series I have watched in the past decade.
This winning hit combines a country doctor, who faints at the sight of blood, with quirky villagers, and fantastic English seaside visual charm. It is a character driven series and you will come to love and laugh at the entire town. Now the entire series is packaged together, along with 2 TV movies that spawned the series. It's a must-see-all opportunity in the full-deal package. A set to own, for continuing viewing privilege; time after time.

SUBTITLES- yes! and for the bonus stuff too. Bonus as good as the episodes.
TV Season 1: Martin Clunes plays the London surgeon moving into sleepy Portwenn. Viewers are introduced to characters so odd they become household names. 6 episodes of hysterical hilarity.
2: Nine new episodes fail to ease the surly self-centered doctor. Romance (Caroline Catz) lingers on Cornish fishing village streets.
3: Doc's aunt (Stephanie Cole) is one of the less eccentric locals through the season's 7 episodes. Bert Large (Ian McNeice) plumber turned chef is wildly goofy as is Doc's receptionist.
4: The previous season ended in a surprise and they continue in 8 episodes with romance and blood sparking rumors, even a ghost.
5: Doc Martin (Martin Clunes) had packed prepared for a new position out of Portwenn. But girlfriend Louisa, a nameless son, & Aunt did not love his planned exit. That was then. Now we have 8 new episodes, and enjoy you will.
6: Things move fast in the port village with weddings, babies, crime, and goofy stuff. 8 episodes in season 6.
THE MOVIES: Doc Martin- 87 min. Doc discovers 3 doctor friends have bedded his wife. A trip to seclusion ends in Port Isaac mud and a lobster boat gig.
Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie- 75 min. Doc stoops to cloutie-ing to get an out-of-the-way home he must fight for.

You'll not regret buying this HUGE 46 episode plus 2 feature length movie collection. Laugh from minute one until the end.
Not enough of Martin Clunes yet?--Try ""Dirty Tricks"" and ""Reggie Perrin.""",1438214400,60,2620,4.605995717344753

6452471,4,B00KW85NXO,"I am really enjoying the Dr. Martin series. I did not see more than a few episodes on PBS, so having the whole series has been a joy.  My only complaint is that indexing was cumbersome.  When I interrupted my watching, and made the mistake of turning off my player, I could not find where I was easily. Plus I wish it came in HD to make the beauty of the setting more enjoyable.  Standard pic on a HD TV is blurry. Enjoyable though.",1418688000,,432,4.119047619047619

Kinda out there, but you fall for the characters after the first few episodes.  Martin Clunes is fantastic as the cranky but brilliant surgeon serving as the local doctor for a Cornish village populated with colorful people.  Great supporting cast.  Once you start, you can't resist watching.  With all the junk polluting major networks, this series is a breath of fresh air.",1416528000,15,515,4.930232558139535

I had fallen into watching Doc Martin by accident so learning the full story is great. My only wish is that there would be further seasons of Doc Martin as they continue their lives.

Please please please encourage Martin ClunesSpace to have further seasons of the show even if any of the original players had to be replaced.

6452492,5,B00KW85NXO,"Addiction has set in.  We have the series on Instant Video, and our internet went out for a time so I just ordered the DVDs.  If a Doc Martin episode comes on PBS, we will likely catch it there, as well.  The episodes get better with each new season, and funnier with multiple viewing.  The characters on Doc Martin are loveable folks with funny flaws -- think of Barney Fife or Otis Campbell on the old Andy Griffith show.  John Marquez as Police Constable Joseph Penhale is our favorite, but all of the regular characters are memorable.  This show captures the beauty of a charming village in Cornwall, and has caused me to read about the place and want to visit.  Camera work, music and sound are all exceptional -- can you use the word ""cinematography"" to describe a British comedy / drama?  The visuals of the Cornish coast are excellent.  Nice production in every way.  Hope they remaster these shows on Blu-Ray HD, and I will buy them yet again.  The global following of Doc Martin is an amazing story, and the show has been adapted in multiple foreign countires.  This bundle package was the best price to for buying the whole series on DVD.  The movies are interesting additions for Doc Martin fans, but not the exact storyline as the TV series.

Update: The DVDs came right on time, and there is something on the DVDs lacking in the instant videos: Bonus Material -- behind the scene interviews, photos, etc., not a big surprise.  For Doc Martin addicts, this is great stuff!",1411516800,12,1485,4.571969696969697

6452498,5,B00KW85NXO,"This is a terrific series.  Martin Clunes is brilliant as the curmudgeonly Dr. Ellingham, displaced by late-onset blood phobia from his career as a London surgeon to general practice in a small seaside village in Cornwall.  Many if the medical situations (over-medication, diabetes, environmental toxins, inappropriate use of prescription drugs, etc.) encountered by the doctor will resonate with contemporary medical problems experienced by viewers.  Likewise, some of the classroom situations encountered by Doc Martin's ""friend"" Louisa Glasson, head-teacher at the local elementary school will be familiar to educators.  Underlying the entire series is the overwhelming contradiction between the social expectations one normally entertains of a doctor and the utter inability of Dr. Ellingham to ""deliver"" the requisite bedside manner.  Is he autistic or just stubbornly individualistic?",1410307200,7,890,6.031746031746032

But Doc Martin not only surpassed that, but #2 is not even close to #1.  Town with quirky characters, some insane story lines; very creative, and even the rather unbelievable ones are done in such a way that it has me wanting more - which is why I purchased this even though I have already seen them before.  Now I can watch whenever I want; whatever episode.  And the price for 6 seasons makes this a great deal!!",1525305600,,587,4.429906542056075
