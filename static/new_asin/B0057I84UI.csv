8460733,5,B0057I84UI,This season is one of few that have actually been released on DVD.  There's a reason for that.  It's one of the best.  I went into the season not knowing much and if you watch it I would tell you to do the same.  Besides a few lackluster episodes towards the end of the season this is perfect.  1-10 are great television.  This is what the real world is meant to be.  Each episode has you feeling a lot of emotion.  The cast is extremely likable and...not so much at times.  Just like people are in the real life.,1417564800,,513,4.101010101010101
8460734,3,B0057I84UI,"This season was okay. I'm happy to see the real world on DVD, but I really wish that there would be a release of the older seasons. Even if the music had to be changed, like in the season one release, or if the music had to be removed, I would still like to have the chance to purchase every season on DVD. I appreciate Amazon giving fans the chance to buy seasons of shows that have never been available before.",1405382400,,412,4.098765432098766
8460735,4,B0057I84UI,"This season while maybe not my favorite was a really fun watch. At the end of the day, I'm just really glad that The Real World is getting releases again. I hope the sales on this are decent enough for them to try other seasons, so that I can eventually own my fav seasons, Like Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, Denver...even some of the newer seasons like New Orleans 2.0 or Cancun..or maybe even some Road Rules seasons and ofcourse the challenges...Hopefully somebody is listening :)",1322870400,3,483,4.694117647058824
8460736,5,B0057I84UI,"This series is the best season in about 10 years. Every episode had lots of intense drama! The best character was Adam Royer who caused nothing but problems for his other house mates. He smashed a bottle in a night club, got taken out by 5 bouncers and given a warning by the hotel manager. He refused to apologise to any of the other house mates. He then got in a fight with Leroy, manipulated a stunning girl called Nany and caused $2,000 worth of damages to the hotel suite they were staying in. Eventually he would be kicked off the show in episode 6 but returns in episode 12 to make a spectacular reappearance. This one season has more thrills and spills than the last 5 seasons of Real World combined. This should be a must buy purchase for every fan of reality tv. While I agree MTV need to release the other seasons on DVD, the best way to get this to happen is to purchase this season.",1317254400,2,895,4.270588235294118
8460737,1,B0057I84UI,This season was douchebags and dumb girls on parade.  It was awful and everyone involved should be humiliated.  What's with MTV?  Where are the older seasons?  Where is San Fran and Boston and Seattle?  These new ones are all about being trashy and disgusting and blacking out every night.,1313712000,6,289,4.816326530612245
