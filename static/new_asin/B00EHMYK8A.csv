8605336,4,B00EHMYK8A,"This 1967 TV series was produced in Hollywood. Each 20 minute episode featured a celebrity guest playing billiards with the legendary Minnesota Fats. MF is big in both size and ego. Hes also good. Watching the guest opponent play against him is like watching the Washington Generals basketball, team play the Harlem Globetrotters (its almost impossible to win).

For this DVD(Volume 1  the first in a series?) there are 3 25-minute episodes (commercials have been excised) each with a comedian (or  in the case of the Smothers Brothers  comedians) as the opponent.  Ive watched DVDs of Celebrity Bowling (another 1970s show) and found the comments during play to be funny. Thats not the case here. Groucho Marx adlibs a few times but his great wit doesnt come through. He does talk about how his brothers played pool (billiards) during their travels in vaudeville. Next up are the Smothers Brothers. Both are serious players  especially Tommy  and are seriously playing to win. We learn that they had a table in their basement when they grew up. Next up is Milton Berle and, though he has obviously shot pool, he is there to give one-liners.

For the first two episodes the game is pocket billiards while Berle plays the pin cushion version.

Each episode has an announcer and Ted Travers hosts the Smothers and Berle ones, while Jim Pearsall (Better known as Jimmy, the legendary baseball pitcher  whose life story was told in the movie Fear Strikes Out) hots the Groucho episode.

Also on screen at all times is a pretty model (two are blondes and one a brunette) who are there obviously to provide Scenery. They never move or speak.

Obviously this release from the library of Kit Parker Films (and released on DVD by VCI) is aimed at billiard players. Im afraid Im not one who has played, and so the terminology used by the players was lost to me. But, if you know the game, youll probably be impressed by all the players.

Even though the show is in English, VCI has thoughtfully provided easy to read subtitles. This will help the hearing impaired but also others (like me) because, while the images are sharp, the sound of the original syndicated show is often muffled.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8605337,5,B00EHMYK8A,"These entertaining shows have not aired in over 45 years. They bring back memories. I hope the producer of this product offers more collections from this old show. Also, Fats starred in another show from the same time period using another format. The show, Minnesota Fats Hustles the Pros, pitted Fats against  other top players of the era. It also was a syndicated program out of Chicago around 1967. Although Celebrity Billiards is entertaining, this other program would have historical value for the sport of pocket billiards. There has been no source for either show, up until now. I hope the producer of this compilation can uncover episodes of Minnesota Fats Hustles the Pros and continues releasing further volumes of Celebrity Billiards.",1387584000,2,745,5.10655737704918
