Sang-nam is given the opportunity to redeem himself by coaching a hearing impaired high school team, and he reluctantly agrees. Glove is a mesmerizing and touching film.

The story in this film has been done before; the story and character arcs are very familiar. A reluctant, grumpy down on his luck athlete, an opportunity for redemption, an underdog team shooting for the stars, etc.; but, does that make it any less compelling? Of course not. The story is deep and will hit home for many viewers; it's motivational, as well as thought-provoking. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you angry, and some scenes will make you cheer. The performances are all feel very authentic, which add to the emotion. The ending of the film is memorable, and may even be a bit unexpected for some viewers. The music in the film was great, really matched the tone of the film.

Overall, Glove is a powerful, compelling, and even triumphant film. It's a story that may feel familiar, but manages to have an identity of it's own by the end. As of 3/9/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, although a purchase is highly recommended.

Glove is safe for all audiences.",1364083200,,1302,4.829596412556054
