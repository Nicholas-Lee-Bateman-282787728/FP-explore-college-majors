7843755,5,6303342779,"NukuNuku is a charming high school girl with a childish but sincere attitude, long, pink hair, large eyes, and the mind of a cat!
The first video explains how NukuNuku came to be, as well as the daily problems that she has to deal with.  She would love to simply attend school, and sunbathe while munching something good.  Unfortunately, her ""papa-san's"" wife has other ideas.  Furious at her husband for leaving his job at Mishima heavy Inudstries (a supplier of violent, war machines and lethal robots), she will stop at nothing to reclaim her son, Ryunoske(sp?), who her husband took with him when he left, fearing that a life among war toys was no way for a boy to grow up.
NukuNuku refers to herself as the product of Papa-san and Ryunoske's love, and is the perfect big sister, caretaker, and defender. . .even if she does have a slight tendency to level all the buildings in the area when she fights.
The series is in Japanese, but it's still worth watching.  Some of the lines are priceless!
""But dad, what about NukuNuku?""  ""Never mind NukuNuku, she has to be punished for destroying the city.""",999993600,,1103,4.635897435897436
7843756,5,6303342779,"Nuku Nuku is my favorite anime.  It is the story of a high school android girl who has a cats brain.  It is a very funny comedy that deals with a custody battle between a mother and a father over their son.  The first episodes is about the creation of Nuku Nuku and Nuku Nuku going to high school for the first time, the second episode is about Nuku Nuku going to the beach.  Don't miss this anime.",979084800,,398,4.064102564102564
7843757,4,6303342779,"This is volume 1 of 3.
In essence, this is a child custody battle story marketed as a cute cat girl story. The blending of the two make it quite exceptional:
Papa-san and Mama-san split up. Papa-san runs away with his son taking with his android prototype project. In the resulting shoot-out, their recently adopted stray cat gets killed. Papa-san modifies the android, and the result is an older sister for his son; All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku.
The rest of the story is how Nuku Nuku adapts to her new surroundings (pretending to be human) while deep down she is really a cat, at least at first... Providing situations is Mama-san, a powerful business exec scheming to steal back her son and the android unit.
Lots of laughs, cat humor, destroyed buildings, but the under-lying relationships make this comedy anime plus. Most people should enjoy this one. Virtually all cat lovers will!",972777600,5,899,4.806451612903226
7843758,4,6303342779,"I really liked Cat Girl Nuku Nuku.  The story was cool but I think that it  is time that they finally dub the video.  The mature audiences only warning  on the side is uneeded.  The story does have a very pretty and giddy lead,  and she is interesting to watch.  I think that this video is ok for anyone  above the age of say 13, and is just good old action fun.",965952000,,362,3.9305555555555554
7843759,5,6303342779,"I love this anime.  Anything with a pretty girl that can beat the ---- out of anything she encounters will get my attention.  Not only is it funny, but it is kinda sweet.  Pick it up!",959731200,,183,4.027777777777778
7843760,4,6303342779,"Once upon a time, there is a very brainy scientist who runs away with his young son. And there is a lady villain who sends her faithful female spies after her young son. Somehow a very cuddly cat gets caught up in the very  middle and unfortunately loses its life - much to the tear-stricken grief  of the young son. So his loving dad takes the poor kitty's brain and builds  an android to house it. Thus Nuku The Cat Girl is born in the form of a  very nubile young high-school girl with long, flowing medicine-pink hair  and superhero powers to ward off the stubbornly determined young women  assisted to destroy her and take the innocent little boy back to his  rightful mother. Very hilarious and action-packed as well as a truly  touching portrait of a family which had long ago broken up, yet tenderly  held together by our young heroine the sweet, protective Nuku. But it is  also still another pubescent excuse to check out the sexy, superperfect  body of a fantasy babe like Nuku as a part of the usual peddling from good  ol' Japanese animation.",959212800,5,1055,4.523809523809524
7843761,5,6303342779,"This was a great anime. Hilarious but touching as well. A great example of anime, especially anime comedies. If you like to laugh and don't mind some WAFF's(Warm And Fuzzy Feelings)thrown in, then this is a must see.",948844800,2,216,4.7105263157894735
7843762,5,6303342779,"""A heartwarming story about a boy and his cat....and a major military weapons manufacturer"" as the preview says.  This a two thumbs up movie, and so are the the other two.  I strongly reccomend this as a first  choice to any anime fan!",944092800,3,235,4.4186046511627906
