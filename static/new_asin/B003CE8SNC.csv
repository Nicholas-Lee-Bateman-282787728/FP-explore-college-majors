8394180,2,B003CE8SNC,"I thought this movie would concentrate on the ancient Mayan world.  Instead it was about the lost world of ecology.  The visuals of the Mayan society and South America were great, just not enough.",1470182400,,196,4.735294117647059

8394183,1,B003CE8SNC,"This film certainly dos NOT spend more than a few seconds on mthe subject of ""mayan mysteries""...
The rest is vague, futile,so superficial as to make it a cheat...",1402963200,,163,4.655172413793103

8394185,1,B003CE8SNC,"The video wanders. Also, it fails to live up to its description. It barely mentions the Mayans. I found the video hard to watch.",1369785600,2,128,4.375
8394186,2,B003CE8SNC,"The content of the presentation was good but unfortunately it was difficult to overlook the poor visual and audio quality. The colors were flat and the picture, at times, appeared to be blowing in the wind as if my projection screen were outside on a windy day.",1364688000,3,261,4.574468085106383
8394187,5,B003CE8SNC,"Harrison Ford narrates Lost Worlds, which begins with a visit to the Mayan City of Tikal in Guatemala, which is the home of the black jaguar. Tikal is a lowland city in the small country which is known for its volcanoes. It was abandoned before the Spanish arrived. When Hernan Cortez landed in Mexico and Central America, the Mayans left the lowland areas and fled to the mountains. The Spanish priests who sailed to the New World with Cortez declared that the Mayan religion was a work of the devil and all but a few books or codices were burned. Only three of them survived in European cities. As a result, it took several centuries to decipher them. Thanks to the work of American and Russian (yes, Russian) scholars, we now have accurate information about the Mayans. One of the leading American scholars was a child who spent his summers in the Maya area digging with his parents. He was awarded a McCarthur genius award.
Lost Worlds also visits the endemic life of the Tepuis-an exclusive gallery of plants and insects that exist only on the table top mountains of Venezuela. Also included is Expedition to the Lost World-A behind the scenes exploration to the world's highest waterfall. There are also two children's tales: A Frog's Tale and Shadow's Adventure.
In case you would like to learn some new languages there are five language tracks: English, French, Spanish, Japanese and Korean. If you want to review this blu-ray, you can do it in Korean, impress your friends and earn a genius award.
This blu-ray is impressive. If you don't have a blu-ray player, go buy one. If you want to be difficult watch the included DVD. We don't care. Just don't complain that it is not in HD.",1363305600,8,1691,4.677852348993288
8394188,4,B003CE8SNC,"I enjoyed the piece, although I really didn't know what to expect with IMAX: Lost Worlds, and I bought it because it was voiced by Harrison Ford. But it was decent.",1360454400,,164,4.32258064516129
8394189,1,B003CE8SNC,"harrison ford is only in this show for about five minutes, the rest is filled by unknown people doing things that aree both ugly and un noteworthy!",1355702400,,147,4.481481481481482
