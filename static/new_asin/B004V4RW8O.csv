4481821,5,B004V4RW8O,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to know the truth about what some people like to smoke, versus what other people say is unhealthy. This video goes all through the benefits, as well at the possible negatives associated with pot. If you smoke and want to know the science behind the high, or if you are a drug critique who wants to learn more, get a copy of this DVD. You can't go wrong, regardless of which side of the fence you take on drug ethics, practicality, and physical/mental health concerns.",1333670400,21,505,4.5

4481823,5,B004V4RW8O,"This DVD provides great information on Marijuana, Cocaine and ecstacy in a non judgmental way. As a adolescent substance abuse counselor, I use this video for my groups. Well worth the money.",1310947200,35,191,5.0
4481824,5,B004V4RW8O,One of the more objective videos on the topic I have seen.  Good educational tool to use with clients.,1456704000,,102,4.368421052631579

4481829,4,B004V4RW8O,Very informational.,1420329600,,19,9.0
4481830,2,B004V4RW8O,I am a substance abuse counselor and I bought this to show to my groups.  I am very disappointed in this dvd because it seems to promote the drugs more than it discourages them.  I am anti-drug use and I've chosen NOT to play this dvd for any of my groups.  I'm actually disappointed in National Geographic for the information this dvd provides.  This is a thumbs down for me.,1420156800,,376,4.328571428571428
4481831,4,B004V4RW8O,Good topics.,1419811200,,12,5.5
4481832,3,B004V4RW8O,"I use it in my Substance Abuse groups.  I do see its value because of the actual researchers and the real people who use the drugs.  For my purposes, it could possibly show more negative effects like the other one on Methamphetamine. This film is a little outdated.",1415404800,,265,4.5

4481835,3,B004V4RW8O,"it almost seems like they are promoting marijuana rather than deterring use, I know the U.S. is going in the direction of legalizing but alcohol and cigarettes are legal and we still teach the negative effects, even if it was legal it does not make it healthy.",1392422400,,260,4.553191489361702
4481836,4,B004V4RW8O,I have the first one of these and show them in substance abuse treatment sessions to my clients.  They are some of the best shows dipicting how addiction affects the individual mentally and physically as well as how it affects friends and family.  My only grip is there is no menu at the start of the DVD to pick which episodes you want to see so you have to fast forward though them.  Also really disapointed in National Geographic that they don't have closed captions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing.  Luckily I am able to get the captions to work via my TV.,1391472000,,561,4.314285714285714
4481837,5,B004V4RW8O,"Very informative, use it as a teaching tool. I would recommend this to others to use for education on drug abuse.",1387843200,,113,4.428571428571429
4481838,3,B004V4RW8O,Too slow and it shows too much drug use in a way that almost glorifies it. I would not use it with those newly in recovery due to the possible triggers from the using scenes. A little too technical for most clients.,1383523200,2,215,4.142857142857143
4481839,1,B004V4RW8O,"Although the education is good, this movie has parts showing crazed addicts killing people from news casts, and too much drug using, too trigger provoking for teens.",1370390400,4,165,5.148148148148148
4481840,5,B004V4RW8O,"glad to see this actually view of how drugs physically affect the human body, just would like to see less people hooked on drugs",1369180800,,128,4.375
4481841,1,B004V4RW8O,"This product promotes as a possible therapeutic tool. It is not. Glorifies marijuana use. Contrary to other in-depth studies. Scenes of Bill and Ted BFF's lol who say they are better people for smoking weed. Then stoned kids using drugs tramping through the woods appears to say it's OK for kids. Wasted time and money.

  The worst was a husband and wife smoking daily weed. The husband says he has sore knees so he has ""LOL Medical Weed."" Wife says she has stress problems so she smokes ""LOL Medical Weed.""  Marijuana worsens both conditions so the couple is stuck in a drug nightmare.  The video does not correlate that Weed cuts off the oxygen to the injured areas of the body, increasing pain and slowing the healing process as it increases stress when the person is not drugged. This is why most medical marijuana cases for use are faked.

Pathetic attempt for advertising a solid issue. Doesn't hold water! Lacks clinical descriptions of the adverse effects. A missed opportunity for good information that is out there - but not here in this video.",1368057600,10,1055,4.737704918032787

4481844,5,B004V4RW8O,This DVD is used by several therapists to provide substance abuse counseling to juveniles who have been referred by DJJ.,1363996800,,120,5.05
4481845,4,B004V4RW8O,"I bought this DVD, not because I use drug. I bought it to use in teaching people the side effects of doing or using drugs. I work in a treatment facility, where emotional, physical illness are treated and Etoh use. I am very sure this DVD will go a long way to helping my clients/patients who are willing to work hard at changing their lives. Cocaine, Marijuana and Ecstasy is bad for the body, bad for the mind and most especially bad for the overall health of the society. I just bought this DVD ?( TODAY-01/31/2013), I hope to be able to come back here to give my final review after watching this video.",1359590400,,606,4.324561403508772
4481846,4,B004V4RW8O,"I teach a drug educational class and this documentary is perfect in length and material cover. It doesn't obviously go into Great detail for each drug, but definitely just enough for the participants to understand.",1358380800,,214,5.142857142857143
4481847,5,B004V4RW8O,The video has been an excellent addition to what I show my clients while they are in treatment.  They can see how their drug use has effected their brains and their bodiies.,1358035200,4,173,4.40625
4481848,4,B004V4RW8O,i work on a medical detox unit and found this DVD quite helpful in understanding better what happens to the brain and why people  become addicted.  I decided to donate this DVD to my unit to be used as an education part of our work with the patients.  Thank you for making this available.,1353369600,2,288,4.296296296296297
4481849,5,B004V4RW8O,I Teach high school health and love these National Geographic Videos for class because it shows kids the real life drugs and effects.,1353283200,2,133,4.826086956521739
4481850,5,B004V4RW8O,I've seen this video before and now use it to help teach AP classes because of all the body systems that drugs involve.  Great instruction tool.,1348531200,2,144,4.538461538461538
4481851,1,B004V4RW8O,"I am a therapist and for the past three years have run a intensive outpatient chemical dependency group. I am always looking for ways to break up our long therapy sessions and new ways to present information. I ordered this thinking that my teens would like a ""National Geographic"" made video on marijuana. I probably should have been more thorough in my reviewing of the video before purchasing it but I bought it because I wanted a video on marijuana and I just trusted National Geo blindly.

I must say that I was really disappointed. This video was non-stop clips of people getting high and talking about marijuana. The entire tone, in my opinion, was overly supportive of marijuana and glorified it's use. I tried to show certain clips but all my group reported that they ended up just feeling like they wanted to get high.

In summary, Video had some educational content but too ""laced"" with unneeded junk to be a usable video for me.",1339027200,26,940,4.656626506024097
4481852,2,B004V4RW8O,I thought there would be more visuals of how the drugs affect the body but all it seemed to show was people getting high and enjoying being stoned. I bought to do an educational group but felt tis video just would make the teens go out and get high more. Not what I expected at all so returned it.,1335916800,13,297,4.0508474576271185
4481853,3,B004V4RW8O,"I am a License Chemical Dependency Counselor and I had been looking for an educational video (talking about the effects on the body due to drugs). This video has a lot of great information however, it was poorly put together. What I mean is if you're recovering from substance abuse you don't need to see a lot of images of people smoking pot, crushing cocaine, snorting crack/cocaine, or popping pills. I wish they had left a lot of those images out therefore I wouldn't have had to pause-fast forward thru a lot of the scenes for my group. Other than that a lot of great info.",1335052800,22,578,4.462264150943396
