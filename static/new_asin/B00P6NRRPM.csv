8686553,5,B00P6NRRPM,"If you read the more critical reviews of this film in the Amazon (UK) listings, you will find that they are technically correct, but when you watch the film, you will not care  providing you have an interest in either the films made in the 1920s or in early 20th century naval warfare. I spotted two scenes where the armoured bulkheads were wobbling when actors brushed against them; but so what? Did you spot the rocks wobbling in The Last of the Mohicans during the final chase scene when Daniel Day Lewis brushed against them? Did that ruin the film for you, especially when they were obviously not filming in the correct geographical area?

Anyway; Like most people, my knowledge of these battles came from the book by Geoffrey Bennett from the Pan British Battles series in the 1960s, and there was a Radio 4 afternoon play about Admiral Craddock and his staff prior to the battle some years later.

I, too, had trouble accepting the ships used as equivalents for the originals, though there was at least one four-funneled cruiser shown but unfortunately it was playing Gneisenau. However, the story is what matters, and, despite a couple of light-relief scenes, which no doubt featured well-known entertainers of the day (my copy didn't come with the booklet, so I have no cast-list to check), it is as good as anything I have seen  of equal stature  from the period, excepting Abel Gances Napoleon, which was the Star Wars of its day. Unfortunately, its day was the same one that The Jazz Singer (or whatever it was called  my memory is starting to go) was released, and so it became a forgotten classic until fairly recently.

But, back to this film; I have seen some of the Russian classic films, restored and unrestored, and this is as good as any of those, without the Soviet propaganda; though there is a sort of propaganda here, but it is the stiff-upper lip sense of duty that British films of that and later periods tended to show, and the Germans are not shown as Evil Nazis.

This is a serious film about serious events, and we still watch The Battle of the River Plate even though it has got a (then) modern American cruiser playing the Graf Spee without anyone whingeing. This is probably best compared to Sink the Bismark!, though, in that it is black & white, and there are even fewer female characters in it.

Note also that the modern soundtrack is superb  it matches the on-screen action perfectly, and perfectly evokes the mood of the film. As the old saying has it  you cant see the join.",1518134400,2,2514,4.614349775784754
8686554,4,B00P6NRRPM,"Excellent restoration of a little known but very important sequence of two  Naval Battles between the Royal Navy and the Kriegsmarine  in the southern hemisphere, Coronel on 1 November and Falklands on 8 December 1914.  The legacy clips of gunnery are excellent. The production value for this 1927 silent film mirror the best of the art and production craft  as the silent era comes to a close with the release
of the Jazz Singer in October of 1927.  If you are a history aficanido and or a  fan of the ""Silents""  I recommend  Coronel & The Falklands  for your viewing pleasure.
