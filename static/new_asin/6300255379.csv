7807623,5,6300255379,"First, the previous reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about. I've owned this film for over two decades, and I can attest that both Ben Turpin & Buster Keaton are in this videotape. The Keaton footage is soley from ""Cops"", while there's several clips from Turpin's films.

Second, the whole film is excellent, if marred only by dated references (like comparing Jean Harlow to ""today's Marilyn Monroe""!) The film devotes a lot of screen-time to Laurel & Hardy, and deservedly so. I remember first watching this on PBS in the early 1980's, and I never laughed so hard in my life.",1180310400,5,582,4.762376237623762
7807624,2,6300255379,"I remember this movie from when I was a kid. I never laughed so hard in my life. It is not nearly as funny to me as it was then.  I remember a lot of other comedians being in the film (Ben Turpin, Buster Keaton, etc.) that have been cut out of this film. To me, that made the video a rip off because it had been edited down to leave them out.",1168819200,,342,3.684931506849315
