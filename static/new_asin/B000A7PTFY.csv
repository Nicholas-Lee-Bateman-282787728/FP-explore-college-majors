2378472,3,B000A7PTFY,"When WWIII breaks out and the nuclear bombs start falling, a naive, retired British couple cope by following the ridiculously inadequate precautions provided by their government, secure in the belief that their country will pull through just as it did in WWII.  The animation is very interesting and the story is moving at times, but it is simply too long.  It makes its point early on.  After that, I grew restless with the static location and frustrated with the main characters, who became less endearing and more irritating in their extreme inability to recognize what is happening around them.",1040428800,4,598,5.02020202020202
2378473,5,B000A7PTFY,"I'll admit, the only reason I checked out this movie was because the soundtrack was done by Roger Waters.  The people they got to play the main characters were amazing.  They pegged naive British folks to a tee.  Especially as they were nostaligizing about WWII in face of WWIII.  If you must see a movie about nuclear war and its effects, see this one.
My only complaint is that the Alphabet Song isn't on the soundtrack.",1038787200,15,422,4.5131578947368425
2378474,5,B000A7PTFY,"This is -not- a CD we're reviewing here, folks.  It's a movie that, at first, appears somewhat superficial: we're introduced to an elderly (""pensioners"") couple living in the backwoods of England.  When a nuclear attack occurs, they take their government's advice a bit too literally.  That's the rough-and-tumble summary, but what it really is is an introspective, ironic look at nuclear war, its propaganda, politics, and, finally, the ultimate cost.  One could, in a sense, compare it to Calvin and Hobbes: a comic strip drawn crudely, but whose characters address deep issues on a regular basis.  While the Cold War is over, this -- along with _The Day After_ -- is probably one of the best reminders of what it was like for those of us who lived through it, and a taste for those who were not yet aware of it.
I cannot recommend this film highly enough.  Sobering, thoughtful, and just terribly well done.",1038787200,28,910,4.801282051282051
2378475,5,B000A7PTFY,"I must have seen this film a hundred times since it's original release in 1986.  Every time I see it I am moved to tears, the only film that has ever done that to me.  There is nothing to fault this film.  The style of animation changes throughout to match the mood at the time, the music fits the images exactly (perfectly composed by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame).  The characters are so believable, everybody knows a couple just like them. The dialogue is perfection, sometimes you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  When the picture finishes I have to take a moment to compose myself each and every time.  Everybody should be made to watch this film at least once in their lives.",1012521600,9,688,4.420634920634921

2378480,5,B000A7PTFY,"You have to be in the right frame of mind to watch this. I had originally rented it years ago (VHS), and waited to be able to get my hands on a copy later in life. Well, now I have it, and I could only bring myself to watch it once. It's beautifully done (hard to say that about a lot of animation), and can be humorous, at times. However, when the entire subject matter is considered, there is a real sadness to it.
Yes, I recommend it. It's in a class by itself. Just don't think that it's a ""feel good"" movie going into it...",1458259200,,528,3.990566037735849
2378481,4,B000A7PTFY,"This was one of my first encounters with adult animation, with my brother renting it from our local Camelot Music.  I think it gave me nightmares.

The movie is basically a satirical take on England's reccomendations for preparedness for nuclear war.  On the surface, it seems like a relic from the cold war era, but its themes could easily apply to our modern era and how we are ""prepared"" for an attack.

The story follows a retired couple trying to dutifly follow preparations for a nuclear attack from pamphlets they were really published in Britain.  They follow the ridiculous suggestions, survive, and then live in a certain delusion that everything will be okay, basically suggesting how ill prepared we actually are for an attack should it happen.

The overall story is well told, but VERY British, so buyer take heed.  Most of the dialogue is on point and the voice work is fantastic, though some of the dialogue can carry on a bit long.  But it kind of makes sense, as these two people just have each other, so what else are they going to do.

The animation is simple but unique, mixing simple cell based animation for foreground characters, realistic backgrounds, and just a bit of live action.

The music is great, particularly David Bowies title song and Roger Waters score/songs.  The soundtrack is worth seeking out.

Overall, this is worth a look.  In a way, it's kind of scary.  Short of a horror movie, this is one of the most isolated movie's I've seen.  It's also very bleak.  If you step back and view it as satire, it's a little bit more bearable, but keep in mind that thos film can at times seem very hopeless.

This along with another animated film, ""the Grave of the Fireflies,"" are two of the best antiwar movies I've seen.  It's amazing the kinds of emotions you can communicate with animation.",1453593600,,1823,4.661442006269592

2378486,5,B000A7PTFY,"I first read the Graphic Novel in the late 80's when I purchased it from a Used Bookseller and then I was fortunate!! enough to have come across a dubbed (pirated) DVD (I didn't know until I had it home) of the coveted scratch-less variety. I've enjoyed it immensely but the Quality of my bad copy is poor and grainy; of course, that could be due to my viewing it once or three times a week.
Children from the Ages of 10-18 should be shown this Film in the due Course of their History Lessons. Yes, James and Hilda are the Archetype stodgy British couple who remembered the Second World War as a child does, and they are completely out of their element when the ""big Bangs"" over take them.
It was brought up quite obviously after the bomb had gone off when the Old Folks were going to bed -- there in the distance, silhouetted out the window were all the fires and ""radiation"" still glowing. It takes a bit of looking for but it will be there.
The graphic novel and the film should be taught side by side Current Events as to consider the so-called Doomsday ""awareness"" being flashed on almost every channel. Which will it be? Doomsday castles or bug-out tunnels or more likely millions of people sitting up wondering ""What? that was Today???""",1384387200,,1243,4.456140350877193
2378487,3,B000A7PTFY,"Bought this movie and the book because I'm always interested to see how other people in different countries think how a nuke war effects them. It's about an elderly couple who went thru WW 2, their memories of it and then the husband using government phamplets to prep just before the bombs start falling. After the bombs fall, the couple basically just stand around with their thumbs up their behinds waiting for the government to help/restore things back to what it used to be. Their mind set seems to be set in thinking if/when the nukes fall, it won't be much more different than what they went thru the Blitz/attacks on England by Germany during WW 2. I'll be keeping this as it is something different, but the book is going to the used book store.",1370736000,,753,4.544117647058823

2378491,4,B000A7PTFY,"I know some people will not be happy with me pointing out some of the flaws of this movie, but I feel that in any honest review, they must be pointed out along with the good.

I agree that the tone of the movie (as well as the graphic novel it is based on) is a bit manipulative and heavy-handed at times. Did we really need Jim and Hilda to to be so... well... stupid and ignorant? See, the real reason they are is because if the two of them are not dumb sheeples, but an intelligent and resourceful couple that would likely have fared far better off, and even have had hope in an otherwise very bleak setting. The idea of hope and survival, even an extremely harsh and bitter one, goes against the theme of portraying the supposed utter hopelessness and futility of nuclear war.

The other reason behind this, I imagine, is because the author wants to show perhaps how difficult understanding the survival pamphlets of the time were. In fact, the name of the movie is drawn right from the opening introductory paragraphs of the ""Protect and Survive"" pamphlet:

""If nuclear weapons are used on a large scale, those of us living in the country areas might be exposed to as great a risk as those in the towns. The radioactive dust, falling *where the wind blows* it, will bring the most widespread dangers of all.""

Several sites archive it, and you see that Jim's inability to read the pamphlet shows something is very wrong as I had little in the way of difficulty comprehending the material. In fact, Jim's difficulty makes me wonder if he is going into senility as he keeps forgetting key points, and becomes easily confused with little provocation. In both the movie and graphic novel, Jim's claims that the material does not tell you what you should be looking for in the way of fallout, yet I found that it does, in the first chapter titled ""Challenge to survival"", indicating that Jim's perhaps lacks distinct comprehension skills. The pamphlet even goes in fair detail on the effects of heat and blast damage, and provides simple, but effective graphic illustrations.

Maybe poor Jim is reading an older version of the pamphlet?

Indeed, later on the booklet gives additional detailed illustrations as well as written instruction in how to build the inner fallout shelter. Furthermore, and compounding just how poor Jim's comprehension ability is, the material even says that you should use a basement, or a closet under the stairs.... both of which his house has! We only get a glimpse of Jim and Hilda's basement, but it seemed fairly roomy, and looked like it would have been a perfect place to stay for weeks on end. In fact, there are many other things listed in the survival guidebook that he did not heed at all.

Speaking of weeks, the pamphlet clearly states that one needs to stay in the shelter at up to fourteen days. The fact that Jim's completely forgets this and in confusion can't remember if it is four or fourteen is quite amazing, especially since he had the booklet on hand to look it up!

So, that again emphasizes the previously mentioned flaw of the movie and novel: that old and stupid people will perish. I know that's not a message the story is trying to get across, but that IS one possible interpretation. If the couple had been smarter, a little bit better equipped, and not so easily confused or so blatantly ignorant, they might very well have survived just fine. It is also possible that compounding everything, Jim and Hilda are also suffering the neurological effects of heavy radiation poisoning as well.

I also certainly would have cut out the opening live-action scene as it added little to the movie, and only served to unnecessarily draw out the running time.

Even still, despite those flaws and more, the movie and novel still stand up, and the animation is rather remarkable, very different than what people in the U.S. are used to with Disney, Warner Bros, and Japanese anime styles. What struck me was the clever use of live action and multi-planning to create an amazing ""three dimensional"" effect in various scenes. Very effective. More so than some modern CGI 3-D effects in some ways.

So keeping the flaws in mind, especially as they are largely a product of the time the movie and novel were made, the pathos and detail on the effects of nuclear war make this a great entry in the list of similar movies about what would happen in a full-out nuclear attack.",1313193600,5,4416,4.65596919127086

2378494,5,B000A7PTFY,"This is without a doubt an animated film that ranks right up there with ""The Iron Giant"", a film that deserves more than just a DVD-R release. The story is both frightening and heartwarming, a timeless tale of love and loss in a post nuclear Holocaust world. This movie has never received the respect it deserves, and yet with one viewing those who do see this film are never left with a bad taste in there mouths. It may not have the budget of a Disney film but it makes you care about the two main characters far more than any Disney film ever could. Well written and well worth the viewers time.",1285200000,6,598,4.300884955752212
2378495,1,B000A7PTFY,"The script seems designed to teach ignorant morons that nuclear war would be awful, as if we all didn't know this already. In its effort to state the obvious, the movie has no surprises, no interesting twists, no plot development, no complicating factors, and no interesting characters. In fact, the characters are entirely flat, and remain witless throughout the entirety of the movie.

The movie relies entirely on the characters making statements out of ignorance which, in fact, are ironically true. If the movie had some interesting plot elements, then maybe the movie would not have been so boring. As it stands, I and the other two watching the movie were ready for it to be over in the first 20-30 minutes. Black comedic elements produced only two or three chuckles in my house.

We endured this flat movie to the end purely out of a devoted interest in Roger Waters' music, but there was not enough in it to justify this waste of time.

We walked away from the movie knowing nothing more about life than we did before we watched it. Actually, there was one thing which we got from the movie: despite the naivet of the husband and wife in the movie, they nonetheless loved each other and were devoted to each other, and this is significant even in a holocaust when all else is lost. But this certainly was not a point which the movie producer wished to convey, and he would no doubt mock me for thinking such.",1271635200,6,1417,4.592885375494071
