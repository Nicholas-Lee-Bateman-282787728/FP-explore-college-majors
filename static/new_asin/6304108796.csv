7861720,3,6304108796,"Well, I'm a George Kennedy fan, but this movie has several flaws, beginning with his co-stars; a kid who can't act and a skinny actress who doesn't look at all like she belongs on a farm, skin tight jeans, hair and makeup perfect, not mention being 20 yrs younger than Kennedy's character. The dialogue was a bit dumb, too. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. If you love George Kennedy, you'll be better off buying 'Cool Hand Luke' or the first 'Airport' movie.",1517875200,,459,4.609756097560975

7861725,4,6304108796,"I remember watching this movie many many years ago and thought it was pretty good then.  That was through the eyes of a child.  Now as an adult, sure, it is dated, but it still has an appeal.  The scenery, the story and plot are all good.  You can tell it was a made for tv movie, as it has pauses everywhere a commercial should be.  George Kennedy does very well in his role and I remember thinking as a kid I'd love to have a father like him.  It's an easy movie to watch, not too emotional or suspenseful, but just a clean, good story.",1398556800,,538,4.028301886792453

7861728,4,6304108796,"I remembered seeing this little flick on the tube when it came out.  Features George Kennedy with the annoying kid from the movie Ben.  Somewhat predictable plot and obviously made for tv, but still decent entertainment for 90 minutes.",1255910400,,235,5.0
7861729,2,6304108796,"This is a hokey, dated, low-budget quasi-drama which crumbles despite a potentially interesting premise:  a possibly rabid man ties himself to a post.  Unfortunately, high jinx ensue, and whatever drama could have  existed is obscured by child anti-star Gus' stereotypically bad acting and  shaggy (anti)haircut.  My favorite scenes are when Gus brings blankets (for  no apparent reason) and gets socked in the kisser.  The hallucinatory scene  where the guy gets attacked by a Davy Crockett hat takes the cake though.  Truly one of the funniest bits ever captured on film.  Inconsequential  sideplots abound, naturally... and what a conclusion!",958003200,4,645,5.479591836734694
