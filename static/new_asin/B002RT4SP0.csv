Directed by Joseph Kuo (the man behind classics such as 7 Grandmasters, Mystery of Chessboxing, Born Invincible,18 Bronzemen & many others), the film revolves around the Shaolin Temple obviously & their giving safe haven to a princess that the Manchus are trying to capture led by the indomitable Chang Shan. While many of the disciples are hardly recognizable in other films, a couple of the abbots include Mark Long & Chai Kai. Mark Long plays an important part in this & has a connection with Chang Shan prior to his life as a monk. There is a bit of comedy, but not too much though. And of course, there's the grand finale where everyone is getting their martial arts on in a fight to the finish.

The young man who is sort of the lead handles himself well enough with his skills. The standouts in this are of course Chang Shan & Mark Long who looks about as good as I've ever seen him on screen. Chai Kai has a brief showdown & looks good in the process. Overall, I heard this one talked about by those deep in the culture & I'm glad I finally got an opportunity to watch it. Old school heads, if you have not got around to viewing this one please do so immediately! You won't be disappointed...",1494288000,,1300,4.327868852459017
