8340557,3,B001T4Y27S,"This was a decent documentary from an outside perspective.  Unfortunately, none of the current band members did any interviews or explained what was going on in certain situations.  Very little of their music was used throughout the DVD.  Otherwise it was well put together.",1316390400,,274,5.181818181818182
8340558,1,B001T4Y27S,"I love the Killers and was extremely disappointed by this DVD. The DVD is ""unauthorized"" and contains no interviews with the actual band, no Killers songs and no footage of the band. It is just a bunch of general interviews with acquaintances and people on the Las Vegas music scene. It contains zero information or insight about the band. The first 20 minutes are a detailed overview of the Las Vegas music scene, without even mention of the Killers. It is long, boring and an attempt by some third party to make money off the band. Killers fans don't bother with this!",1200787200,10,570,4.598039215686274
8340559,1,B001T4Y27S,"No Music, All Talk! If anyone is interested in the tiny details of The Killers, like what the band eats for breakfast, this DVD is for you. I'm immediately donating my copy to Goodwill.",1200614400,4,185,4.470588235294118
8340560,4,B001T4Y27S,"I must disagree with the reviewer below/above - he's correct that this is not authorized by the band [and it's an English production, where they spell this word with an s, not a z, so this is hardly as 'typo']but the interviews on it also include early members of the group, the band's first manager and a whole lot of others who know/knew the band in the early days. It's far more illunminating than either of the biographies out there, at least these people have spoken to friends/associates etc instead of just putting together a cut and paste production. As good as anything you'd see on VH1, if you're a fan i would suggest you'll enjoy it.",1198627200,2,645,4.521367521367521
8340561,1,B001T4Y27S,"Not a good DVD at all. This DVD is not backed by the record label so it contains none of the Killers music ( live or recorded ). they weren't even able to use the font in which the killers is written in. It is a very low budget documentary with other bands music in the background and typos on the cover ( spelling unauthorised as unathorised ). don't get this DVD expecting anything direct from the band. its full of club owners, old friends and radio station djs talking about when they first came into contact with the killers.",1198540800,21,530,4.31
