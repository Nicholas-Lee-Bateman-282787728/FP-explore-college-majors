8436174,4,B004MP96O0,"As with the first season set, the show itself is 5 stars, unfortunately, the English subtitles are, again, only about 80% accurate. Among the 20% with issues are bad grammar, misspellings, translation errors and a few missed lines. Also, during flashback scenes, there is often a different translation of the same lines. Regardless, you can still understand what is supposed to be said. Sadly, the group doing the subtitles put their name on screen every 5-10 minutes, annoying. It was obviously produced in Taiwan for sale there, Malaysia, China, etc... so English isn't as critical to them, although I wish they had better quality control on the subtitle work. I have the original anime series and really enjoyed this live action adaptation as well. All that being said, if you love this show, it's worth adding to your collection in spite of the English subtitle issues since I haven't ever seen any licensed for release specifically in the US.",1492992000,,947,4.962264150943396

8436178,5,B004MP96O0,Ratings are the same as part one. I Would recommend it highly to every one. Loved the alternate ending for this series,1396828800,,118,4.409090909090909
8436179,5,B004MP96O0,"If you have Part 1 then you need to see the rest of the story.  The DVD arrive quickly and in good condition.  I liked Part 1 so I have to see how it ends.  I think it's a good production of this Manga.  I like that main girl is not so helpless like the Korean version though I think Lee Min Ho is good looking.  This story made sense more than the Korean one.  I was not sure why the mom who was dead set on not having her son marry the main girl suddenly disappeared from the storyline in the Korean version.  This production explains things better or was just written better so the story makes more sense.  I don't want to give away what happens so you need to watch and see what I mean.  When I read reviews of the Korean version they said that they stopped production but the ending was not enough or didn't close the story well so they did more filming.  Maybe that's why it ends seemingly unfinished.  I watched the Korean version because I like LMH and KHJ and didn't think these guys were that cute (I know shallow) but after my cousin told me I'd like this version's story and the characters I watched Part 1 online and liked it so much I bought the DVD for both Parts 1 and 2.  This is not for young kids though there is no nudity or graphic violence at all.  There's bullying maybe at the level of the movie ""Mean Girls"" and fighting (punching vs. MMA).",1382400000,2,1365,4.125

1. subtitles are atrocious; they make little sense
2. DVDs don't stay locked in their spaces, so they fall out whenever the pack is moved",1360713600,3,153,4.703703703703703

8436182,4,B004MP96O0,"This is a continuation of Hana Yori Dango, and as other reviewers have pointed out, the English subtitles are of better quality in this season. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.

The story continues with the two leads having been separated for nearly a year. Doumyoji's mother has sent him to New York,  while Makino remains in Japan. Eventually, she tracks him down, determined to find out how he really feels about her. But what she doesn't know is that his family's company is going bankrupt...

There are subplots involving an arranged marriage, amnesia, and of course, a love triangle (Doumyoji's best friend, Rui, also likes Makino). The love triangle is handled more satisfactorily than in the Korean remake (where I actually rooted for the girl to end up with the second lead).

If you liked  Season 1, you'll probably like this season even more. It is lighter in tone, the characters seem a little more grown up, and it has a happy ending.

I found the stereotypes of Americans in the New York scenes to be a little off putting. Now I know how people from other countries must feel when they watch American movies...",1339891200,3,1114,4.658163265306122
