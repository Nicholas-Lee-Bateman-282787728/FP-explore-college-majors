2749939,3,B000MV8C3E,"Review of Shout Praises Kids: Every Move I Make
Like the music. Videos are strange. Other versions of the series videos are better.",1371772800,2,131,4.739130434782608
2749940,5,B000MV8C3E,"We love this Music DVD...
Our most favorite song is ""Every move you make""
The little kids go nuts when this song comes on & they request it alot.",1368057600,5,145,4.0344827586206895
2749941,3,B000MV8C3E,"Used this one week for VBS. Kids really liked it. Got them moving and singing! Well worth the cost. I'm sure there are others that might be better, but for what we needed, it worked well.",1361577600,2,187,4.222222222222222
2749942,5,B000MV8C3E,Our kiddos love the songs and the graphics on this dvd.  We use these dvd's for our family worship times a few nights a week which allows the older ones to engage in worship and the younger ones have something to keep their attention.  It's better than just having a cd playing.,1337126400,6,278,4.326923076923077
2749943,5,B000MV8C3E,"One song is the reason for the video purchase.  My daughter loves the ""Every Move I Make"" video and calls it ""shoes"".  The other songs/videos do not entertain my toddler.

2011 Update..  As she has grown so has her love for this video and all the songs..",1241136000,,254,4.340425531914893
2749944,4,B000MV8C3E,"We love popping in this DVD for an instant praise party at our house. It has come of our favorite tracks from Contemporary Christian music.  My kids love seeing a ""video"" for the songs they hear at church or listen to on the radio and sing at the top of their lungs.  The colors and dancers keep the younger ones engaged while the bouncing ball helps the older ones with word recognition.  The best part is that we can have fun singing praises to God!",1239148800,2,451,4.2823529411764705
2749945,4,B000MV8C3E,"Great music, and dvd.  But it's too much stimulation (lots of flashing and blinking) for my 2 year old, so we just play the music, and shut off the video portion.  Otherwise, if you have a group of toddlers at a party, this might be appropriate.",1237939200,2,245,4.304347826086956

8172589,2,B000MV8C3E,"Love the songs, but was disappointed that only two songs and kids doing the movements along with the songs.  Was going to take it to my pre school worship class, but this will not work.",1484006400,5,185,4.285714285714286
8172590,5,B000MV8C3E,I liked this well enough. It only has 2 really upbeat fun dancy songs the others are mellow. The kids would almost rather watch the pretty videos it goes with than dance to the music,1482364800,2,182,4.228571428571429
8172591,5,B000MV8C3E,I've been looking for this for weeks.  So glad I found it.,1477872000,,58,3.8333333333333335
8172592,1,B000MV8C3E,The kids liked one song. So did I. I wanted the hand motions to go with it for praised worship. I won't be buying another one. I gave it one star just not to be rude,1461456000,,165,3.611111111111111
8172593,5,B000MV8C3E,Lots of wonderful praise songs!,1457049600,,31,5.4
