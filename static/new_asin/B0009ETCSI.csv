2284900,5,B0009ETCSI,I was anxious to purchase this dvd as I had planned this same train ride but had to abandon it due to an emergency.  So I was really excited to purchase the dvd and it did not disappoint.  It covered the cities well & I felt as though I was actually on the train.  The photography was superb.,1267574400,26,292,4.0

2284929,5,B0009ETCSI,"Dear friends,
  one of my travel dreams is to take the train ride covered in this DVD. Until I get to actually do it, this DVD will keep me happy and informed of what I will someday see in reality.

2284937,2,B0009ETCSI,"Very disappointed! DO NOT EXPECT A SCENIC FILM! It seems this dvd was released in 1992 but the film was likely made in 1960, but this is not type of vintage film to be enjoyed. It is more like a documentary made for middle school Geography class. It truly undermines your intelligence= what a porter does, who sits in the dining car, etc! This film focuses on the stops in the main cities, featuring its hotels and malls of all things. The only nice views along this route is towards the end when the train reaches Albertas Lake Louise and Bamfs majestic mountains. Other than that you will not see anything impressive and will learn very little about each locale. Not worth your time.",1365120000,,685,4.532258064516129
2284938,4,B0009ETCSI,"The filming and narration were very good on this video.  We visited the western side of Canada but won't be able to travel to the middle or eastern side, so this gave us a good idea of the beautiful sights that Canada has to offer.",1363564800,,231,4.133333333333334
2284939,4,B0009ETCSI,"It is impressive that one man, Doug Jones, filmed, wrote, and narrated this informative video.
It's slightly dated (akin to a colourful Kodak-like feel) but I found that this added to the charm of the video.
Mr. Jones gives insightful information (of both locale and its history) for the major stops of The Canadian train. He speaks respectfully of the history of each stop and what each stop has to offer tourists.
Mr. Jones's video definitely makes you want to take this train from Toronto to Vancouver and stay in the great turn-of-the-century railroad hotels!
My only complaint is that I wish the video lingered on the beauty/architecture of these old railroad hotels. I also wish the train itself was a bit more beautiful -- it looks rather ordinary by modern standards -- I wish it looked more deluxe because I think this is what the modern traveler is now looking for: great service and a unique, retro experience!
Pleasant video that was easy to watch.",1362182400,7,960,4.789156626506024
2284940,2,B0009ETCSI,Very outdated and boring to sit through.  Looks to be early 70's style and gives very dry blah narrative.  Almost no actual scenes from the train.,1360886400,,146,4.576923076923077
2284941,5,B0009ETCSI,The Great Canadian Train Ride was wonderful. The scenery spectacular and narration beyond compare. It was shown as an armchair travelogue at a Retirement Village with rave reviews following the show. A great presentation!,1360195200,5,221,5.529411764705882
2284942,3,B0009ETCSI,"I was interested to see the train, and views from the train.  There should be a lot of beautiful terrain on this trip.

Other than that it's entertaining and for everybody who cannot afford to spend $ 12.000 for a week in a sleeper car going from coast to coast this is a nice alternative.",1507334400,,415,4.473684210526316

8059796,3,B0009ETCSI,"A strong three stars, perhaps a four star release if you are massively into railway history...

Basically what we have here is an 80 minute presentation on the train called the 'Canadian'. The DVD effectively takes you along on a journey from one side of the nation to the other (roughly). As it does so it takes the opportunity to show you the features of the train and what life is like aboard it for the number of days it takes to make the journey. The story of the building of the railway comes out during this as does a lot of the main places such a trip stops at. There is some time given not only to the sort of adventures you can have in the various cities but also the sorts of grand old railway industry hotels that still existed at the time of this release being filmed.

And that's sort of the rub. From what I could tell - and I'm no tech person when it comes to this sort of thing - this release seems to have been a transfer from an old VHS release and you sure can tell it from the sharpness (or complete lack thereof) of the images. Which is doubly tragic because in between talking about the train and its resurrection and the beautiful hotels you can stay in along the way there are sections of this DVD that show the beautiful Canadian countryside. Now firstly these parts should have been front and centre for the release rather than shots of people dressed up to the nines having 'high tea' in some ridiculously dated hotel but secondly the poor transfer has robbed so much of the beauty from the shots the original cameraman (if he is still alive) would hang his head and weep if he saw it. Very sad all round.

Having said that there is a certain charm in the decisively understated narration. But without a presenter to lead you through the journey the whole thing is a bit lacking. There are shots of engineers and conductors etc. yet nothing to help you engage with them. There is no interviews with these people about their jobs and in fact no real handle for the viewer to grip.

For those with a deep interest in rail travel or Canada (or both) this is probably worth a look if you can get it very cheap.",1487289600,,2134,4.287841191066997
