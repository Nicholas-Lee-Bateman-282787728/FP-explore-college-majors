7869236,4,6304346085,Take it for what it is a good low budget B-movie and enjoy. If it's that bad as some reviews reflect why is it coming out on Blu-ray? To each his own and I\I'll buy the blu ray in March.,1421712000,,186,3.675
7869237,2,6304346085,"""Exterminators of the Year 3000 (1983)"" is an Italian thievery of 80's movies such as ""Escape from New York,"" and the ""Road Warrior"", but I'm not even mad since there's enough unintentional comedy to satisfy all Mad Max fans.

One of the greatest terrible movies of all time! It's the end of the world and the post apocalyptic world bad guys have eye liner and an endless supply of water carts and big claws that stick out of their pants.

Maybe it's a gem if you're a fan of low-budget, poorly-acted, Mad Max rip offs.",1382572800,,519,4.4526315789473685
7869238,4,6304346085,"1983's ""Exterminators of the Year 3000"" was released at the height of the wave of post-apocalyptic films to come out of Italy in the early '80s and is itself a minor classic of the genre, which also included the likes of ""2020 Texas Gladiators"" and ""Warriors of the Wasteland.""  The writers of ""Exterminators"" included Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sachetti, who were among the ""A"" list of Italian exploitation filmmakers of the day, as their other credits included such works as ""Zombie"" and ""1990: the Bronx Warriors.""

The title places us in the year 3000, when the earth has become a barren wasteland frighteningly devoid of something we all need to live on, water.  A colony of good, upright citizens, including a young boy named Tommy (Luca Venantini), know where an underground spring is located to supply the people and further civilization.  A search party is sent out across the desert to intercept the water.  Along the way, Tommy encounters a lone drifter named Alien (Robert Iannucci) with a nifty car (the Exterminator), and yet their progress is stunted by a gang of marauding bandits intent on hijacking the water for themselves and pretty much killing everyone they find in their path.

I remember seeing this one on TV as a kid at like three in the morning sometime in the mid-'80s.  It has up until now been unavailable on DVD.  I probably hadn't seen it in as long and I'm happy to report it holds up pretty well.  There are car chases, explosions, and dead bodies galore, and yet it also has a ""heart"" rarely found in a film genre like this.  The camaraderie that develops between Alien and Tommy is quite endearing.  Also, they are aided by a maverick female renegade named Trash (played by Alicia Moro) who also happens to be a total babe beneath the tough exterior, if you ask me.  Alicia's beauty keeps my eyes transfixed on the screen every time I watch this and is a definite plus.  I also love the vintage cheesy synthesizer music that carries the picture and befits this period of low budget films.  Finally, I'm so glad that Code Red decided to keep the original movie poster from the original Thorn-Emi VHS release for the DVD cover art.  It looked cool to me as a kid in the '80s thumbing through the titles in our local mom and pop video store (remember those?) and still does today.

All in all, seeing this one again after all these years brought me back to childhood, when futuristic movies like this were all the rage.  Recommended for fans of quality Italian post-nuke action flicks.",1289520000,5,2518,4.673469387755102
7869239,3,6304346085,"Survivors of a nuclear holocaust living in an underground cave are faced with certain death after their precious supply of water begins to run out. It's the year 3000 and water has become the new gold for those fortunate to have some. The survivors have sent out another search team to find an untapped well located on a map. The last person they sent out never came back and the remaining survivors are running out of time. The biggest problem for the search team is they'll have to pass through a dangerous desert wasteland controlled by 'Crazy Bull' and his band of barbaric motorcyclists and it won't be easy. Can the survivors find the well in time? Will they get help from an unlikely hero? You'll have to buy your own copy to find out.

Have you ever wondered what ""Exterminators of the Year 3000"" would look like completely restored and remastered with an amazing picture and sound, for those of you interested; you'll have to keep wondering a little longer. One look at the Disc packaging and disc artwork for ""Exterminators of the Year 3000"" from Code Red and you'll think you're in for a real treat and that's definitely not the case. The slip cover artwork is so good that this movie looks like it belongs in the Post Apocalyptic set from Media Blasters but it clearly doesn't. It's really too bad Media Blasters didn't release this DVD.

The full frame video image from Code Red looks like it was transferred directly from a worn out VHS copy complete with speckling, lines and debris. The colors are anything but vibrant as they seem really faded and the picture appears washed out throughout most of the film. The sound is English mono and it's really weak and inconsistent throughout the movie as well. The volume level is so low I had to play it on my home theater system just so I could hear it. This DVD is definitely over priced and fans of this film will probably be disappointed in what they see and hear. I would suggest renting this DVD before buying if possible to see what you're getting in terms of picture and sound quality.

7869240,1,6304346085,"My brother and I rented this movie years ago.  I thought it would be fun.  I kept watching it in hopes of finding something to justify my time.  It kept getting more and more stupid and pointless.  I watched it to see how stupid stupid could be.  It was exceptionally bad.  I maintain that all coppies of this movie should be gathered together, put in a pile in a vacant field and burned.  The ashes should then be salted so that nothing could ever grow there again.  Perhaps that would be too extreme but I rather disliked the movie.  I also talked to the video store manager for several minutes about how bad it was.  There is an hour or two of my life I wish I had back.  If you like this type of movie perhaps you would like it.  It just is not my thing.",1284768000,,758,4.081632653061225

7869242,1,6304346085,"The Italians made tons of MAD MAX rip-offs, and this is one of the most worthless. I guess 2020 TEXAS GLADIATORS spoiled me, being one of the most violent and depraved films I've ever seen. I was expecting more, and there's not even any gore (just a little blood). This one is mostly talk and car chases, with a group of humans searching for uncontaminated water in the post-nuke future, dealing with biker gangs, and as the video box proclaims, ""horribly scarred nuclear mutants!"" You only see one mutant, for a split second, and it just looks like a guy with Silly Putty stuck to his face. The same biker gang pops up again and again, and the leader refers to everyone as ""mothergrabbers."" It's pretty boring for the most part, and the extremely weak ending renders the entire movie pointless, literally.",1090454400,3,806,4.683098591549296
7869243,2,6304346085,"Mad Max is the inspiration for this film as the characters drive around in souped up cars with extra bits stuck on them.  It's no worse or better than other films of it's genre and there are some exciting moments.  The stunts  are good, but you'd have to be prepared to sit through dubbed dialogue,  so-so acting and dull music.  One for the collectors.",954892800,,353,4.453125
