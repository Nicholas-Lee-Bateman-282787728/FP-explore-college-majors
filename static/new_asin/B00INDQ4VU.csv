6282586,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Susie makes exercising fun and effective!
She is knowledgeable . Her workouts are anti-aging!
Resistance bands have been proven to help prevent osteoporosis.",1397001600,4,157,5.869565217391305
6282587,5,B00INDQ4VU,"This DVD will be the most valuable (maybe after your toothbrush and underwear) article you pack on your next trip. Susie's clear, helpful, and engaging instructions make her bands classes both enjoyable and a real workout; her DVD promises to do the same thing when you're away from the gym or home.

 I suffered 2 fractured vertebrae in a cycling accident and was worried that it would sideline my ability to ride. Fortunately, Susie's strength training class- and now her DVDs- have given me back my health, and allowed me to cycle without pain. And, thanks to her, I'm stronger now than I was when I had the accident 7 years ago.",1397001600,10,632,4.633928571428571
6282588,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Though I haven't technically recorded my bone density levels, I am the ""older"" than boomer generation, and I am amazed at how quickly I have improved in muscle tone, flexibility of my whole body, well-being in movement, greater strength in lifting and pulling.  My clothes fit better, I have more energy, and it has been easy and engaging--I do Susie's exercises two times per week only!  I have done a lot of yoga and hiking and bicycling, but these two hours per week have brought results more quickly than anything else.  I've only done this program for 10 weeks in all!

6282589,5,B00INDQ4VU,"I am so excited that this DVD will be released on Amazon in early April. I got a review copy and wow! This is sooooooooooo simple and yet, I got a great workout. Last week, my fitness trainer said I need to do weight training to prevent osteoporosis (I am 46). It's inconvenient for me to drive to the fitness center, so I just do the DVD at home. I have a stomach problem that makes it difficult for me to get on and up from the floor --- this DVD doesn't make me get down on the ground! Also, I didn't have to find a place to attach the resistance band to a door or railing. All my door knobs are lever style, so attaching a band would open the door. So looking forward to my next workout -- I only have to do two a week, so this is EASY!",1396310400,5,740,3.875
6282590,5,B00INDQ4VU,"This is a marvelous antidote to the sit, sit, sitting of travel. Also, its helps maintain the gains one has worked-out for. Its so easy to tuck the bands into any suitcase and usually easy to find space to use them even in a hotel room.",1394323200,4,236,4.1521739130434785

6282592,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Love, love, love this DVD! Susie Hathaway is a great instructor. She gives clear instruction with demonstrations of every movement. I also love that she does stretches in between every single exercise which has helped me immensely in preventing stiffness afterwards. Along with  showing the proper form/posture for each exercise, she also demonstrates what NOT to do to prevent injury, especially to those with bone loss. This video proves that even small movements are very effective in strengthening both your bones and muscles. Highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to strengthen their bones!",1496448000,2,603,5.347368421052631

I'm by no means a professional in this area but I do have a pretty good grasp of what's out there and I think Susie Hathaway's programs are second to none.  I've ordered the ""Resistance Band Training..."" DVD for myself and have requested my public library to order her ""Safe Strength Training for Osteoporosis Prevention"" for their collection.  These are packed with information, safety tips, and an excellent teaching style and awareness of form.  As a bonus, Susie is very proactive and concerned about those of us who purchase her videos.  She contacted me via email with several recommendations and bits of wisdom...and an invitation to get ahold of her any time if I have questions.  This DVD--and Susie--get an A+++ from me!",1474588800,2,843,4.985714285714286

How to return digital for refund?  No idea - only info about how to buy/rent more digital is available

The video itself and Susie are great, as it was in the weights video.  Hi Susie!  Thank you for telling + showing me how to make my bones strong and for working out with me!  Fun video and well-done like the last one.  Now I see you 2 times a week, alternating workouts, so fun.

I'm buying the DVD hard copy, as this digital version doesn't work for me (I tried digital and I hated, lol)

If you are looking for fun, effective, safe, bone-strengthening workouts filled with encouragement and helpful information, buy this DVD and Susie's strength training with weights DVD.  She is a motivating, knowledgeable, and bubbly instructor.  The workouts will strengthen you and your bones, over time because you'll use stronger resistance bands and/or weights as your body improves.  The workouts are nicely produced - sound and video quality are great, instructions and pacing are excellent, etc.

I struggled to find bone strengthening videos that are challenging, fun, and uplifting - and am thrilled to add this second excellent, complimentary workout of Susie's to my rotation.

Cheers!",1446595200,5,1475,4.934959349593496

6282627,5,B00INDQ4VU,"With a 30-year history fibromyalgia and ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), I started Susie's class only after hearing rave reviews of it from a number of people after we moved to where Susi teaches and lives.  In her ""live"" class, she uses a combination of free weights and bands (and sells a DVD for each option).  I talked to her beforehand about my long history of negative effects and injuries from other exercise programs, and her suggestions to do fewer repetitions of each exercise and stop anytime in the session that I feel I need to have allowed me to continue with her classes twice a week for 2 months without any negative effects.  I sometimes use one pound weights or the lightest band with the exercises, but often just moving my limbs through the exercise is enough for me and avoids post-exercise worsening of symptoms.  The other way that I modify her exercises is to NOT strive to to the maximum repetitions or weights that I'm capable of at the time.  Anyway, I've noticed a steady increase in strength since two weeks into the program (4 sessions), and I'm also noticing that I'm sometimes able now to do the same number of repetitions that other people are doing (although with no weight or band).  Susie always does brief stretching with whatever muscle groups were exercised in the previous several forms, and I think this helps me not to set off muscle spasms.  I highly recommend people with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue try her program (either with weights or bands) and decrease the length and intensity of each exercise and the biweekly sessions - it's really helped me gain strength more than anything I've found.

6282628,5,B00INDQ4VU,Great training workout.  Easy to follow and options for more or less intense moves.,1415059200,,83,4.928571428571429
6282629,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Susie Hathaways strength training program has made a huge difference in how well I feel. I started her program almost six years ago, after breaking my wrist in a minor fall and then learning that I had osteoporosis.  I started doing Susie's program for my bones, but I feel physically better now in every way. Im stronger today than I was six years ago, Im healthier, Im more flexible, I stand straighter without effort, and my balance is much improved.

I used to fall a lot, but after taking up Susies strength training, the falling virtually went away. I did, however, have a fall last winter and hurt my other wrist. I went to my doctor, who looked at it and said it would get better by itself. I remarked that I didn't like having it sore, because I have been doing wrist curls with 15 pound weights, and now I wouldnt be able to do that for a while.

He said, Really. Well, good for you. I hope you realize that by doing that you undoubtedly saved yourself a broken wrist.

I like the new bands workout because it adds variety to my strength training. The band moves are subtly different from the ones with free weights. After doing the routine, every part of my body feels toned. The bands DVD seems to get at the abdominal muscles even more than the first DVD, and I love the feeling of getting my abs toned.

Theres just no way to express how much Susies strength training has transformed my life. At 74, I feel good. I feel powerful. And I like that feeling!",1414886400,42,1468,4.362637362637362
6282630,5,B00INDQ4VU,"I absolutely love Susie's exercise programs!!! I have her Safe Strength Training and her Resistance Band Training DVDs, and both are wonderful. I was just diagnosed with osteoporosis and searched for a comprehensive but safe weight-training program; and I highly recommend both of these DVDs for anyone in a similar situation. I also had a wonderful ""customer service"" experience. One of the DVDs tended to stick on an exercise, so Susie IMMEDIATELY sent me a replacement disc. Best DVDs and best customer service ever!",1413331200,4,519,5.190476190476191
6282631,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Susie Hathaway's resistance band training DVD is the best strength training DVD I've come across so far. I have done quite a lot of different weight training and I like this one the best. I like the way the DVD is structured into different sessions. If I run out of time, I can do only one or two and finish later in the day. The movements are smooth yet challenging. I can feel the difference in my muscle strength even after just a few sessions.

6282632,2,B00INDQ4VU,She moves very quickly from one suggested movement to another.  Its discouraging and frankly won't use it.  You don't get a workout because of her constant changes while you're trying to learn it.  Not for me.,1411948800,3,209,4.75

I couldn't wait for her 'Resistance Band Training for Osteoporosis Prevention' to come out. In a communication with Susie, she stated, ""They (the bands) look deceptively easy.""  That is for sure!  I can't believe how much of a workout you get with the bands. Susie is so supportive and so encouraging as she helps you through the exercises.  I love her statements that she says ""Keep breathing"" and ""You can do this!""  The music is great. The set is bright and cheerful and the entire DVD is wonderful.",1411948800,6,635,4.88785046728972

6282636,5,B00INDQ4VU,"From the first note of the warm-up music, I am smiling.  I have several work-out videos, but this one has my favorite warm-up.
 It really does get you sped up.  In fact, I  occasionally use just the warm up during that afternoon slump to get my metabolism going again or even before doing other exercise videos.

After the warm up, we get down to business.  Susie Hathaway coaches us in the proper use of resistance bands to effectively build and strengthen muscles and slow down bone loss and improve balance.  I know it is effective because the next day I am very aware of my muscles and posture. I love that feeling!

This exercise DVD is great for travel because all you need is your resistance bands, which I purchased from amazon.com, and a chair.  But it is not just for travel.  I alternate it with several other DVD'S, including ""Susie Hathaway's Safe Strength for Osteoporosis Prevention"".  It is the best way to exercise efficiently when you don't feel like getting down on the floor and messing your hair and make-up.

Don't underestimate this exercise program.  You WILL see and feel results and say ""Boy, I'm glad I did that"".

REVIEW UPDATE :  Since my first review, I have leaned that my sister broke her hip. Now I am more determined than ever to be faithful to my workouts with Susie.  The specific moves she coaches us through using exercise  bands in the correct way are the BEST I have ever felt effecting the hips and balance.  I too have been diagnosed with severe osteoporosis but I am determined to NOT follow in my sister's UNSTEADY footsteps.",1407715200,20,1569,4.602888086642599
6282637,4,B00INDQ4VU,"Using the bands on the upper body was fine, but for the lower extremities, I found it awkward.  The exercise sessions were just too slow and I did not enjoy exercising with the band on my foot.  However, the DVD is good for exercising all the muscle groups necessary for spine and hip strength.  Susie always has you to perform very good stretches after each exercise.  After using the DVD a couple of times, I really could feel the difference.  But, it was just to awkward and dull.  I have moved on to a quality trampoline that is a bit more fun and tones and strengthens the entire body.",1403568000,3,590,4.36697247706422

Her explanations are the clearlest, and the use of the resistance band for lower body uses techniques I've seen nowhere else.  I like the suggestions she makes throughout about how to make each exercise easier or harder.  I've purchased both of her osteoporosis prevention DVD's and use them alternatively, once a week each. I really feel that I've worked all my major muscle groups well at the end of each session.  I look forward to Susie's next DVD for still more variety in osteoporosis prevention.

I am really enjoying the exercises and Susie's upbeat, engaging style. I find this workout to be just the right amount of challenge - not exhausting, but definitely leaving lots of room to grow and improve fitness levels. Working with resistance bands feels good, and I appreciate that Susie is very aware of modifications that some people may need in order to exercise safely.

Best of all, this workout is fun - colorful, energizing - I often myself smiling as I work through it. I really look forward to my time with this routine. Highly recommended.",1401408000,23,665,4.635593220338983

If start out with a little ache or pain, or a feeling something just a little out of whack, this workout fixes it!  And the Resistance Band Training for Osteoporosis Prevention DVD is just the thing to work my muscles in a different way from the free weights workout, yet the results I feel are the same: more strength, more balance, and more energy!

I like the new DVD even better because for me the bands cost less than the weights and are much easier to store between sessions. I look forward to being able to add more resistance at my own pace more economically.  I'm glad I have both DVDs because they will allow me to vary my training, and I'll be less likely to get bored. I'm looking forward to my next bone density scan to see what progress I've made using these two programs together with better nutrition and some supplements suggested by my doctor!

6282646,5,B00INDQ4VU,"After learning I had osteopenia several years ago, I attended Susie's classes regularly. When not able to get to class the bands are so easy to use or take with me on trips!
The band and free weight strength training classes have helped me prevent more bone loss and improve balance. It is great to have both the free weight and the band workouts, since they use slightly different muscles. After a band workout, I can feel arm and leg muscles were used a bit differently. The stretching of the bands works on balance in a different way than holding weights.
Since I am an avid gardener, the strength training has helped me to be more flexible, stronger, and have better endurance to do all the twisting/turning work in the yard and garden. It also has helped give me the strength, balance, and flexibility for my aerobic workouts whether I am walking, hiking uneven trails, or biking.
It is wonderful to have the bands and the band workout to use while traveling. The bands take up no room in a suitcase and I can do the workout easily in any hotel room [or on the beach if you are so inclined!:) ]
It is so nice to have Susie's expert guidance on how to move properly, so I can exercise safely . I have friends who have injured themselves from exercising following untrained 'instructors'.",1397779200,6,1291,4.521367521367521
6282647,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Since doing resistance training twice a week, for over a year now, I notice a big difference in how I feel day to day.  I used to experience back pain, but now I rarely have it. I would get tired doing cleaning or outside yard work. The only thing I do differently is resistance training.  I know I feel much better and am stronger to do the daily tasks around the house and yard.  Thanks, Susie for making a difference in my life!",1397692800,3,431,4.168674698795181
6282648,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Building Strong Bones and realizing how it improves your Posture was a profound moment for me personally in my Professional and Personal Career and Susie Hathaway has been part of my journey. Instead of fearing Osteoporosis, I am so Positive that I am building Buff Bones and Standing Taller because of her DVDs. I just received the Resistance Band DVD and Susie did it again with New and Effective Exercises. Posture starts for me with a strong Core AND Back and Arm Muscles and this DVD is Exceptional because you know how to modify depending on your initial Strength. I Chunk it down and do a 15 minute segment if I am at home, the office, the airport and yes, I may look a little funny with my Resistance band but I have had other women ask me if it helps before getting on planes and my reply is Absolutely!!  Great things take time and Both DVDs are in my tool kit to Stand Tall and stop the rounded shoulders I got but No More!!  Regardless of Age, start NOW and by doing these 2 DVDs, I change out and Surprise my Bones and my Brain and Laugh when my Resistance Band went flying out of my hands at the airport!  Also check Susie out the National Osteoporosis Inspire site and she frequently answers exercise questions!  Thank You Susie!",1397174400,7,1244,4.419213973799127
6282649,5,B00INDQ4VU,In some ways I like resistance bands even better than weights for strength training.  They seem to get muscles I don't get otherwise.  And Susie makes it fun and easy.  I pack them in my suitcase and can use them in the smallest of hotel rooms.,1397001600,4,244,4.260869565217392

She gives complete, easy to understand instructions for her exercise routines. and has a wealth of information about osteoporosis that she shares in the DVD.

I am active but this is challenging for me, and I can see that if I stay with it I can keep traveling, putting my bag overhead on trains, etc.  Well produced!",1507680000,,319,4.266666666666667

8643639,5,B00INDQ4VU,"Thank you, Susie, for a great workout DVD! I am 69 with osteoporosis in my spine (diagnosed via Dexa years ago BUT without any fractures). I have been regularly exercising since age 30 first by running and now by long, fast walks. I have also used light weights at a gym for years. I felt stuck with my routines and know the importance of changing things up. I ordered your DVD and did my first workout today. Wow! Even with a pretty good fitness level I found my muscles working hard. And it is good to note that I can use thicker bands or even double up on bands to challenge myself further. This is going to be a great new addition to my exercise routine!",1502236800,2,658,4.23015873015873
