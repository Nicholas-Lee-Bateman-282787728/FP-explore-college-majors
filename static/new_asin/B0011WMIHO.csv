8242834,5,B0011WMIHO,"This film is more a docu-drama based on the lives of two children brought up in Australia by their very feckless Chinese mother (Joan Chen),

It's an 'emotional roller-coaster' to borrow that much-overused phrase. But it is Chinese art-house at it's best. I think 'sunflower' would be my number one Chinese film, but this is a very close second place.

Joan Chen is her usual brilliant self, and the rest of the cast is top notch. You simply have to see it, and if you haven't seen 'Sunflower' yet, order that as well.

If it's got Joan Chen in it, you can't go wrong.",1396396800,,568,4.4423076923076925
8242835,5,B0011WMIHO,"The Home Song Stories, based on a true story, stars Joan Chen as Rose. Joan Chen was born into a family of doctors and educated in China during the Mao era, and she is considered the Elizabeth Taylor of China.

Chen delivers a powerful performance in this film, which won a slew of foreign awards.  Rose is a lost soul with two children who moves to Australia after marrying an Australian sailor she meets in Hong Kong.

The film is set in the late 1960s and the Australian sailor turns out to be an honorable character. See the movie to discover why.

Later in the film, its revealed that at sixteen Rose was sold to an older man to become his concubine.  But Rose falls in love with her master's younger brother, an artist, and they run away together.  A few years later, the love of Rose's life dies from tuberculosis. To survive, she becomes a night-club singer who takes a string of lovers. The story is told from her young son's point of view.

8242836,4,B0011WMIHO,"In 1964, an Australian Navy officer Bill had a beautiful Hong Kong singer Rose Hong and her two kids imported to Melbourne, Australia.

Missing a natural environment, beauty was looking around for a better deal every time returning to a home of a nave lovesick Aussie, at one stage even managing to bring about her much younger lover-illegal resident, which resulted in being thrown out in some time by an instantly fooled naval serviceman's traditional mother.

A really handsome, confident in his sexual worth gambling-addicted youngster is bored with instant demands ageing mother of two and her kids impost on him and looks for new adventures with underage step-daughter surely.

In less delighted with a number of universities and not so ""clever country"" lands, paranoiac schizophrenia could be a diagnose for Rose having at last successfully committed a suicide from the third attempt.

Bill had supported kids till his pre-mature death from stroke in 1977.

Some same gender affairs' spirit is in the air and watching DVD of moviemaker's family history is better than a movie at the cinema as scenes deleted added  usefully to a feature screened.",1247961600,,1153,5.1063829787234045
8242837,5,B0011WMIHO,"I have seen this movie twice now. The first time you get sucked in by the overwhelming pathos, the turn of events, the wide eyed innocence of the narrator (Tony Ayres the director) and the human condition displayed rawly on the screen. The second time round you get a chance to appreciate the music, the props, the clothing and somehow it is not as melancholic either because you know that the movie ends on a positive note.

I thought that the acting was superb. Joan Chen plays the role extremely well with a mixture of fragile sensuality and ferocious impulsiveness at work.

A very personal, warm and heartfelt movie. One to keep.",1220313600,5,634,4.651785714285714
