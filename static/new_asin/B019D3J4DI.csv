8744756,1,B019D3J4DI,"My bad. I bought the film based on the DVD cover. I expected a young girl to be kidnapped and then Michael Madsen save her in Romania because Seagal had Bulgaria and Liam Neeson had Albania. Not even close. Two photojournalists working for a travel magazine or something are working in Romania. They are in a small village and Miriam (Andrea Stefancikova) wants to see her dad's grave marker. As it turns out dad was not that nice of a guy and she gets kidnapped by inept criminals. The characters were stupid...and I mean that literally. Madsen grunted when we first meet him. There are two special farm hands and Bogdan (Gouchy Boy) was really pathetic

Low on action. Drama not that great. Terrible script.  $9.96 US Walmart
