8279699,1,B001AUKUUY,"There is NO ""Call of the Wild 2"" as this title might lead you to believe. The entire series(1 season,13 episodes) on 3 discs: Call of the Wild-Complete Series is the best way to go. It is even a better deal. The episode Foxfire and the entire pilot are included in the above mentioned complete set.  The ""complete series"" set runs 420 minutes.

Secondly, although an excellent show with some original story lines that had great potential - once again don't let the title fool you -it is 'based on' but is not 'Jack London's' Call of the Wild. There are some storylines that have similarity to certain episodes/adventures in the book, but basically it is about Buck the dog, and the life he may have led after all the trial and tribulations he went through in the book, finally settling with a family that loves him.

The story takes place in a small gold mining town in the Yukon around the late 1800's-early 1900's. Buck comes to town, to be auctioned as a sled dog and Miles Challenger, a teen with aspirations of being the best guide there ever was, wants to own Buck desperately, but the bidding is getting very high. Of course, Buck does become part of Miles' family, and is proved to be one great dog, usually saving lives and the day.

The stories are suspenseful, adventurous, and as we get to know the inhabitants of the little town, and share their personal lives, many of the episodes are heartwarming as well. Some of the episodes even have a wonderful mystical note to them,including Indian lore and a visit from a famous gunfighter who as history tells us was not even alive at that time. Although basically a family friendly series, I wouldn't recommend it to the very young child. There are some scenes which may be too violent or scary - dog fighting, bear attacks, murder, etc. Also,as I mentioned that there is no season 2,the last episode leaves us hanging as to what will happen with some of our favorite characters.

The acting is wonderful - Buck is fabulous, and a young Shane Meier interacts expertly with Nick Mancuso as his step-father who is trying hard to both teach Miles the ways of the frontier and be a father to a reluctant step-son;the scenery, - much taking place in the snowy mountains is gorgeous; and the background music gives the perfect tone to the stories.

I really enjoyed the series and would still recommend it. I think it could have developed into something great, maybe another Lassie. 4 stars for series(I probably would have to say five if it didn't leave us hanging)but the misleading title, in both calling it Call of the Wild '2' and 'Jack London's' Call of the Wild, plus the fact that the entire series is actually the better deal cost-wise, makes this edition a 1 star purchase.

I was very confused when trying to figure out the various editions. I checked over at IMDB to see if there actually was a 2nd season - there is not - so I hope this helps anyone as confused as I was.
Enjoy the one season there is and Happy Trails.....Laurie",1329955200,,2994,4.543599257884972

8279702,5,B001AUKUUY,"This is a very enjoyable continuation of The Call of the Wild dvd with Shane Meier. While not a true telling of the London novel these are both very good enjoyable tales for any dog lover. The biggest drawback is the ending of Foxfire makes you say ""that's it? that's the end?"". My husband and I were both left wanting to see more of this shortlived Animal Planet tv show. Unfortunately, we have been unable to find any dvds of the program that apparently ran from March of 2000 to June of 2000.",1269043200,,495,4.333333333333333
8279703,4,B001AUKUUY,"This movie ended with to many ""loose ends"". The overall movie was pretty well done. I wondered why they did not answer some of the questions in this movie until I looked it up and found out that this was part of a thirteen episode TV series that aired on Animal Planet in 2000. This movie was episode 5 in the series. I have only been able to find two of these on DVD. I would like to find the rest.",1265328000,2,399,3.9382716049382718
