7807171,5,6300250091,Great for score improving. Techniques don't fail.  I have an old copy dating from the 80's which I had stored for many years but recently I found that it has all but faded; that's why I'm purchasing it again. Wish it was recorded in DVD format.,1319500800,,244,4.304347826086956
7807172,4,6300250091,"Score More! (1988) is a pretty good video to teach novice bowlers how to bowl properly, but can also benefit more experienced bowlers.  I'm a self-taught bowler, but I can appreciate what Bo Burton was trying to accomplish with this video.  However, I feel that Bo doesn't put enough emphasis on teaching from the ground up, such as the fundamentals like footwork, armswing, timing, etc.  Probably the biggest thing that I agree with him on is when he recommends the semi-fingertip grip, a grip that very few people use.  I happen to use a full fingertip grip, but I think the semi-fingertip grip is a grip that is a good balance between power and control.  Probably the most famous bowler who uses a semi-fingertip grip is Marshall Holman.  Bo Burton shows you how to practice at home, how to fix problems in your game, improving your strategy, the mental game, and how to practice smarter.

Overall, it's a good video that I recommend.",1314489600,2,937,4.711656441717792
7807173,4,6300250091,This is a must have for any bowler.  I've tried several different methods but this helped me the most.  He even show you haw to warm up at home before a tournament and how to use a mirror to watch yourself bowl.  It really works!,976492800,6,229,4.044444444444444
