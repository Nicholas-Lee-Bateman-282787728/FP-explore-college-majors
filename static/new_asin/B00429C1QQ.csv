4246964,5,B00429C1QQ,I like this dvd. It's lots of fun to do and not too difficult. I like it! My daughter loves to do it too. Smooth transaction.,1318809600,7,125,3.8461538461538463
4246965,5,B00429C1QQ,"I love this workout!!  The country dance moves make exercising fun. I've been using this for 3 weeks now. I started off with only 10-15 minutes and have worked my way up to 30 minutes now as it was pretty intense at first compared to what I was used to, which was only walking on the treadmill for exercise. This workout makes you sweat!  There are a lot of moves to each dance but it's easy to get the hang of with repetition. The step-guide at the beginning is beneficial but I only needed it once since Amy has you repeat the moves several times (before putting all the moves together) for each dance exercise. Some reviews complained about the music, this wasn't an issue for me. If you want REAL country music you can always use your stereo in the background. This workout is really worth trying.",1318550400,20,801,4.405405405405405
4246966,3,B00429C1QQ,"The DVD is good as far as aerobic exercise goes. Don't use it to learn line dancing. The basic steps are gone through a few times and even at a slower pace, and you can always go back to review them; that makes it easier to stay in step with the program. I purchased this at Amazon.com.",1317945600,5,286,4.035087719298246
4246967,5,B00429C1QQ,"I am very happy with my purchase, I cannot always keep up with them, but that does not matter, as I am MOVING and that's whats important..as I am an older person, I do not get too puffed out and it is really fun.  thank you.",1313539200,19,224,3.869565217391304
4246968,1,B00429C1QQ,"The video is goofy, the setting is pathetic, the music is terrible, and they hardly work your arms at all.  The front girl can't dance for anything, and the two in the back are too busy trying to look cutesie!  This is the stupidest video I have ever seen!",1310515200,7,256,4.204081632653061
4246969,4,B00429C1QQ,"I bought this dvd after watching some of the routines on youtube and at collagevideo.com.  The dances are easy to do & the instructor, Amy Blackburn, will break them down for you during the routine, then she gradually adds each dance into the routine.  Also, there is a separate ""Step Guide"" section on the dvd that walks you through each dance move. I enjoy myself so much when I'm doing this that I forget I'm exercising!  You will definitely work up a sweat when working out to this dvd.  If you like having a bit of fun while exercising then this one is definitely for you!",1304467200,9,577,4.415094339622642
4246970,3,B00429C1QQ,"The workout is called ""country Line Dance Party,"" so I guess I expected music that I could party to.  However, this music is really generic with no lyrics, really hard to stay interested in.

The workout itself had my heart rate up and you definitely get moving, but I was looking for a real country dance party with actual country dance tunes and that is just not the case.",1299974400,90,374,4.405797101449275
4246971,5,B00429C1QQ,"I have a lot of dance workouts and although Country line dance isn't usually among my favorites... I loved this DVD! It had really creative steps, easy to learn instruction, and what a sweat! Buy this DVD!",1295049600,32,205,4.5675675675675675

4246979,3,B00429C1QQ,Fast moving. Too fast moving for a beginner. Not enough repetition before new steps are introduced. Perhaps better suited for someone who has a basic knowledge of this kind of dancing.,1488758400,3,184,4.967741935483871

4246992,5,B00429C1QQ,"I just finished the workout for the first time and loved it!!! I used to dance folklorico (regional Mexican dances) so I enjoy learning routines like this instructor teaches them.  I didn't see the breakdown of the steps and I was able to catch on pretty quickly. There were a few moves that took me a few times to get but I got them all by the end. The time went by really fast. I didn't feel the ""ugh this is a workout and hope it is over soon"" like I have felt with other dance dvds. It is a perfect fit for me.

4247000,1,B00429C1QQ,Very boring. Tired it a few times. Not fun. Doesn't make you want to do it again. Waist of money.,1462060800,3,97,3.9
4247001,3,B00429C1QQ,This is a fun workout but it is a workout not a line dance so it's a little misleading in the title.  Lots of jumping around which is hard to do with a bad foot.  It will get your heart rate up.,1460851200,,194,3.5952380952380953
4247002,3,B00429C1QQ,It said for any age or shape. But I'm too old to do the moves being taught.,1459209600,4,75,3.4705882352941178

4247005,5,B00429C1QQ,I like that they go slow enough it first to make sure you get the steps. I bought several videos and this is my favorite,1458259200,2,120,3.84

This DVD was not a good work out and progressed incredibly slow. After giving it a good half hour of ""dancing"" and basically still just standing around my mom, who loves line dancing and wanted to try it with me, and I gave up and quit since it was so boring and stale. After turning it off I went for a run and had so much more fun than waiting around for the DVD to finally kick it up a notch and make me do some sweating. Since that faithful night I have yet to give it another try; perhaps in the future. I would not recommend.",1453075200,,690,3.832167832167832

4247016,5,B00429C1QQ,I am not coordinated at all but I thought dancing would be a fun new workout routine that I would hopefully stick to better than the elliptical if it was more fun. Amy Blackburn (instructor) is amazing. I don't find her annoying at all and she teaches the dances in small pieces before doing the whole dance. She goes slowly and leads with saying the next step right before she does it so you know what's coming and can keep up. I've always had confidence issues and I'm a little on the heavy side so I was skeptical at first but I've been doing this video for almost a year now and I still love it! I had only been doing it 3 days a week for about a month before I started noticing a difference. I don't weight myself so I can't say if it works as a weight loss regime but my confidence is higher than it has ever been in my life! I find myself breaking out in these moves just while cleaning the house or goofing around. I've never felt so good about myself and I absolutely owe it to this dance workout. I now alternate between this video and the Firm Up one. They're both absolutely wonderful!,1429747200,29,1097,4.179245283018868

The overall idea is cool, I've always wanted to learn how to do some country dance moves but her sh*t is boring and lame and all you do is do the same thing over and over and over and over again. I strongly recommend you not buy this DVD.",1404259200,5,377,3.973684210526316
4247034,4,B00429C1QQ,"I bought this along with Club Line Dances 1 & 2: Beginner Lessons. Before buying, I read through most of the reviews, so I had reasonable expectations that I would be able to handle the workout. I'm 53, in reasonably good shape, have lost 60+ pounds in the past year, and walk 4 to 5 miles every day. I have attempted this workout several times, and still do not have the moves down, however, I am certain I will enjoy the workout if I can ever learn it.",1399161600,8,454,4.170454545454546

For the first class we did the how-to step, the first two dance chapters and the cool down for a 40 minute workout.  None of us are elite athletes.

Yes, it's fun, but I get a little bit lost in it all (mostly because some of the transitions feel awkward to me). The music, as others have said, is terrible. Overall, the workout itself is not bad. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't tell someone not to get it (thus the three-star rating). I occasionally do it, and do sweat some, so I figure if I'm burning calories it doesn't matter if I get the moves exactly right as long as I'm not hurting myself in the process.",1386115200,,645,4.295081967213115

Also the dances are not your line dances you will do at the dance hall, instead they consist of elements of various line dances put together to create unique routine for a work-out video. In some ways it kind of reminded me of doing modified aerobic routines. Now ... all of that aside ... it WILL work you out (aerobically and physically) and it is fun if you get past what you may be expecting (well, I should say what I was expecting ;0)",1372723200,14,589,4.130434782608695

Every since I was a little girl I loved Fred Astaire, Shirley Temple and dancing in general etc.  Line dance looks like great fun.  The instructor is excellent in my opinion and I am learning a new thing which improves the brain cells. Also I am burning more calaries beside Kathy Smith workouts, Mari Winsor's pilates, and Callan's Callenetics which are really wonderful.  I like to be active and I enjoy variety.

4247067,2,B00429C1QQ,"I was excited about this DVD thinking that I would learn the 'country dance steps' & loose weight having fun.  I was seriously disappointed when I watched it knowing that it was only for those that are familiar with the country dance steps & a quick learner.

I've gotten very little use from this item because it has too many different types of dance steps, moves toooo fast & as she tells you 'right or left' & uses the names of the steps (you need to focus on the fact that she is facing you & you have to do the opposite directon), it is overwhelming to try & keep up & LOTS OF PRACTICE is needed before you are familiar with all of the steps & can actually follow the exercise portion of the DVD.  It also would have been helpful if she wasn't standing the opposite way while teaching the steps - know that you are learning the opposit way!

On the positive side, the dance step are separate from the 'exercise' portion of the DVD & you can rewind/repeat as often as necessary.  I just didn't have the time to practice as much as needed!",1343520000,4,1042,4.242424242424242
4247068,4,B00429C1QQ,"I really enjoyed this DVD. It definitely got my heart rate up and I broke a sweat. The moves were easy to learn, even without the Step Guide. I wish it worked out your arms a little more. The back-up dancers were somewhat obnoxious and annoying. Overall, I would definitely reccomend it!",1337817600,,287,4.538461538461538
4247069,3,B00429C1QQ,"Not at all what I was looking for.  I thought it was actually going to be line dancing but it's an exercise video.  One of the routines is called ""Brand New Girlfriend"" but doesn't even use that song to dance to.  If you are looking for an easy exercise routine then maybe this is for you.",1335484800,,289,4.125
4247070,3,B00429C1QQ,"I LOVE this instructor's other country line dance party DVD, which I purchased first, but I was a little disappointed with this one. It's less of a workout and a bit more cheesy than the other.  It's still a decent product if you enjoy line dancing, but I thought the intensity level was a let down.",1330819200,7,299,4.339285714285714
