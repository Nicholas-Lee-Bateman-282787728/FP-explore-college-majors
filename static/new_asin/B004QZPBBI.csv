8438626,5,B004QZPBBI,What can I say? Robin Lim is an amazing woman and truly authentic. I do wish she would have spoken more on why it's so important to have a loving and nurturing birth but this movie is an account of the amazing things she is accomplishing.,1410134400,,238,4.195652173913044
8438627,5,B004QZPBBI,This is such an excellent documentary.  Very grateful for Robin Lim and her desire to bring peace into the world. This movie was a great encouragement and example to live out the truth right where you find yourself.,1407888000,,215,4.657894736842105
8438628,3,B004QZPBBI,Not what I was hoping to see. It didn't have enough birth and information about birth in it for me.,1368748800,,99,4.0
8438629,5,B004QZPBBI,"Very well made and important film on the importance of birth in a natural environment. The midwife asks: ""would you trade your authentic self for technology?"" Apparently, many, at least here in the US, have and will continue to and are even unaware that they have.",1360972800,3,264,4.760869565217392
8438630,5,B004QZPBBI,"I wasn't sure whether this was going to be a dvd all about being a midwife or what??? I was very pleased I watched this DVD Robin Lim is truly a special person....Mother, Midwife, Poet, Humanitarian. We do get to spend a lot of time learning about her life as a midwife around the world. But, we spend time learning about other cultures and life after disasters like the tsunami. We also get to hear her poetry read through out the dvd......truly beautiful.",1360454400,2,457,4.518072289156627
8438631,5,B004QZPBBI,Robin Lim speaks loudest when she says nothing at all. Listen carefully to the section regarding GMO rice and the relation to maternal death from hemorrhage.  What is not being said?  Listen to the silence in the birthing rooms.  Listen to her hands.  Listen.,1352419200,8,259,4.818181818181818
