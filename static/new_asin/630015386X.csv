210587,3,630015386X,"One of the more obscure ''sequals'' that were done to the original 1939 movie was this animated TV special shown as a Thanksgiving special. Since the live-action movie was traditionally shown at or around Thanksgiving, this special was aired under the title Thanksgiving In The Land Of Oz, which is a slight fusion of Land Of Oz, Ozma Of Oz, and Emerald City Of Oz. Here, Dorothy is getting ready for Thanksgiving with her aunt and uncle, even though they have to move off their farm. She then runs into the Wizard(voiced by Sid Ceasar)who has made a giant turkey-shaped balloon for a Thanksgiving parade, but she ends up getting caught in one of its ropes and flies away to Oz. Once there, she meets Jack Pumpkinhead. He is holding onto the Powder of Life, but the wicked Tyrone the Terrible Toy Tinker(this show's version of the Gnome King)uses it to bring the turkey balloon to life so he can take over Oz. Dorothy and Jack head out to stop him, and along the way run into Hungry Tiger and Tik-Tok, plus accidently give life to Dorothy's mince pie. They find Tyrone and convince him to be good. Dorothy is then reunited with her old friends, and meets Ozma who brings her family and farmhouse from Kansas to Oz.",1257552000,,1214,4.5479452054794525

210589,4,630015386X,"I have watched Peter and the Magic egg since I was just a child. I always loved to watch it during eater time and it brings back so many memories! A classic cartoon featuring the original PAAS egg dye characters! A timeless classic, very enjoyable!",1174089600,2,248,4.533333333333333
210590,5,630015386X,"I just picked up a copy of this at a thrift store. I hadn't seen it (or even thought of it) in at least 20 years, when I was still very little. I couldn't believe how much of it I remembered! I even remembered the words to the songs! It made me feel very nostalgic. Its such a cute cartoon! I totally recommend it! Anything that can jolt my memory so shockingly like that must be (and is) an excellent film.",1163808000,,407,4.037037037037037
210591,5,630015386X,"I have always loved this cartoon, nothing says Easter more to me than watching Peter give the animals gifts so they will be able to talk. It may intrest everyone to know that on top of just being a great classic cartoon the characters in it live on to this day as the mascots of the 125 year old PAAS Easter dye kit company, replacing the plain brown bunny that was once their trademark with the lovable Cotton the white rabbit (who, since I was born in 83, has been there for as long as I can remember).

All I can say is buy this VHS, it's truly worth it, and hopefully maybe even PAAS will someday put it out on DVD...",1144108800,2,621,4.090163934426229

210664,4,630015386X,"Bought It just for Dorthy in the Land of OZ.  I used to watch it all the time as a kid.  Had it recorded on a Tape.  Dont know if it got taped over, Thrown away or lost when moving but I had not seen it for probably 20 years.  Bought it when I first saw it.  Awesome to see it again.",1414454400,,283,3.5

210667,5,630015386X,"I remember watching Peter and the Magic Egg every year at Easter when it came on as a Sunday night TV special in the spring.  Having it on DVD now is a welcome treat because it means I get to share it with my 3-year-old daughter while I reminisce.  There are no bonus features, but they're not necessary.  The story is the key here and it's just as fun as I remember it.  The addition of Dorothy in the Land of Oz as a second half hour special is all the bonus I need!",1365120000,,468,3.9468085106382977
210668,5,630015386X,I loved this show when I was a kid and I bought it for my daughter for Easter because I remembered how much I loved watching it. We watched it as a family before Easter and man I was easily entertained as a kid. This show is so boring and just crappy. I am still happy with it and will force my poor husband to watch it every year with me. I did learn that something that was great to my kid self does not always translate into something great to my adult self. My daughter liked it though and my husband and I got a good laugh out of it. It will be a fun tradition until my daughter realizes how lame it is.,1343606400,,608,3.872

210671,4,630015386X,"My kids and I watched this when it was broadcast on TV and we taped it. Over the years, the tape got misplaced. This season we watched it again, this time with THEIR kids!
Wonderful story that has all the right elements for a young mind; color, music, good and evil.
Gonna' be a season staple.",1274400000,3,293,4.25
210672,2,630015386X,I took a chance on this video for my granddaughters and I must say it did not hold their interest. The story is kind of goofy. There are many other Easter videos that are much better.,1272758400,,183,4.111111111111111

7803376,2,630015386X,"This was NOT what I was expecting from Paramount/CBS!  Unlike their Puff The Magic Dragon triple feature, the source material for this DVD was a VHS release of Peter And The Magic Egg.  It has the Family Home Entertainment logo at the start of it, which means it's a rip of the FHE VHS release from over 25 years ago!  The VHS to DVD conversion is typical of VHS to DVD conversions.  The video is bright.  The Liberation Kids DVD from about 10 years ago has a better video quality.  The biggest selling point of this DVD release over the older one is this one has subtitles.

Shame on Paramount for not using an original source print and going for a cheap VHS rip.",1437091200,,664,4.306451612903226

The villain Tobias Tinwhiskers is no match for Peter and the animals as they save the farm from Tobias' s greedy hands. There is singing, dancing, friendship, and problem solving. Mother Nature has her own magic, the magic of laughter, in her magic egg and with the help of the Easter Bunny, the farm is saved . I believe your family will enjoy this  movie.
