4484538,5,B004VUR68O,"""Merry Andrew"" made me laugh out loud ... and will continue to do so again and again.  Yes, it warrants repeated viewings.  If you love Danny Kaye, as I do, you will love ""Merry Andrew.""  In my opinion, it ranks among Kaye's very best movies.  And this remaster was beautifully done.  I only wish that the publishers had possessed enough material to provide some ""special features"" about the making of this movie.  In particular, I would love to know if Mr. Kaye performed his own stunts on this one ....  It wouldn't surprise me if he did: he had such masterful physicality.  I recommend this hilarious movie to all silliophiles!",1323302400,4,630,4.663636363636364
4484539,5,B004VUR68O,"Andrew Larabee (Danny Kaye) is a professor at the Larabee School for Boys but he is not happy.  He is more interested in archeology than in teaching so, during a school break, he sets off for a ""dig"" in a British meadow to try and find a lost Roman statue.  His fiance, Letitia Fairchild (Patricia Cutts) is not happy since he is delaying their marriage on something she considers foolish.
When he reaches the meadow he finds the Gallini Circus has set up right where he wants to dig.  He manages to find the statue but Selena Gallini (Pier Angeli), niece of circus owner/ringmaster Antonio Gallini (Salvatore Baccaloni), becomes trapped in the pit with him.  When they are discovered in the morning Antonio and Selena's brothers demand that Andrew marry her.  While trying to figure out some way to get away without marriage Andrew is forced to become ringmaster for one performance and ends up bringing down the house with his inadvertent clowning.
He escapes and returns to the school with a whole new outlook and begins the new term with a much lighter teaching style.  The Gallinis track him down and, in the end, it all works out.
This is one of Danny's best and it is almost never seen on TV.  It is loaded with laughs and fun tunes.
After seeing this movie you will never forget what the ""square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle"" is.",1322438400,8,1346,4.583333333333333
4484540,5,B004VUR68O,"Is this Kaye's best? Naw! But, it's not his worst either. What I loved, as a tween was Selena. There is something about her that made this movie work. When she is with her dad and brothers there's emotion in the air. What I admire about Kaye is that when there is emotion in the air he grabs, climbs up on it, and whirls it around--for example the Toast Scene.  On the other hand, Andrew's family, dad and brothers, no chemistry. Even Andrew's fiance, Letitia was stale. Selena loves life, her motivate in the movie is to break free from the constraints imposed by her family. Kaye needed Andrew to have that same passion--but, alas, he didn't.

Selena and Andrew were married ####
Divorced ####
Selena joined Circus Soleil ####
Andrew's whereabouts are unknown.",1322006400,,762,4.67910447761194

4484542,5,B004VUR68O,"I was waiting so long to get this movie remastered on dvd.
Here it is. Danny Kaye is a so various talented singer and actor and this movie is brilliant for him.
The court jester is also a very good and a must see for all who liked Merry Andrew.
I'm a big circus fan and also a circus artist, this movie shows what a real circus is about.
Not a circus factory like today, no it's a family tradition. Colourful and Funny !",1314662400,8,420,4.011904761904762
4484543,4,B004VUR68O,"For several years (over 15) I have looked for this wonderful Danny Kaye film.  I remember it quite well from my childhood and was just as good as I remembered.  I'm not sure why it was never released on VHS or why it took so long for it to be released on DVD.

Fun but not as slap-stick as many Danny Kaye movies.  A joy for the whole family.",1313798400,3,342,3.9130434782608696
4484544,4,B004VUR68O,"With the exception of catching glimpses of this movie years ago--occasionally on a local TV station--""Merry Andrew"" is another Danny Kaye vehicle that's been shelved somewhere. DVD technology has changed all that.
About a would-be archaeologist who inadvertently digs his way into a lion's cage during a circus show--and becomes a hit--he gets comically & romantically entangled in the affairs of the circus folk..most notably, a young raven-haired beauty which jeopardizes his engagement to someone else as his two worlds threaten to collide.
In truth, MA is not Kaye's best film, nor is it his worst. The songs lack the delightful ""novelty"" punch where Kaye usually excelled (his wife, composer Sylvia Fine, did not work on this one). The exception--a rowdy ringside song called ""Salud""--is the liveliest number, as Kaye cavorts merrily with the cast, highlighted by some good choreography.
But really, any of Kaye's films are never without merit, simply because he was in them; he was such a wonderfully talented performer. Watch him in the scenes with the lion's cage, the malfunctioning ringmaster's costume or the chimp playing chess, and you'll see how good & funny he is.
Again, not Kaye's best, but certainly good enough to include in your collection!",1310342400,20,1260,5.211822660098522
4484545,4,B004VUR68O,"I looked for this movie for YEARS. It seemed as if Danny Kaye movies (with the exception of a couple of his staples) were never going to be released to DVD.

This one tells the tale of a college professor bound to a staid (ie: boring) job and life until on an archeological dig he ends up in the circus. (literally) It's a fun, rather risque (for its time) romp about Danny and the ringmaster's daughter. The music is really nothing special in this one but there's fun under the bigtop and ok, ""Salud"" was amusing.

I'd say this one is a must have for Danny Kaye lovers.",1308096000,21,570,4.268518518518518
4484546,5,B004VUR68O,"As the opening scene played... I decided precisely whom I wanted to marry. I was plotting the nature of Time Travel so that I could settle with my beloved Danny Kaye.

Then my housemate came in, and midst a replay of ""Tickety Boo,"" told me, ""Danny Kaye's wife wrote that song...
She wrote all his music."" Oh, dear,... now I can't go back in time and... oh, not without causing an uproar. But behold, my housemate had erred! Saul Chaplin and Johnny Mercer wrote the songs for this film, not Kaye's wife.... Maybe I can claim him from Time, after all!

Oh, but he belongs with one of the film's stars...

Loved the songs, loved the silliness, love Merry Andrew's smile.",1483920000,,667,4.4958677685950414

For me, I would give it five stars, but that's cause i somehow ended up with the soundtrack album when I was a little kid and I loved the songs, so finally seeing it was a real treat.

I will say that what I can contribute is an assessment of the print itself -- said to be remastered -- which I think is just beautiful.  You can tell how much has been improved when you compare the film to the included trailer -- quite a difference.

Archeologist schoolteacher, he is convinced that there are Roman ruins in a field where a circus has set up for performances.  Always rather a misfit in the school room, he learns that he may have a future as a clown with the circus.

Kaye plays a schoolmaster with a lovely fianc&eacute;e.  One day he stumbles into a circus, and meets an attractive aerial artist.  How Kaye resolves his love life, while staggering through the trappings and paraphernalia of the circus, makes for a sidesplitting comedy.

I was reminded of this movie recently when my son was doing math using the Pythagorean theorem. If you've ever seen the movie, at this point the song is going through your head too. If you haven't seen it, the song about the square root of the hypotenuse will be a new mind worm, as will Tickety Boo.

The only problem I had with this was that it was a smallish picture with black around all 4 sides on my 16:9 TV. But, eventually I was able to ignore that and enjoy the movie.",1369008000,,624,4.032258064516129
