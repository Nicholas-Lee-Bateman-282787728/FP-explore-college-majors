8185993,5,B000BNMX3I,"This is another set of interesting very early films from when directors were still not sure what people would pay money to see. This set is particularly interesting because unlike other ones which were short on motion, all of these clips contain various variety acts. You see jugglers and dancers and even burlesque strippers.

It's all very experimental and I'm sure its' not for everyone, but I enjoyed watching the filmakers try to figure out how motion pictures were supposed to work.

There is no commentary, so you sort of have to work out for yourself what is going on.",1153094400,2,576,4.75
