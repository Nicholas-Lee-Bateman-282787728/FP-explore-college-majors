8192827,5,B000PMLJ1W,"Yu Yu Hakusho may not be the most popular anime above dragonball z, naruto, evangelion, etc.  But it does have everything they all have and more.  To be honest the english dubs for all the other animes just sound like the voice actors are reading instead of putting true emotions into their voices to make it sound real.  That's the what yu yu hakusho has over almost all the animes I have ever seen.  The voice overs are outstanding and I think that's one thing that everyone should know separates a good english dubbed anime to a bad one.",1189814400,2,540,4.424242424242424
8192828,5,B000PMLJ1W,"In Yu Yu Hakusho: Sixth Sense, you will get 14 terrific episodes of the show on two DVDs. Specifically these are episodes 71 to 84 and all occur as part of the Chapter Black, or Sensui Saga. Yusuke Urameshi has won the Dark Tournament and resumed his everyday life, but when three teenagers come to meet Yusuke, he finds they have strange psychic powers. The ordeal to rescue Yusuke from these psychics was in the last volume, but now Genkai reveals the point of the ordeal. Someone is continuing Sakyo's plan to build a tunnel connecting the Living World with the Demon World.

In Mushiyori City, psychics are popping up all over the place, demon insects are everywhere, and a giant tunnel is quickly being made to usher in the end of humanity. Some of the new psychics choose to help Yusuke to stop the tunnel from being created, while seven others try to ensure its creation is successful. These seven psychics, all human, go under the names Black Angel, Gate Keeper, Gourmet, Seaman, Doctor, Game Master, and Sniper. If Yusuke is to save humanity, he must stop them.

Eventually, Black Angel is revealed to be the leader of the group, his real name is Shinobu Sensui. The Spirit Detective before Yusuke, Sensui witnessed first hand the evil of men and now wishes for humanity to atone for its many sins. By the end of this volume, most of the seven are defeated, leaving only Sensui and Yusuke to face off in a climactic showdown. The volume ends here, but leaves you wanting more.

Sensui is definitely a unique villain. One of the most interesting kinds of villains are those who were at one time heroes, and the reason why Sensui became evil is very intriguing. Of course, what makes Sensui so interesting is the fact that he truly believes he is doing the right thing. Another interesting point in these episodes is that our heroes are forced, more than once, to choose between taking human life, or allowing the world to end. This saga has many questions of morality and it is definitely interesting to see how each character answers them.

Overall 14 good episodes of a great show. I recommend this to any fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, or anime in general. Just make sure you have seen the earlier episodes first. In the next volume, the two spirit detectives clash, and secrets will be revealed about both Sensui, and Yusuke!",1185667200,7,2328,4.62953995157385
