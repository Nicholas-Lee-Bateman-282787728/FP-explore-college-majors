3155162,2,B0016APR8S,"This was my very 1st time watching this Sho Kosugi classic - I've seen the huge VHS box back in the day at the video rental stores but never got around to renting it.  Anyway, the movie was a little low compared to Sho Kosugi's standard of ""Revenge of the Ninja"".  It actually cut to a lower resolution during the ""deleted"" scene where his wife was murdered in the hospital, and that seemed really weird.

Overall, it's a must if you're a Sho Kosugi fan.  The actual fighting is pretty pathetic compared to today's standards, though.  Oh well...  It was the 80's, right?",1302480000,2,570,4.485436893203883

I did not find any problem with the quality of the movie, picture, sound, or otherwise. I have been told, though I can't confirm this as it is the first time I've seen the movie, that it has more scenes then some other cuts, mostly small shots that make the action a bit less jumpy and confusing, but some bigger ones as well.
As for the movie itself, it is much better then I thought it would be, very entertaining",1294185600,2,576,4.342592592592593

3155167,5,B0016APR8S,"I will star by saying that this is the BEST Sho Kosugi movie ever because all the ninja fights and stunts were entirelly made by him!! From a COOL traditional ninja fight intro to a ONE MAN ARMY ninja in shining armor conclusion!!!

The reason that this movie is better than Revenge of the Ninja is because Sho Kosugi is always masked in black on his best fights, Kosugi also don't recieved to much strikes from bad morons, Kosugi also use a FREAKING COOL ninja armor at the final fights, the fights were MUCH BETTER choreographied and the action is faster and more explosive.

The only stuff that I didn't liked is that there is no main black ninja enemy like in Revenge of the Ninja, but the one to one fights were fast and cool!! Besides, who needs another black ninja when we have Sho Kosugi. :)

This dvd is maybe a copy of the Pray for Death VHS version, so the picture quality is not THAT good and the movie have the standar view (not widescreen). This is what I recieved.

P.S: Sho Kosugi and his son Kane Kosugi are together again after Revenge of the Ninja, both father and son fought well in this movie.",1225756800,7,1114,4.341346153846154

3155179,5,B0016APR8S,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Some of my fondest childhood memories are of watching ninja movies with my little brother.  We couldn't get enough of those masked assassins, and we devoured every title we could find.  Over the course of our ninja phase, we probably watched well over 30 titles.  But even so, one actors name quickly stood out:  Sho Kosugi.  For us, he was the real deal, and we had no problems believing he was truly a ninja.  Come to find out, Kosugi really IS a ninja and has studied many forms of the art.  As such, his films are classified by some (myself included) as classics of the martial arts genre.  PRAY FOR DEATH is one of these iconic titles, and I enjoyed it as much today as I did when I was a kid.

When looking at films like this, you have to remember:  these paved the way for modern-day classics, such as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, IRON MONKEY, and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS.  As such, some of the action may seem a bit relaxed when compared to these recent hits.  This is by no means a negative for me, but I feel I have to warn you in advance; some folks expect modern-day action in older films.

PRAY FOR DEATH is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The Blu-ray transfer looks amazing, and the picture is a testament to HD quality.  Likewise, the sound is top-notch.  You cant ask for much more from an 80s-film update.

The acting in PRAY FOR DEATH is good for a film of this nature.  Some action films have wooden performers who either overact to the point of hilarity or cannot act to save their lives.  This film boasts a nice cast, particularly Kosugi himself, who I always found to be a fairly credible actor.

But the action is the biggest winner for me in this movie.  Chocked full of martial arts mayhem, theres a lot to enjoy.  The fight scenes are fun, and so is the gore.  I had forgotten just how much carnage we get, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The special effects look good, and theres quite a few of them.

Arrow and MVD have another hit on their hands with PRAY FOR DEATH, and I highly recommend it.  Existing fans of the 80s ninja-craze will be nostalgic, while newcomers will find plenty to enjoy here as well.  The film is available now, so make a note to grab it.",1459900800,,2278,4.334123222748815

3155182,4,B0016APR8S,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

When video stores could be found on every corner there was a rush to fill the shelves with tons of product that renters could check out once the hit titles were cleared from the racks. Where B films were once the second features in theaters they were now the add ons to those stores. Some of those films got minor releases around the country but for the most part made their mark on the video shelves. Among one of the top stars of this genre was Sho Kosugi.

Kosugi made his made his first major appearance in the film ENTER THE NINJA, starring Franco Nero, as the bad ninja in that film. He went back and forth from good guy to bad in a series of films that always featured the new martial arts character, the ninja. It wasn't enough to be a martial arts master, now ninjas were the rage. It was only natural that he follow in the footsteps of his hero Bruce Lee to become a new figure of note.

PRAY FOR DEATH features Kosugi stars as a ninja who is married with two kids. When his wife wants to move back to the states and open a business he agrees, leaving behind his ninja ways and swearing to never reveal his abilities. Not an easy task when you consider his two young sons are major ninja fans adoring the black ninja on telelvision.

The family moves with the intent of taking over a storefront they intend to turn into a restaurant. Unfortunately a group of criminals has been using the back room to store stolen property in, this time around a valuable necklace. Roughing up and killing the former owner when the jewels go missing (taken by a corrupt cop) doesnt get the goods back so they go after Kosugi instead by kidnapping his son. Big mistake. He meets with them, escapes and rescues his son and leaves them bloodied and beaten.

The big boss won't stand for this and its apparent that soon fists will be flying, ninja stars thrown and an all-out battle between bad guys and Kosugi will soon happen. In the middle of it all will be a family placed in danger and if anything happens to them Kosugis promise to keep his ninja skills hidden will fall to the wayside.

The plot sounds fairly simple and the truth be told it is. But story isn't the major force at play in any martial arts movie and in particularly the ninja movies of the time. Instead the plot is something to give rise to the action. Kosugi, an award winning martial artists, does a great job of leaping, fighting and creating mayhem as the ninja in question here. He may not display the same grace, speed and abilities of Bruce Lee but he does better than most.

Fans of the films Kosugi made at this time have had to comfort themselves with VHS copies of these movies but now Arrow Video is bringing some of them out in blu-ray format. As with all things Arrow theyve done a great job here with an excellent transfer as well as some good extras that fans will appreciate though they seem sparser than are usually found on Arrow offerings. Included here are a brand new interview with Kosugi, an archive interview and ninjitsu demonstration with Kosugi at the films New York premiere and the original theatrical trailer.

Im sure not everyone will find this as entertaining as I did but it does deliver a decent action film that can be enjoyed. And for those who walked the aisles of video stores looking for something different then youll find those memories stirred while watching this. Up next will be RAGE OF HONOR from Arrow in March.",1456876800,2,3478,4.4234375
3155183,5,B0016APR8S,"Ok so I received my blu ray today, I was anxious and excited. I have loved all of the Cannon Ninja films since I was younger, and Pray for Death is another favorite. Sho Kosugi is the Ninja Master!!! After the title screen came up, I noticed trailers, Revenge of the Ninja, Enter the Ninja, Pray for Death, and Rage of Honor. There are also features about Sho Kosugi, I will get to those later. So after starting the film I noticed what I believe to be one of the best, cleanest transfers ever done. The colors were crisp and quality was clear. There are also two versions of the film, an extended version which is longer and the R rated version which was on the VHS version. The movie was excellent to watch once again, as I had not seen it for years. If you love the 80's ninja films as I do, this one is a must have. The film is so clear you notice things I hadn't before, add this to your collection!!!!!!",1455926400,10,909,4.170454545454546
3155184,5,B0016APR8S,"Anyone who knows anything about Ninja cinema, knows Sho Kosugi. The martial artist/actor who came to prominence in the 80s with Cannon films' Ninja trilogy (Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja and Ninja III: The Domination) was untouchable when it came to over the top, violent, gory martial arts films. Arrow Video's new release of the 1985 classic Pray for Death is no exception.

In this film, Kosugi plays Akira Saito, a Japanese businessman who, unbeknownst to his wife and two sons (played by his real life sons Kane and Shane), also happens to be a ninja. Saito's wife talks him into moving to the USA, where he opens up a Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately, some mobsters also happen to use the restaurant's back room as a place to deal drugs and stolen jewelry. After a crooked cop steals the mob's goods, Saito is blamed and is thrust into a one man war that requires his secret skills.

Pray for Death is as gory, sleazy and fun as any 80's Ninja film you're going to find. Kosugi kicks major ass and spills blood at every chance. The film is filled with colorful characters, including good cop Lt. Anderson (Norman Burton), kind old timer Sam Green (Parley Baer), crime boss Mr. Newman (Michael Constantine) and James Booth as what is probably the greatest villain name ever in the history of the world - Limehouse Willie. Willie is a nasty bastard who gets his jollies from killing and Booth's portrayal is hilariously sadistic. Though the story is fairly simple and predictable, the stunt work is top notch and the action doesn't let up. This film fits well with the many martial arts films of the time and Arrow's release is another small miracle. Featuring the rarely seen uncut version (as well as the original R rated version), this disc is really special. Also including some great extras featuring Sho Kosugi and a nice booklet that makes Arrow's discs stand out from the rest. My only one gripe is that the scenes originally cut from the R rated version look a little washed out and dark compared to the rest of the beautiful transfer, but I'd much rather they were here than not and praise Arrow for including them.

Bonus Features include:

-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation from a transfer of original elements by MGM
-R-rated and Unrated Versions
-Optional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing
-Brand new interview with star Sho Kosugi
-Archive interview and Ninjutsu demonstration with Kosugi from the film's New York premiere
-Original Theatrical Trailer
-Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin",1455667200,,2601,4.891156462585034
3155185,3,B0016APR8S,"Ninjas might be an endangered species now, but in the '80s they were everywhere:  movies, television, cartoons, action figures.  The nerdy kid who bagged your groceries?  A ninja.  That ***hole who stood you up at prom?  A ninja.  You couldn't toss a Frisbee in the park without some ninja knocking it out of the air with a throwing star.  They were a menace, I tell you!

Full disclosure, that might be completely accurate.

But that's the thing about ninjas; you just never know where they'll pop up.  Like in Arrow Video's new blu-ray release of Pray for Death (1985) starring Sho Kosugi who kick started (see what I did there) the whole ninja craze co-starring with Franco Nero in Cannon Film's Enter the Ninja (1981).  Although that would be overlooking the mask-clad warriors inserted rather clumsily into Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (1974).  But now we're just splitting ninjas.

Rising from the ranks of martial arts extra into an almost accidental starring role, Kosugi went on to star in a pair of sequels for Cannon (the enjoyable Revenge of the Ninja and the enjoyably ludicrous Ninja III: The Domination) along with a TV show (The Master), doing an admirable job of following in the footsteps of Bruce Lee's legacy.  Pray for Death, however, feels like a more typical mid-80s action-revenge vehicle, a format that guys like Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris were on their way to perfecting.

Moving his family from Japan to the mean streets of Houston, Akira (Kosugi) has the misfortune of opening a restaurant in the same building where local gangsters have been hiding their stolen goods.  And when a priceless necklace disappears from the drop, a hired thug named Limehouse Willie (James Booth, who also wrote the script) blames it on the new guy in town.

After his son is kidnapped, Akira realizes he must use the ninja skills he's been trying to keep secret to take down Limehouse and his hired muscle once and for all.  It's guns versus swords, swords versus chainsaws, and a customized ninja bicycle you have to see to believe!

It takes a while for Pray for Death to deliver the goods.  We begin with a confusing series of flashbacks and false starts, supposedly setting up Akira's reticence to break out the nunchucks and start cracking skulls.  Kosugi's son, Kane, is elevated into an almost co-starring role, giving the film an almost 3 Ninjas vibe by taking on adults three times his size and generally causing trouble (he's the one who makes the aforementioned Huffy death machine).  And that leads to an unusually strange mix of TV friendly action and - in the uncut version at least - some extreme violence and gore.  The film is clearly indecisive about which marketing hook will work best, hoping that Kosugi's scenes alone with tie things up.

They don't.  And Pray for Death is far from the performers best cinematic outing.  But it is a slashing good time with all sorts of cool weaponry, impossible jumps and a paunchy, out-of-shape bad guy that is still somehow able to go 10 rounds with a trained Japanese master.  I guess they just don't make ninjas like they used to.

Arrow's blu-ray presents the longer uncut version along with the original R-rated cut.  You'll spot the additions as they have a slightly more contrasty look and only account for scenes where someone is spurting blood.  Overall, the film looks fantastic without any of the typical 80s softness to the image.  Bonus materials include a great interview with Kosugi who tells his own life story very well plus a vintage episode of show called Martial Art Forms with the actor demonstrating and speaking at length about his fighting philosophies (hilariously hosted by a turtle-neck sweater wearing NPR-type).  The original theatrical trailer is accompanied by all the trailers from Kosugi's '80s career.",1455148800,2,3810,4.877138413685848

He would have to settle for decent ones, as his six-year alliance with director Gordon Hessler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Voyage-of-Sinbad/dp/0767847431/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Voyage of Sinbad</a>) produced several serviceable vehicles but nothing to match his best work. Accordingly, ""Pray for Death"" will satiate fans but will probably only be counted as a favorite among nostalgics. It's a good, violent revenge movie whose sadism is sometimes questionably directed but otherwise does enough things right to warrant at least a rental for ninja fans.

The story: A secretive ninja master (Kosugi) and his family immigrate to America, only to be caught up in the deadly dealings of the local crime syndicate.

The film's alternate title should be ""Sucks to Know Kosugi,"" as his family - Donna Benz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Challenge/dp/B00UIHZWZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Challenge</a>) as his wife and Sho's real-life sons Shane and Kane - is subjected to a good deal of cruelty by the villains, and poor old Parley Baer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Ozzie-and-Harriet/dp/B000MGBSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a>) is beaten to death with a crowbar. The amount of violence directed at defenseless bystanders can be a lot to stomach, though it provides ample reason for the hyper-violent revenge scenes. Kosugi excels in these scenarios: he's completely believable as both the family man and the ninja, and displays a Bronson-esque level of toughness in all situations. He can be very cool to watch.

His main rival is James Booth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zulu/dp/B00008PC13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zulu</a>), who also wrote the movie and is a particularly despicable villain. It's unique that the main antagonist is just an enforcer and not the actual kingpin, and it makes for an interesting dynamic between the characters. All of the main players are pretty interesting, which is sadly more than I can say for the fight content. There are two good battles - a weapons-based fight between Kosugi and Robert Ito (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-a-Thief/dp/B00008J2EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once a Thief</a>) and the brutal, extended showdown with Booth - but the rest of the fighting is mostly overlookable, save for its brutality. Sho has never looked cooler than he does in his armored suit, but he suffers from a lack of credible opponents throughout most of the film. What he does not suffer from, however, is a shortage of flips: you would almost think this is a Shaw Bros. movie for all of the leaping somersaults.

Were the film consistently as cool as its best parts, it would earn another star for this rating. Particularly in his prime, Sho Kosugi was a more legitimate and believable performer than many of his contemporaries, but not enough filmmakers took full advantage of this. You can find many, many ninja movies not nearly as good as ""Pray for Death,"" but also several that are much better.",1427241600,6,3462,6.266806722689076

Movie review: This is probably my favorite Sho Kosugi film. His ninja outfit kicked ass and it was fun seeing him ninjitsu the **** out of the mafia. The final fight between Sho and the hitman was epic. The story was good enough to carry the movie. My only complaint is the little kid.

3389676,5,B0016APR8S,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Some of my fondest childhood memories are of watching ninja movies with my little brother.  We couldn't get enough of those masked assassins, and we devoured every title we could find.  Over the course of our ninja phase, we probably watched well over 30 titles.  But even so, one actors name quickly stood out:  Sho Kosugi.  For us, he was the real deal, and we had no problems believing he was truly a ninja.  Come to find out, Kosugi really IS a ninja and has studied many forms of the art.  As such, his films are classified by some (myself included) as classics of the martial arts genre.  PRAY FOR DEATH is one of these iconic titles, and I enjoyed it as much today as I did when I was a kid.

When looking at films like this, you have to remember:  these paved the way for modern-day classics, such as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, IRON MONKEY, and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS.  As such, some of the action may seem a bit relaxed when compared to these recent hits.  This is by no means a negative for me, but I feel I have to warn you in advance; some folks expect modern-day action in older films.

PRAY FOR DEATH is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The Blu-ray transfer looks amazing, and the picture is a testament to HD quality.  Likewise, the sound is top-notch.  You cant ask for much more from an 80s-film update.

The acting in PRAY FOR DEATH is good for a film of this nature.  Some action films have wooden performers who either overact to the point of hilarity or cannot act to save their lives.  This film boasts a nice cast, particularly Kosugi himself, who I always found to be a fairly credible actor.

But the action is the biggest winner for me in this movie.  Chocked full of martial arts mayhem, theres a lot to enjoy.  The fight scenes are fun, and so is the gore.  I had forgotten just how much carnage we get, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The special effects look good, and theres quite a few of them.

Arrow and MVD have another hit on their hands with PRAY FOR DEATH, and I highly recommend it.  Existing fans of the 80s ninja-craze will be nostalgic, while newcomers will find plenty to enjoy here as well.  The film is available now, so make a note to grab it.",1459900800,,2278,4.334123222748815

3389679,4,B0016APR8S,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

When video stores could be found on every corner there was a rush to fill the shelves with tons of product that renters could check out once the hit titles were cleared from the racks. Where B films were once the second features in theaters they were now the add ons to those stores. Some of those films got minor releases around the country but for the most part made their mark on the video shelves. Among one of the top stars of this genre was Sho Kosugi.

Kosugi made his made his first major appearance in the film ENTER THE NINJA, starring Franco Nero, as the bad ninja in that film. He went back and forth from good guy to bad in a series of films that always featured the new martial arts character, the ninja. It wasn't enough to be a martial arts master, now ninjas were the rage. It was only natural that he follow in the footsteps of his hero Bruce Lee to become a new figure of note.

PRAY FOR DEATH features Kosugi stars as a ninja who is married with two kids. When his wife wants to move back to the states and open a business he agrees, leaving behind his ninja ways and swearing to never reveal his abilities. Not an easy task when you consider his two young sons are major ninja fans adoring the black ninja on telelvision.

The family moves with the intent of taking over a storefront they intend to turn into a restaurant. Unfortunately a group of criminals has been using the back room to store stolen property in, this time around a valuable necklace. Roughing up and killing the former owner when the jewels go missing (taken by a corrupt cop) doesnt get the goods back so they go after Kosugi instead by kidnapping his son. Big mistake. He meets with them, escapes and rescues his son and leaves them bloodied and beaten.

The big boss won't stand for this and its apparent that soon fists will be flying, ninja stars thrown and an all-out battle between bad guys and Kosugi will soon happen. In the middle of it all will be a family placed in danger and if anything happens to them Kosugis promise to keep his ninja skills hidden will fall to the wayside.

The plot sounds fairly simple and the truth be told it is. But story isn't the major force at play in any martial arts movie and in particularly the ninja movies of the time. Instead the plot is something to give rise to the action. Kosugi, an award winning martial artists, does a great job of leaping, fighting and creating mayhem as the ninja in question here. He may not display the same grace, speed and abilities of Bruce Lee but he does better than most.

Fans of the films Kosugi made at this time have had to comfort themselves with VHS copies of these movies but now Arrow Video is bringing some of them out in blu-ray format. As with all things Arrow theyve done a great job here with an excellent transfer as well as some good extras that fans will appreciate though they seem sparser than are usually found on Arrow offerings. Included here are a brand new interview with Kosugi, an archive interview and ninjitsu demonstration with Kosugi at the films New York premiere and the original theatrical trailer.

Im sure not everyone will find this as entertaining as I did but it does deliver a decent action film that can be enjoyed. And for those who walked the aisles of video stores looking for something different then youll find those memories stirred while watching this. Up next will be RAGE OF HONOR from Arrow in March.",1456876800,2,3478,4.4234375
3389680,5,B0016APR8S,"Ok so I received my blu ray today, I was anxious and excited. I have loved all of the Cannon Ninja films since I was younger, and Pray for Death is another favorite. Sho Kosugi is the Ninja Master!!! After the title screen came up, I noticed trailers, Revenge of the Ninja, Enter the Ninja, Pray for Death, and Rage of Honor. There are also features about Sho Kosugi, I will get to those later. So after starting the film I noticed what I believe to be one of the best, cleanest transfers ever done. The colors were crisp and quality was clear. There are also two versions of the film, an extended version which is longer and the R rated version which was on the VHS version. The movie was excellent to watch once again, as I had not seen it for years. If you love the 80's ninja films as I do, this one is a must have. The film is so clear you notice things I hadn't before, add this to your collection!!!!!!",1455926400,10,909,4.170454545454546
3389681,5,B0016APR8S,"Anyone who knows anything about Ninja cinema, knows Sho Kosugi. The martial artist/actor who came to prominence in the 80s with Cannon films' Ninja trilogy (Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja and Ninja III: The Domination) was untouchable when it came to over the top, violent, gory martial arts films. Arrow Video's new release of the 1985 classic Pray for Death is no exception.

In this film, Kosugi plays Akira Saito, a Japanese businessman who, unbeknownst to his wife and two sons (played by his real life sons Kane and Shane), also happens to be a ninja. Saito's wife talks him into moving to the USA, where he opens up a Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately, some mobsters also happen to use the restaurant's back room as a place to deal drugs and stolen jewelry. After a crooked cop steals the mob's goods, Saito is blamed and is thrust into a one man war that requires his secret skills.

Pray for Death is as gory, sleazy and fun as any 80's Ninja film you're going to find. Kosugi kicks major ass and spills blood at every chance. The film is filled with colorful characters, including good cop Lt. Anderson (Norman Burton), kind old timer Sam Green (Parley Baer), crime boss Mr. Newman (Michael Constantine) and James Booth as what is probably the greatest villain name ever in the history of the world - Limehouse Willie. Willie is a nasty bastard who gets his jollies from killing and Booth's portrayal is hilariously sadistic. Though the story is fairly simple and predictable, the stunt work is top notch and the action doesn't let up. This film fits well with the many martial arts films of the time and Arrow's release is another small miracle. Featuring the rarely seen uncut version (as well as the original R rated version), this disc is really special. Also including some great extras featuring Sho Kosugi and a nice booklet that makes Arrow's discs stand out from the rest. My only one gripe is that the scenes originally cut from the R rated version look a little washed out and dark compared to the rest of the beautiful transfer, but I'd much rather they were here than not and praise Arrow for including them.

Bonus Features include:

-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation from a transfer of original elements by MGM
-R-rated and Unrated Versions
-Optional English SDH subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing
-Brand new interview with star Sho Kosugi
-Archive interview and Ninjutsu demonstration with Kosugi from the film's New York premiere
-Original Theatrical Trailer

3389682,3,B0016APR8S,"Ninjas might be an endangered species now, but in the '80s they were everywhere:  movies, television, cartoons, action figures.  The nerdy kid who bagged your groceries?  A ninja.  That ***hole who stood you up at prom?  A ninja.  You couldn't toss a Frisbee in the park without some ninja knocking it out of the air with a throwing star.  They were a menace, I tell you!

Full disclosure, that might be completely accurate.

But that's the thing about ninjas; you just never know where they'll pop up.  Like in Arrow Video's new blu-ray release of Pray for Death (1985) starring Sho Kosugi who kick started (see what I did there) the whole ninja craze co-starring with Franco Nero in Cannon Film's Enter the Ninja (1981).  Although that would be overlooking the mask-clad warriors inserted rather clumsily into Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite (1974).  But now we're just splitting ninjas.

Rising from the ranks of martial arts extra into an almost accidental starring role, Kosugi went on to star in a pair of sequels for Cannon (the enjoyable Revenge of the Ninja and the enjoyably ludicrous Ninja III: The Domination) along with a TV show (The Master), doing an admirable job of following in the footsteps of Bruce Lee's legacy.  Pray for Death, however, feels like a more typical mid-80s action-revenge vehicle, a format that guys like Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris were on their way to perfecting.

Moving his family from Japan to the mean streets of Houston, Akira (Kosugi) has the misfortune of opening a restaurant in the same building where local gangsters have been hiding their stolen goods.  And when a priceless necklace disappears from the drop, a hired thug named Limehouse Willie (James Booth, who also wrote the script) blames it on the new guy in town.

After his son is kidnapped, Akira realizes he must use the ninja skills he's been trying to keep secret to take down Limehouse and his hired muscle once and for all.  It's guns versus swords, swords versus chainsaws, and a customized ninja bicycle you have to see to believe!

It takes a while for Pray for Death to deliver the goods.  We begin with a confusing series of flashbacks and false starts, supposedly setting up Akira's reticence to break out the nunchucks and start cracking skulls.  Kosugi's son, Kane, is elevated into an almost co-starring role, giving the film an almost 3 Ninjas vibe by taking on adults three times his size and generally causing trouble (he's the one who makes the aforementioned Huffy death machine).  And that leads to an unusually strange mix of TV friendly action and - in the uncut version at least - some extreme violence and gore.  The film is clearly indecisive about which marketing hook will work best, hoping that Kosugi's scenes alone with tie things up.

They don't.  And Pray for Death is far from the performers best cinematic outing.  But it is a slashing good time with all sorts of cool weaponry, impossible jumps and a paunchy, out-of-shape bad guy that is still somehow able to go 10 rounds with a trained Japanese master.  I guess they just don't make ninjas like they used to.

Arrow's blu-ray presents the longer uncut version along with the original R-rated cut.  You'll spot the additions as they have a slightly more contrasty look and only account for scenes where someone is spurting blood.  Overall, the film looks fantastic without any of the typical 80s softness to the image.  Bonus materials include a great interview with Kosugi who tells his own life story very well plus a vintage episode of show called Martial Art Forms with the actor demonstrating and speaking at length about his fighting philosophies (hilariously hosted by a turtle-neck sweater wearing NPR-type).  The original theatrical trailer is accompanied by all the trailers from Kosugi's '80s career.",1455148800,2,3810,4.877138413685848

The story: A secretive ninja master (Kosugi) and his family immigrate to America, only to be caught up in the deadly dealings of the local crime syndicate.

The film's alternate title should be ""Sucks to Know Kosugi,"" as his family - Donna Benz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Challenge/dp/B00UIHZWZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Challenge</a>) as his wife and Sho's real-life sons Shane and Kane - is subjected to a good deal of cruelty by the villains, and poor old Parley Baer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Ozzie-and-Harriet/dp/B000MGBSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a>) is beaten to death with a crowbar. The amount of violence directed at defenseless bystanders can be a lot to stomach, though it provides ample reason for the hyper-violent revenge scenes. Kosugi excels in these scenarios: he's completely believable as both the family man and the ninja, and displays a Bronson-esque level of toughness in all situations. He can be very cool to watch.

His main rival is James Booth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zulu/dp/B00008PC13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zulu</a>), who also wrote the movie and is a particularly despicable villain. It's unique that the main antagonist is just an enforcer and not the actual kingpin, and it makes for an interesting dynamic between the characters. All of the main players are pretty interesting, which is sadly more than I can say for the fight content. There are two good battles - a weapons-based fight between Kosugi and Robert Ito (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-a-Thief/dp/B00008J2EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once a Thief</a>) and the brutal, extended showdown with Booth - but the rest of the fighting is mostly overlookable, save for its brutality. Sho has never looked cooler than he does in his armored suit, but he suffers from a lack of credible opponents throughout most of the film. What he does not suffer from, however, is a shortage of flips: you would almost think this is a Shaw Bros. movie for all of the leaping somersaults.

Were the film consistently as cool as its best parts, it would earn another star for this rating. Particularly in his prime, Sho Kosugi was a more legitimate and believable performer than many of his contemporaries, but not enough filmmakers took full advantage of this. You can find many, many ninja movies not nearly as good as ""Pray for Death,"" but also several that are much better.",1427241600,6,3462,6.266806722689076

3389692,4,B0016APR8S,"DVD Review: Concerning the ""Digitally Remastered And Restored and Uncut"" Bonzai, Panmedia, generic version. AAAAAAAAH YEEEAH! It is Widescreen. Except the part where the hit man raped and stabbed Sho's wife to death. It turned into full-screen for some weird reason. Overall, it's a great and wonderful generic product I highly recommend.

Movie review: This is probably my favorite Sho Kosugi film. His ninja outfit kicked ass and it was fun seeing him ninjitsu the **** out of the mafia. The final fight between Sho and the hitman was epic. The story was good enough to carry the movie. My only complaint is the little kid. It's cute seeing the kid beat the crap out of people who are quadruple his size but he is annoying as hell.

In conclusion: NO MORE FULLSCREEN CA-CA!! 5 stars for the DVD product and 4 stars for the movie.",1413676800,6,831,4.684931506849315

It's still a older campy ninja movie full of cheese but the character endures some serious hardship and by the end you really feel he was vindicated. You really do feel like you can relate to the character and that he is a ninja in modern day (well 80's at least). What would be awesome is if they remade some of his ninja movies now, Hollywood can't stop remaking superhero movies or any genre in fact. When do we get to see a resurgence of the ninja movies?

The scenes of Sam Green's beating, Aiko's hospital attack, the restuarant shooting, and some violence shown in the finale, have been cut or trimmed down from the film, The cuts are identical to those that were made for the North American VHS release from USA Home Video.
The movie is shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic widescreen).

While the picture quality is ok/good, it certainly looks a lot better than the pan and scan USA Home Video VHS release.
The DVD only comes with English Dolby Digital 2.0 sound, and no subtitles.

The MGM On Demand DVD release (MGM Limited Edition Collection label on DVD cover) is not to be confused with the unofficial bootleg DVD release that's been floating around for some time, claiming to be the uncut version, with different DVD cover art and an Uncut Version label on the DVD cover.",1333756800,6,907,4.770700636942675
3389712,5,B0016APR8S,"A 5 star movie, but the 3 stars is on account of the false information on the cover of the sleeve. It claims to be Uncut, but it is not. The beating death of Old Man Sam Green and the restaurant shooting are still censored. The only scene I saw that was extended/uncensored was the murder of Sho Kosugi's wife. You can tell it was extended by the drop in video quality and going from widescreen to fullscreen. The other complaint I have is that the movie isn't in 16 x 9 widescreen so you still see the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. I'm happy to finally have this classic movie from my childhood on dvd, I'm just irritated that it isn't fully uncut and the video sleeve says.

Edit: Just recieved the new blu ray release from Arrow Video. All I've got to say is ""It's about damn time."" Fans rejoice, the unrated version is finally here.  The movie has never looked or sounded better. The only complaint I have, (and it's a minor one) is that with the scene extensions the film quality drops a bit. But who cares?

Granted the films quite dated as it came out in 1985 but if plot holes were all the rage ""Pray for Death"" would be an Emmy winner. While the hilarious James Booth plays one mean SOB, the rest of the gangsters are just as amusing & campy. In fact, the entire acting in this film is so one dimensional its absolutely perfect viewing ala ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". As for Sho Kosugi's lukewarm choreographed fight scenes followed by the bad Pat Benatar theme song, this really is as bad as it gets.

8261958,5,B0016APR8S,"This Otaku John checking in to review and rate this excellent Martial Arts / Ninja genre film by the one and only Sho Kosugi.  As a super fan of anime, manga, Japanese light novels, Japanese film, and all things Japanese, I must say there is nothing quite as satisfying as a good Sho Kosugi flick. Some say Sho Kosugi is a fine actor, some say he's a good martial artist.  That's true, but the real deal is that Sho Kosugi is a true Ninja.  Of all the other stars of 80's ninja movies, and all the posers who had stunt men do their stunts, sword fighting and martial arts while ""conveniently covered-up"" in a ninja mask, Sho Kosugi was the only man to do his own stunts, sword fights, and martial arts, and often had to fill in to double by doing the same for other actors in his movies who couldn't pull it off themselves.  He is a true Ninja master.  This is one of his best films, with THE BEST of the BEST being ""Revenge of the Ninja"", which my brother and I were privileged to be able to see being filmed live when we were kids in the 80's.  (I only wish I could've met Sho Kosugi!!!)  Anyway, Pray for Death is a fine flick about revenge, and a Ninja trying to go legit business owner, only to be dragged back into violence when local mobsters mistakenly think he's got some of their stolen loot and take it out on Sho by killing his wife and trying to kill his two boys (played by his real-life sons).  So, Sho dons the ninja mask once more and takes down the mob in a sword-blazing slaughter that is sure to please any action fan.  Just like there is no martial artist ever to match Bruce Lee, there is no Ninja ever to match Sho Kosugi.  I'd love to meet the guy someday, and get him to autograph one of my Musashi katanas.  If you love Ninja / martial arts flicks, you should also check out anime in the same genre.  If you're new to anime, or think its just for kids, think again.  There's lots of shows aimed at the adult market that would be the equivalent of PG-13 or R-rated films, like ""Ninja Scroll"", Samurai Champloo, Blade of the Immortal, Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, Ninja Resurrection, and Shigurui.  Give them all a try.  Also, for live-action flicks, if the name ""Sho Kosugi"" appears anywhere in the credits, buy it sight unseen.  You'll be glad you did.  They guy is a one-of-a-kind hero.",1503532800,,2315,4.285057471264368
8261959,3,B0016APR8S,"This was the first movie that Sho Kosugi made after the well known Ninja ""trilogy"" consisting of Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, and Ninja III: The Domination.  This movie was made by a new studio (Cannon Group would go on to make the American Ninja series without Kosugi), and the quality of the movie went way down from the earlier films.  Not that those were masterpieces either, but where I felt the other movies never really dragged and had good pacing, this one (even with the unrated extended edition only clocking in at 1 hr and 38 min) felt way too long.

It did try to tell a more extensive story than any of the trilogy movies did.  The problem was that the story was not all that great and the action scenes were split up too much.  It starts out with Kosugi's family in Japan, and when passed over for a promotion he decides to move to America.  He ends up getting in bad with the local mob and his family ends up getting attacked.  It then turns into a revenge story similar to many other martial arts movies out there.  The end fight instead of Ninja vs Ninja ends up being Ninja vs mob enforcer who he should have been able to beat in about two seconds.  Instead there is just what is in my opinion an underwhelming fight that occurs after trying to level the playing field to make the ninja weaker.  One good thing about the film is we finally get to hear Kosugi's real voice because his lines are not overdubbed.  While he does have a thick accent, you can easily understand him, and it makes the overdubbing that was done in the Cannon trilogy movies even more dumb.

Where the set does shine however are the extras.  There are trailers for Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Pray for Death and Rage of Honor.  There is also the first part of a relatively recent interview with Kosugi, done only a few years ago at most where he looks back on his life and how he went from contemplating suicide when he could not pass university exams in Japan, to ending up in movies.  The second part of that interview is included on the Rage of Honor disc.  Then there is another 20 min interview segment done at the time Pray for Death was released where he appeared on what looked like a local cable access show in NY talking about the movie as well as different styles of martial arts.  Within that is a clip of him doing a sword demonstration at the NY premier of the movie.  There is also the R rated VHS/Theatrical version of the movie.  Very good extras  and one time where the extras far outdo the movie.

The A/V quality of the blu-ray is decent.  While it definitely looks like some restoration of the movie was done when it was transferred (especially when you compare the quality of the clips shown during the interview segment included as an extra) there are definitely spots where the age of the movie is apparent.  All in all I would say if you are a fan of the movie it is definitely worth getting on blu ray.  If you have never seen the movie but liked Kosugi's other movies and like going through the bonus materials, even if you are like me and do not think much of the movie itself, the extras make it worth the pick up.",1498953600,2,3156,4.31918505942275
