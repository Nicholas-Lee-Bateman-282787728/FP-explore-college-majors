6140169,2,B00D6DQ0FM,I'm not one for voice-over narration so my interest waned. Seemed predictable; didn't finish watching it and am not losing sleep.,1458172800,,129,5.190476190476191
6140170,4,B00D6DQ0FM,"This is a slow starting movie that evolves into a romantic story through a series of choices and fateful situations. It is a nicely done low budget film that takes you back to pre-marriage times when things were more haphazard;  emotions & feelings were much lighter and playful -- especially without the involvement of sex. Nothing dynamic, just a simple story of events & relationships developing between two new aquaintances.",1457395200,,428,5.114285714285714

6140172,5,B00D6DQ0FM,"I loved this movie. It seemed very realistic and authentic. Everyone could relate to it. It was done very well and it was fun to watch. I felt like I was there with the two main actors. It is romantic, interesting, and draws you in. You're always wondering what will happen next.",1462320000,,279,4.384615384615385
6140173,5,B00D6DQ0FM,"This is an incredible film from very talented Israeli director, Dani Menkin.  There are great long takes, visuals and an amazing chemistry between the two leads.  You can see Dani's documentary experience influencing this piece.  Fun to watch, especially in a group and definitely one to rewatch too!!  A+",1462320000,,305,5.163265306122449

6140178,5,B00D6DQ0FM,"""Je T'aime, I Love you Terminal"" tells the story of Emma and Ben, who find themselves for a day in Prague. Both are at crossroads: between flings and relationships, love and marriage, parents` pressures and following your own heart.
If you're looking for explosions and car chases... look elsewhere. This is a intimate film that relishes its small moments, in a way that may remind you of Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy. It has its share of funny moments and touching ones, and you get to those through something we don't get to see often enough in today's films: subtlety.",1459814400,2,579,4.858585858585859
6140179,5,B00D6DQ0FM,"Let this movie take you in real time to a day of fantasy, adventure and romance wandering the streets of Prague through the artist's eyes. The actors are beautiful and honest and the film is raw and fresh! I recommend this to anyone who loves and appreciates the art of film.",1459641600,,275,4.411764705882353

8630777,2,B00D6DQ0FM,There is slow and then there is excruciating. This film was the later.,1520726400,,70,4.461538461538462
8630778,2,B00D6DQ0FM,"The review below actually said what I felt venturing into this movie and trying to get into it: ""The male, Ben, was an emotional mess. Couldn't make up his mind about anything. No woman in real life would want to spend more than five minutes with this goofball.""  Even in the little bit I watched, this is what I picked up and so it was hard to relate to him in a romantic movie or role or even as a friendship guy role...
The other reviews had many with 4 & 5 stars so don't listen to my review only. It just didn't catch my interest enough to continue watching. Simply didn't like the lead male actor's character at all; and even the bit of him with the new woman, she also didn't move me. I guess it's true you have to be able to somehow relate to the characters or find them interesting enough to want to spend the length of a movie with and it just didn't happen for me.",1509840000,,875,4.087209302325581

8630782,4,B00D6DQ0FM,"Not too complicated, great storytelling and believable acting",1471996800,,61,6.75
8630783,2,B00D6DQ0FM,"** May contain spoilers **

2 1/2 stars.  The female lead, Emma, was adorable; fun, gregarious, and romantic.  The male, Ben, was an emotional mess. Couldn't make up his mind about anything. No woman in real life would want to spend more than five minutes with this goofball. No wonder his girlfriend wanted to dump him. I kept hoping he would grow up -- and grow some!

Most of this movie is fun and romantic, largely due to Emma's efforts. But the last 5 minutes is not. And that change of tone ruined for me. A person doesn't get many chances like the one starring him in the face. He was indecisive and missed his train (literally).",1469923200,2,636,4.410256410256411
8630784,5,B00D6DQ0FM,"I have been told by many of my colleagues that I should watch this film. Menkin really directs this beautifully. Didn't know the cast, however this is one of the sweetest and well written films I've seen in a while. Must watch!",1464134400,,227,4.428571428571429
8630785,5,B00D6DQ0FM,I loved this movie!  It's a realistic take on a not-so-typical relationship movie... and I actually laughed out loud. A lot!,1462320000,,124,4.904761904761905
