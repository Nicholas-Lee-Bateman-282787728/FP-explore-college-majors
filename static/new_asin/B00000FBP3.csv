This DVD has modern color footage of a Chino Planes of Fame F4U-1, a great WWII training film on the F4U, an original Pilot's Handbook, a short movie based on a real pilots F4U experience wich combines both new and WWII footage, and there are photos from a WWII pilots ""family Album"".  I especially liked the training film which goes through step by step proceedures for starting and flying the F4U.  There are great shots of the Corsair's cockpit and controls as well as external shots of the plane in flight.  The DVD title is superimposed over each page of the Pilot's Handbook, which is a little annoying, but overall I'm very happy with the DVD and would buy it again.",977097600,10,721,4.523076923076923

7908135,5,B00000FBP3,This is part of a series. This DVD is about a very special airplane of ww2 and Korean war time. This airplane did more than its fair share in action. The DVD shows the airplane up close and also shows the pilots end of things. I'm so happy to have it as part of my collection. Thanks. Rick L.,1357948800,,292,3.9661016949152543
7908136,5,B00000FBP3,Excellent video on the F4U Corsair.  Great aerial shots and lots of great information.  Step by step startup procedures and lots of information on flying this great airplane.,1215820800,,174,5.178571428571429
7908137,5,B00000FBP3,"I have the whole Roaring Glory series on VHS and they are excelent as far as I am concerned. The dramitized part is not that bad. It at least tells the story of the actual plane and pilot in the war. The special effects are not bad either. If the whole set comes out on DVD, I'll get it. I can sell the VHS on Ebay or keep it anyway. It give you an idea of what it's like to fly the plane and the flight scens are very well done. I recommend it for anyonw who is into aviation history.",1184112000,,485,3.8118811881188117
7908138,2,B00000FBP3,"The whole Roaring Glory series is only fair.  While the modern-day, restored aircraft footage is pretty good, the audio quality is awful. At times the ambient engine noise is so loud that you have difficulty understanding the pilot's words as he's describing a sequence.  That's just plain poor audio engineering.

The series can be rented from Netflix.  I was truly disappointed in all of these titles.",1163980800,2,403,5.0606060606060606
7908139,5,B00000FBP3,"This DVD is one of the best values a World War II enthusiast can find! Included is not only a full color flight session in your favorite WWII warbird, but the original training film and a full, printable manual. This DVD not only tells you what the plane can do, but this DVD teaches you how to fly it! If you have any interest in WWII aviation, buy this DVD!",1052784000,,359,4.142857142857143
7908140,5,B00000FBP3,"This is a terrific video. The DVD version is particularly good in that it includes extra features if you have a PC with a DVD player. The video quality is really good, detailed, and the WWII pilot training film is very interesting. You can pick which part of the video you want to watch, and if you're like me you will watch this film over and over. I have used screen captures to make great wallpaper on my PC. I'm ordering all 6 DVD's, and I wish there were more.",1032220800,2,465,4.177777777777778
