8073301,5,B000A2XD66,Two classic movies and one watchable 70's comedy in a cool looking holographic slipcase.  Well worth the bargain basement price.  The transfers of Caligari and Carnival are both decent and not in bad shape at all for the price.  They are not restored copies but still are quite watchable.  This one is a bargain.,1254700800,2,312,4.722222222222222
8073302,3,B000A2XD66,"...but Funland was just not up to snuff. Cool if you happen to be expecting a '70s T.V.-esque drama, but I was not. I was expecting a horror movie.
Carnival of Souls is cool if you must have the classics, although there are other collections that have this one that don't come with Funland.
The main attraction here is Caligari, of course, one of the world's first horror films. Awesome every single time. I may actually drop this product and just go with a copy of Caligari, though again, Carnival of Souls isn't bad.",1218326400,2,518,4.5212765957446805
