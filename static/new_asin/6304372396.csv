851187,5,6304372396,"If you love Anthony Hopkins and you love stories based on real (and very interesting) people, you will love this movie.  Its a movie with a story of a man that has it all and wants more, he loves hard and paints beautifully, and Anthony Hopkins pulls it off beautifully playing Picasso.  I was amazed at his ability to be romantic and seductive one moment, playful the next, and suddenly turn to a madman.  It was beautiful.",999820800,13,424,4.48051948051948
851188,4,6304372396,"It's a common fact that great artists often make poor human beings, unable to connect with real life in a decent way. It was certainly the case with PABLO PICASSO and we knew that before this movie was made. The film seems to say that he only loved women for the sake of his art. Being SPANISH, he was a latin man with a deep inclinaison towards his own ego. His control over the people he knew really destroy them in many ways. While it is a work of fiction, the performances keeps it interesting ,even if we don't have to take it all too seriously.",972777600,6,550,4.19811320754717

While it touches on his climb to fame, recognition and success in the art world, it focuses primarily on his personal relationships.  I love his work, but I  sure wouldn't have wanted to live with him!  The video had therapuetic  effects for me; I would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly  calls into question your own view of relationships, how they are and how  they should and shouldn't be.

851359,5,6304372396,"The film is narrated by one of Picasso's lovers, Francoise Gilet. She is exacting and factual in her story telling approach about the father of her two children. It doesn't seem as though she carried animosity towards the artist despite his numerous rendez-vous with other women during their living arrangement. She sympathizes with all his mistresses and women and she documents how they are damaged in one way or another after living with the great Picasso. She also shows respect and compassion in how he's ultimately shaped her to be better than she could be otherwise as she came out of the relationship stronger in having ""survived a Picasso"".",1470787200,2,649,4.963302752293578

851566,4,6304372396,"I'm surprised that this film remains unavailable on Netflix. A movie about the life of Picasso has been long overdue. I had the enjoyment of getting to read his biography by Arriana Huffington as well as being a long-time fan. Picasso was genuinely talented from the get-go. His father helped propel him into the nearby academies where he excelled. I've seen his earliest work and it is outstanding! This one painting of a ""First Communion"" which is not shown everywhere; so much attention to detail. Then as he goes through different stages of life, and different women he's courting, his theme or style always changes almost chameleon-like.
Picasso was in the Communist Party and that is how he managed to rub elbows with the bigwigs of society. I guess, without all that political involvement he could have been yet another starving artist anomaly in a studio apartment surviving on ramen noodles...A few of his great works bring to light the torment and horror of war i.e. (Guernica) I got to tour MOMA in New York and got a chance to stand in front of ""Les Demoiselles de Avignon"" It is a very large canvas, about 8 by 9 feet. Picasso was quite the ladies' man and borderlined on womanizing and using. He dated classy women though, I will say that...The woman who he spent a decade of his life and gave him two children, one of them, the lovely Paloma, who has her own line of perfume- is Francoise Gilot and she is still alive too, and my grandmother's age...she had an exhibit in Newnan GA about ten years ago and I attended as I live close by. She is a great artist too and her work is nothing to sneeze at! Darn, I could kick myself for missing the opportunity to meet Francoise in person in Newnan; anyone who has dated Picasso is practically a celebrity!!
Picasso thought the ideal woman was ""patient and submissive""..(referring to Paloma when she was little) I figured Gilot could no longer be submissive at some point. Even though he was a talented genius, I doubt that Picasso could have been easy to live with. Heck, his first wife (Olga) and girlfriend (Dora or Maria Therese? definitely one of those two) literally fought it out between them over Picasso. He was a native of Spain and as a rule men in this culture think they can have any woman they want. Spain is the bullfighting capital of the world and Picasso was very much into this sport as you can see in some of his work.
I think Picasso hated the thought of dying in the end. He is famous for having said ""Don't put off til tomorrow what you are willing to leave behind undone if you died"" Even with some of his shortcomings he lived a great, productive and fascinating life.

The key to all great art, visual or performance is that the work must never show, it must appear effortless. However the work must exist. I have the feeling Mr. Hopkins phoned this one in. There is never a sense of under lying power, danger just beneath the surface that may erupt at any moment. No real emotional life just superficial words spoken in the typical A Hopkins manner, as a man without passion. Had Picasso been so  there would have been no art as there is none in Mr Hopkins performance. Not that it is bad...it just is non existent.

851763,1,6304372396,"The biopic is an unfortunate medium for relaying truth. One would hope for a disclaimer like `a true-ish story' or Hitchcock's maxim (`it's only a movie'). At least that way the inevitable claims of it being bogus (or at worst agitprop) could be side stepped in advance.

In Surviving Picasso, Merchant/Ivory have followed up the biopic conundrum of Jefferson in Paris, by making another biopic. This time they've chosen a more contemporary figure from whom to dish the goss- Picasso.

The story; rich, famous old guy (Picasso) hits on ingenue (Gilot). She is wrapt from the first and the affair gets off to a heady start. Ten years on and two children later, it's all soured. She (not surprisingly) has more future than him - he's more than forty years her senior - so she calls it. He cries (boo-hoo) and for the first time since Casagemas suicide, Picasso reveals his inner feelings through his work - the result being the Verve suite of 180 drawings. These simple drawings depict Picasso as an emotional/sexual pygmy (or some kind of ugly cupid)  - a far cry from him being the sex monster (minotaur).

Even the film's title use of the word `surviving' misfires in the market. By rolling the nazi occupation up with the presence of Hannibal the cannibal, one might think something really bad is going to happen. (Yawn) - It doesn't.

The film states it's based on Stassinipoulous Huffington's Picasso; Creator and Destroyer. Already the pedigree of this inherently flawed tome would have been a ready-made millstone - adding to the producer's woes. Critically the book was seen as a cut and paste non- effort with dodgy content - a repainting of Picasso as the twentieth century's answer to Bluebeard.

Picasso himself (either rightly or wrongly) had argued against an earlier calumny - the 1964 kiss and tell bio Life with Picasso. He'd claimed the book's authors Gilot and Lake had put their own words into his mouth. Worse still, R.P. Jahbvala's script has gone one better by putting other peoples words into his mouth - Brassai's for one. `Imagine a cold blooded creature like a fish being unable to survive the arctic climate of my apartment'. It seems R.P. Jahbvala couldn't resist a bit of cut and paste herself. The line is lifted directly from Brassai's writing (of himself) from Conversations with Picasso. Other travesties turned sacrilege include the words of Matisse, ""next to Picasso they think I'm a schoolgirl"" being borrowed to come out of Picasso's mouth. What wasn't plagiarised or re-arranged from these two books was conveniently created out of licence - more credibility issues ensue.

On the upside there are some casting delights in Surviving Picasso. Joss Ackland as Matisse, Juliane Moore as Dora Maar along with appearances by Joan Plowright and Bob Peck - all of them wonderful performers. On the downside, every other actor is either miscast (looks nothing like them) or inappropriate (acts nothing like them). Dennis Boutsikaris as Sam Kootz? - One thinks of the many ill-suited Hitlers auditioning in Mel Brook's master spoof, The Producers.

By far, the biggest casting error is its star Anthony Hopkins. He may have an ego and a baldhead like Picasso but that's where the similarity stops. While succeeding at making the scripts unwieldy dialogue sound natural, Sir Anthony gives the laziest performance of his career. He might've hoped that puffy-chest arrogance along with the mirada fuerte (intense stare) could carry off the whole Spanish genius disguise - but it's a hollow effort. Again no prior knowledge of the subject would be a boon (for the viewer).

While the knock-off Picasso paintings are an upset for the eyes, it's the locations and the production design that become the real pleasure in watching Surviving Picasso. Les Grand Augustines, Brasserie Lipp, Les Deux Magots, Chapelle du Rosaire - all the actual locations are used (no expense spared) and all are perfectly period in the setting of the war years.

The Merchant/Ivory modus operandi (ie. palpable drama that refuses to beg disbelief) becomes dismantled by this self-defeating choice of subject. Picasso is just too darn well documented already (in literature, film and photography) for this re-enactment to be taken seriously. For a balanced view of events, you can't go past reading - (scholarly efforts like J. Richardson or at least the musings of H. Parmelin).

The by line for Surviving Picasso, is that Gilot was the only woman strong enough to leave him. Utter nonsense. G. Laporte (also a Picasso author and ex-lover) as well as Marie Therese knew very well when to tell Picasso, `enough was enough'. Others, like Sylvette David (with whom there was a fifty year age gap) wouldn't let him get past first base. In Laporte's case she found Picasso to be something of a softie. Even Gilot herself (in interview) is quick to point out that contrary to legend, Picasso was not formidable.

So from where does this wretched inference (of a virgin consuming minotaur) derive? Picasso himself (through many of his works) was the progenitor of this fantasy/fallacy. It fed into his Spanish-macho ego and it made him feel six inches taller. He was well aware that `sex sells' and for a while he was keen to live his life in a goldfish bowl reality (for all the world to see - however contrived). It's interesting to note that the inamoratas weren't too badly rewarded themselves (fiscally by Picasso). Picasso could be extremely generous and combinations of money, real estate and works of art would be gifted to the loved ones. The ex's were also inadvertently gifted with the chance to write best selling (and unauthorised) novels about their former`love'. At least three of them did.

 While Picasso was clearly no saint, it is unfair that in Surviving Picasso, many of his virtues are not thought of as `bums on seats' capital.

The story is poor and came out of a self-serving book. Ladies who go to bed with rich old guys should not complain that they are misunderstood: it is a business. Hopkins, the best actor of his generation, cannot pull out being Spanish, which is probably impossible for an English gentleman. All his reactions are wrong, and if you had had a chance to see Picasso in person or in a movie, you would cringe at every gesture Hopkins makes. Being Spanish is a whole culture, the gestures are part of it.
A portrait of Picasso as a brutal lover has no interest at all. And Picasso was not like that: he was selfish, but he was also very cunning, a man of very cold intelligence (where is that in the film?), maybe cruel but always calculating.  I was stricken by a comment of the movie Jefferson in Paris, here on Amazon, which said that Jefferson appeared as a ""racist pedophile."" Here Picasso appears as a misogynist creep. Who needs movies like that? Not me, sorry.",1313107200,,1544,5.655172413793103

I wish there had been more scenes of Dora Marr (Ms. Moore) but it was, after all, the mother of two of his children's story. Hopkins is so letter-perfect he takes your breath away. Loud, brash, vain, arrogant, silly, clowning, crying, painting, loving, he is totally Picasso. When film historians look back at Sir Anthony's career (50 years from now) they will agree that this film was his best.

Alas, I was SO disappointed because the color and sound quality of the DVD format is POOR! There is NO EXCUSE for crappy color and sound quality in this day and age!!!!

And there are NO SUBTITLES/CLOSE-CAPTIONS!!!!!! Again, in this day and age, not having subtitles, or close-captioning at the very least is RIDICULOUS!!!!!! It is insensitive to the deaf and hard of hearing community (many of the latter of which are us aging baby-boomers, so it is age-insensitive as well).

Fortunately, I still have the VHS and will keep that so I can view this wonderful movie on a BETTER QUALITY, though out-dated, format...at least until the tape pops...

851768,5,6304372396,"""Surviving Picasso"" (1996) is directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant, the same two who gave us ""Howard's End"". This story tells of Picasso's (Anthony Hopkins) relationship with his mistress Francoise Gilot (Natasha McElhone), who was the mother to two of Picasso's children. The movie also introduces us to a number of the other women who encircled Picasso's life during the time of their relationship, including Olga Picasso (Jane Lapotaire), Dora Maar (Julianne Moore), Marie-theses Walter(Susannah Harker), and Jacquueline Rogue (Diane Verona), and some of his artist friends, such as Henri Matisse. The movie is an intimate and believable account of Picasso's life right down to details of the artist's paintings and the moments where he is creating his works of art. The producers may have had a great deal of trouble getting any rights to show Picasso's paintings but it doesn't show except for the fact that his more famous works are not illustrated. Great care was taken to show believable works of art as well as the artist's studio and life.

This 2010 dvd disc is coded NTSC and so is playable on North American dvd players and looks very good. There are however no special features, not even a commentary for the film. The movie is loosely based on the biography ""Picasso: Creator and Destroyer"" by Arianna Huington.",1281484800,42,1345,5.031390134529148

The art is fantastic, even though I don't really like his style, and the love affair is touching. Watching this movie is a great way to gain appreciation for the man's life, or annoyance if you look at Picasso's ego and how it effected women. It ended far to early in Picasso's career but thus is the story being told. Great movie of art and an artist.",1272844800,,534,4.459183673469388

wrote an autobiography. Just because someone is a great singer, actor or painter
certainly doesn't mean they are going to be a nice person.
And ex-wives mostly don't paint their husbands as angels?
I have seen several of these movies about famous painters/ artists.
There seems to be one theme in common:
they are strangely driven people
who see the world through a different window
than ordinary people.
Many are manic  in their intensity and mood swings.
Picasso was a crowd pleaser who just was more than all
for Picasso. Anthony Hopkins even tried to get that intensity in his eyes that
Picasso was known for: that glow.
There is little doubt that men
 like Escher and Picasso have left us looking at the world differently.",1250121600,,785,4.764705882352941

I don't understand why people wanted this movie to explain Picasso as a person...the title tell you its about someone who SURVIVED Picasso. This man didn't want to be understood. He didn't care about that so appreciate this movie for what it is, a great example of how someone can almost be 'swallowed' whole by another larger than life figure but who is able to transcend all that and stand on their own in the end. This movie has so many great aspects to it outside of the acting so I urge people to give this movie a chance because it is a fantastic journey from beginning to end.",1189382400,2,827,4.3076923076923075
851816,5,6304372396,"Wonderful film, outstanding performances on behalf of all actors and actresses, including Sir Anthony Hopkins. His looks and mannerism was so perfect that I forgot at times that I was not watching ""Picasso in action"".

While many facts shown in this movie are based on truth, we must not forget that the script was based on the novel by Arianna Huffington, who dared (in order to make a name for herself) interpreting Picasso's life by adding a heavy feminist slant. Yes, Picasso was eccentric as an artist and as a man, he was a Spaniard, born in 1881, in the most southern region of Spain (Andalusia) which was under Arab rule for centuries. Understandably, the mentality of a male of his generation is beyond Ms. Huffingtons' comprehention. But nevertheless, even though somewhat distorted by her overly feministic interpretation, ""Surviving Picasso"" it is an excellent, entertaining and historically speaking, worthwhile movie.",1148688000,5,931,5.206666666666667

I disagree with some of the other reviewers- I think Hopkins did a great job at inhabiting Picasso's spirit.  Did the film ""explain"" him?  No- but Picasso was such an elusive  complicated man, it's not entirely surprising.  As when Hopkins did Nixon- sure, you don't totally forget it's Anthony Hopkins- but as with his Nixon, Hopkins is mezmorizing here.  Hopkins said after playing men like in Remains of the Day who were basically dead from the waist down, he relished the opportunity to play a man who was completely alive- and his joy here is apparent.  Beside Hopkins, Natascha McElhone is very intriguing, as are the rest of the supporting cast and the Parisian and Spanish locations.  It's a Merchant Ivory piece fer cryin out loud- you KNOW the production values are always going to be rock solid.  We'd like a DVD please!",1142294400,22,965,4.696428571428571

He was just as believable as President Nixon in ""Nixon"", as he was a madman in ""Silence Of The Lambs"".  Here again, he does not dissapoint me.  The movie is dark, and I would tend not to agree with the accuracy of the historical aspects of the film, but I did find Hopkins to be a compelling Picasso.  And, yes once again, I found myself watching Pablo Picasso.  I enjoy biographies of painters and creative souls, and I would be hard pressed to find a biography that is uplifting and has a happy ending.  I found the same in ""Surviving Picasso"".  It is a little long in the tooth, but I found the cinematography to be beautiful and again, Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance is beautiful.
