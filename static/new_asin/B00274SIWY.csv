8606520,5,B00274SIWY,"This is a great movie based on a real incident that happened in the early 80s in New Bedford Massachusetts at Big Dans Tavern on Bellevile Avenue,its not downtown but it runs parallel with Achushunet Ave. and Ashley Blvd. and about 1.5 miles to downtown ,,the tavern is long gone. I llive here and was about 14 when it happened,i remember it on the front page of news paper and people talking about it,this movie follows all the events of the rape and how it happenenned based on witness testimony right through the court trials and outcome,,,,so if the movie lags in some areas,its because it really happened that way.",1332460800,,619,4.636363636363637
