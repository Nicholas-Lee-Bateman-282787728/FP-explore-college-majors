English dubbing has never been a big issue with me as it has with others and refuse to watch English dubbed movies.  However, the actors are just terrible actors in the way they perform the actions.  The actors look like it was their first time doing kung-fu fights.  That's what I meant by bad acting.  Jackie Chan is a horrible actor in terms of speaking but makes up for it with his actual actions which bring comedy and a sort of charisma to the big screen.  Well the actor's performance looked like they never did on-screen fight scenes and they looked like they were doing a theatrical play fight every single time.  Yes it was that bad.
Secondly it was bad because of the terrible fight coreography.  The fight scenes were just plain dumb.  I have no problems with people flying and walking on the walls and the water and doing neat tricks that defy logic and whatever magic they throw onscreen.  That stuff makes kung-fu fighting on the big screen a pleasure to watch.  However, the directing was so horrible the flying stunts show the person jerking in the air as if you knew they were flying and hanging by an invisible string.  Again it looked like theatrical directing on stage.  To the people who made this bad film, this is not a theater!  It looks sloppy when you do that junk.
Thirdly, the storyline and directing from scene to scene was very sloppy and choppy.  One minute the guy falls off a cliff the next he meets his master and is crying because he's lost use of his arms and legs then next he hobbles into battle with bionic arms and legs that shoot off.  Oh yes it's that terrible.  Yes I have no problem with laughing at outrageous stuff that shows up in a kung-fu flick and some of the silly lines they throw out.  But come on it looked really sloppy.  I have no problem laughing at, it but it wasn't intentionally done to make people laugh.  For example, Ricky-Oh has to be the most outrageous kung-fu flick ever made.  Where the leader boss turns into an ogre that looks like a plastic badly done oversized rubbermaid giant.  Now that's just knock-your-socks off hilarious.  It was consistently throughout the film where it was badly done to make you laugh and go wow what next?!  But this was amateurishly done and just poor directing.
The storyline follows a normal path.  Where a clan robs a merchant transporting gold to the goverment with well armed guards.  Another part of the clan knows about the robbing and the leader goes and takes the gold to do a good deed and send it back to the goverment and then ask for forgiveness to his clanmates so that everything will return to normal.  However, the leader who robbed the gold does not appreciate this and kills his backstabs him and tells the government that his clanmate leader robbed the gold.  Naturally he has the stash at his house and is in the process of returning it and gets taken to jail.  While the leader is in jail his family is killed by the robbers.  And of course you know by now he meets a few friends when he escapes from jail and seeks revenge.  Revenge is a common theme in these movies.  Oddly enough the actors are actually good looking esp. the females.
