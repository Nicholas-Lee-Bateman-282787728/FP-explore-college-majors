The true insight of what the scenery might look like during a childs imaginary game they play.  I have a 7 year old now and he first watched the movie when he was 4 and has loved it ever since.",1152489600,6,346,3.9

Having seen Tim in concert at my school, and at other functions, I can say that this man is one of the best creative musicians in the past 20 years. His messages to children are inspiring and magical.",994896000,4,343,4.375
926017,5,6304749287,"If you knew enough of the title to get here, you know enough already to buy it.  If you've only stumbled across this video and are curious, let me try to help.  I originally taped this off of TV 13 or 14 years ago and my 4 children watched the tape so many times over the years that the video is quite distorted.  But the audio is still quite good and I catch them from time to time still playing it.  Not only did we all have a great time watching this together but it opened up the door to hours of fun and adventure after the tape was done.  Now that I've found it, I'm buying a copy for my family so we can re-visit all those wonderful memories.  I'm also buying three other copies to give to other family members that now have small children.  I'm hoping it brings them (and you) as much fun as it brought to us.",973468800,17,817,4.006172839506172

926509,5,6304749287,"This movie saved Christmas. My nephew was irritable - he didn't nap that afternoon. His father, my brother, was even more uptight, constantly expecting the worst. That's when I decided to put on the Wow Wow Wibble Woggle Wazzie Woodle Woo DVD I happened to bring. My brother and I are a little old for this, but we weren't when we first saw it on cable in the late 80s. We taped it then, and wore the VHS out. Instantly my nephew was spellbound by the music and surprising visuals. He was spellbound! Didn't take long before his father followed suit, as each successive scene sparked our memories and reminded us about all the great stuff that was coming up.

Before we put on the Wazzie Woodle this Christmas, there was a lot of tension in the air, but this charming and lovely film never fails to lighten our hearts and spirits. I'm grateful to have had a chance to buy this DVD and share this amazing video with my family's next generation.",1419552000,,943,4.4508670520231215

I remember my brother and I used to love watching it. We knew it word for word and scene for scene forward and backwards. I look forward to showing it to my own kids one day, and I'm pretty sure they will love it as much as we did( still do).

Tim Noah did a excellent job in this under rated family  classic.

And I would like to thank HBO for being smart enough to play it( the one or two times that they did) back in the day

Much LOVE

I just found the DVD at the library, and, even though my daughter is only 2 1/2, I checked it out. I was worried that it might be too old for her, or maybe a little scary, with the ""monsters"" in it. But she keeps asking for the ""Wibble Wobble show"" and loves it! Sometimes she acts a little scared, but she comes and sits on my lap and is fine. And the songs are still as familiar to me as they were th*cough*ty years ago! Like putting on a comfy shirt. Such great, catchy songs, and a great message about friendship and the power of imagination.",1296864000,,739,3.966442953020134
