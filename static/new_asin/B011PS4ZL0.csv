The transfers are great compared to most Millcreek Entertainment bulk releases",1517270400,,164,5.111111111111111

8724836,1,B011PS4ZL0,"This is easily one of the worst DVD releases of the year.  The ONLY positive is that 8.99 is a good value for 10 low budget schlock films that to many of us are entertaining..but it just is NOT worth it as the PQ is just horrendous, just awful awful awful !

**The 3 DVDs are in a case that are stacked on top of each other, there is one center hub for all 3 discs to sit on top of each other to add to the cheapness of this set**

Most of you reading have either seen the movies, and if not there are many reviews and thoughts about them already. So Ill be posting if these are upgrades are what not. This release on the surface is more like *get this DVD if you don't have other releases for these movies* but right now Im thinking avoid at all costs. I really can NOT recommend this to anyone

Attack of the Giant Leeches - AWFUL PQ the pits, Alpha Video is better and thats saying something - one star if that, it was un-watchable - a blurry widescreen dark murky print with some mild judder and combing. No effort was done to improve it. This was a HUGE disappointment. Get the Marengo Films DVD instead, that's the best release in terms of PQ, and also has A Bucket of Blood !

The Wasp Woman - this was also widescreen and was happy with the PQ on this, I thought this looked better than the Elite Entertainment release...but not by much

The Killer Shrews - the Film Detective DVD looks better

Teenagers from Outer Space - Image wins again here. Mill Creek should be ashamed of themselves, it *looks* like the same print BUT there is murkiness and judder when the characters move/combing, I watched the first 3 minutes of this movie - that's all I could handle.. Just another pathetic effort

Giant Gila Monster - Legend Films DVD is far superior

The Brain That Wouldnt Die (useless to this set as  Shout Factory is releasing this on blu ray ) - Synapse and Timeless Media releases on DVD are better
Phantom of 10,000 Leagues (useless to this set as Kino is releasing this on blu ray) - keep your MGM DVD if you're not getting the bluray
Eegah - no better or worse than anything else
Night Fright - no better or worse than anything else - including Alpha Video
Invasion of the Bee Girls - keep the MGM DVD

In all honesty I would just AVOID and PASS on this release because the PQ on what Ive seen is awful and some of the other titles are coming on blu ray or have better DVD releases. Save your money. This is NOT an upgrade to any of the titles you might already own. I just cant believe in 2015, Mill Creek would release something this awful. This was a complete waste of time for Mill Creek- why they even bothered with this is way beyond me.",1442448000,19,2657,4.200392927308448
8724837,5,B011PS4ZL0,"ATTACK OF THE KILLER Bs Is the perfect schlock-horror starter pack! It contains 10 of the best examples of public domain mania! PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES is about a hilarious-looking sea monster, not unlike a papier mache dragon, terrorizing the unwary. Watching the title creature flounder around in the water is awesomeness itself! ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES features grown men in trash bag leech costumes, feasting on local hillbillies! Fortunately, it also features Yvette Vickers (ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN) in the blazing role of her career! THE GIANT GILA MONSTER- Don Sullivan (TEENAGE ZOMBIES) and his gang of hot-rodders must save their town from the lumbering lizard! Beware the shocking ""banjo-lele"" musical sequence! THE KILLER SHREWS- James Best arrives on an island, where scientists have developed hideous, mutant shrews (actually, dogs in shrew outfits)! Who will survive these fang-y fiends?! TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE- 30 year old, extraterrestrial ""teens"" come to Earth, in order to harvest humans for,,, wait for it... their hordes of gigantic land lobsters! And they roar like elephants!! WASP WOMAN stars the beautiful Susan Cabot as an aging cosmetics magnate, unable to cope w/ getting older. She employs a mad scientist who has developed a serum made from queen wasp jelly. She uses it, and terror ensues! Watch for her fashionable wasp woman claw gloves! THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE- A woman literally loses her head in a car accident. Thankfully, her mad scientist husband (Jason Evers) has developed a way to keep her head alive long enough to find her a new, improved body! Virginia Leith plays the head in the pan w/ the snow-white tan! Watch for her mutant friend in the closet! EEGAH! brings us a giant caveman, on the loose in the desert! Can Arch Hall jr. and Marilyn Manning (THE SADIST) bring him under control without too much of Hall's weep-y, crooner caterwauling?! Not a chance! NIGHT FRIGHT finds sheriff John Agar investigating the brutal deaths of some more 30-something ""teenagers"", after an alien crash-lands on the outskirts of town! Memorably dull. INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS- Anitra Ford (MESSIAH OF EVIL) and her band of BEE GIRLS, complete w/ giant sunglasses, decide to annihilate the males of our species by... er, loving them to death! The ""naked-marshmallow-cream-induction-ceremony"" scene is one for the ages! Well, there you have it. For the sake of all that is holy, what are you waiting for?!...",1440201600,9,2459,5.089108910891089
