2023350,4,B0001P1B3O,"This was one of the later film versions of an Alister Maclean novel, and is a tidy little thriller with little time wasted.

Anthony Hopkins plays a secret service agent tasked with solving the pirating of millions of pounds of gold bullion in the North Sea.  This search takes him to remote locations in the Hebrides, unravelling the secrets of a small town where people and yachts have been disappearing.  Being an Alister Maclean novel, nothing and nobody is what they at first appear - the usual ingredients are present and correct - the femme fatale, the damsel in distress, the double crossing, the dour and unstoppable agent... even Maclean's dry sense of humour, which often gets lost in the translation to the big screen, comes through - probably as a result of Maclean writing the screenplay from his novel.

The pace of the film is perfect, with a running time of 90 minutes not leaving you feel the film has outstayed its welcome.  The actions scenes are fine, if a little outdated.. the scenes skulking around the castle even reminded me of possibly my favourite Maclean movie - Where Eagles Dare (the actor who played the castle Kommandant, General Rosemeyer,  is also in this movie, making another link).  Music is pretty good for a 70's score, with a brash theme that crops up anytime our hero is running or flying around - which is a significant part of the time.. it's the sort of music which would not have been out of place in an episode of `The Professionals'.  Another piece of inter-movie trivia - the stunts for the movie were done by Vic Armstrong and Bob Simmons, both Bond movie veterans.  Watching this movie, one can almost imagine Hopkins playing Bond.

Hopkins plays the cynical Maclean hero well, with the right does of dry humour - and is ably backed up by a great character actor cast - Robert Morley basically plays a more comic version of `M' from the earlier Bond movies, Jack Hawkins has little screen time as Sir Anthony Skouros, and is even voiced over (by Charles Gray, who also appeared in two Bond movies - `Diamonds are forever' and `You only live twice') as he had a voice box owing to his throat cancer.  Nathalie Delon plays the femme fatale role adequately - as far as I can tell, this was one of the few times she appeared in an English speaking role.

All in all, a refreshingly taut little thriller which hits the right notes, and has not dated too badly. A cut above other thrillers of its time, recommended for any fans of Maclean or 70's thrillers in general, but not one of his most best movie adaptations.",1170460800,13,2561,4.592105263157895
2023351,5,B0001P1B3O,"Ask your standard movie fan which Alistair MacLean adaptation they prefer and the vote would most likely be split between THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and WHERE EAGLES DARE, but, whilst I absolutely love the latter of those two, my personal favorite has been for many years WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL - a spy thriller penned by MacLean in the late 1960s and filmed with Anthony Hopkins in the lead role in 1971.
I saw the movie many years ago on British television and always longed to see it once more. My prayers were answered when it was finally announced for DVD release in Region 2. Armed with a new region-free DVD player, I ordered it and anxiously checked my Maryland mailbox every day until its arrival. UPDATE - Kino Lorber have announced this movie is to be released in the US in 2016 on both DVD and Blu-ray - I am over the moon with excitement.
Watching it once again after all these years my passion for this action adventure is unfailing, I consider this to be the best spy thriller that [Bond producers] EON Productions NEVER made.
With a simply superb cast that sees Hopkins joined by Robert Morley (as a rather snobbish boss) and Jack Hawkins (as a suspicious millionaire) this movie is simply brimming over with ""Bondian"" elements that include beautiful girls (bad and good), thrilling action, underwater battles, building suspense and a roaring soundtrack. It's the most entertaining couple of hours of spy thriller action that I have had the opportunity to enjoy in almost two decades.
Hopkins plays secret agent Calvert who travels to the coast of Scotland disguised as a marine biologist to investigate the disappearance of bullion ships in the Irish Sea. There he encounters a colorful array of characters, both friend and foe before a climactic battle in an underground boathouse.
The Region 2 DVD sports a fine transfer with only the theatrical trailer as a special feature. Still it is very entertaining and well worth putting your hard earned cash for. I simply cannot recommend it strongly enough.",1138838400,39,2013,4.804034582132565

2023362,3,B0001P1B3O,"Alistair MacLean's  ""When Eight Bells Toll"" was an attempt to create another Bond franchise. Directed by Etienne P&eacute;rier, the film benefits from a witty script and a fun performance by Robert Morley but suffers from pedestrian direction lacked the energy of the later Bond films. Anthony Hopkins makes a credible hero but his reserved manner doesn't exactly make him all that appealing.

Hopkins plays British Treasury agent Phillip Calvert. Calvert is sent by Sir Arthur (Morley) to discover what has happened to a British ship that disappeared off the coast of Scotland without a trace. Calvert and his partner (Corin Redgrave) encounter unfriendly locals along the way. Featuring Jack Hawkins (voiced by Charles Gray--Hawkins had throat cancer at the time of shooting).

Shot for $ 7 million U.S., the film did well in Europe but tanked in America and, with the film just covering its budget, plans for further sequels were abandoned. The film looks like it cost less than $ 7 million to my eyes--very little of the budget ended up on the screen and, aside from one or two spectacular shots and set pieces, the film truly lacks the scale to sell this thriller to an audience weened on the Bond thrillers. This could easily pass for an average episode of ""The Avengers"" or ""Secret Agent Man"" (aka ""Danger Man"") if not for those few set pieces.

This restoration by Pinewood Studios produces a nice looking transfer. The film looks soft but that has more to do with the intended look of the film. Detail and color appear solid throughout although the contrasts appears a bit off to me at times (it looks a bit too bright). This isn't a huge upgrade compared to the DVD but it is an improvement with better depth and detail. The contrast appeared a bit too bright for my taste in this restoration. I have no idea how the film looked back in the day and, beyond the DVD, have nothing to compare it to for reference.

The only flaws I noticed was occasional like speckling and the interpositive used for this transfer is in pretty good shape.

The audio sounded a bit lackluster to me although dialog remains clear throughout the film. The mono sound track appears a bit cluttered to me although, again, it probably represents the sound of the original mono sound track.

Sadly we don't get any special features just the original trailer for the film. It would have been nice to get a retrospective featurette on the making of the film and the circumstances around the making of the film. I'm sure that the UK will probably get some additional special features. I would loved to hear Hopkins thoughts on the film 45 years later.

The witty script and performance of Morley won me over (Hopkins was fine but the role cries out for a less reserved performance) and the film remains entertaining but it doesn't quite scale the heights of the Bond films lacking a colorful villian and the small scale of the film certainly does the film no favors as well.

An entertaining if a bit underwhelming spy thriller, ""When Eight Bells Toll"" benefits from a witty script, fun performance from Robert Morley and a solid if stolid performance from Anthony Hopkins as the hero, it's nice to see this largely forgotten thriller receive a nice high def transfer.",1458432000,,3249,4.74645390070922
2023363,5,B0001P1B3O,"Having read a very glowing review here on Amazon and having loved The Guns of Navarone (Gregory Peck/David Niven/Bobby Daren/Anthony Quinn), I was strongly urged to find a copy of this film. Alas, only Region 2 copies existed that I could find. Then I got an E-mail from Amazon about forthcoming releases, and lo and behold this very flick is on display. And on Blu-ray, no less!

Finally got around to watching this with my dad after awaiting its release for a while, and very glad I saw it. The film is indeed very Bond-like, and it doesn't do a bad job of it, with Hopkins giving a solid performance as a roguish investigative spy and Morley his superior (and Morley will make you think he's the inspiration for Vernon Dursley in so many ways).

The location shots are really something, with great views of the Scottish coast (including some wonderful views of these impressive cliffs) and some castle scenes, and even a diving sequence into a sunken vessel.

The action itself is solid, getting your attention right from the start with Hopkins infiltrating a ship via its anchor chain only to seemingly be caught. Was it just a training exercise? A betrayal? Or worse? You don't really think it's everything it may seem like until a key turn of events much later, but what happens in the first several minutes of the film are actually important clues. For an espionage film, Eight Bells knows how to work the system, and that's par for the course for Alistair MacLean.

Overall, this is a must-see picture. It shows the earlier portion of an award-winning actor's career, was crafted by one of the best storytellers whose films I've seen, and it holds its own in a realm ruled by 007.

Arguably the only weakness is a lack of extras: the Blu-ray contains only a series of trailers, for this film and several others (Juggernaut, The Satan Bug, The File of the Golden Goose). I assure you the transfer quality is superb, as expected of a Kino Lorber release.",1458345600,4,1960,4.6531791907514455
2023364,4,B0001P1B3O,"I rather liked this 1971 adaptation of one of the best books by Alistair MacLean, even if it is DEFINITELY inferior to the novel. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

WARNING: this is a Region 2 PAL DVD. It will not play on standard US Region 1 NTSC equipment.

The film begins mostly like the novel. In a dark night an unknown man in diving suit climbs onboard an unknown ship and clearly looks for something - he will find dead bodies and trouble. We will later learn that his name is Philip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) and he works for British government. He and his colleague Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) are on a mission in a remote, quite poor and rough part of Scotland. Posing as marine biologists and operating from a small but fast yacht they are after a gang of particularly nasty, extremely well organised and terminally ruthless characters, who are stealing government money - a LOT of it. The bad guys play for keeps, they play hard, they play dirty, they kill easily, they make few mistakes and especially they HIDE REALLY, REALLY WELL. I will not go here in details to avoid spoilers, but the bad guys in this film are a real piece of work and for once in action thrillers they are actually not totally stupid. I will say no more about the story.

I always liked Alistair MacLean books a lot. For my personal taste ""Fear is the key"" is his absolute masterpiece and I count it as one of my most favourite thriller books. ""Night without end"", an absolutely amazing book, is almost as good. Of course everybody knows his WWII bestsellers ""Guns of Navarone"" and ""Where eagles dare"", if only by cinema adaptations. I also always liked ""Puppet on the chain"", possibly the most brutal and cruel of his books.

""When eight bells toll"" is also an excellent read - in fact I rate it as number 3 of MacLean's books, immediately after ""Fear is the key"" and ""Night without end"". I would actually advise to read the book BEFORE watching the film because the novel is better and also, because without reading the book you might be a little bit confused by the plot...

In the film changes were made, which were not entirely successful. The main female character, Charlotte Skouras (Natalie Delon) is quite different here, definitely younger and more sexy and playing a very different game than in the book. The ending is also quite different and frankly, the last five minutes don't make much sense. One of the main villains, the infamous sadistic ""like to kill in most personal way"" Quinn (Oliver Mac Greevy), albeit still very menacing on the screen, is nevertheless only a shadow of the bone-freezing terror he was in the book (in the novel Calvert was actually TERRIFIED even when looking at this man). Unlike in the book, Hunslett is a kind of light-weight. Finally, the secondary female character Sue Kirkside was made much too tame - in the book she was much more assertive and nastier (albeit cute).

On another hand anthony Hopkins played Calvert exactly as I always imagined him. Calvert's boss, ""Uncle"" Arthur (Robert Morley), is a delight, exactly as in the novel. Severe beauty of Scottish seashore is a major asset. Finally, we can see here Ferdy Mayne, who for me will be forever Count von Krolock from ""Fearless Vampire Killers"", playing Lavorski, a seriously dangerous villain (it is hardly a spoiler - one look at Lavorski and you will immediately realise that this is ZE BAD GUY). Finally, action scenes are so delightfully late 60s, reminding of early 007 movies.

If it remained closer to the book this could have been a better film but it is still a quite watchable thing. A recommended viewing for all Alistair Maclean's afficionados, but probably mostly for them - or, should I rather say, us...",1445990400,,3738,4.689024390243903

The good news is we get to see Robert Morley, being Robert Morley.  The bad news is Anthony Hopkins attempting to act his way through a terrible script.

Notable for having a young Anthony Hopkins in the lead, along with Jack Hawkins and Robert Morley. Pretty close to zero chemistry with the love interest and juvenile plot twists. At least we get to see the Scottish shoreline courtesy of helicopter flyovers. Comparing Ian Fleming's 007 movie series to Coca-Cola, this movie is a flat Pepsi in its failed attempt to reproduce a beloved formula.

The first and only other time I had seen this movie was in a movie theater when I was a child. I saw it for the second time recently to see how my perspective of the movie had changed.

Some people here did not like it but I think they just did not know what to expect.  Great actors and tight plot.  Even had the fake second engine in the boat that was in the book.  Prime and amazon bring back oldies that I really love.  Special effects are ok but these days seem to put so much emphasis on them that it lessons the plot.

2023415,5,B0001P1B3O,"This 1971 movie, directed by Etienne Prier is based on a novel by Alistair Maclean, who also wrote the screenplay. It is an exciting, action-packed story about a cargo ship full of gold bullion that disappears off the coast of Scotland near the town of Torbay: and it is not the first. Naval Commander Philip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) together with intelligence expert Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) concoct a plan to try to locate exactly where the vessels go missing. They place two agents under the direction of a senior official known only as `Uncle Arthur' (Robert Morley) undercover on one of the bullion ships so that they can radio back information. However, when Calvert drops in to investigate their radio silence, he discovers that they are both dead. Suspicion falls on a vessel in the area under the ownership of a Greek shipping magnate called Skouras (Jack Hawkins) who claims to have a lovely young second wife Charlotte (Nathalie Delon). But Skouras and Charlotte are clearly under the control of Lavorski (Ferdy Maine). A number of people have disappeared locally over the preceding months and this adds to the mystery that Calvert must investigate. The drama of the film is enhanced considerably by the incidental music composed by English bandleader Wally Stott.",1376870400,4,1277,5.056872037914692

So the way around it is to play via a computer which plays it just fine.

2023417,5,B0001P1B3O,Glad that WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL finally got released. I remember seeing this in the cinema years ago. It was a great thriller and a solid film all the way. Very nostalgic in many ways. Very gripping in every respect. This is one of the last of Alistair MacLean's great stories to come to the screen. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances. One thing that really stood out was Arthur Ibbetson's very beautiful and almost thought provoking cinematography. One of the greats.,1366243200,,484,4.773809523809524
2023418,4,B0001P1B3O,"Alistair Maclean's 1966 thriller ""When Eight Bells Toll"" gets the cinematic treatment in this 1971 British effort, now available on DVD in the UK and US (this particular DVD is the UK version).  Maclean did the screenplay, adapting loosely but effectively from his novel.  A young Anthony Hopkins is worth watching as a ruthless British agent battling a nasty and ruthless gang of gold bullion thieves in the Scottish Highlands.

As the story opens, Naval officer and secret agent Philip Calvert (Hopkins) boards a hijacked ship, only to find his fellow agents murdered on board.  Calvert himself barely escapes with his life, after a struggle with one of the bullion thieves.  Calvert will find himself on notice with his boss, hunted by the gold thieves, and struggling to make sense of the case.  A helicopter flight around the Western Highlands will solidify his suspicions but place him in mortal danger.  Calvert's relentless pursuit of the thieves will lead to a dramatic final showdown.

The action sequences in this movie are pretty good, the more so for not looking like staged martial arts exhibitions.  The underwater scenes, especially one in which a leading character is trapped underwater, are quite effective.  The location shooting in Scotland is terrific.  Fans of the novel are duly warned that Maclean altered the way some of the leading characters are played between the book and the movie, and the ending plays out a little differently.  ""When Eight Bells Toll"" is a decent movie, and practically a 70's period piece; recommended.",1356912000,3,1552,5.066929133858268
2023419,4,B0001P1B3O,"Scottish author Alistair MacLean (1922-87) specialized in tales of adventure and suspense, and with MacLean himself responsible for the screenplay, When Eight Bells Toll (1971) is one of the better screen adaptations of his books.  The movie does a nice job of capturing the atmosphere of the novel, and the spirit of the characters, while spicing up the ending for a more exciting and cinematic finish.

Typical for MacLean, what is happening is shrouded in some mystery, which unfolds as Treasury agent Philip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) conducts an investigation into the happenings along the Scottish coast, where a number of ships carrying shipments of gold bullion have mysteriously vanished.  Eventually his attention is centered on shipping tycoon Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), and his yacht the Shangri-La.

Also operating from a boat, Calvert gets his orders via radio from Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones (aka ""Uncle Arthur"") who is played with great gusto by Robert Morley.  Calvert gains valuable information while checking the coastline in a helicopter, but is nearly killed when the chopper is shot down, and slides into the sea.  Managing to get back to his ship, Calvert is joined by Uncle Arthur, and later by Skouras' wife Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), who says that her husband has been associating with undesirable types, and has plans to stop Calvert.

Featuring settings with mostly overcast skies, When Eight Bells Toll has a moist and dreary atmosphere.  Calvert operates similar to James Bond, and the film includes a number of nicely executed action scenes, including some which are undersea.  A community wide deception, which is at the heart of the matter, is a bit of a stretch, but it seems to play rather smoothly, as does the recruitment of local fisherman to help in the cause.

Anthony Hopkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/6305050058/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Edge/dp/B0038Z5SEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Edge</a>) does an excellent job of carrying the film.  Calvert is extremely resourceful, and capable of great ruthlessness, repeatedly killing in cold blood without hesitation.  Hopkins pulls it off well, without seeming fake or overly smug.  Hardly known as a man of action, Robert Morley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Theater-of-Blood/dp/B00006JY23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Theater of Blood</a>) is nonetheless very convincing, as a desk jockey who battles seasickness, and rises to the occasion, when pressed into frontline service.

Staying fairly true to the source material, this effort should appeal to most MacLean fans, and is also a solid recommendation to those looking for some 70's style intrigue and adventure.  Unfortunately the film is not yet available on Region 1 DVD.  Image quality of the 2011 Region 2 PAL release by JL Entertainment is good, although color saturation seems a bit light.  There are no extras except a trailer, but the film is subtitled in English.",1349827200,3,3142,5.87032967032967

8015895,2,B0001P1B3O,"I've been a fan of espionage films over the years, and I'm always seeking out ones that I've missed - both in their initial theatrical screenings and subsequent video releases.  What gave me an additional interest in acquiring this video is that it's based on a novel by,  and has a screenplay by one of my favorite authors, Alistair MacLean.  I haven't yet read the original novel, and I can only imagine that it's an improvement upon this rather tepid spy thriller.  To it's credit, KINO LORBER Video  has given us an excellent HD restoration of this 1971 film. The movie is correctly shown in its original 2.35:1 Anamorphic  presentation. The audio is very good and I'm happy with the look of the film.
 As to the content, that's a different story. The wonderful poster artwork on the case of the DVD is familiar to me when I saw the original poster years ago. I always thought , from initial viewing, that at some part of the film , there would be some volcanic explosion on an island with the hero and the girl  escaping with their very lives while dangling from a rope ladder connected to a rising helicopter.  SPOILERS : Upon viewing the film you find out: 1.  There is no volcano, or an island involved. 2.  There is a helicopter scene early on, but only upon which Anthony Hopkins is flying over an area searching for a hidden alcove or something 3.  There is no sexy, mini-skirted babe with a pistol helping out Anthony Hopkins - as a matter of fact, the main female costar is a rich, bored and generally useless character who you could care less what happens to her.  Actually, considering the fact that she's connected with the bad guys and who's  betrayal of our heroes and company puts them in great jeopardy, she should've been killed, but instead is  is let go-with a bit of the treasure!- by a very lenient Anthony Hopkins.  This last part was puzzling to me, but then no one asked me in the first place.  There's many more inconsistencies in the story which I won't go into, but one last comment on this disappointing movie - the music score , by ""Walter Stott"" (aka sex-transgendered Angela Morley) is absolutely terrible. The music gets louder and soaring at the most inappropriate, mundane scenes in the movie.  It makes me wonder if she/he even looked at the film that  she/he was scoring or rather she/he  just threw together a tape of music and send it off to the film producer to include in this uneven movie. All in all I can't recommend this video,  unless you already seen it and have a particular affection for it. Again, I'd like to emphasize that the video of this film is done very well -  perhaps too well, considering the source material.",1474416000,7,2672,4.534446764091858
