Each runs a little under an hour, has HiFi audio and is of fine quality. Narration provides only general information about what's on screen.

Volume #1, Golden Age of Comedy - 1920s - 1930s consists primarily of silent era film clips. A few of these are badly worn and have multiple scratch lines. All are projected at 24 fps, which causes the action on screen to be exaggeratedly fast (18 fps was a standard speed for silents, with some run even slower). There's a few rarities here, however most selections are taken from widely available shorts.
