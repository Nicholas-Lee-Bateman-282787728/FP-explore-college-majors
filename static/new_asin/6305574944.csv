1054400,5,6305574944,"This is an outstanding comedy.  Which is funny on so many levels.  There are jokes you don't get the 1st time through.  Saw it with friends and we found ourselves laughing at jokes the rest of the movie audience wasn't  getting!  Had this movie been promoted as much as Rushmore, (which came out  at nearly the same time but is not half as funny) it would have done  incredible business.",939081600,,387,4.442857142857143
1054401,4,6305574944,"Who would have thunk that MTV would have actually realesed something worth watching?  ELECTION is a great comedy with hilarious performances, especially by Ms. Reese Witherspoon, who really shows actual talent that  goes far beyond the classic teen-move genre that I recognized her from.  (okay, so Pleasentville wasn't really a teen movie, but she played a rather  stereotypical teen part, didn't she?)  Matthew Broderick gives his best  performance to date as a disgruntled teacher who goes out of his way to  ruin the ever positive Tracy Flick (Mr. Witherspoon).
The political  jabs in the film are obvious, and even exagerated:  The back-stabbing, sex  obsession, morally (or is it ethically?) corruption that is center in  everything political, revenge, spite...the list goes on.  This is truly a  great movie, one of the best of 1999.  MTV should be proud of doing  something right for a change by letting us see this pick flick.  Now let's  hope they keep it up...but they probably won't!",938649600,3,995,5.080745341614906
1054402,5,6305574944,"ELECTION is absolutley terrific. It is so much funnier and smarter than say, AMERICAN PIE. You have to at least rent ELECTION if you don't end up buying it here! The film is brilliant.",935539200,,184,4.4411764705882355
1054498,1,6305574944,"I usually find Roger Ebert to have solid movie reviews (considering he pretty much wrote the book on movie reviews) but all if that gets negated the moment Mtv productions slap their name on a film. Within the first 12 minutes, you can count on the vulgar, gut-punch verbiage that seems entirely out of place and unnecessary. Ebert's review states that Broderick nails his performance, and Witherspoon ""hits her stride"" with this lead and I would like to believe that; however, watching it through the lens of a 2017 moviegoer, where illicit student-teacher relationships are so often news fodder, is what makes this particular relationship so unpaletable. Because we've seen it before. So, what might have been an intent to shock viewers into believing it to be a one-off occurrence simply because of the nature of Witherspoon's lead comes off as smarmy and tasteless. Although, as Ebert notes, the director isn't so much story telling as he is making a commentary on elections in general. So, I guess if you want to relive the 2016 presidential election, then this movie is for you.",1499904000,,1084,4.9289617486338795

1054507,5,6305574944,"Most movies are about something, such as love, revenge, ambition or infidelity and they build the story to make a point about their theme.  Election amazingly is about all those things and much, much more.

I would not even rate this as a teen flick because of the sex and story line, and I am not a prude. For me unnecessary sex scenes detract from a movie, but there is at least one very mild scene where two girl are kissing and that was not bad, and I am glad to see it in a film this old. It was a little slice of reality in an otherwise bad movie. Not many mainstream movies from this time even explored or even showed lesbian relationships. Well at least in the movies I have seen. The teacher/student sex should have been dropped out. I can't believe that Matthew Broderick and Reece Witherspoon even agreed to appear in this movie. All in all a really bad movie!

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a young Hillary Clinton - smart, hard working, blonde, political - and therefore dangerous, right? Let the schlubby cheating school teacher (Matthew Broderick) come save us from ourselves! The worst she does is tear down some posters - obviously in a fit of anger, hey, she's a teen. Oh, and she has an ""affair"" (it's called statutory rape) with a teacher, twice her age, who is cheating on his wife too. All of the cheating adult males are given complete passes - they are NICE dudes, come on! (sarcasm) I'm not surprised that a woman in production wrote an essay on xoxo Jane discussing the harassment and bullying from the director and others she was subjected to on this misogynist film. You have to wonder how Reese, now a prolific producer of film vehicles for strong female characters, looks back on the message this film sends.

1055925,5,6305574944,"One of the rare films, which is better than the book.

In this case, a gazillion times, because the book that inspired this film can barely be called a book.  Election by Tom Perrotta  (a book I shamefully own and have never picked up again - not even to read while sitting on the crapper) is generic, stillborn, and clearly, written within an hour.  I admit the concept is novel, which probably seduced producers , and to defeat a copyright lawsuit is why the book was optioned.

Reese Witherspoon is a revelation as Tracy Flick.  Her emotions span the gambit of a teenager, though she is ambitious than any teen, but her sexual naivet betrays her.  She is the daughter of an ambitious paralegal, a single mother, who spends her spare time writing to successful women.  From nurture or nature - or a little bit of both, Tracy Flick is ruthless, ultra-sensitive, malevolent, and can be unlikable.

Matthew Broderick plays popular history teacher Jim McAllister, who has never liked Tracy Flick, blaming her for his colleague's termination.

There is a school election, and Jim McAllister encourages dim-witted student Paul Metzler/Chris Klein to run against Tracy Flick, and then in an extraordinary gesture, destroys some ballot slips.  But of course, Tracy Flick is not so pure - tearing her opponent's posters, but unwilling to confess her wrong.

Reese Witherspoon is just perfect in the role.  Young, belligerent, head-strong, not really pretty.  She is intense, sadistic, and without remorse.  Love her curls and weird overalls.  She was really great, and even veteran actors were in her thrall.  This is one of her best performances.

This is excellent storytelling. Brilliant, funny, clever, and entertaining.  So good all the way.  Leagues upon leagues better than the book.",1439769600,,1783,5.020477815699659

1055934,2,6305574944,"In the movie Election, it began by highlighting certain students and teachers lives in this one particular high school. The first student played by Reese Witherspoon known as the character Tracy Flick was a person with high set standards for ones self and had a hard time connecting fully with other students. However, her character Tracy Flick winds up becoming too close with one of her teachers, who eventually get fired for his actions. Their history teacher Mr. McAllister talks the second student, Paul Metzler, into joining the schools election for student body president all because he does not like the idea of Tracy winning the elections and having to work with her alone (his friend was the one who got into trouble with Tracy). The next student to join the election is Pauls sister Tracy who claims not to be attracted to the other sex, but actually is, and joins in spite of her ex-crush Lisa who begins dating her brother after breaking Tracys heart. Eventually the schools election occurs and Tracy winds up winning over Paul by one vote, but Mr. McAllister throws away two of Tracys votes just so Paul will win. However, Mr. McAllister is caught and has to leave Omaha, Nebraska high school.

The teachers actions through out this movie were inexcusable. A teacher should not become involved in a student election just because they do not want a certain student to win. I also disagree fully with what the teacher in the beginning (Mr. McAllisters friend) did with the character Tracy Flick. The only good action that took place during the start of the movie was the teachers honesty with the principle about his actions.

I would not recommend this movie. Honestly it is a little uncomfortable to watch as a normal comedy for some people depending on their preferences. It pushes the limits too far with some realities turning into comedic actions. Teachers in general will learn what not to do as a teacher from this movie, if they dare to continue watching it after the first ten minutes. It is not for everyones eyes or tastes.",1427846400,,2047,4.779661016949152

1056094,3,6305574944,"This 1999 release, based on a book of the same name by Tom Perrotta, came along, quite interestingly, in the year after Lewinskygate, and the year before the contentious 2000 U.S. Presidential Election.
  Shifting the action  of the original novel from New Jersey to Nebraska, director Alexander Payne presents the story of George Washington Carver High School Civics teacher Jim McAllister's( Matthew Broderick in a role which gives him his comeuppance for being Ferris Bueller) dealing with a ruthless high achiever named Tracy Flick( a hyper-alert looking Reese Witherspoon).
  The narration of the story goes from person to person among the story's main characters. We learn that Tracy is the daughter of a very devoted single mom (Colleen Camp), who formerly worked as a flight attendant for Northwestern Airlines and who currently works as a paralegal secretary for Omaha, Nebraska's biggest law firm. Judith R. Flick spends much time writing letters to prominently successful women such as Elizabeth Dole and Connie Chung, asking them how they achieved their status and for advice for her daughter. They usually recommend hard work and determination, pointing out that as females, they may face more obstacles.
  Tracy is involved in many school activities. We briefly see her involvement in the school's production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as the character, Hodel, as a reporter for the school news network, as a yearbook editor, with the Spanish Club, the Future Business Leaders of America, and most significantly as a member of the Student Government Association: Tracy is running for School President, completely unopposed.
  As those who enter public life may risk having certain peccadilloes exposed, both Mr. McAllister and Tracy give us their take on Tracy's indiscretion with another teacher named Dave Novotny(Mark Harelik), who was Jim's best friend, the previous year. The affair resulted in Dave's wife, Linda(Delaney Driscoll) divorcing him and his having to live with his parents in Wisconsin, but luckily, not facing incarceration for having sex with a minor.
  Tracy 's focus in describing the incident is that while some may feel she was looking for a father figure, she felt safe with Mr. Novotny and that he was the only person who knew ""the real me"", in her words, but Tracy's mother was not happy about finding Dave's invitation to a tropical getaway among her daughter's things.
 This will not be the only major crisis over which the Principal, Dr. Walter Hendricks(Phil Reeves) will have to deal with in the course of this film .
  To give students an alternative to voting only for Tracy, Jim recruits an initially reluctant football player, Paul Metzler(Chris Klein), the school's star Quarterback, benched because of a skiing injury, to run against Tracy. Paul is a nice likeable fellow, who thinks Tracy is better suited for the Presidency. Comparatively inarticulate, and non-intellectual. Paul's popularity works in his favor as a candidate. Part of the reason for his popularity is that his father(Holmes Osborne) is wealthy and owns a local cement plant. The likelihood of being defeated by someone who hasn't worked as hard for the Presidency as she has earns Tracy's ire, and definitely fires her determination to be the class President.
 The dynamics of Paul's home life add more fuel to the fire. In response to being jilted by her best friend, Lisa Flanagan(Frankie Ingrassia) in favor of her brother, Paul's adopted, rebellious lesbian sister, Tammy(Jessica Campbell), launches her own Presidential bid. But her brother remains unaware of Tammy's reasons for running against him, and her behavior  becomes more and more out-of-control, gradually disqualifying her. There are certain scenes between Paul and Lisa I could have done without seeing, however.
 The campaign heats up, and on one weekend evening after working on the yearbook in the looking glass office, one of Tracy's campaign posters begins to unfurl. After accidently tearing the poster in the process of trying to rectify the problem, the high-strung girl has a fit that results in her destroying all the posters, and discarding them. During an inquiry, Tracy covers her tracks in a way that embarrasses Jim and makes him feel a bit threatened. Soon, Tracy is off the hook, although Mr. McAllister knows the truth. Throughout this film we also see him Jim has had to guard against his own feelings for Tracy.
 Meanwhile Jim and his wife Diane( Molly Hagan) are perhaps overly concerned with Linda Novotny's welfare after her divorce. Prior to the Novotny's divorce, they were accustomed to spending time with them at their home and were the godparents of their infant son. But, in a pattern I have personally observed among a few divorced people as well as their children, Linda is becoming more and more needy and intrusive towards the couple, asking Jim to make home repairs, wanting to go on mall excursions with him, and gradually seducing him in a way that is immediately more apparent to the audience than to him. An astute person might recommend she join a church or a singles group for support rather than take advantage of one couple.
 Just before the election, the tryst takes place, and while Jim initially feels on top of the world to the point of imagining himself driving an Italian sports car to work, and leading a better quality of life, his euphoria will soon end, bring him crashing back down to a bitter reality that will alter the course of his life. His attempt to rig the correct ballot count in a moment of aggravation after the voting has ended, discovered by the school janitor(Loren Nelson), will cost him even more.
  Gradually we learn the fates of each of the main characters and see that while Jim still desires Tracy's personal accountability regarding her tearing up the posters, we see his own failure to acknowledge his own role in ruining his own life. We trust that in due time,  Tracy's shortcomings will come back to haunt her, and see Jim concede that there will always be ambitious students like her.
 While much of the film's material is not appropriate for children, I have give some kudos to a film that holds my interest in the way this one has.",1380758400,,6201,5.00485908649174

1056214,5,6305574944,"I loved this movie in the theater when it came out, and just watched it again recently.  Of the recent negative reviews, one makes a good point:  Yes, there is plenty of sex in this movie.  It's a movie dealing with adultery, desire, temptation, and sex, and even has a (not graphically shown) gay romance, and if that upsets you, avoid this film.  But the sex is in service - so to speak - to a larger point, which is the way we lie to others and especially to ourselves.  That's at the heart of this brilliant and hilarious film.  If you don't see that, you're not getting the big joke of the film.

This movie lets us hear the thoughts of many of the characters, with a first-person narration that jumps from person to person.  And with only one exception, every character in this movie is constantly lying to themselves in a way that should make any honest viewer both laugh and squirm. (The one character who doesn't, as far as I can tell, is a simple, honest, nice and not very bright guy who simply takes people for who they are and believes the lies people tell him.  And one of the jokes in the film is that while being lied to by others he's much happier and better off than all the smarter folk who are lying to themselves.)

It's the contrast between what they're telling themselves (and us) and what they're experiencing and doing that underlies almost every joke and scene.  The people who said they didn't see what was funny - they must have tuned out one or the other.",1342483200,3,1484,4.36

We reached the scene where another teacher - a *teacher* mind you - describes Witherspoon's character's (Tracy) ""best"" quality as having ""a wet pu**y"", in a dialogue with Crawford's character (Jim Lassiter).

A couple of brief scenes into the other teacher's flashback of his triumphant sexual seduction (I'd suggest predation would be a far better term) of the ""willing"" high school student, I glanced over at my wife, and said ""No"", and she nodded in firm agreement and we turned the movie off.

A seduction as having comedic value, even the willing seduction of a high school female, by an avaracious sexual predator, no matter how ""willing"" the high-schooler as characterized by the script, is ...disturbing.

...I have no idea if the movie has any other saving grace. The movie has received generally high reviews at the several web sites devoted to movies (IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes in particular), and here at Amazon.

Matthew's life also falls apart as he tries to help his friend's wife after she is left alone.  A very sweet and insightful comedy/drama which has a deep understanding of people and place.  The movie is the 2nd full length feature of Alexander Payne who also directed and wrote The Descendants and Sideways.  My personal feeling is that his mainstream films are still good but less interesting and fun as his earlier, funny films.  Election definitely stands the test of time as does Citizen Ruth, his first movie.  Another shout out to Tom Perrotta, the author who has written many wonderful books such as The Abstinence Teacher and The Leftovers.

When Amazon classifies Alexander Payne's 1999 satire, ""Election,"" as an ""essential video,"" note these guys (or gals) are on to something. Not only is this film essential in its importance to film and the genre of comedy, but it's simply a piece filmmaking at its best.

Reese Witherspoon is hands down fantastic as the irritatingly over-achiever, Tracy Flick, who will stop at nothing in earning her rightful place as class president. Matthew Broderick is brilliant as the content educator but malicious rival to Tracy who will stop at nothing to bring her down. It's a teriffic film about politics against a high school setting. What could easily have been another silly cliched teen comedy is something more with Alexander Payne's witty script and observant direction: a mature, sophisticated, satirical, black comedy that should have caused more of a stir back in 1999. The film was well received by critics and even earned some award nominations including an Oscar for the adaption of Tom Perrotta's novel (of the same name). It definitely among my favorites.

Blu-ray features (**): Sadly,. this film is slighly under par as to what the blu-ray format is capable of. It definitely surpasses the DVD release, but the film show some evident flaws. Scratches and splotches are abundant-not neccessarily grain. You know those annoying black spots that ""Fight Club"" dubbed as ""cigarette burns?"" Yeah. They're present too, maybe not as big but it's visible. Then we have the special features. Wait. There are no special feature besides an insightful commentary by Alexander Payne. That's it. For the dollar your spending, ""Election"" is absolutely worth it. I just wish Paramount would have taken better care of the transfer and possibly even add a few more goodies.

1056285,4,6305574944,"Election is a comedy about a High School election, but it is told primarily from the point-of-view of teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick). Scenes of teachers sabotaging their student's hopes and dreams out of bitter resentment for their own failures are a staple of the coming of age genre, but usually the teachers are just a minor speed bump on the major character's road to destiny. Here, the film stays with the teacher, who seems to be a decent fellow except for some major character flaws that make him do some pretty awful things.

---------------
Tracy Flick: It's like my mom says, ""The weak are always trying to sabotage the strong.""
===============

The source novel, ""Election,"" by Tom Perrotta parallels Budd Schulberg's 1941 novel ""What Makes Sammy Run?"" In Schulberg's novel, an older writer (Al Manheim) watches young Sammy Glick run through the gauntlet of New York journalism and the Old Hollywood studio system. In ""Election,"" Al Manheim = Jim McAllister + Sammy Glick = Tracy Flick.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is perhaps a bit irritating in her relentless ambition, but she hardly merits the full-on vendetta unleashed by McAllister. Our sympathy shifts away from McAllister as we see that he has become somewhat fixated on thwarting Flick's ambitions due to his own frustrations. At first he merely avoids calling on her in class, though she is always first to raise her hand in response to any question. He could merely be trying to get more involvement and participation from some of the other students. When she runs for President unopposed his dislike of Tracy escalates to the next level, and he steps in to encourage a well-liked student, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run for President.

---------------
Tracy Flick: You might think it upset me that Paul Metzler had decided to run against me but nothing could be further from the truth. He was no competition for me; it was like apples and oranges. I had to work a little harder, that's all. See, I believe in the voters; they understand that elections aren't just popularity contests; they know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and don't have everything handed to them on a silver spoon. Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers owns Metzlers cement and give them trucks on their 16th birthday and throw them big parties all the time. No, they don't ever have to work for anything. They think they can just all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked very, very hard for their entire lives. No, it didn't bother me at all.
===============

A further complication is that Tracy Flick has had an affair with McAllister's friend and colleague, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik). Dave was fired and his wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) kicked him out. McAllister's wife and Linda were friends, so he ends up spending a lot of time helping Linda out, and begins to feel temptation. He starts an ill fated affair with Linda, sowing the seeds of his own destruction.

As if that weren't enough crazy plot twists, Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is in love to the point of obsession, but when her girlfriend breaks up with her and starts going out with Paul and becomes his campaign manager to spite her, she decides to run for President to spite them both. She is like the anarchist candidate, but as you might imagine, anarchy is very appealing to High School students. Her platform to dismantle the whole Student Body Government would probably carry the election, were she not more interested in just getting expelled and sent to an all-girl catholic school.

Election is not a laugh-out-loud hilarious comedy, but it is more of a dark comedy, with a skewed world view. The director, Alexander Payne, was gearing up for greater success with Sideways, with its cast of even more flawed characters, obnoxious and unlikable, who grow on you, much like a fungus. Other notable films of Payne's are About Schmidt and Citizen Ruth.

Also gearing up for greater success is Reese Witherspoon, who proved herself adept at comedy in the popular Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Alabama, then conquered drama with a well deserved Oscar for Walk the Line. She totally stole the show from Joaquin Phoenix, the ostensible star of the Johnny Cash biopic as June Carter Cash, Johnny's long suffering wife. In Election she stretches herself in several directions, running the gamut from A to Z, going from strident martinet to obnoxiously perky in a heartbeat.

---------------
Tracy Flick: [narrating] None of this would have happened if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did. He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny. You see, you can't interfere with destiny. That's why it's destiny. And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.

1056286,2,6305574944,"To quote my mother, ""Wow.  Where the Hell did THAT go?""

What a juvenile movie.  This one seriously needed a hormone-ectomy.  Illogical sexual entanglements and product-placement swearing don't substitute for genuine cleverness.  One got the feeling that the directors felt the need to have a character spit out the F-word right into the camera every ten minutes, or whenever the plot started to stumble, to make sure the audience was still paying attention.  I mean, I get that it was supposed to be dark humor.  They got the ""dark"" right but the ""humor"" was pretty puerile and lame.  It had all sorts of plot lines that didn't go anywhere and, consequently, did not make sense.  It didn't actually have any insight into any of the characters.  It was SHALLOW.  Good satire is not shallow.

It's pretty misogynistic, too.  Actually, Tammy's character, though pitiable, is probably the most human female in it (she's a confused teenaged lesbian, which didn't bother me but will probably bother people who are bothered by lesbianism and rebelliousness).  The rest are vicious manipulators (Tracy and Lisa) or cold bitches (Linda and Diane).  Broderick's character is a self-serving, embarrassing, loser, but I guess we're supposed to sympathize[?].

Has anyone EVER encountered a dumb jock as nice as Paul?  All the dumb jocks at my school were self-centered jerks who got away with all sorts of garbage because they were *jocks*, and Heaven forbid anyone discipline the football team.

It did remind me, though, of how much I hated high school in general and student-body elections in particular.  What a total crock.",1216944000,,1617,5.056818181818182
1056287,4,6305574944,"There are over 200 reviews for this disc...

Let's just say it's not a slapstick comedy, but it doesn't try to be.  It is witty, clever, and full of self-depricating humor.  Broderick is in his element.",1210982400,,202,4.555555555555555
1056288,5,6305574944,"You've probably seen the snippet on YouTube that proclaims ""Hillary Clinton IS Tracy Flick!""  Well, my friends, it's true.  If you enjoyed that little scene, you must revisit Alexander Payne's darkly comic 1999 gem and see for yourself how oddly prescient it was in depicting the precise dynamic going on now in American presidential politics.  Reese Witherspoon is Tracy, a rabidly ambitious high school student in Omaha, Nebraska (Director Payne's hometown, which he also lovingly lampooned in ""About Schmidt""), who is determined, by sheer grit, to win the election for student body president.  Tracy is the ideal of college selection boards everywhere: bright, perky, neat, organized, always prepared for class, and single-mindedly involved in more school activities than there are hours in the day.  On paper, she's a educator's dream . . . but she represents an uneasy nightmare for her social studies teacher, Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick).  Mr. McAllister has his own reasons for disliking Tracy.  She is the kind of grating apple polisher that has her hand up with the answer to every question he poses.  She's at school every morning an hour before everyone else, and works late evenings and weekends on all her various extracurricular responsibilies.  And she had an affair with Mr. McAllister's best friend and colleague that resulted in him losing both his job and his marriage.  Tracy herself seems blithely oblivious to all the havoc she has caused.  Is this wide-eyed naivete genuine or is at all an elaborate act?  Mr. McAllister is inclined to believe the latter. The spectre of having to spend lots and lots of quality time alone with Tracy in his capacity as student government advisor looms large, and he persuades popular-but-dim quarterback Paul(Chris Klein) to run against Tracy.  Despite having her picture splashed on every page of the yearbook (which she also edits), Tracy is a lonely figure.  Her ruthless ambition and complete lack of humor about herself make friendships impossible.  Tracy's robotic efficiency makes her best-suited to the government wonk job, but the engaging and likeable Paul threatens to steal the election right from under Tracy's pert and entitlist nose, making the campaign increasingly contentious.

In one of her earliest starring roles, Reese Witherspoon displays the acting chops that would later garner her an Oscar.  Ms. Witherspoon plays against her naturally sunny and likeable persona to create Tracy and she is so successful, it is frightening.  She gives Tracy flashes of vulnerability when we almost want to hug her for trying so hard . . .and then hardens that into a steely Machiavellian drive that repulses.  It is one of the most subtle yet devastating performances ever by an actress, and given Ms. Witherspoon's youth at the time, all the more amazing.  Broderick has an equally challenging role as Tracy's foil, a man so bent on engineering her downfall, he fails to recognize his own less admirable qualities until it's too late.  Fans of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" have perhaps matured sufficiently to recognize the deep irony in having Ferris himself become a schlubby member of the Establishment.  Broderick has in some ways the trickier role, yet he succeeds in navigating the fine line between pathos and humor and makes McAllister a low-rent Everyman that we can root for.

The last time McAllister, and the audience see Tracy, several years after the events of the movie, she is a congressional aide getting into a limo with her congressman, with the White House in the background behind her.  Hmm.  The obvious similarity to Monica Lewinsky aside, Tracy reminds us of someone else we have gotten to know very well these last 10 or so years, who has her sights firmly fixed on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . . .again.  Were Payne and novelist Tom Perotta on whose book the screenplay is based eerily psychic, or are the glaring similarities to HRC's rise just a cosmic chuckle?  We may have months yet before the outcome of 'our' election is decided . . . while you are killing time before November, watch this and have a a rueful laugh.  Was Tracy Flick inspired by Hillary Clinton, or are Tracy and HRC just two examples of a feminine archtype that's as old as the human race itself?  We may never know!",1208476800,7,4287,5.007052186177715
1056289,4,6305574944,"This comedy has a great cast headed by Reese Witherspoon. Reese truly embodies this character that I'm sure we all remember from high school. The over achieving, over obsessed teen that would be involved in every school function and would stop at nothing to get what they wanted. This film will remind you of those 80's school comedies but, it's a much smarter satirical film then those type comedies. Well above average for these types of movies.",1203292800,2,447,4.818181818181818
1056310,1,6305574944,"Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell) asks the question at a Pep Rally in this film.  Her one promise, if she gets elected as class president, she'll disband the Student Government and the student body won't have to sit through another [...] Pep Rally.

Her audience went wild.

We've all been there--in varying places in the student body at events like these.  Some, like Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) are desperately trying to grab as much control as we can.  Others like Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) are trying to turn a bad situation into good and maybe do some good for others while they're at it.

Tammy--well, Tammy just wants revenge on her ex-girlfriend Lisa who took up with her brother Paul to prove she's not a lesbian.

Those are your choices if you're one of the students of Carver High in ""Election.""  And the plot just gets more convoluted from there.

You see, nobody but Tracy really wanted the presidency until Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), the Student Government Advisor and Social Sciences teacher, stepped in and suggested that Paul, who had a sports injury and couldn't play for the year, run to 'give a little back' to the school.

Why did McAllister do this?  Last year, Tracy'd had a fling with a fellow teacher and one of his friends---McAllister didn't want to be in the position to have to ""spend more time with Tracy,"" when she won the election--and that was closer to that particular 'student body' than he wanted to be.

Like so many elections--there's just nobody to really root for.  That in itself, was depressing.

Matthew Broderick's performance was said by many critics to have improved from limpid with this film, but I just don't see it.  He never particularly demonstrated anything but an immobile sort of pathos.

1056312,5,6305574944,"Alexander Payne in ""Election"" has created a winning, contemporary version of satirical ""old comedy,"" looking for instance at that usual staple of comic writing, romantic love, with an unfashionably jaundiced eye, preferring instead to group almost all his characters, whatever the nature of their ""relationships,"" as essentially knaves or fools. The American race to the top and the people used and discarded along the way are his subjects, starting with the admittedly minor election of a class president at an Omaha, Nebraska high school but ending up on the fringes of real political power in Washington, D.C.

Tracy Enid Flick (Reese Witherspoon), one of the film's two central characters, is monotonously bent on succeeding not only in the high school election but, sadly, in just about everything else.
A creation of a stage mother of sorts, Tracy is an eerily familiar American type, the cute little girl who, no matter where on the playground she might be, at the ringing of the bell is nonetheless always first in the cookie line. She has been described by one blue state critic as a combination of Pat and Richard Nixon, but it's unduly narrow not to see that her character transcends party lines, that she is both the Nixons AND the Clintons rolled into one. For her, anything is fair game if it enables success, and this in whatever contest she's entered, no matter how trivial.

Her principal opponent is the initially high-minded high school history teacher Mr. M (Matthew Broderick), ponderer of questions on ethics and morals. His character, however, is complicated, like Tracy's, both by foolish lust and finally envy. Ironically, he comes to represent the knavish underside of Tracy's own mad race to the top.

The characters who receive the least harsh satirical treatment in the film are the Metzler kids, both of whom stand in marked contrast to Tracy. Paul, the varsity jock who actually has to be persuaded to run against Tracy, is essentially just a dumb bunny with a good heart, while his devious sister, the anarchic, uber-outsider Tammy, is more interested in simply finding a female soulmate than in winning meaningless elections. Despite the bravura performances of Witherspoon and Broderick, Chris Klein (Paul) and especially Jessica Campbell (Tammy) come very close to stealing the picture from them.

All told, ""Election"" is an early satiric triumph from one of America's most insightful contemporary writer/directors.",1195948800,3,2450,5.148241206030151

What's the difference anyway.... The difference is this movie depicts the great clash that exists between talking about good ethics and actually practicing them.

I love to talk about the motives of the characters in this movie... The symbols shouldn't be overlooked either. For example, in the title section, there is a sprinkler on that never moves... symbolic of Mr. M's rutted life...

Matthew Broderick has always been an 80's joy, and after twenty years he still makes me laugh.  You look at him and sometimes go, ""WOW look at what's happened to Ferris Bueller!"".  There's no doubt in my mind that one day I'll probably think back to the 90's, remembering all of my favorite actors, and remember Broderick, in roles just like this one.
Receiving an Oscar just last year for the role of June Carter in ""Walk the Line"", Reese Witherspoon is a star.  It's so easy to sit back and watch her in a movie like this.  She's so believable, and so dedicated... all you want to do is watch her.  And for me, before the whole Johnny Cash comeback in movies today, my favorite Reese Witherspoon movie and character ever, was of Tracy Flick in ""Election"".  I hope I see Reese when she's acting at the age of 60.
From teachers to students, we're all haunted or either proud for what we all went through.  It was long, maybe boring, maybe helpful, or honestly... hell.

The thing is, this movie isn't funny or even mildly entertaining.  I see absolutely no point to have Tracy Flick involved in a sexual relationship with one of her teachers, especially one who was so beneath her intellect and not in the least bit attractive.  Flick makes a comment that maybe she was looking for a father-figure-but then her search seemed to just stop and there's no real point to it.  If you look at it as further coal to the fire for McAlister to hate her (since it was his best friend) it doesn't really work, since he, too, struggled with the moral and ethical war within himself.  What was the point of the lesibans angle or Tammy taking the fall for Tracy?  Nothing in this movie seem like it was building toward anything.  It was a bunch of isolated incidents thrown together.  Even the ending felt like it didn't know when to end.  No one ever seems to have a problem when a man is ambitious or drunk with power, but when you put those characteristics in a woman: watch out.

In his desire to thwart, he manages to destroy his career and marriage, while Tracy Flick thrives.

1056318,5,6305574944,"Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick star in this variation on ethics and morality tale played out through a high school election. This film reminded me very much of 2003's ""Saved"", where a ver similar tale was played out at a Christian school.

Here Witherspoon is remarkably well-cast as Tracy Flick, a high school go-getter than wants to be school president. However, teacher Mr. McAllister (Broderick) knows Tracy is bad news and tries his best to prevent her from winning. He enlists a football star to run against Tracy; later, the star's lesbian sister gets in on the election on an apathy ballot.

Everyone manages to violate some form of ethical behavior in this film, which is very well-acted with a brisk pace, good sets and wonderful sense or realism in a fictitious Omaha, Neb. high school. Almost every character in the story starts out wanting to do well but ends up violating some moral or ethical behavior.

Is there a point to this film? Obviously, that people will go to extremes to get what they want. I think that is secondary to the ""fun"" element, however. The morality tale is what makes the film memorable (aside from the brilliant acting by all the students and the direction) but it is the laughter and humor the individual stories generate that keep you glued to the story.

In the end, this is a great movie for any adult that attended school, demonstrates a human frailty, or knows anything about power and the abuse of power. It is one of many notches in the bedpost for Witherspoon, who is now Hollywood's most highest-paid actress. You'll begin to see why watching her characterization here.",1164672000,7,1626,4.796428571428572
1056319,5,6305574944,"Last night I finally had the chance to watch `Election' and I have to say that it was everything I hoped it would be.  It was smart, funny and enjoyable, a pretty good way to spend an evening.  This was truly a shining moment for its young star Reese Witherspoon, and arguably the role of Tracy Flick should have landed her her first Oscar nomination.  As Tracy, Witherspoon effortlessly switches from sweet goody-two-shoes over achiever to evil revenge driven competitor.

The film follows a school election where Tracy is the sole runner for school council president.  After having an affair with a teacher, Dave (Mark Harelik), who proved to be the best friend of teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick in a performance I didn't see in him) she has formed an enemy in Jim, and so when Jim realizes that her constant winning streak of getting whatever she wants no matter who she bulldozers over needs to end he bribes popular jock Paul Metzler (Chris Kline) to run against her.

This small gesture sparks a feud that gets all but too heated and leads to some pretty crazy, and funny situations.  Not only does Paul run but so does his younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a lesbian who is so upset that her ex-girlfriend has taken up with Paul that she decides to run against him and when she begins to get more support than Paul and Tracy combined Tracy begins to think of ways to get Tammy removed from the race.  The election is far from the only thing on Jim's mind as he becomes too close to Dave's ex-wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) and begins an affair that may cost him his marriage.

The script is tight and fresh and the acting is genuinely hysterical (all except Chris Kline who is just a horrid actor).  Matthew Broderick, an actor I am normally none to fond of, actually delivers here, but it's Reese who steels the show with every tantrum, every concerned and or distressed facial expression and that whole poster tearing scene...priceless!  If you want a fresh high school comedy that's smart enough for the adult mind then pick `Election'.",1164672000,3,2063,4.686980609418282
1056340,5,6305574944,"The bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school, overachievers, bored teachers, society, competitive people, politics, and marriages mired in ennui are all about. It's smart, it's incredibly funny, and it gets the most out of a very good cast.

Election, set in the 1990's at a school outside Omaha, tells the story of a frightening human dynamo, a senior who wishes to cap off her near-perfect career in high school by being elected to the student counsel presidency. As played by Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick (whose last name spelled several times in the movie all in capital letters---""FLICK""---looks suggestively like another word) sees the office as the next logical step in her sociopathic upward climb toward a full scholarship to Georgetown. Tracy has a single-mindedness that borders on mental illness, and a ruthlessness powered by a vicious drive that at times seems genuinely scary to behold. This uber-overachiever has been top of the honor roll for years, and has headed a number of extracurricular clubs, from being editor of the school yearbook to...you name it. She has also destroyed the life and reputation of a teacher who grew carelessly fond of her, and before Election is done she does-in another, here played by Matthew Broderick. Broderick's social sciences teacher, Mr. McAllister, senses the destructive force Tracy let loose on post-high school society might become, and he makes it his mission to sabotage her bid to become class president. First McAllister convinces the school's dopey star athlete, played Chris Klein, to oppose Tracy in the election, and later McAllister crosses the line and uses his position as head of the election committee to make certain Tracy loses. The meltdowns that occur to several key characters in Election are at times played off as funny but more than once the makers of this movie were courageous enough to let them be disturbing, particularly the scene where Tracy, believing the outcome of the election has not been in her favor, breaks down emotionally, revealing the insecure, needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior.

Election is comedy at its smartest. The writing is polished, the delivery of these stunningly perfect lines is flawless, and the humor mixes cerebral parody with at times a fun version of crudity. It's one of the best dark comedies of all time.",1160956800,3,2373,5.11340206185567
1056341,5,6305574944,"Terrific movie. Matthew Broderick makes you believe that he is a high school social studies teacher with every step he takes and every rhythm of his speech (""Good luck, there, Tracy""). Reese Witherspoon can't be accused of underacting her part, but that's the fun of it. She is hilarious as the high school overachiever who doesn't care who she steps over (or on) to succeed.

Filmed on the site of a real Omaha high school, many of the other members of the cast are taken from local talent. All the extras are actual students, and one of the leads (Chris Klein of ""American Pie"" who plays Tracy's archrival Paul) was just the kid who had nailed the part of Tony in the school's recent production of ""West Side Story."" This was his break-out movie. Even the custodian was played by the real custodian. All that gives the film a kind of realism that's rare.

It accordingly uses ordinary sounds and spaces brilliantly, from the rotating sprinkler that begins the film, to the noises of kids talking outside class, to the grind of the garbage truck in the early morning hours when Mr. M snoozes outside Linda Novotny's house waiting for her (never) to return home. And on the subject of garbage, watch for the number of times this becomes a motif in the film, leading up to the culminating event (which I won't spoil). Even the denouement has a rehabilitated Mr. M, turned museum docent, throwing trash at the rear window of a limo. This is not only a very funny movie; it's also an intelligent and careful one.

It's a very well thought out and set out movie, well designed with interesting characters and an intriguing plot. It's all those things. Reese Witherspoon's dilligent yet intesely ditzy Tracy is a colorful character too, and I can definitely see how she went on to do ""Legally Blonde"". However, there is an awful lot of crude humour and love affairs and whatnot, and it muddies things rather than makes them more interesting, I felt. I'm not exactly sure which character's side I'm supposed to be on, which is confusing. I'm not really drawn to any of the characters by the end of it, they're all so drowning in their own vices.

Alexander Payne uses many diverse stylistics (mutliple voice over, freeze frames, flashbacks) to build a story that is both intelligent and filled with many unique plot twists.  Reese Witherspoon is great in it, and got good reviews, but Matthew Broderick is just as good--the best performance of his career.  The story is filled with big laughs--from crude humor to some of the most intelligent dialogue I've probably ever heard.

If you like the movie, it's worth checking out the book by Tom Perrotta, which is very different in tone and style.  While the plot is nearly identical, Alexander Payne (director) treats his characters much harsher than Perrotta.

Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she ""can carry out his divine plan.""  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.

This black comedy/satire has so much going for it, I hardly know where to begin. This film, along with 2006's ""Thank You for Smoking"", proves that it is possible to produce an adult, intelligent, and thoroughly entertaining film without pandering to the lowest common denominator mentality that most producers aim for.

The entire cast and acting is top notch. Broderick and Witherspoon are the only big names.  The rest are character actors you may or may not have seen before.

The movie is REAL.  It was shot in a real high school in Omaha, using real high school students as extras.  Sometimes, you can see actual classes in session.  This gives the film a realistic feel.

Anyone who has attended high school has had a Tracy Flick and a Paul Metzler in their class. They are not simply stereotypes--their existence in real life makes the story real (the president of MY senior class was on the football, baseball, and basketball teams, and later became manager of the New York Mets when his professional baseball career was cut short because of a knee injury).

I found Jessica Campbell to be the surprise delight in the movie. She is as disaffected as Paul and Tracy are normal.  When they are giving their speeches, Tracy delivers a by-the-book speech, and Paul delivers a barely coherent speech (leaving the galleries staring silently). THEN, Tammy starts HER speech with ""Who cares about this stupid election?"" She promises to do only one thing as Student Council President--immediately dismantle the student government so nobody will have to sit through one of ""these stupid assemblies again!""  She speaks the truth, and the former darkhourse candidate is rewarded by thunderous applause and hoots of ""Tammy! Tammy!""  She is punished for her impudence with a three-day suspension (""Being suspended is like having a paid vacation."")

The prim and proper Tracey raises feelings of sympathy and revulsion in equal measure while McAllister is a character that deserves everything that comes to him...and come it does.

1056376,5,6305574944,"If nothing else, this will probably be the best thing that MTV Films ever slaps its label on.

""Sideways"" might actually be above this one, but I've always had an earnest appreciation for ""Election"".  Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne take Tom Perotta's engaging novel and craft a respectable, ruthless, and rather cunning satire from all of it.  I am not a fan of either Chris Klein nor Reese Witherspoon, however, leave it up to Payne to coax the best I'll see from them.  They are very well-suited to their respective roles.

As a high school film, this movie excels.  ""Election"" closely traces a student-body election at an Omaha, Nebraska High School with a camera akin to Martin Scorsese's.  Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) is an unpopular, overachieving do-gooder.  The kind of girl who rules extracurricular activities, but couldn't make a friend to save her life.  She's running for senior-year student body president uncontested, so her Government teacher Jim McAllister (a sneakily good Matthew Broderick) propositions golden-boy favorite Paul Metzler to run against her, since a holiday injury prevents his being quarterback for the year.

McAllister does this out of an odd combination of rivalry and lust for Tracy, considering a liason she shared with a good friend and former colleague of Jim's, that resulted in his dismissal.  Basically, since Tracy represents those whose good fortune comes the easy and manipulative way, McAllister sets out to sabotage her campaign - in a misguided attempt to teach unruly ones a lesson by stooping to their very level.  Enter Tammy Metzler, a lesbian-leaning sophomore with a rebellious streak and Paul's little sister... and we got ourselves a big heaping allegory of backdoor shenanigans, espionage, sabotage, sexual scandal, betrayal, and of course... cupcakes adorned with the words ""PICK FLICK"" on 'em.  Sounds like a typical election - domestic or national - to me.  Wonderfully presented.

The gifts of Payne and Taylor are that they refuse to compromise the inherent realism encased inside a not-so-exaggerated scenario.  Special mention goes to Broderick and his supernal portrayal of a downtrodden teacher with a chip on his shoulder he refuses to acknowledge.  It's one of those performances that - back in '99 - I didn't realize how good it was until a half-hour after it was over.  If Ferris Bueller is Jekyll, then Jim McAllister is certainly Hyde.

Wait, before I forget, I must raise my glass to one Phil Reeves for his comical yet completely reverent role of Principal Walt Hendricks.  I had an Executive Vice Principal at my high school that was this man incarnate.  I sh-t you not.  His mannerisms, methods of speech and pause, dialogue... you know, that I-can-appear-cool-to-kids-if-I'm-as-condescending-as-they-are logic that those feeble turds exercise.  Man, the first time I saw this, I almost lost it in a fit of exasperated glee.  So real, it's scary.

I'm not gonna bother comparing/contrasting differences, embellishments from the book - because I haven't read it.  I'm sure it's wonderful, but ""Election"" can stand on its own and divert criticism if taken with a grain of salt.  What happens in the movie is not what you would expect from an MTV Presentation, much snappier and livelier and light-years ahead of ""Dead Man On Campus,"" ""Better Luck Tomorrow,"" or ""Varsity Blues.""  There's a sinister intelligence in here that culminates with a simple - albeit pivotal - revelation involving the school janitor.  It's awesome.

One of the more hilarious running gags involves tribal wailing and drum-thumping every time Tracy encounters a threat to her goals or happiness.  An auditory manifestation of the unfair turmoil she has to contend with.  That her character is a 17 year-old priss really sells the gag even more.  Kevin Tent's razor-sharp freeze-frames are nowhere except on the nose.  The cardinal sin of screenwriting - the voice-over - is on prominent display, but shifts from character to character, never anchoring itself to a specific center.  This does end up working in its humorous favor, as opposed to inciting confusion.

With a visual style that gets denser as things grow unstable, ""Election"" wholeheartedly earns its R-rating and is a sterling inclusion into that unbelievably stellar graduating class of 1999.  I could see this being a great double-feature along with ""Rushmore,"" released within weeks of each other and drawing much favorable comparison.

And the cost proves very high, indeed, after mild-mannered civics teacher Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) enlists dim-bulb football hero Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against Flick.  Adding to the chaos is a the last-minute candidacy of Metzler's lesbian sister, whose tell-it-like-it-is counter-cultural campaign draws the ire of school administrators even as it draws cheers from her fellow students.

Broderick is wonderful as Mr. McAllister, the well-meaning but naive and flawed (as it turns out) civics teacher whose subtle meddlings lead to disastrous consequences, personally and professionally.  And Witherspoon captures perfectly the driven (by a manipulative mother as well as her own inner demons) mover-and-shaker who knows only that she must get to the top, but never seems to ask why or at what cost, or what it all means.

Wild and crazy as the movie is, it never seems unbelievable, going just a little bit beyond yesterday's headlines of real life high school hanky panky.  Warning:  some crude language and simulated sex might prove embarrassing if you watch this with your pre-adult children, of any age.

1056379,5,6305574944,"Alexander Payne has continuously amazed me with his consistency in deconstructing the desires, urges and troubles all his characters face. So far, he has done movies for the pro-choice mothers (Citizen Ruth), retirees (About Schmidt), middle-aged losers (Sideways), and now he's targeting the teacher-student relationship as rifle range practice.

Matthew Broderick has finally grown out of his high school/brat pack role. Ferris Bueller had stopped fighting the Man and became one himself. He's the moral centre of the movie. The mouthpiece that attempts to deconstruct what went wrong in his own benign and somewhat sad, way. In this manner, we empathize with his character but then he did a big snafu on his own part (namely banging his best friend's wife).

Reese Withespoon is at her best here. With a cheery facade full of determination, but yet deep down boils a sort of resentment for authority figures, or at least people who gets into her way. As Ebert puts it, the character is the embodiment of an adolescent Elizabeth Dole or Hilary Rodham, filled with ambition and determination to succeed everywhere, just to prove a sense of self-worth in a world of uber-males.

Payne used the school election as a plot device or conduit to emphasize that taken into the real world context, one can imagine how much pain and sufferings every ""Democratic"" elections can cause.

1056400,3,6305574944,"Unless you're a kid or have been living under a rock for the past 20 years you have probably heard of and most likely seen Ferris Bueler's Day Off starring Matthew Broderick. In Ferris Bueler, Broderick played a care-free and slick high school senior who played by his own rules yet gave people the impression that he was a saint. Who would have guessed that 15 years latter Broderick would be playing a responsible and somewhat caring high school teacher? So what is the irony you ask? In Ferris Bueler, Principal Rooney was out to get Ferris because he knew that Ferris wasn't the ""goody two shoes"" that everyone (almost everyone) thought he was. In the movie Election, Broderick plays teacher Jim McAllister who has it out for a student (Reese Witherspoon) who is a ""top of her class"" perfectionist that gets things to go her way even if it means stepping on others by using dishonest methods to reach her desired goals. I am NOT suggesting that one compare Ferris Bueler to Election for they are seperate movies in themselves however I will say that fans of Ferris Bueler who haven't seen Election should know that Election is not the same family-friendly film that Ferris Bueler's Day Off was. Election is R-rated and is perverted at times. As interesting as the movie is, the viewer is most likely to notice a change of characater for Jim McAllister thoughout the movie. It's easy to feel sorry for some of the things that happens to him yet he also deserves what he gets to a degree. There are realistic circumstances that are touhced upon throughout the movie. Whether you are currently in high school or have long since graduated, you will probably be able to identify some of the characters in Election with students and teachers who you knew (or know) in high school. As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality are ok but there are no special features to speak of.

1056403,4,6305574944,"At the time I first watched this movie I had little idea who Reese Witherspoon was.  I have since seen numerous movies with Reese and have realized what a wonderful actress she can be.  I have seen numerous movies with Matthew Broderick, on the other hand, and have been disappointed with numerous performances after an early career where he catapulted into the limelight with incredible performances in movies such as ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Ladyhawke.""  However, Broderick redeems himself by a stellar performance as a high school teacher at George Washington Carver High School.

Tracy Enid Flick (Witherspoon) is an overachiever who lets nothing stand in the way of her goals.  In this case, nothing is Jim McAllister (Broderick).  McAllister lusts after Flick while simultaneously hating her.  McAllister encourages a popular student, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, who played Oz in ""American Pie""), to run against Flick for President of the student body.  Soon there is more back-stabbing, corruption and manipulation than in most movies about the subject.  I found many of the scenes almost painful to watch while being simultaneously funny because you knew that every attempted maneuvering against Flick was going to fail, regardless of how much you wanted it to succeed.

This movie is interesting because the plot is so relatively simple, which allows the movie to focus on character development.  We find out quickly that the entire movie is a one-sided chess game between McAllister and Flick.  Unfortunately, it is a chess game where McAllister never gets to see Flick's moves until after she makes them.  Much of the time you get the impression that Flick nearly ignores McAllister as though he is beneath her contempt.  When she does endeavor to control events involving McAllister, she does it so effortlessly that you wonder why McAllister even tries.  It gets to the point where the battle between McAllister and Flick (which Flick really never acknowledges in more than a cursory way as being to any extent a real challenge) brings to mind the line ""He brought a knife to a gun fight.""

A great deal of time is focused on McAllister's thoughts, and I squirmed often because I could see myself being a lot like McAllister in some ways, and wondered how I would act if put in his situation.  The fact that McAllister was so normal, and Flick had an innate ability to be either sweet and innocent and just as quickly turn cold and manipulating made the contrast between the two even more uncomfortable.  I was reminded of people I knew in high school and more recently a few people I have encountered in my work life.  Of course, now I know to just throw in the towel and give up, because people like that play the manipulation game far better than I.

This movie is for people who like to think, but the danger is that thinking about this movie can give you a headache.  I was able to watch it only once, because I kept empathizing with McAllister, and having Flick inflicted upon him was cruel and unusual punishment.  I hope I never encounter another person like her in real life.",1110067200,8,3103,4.837121212121212

Wonderful.",1104364800,4,411,5.492063492063492
1056405,4,6305574944,"I think everyone knew a Tracy Enid Flick in high school...she was the obsessive/compulsive prat that participated in every stinking activity, her face plastered all over the yearbook (whose production she was probably in charge of), eternally, often shamelessly, promoting herself for the next thing whatever it was, unceasingly sucking up to everyone and anyone in even the slightest position to assist her, all with the specific goal of cramming as much as possible on her transcripts, hoping to show whatever college board she applies to what a well rounded person she is...thing is, these people are so driven by what they perceive to be important they just don't comprehend how irritating they are to those around them, or if they do, they don't care, often believing such animosity is the result of jealously...but then that's just my opinion...I was one of those faceless, nameless bodies that drifted through high school, hoping to avoid attracting too much attention, wanting only to serve my time (much like prison inmates) and get out.  Election (1999), written and directed by Alexander Payne (About Schmidt, Sideways), stars Matthew Broderick (The Freshman, The Road to Wellville) and cute as a dimple Reese Witherspoon (Pleasantville, American Psycho).  Also appearing is Jessica Campbell (Freaks and Geeks) and Hinsdale, Illinois native Chris Klein in his first feature appearance (American Pie, Rollerball).

Broderick stars as James T. 'Jim' McAllister, a frumpy high school civics teacher and advisor to the student body government, seemingly content in his position, taking modest pride in assumption he's helping to mold young minds, preparing them for life after high school.  Life is going pretty well for Mr. McAllister, that is until he tries to go against the unstoppable force know as Tracy Enid Flick, an annoying, overachieving student running unopposed for student body president, by coercing dimwitted, but somewhat likeable, side-lined football star Paul Metzler (Klein) to run against her.  Mr. McAllister's veiled resentment of Tracy begins with an earlier event, one involving a tawdry liaison between Tracy and a fellow colleague, resulting in his colleague's dismissal and ultimately, divorce.  Now he sees Tracy as a real threat, one that only he has the power to do anything about, but his intercession leads to entanglements.  As the comical complications compound themselves (Paul's sister, played by Campbell, becomes involved in the election for reasons of her own), Mr. McAllister's life begins to spiral horribly out of control, resulting in the destruction of all he's worked for and holds dear, as destiny, as is Tracy, is something that can't be avoided.

For me, this story is basically about actions and consequences.  We witness various actions, like Mr. McAllister's meddling in the school election, result in destructive and life changing consequences, mostly at the hands of Tracy, the obsessively driven student who won't let anything get in her way.  Broderick is really wonderful, but it was odd seeing him play his character, as I best remember him from his role in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), and the two characters are nearly opposite.  The rest of the cast does very well, especially Phil Reeves, playing Principal Walter Hendricks, presenting the epitome of school administrators in both his mannerisms and dialogue.  Witherspoon is outstanding as Tracy, taking the role and infusing it with a real sense of absurdity, while maintaining a foot in reality, showing that her range as an actress is wider than most probably gave her credit for at the time.  She provides us with insight as to what exactly drives these uber-motivated individuals, and how far they'll go to get what they rightfully believe is owed to them.  I enjoyed the direction of this dark, sometimes disturbing comedy, but some may find it plodding and pointless.  Payne's use of cinematic effects, freeze frames and voice-overs were handled in such a way as to enhance the story, and blended in smoothly, rather than providing awkward distractions as they sometimes can in other films.  This is also evident in About Schmidt, especially the scenes where Jack Nicholson's character is composing letters to his sponsored African child, Ndugu.  Election is a bit more unrestrained than Payne's About Schmidt (2002), more akin to his latest film Sideways (2004) with regards to the level of vulgarity, but in all three movies, the characters presented don't seem to be put forth to be necessarily liked by the audience, but more so as analogous representations of individuals you may very well know, or deal with on a day to day basis.  Normally I enjoy films with characters whose positive aspects I can identify with, as I think a lot of people do, but here there's very little of that, as we see the glossy veneer peeled away revealing all kinds of sordid, morally reprehensible nastiness (the scenes where Broderick's character's various indiscretions are exposed were uncomfortable much like that of seeing a couple fight in public...you know you mind your own affairs, tend to your business, but I think there's an instinctual level where we as humans are inescapably drawn to conflict, maybe not desiring to be a part of it, but finding perverse enjoyment at the misfortunes of others.  If you are uncomfortable with frank and explicit themes, specifically about sex, and dislike the casual use of vulgarity, then you should probably avoid this intelligent, well written, mildly abrasive, dark comedy.

The wide screen anamorphic picture presented on this DVD looks clear and clean, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround, comes through very well.  Special features are scant, as there's only a so-so commentary track by director Alexander Payne available.  I thought it kind of odd not to include a theatrical trailer for the film, but then special features with regards to DVD releases has never been Paramount Studios strong point.

 I normally post before I read the other user reviews, but I this time I indulged in the other opinions. I didn't read them all, but I did notice one trend that I thought was interesting: almost every review from a foreign poster was negative. This engenders the following question: Is this movie too American to be appreciated? I think it may be. Without the American High School experience, you may not be able to relate.

 This is a brilliant, subtle, comedy that is paced with details and satire, and for my money is only slightly behind ""Raising Arizona"" as greatest comedy ever. The character development is OUTSTANDING! This is achieved through clever narrations and adroit irony (a shot of the teacher leading Tracy to his bedroom is covered by a voice over in which she says ""What I really miss is our talks"" and Mr McCallister claims that he really likes Tracy over a shot of her hard-earned signature list in a dumpster). The side issues are delectable and come out of nowhere- the lesbian revenge, the bee sting (not to mention that clever twist that Broderick, as a teacher, has his most memorable role as slacker Ferris Bueller).

 The film is unbelivably percptive. There is a grain of truth in many or the implications: Teachers do dislike some students, some teachers do choose that occupation because they really didn't want to leave HS, and some teachers are manques of some sort who underachieved and may be jealous of overachieving students (""who go to much better colleges"") and that we all often loathe successful people. In other words it shows humans as real and flawed.

 Broderick is, of course, great, but Witherspoon (hwo she did the ""fill me up"" scene with a strait face I'll never know) and Klien, as the credulous jock are equally up to par.

 Ultimately however the stength is the ludicrousness that we all know a high school election to really be. Tammy's speech sums it up and is fantastic.

1056465,5,6305574944,"Don't be deceived by the MTV logo on the box. Election is no ordinary high school movie. It is so far removed from the typical ""teen movie"" that it's sure be viewed with hostility from fans of those dreadfully stereotypical movies. What Election is, however, is a sharp, hilarious, on-target satire of high school life from the point of view of both the students and the teachers. Probably more so from the teachers' point of view, as the film focuses on Jim McAllister, played to perfection by Matthew Broderick as a man so stuck in the routine his daily life that director Alexander Payne visually compares him to a caged rat. He is a popular teacher who really desires to help his students, but is overcome by his spite for over-achieving student Tracy Flick. Reese Witherspoon (possibly giving the best performance of her career) has created a truly memorable character with Tracy Flick. Everybody knows someone like her, and is either irritated by her or exactly the same as her. Witherspoon's luminous performance is the heart of the film.
The story is pretty simple and revolves around Mr. McAllister's contempt for Tracy which leads  him to attempt to sabotage her chances of being class president. The real meat of the film, however, is the characterization. Director Payne gets us deep into the minds of the characters, and lets us know their innermost thoughts, desires and regrets. Typical teen and high school movies rarely have characters this deep and fleshed out. Election is essentially a character study in which we see three or four main characters deal with issues of morality and conduct. Jim McAllister is dissatisfied with his job and his marriage, Tracy Flick is dissatisfied with her obsessiveness and ambition. Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) is dissatisfied with being a dim-bulb football player, and Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell) is dissatisfied that the girl she loves ditched her for her brother.
It could be said that Election is about any number of things: The rigors of high school life, the consequences of one's actions, the corruption of politics, the impossibility of changing destiny, being envious and jealous towards others, the tedium of one's career, or just being miserable. Everyone will take something different away from it. That's one thing that's great about it. The themes are implicit and require interpretation on the part of the viewer. Personally, I think it's an indictment of obsessive ambition, represented equally by the Jim McAllister and Tracy Flick characters.
Alexander Payne is a brilliant director. No other film director that I know of can so effectively find profundity in the simplicity of every day occurrences. His films focus on small town life (usually Omaha, Nebraska since that's where he's from) and dissect the ins and outs of every day life. He manages to bring out profound questions that spring up from the inanity and frustrations of life. In addition to Election, he made another brilliant movie called About Schmidt starring Jack Nicholson. It's a film which again philosophically explores the tedium and rituals of ordinary life in Middle America.
Election is a sharp, biting character study that is immensely deeper than the average high school movie. It makes the viewer question the choices they've made and will make in the future. It features Oscar-worthy performances by Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, is expertly directed, has brilliant sharp dialog and a look and feel of authenticity that isn't usually found in high school movies. By looking at the lives of these flawed people, we can perhaps learn something about ourselves and our life decisions.",1085529600,2,3648,5.1003344481605355

The redemption of this film is found in Witherspoon's acting and the fact that all the criminals in the film got their just punishment.

1056467,3,6305574944,"Election is a very difficult movie to classify and review.  With staple actors from the teen pulp genre, like Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein, it would be easy to write it off as merely another school holiday flick.  However, the issues dealt with include sexual relationships between teacher and student, and marital infidelity; subjects more suited to adult fare.
The story is centred around an ambitious and perfect student (Witherspoon), and the teacher (a woefully miscast Matthew Broderick - stick to the slapstick, buddy) who decides to meddle with destiny and stop the rise and rise of Tracy Flick.  His solution?  To persuade another, more popular student to run against Tracy in the all-important election for student president.  What he doesn't foresee is how the election will change his own life forever.
It is a comedy that works very well in some places.  Never again will one be able to consider a cupcake, without thinking of the 280 ""Pick Flick"" personalised cupcakes.  And the collection of sports jocks, nerds and sundry other students, whilst highly stereotypical, are good for a few laughs.  It is when the movie *tries* to be funny that it fails.  A bit of special-effects make-up slapped on to resemble a bee-stung eyelid isn't all that amusing, and seems out of character with the rest of the film.  Another notable aspect is the voiceovers done by the characters.  These are funny and very clever, in that the viewer gets a lot more by reading between the lines, than taking what is said at face value.

1056469,5,6305574944,"Election explores sensitive moral and ethical issues within the framework of a bawdy, dark comedic script. Early in the film, Matthew Broderick's character, teacher Jim McAllister, asks his class, ""What's the difference between morals and ethics anyway?"" Election presents wonderful examples that show the difference through real-life conflicts.
The primary conflict revolves around student Tracy Flick's campaign for Student Council President. Flick is the quintessential Type-A over-achiever who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Jim McAllister attempts to thwart her campaign through the careful selection of a running mate, school jock Paul Metzler. Tensions rise as the two students compete with McAllister quietly vying for Metzler's victorious win. When the election takes a surprising turn for the worse, McAllister takes matters into his own hands by manipulating the situation to construct his own vision of how the election should end. This re-emphasizes an early lesson McAllister taught his students involving morals.
The movie is rich with sub-plots that play on the morals vs. ethics theme. The storyline is layered with conflicts such as Paul Metzler's adopted sister, Tammy, who struggles with her own sexuality, academic problems, and family pressures. Jim McAllister suffers through serious fidelity problems in his marriage. Paul Metzler plays the victim between two conflicts involving his sister and the election as a whole. These situations are cast within a comedic structure that contain serious dramatic underpinnings.
While the movie portrays the lives of high school students, it is not a film for the whole family. The humor contains strong sexual content involving serious adult themes. For those expecting a fun movie for your children, this is not the film. For those looking for a ""chick flick,"" the sexual references may be too intense. The humor is scoped towards the male mind and may leave female viewers offended or uncomfortable due to the graphic sexual innuendos.
Sexual references aside, Election is a classic movie acted by an interesting cast of seasoned professionals and newbie actors.  The script is solid, funny, and the movie very well paced and directed.  The characterization builds well due to the selection of talented actors, each who fit their role believably. Reese Witherspoon becomes Tracy Flick; Chris Klein becomes Paul Metzler. It's hard to imagine others who might play those roles better. Other characters are equally believable and Broderick's performance is superb.
During the making of the film, realism was foremost in the mind of director Alexander Payne. It was filmed on location in Payne's hometown, Omaha, Nebraska. The school footage was shot in Papillion-LaVista High School just outside of Omaha.  Classroom scenes were filmed during school hours, which provided a natural, real-life backdrop. Adjacent rooms had actual classes taught during filming. Ambient noise during these scenes were not added, they are the sounds of a school in session. Extras were students who attend the high school.
The DVD contains some added features, the best of which is audio commentary by Alexander Payne. There are deleted scenes that exist but were regretfully not included on the DVD release.
Election holds-up well with continued viewings. For those who are not offended by its style of humor, this movie won't become a forgotten addition to the DVD collection. It's a bright movie worthy of repeat performances.",1065484800,,3485,5.414364640883978

1056471,5,6305574944,"As if ""American Pie"" wasn't realistic enough, here's ""Election,"" an amazingly accurate and very funny film about high school elections. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this film is that it was made by MTV, which seems to be the catalyst for conformity, though their movies (Joe's Apartment, Orange County among others) don't show it. This is a film that knows what's popular and strikes out against it. It couldn't have worked better.
Matthew Broderick plays Mr. McAllister, a social studies teacher at George Washington Carver High School and runner of the student government. The incredibly lovely Reese Witherspoon plays Tracy Flick, an over-achiever who seems destined for Student Body President.
Since Day 1, it seems, she's been campaigning. She's on yearbook staff, president of many clubs, a reporter for the TV channel, and probably tons of other things. And while she seems nice on the outside, under that layer lies a perfectionist so intent on getting just what she wants that she'll step on anyone to get it. Under that layer is yet another, which is her true colors. She's lonely. Tracy, despite her decided popularity, has no friends. Soon she is ""in love"" with a teacher at the school (who is also Mr. McAllister's best friend) and now the teacher must resign.
McAllister does not want Flick to become president. He does not want what happened to his friend to happen to him. He enlists Paul (Chris Klein, giving his best performance), a likable football player whose sport career is ruined by a broken leg while skiing. One would expect this character to be a real jerk, but on the inside he's a tender, generous, and lovable guy. True, he may not be the most intelligent person, but he's very sincere.
Also running is Paul's sister Tammy, who loves people for the person, not for their looks. She also remarks that the only people she's ever loved are girls. She decides to run after Paul takes her girlfriend. Paul is completely unaware of his sister's alternative lifestyle, but we know it wouldn't matter if he did. He really cares for his sister and, in her own way, she cares for her brother.
The whole movie is absolutely zany. There are tons of subplots, but all of the characters have enough screentime for us to really get to know them. The comedy comes at full force, but it's different from the comedy in other teen-oriented movies. This humor feels more down-to-earth and genuine.
If you haven't seen ""Election"" and are in high school or older, you must. It's absolutely brilliant. Perfectly written, directed with tactful attentiveness and well paced. It sucks you in from the beginning and allows you to rethink your high school experience. MTV Productions didn't stop there, though. After seeing ""Election,"" check out ""Orange County,"" a quasi-similar movie with the same feel for high school and the same comedic timing. Do enjoy!",1053043200,6,2871,4.909465020576132
1056495,5,6305574944,"Election is intelligent in it's humor, painfully accurate in it's satirical critique, and troubling in it's conclusions. Is infidelity okay if ""true love"" is the reason? What if the lovers are teacher and high school student? And if it's not okay, who's fault is it? Is ambition wrong? Can people--especially young people--ever really ""overachieve""? Election critiqued the sloppy morals of society. However, I also sensed a resignation, a hopelessness. Is it really too much to expect righteousness from one another? Thus, by movie's end, I was troubled.
The acting was top-notch. Flick was indeed the prototypical--yet believable--overachieving student--from a low-middle income one-parent family to boot! The quarterback-turned-politician, was wonderful--a good-hearted, popular, optimistic young man of barely average intelligence. ""Mr. M"" was most convincing in his slide from teacher-hero to hypocrite, adulterer, and thief. Other minor characters also fleshed out this tale convincingly.
Election is a story of moral flabbiness that plays out hilariously, suspensefully, and almost realistically. Satire, of course, must push the edges of believability, and this film finds the perfect balance. The bottom-line is that this is a story that gives much food for thought, and can be quite entertaining. The acting is A+!
P.S. One caveat is that those who disapprove of sexual alternatives and promiscuity being portrayed minus outright condemnation will want to avoid this movie.",1046563200,,1482,5.740909090909091
1056496,4,6305574944,"In a film whose most disturbing moments make ""Clerks"" look like a morality tale, director Alexander Payne makes all the right moves to please those who appreciate what has been absent in so many of today's teen comedy misfires: HUMOR.
Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon shine as the veteran civics teacher and classic overachiever, respectively. Chris Klein does about all he can as the sickeningly sweet, leadenly dumb Paul Metzler (you Betzler!), which for this movie serves quite well. Also in good form is the actress who plays Paul's sexually confused sister Tammy, whose name eludes me at the moment.
If there's one drawback to the film, it's that the heavy dose of sexual deviance takes a while to get used to. Once you've gotten into it though, you can't help but laugh. The sharp writing and excellent music score (particularly the song played whenever Tracy sees Paul's poster) make this a cinematic yahtzee.
By the way, the DVD sucks, so just get this one on VHS.

1056499,5,6305574944,"At the start of ""Election,"" Jim McAllister tells viewers how well his life is going.  He's a dedicated and popular social studies teacher at Carver High School in Omaha, with a loving wife and a best friend on the faculty.  By the film's end, Jim has been fired from his job, become a national laughingstock, been divorced by his wife for infidelity, and moved to New York City.  Why?  It all starts with Tracy Flick.
Tracy, played in career-defining fashion by Reese Witherspoon, is a running for student-government president at Carver.  She's an odd mix of youthful naivete; barely suppressed resentment at slights both real and imagined; and a pure Machiavellian drive to succeed.  She's also having an affair with Jim's math-teacher best friend Dave, whose extracurricular activities get him fired early in the movie.
Concerned about the effects of Tracy's reckless ambition and bitter over his friend Dave's firing, Jim develops an unhealthy obsession with her (the scene where Tracy appears in Jim's head while he's being intimate with his wife is one of the most consistently funny in movie history).  Determined to halt Tracy's rise, Jim decides to recruit popular ex-jock Paul Metzler to oppose her in the election.  Paul, brilliantly portrayed by Chris Klein, is everything Tracy isn't: innocent, wide-eyed, naive, and slow-witted, with a penchant for vacant stares and extremely stupid comments.  Paul's lesbian sister Tammy also decides to enter the race, bitter over her brother's theft of a girl's affections.
What follows is one of the most brilliantly satirical movies I've had the pleasure of seeing.  Although the central event of ""Election"" may be a high-school election, it might as well be a presidential race.  Carver High becomes a microcosm for the world in general, with the election as the backdrop for a sordid tale of lust, betrayal, power, ambition, and resentment.  Jim (is there any doubt that this is Matthew Broderick's best role?) may sound idealistic at the start of the movie, but by the end he's gotten dirtier than anyone else.  In fact, out of the principal characters in the movie only Paul really comes out clean.
""Election"" is, without a doubt, one of the most well-crafted comedies of recent years.  Much like ""The Simpsons"" in its prime, the movie is brilliant in its vulgarity and unpredictability.  The main characters are fully realized and realistic, and the actors (Klein especially) can wring laughs out of even the tiniest facial expression.  The humor is often off-color, but never in a stupid teen-movie sort of way.  ""Election"" is a reminder of how funny a movie can be when it relies on little things like wit and creativity.  I try to be pretty careful with my five-star ratings, but ""Election"" would get a hundred out of a hundred from me.",1041033600,36,2796,4.989224137931035
1056500,5,6305574944,"""Election"" is the type of movie that you thoroughly enjoy the first time you see it, and then you *have* to watch it if you are flipping through the channels and see it being played on cable.
Matthew Broderick plays Jim McCalister, well meaning but ultimately weak individual, who is in charge of the presidential election at G.W. Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska.  The election seems like a lock for ultimate overachiever Tracy Flick (Withersoon) until McCalister's resentment towards Flick inspires him to convince popular jock Paul (Chris Klein) to enter the race.  From there, things take one hilarious turn after the next.
Great movies are those that tell a story in an interesting and unique way, and Director Alexander Payne does not fail to live up to this expectation.  ""Election"" is a fascinating look at one character who has failed to create a fulfilling, successful life for himself (Broderick) and one character (Witherspoon) who is doing all she can to ensure she will have a fulfilling, successful life.
The DVD is great, with a nice, interesting commentary from Payne who explains a lot of the details that you may miss from viewing the film.  Don't let the fact that this movie takes place in a high school fool you - this is an adult film that realistically captures high school life.  The look of the film is great, and it's one of the few films that make places, people, and things look like REAL PEOPLE rather than sets, actors, and props.
The movie gets 5 stars; the DVD gets 4 1/2.  While the commentary is great, Payne talks about scenes that were shot but not included in the film that would've been nice if they were included as a ""Deleted Scenes"" feature.",1040601600,,1688,4.724489795918367

Okay, Matthew Broderick is really good here, and so are the others to a lesser extent.  But this movie belongs to Witherspoon's Flick and director Alexander Payne.  In other hands, this might have been a goofy teen comedy.  But under Payne's excellent direction, it becomes a steel-eyed battle between Witherspoon and Broderick.

1056504,5,6305574944,"The film ""Election"" is a hilarious, sharp satire which pokes fun at politics in general and high school and suburban life in particular. In the film we meet high school teacher, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick in one of his best roles)who is presiding over the Student Government elections. He's one of those teachers who is popular with the students and will always go, that extra mile to try to make a postive difference in their lives. That is until he meets up with Tracy Flick (well played by Reese Witherspoon),who is running unopposed for SGA president. Tracy has one of those really annoying Type-A personalities and will stop at nothing to get what she wants, no matter who she hurts.

1056561,5,6305574944,"I can vividly recall the promotional campaign behind ELECTION during its initial 1999 release; I thought it was going to be a rollicking teen comedy focusing on Reese Witherspoon's character seducing teachers for purposes of entrapment- the MTV Films label reinforced such a notion. How wrong I was. The plot was not as simple as that, the movie was not just another rote entry in the youth genre (not that there's anything wrong with another rote entry in the youth genre; those films can be a lot of fun). ELECTION, however, is much more highbrow than one might think.
Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, high school teacher. His is an ordinary life, benign, happy, seemingly fulfilled. He's married to a loving, gentle wife, he likes his job, loves the kids he teaches, he's completely ensconced in the normal environs of suburban tranquility. Until Tracy Enid Flick comes along.
Miss Flick is a go-getter, pure and simple. It's not that she's necessarily more cerebral than everyone else- she's not so smart that she'll someday cure a disease or design a novel jet propulsion system- but she is uncannily unflappable and incredibly ambitious. She was born with an extremely active overachiever gland, and she has no problem using it.
Mr. McAllister is in charge of the school election system. Miss Flick is interested in winning the election. But Jim isn't so sure she deserves to win. When no one else enters the race, he decides to convince former football prodigy Paul Metzler- played by Chris Klein of the AMERICAN PIE features- to run against her; he convinces the laidback, easygoing Metzler that one person running in an election constitutes a quasi-dictatorship. But there's more going on here; Jim can't stand Flick for many reasons, including the fact that the teaching career of his best friend Dave was sidelined due to an affair he initiated with the susceptible straight-A coed. Once McAllister pokes his nose into the affairs of the election, a chain reaction is catalyzed into motion- one which seals his fate and precipitates one of the worst, most tragic downfalls in cinematic history.
One of the greatest strengths of Alexander Payne's ELECTION is its use of multiple-viewpoint voiceover; each character involved in the evolving mess gets to share his/her thoughts and observations, which makes for an efficient method of telling the story. Watching as convolution yields to yet more convolution- and spying on the ever-encroaching storm which threatens to decimate McAllister's life- proves to be an exercise in sustained fulfillment.
There are many themes and statement present in the piece. The two worlds of teachers and students coexisting in the same locale day-in/day-out always provides useful fodder for complex examination. Broderick's character sees great threat in Flick; granted, he has the understandable motivation in the ruination of his crony, but he also sees yet another type-A extrovert who will go on to future endeavors which will easily surpass his lot in life. On the other side of the mirror, we see the life of the students, more sophisticated than any of us probably assign credit for; we like to think that the bodies of classmates are only interested in getting a quality education, and when they are not, they are up to riffraff activities which, on the whole, amount to indiscretions which are wholly minor in nature. Well, we know such a statement is fanciful and misguided; student bodies are intense sociological dynamics which are every bit as political and rancorous as a national presidential campaign, which is why the use of the election process in the film as the focal point of the arc is very apt both structurally and allegorically. Seeing the results of McAllister's fiddling might teach us two lessons: 1) teachers should stay out of student affairs, and 2) perhaps holding educational elections in school isn't as advisable as one might think; perhaps, instead of being educational, it brings on the corruption that much sooner.
ELECTION is not just a civics lesson, however. If you want laughs, there are a lot to be had; Payne effectively sprinkles several belly-scream sequences throughout the proceedings. And he extracts some pristine performances from the entire cast- even the tertiary players shine through. At first, I thought Broderick was going to be a pale echo of his Ferris Bueller character; in fact, that was my initial cynical impression when I first heard of this title: John Hughes's most famous creation as a teacher. But I never once thought of Bueller while watching, not once; Broderick truly succeeded (unlike his failure in the GODZILLA remake). And the very fetching Reese Witherspoon was, as Carson Daly once pointed out, the only person who made sense for her role; she projected the exact demeanor needed for the character, a sort of unselfconscious, controlled display of harried, ladder-climbing desire.
There's no dispute concerning this ELECTION...it is the clear winner...",1025308800,4,4980,5.119164619164619

So he persuades another student to stand for election. Enter Chris Klein who along side Witherspoon and Broderick is a great combination of actors.

1056563,5,6305574944,"Election is just about wittiest, wickedest comedy concerning teenagers ever made. It is clever in a way that makes it appealing to far more than just the teen market. In fact, older viewers will perhaps be the most amused by it, because the central theme of Election has a timeless quality to it.
Matthew Broderick is Jim McAllister, who has taught at the local high school for a dozen years. McAllister is the type of likable person who finds a comfortable niche is life and is content to spend the rest of his life doing basically the same thing. He's been voted teacher of the year three or four times. He's even married to his high school sweetie. Ambitious people are a turn off to him. Overly ambitious types actually intimidate him, even if their lust for power does not directly affect him. McAllister is a character we've all met.
Tracy Flick [Reese Witherspoon] is as ambitious as they come. She's been groomed by her protective mother, who writes to people like Oprah Winfrey and Janet Reno asking them for advice for her daughter. Now in her senior year, Tracy has decided to run for president of the student body. She is unopposed.
McAllister cannot stand Tracy. He finds her quite dangerous. So he talks a popular football player, who has been sidelined with a broken leg, to run for the office. Paul [Chris Klein] is the classic nice guy, which means that, in modern politics, he is clueless about what is in store for him. Meanwhile, out of spite, his own sister, Tammy [Jessica Campbell], decides to enter the race, too. All hell is about to break loose.
Matthew Broderick is excellent, but it is the young Reese Witherspoon, a star in the making, who steals the picture. Her portrayal of Tracy is one of this year's most insightful. Tracy is all perky and smiley, but the moment she is alone, her face turns into a scowl. She is basically lonely, but like all power-hungry people, she has no idea why she has no real friends. Witherspoon gives Tracy a clipped, no nonsense voice. She sounds like every pushy, self-centered person you ever met, and she brings a knowing, if somewhat pained, smile to your face whenever she talks.
The movie has all sorts of interesting characters and interesting plot turns. Like in all great black comedies, being a good person doesn't mean one always wins in the end. Unlike in real politics, there's never a dull moment in this Election. While it appears to take place in a somewhat surreal world, its truths are exceptionally real. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, the kind that will be just as fresh twenty years from now.",1016668800,,2589,4.642701525054466

She plays a ruthless motivated teenager who wants to be elected student body president, who stops at nothing to see that she wins.  Matthew Broderick plays a teacher who knows her antics and stops at nothing to see that she doesn't win.  The movie is intelligent and witty. Not what you'd expect to see in a ""teenager"" film.

1056565,5,6305574944,"If theres one thing that Election states more clearly than anything else its that not all movies with teenagers in them are teen movies.  Election is in fact a witty, biting and often hilarious satire of the rivalry and corruption in governmental elections.  In it the audience is introduced to determined go-getter Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), a student who is determined to be president of the student body council.  Her teacher Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) on the other hand, both attracted and repulsed by Tracy, decides to enter popular jock Paul (Chris Klein) into the running.  Before you know it his angst-ridden younger sister Tammy has also joined the race to get back at school friend Lisa, who spurned her sexual advances.
This microcosm of the real world is ingenious, allowing for plenty of similarities to be drawn between the characters and real political figures.  However, this isn't just a satire.  It is a movie that allows its audience to empathise with it characters, whether its Tracy wondering why no-one has signed her yearbook, Paul upset about his skiing accident or Tammy sitting staring at the local power plant in quiet contemplation, you're moved.  Even Mr. McAllister, whose life just spirals more and more out of control the more he tries to get a firm grip on it.  The film also looks at adults envy for the younger generation and the question of how far a person should go to pursue their dream of happiness  is it even existent?

1056567,4,6305574944,"Oh, what can I say about this smart, scathing satire that had me laughing just as hard on the fourth viewing as the first? Like any great story, it's about more than it pretends. That it happens to be a comedy is beside the point; this is terrific filmmaking, period.
If you have any doubts, listen to director Alexander Payne's commentary track. This film was made by someone who had really thought the material through, and who actually bothered to apply some inventive cinematic design to many of its sequences. That's more than can be said for most comedies, and certainly more than can be said for any recent teen flick.
Though made well before these things happened, the plot of Election - which concerns the election of a student government president in an Omaha high school - uncomfortably echoes the 2000 Presidential Election mess here in the United States, with loud accusations of class envy, bad sportsmanship, and vote-fixing:
Over-achieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is like Al Gore - a seeming ""natural"" for the post, whose whole life has been directed to the goal of winning elected office. Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), the rich, dumb, but good-hearted kid who opposes her could easily be...well, you get the idea. There is even a ""spoiler"" candidate (Metzler's sister Tammy, played by Jessica Campbell) who could easily represent every Libertarian or Independent who ever threw a wrench in the works by dividing a traditional voter base, thereby allowing the opposition to win.
But the central character of Election is Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a teacher who tries to manipulate the outcome, he says (and perhaps really believes), for the Common Good. The Dumb Guy is his puppet, Tracy Flick his victim - although really, no one in this film escapes playing both roles at one time or another. Not even McAllister himself, who gets a satisfying, hilariously appropriate comeuppance.
Election is also one of those rare films that manages to embrace its characters at the same time it reveals their pettiness and absurdity. Unlike Dr. Strangelove (perhaps the greatest political satire of all), it actually likes the people it rather mercilessly destroys with its infernal plot twists. Perhaps it's because the characters really work to destroy themselves. The movie is just content to let them do it, knowing that, in the end, everyone will survive and just continue to live in their own comfortable little fantasy world.
The performances are all perfect; Payne's direction and screen play (co-written with Jim Taylor from a novel by Tom Perrotta) are exceptional.
Though certainly unintended, Election provides us with a glimpse of the future. In time, all historical events attain a kind of distance, like memories of high school for those of us in our 30's. The 2000 election will someday occupy a place like that, too.
And that's when it will start to seem as funny, sad, and ultimately inevitable as the plot of this wonderful film.",1010880000,2,2976,5.026315789473684

1056642,4,6305574944,"Matthew Broderick is fabulous here in his role as a normal teacher in a seemingly normal high school. He is well-liked and has been teacher of the year. He is also the student government advisor, and one day he meets his match in an overly ambitious and almost crazy student Tracy Flick (played to manically realistic proportion by Reese Witherspoon). Broderick is so disturbed by Tracy's blind ambition that he prompts another student, popular football player sidelined by an injury, to run against Tracy in the student government elections. The well-meaning but rather stupid guy (Chris Klein) agrees but has no idea what he is up against. Neither does Broderick. After Klein's character enters the election, his character's lesbian younger sister Tammy also enters the election on a platform of ""don't vote, who cares?"" Tammy would have won by a landslide, but she gets kicked out of school (for admitting to ripping down posters that Tracy really ripped down) and (happily for her) sent to an all girls school. At that point Broderick tries to tamper with the election results. But this is after so many other problems have befallen him in his personal life. It is almost sad to watch the fabric of his life unravel, while Tracy is climbing the social ladder. Particularly at the end of the film. Still, a darkly comic take on high school popularity and ambitions. Really a worthwhile and funny film.",1002585600,2,1404,4.9033613445378155
1056643,2,6305574944,"Election is a black comedy without the laughs. Labeled by the critical mass as a ""biting satire,"" it was first billed as teensploitation when it was released in 00' because it takes place in high school and stars Chris Klein and Reese Witherspoon, the latest fresh faces, but only rationalistic adults, embittered by the hardships of life experience yet misguided by pseudo-intellectualism could appreciate a film this cynical, mean-spirited, and completely lacking in humor.
Part of the problem is that Election focuses on an evil, unappealing main character, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) instead of spending time on a supporting character, Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell) who brings an understated brilliance to the film in her short scenes. Small beautiful moments worthy of applause crop up during this film, but then so much of the rest is a contemptible mess that you shouldn't be surprised if you find yourself applauding and booing within the same twenty minutes. Election switches quite frequently between junk and greatness.
As much as I'm dissing Election, I was weirdly engaged during the whole film.  The high school students, halls, and classrooms of Carver High look real because they are real, and a realistic high school setting is a precious quality rare in most high school movies.  I also enjoyed the crisp cinematography; it makes the film look much cooler than it really is.  That can also be said for the omnicient narrative.  Up until the
conclusion, I felt like I was seeing something realistic, meaningful and scathingly smart.  But during the conclusion and after the end, the more I thought about it, the more I realized how little sense the film makes.  Seeing it for the second time, it became more apparent how ugly it is with hardly no sympathetic
characters and a payoff that leaves the stalest of aftertastes.  In the end, the whole message of Election could be summed up with one banal bumper sticker slogan, ""Mean People Suck."" How ""bitingly"" satirical is that?",999388800,5,2004,5.072948328267477

She is very ambitious and Broderick's character can't stand her. I don't think you've ever seen Broderick this funny or in this kind of role - he's a crack-up (what was he thinking having an affair with that woman???)! I think this has to be Reese's best performance, she is truly one of the great up & coming actresses today and you will love to hate(?) her as Broderick's character does. I don't think I've ever heard my husband laugh as loud as he did in the very last scene (of course, he finds naughty words incredibly funny so that probably explains most of it).",998870400,,875,4.374233128834356

1056677,5,6305574944,"With low expectations, I saw ""Election"" at my university's theater.  I could not have been more pleasantly surprised.  Matthew Broderick portrays the high school teacher pushed over the edge by the overly driven student, Reese Witherspoon.  The best thing about this movie is that anyone can relate to nearly all of the characters.  Matthew Broderick is that ideological teacher who really wanted to make a difference; Reese Witherspoon is the girl everybody hated because she always knew the answer.  Chris Kline is that one super-jock, who manages to be an amazingly nice guy.
Most of the comedy comes from Broderick's hateful obsession with Witherspoon.  This hate drives a good guy to do everything he can to keep Witherspoon from winning the high school Presidential election.  This film thrives on the hilarious characters, all of who will undoubtedly remind you of your high school friends and enemies (one of them will undoubtedly remind you of yourself).
""Election"" is more intelligent, funnier, and more creative than any of the more recent high school nostalgia flicks like ""American Pie.""  I can't say enough positive things about this film, one of the funniest movies of the 90's.",996451200,2,1193,5.1450777202072535
1056678,4,6305574944,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, featuring a fine comedic performance by Reese Witherspoon, who is a natural as goody-goody A-student Tracy Flick (watch the spelling of that last name: the second and third letters have a tendency to fuse, as they do in Tracy's campaign buttons and cupcakes, one of many sight jokes in the movie).  She's a malevolent, scheming little monster who has her heart set on being elected Carver High School's student body president.  Matthew Broderick (back in high school yet again, poor guy) plays Mr. McAllister, a somewhat hapless history and civics teacher who easily discerns her two-faced nature and would like to derail her campaign for the further good of humankind.  So he convinces Paul Metzger (Chris Klein), a popular but dim-witted star athlete with a heart of gold, to run against Tracy.  Unfortunately Mr. McAllister has a few problems of his own that distract him, not the least of which is a wandering libido and an inability to get his wife pregnant.
This is a nearly perfect satire of high school culture that does not pander to a teenaged audience, as does, e.g., American Pie (1999).  The script by director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor from the novel by Tom Perrotta sparkles with wit and keen observations of the way people really are, festooned with some very funny dialogue.  It includes several clever subplots that all work together seamlessly.  I particularly enjoyed the heartache, revenge and resolution of lesbian Tammy Metzger (Jessica Campbell) who maneuvers her way from counter-cultural dweeb to student body fav to the school of her heart's desire.  The scene where she watches the Sacred Heart all-girls school soccer team perform and realizes that's where she REALLY wants to be is just a beautiful piece of movie making.
Payne's direction is smooth and sure-handed with an artist's attention to detail.  The election denouement is well set up and the bee sting that McAllister gets that swells up his right eye is an inspired visual reminder of the ""sting"" planted on him by his friend's ex-wife.  The ending which shows us with apt irony what happens to McAllister and Tracy and Tammy and Paul as they go their separate ways is a delight.",993859200,4,2230,4.906914893617022

Yet, Election shows what a High School is trully like. Now, I'm not saying that It portrays a school perfectally, but it comes close. The class rooms lack windows, the students are real students, and the general enviroment in quite similar.
The movie also points out that it is always those people, those over achievers who do run for president of SGA, however, these same people use others to gain more. Those same people who always thinks they know more than the teacher and deserve more respect. Then the movie also shows an outcast, and also a typical popular person, an over achiever in sports, and gennerally a really nice guy.
The movie also has many ""patterns"". I recomend listening to the auido commentary. You pick up the connections, such as the use of garbarge in the movie.

This movie mocked a girl just because she was a high achiever, not even because she slept with her teacher. It wasn't even like she slept with him to get higher grades or anything, she felt she genuinely loved him. While I don't condone that, I also do not condone the satire upon her for her neat appearance, WASPy looks, and breadth of intelligence. Furthermore, why are they classifying intelligent people as being backstabbers and a threat to society?
Furthermore, the teacher was a pure skank, sleeping with his wife's friend. Why can't there ever be a movie where the guy isn't trying to get in bed with a promiscuous or single girl, and where the girl may actually be praised for her intelligence and not her ability to put out?
I also felt that they were portraying lesbianism as some sort of social taboo, using an underachieving loner girl with no friends as some attempt to make lesbianism look like a disease. What are they trying to say, girls with differing opinions from the female ""norm"" and who don't have lots of boys surrounding them are automatically lesbians?

Even without the real-life endorsement of its acumen, it stands as a deft comment on politics, from the perspective of a high school student government election.

1056685,5,6305574944,"Wow, is this a great movie or what?!?  Reese Witherspoon gives a fantastic barrage of hilariousness, in the ongoing bare-knuckle brawl between herself and Kirsten Dunst to see who is the most gifted young comedienne in America.  Matthew Broderick was a great choice to play her nemesis (actually they are each others' nemeses, but that's another story), and he has several moments when he gets to echo, and to parody, his earlier Ferris Bueller spin on high school.  The supporting actors are all perfect too, especially Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell as the siblings who get pulled into the struggle between Matthew (""Mr. McAllister"") and Reese (""Tracy Flick"").
Tracy Flick is running for the presidency of the George Washington Carver High School student government.  The social commentary, if you're an alert viewer, has already begun -- Carver was a famous African American inventor, but if you scan the crowds in the halls of this school, there isn't a single African American kid to be seen throughout the whole movie.  I'm not sure exactly what this is supposed to mean, except possibly that even an election can only pretend to fairness within the restrictions of its constituency, and if you live in a lily-white suburb, you've already attempted to disassociate yourself from a huge segment of America.
Anyway, Tracy is running with the hilarious slogan ""Pick Flick,"" which calls to mind one of my personal all-time favorite nose-related hobbies.  She is sort of a robotic, albeit intense, figure, programmed to work, and to succeed at all costs, by her hyper-driven mother.  Clearly, if Tracy Flick is ever going to mellow out, that moment lies decades in the future.
Mr. McAllister has mixed feelings about Tracy, because she had been in a torrid romance with a friend of his on the faculty, which ended up being discovered, and of course with the friend being fired.  Beyond that -- Tracy just gives Mr. McAllister the willies.  She's just so driven, so focused, so perfectly programmed to steamroll over anyone in her way...  He can't bring himself to like her, and this leads him to draw Chris Klein's character, the happy-go-lucky, lovable jock Paul, into participating in the election...
The main thing a viewer should bear in mind, watching this film, is the range of situations that come up involving a moral or ethical decision.  Personally, I have never once come even close to making a single moral or ethical decision in my entire life that I'm even slightly proud of, so that gave me kind of an interesting perspective on the whole process...  Anyway, there are a host of situations that emerge during the movie involving ethics and morals, such as 1.)Mr. McAllister's friend (Dave Narodny)'s romance with Tracy, his student; 2.)Mr. McAllister's decision (made while watching pornography) to get in Tracy's way in the election by getting Paul involved; 3.)Paul's sister Tammy's decision to run in the election, just to drive a former friend/lover of hers up a wall; 4.)The school principal's visceral dislike of Tammy's rebellious attitude, which prompts him to suspend her from school just because he dislikes her attitude; 5.)Tracy destroying all the election posters in the halls, when she suddenly snaps under all the stress, and then trying to cover it up, even if it means trying to pin the blame on the school's potheads 6.)Mr. McAllister's own romance with his neighbor's (okay, ex-) wife, although at the same time he's trying to get his own wife pregnant; 7.)Paul and Tracy's respective decisions about whether they should vote for themselves; and 8.)Mr. McAllister's completely unforgivable choice to throw out ballot slips, to tilt the election in favor of Paul.
These decision give shape to the whole movie.  It's worth watching them and mulling them over.  The whole movie is just very well put together, and there seem to be a number of statements being made about karma coming full circle as well, which is why I called this review ""fearful symmetry.""
This movie is absolutely worth owning.  Two thumbs up.",985478400,5,4047,5.001488095238095
1056686,5,6305574944,"'Election' is a rather original film (certainly, I haven't seen anything like it before). Using a high school student council presidential election as a metaphor, it successfully satirises real politics.
Am I completely weird because I actually sympathise with all three of the potential candidates, even (*gasp*) the overachiever Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon)? As one of those kids who waved his hand frantically in the air at school when no-one else knew the answer and got ignored by the teacher, I can identify with her desire to shine and frustration with others (though I obviously can't condone much of her petulant, scheming and positively obsessive behaviour). Likewise, her jock opponent (Paul Metzler) deserves sympathy because he is being manipulated so much and is the straight-man in a collection of schemers - having a conscience the size of Jupiter, I can identify with that as well. Finally, his sister Tammy's rebellious denunciation of the whole electoral process and vow to put an end to it struck a chord as well - I regard student politics as something as a waste of time (teachers really don't have to listen to student bodies, as Tammy says) and a playground for people seeking attention and/or a career in politics.
Well, now that I've shocked and dismayed numerous readers and probably made myself an object of scorn and derision, here's some more stuff about the film. I thought Matthew Broderick's performance as the teacher was excellent (as were those of the three candidates). The character was thoroughly unlikeable, a hypocrite whose extramarital affair with his best friend's ex-wife mirrored the relationship with said best friend that he condemned Tracy for. Likewise with his manipulation of the election.
The film as a whole worked beautifully, the story flowed well and the mixing of perspectives of the various characters was good. I particularly liked the prayers of Tracy, Paul and Tammy the night before the election and the sort of epilogue where we found out what happened to the four main characters (it was interesting that the person who appeared to have won the day  possibly came of worst in the end - a message perhaps that success does not equal happiness).
All in all, a very clever film, well deserving of much more attention than it received when released.",982195200,11,2313,5.039164490861618
1056763,5,6305574944,"Election, staring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick, is not your typical teen high school drama, but rather an interesting twist on a high school student government election.  The predominant theme is mocking government and the election process by a high school election, which mirrors exaggerations of American political reality with a definite focus on many prevalent elements of the 1992 election.  The movie also encompasses intergenerational political views, as well as, parallels to reality.  Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon), who is running for Student Government President, exemplifies the typical high school overachiever so obsessed with perfection that she does not care what she does in her climb to the top.  She has sexual relations with her teacher; he loses his job but she escapes unscathed.  This illustration of the increase in acceptance of sexual freedom among younger generations is found is a reoccurring theme: lesbian relations and premarital sexual relations are portrayed as being acceptable among youth while sex leads to the downfall of each adult character who gets caught up in it.  Tracey slanders classmates in her election speech (a typical political scheme to dig up ""dirt""). While all this is taking place, there is a strong intergenerational conflict between Tracey and Mr. M. (Matthew Broderick).  Mr. M. does not understand Tracey's overwhelming drive, inability to be satisfied, and disregard for hurting anyone in her way to the top.  Conversely, Tracey does not understand how Mr. M. can be happy in a job where he knows that the people he is teaching will end up moving on to bigger and better things then himself.  Mr. M. resents Tracy for the sexual affair that she had with the other teacher who was a friend of his.  Because he does not trust her, he successfully encourages Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), the most popular student in the school, to run against her.  Paul's character is the opposite extreme of Tracy's.  He is the stereotypical, fun loving, considerate, somewhat dumb, jock that gets everything handed to him.  He is such a nice guy that he even votes for Tracy because he feels weird about voting for himself (after all what's one vote matter).  He is the pinnacle of both the ideal high school social elite and the merit system in America. Focusing primarily on political themes in the movie, we see there is a great deal to explore.  Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell), the third party candidate, is not only the satirical character of Ross Perot, but is used to embody the political views of the younger generation who do not trust politics and who do not take them seriously.  Tammy even goes so far as to promise the disbanding of the student government upon her election in order to prevent the students from having to sit through anymore dull election speeches.  This gets an incredibly favorable response from the student body.  It should be noted that Perot spoke out against the government and election process just as Tammy did.  Ultimately, Tammy is disqualified for the candidacy symbolizing Ross Perot's virtual disqualification because of his status as a third party candidate.  With Tammy disqualified, the election comes down to two candidates: Tracey and Paul.  Come Election Day, (a Tuesday, of course) when the votes are counted, it is found that Tracey won by a single vote.  A large majority of the votes were thrown out because they were votes for Tammy, who represented the opinion of the masses (government is bad).  Mr. M. has to recount the ballots before the winner can be officially declared.  As he finishes the second count, he sees Tracy hopping around outside the classroom (she had been tipped off after the first count) and becomes so angry that he throws out two votes for Tracey leaving Paul the winner.  The final count is done by the principle, who gets the same count that Mr. M. does.  This is a display of how easily those with too much power can corrupt the system.  The student in charge of the count claims that two votes for Tracy are missing but is quickly dismissed as being wrong (an obvious display of how adults assume adolescents are irresponsible, not trustworthy, and do not know what they are talking about in regard to politics).  In the end, Mr. M's immoral decision to throw away votes is exposed by the janitor and Tracey wins by a single vote.  Had Paul voted for himself he would have won.  Thus we see that one vote does make a difference and that you have to look out for yourself because altruism gets you nowhere in politics. Overnight, everyone finds out about the dishonest thing that Mr. M did and, as in reality, all his successful accomplishments are forgotten so he moves to New York City to start a new life.  In the last scene we see Mr. M is on a vacation in Washington D.C. and notices Tracey getting into a limo with a man in a business suit.  At this point he claims he feels sorry for her and does not hold a grudge.  Upon realizing that the man must be a congressman or some other person of distinction, rage and disgust at her ruthlessness overwhelm him.  He flings his cup of soda at the limo as it drives away.  When it stops, he runs off into a park.  The movie closes with the same theme that it began with:  the intergenerational conflict regarding both politics and society.",982108800,2,5326,4.813186813186813

Based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, ""Election"" takes place in Omaha, Nebraska, ""Election"" follows the lives of several people at George Washington Carver High Schoool. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" fame) is a popular government teacher who is in charge of supervising student government elections. Tracey Flick (Witherspoon) is a goody-goody two shoes who has participated in almost every extracurricular activity there is.
When a fellow teacher is fired for having an affair with Tracey, Mr. McAllister somehow feels compelled to rain on Tracey's parade by finding someone to run against her in the school's election. When he approaches, Paul, an injured football player (Chris Klein of ""American Pie"") the trouble begins as the election gets very heated. While this is all happening, Mr. McAllister's personal home life is also taking a change as he begins an adulterous affair with his best friend's ex-wife. Who says the Midwestern America doesn't have scandals?
Co-Written and directed by Alexander Payne, ""Election"" ranks as one of the best black comedies in recent years. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, ""Election"" possesses wit and dark humor that makes it irresitible not to watch. Practically flawless in direction, ""Election"" is a great satire on the dirtiness involved in politics. There are no ""chads"" or ""recounts"" in this film, however it does possess the excitement of a real-life election.
The entire cast was great, especially Jessica Campbell, who play's Paul's anti-social lesbian sister Tammy, who seeks vengeance after a bad breakup with her girlfriend. Overall this film ranks as one of the best of 1999. I was only disappointed that the original theatrical trailer was not included on the DVD version. Regardless, this is a must see film, especially in the light of the last U.S. Presidential Election fiasco.",978048000,5,2272,5.159891598915989
1056765,5,6305574944,"Who would have thought that the director of ""Citizen Ruth"" would have as his next project this sparkling gem of a dark comedy?  Alexander Payne really knows how to take you in and keep you there. This is not the belly laugh comedy the ads would have you believe.
It's more of a ""Drop Jaw"" kind of thing, although there are plenty of said belly laughs within. Reese witherspoon is so good that she could have easily pulled this off alone. Lucky for us, the entire cast seems as equally gifted under the confident hands of Payne.  There is so much bright dialog (Payne also did the screenplay from the novel) and kooky editing that I will have to see this more than twice just to appreciate it all.  Matthew Broderick has perfected another complex character, and this is easily one of his most adorable roles.
I don't generally relish comedies with so many morose overtones (loneliness, impotance, infidelity and greed to name just a few), but this film is executed so skillfully that everything works perfectly. Of course everybody doesn't have to watch this more than once, but you will most likely want to.",977097600,2,1107,4.666666666666667
1056766,1,6305574944,"I was utterly shocked at how awful this film is. When I saw it in the theater, I must say I was expecting something very different. They did a lot of spin in the advertising campaign, that's for sure.
I've watched a LOT of movies in my day, including plenty of sex-oriented teen comedies (anyone remember ""The Last American Virgin"" from the 80's?). These days, though, I want to see something redemptive in a movie. I want to see characters - even ONE - change for the better. I want to see people learn lessons. If there are a lot of nasty deeds being done - whether they be sexual, drug-induced, hate-filled, whatever - I want to see someone regret something they've done, learn from their mistakes, you know?
Unfortunately, if you like any of those things, you will HATE ""Election."" Because it's a one-way trip down a hellish slope of depravity for (essentially) three main characters, and for virtually everyone else in the movie, too.
Matthew Broderick plays a high-school teacher who gets sick of watching Reese Witherspoon's snobby character, Tracy, getting her way all the time. He also plays a man who (like others in this film) couldn't care less about being faithful in his marriage. Again, it's not that I'm a prude, but it isn't like Broderick's character is any better off at the end of this movie than he was before he made the MANY mistakes he does here.
Anyway, this movie centers around the school's election for president of the student government and how several people will go to any (and I mean ANY) lengths to win it. Tracy wants it and Jim McAllister (Broderick) hates the fact that she'll probably get it. So he ends up backing another political candidate, a rather dim jock, to try and derail her campaign.
What transpires during the movie is a dizzying display of pathetic behavior by each character, either driven by lust, ambition, or hatred...each episode tops the one before it on the Depravity scale. We watch several people start out fairly sane at the beginning of ""Election,"" and witness their downward spiral throughout the next hour and 40 minutes.
At the end of all this, as we watch each character basically self-destruct, does anybody walk away a better person? No. Has anyone figured anything out? Hell no! It's a very unsatisfying ending, and the only reason I stuck this entire movie out when I saw it in the theater was because I kept saying, ""Surely this HAS to get better! These people MUST learn SOMEthing out of all this atrociousness?"" But they don't, trust me.
Cynical? Hardly. This is way beyond that. It's downright bitter, sick, and twisted. I don't understand why so many people seem to have enjoyed this film...it's a pretty sad indication of where America is going. If anything, this movie shouldn't be listed as a comedy. It's depressing.
Lots of people may say that this is precisely the sort of statement that the writers and director were trying to make, that this supposed satire is showing us exactly what NOT to do. Sorry, that's a load of garbage. ""The Simpsons"" have managed to do exactly that for over a decade now - and it still makes me laugh, and usually ends with a positive message.
Trust me, for THIS ""Election,"" no recount is needed. It sucks. It's a total waste of time. No, it's WORSE than a waste of time because you leave this movie worse off than when you started watching it.",975888000,13,3354,4.676818950930626

Brilliant.  Reese Witherspoon is PERFECT( as her character, Tracy, always has to be) in her part, and Matthew Broderick takes a turn from ""Ferris Bueller.."" 's student to a teacher who's life becomes totally destroyed because of the election.  The movie twists and turns in ways you'll never expect.  Scenes like the three main characters( Tracy, Paul, and Tammy) saying their prayer on the night before election becomes an instant classic for ""most remembered lines"".

1056771,5,6305574944,"Elction's not your typical explotaive teen film that's become so prevolent these days, it's a smart social satire that analyzes high school politics both figuratively and literally.  Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon star as teacher and student.  She's an over-achieving go-getter steamrolling towards the class presidency when Mr. M (Broderick) decides to intercede by enlisting the most popular kid in school (played by Chris Klein in a sure-fire star-making turn).  His resentment towards her is deep and he believes non-existant but it stems from an inappropriate relationship she had with his best friend and collegue.  As their bitter realtionship is playing out Broderick finds himself fighting a two-front war with his wife as well.  You see he got himself in over his head after persuing a relationship with his friend's ex whom he'd left behind after the divorce.  Everything's played out in a light-hearted kind of way which makes it increasingly enjoyable and worthy of repeat viewing.  It's a movie that I always knew was good but it just kept growing on me until now I consider it the best of '99.  Broderick & Witherspoon both would've been worthy Oscar contenders and Klein whose gone onto superstardom with American Pie plays the part with dead-pan perfection that he eaily runs away with the film's most laughs.  The disc's best feature is the running commentary by Payne whose insights pointed out some of the little details that makes this movie so good.

1056823,5,6305574944,"What kind of people run for public office? If you answered people who want to change the world, you need to run around the block a hundred times, fall on your face a couple of hundred times and live for another ten years. Alternatively, you could watch Alexander Payne's brutal satire which effectively argues that there are only three categories under which all potential candidates fall: 1) Narcissistic, compulsive and ultimately pathetic over-achievers. Represented with horrific accuracy in the film by the detestable Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon). 2) Moronic, albiet popular, pawns controlled by a puppeteer with his/her own alterior motives. The earnest idiots of this category are accurately embodied in the form of Paul Metzler(Chris Klein) with endearing ineptitude. 3) Disillusioned idealistic outcasts who want to get elected just to discredit the painfully rehearsed and pointless electoral process. This rare type of candidate is represented by Paul's lesbian adopted sister, Tammy(Jessica Campbell). Like the filmmakers of Election, Tammy soon recognises the futility of her cause, looks at the whole phenomenon from a different angle and finds the whole thing funny. Oh yes, Election is a very funny film.
  Like the best of films, Election never stretches to make its point(s). If you haven't heard of it, you may be surprised to learn that its events largely transpire in a High School where the seemingly model Civics and History teacher, Mr. Jim McAllister is suffering the muted symptoms of early middle age anxiety(shades of American Beauty) and visible agititation at the ravenous academic success of Tracy Flick. He hates her, its as simple as that. She's gotten his best friend fired after a torrid affair, knows the answers to every question he asks and unlike him, she has a single minded purpose in life. As one of the film's four narrators, McAllister claims to have a happy life and that his relationship with his wife is ""closer then ever"" after nine years. But when he returns home, his head filled with angry thoughts at the malignant Flick, his wife asks ""Anything wrong?"" He replies smiling ""No, nothing."" After years of being the model, bland citizen, I think he's jealous of Tracy Flick. For an actor who's been terminally bland since his days as Ferris Beuller, Broderick's performance as the teacher is a revelation. He effectivly communicates the growing bitterness under McAllister's polite exterior.
  With its depiction of midlife angst, dis-satisfaction and teenage confusion Election is comparible to American Beauty. Where Sam Mendes's Oscar winner adopted a more lyrical,poetic approach, Election goes for acute satire. And like Beauty, it is surprisingly sympathetic to its characters(Even the detestable Flick gets a couple of moments to impersonate a lonely human being.)
  I recently caught Alexander Payne's previous effort, Citizen Ruth on TV. While it has recieved many good reviews, I found the film a little to broad. In Election on the other hand, he seems to be in complete control. His use of multiple narration will remind you of Scorsese's Goodfellas, and like that mafia opus, there are self-contained sequences of sheer brilliance. His use of freeze-frame, frenzied pace(behold the bee sting sequence) and rock tunes on the soundtrack are all on par with Scorsese. This is a director to watch.
  Election is a satire, so the character traits are obviously exaggerated. But in my time in highshool, there was a thoroughly detestable breed of quasi-Tracey Flicks infesting my school's final year. These kid suceeded in being the teacher's pet, the constant organisers of all classroom activities while simaltanously trying to appear down to earth and friends with the rest of us. The more I think of them, the more I sympathise with McAllister, I could just kic.....arghh. One must learn to be diplomatic.",970790400,6,3867,5.225806451612903

Meet Jim MacCalister (Matthew Broderick - miscast  again), Tracy's teacher, and a very popular one, who tries to push Tracy  out of the election by adding good-hearted jock and popular student Paul  Metzler (Chris Klein - excellent actor!).

After the bomb of a few years ago, Election made up for every bit of it and reminded me of why  Broderick is so great.  This is his best since Ferris Bueller.
The movie  is about the life of Broderick and his obsession with overachiever Tracy  Flick (Witherspoon).  Two two have a love/hatred relationship going and it  plays out amazingly well.
This is another one of those movies that  doesn't get the due it deserves and instead, movies like American Pie which  appeal to a wider, yet dumber, audience.

It's more of a  ""Drop Jaw"" kind of thing, although there are plenty of said belly  laughs within. Reese witherspoon is so good that she could have easily  pulled this off alone. Lucky for us, the entire cast seems as equally  gifted under the confident hands of Payne. There is so much bright dialog  (Payne also did the screenplay from the novel) and kooky editing that I  will have to see this more than twice just to absorb it all. Matthew  Broderick has perfected another complex character, and this is easily one  of his most adorable roles. I don't generally relish comedies with so many  morose overtones (loneliness, impotance, infidelity and greed to name just  a few), but this film is executed so skillfully that everything works  perfectly.

I wanted to see it when it came out in theatres last year.  I was going to go with my friend, but he was ditching school and I had too much stuff to do (or so I  thought).  He saw it and said it was great, one of the best movies he's  seen all year (and he's the toughest movie critic that I know).
So  finally I saw it and loved it.  Reese Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick,  is great.  I was so surprised to see Witherspoon play such a dislikeable  character, especially after the virgin in Cruel Intentions and her role in  Man in the Moon (not the Jim Carrey movie; a movie from the early nineties  that is GREAT too).  But she was terrific; Tracy Flick reminded me so much  of this ""perfect"" student that went to high school with me.
I  suggested this movie to all of my friends, and one of my friends hated the  movie.  Its not the stereotypical comedy; you laugh because you hope that  this is only a movie and that politics really doesn't work like this in  real life.

One of the best of '99, but  did we really need the subplot of Broderick's trashy lifestyle? Maybe the  film tried to make it's characters easy to hate.

Some of the  negative reviews center around it not being 'funny', characters are weak,  and there's no plot.  To me, it's because I don't think the film is meant  to be a 'laugh-a-minute' comedy, but more of a satire about what's going on  in the political world.  Watch the film again and see that the 3 candidates  are meant to represent the types of politicians out there.  You can connect  the rest of the casts with the other components of the political system.

Particulary effective are the shots where the action is  frozen during a commentary.  What I found annoying was the directors  commentary, during which we are told about loads of deleted scenes which  are great, without any real explanation as to why they were deleted.

Let me explain. Reese Witherspoon is well, let's just say, Marcia Brady on  Ritalin. It's an episode about an election. If Tracy (aka Marcia) doesn't  win, gosh, we just don't know what she'll do.
The election is between  Tracy, the opportunistic brain, and a dumb, naive, popular, but really  sweet jock (not your stereotypical bully type, like, say Jay Mohr in high  school or anything). Then there's the third candidate, but I won't give  that away.
Will the brain beat the brawn? Hmm.
So that's the surface  layer. Definitely Brady Bunch material, right? But add Matthew Broderick as  the ""protagonist"", a teacher who's sleazy, jealous and spiteful.  Throw in a killer bee, a jezebel neighbor, and a jilted teenage lesbian.  Also add real human emotions, not caricatures, where the viewer at times  can't say ""he's bad"" or ""she's good"". They're all  human. Some are just more inhumane.
The movie explores motivation,  winning, the political process, and human tragedy. But boy is it funny! See  it, I mean it. It was perhaps my favorite of 1999.",953251200,29,1179,4.83
1057084,5,6305574944,"With a cast of teen favorites that includes Reese Witherspoon and 80's icon Matthew Broderick, you might expect Election to be nothing more than another shallow teen drama about kids worrying what they're going to wear  or who they're taking to prom.

Young  audiences hungry for recycled storylines and cardboard characters can look  to the latest from Jennifer Love Hewitt because this will likely go over  they're heads.  Shedding his Ferris Bueller image, Broderick plays Mr. M  (every high school has one) - the popular teacher who challenges his  students.  But one student gets under his skin.  Tracy Flick (Witherspoon)  is an overachieving go-getter steaming rolling her way towards the class  presidency until Mr. M enlists the high school quarterback (Chris Klein in  a sure star-making performace) to run against her.  His resentment is  brought on by an affair Tracy had with his friend and collegue which  inevitably to him being fired.  Alexander Payne brings his comedic flare to  the sophisticated novel by Tom Perrotta (which I also highly recommend).

Reese Witherspoon plays Tracy Flick, an over-ambitous student with desires to be  elcted to her student council. Tracy Flick is the kind of person I think  we've all met before. Driven, ambitious, very bright, but at the same time  she really has no discernable personality. The fact that she is driven and  involved in everything is what's getting her by. She has very few friends  and is, if anything, made fun of routinely.
Matthew Broderick plays her  teacher. He's a very regular man, teaching a dull course, leading a fairly  boring and repetetive life. When he finds tracy's ambitions threatning he  sets out on destroying her.
Election is far more hilarious than most  movies because of its extremely bitter nature. Many people will find the  story cold and sterile but if you get past that it is a hugely entertaining  film.
All the performances are first rate and if you compare it to the  other ""teen"" comedy of the year, ""American Pie"" it is  evident that this is light years ahead. While ""American Pie""  settles on cheap belly laughs and a feel good ending, ""Election""  opts for exactly the opposite. In fact this is really a very adult film  performed by teenagers.

Broderick is of course  excellent as the inept teacher Jim McAllister (can this really be the same  person who played Ferris Bueller?). He's such a likeable actor that its  hard to root against him, even when his character is behaving like, well, a  moron 11th-grader.
Witherspoon's Tracy Flick is truly frightening, more a  force of nature than a human being. Pretty without being attractive, smart  with no real insight, she is ambition personified, and since probably  everyone went to school with someone like Tracy (hopefully in reduced  strength) its not hard to see why a teacher might want to cut her down to  size. There is a current of sexual tension that runs between Tracy and  McAllister that really isn't followed up on, which I thought would have  greatly improved the movie.
And when Witherspoon and Broderick aren't on  screen, which is too often, the movie loses steam. Not that the rest of the  cast stinks or that their characters don't deliver some laughs, but they  interrupt the central conflict of the story.
The ending of the movie is  all wrong, a series of voice-overs by Broderick and the other characters  about what happened to him after the election the movie centers around. It  was OK, but it certainly wasn't funny, and it wasn't satisfying. And that I  guess was my overall impression of the film-- OK, but not really  satisfying.",951523200,8,1632,4.760714285714286

(Just like the candy).",943401600,,627,4.412280701754386
1057230,5,6305574944,"No joke, this has to be one of the best political satires I've ever seen.  Not in the least because it takes place almost entirely in high school.  Don't be fooled, it's as much about basic human nature as any  oscar-nominated film in the last few years.  It's brilliant, it's complex,  and at the end, it's paints a really subversively dark picture of american  life.  And it's hilarious - the last line had me cracking up in the aisle  of the theater.  Can't wait til the price comes down.",943401600,,491,4.426966292134831
1057231,1,6305574944,"I could kick myself for shelling out the one day rental fee for this. Even if it were free, I'd pass on this one. Reese Witherspoon should have 1) hightailed it out of town when she had the chance and 2) should have  thought about throwing herself in the dumpster with her characters posters.  The trailer itself rates 4 stars-watch that and enjoy this movie.",941846400,,359,4.507692307692308
1057232,5,6305574944,This was a very good movie. I especially liked the parts where Reese went ballistic when she sees something happening to her campaign!,941846400,,134,4.869565217391305
1057297,5,6305574944,"This movie requires multiple viewings to get most of the jokes. After I first saw it, I knew I liked it and knew that I needed to see it again. It proved much better the 2nd viewing because I listened and watched with more  attention. I was laughing at the jokes while other people just sat there. I  loved how it reminded me of my highschool...a windowless prison. The DVD is  good. The commentary by Alexander Payne is well done.",941500800,,431,4.3625
1057298,5,6305574944,"It seems like someone besides the class clown or a FBLA geek has made a movie about high school. Is it possible that this film is the first since  ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" to portray a teacher as someone that isn't a  caricature or an icon of some sort? It suprises and delights with every  scene.",941414400,2,292,4.2727272727272725

1057301,5,6305574944,"Oscar is usually cool on comedies, but this films deserves (at least) Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Actress awards.  Word of mouth is doing for this brilliant masterpiece what the promoters did not even attempt to  do.  Probably because the film was considered too smart, too real to become  anything but a cult favorite.  Not so!  It has something for everyone.  Penetrating, perceptive, sexy, timely, and at the same time hysterically  funny.",940723200,,453,5.109589041095891

1057303,5,6305574944,"Forget those bloated atrocities ""American Beauty"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" -- this movie was brainier and ballsier than either. ""Election"" cuts into American life with the kind of wit and  accuracy of Preston Sturges and Elaine May. I know of no higher praise.",940377600,,256,4.953488372093023
7892360,5,6305574944,"A surprisingly dark little comedy with sparkling performances.  Adult themes come disturbingly close to real life, couched in glib dialogue and a  squeaky clean suburban high school for a backdrop.  Same genre as Ridgemont High et al., but less compromising with the realities and foibles of human nature.  Reese Witherspoon brims with talent as the narcissistic world beater in training.  And fair warning: she does get wet.",1526169600,,425,5.2835820895522385
