The case for greed is the platform at hand as always, the almighty dollar.  The problem comes down to demand.  If we as stewards of the earth stop buying the products, i.e. bottled water, the demand would dwindle and the lack of attractiveness of the industry's drain on the earth's water would help preserve this natural resouce for generations to come.

Corporations = BAD
Profit = BAD
Consumer Groups = GOOD!
Solutions = ??? Uh, hmmm, D' OH!!

In the realm of solutions is where FLOW stops flowing quite as well, in my mind.  No coherent alternative is offered other than getting local groups to stop Nestle, stop Vivendi, stop Suez, etc.

FLOW is better on the attack than it is in creating proposed solutions.  If its viewing helps galvanize public support for reaching sane solutions, it will have achieved its aim.",1230854400,4,717,5.076923076923077

3557340,5,B001EUSYHQ,"It's not very often that tears start rolling down my cheeks while watching a political documentary! Flow was that moving! A film full of both the very best and the very worst humanity has to offer.

I'm an environmental activist and have been following global water issues for years. What makes Flow so absolutely wonderful is that it covers it all. It's like watching a prosecutor make an indictment: needless water contamination by some rather nasty chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals; harm caused by World Bank & IMF policies; gross abuses of human rights by smug transnational water corporations throughout the world, including the USA; harm caused by damming many of the world's largest rivers; preventable diseases and deaths caused by polluted water, such a cholera; hormonal changes in fish and amphibians.

On the other hand you see some incredibly brave people stand up to these mind-boggling abuses of power. Even an extremely elderly disciple of Mahatma Gandhi teaches the next generation of activists how to be effective. Plenty of brilliant and appropriate, low-technology solutions are shown. It does not take huge transnational corporations to assure the delivery of safe drinking water, which is (pardon the pun) made crystal clear!

Flow is one of the most outstanding documentaries I have had the privilege to watch in my entire life! My hat's off to all those who made this magnificent film possible!

If you live in a third world country like India or Bolivia, under the Washington consensus the rich countries will get a contract to supply your water, but they will charge you more than you can afford.

3557349,4,B001EUSYHQ,"Having water to drink is a serious business. You can't survive without it and you get very sick if it is contaminated. Ask me! I know. I got very sick when living in Africa. Drinking bad water can and does kill you. I survived. Many others don't.

In America we take clean water for granted. In other countries you might have to walk miles to get your daily water.

It is very scary to think that the world might run out of fresh drinking water. Is bottled water any safer you might ask? According to this documentary much bottled water is just tap water. And we know what tap water contains. So how can we stay healthy?

To be honest watching this documentary was a very emotional experience which almost brought me to tears. My heart really cried out for our needy world. The poor are really suffering and need out help to provide them with clean water. Fortunately there is hope and many charities are making a real difference in the lives of ordinary humans who need the basics for survival.

In the end this documentary basically asks one question. ""Is Access to Clean Drinking Water a Human Right?"" I am very convinced that it is. Even so we pay for water in all forms. We can't take care of our lawn unless we pay a yearly fee for water. We can't get water out of our tap unless we pay a monthly fee. You may be asking another question: ""Why should some people get free water when the rest must pay?""

These are all difficult questions and the solutions to world problems may take many more years to work out. I have never thought so deeply about water in my life so this whole documentary was a revelation to me.

For those of us who can we should continue to support charities that help people have access to clean water. That is the least we can do. If we show compassion and love that is what will change the world. What I'd like to see is rich people giving more money so poor people can have good water. Why should the rich take more money from the poor? And what happens to those who can't afford to buy water. Do they just die?

Will I stop buying bottled water? Probably not but I will make better choices as to which water I buy.

 Profits in the west is all cool for me, but when we're talking about nations where the average annual wage can be 3/4 thousand dollars per/year, and that's the workers, many don't have jobs in the first place, the price of the water is often out of most people's reach.
Water rights is the big thing these days. I live in Chile and it's illegal to dig a hole and use any water you find, it all belongs to someone. I understand living in a house,flat in the big city and paying for water but in the middle of the country digging a hole and using the water? Most people who live in the country earn low salaries.

3557352,5,B001EUSYHQ,"This was awesome! If more people are informed of what is going on with water, then maybe it will move enough people to make change.

It is sad what the big corporation do for money.... Water is a natural resource so why are water companies going into communities acting as if they are going to make things better for them only to turn their worlds upside down and create straight chaos for their communities.

But why would the corporation do this?

MONEY and CONTROL... its not good for people to be in control of themselves... they may realize their strengths and become too powerful. This is the only reason to me why corporations and governments want to control communities oh and let me not leave out home owner associations...

What are your interest?

If you want knowledge about water and how nestle, pepsi, coca cola etc steals water and then resales water to people who love bottled water, then this will inform you and make you want to do something about this.

It is really sad how this has happened over the years, and just because people don't realize what is going on at the time that these water companies come into their communities.. many think the companies come to better their water issues, but they really come to make profit.. to take away.. And from the looks of the CEO's of the water companies on Flow, they looked as if they had no concern for the people who's land they intruded on.

I will continue to share this information with family and friends. People need to know what is going on and what is to come.

Other Issues mentioned:

I had no idea that Dams also moved people out of their homes and way of life just so a dam could be built, and then never supply the water to the communities that it promised to supply.  It broke my heart to learn that dams were built in communities that were vibrant and full of life only to make them relocate to areas where they could not even make food for themselves, their whole way of life changed.

Other things you will learn:

You will learn the names of major water companies, how nestle, Pepsi, and co cola go world wide for water just to drain communities of their natural resources, bottle it and sale it.  You will see how people are fighting around the world to drive these companies out of their communities.

Next on our list to watch:

Next we will watch Blue Gold and we can not wait to further educate our selves on this matter.

Well back to Flow, and then King Corn...

3557355,5,B001EUSYHQ,"Excellent video!  Well worth the time to watch!  Have a screening & invite friends, family & neighbors.

This is a scary story of what is happening now, in that the world's water corporations are taking over the supplies of potable water (streams, wells, etc.), bottling the water & pumping the ground aquifers & rivers dry...

They come to a community purporting to ""help the people by providing clean drinking water to everyone.""  What they don't mention is that ""everyone"" to them means ""everyone able to PAY for it.""

I worked in the 1980s in Cochabamba, Bolivia, near the Peruvian border.  There, we piped water into the villages via a central pump station.  This freed the local children up from the chore of hauling water for the house & family so that they had time to attend the school we built.

Everything we accomplished in the 1980s has now been destroyed by Suez Corporation.  Suez (major water corporation) has come in, established a humongous multi-million dollar facility, and provided outlets for the water.  The caveat being that this water costs over 10 times what it did before.  Most of the local peasants have no way to afford to purchase this water.  Unfortunately, Suez has been so effective in polluting the naturally clean springs & rivers from which the natives traditionally drew their water.  Suez was even instrumental in diverting slaughterhouse offal into the local river which runs through Cochabamba - to the point that the river runs red, stinks with filth, & must now be enclosed & covered to prevent further disease.  In other words, the locals must buy their water from Suez or do without.

Enter Evo Morales, President of Bolivia.  He has turned Suez, the WorldBank & IMF out of Bolivia & has reclaimed the water for the people.  Because of his stand to keep foreign corporations from preying & profiting on the backs of the Bolivian peasants, he is now vilified & demonized on par with Hugo Chavez.

For an even better perspective on how US ""Aid"", WorldBank, & IMF have been supporting corporate looting of developing countries, buy ""South of the Border"" by Oliver Stone!  It is an excellent follow-up to this film, in that it explains how conditions in Latin American countries have improved since ridding themselves of the American-sponsored ""Aid"" organizations...

I think a documentary like this should include at least 50% dedicated towards discussing alternatives and solutions. Instead, the viewer is left depressed and hopeless around this issue - so why would anyone want to be involved in finding creative solutions? Therefore, I think they're doing a disservice to the issue.",1285977600,3,582,5.126315789473685
3557358,4,B001EUSYHQ,"The 2008 documentary FLOW: HOW DID A HANDFUL OF CORPORATIONS STEAL OUR WATER? answers what its title asks.  The moneyed interests and corrupt government officials - the usual suspects - are responsible.  Just as European powers held the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference to literally divide Africa for conquest, today corporations work to take not land but water, worldwide.

FLOW makes me think of Europe's pillage of Africa because of its depiction of European utility companies such as Veolia and Suez, which operate municipal water systems on a for-profit system but deny it to millions of third-world people who can't afford their fees. As the film explains, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank strong-arm poor nations into turning over public waterworks to those companies.

Meanwhile in the United States, FLOW reminds us that the modern way to wealth remains stealing.  Corporations such as Nestle and Coca-Cola deplete public water by bottling and selling it for profit.  Do they have the right to take from the commons and sell it back?  As FLOW's credits roll, the answers are still in the courts.  Private water companies target American communities, too, wishing to be the unnecessary middle man between our water and us.

As FLOW leaves it, the final answer will come from the public.  According to the documentary, California will run out of potable water in 20-odd years and New Mexico in ten, to name two states where private industry finds H2O good to the last drop.  FLOW names a number of organizations fighting both the depletion and privatization of the public's water; a web search of the film's title will take you to the same information.

3557359,5,B001EUSYHQ,"Just watched this compelling film about the scarcity of clean water on the planet.  Filmmaker Irena Salina, inspired by an article in The Nation called ""Who Owns Water"", sounds the alarms, exposing how huge corporations are ""privatizing"" the world's fresh water supply.  Often this comes at the expense of the people upon whose land this water freely flows -- people are displaced from their homes and farms with promises of new homes and clean water systems which are never delivered, while the corporations pollute the environment and destroy the ecosystem.  In some cases, the corporations leave inadequate water for the people whose land they have overtaken or offer to sell back that water at prices the poorest communities simply cannot afford.

Water is necessary for life, yet unclean water carries diseases that kill more people each year than AIDS or war.  Human beings cannot survive even more than a few days without clean water to drink, but when water is privatized and then only offered for sale to people who have no means to pay the inflated price, the only option is to drink what dirty water can be found.  And, lest we think clean water is only a problem in the world's poorest countries, the film points out that the water system in the United States is contaminated by pollutants including toxic waste, pesticides (that are illegal in other civilized countries) and pharmaceuticals we see advertised on TV every day.

While the information is alarming (the water supply is running out in as little as five years for some parts of the country, bottled water is no safer than tap, and there is barely one person at the EPA overseeing the safety of our drinking water) and the corporate greed that threatens to control our access to clean water is frightening -- there is some hope:  the films shows examples of ordinary people who organize protests and sometimes emerge victorious in their fight for free access to water.

In 1948, the United Nations created a ""Universal Declaration of Human Rights"", which has 30 articles of agreement.  On the 60th anniversary of this historic achievement, the filmmakers spoke at the U.N., proposing the addition of Article 31 which states, ""Everyone has the right to clean and accessible water, adequate for the health and well-being of the individual and family, and no one shall be deprived of such access or quality of water due to individual economic circumstance.""

3557363,3,B001EUSYHQ,"The film is effectively made, but somewhat lame. One reviewer accurately characterized this film as portraying engaged citizens opposing predatory corporations. While the corporations involved certainly have their own self-interest at heart, the issues might not be too different if a socialist government that sincerely held the interests of its citizens at heart were involved. Burgeoning populations worldwide have slowly been exhausting the supply of easily-available fresh water. When the world's human population was much smaller, people could waste water without causing severe environmental degradation. However, too many people consuming water directly from lakes and rivers have created a situation where between a quarter and a third of the world's human population no longer has access to clean water. Modern plumbing can use water more efficiently, but building and maintaining this infrastructure is costly. Many of the world's poorer people are unable to afford water distributed through modern plumbing, whether companies or governments install it. This is a real dilemma, but depicting the problem as simply one of corporate greed is clearly a red herring. The film does explore solutions that avoid expensive infrastructure, but none that can be implemented on a large scale. If you can see between the lines, this film can be thought-provoking and worthwhile. Unfortunately, too many of the lame left will simply use this film to find yet another excuse to bray against the power instead of analyzing the problem to find a constructive solution.",1259366400,6,1564,5.520833333333333

Sadly, this precious resource is becoming more rare, if not, close to extinction (yes!) in some parts of the world, creating a modern ""trail of tears,""  an exodus of environmental refugees, and ultimately deaths.  Unfortunate also is the fact that many policy makers are ""commodifying"" this basic human need to quench one's thirst, that is, selling it to the highest bidder.  This film cogently portrays the extent and seriousness of this problem and argues, with convincing examples, for global cooperation to adequately replenish and equitably distribute this essential life force.  Its conclusion that there ought to be an additional article to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a document increasingly referred to as customary international law which all nations must abide, that guarantees clean water as a human right is especially convincing.

3557365,5,B001EUSYHQ,"Of the films I've seen and books I've read about current topics, this is the first that I genuinely feel compelled to recommend that everyone should get.  It's not possible to understate the significance of the subject - access to decent water - or to overstate the growing threat from the giant water congromerates.  The film focuses on three corporations primarily - Thames Water, Vivendi, and Suez.  Suez, the French company, has been around for 150 years, so it's gotten quite a good start. Almost no one in the US has ever heard of these companies because they operate mostly in the ""third world"" and in growing markets like India.  The film traces their path across the world; and shows the devastation left in their wake. However, the film also showcases the few instances where the people of a region have been successful in taking back their water, or at least holding off the companies' attempts to corner the market.  The culprit is generally the same throughout the third world: the World Bank, which keeps lending money to impoverished areas then demands, as payback, the privitization of public utilities - electricity and water - which results in massive increases in the cost of these utilities.  And, of course, the biggest ally privitization has is corrupt governments.  The single most compelling piece of the entire film is about a community in India, in an essentially barren region, which built - literally stone by stone - a system of canals to catch and hold what little rain there was.  This community created a lush, self-sustaining eco-system which brings in extra cash by permitting it to sell the excess crops.  Now, facing the central Indian government's new mandates to make water a for-profit resource, it may become illegal for this community to keep the water it collects.  Then, just when you might think this is all other people's problems, the film focuses on a water bottling plant in upstate Michigan which extracts the clean water, replaces it with polluted water, and gets a 90-year tax break to do so.  The citizens are fighting the plant; they won the first round in court; but so far the appeals courts are siding with the plant against the community.  Nor is this Michigan plant the only one in the US.  The problem, like anything left unchecked, is growing exponentially.",1258588800,2,2317,4.865139949109415

If you have any interest in your health, the health of your children and of our global civilization - then you should borrow FLOW from your local library or purchase it through AMAZON. In the film FLOW you will learn how over 30,000 people die each day from water-related diseases, and how contaminated water is one of the greatest killers of people in history. You will learn how birth defects and other health problems are substantially higher in areas located near large agricultural zones.

Flow will also bring you up-to-date on what is inside the bottled water you drink, how you can save money and by drinking tap water, and how the some water bottlers are taking control of water sources while destroying ecosystems. The film informs us about how over 30,000 people die each day from water-related diseases. In the film we learn how birth defects and other health problems are substantially higher in areas located near large agricultural zones.

In the film FLOW you will learn how control of water translates into power through economic control of money, how control of water translates into the power to control people in small communities, major cities and even entire countries - and, how control of water translated into  ultimate power over life and death - which flows into which areas of the world will have healthy and wealthy people with long life spans - and which areas will have poverty and unhealthy people with short life spans. In other words, a subtle form of planned genocide.

In the film FLOW you will find answers - as to how to create and manage low-tech water management for your home and your community. Why you should stop using bottled water. And, learn how you can help the world's water through some simple changes in your personal behavior, through changes in the way you spend your money and your time.

In the film FLOW you will learn how the answer to the world's water crisis does not exist with our governments, or with our transnational corporations - no - the answer to the world's water crisis exists in the hearts and minds of people who work together in a concerted effort with an all-embracing water philosophy.",1256083200,14,3807,6.8391752577319584

Somewhere below is a derisive, one star review of this remarkable film by one K. Davis.  He strongly prefers ""Blue Gold"", another film on the same subject, to Flow.  Fine. That is certainly his prerogative.  I'm sure Blue Gold is an excellent film, however I can only pity the bleak lack of perception in which Mr or Ms Davis is completely enclosed.  One thing is certain:  K Davis could not possibly be a film maker.

3557369,2,B001EUSYHQ,"So I bought this DVD because it is about quite possibly one of the biggest problems our generation faces today. The problem of water. I LOVE THE Indian philosophy of water ownership, the statistics on how quickly we are running out, and the presentation of the problem in this film is laid out very nicely. However this film pushes the total WRONG AGENDA. Its force feeding the viewer that the UN is a viable solution, while in reality the UN is filled with the worst criminals the world has ever seen.

If we are going to solve these problems we need a major social change throughout the world. I see it already beginning. Its the consciousness of people everywhere that needs to change. And lucky for us it is!

This film is trying to convince the watcher that the UN is actually a solution. THE UN IS THE BIGGEST PART OF THE PROBLEM. The sooner people start to WAKE UP to the fact that these politicians in office right now are the causation the better off we will be. GET US OUT OF THE UN, and turn the water back to the people where it belongs. No one owns the water that falls from the sky. You own it, I own, everyone owns. Don't give it to the freaking United Nations!!!

Anyways its definitely worth watching. I gave it two stars because I feel it pushes an agenda instead of simply providing information like it should. If they cut that out it would be 4 or 5 stars for sure.",1245888000,7,1385,4.319230769230769
3557370,5,B001EUSYHQ,"The documentary Flow: For Love of Water, an official selection of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, is well worth your time.  The overall question this film poses to the viewer is should water be a natural resource that is allowed to be privatized.  So the clash between public and private interests is at the heart of this film.  The film makes the thesis that a developing ""water cartel"" is in the making that could have a disastrous impact on the worlds poor, the ecosystem, and local communities.  There are several angles about water politics that the film explores in terms of different parts of the world, such as India, South Africa and a Mecosta County, a small county in northern Michigan that is trying to fight Nestle Corporation over a water bottling plant.  This is also a story about grassroots organizing and the legal system.

This film would be excellent for an economics class at the college and high school level, as well any government course or current events class.  U.S. History courses could adapt this film if they teach about the environmental movements in U.S. History as well as the role of government in people's lives.  The film asks the viewer to consider: ""is water and access to it a fundamental human right?""

 The only disappointing thing for me was that the nice packaging the DVD came in, which is non-plastic, did not have a booklet with it, which would have made this film's message and places to contact for more information more accessible to people.  An area the film does not deal with in detail is the massive demand for products that need water as an ingredient, such as soft drinks, juices, and beer to name a few.  While Coca Cola is mentioned briefly, bottled water companies, such as Nestle, seem to be at the heart of the film makers concern.  There is much food for thought in this film.",1245456000,4,1838,4.670807453416149

Real eye opening - we all intend to keep a much closer eye on what's happening with drinking water in our community.

3557374,4,B001EUSYHQ,"This film might almost be viewed as a companion piece to Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth."" It's a documentary dealing with the global dwindling of our potable water supply.

The opening of the film presents a telling metaphor. It likens our rivers and streams to the veins and arteries of a living organism. The oceans are the heart, the source that replenishes and pumps the water back into circulation through this system. ""Flow"" focuses on the evils its producers see stemming from the current worldwide pressure being applied by the World Bank and by big business to privatize this vast organic system. They show how privatizing water supplies and then charging poor rural villagers for the flow they once brought up free from wells - puts water beyond their means and further endangers and impoverishes them.

This is a somewhat one-sided view, and many people might find a number of points they could argue with in this presentation. For example, it's not always clear how government ownership of water sources would lead to freer, cleaner water for the needy. Another example - the film producers lament the damming of the Ganges, and imply that the Ganges was a sacred, pure, free-flowing river before these business usurpations took place. I'm not sure that was exactly the case.

Then too, sometimes the citations of the damages that have followed in the wake of business take-overs are a little vague. The film's narrator mentions all the birth defects that have occurred in a village after a business has moved into the area and used local water sources either as a dumping grounds or else preemptively as a water supply. However when the narrator is shown going into such villages, it seems she sometimes has to lead the villagers to complain about these specific results. In responses to questions about increases in birth defects, villagers only mention how they have felt ""itchy"" since the arrival of the big businesses.

Then like ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" this film ends with what some might consider a slightly overwrought Armageddon scenario in which it is predicted that the desperate need for water will lead to global acts of terrorism in the near future.

However, it would be hard to argue with the film's basic premise that water, our life source, is becoming a commercialized, scarce, and increasingly endangered substance. In the process, ""Flow"" gives viewers rare glimpses into places around the world - into South African, Indian, and New Zealand villages, where the control of water supplies is being taken out of the hands of indigenous peoples and is being put into the hands of businesses that meter it as a commodity. All this is beautifully, poetically, and in most cases, convincingly photographed.

There are also many interesting extras on this DVD, including two 1950's schoolroom films telling how water gets pumped from its source into the homes of everyday urban users.

If you would like to pursue this subject further, I suggest you check out:

""H2O and the Waters of Forgetfulness,"" by Ivan Illich - a profound philosophical essay put into book form, elucidating how a substance once rich in myriad individual local meanings is being commodified into world-wide uniformity.

""Bottlemania"" by Elizabeth Royte - a book that traces how advertising hype convinced so many urbanites that they HAD to have eight commercially bottled servings of water a day, and that takes readers on a tour of some of the industrial operations now supplying that manufactured need.

""Progress and Poverty"" by Henry George - a book making a somewhat antique, but still very cogent argument that land and all its resources (including ore and water) should be community property, forever off-limits to private speculation. George provides a lot of instruction in basic economics along the way.

""The Economy of Cities"" by Jane Jacobs - a book that brilliantly demonstrates how rural indigenous cultures can be empowered, not by having massive World Bank/industrial projects transplanted into their midst - but by having intricate, vital, diverse URBAN economies fostered in their nations.",1239148800,2,4109,5.090638930163447
3557375,5,B001EUSYHQ,"Flow - For Love of Water is a documentary about the theft of water by private companies. This movie should be watched by everybody since it concerns everybody. It is also a great reference resource for any student writing a paper on Environmental Issues.

Bottled water companies spend tens of millions of dollars trying to convince the public that bottled water is safer than tap water. The documentary points out that this is untrue since

1) There is only 1 inspector in the whole of the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. monitoring ALL the bottled water sold here. So, in reality the public really doesn't know if there are any contaminants present in their bottled water and what they might be.

2) If there are any contaminants in tap water, they may also enter the body through the skin during showering or bathing. Therefore, drinking bottled water isn't going to protect you.

The multinational bottled water companies are also going into towns stealing the local people's fresh water by pumping it out of the ground mercilessly with no regard for possible harm being done to that environment. After they've finished taking the fresh water, they leave behind muddy sinkholes in the ground.

The film also follows the struggles in the third world against water companies from industrialized nations that try to take over water plants and distribution with the goal of charging even the poorest of the poor money for simple drinking water.

The film isn't all doom and gloom though. It chronicles the victory of the people of Bolivia who, under the pressure of the World Bank, had been forced to hand over the control of their water filtration plants to some European private water companies. However, through a determined and concerted effort, the common people there protested against this injustice and won back control of their water. A lesson to be learned here for the rest of us.

So, please get this dvd and see the story of the battle for what's being now called ""Blue Gold"" (Water)

3557377,4,B001EUSYHQ,"There have been a series of recent books on the issue of water, including one by Barlow that was the basis for this film, and an annual report on water that is discouraging, to put it mildly.  This is an excellent overview of the problem of water and may reach people who aren't inclined to pick up a book and read.  Ultimately the problem is that the earth has a fixed amount of water and a rapidly growing population, a population that will soon require more water than is available.  The subtitle refers to a troubling dimension of the problem, the privatization of water, but that is not the only problem.  I applaud the film makers but am probably more pessimistic than they.  It seems to me there is only one ultimate (and unthinkable) solution to the problem and that is the massive die-off of a substantial proportion of the human race.  Yes, 10-20 thousand children die each day from contaminated water, but the reality is that if they were saved the population would grow even more rapidly and the speed with which the problem becomes a global crisis will accelerate.  (No, I'm not justifying their deaths or giving my approval, but I don't see desalination and improved water purification systems as anything more than short-term solutions -- sorry, it's just the pessimist in me.)  The film is also a reminder that we spend too much time worrying about oil and not enough time worrying about water.  People can live without oil (though perhaps not as comfortably as they'd like) but no one can live without water.  If countries are willing to go to war for oil one can only imagine what they would be willing to do for water. (Given that access to water has often been a trigger for war I suppose we really don't have to use our imaginations).  The US is second in the world for the amount of drinkable water per person and that makes it easy for us to be complacent, but problems are already surfacing in the South and West and things will only get worse.  I don't have an answer (other than the unthinkable) but I would hope that films such as this would prompt our leaders to focus more attention on the issue.",1235260800,,2125,4.534031413612565

I'm an environmental activist and have been following global water issues for years. What makes Flow so absolutely wonderful is that it covers it all. It's like watching a prosecutor make an indictment: needless water contamination by some rather nasty chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides and pharmaceuticals; harm caused by World Bank & IMF policies; gross abuses of human rights by smug transnational water corporations throughout the world, including the USA; harm caused by damming many of the world's largest rivers; preventable diseases and deaths caused by polluted water, such a cholera; hormonal changes in fish and amphibians.

On the other hand you see some incredibly brave people stand up to these mind-boggling abuses of power. Even an extremely elderly disciple of Mahatma Gandhi teaches the next generation of activists how to be effective. Plenty of brilliant and appropriate, low-technology solutions are shown. It does not take huge transnational corporations to assure the delivery of safe drinking water, which is (pardon the pun) made crystal clear!

Flow is one of the most outstanding documentaries I have had the privilege to watch in my entire life! My hat's off to all those who made this magnificent film possible!
