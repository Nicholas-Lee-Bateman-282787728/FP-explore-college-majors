 ""BRAVO ZULU"", TO ALL THE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKED SO TIRELESSLY TO SAVE HER AS A  PART OF AMERICA'S LIVING HISTORY AND TO THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO KEEP HER MEMORIES ALIVE ON A DAILY BASIS, FOR ALL AMERICANS. SHE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF AMERICA'S TWENTIETH CENTURY AND REMAINS AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL PART OF AMERICA'S TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY! SHE WAS NOT SCRAPPED OR MET AN IGNOMINIOUS END LIKE THE U.S.S. ORISKANY, (NOW A FISH SANCTUARY ).THE U.S.S. MIDWAY ALONG WITH OTHER GREAT UNITED STATES NAVAL WARSHIPS AND THEIR INTREPID CREWS, HELPED TO PRESERVE OUR PRICELESS FREEDOMS.

2559200,5,B000FBFYYQ,"I was fortunate enough to have seen this documentary on tv some time ago & promised myself that I would purchase this DVD. I spent four years on her flight deck & sent out sorties during the Laotian crisis in 1961. Again in 1962 & 63 we plied the Gulf of Tonkin, once again sending out our sorties against the Viet Cong. A progression of jerseys from ""blue to red, then Yellow"" were my uniform.
  This DVD is authentic & anyone who would purchase it is in for an honest view of life on a carrier & more explicitly, my home . We affectionately referred to her as ""The Gray Lady"". You will understand, after you've viewed this DVD.",1395100800,,629,4.277310924369748

Plenty of information about the history of this great ship. Good video coverage of flight deck ops and the ship underway. Would have been nice to see more interior shots, but I am sure those are hard to come across. All told, makes me want to get out to San Diego all the more to see the ship.",1368489600,7,459,4.168539325842697
