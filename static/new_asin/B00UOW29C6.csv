7066365,2,B00UOW29C6,"The film does stress God and faith, and it has a happy ending, which was good.
Unfortunately it is really slow moving.  I had to fast forward it a few times because the action was so slow.  Also the plot is not very interesting.
I can't recommend this movie.",1460419200,,258,4.244897959183674

7066369,5,B00UOW29C6,Angel House and ABox Of Faith were excellent movies! but sad to say Christmas Angel is one I will Not BE able to view! the Dvd was blankI went to play it and there was nothing there. needless to say I was rather sad to receive a disc that did not work on my pc dvd player,1447286400,2,271,3.7719298245614037
7066370,5,B00UOW29C6,"I have been on a CHRISTIAN MOVIE phase for over a year now.  There are some excellent movies out there which are Christian.  This is one.  A wonderful story, well acted, well written.  Worth a watch!",1442188800,29,199,4.444444444444445
7066371,5,B00UOW29C6,"It started a bit slow, but picked up. The girl who plays Dior is a great actress! Hope to see her in more Christian films!! Movie was worth buying! Shows you how to be patient, believe, wait on God & keep FAITH no matter the pitfalls in life! Good movie for someone unsaved, is subtle. Good for Tweens & Teens too!",1442102400,18,314,4.163934426229508
7066372,1,B00UOW29C6,"I really wanted to like this. But I hated the acting and the storyline.
Although I know it was trying to say ""trust God, even if it means doing the unconventional"". However, I would hate for a child to watch this and believe it's ok to live on their own if their parents were in trouble. Or to not ask for or receive help when needed. I would not recommend this for children, especially impressionable teenagers.",1529971200,,412,4.434210526315789
7066373,5,B00UOW29C6,"Really enjoyed this gentle movie with so much feel good.  Kudos to the writer/directors that showed this young, very intelligent mature woman respectful of both her parents.  Watch Disney movies and you will see the young girl making her father look like a fool because she is so much smarter than he is and of course she is always right and he is wrong. The girls in Disney movies are daring and brave and go against their fathers  direction to end up being the hero.  In this movie the father was a kind loving man and his daughter appreciated him.  She gave him credit for teaching her how to be wise.  She never wavered in her belief of him but went on with life as she had to due to her circumstances.  In the end her right attitude paid off.  Thank you for portraying men/the father in such a positive light",1529884800,,813,4.337748344370861
7066374,3,B00UOW29C6,"Just a bit too unrealistic for me.  No social worker has that much free time in a work day to sit and hunt one girl when they have a full caseload and no time to do it all.  The notes on the ceiling that disappear are a simplistic way of looking at answers to prayer. The lunchbox would be the worst place for any criminal to put something they wanted to steal, and the guy would have had to be a moron to put it there, so that was also too unbelievable of a plot 'twist'.  Could have been much better with a more well written script and actors that showed more depth.  I love a good faith movie, but this was not well acted or believable.  It was just ok, not great, not awful.",1529712000,,678,3.9925925925925925
7066375,5,B00UOW29C6,"A movie at heart because we can relate to this story.  Our son is in prison and when he gets out his little girl will be 16 years old.
We are raising her but, I pray we will be able to teach her how to be resourceful and be a servant to God as this movie shows.
Not all case workers have a heart for kids and does the right thing to help the older kids out there.  We are adopting our grand
daughter so she will never have to be in the system.  May our son have a full life when he is able to get release with a wonderful

7066385,5,B00UOW29C6,I absolutely loved this movie. I know a person in my life that went through a very similar situation. This movie really moved me. I loved the key concept to the plot of the movie. If you are curious to what I am talking about? Please watch this!,1527638400,,245,4.125
7066386,5,B00UOW29C6,"How refreshing not to have sex, nudity, violence, or profanity.  This is a movie made for all ages; I'm planning to let my 13-year-old watch it.  Compared to the garbage she already is exposed to by friends with Youtube on their phones... she'll probably be shocked.

Most of the situations were believable, aside from the fact that Tim went to prison for allegedly stealing a tool.  Even with a non-violent felony on your record, the jails are just too full for petty theft to merit prison time.  Also, the social worker seemed to have no other work to do--not realistic!  They are normally overloaded with cases.

Be that as it may, this is nonetheless an uplifting, fun story, and a charming main character played well by Savanah McMahon.",1527120000,,741,4.7421875
7066387,5,B00UOW29C6,"What a great and heartwarming movie! Our entire family enjoyed this sweet movie. We have a 4, 8 and 11 year old and all said they loved it! It was completely appropriate for my 4 year old with no ""scary"" parts and nothing inappropriate for any of the kiddos. We are very picky about what we let them watch.  Great story line that even us grown ups could appreciate. It's nice to see a clean movie, that is uplifting and faith building. WATCH IT!!!",1525996800,,447,4.321428571428571

7066398,4,B00UOW29C6,"Look out. A real sweet Tear Jerker of a movie. That having been said, it is yet another 'Godly movie' (great many lately) that somehow 'steers far away' from even mentioning the Holy name of Jesus (the cross IS shown, however) - to please wider audiences I suspect. I do not like that aspect one bit.",1524700800,,300,4.375

7066400,2,B00UOW29C6,"I did not find this movie to be good at all. I expected very little...and was disappointed. I gave it 2 stars because i think the lead actress has potential...otherwise i would-be given it One.
There was no drama or tension....i am shocked by the high ratings....
I don't know what the budget was....but, Flywheel was a low budget movie....and i enjoyed that...even bought it.
I would not spend money on this movie.",1524009600,,415,4.698630136986301
7066401,1,B00UOW29C6,"Just horrid.
I watched in on a dare with a friend.
It wasn't even so bad it was good.

7066403,3,B00UOW29C6,"It's definitely for a specific type of audience. This movie is sweet. They're all so wholesome. Nothing bad happens to her while she's on the street. She's the quintessential good girl of faith. The ending was, of course, a happy ending. Everything wraps up perfectly and everyone deserving is happy.

I prefer characters with a lot more complexity and stories which aren't all happy-go-lucky, so I am certainly not the ideal target audience for this film. However, for what it is - including the mediocre, flat acting and very low budget, it's not bad. It set out to tell a story of morality, that in the end good things happen to good people, the meek shall inherit the earth, type of belief system, and it did its job.",1523404800,,721,4.6328125

7066412,5,B00UOW29C6,"Simple movie of a teen who is thrust to live on her own, like probably a million teens in America.  She had a positive attitude, read the bible openly and with simplicity of a young person.  It shows how God will give you little surprises along the way (Mr. Futt, the $2500 watch, social worker)  Unfair things happens in life: foreclosure, job loss, cancer, divorce, death, run away kids.

7066432,5,B00UOW29C6,"It's unfortunate that most Christian movies don't have the budget that Hollywood produced movies get, but they do with what they have and God adds the rest . . . He did, after all, feed over five thousand people with just five loaves of bread and two fish. Loved the disappearing letters btw.

Savanah McMahon did a wonderful job in this movie - not that the others didn't, but since she was the leading character she was in the spotlight. Some might say this movie was predictable - but who cares? It wasn't meant to be a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thriller. It is a very nice family / Christian movie placing God in the foreground where He belongs.

Coming from a person who was homeless for a spell I wish I had that luxurious storage room; but, I also didn't have God in my life at that time so a cold, hard-packed floor in a barn had to suffice.

Thank you Savanah, Bill, Julie, Laura, Taquito and the rest for a truly enjoyable moment.",1512518400,10,943,4.47093023255814

For a person so young to have that kind of trust in the Creator is rare in these modern times.  The social worker's genuine caring was touching.  The dad's exoneration was a breath of relief because with the movie near the finish line, I had wondered if he would be.  But then, no need to doubt, not with the daughter's faith in a God who did not fail her.

7066472,5,B00UOW29C6,"This film somehow made me willing to suspend my typical expectations for realism and fast-paced, twisting plots to slow down and enjoy a sweet, somewhat fairytale story with some really good acting. I was especially impressed with the young lead actress Savanah McMahon, as well as Julie Van Lith's very credible performance as a caring social worker, and Bill Wetherill as the very lovable father who is falsely accused of a crime and ends up in prison. The story highlights some of the very real problems that face homeless children. I'll even give kudos to Taquito as the very cute and chubby FuttMan (a shorthaired black and white terrior who befriends Savanah). It was definitely worth watching.",1496880000,,700,4.9914529914529915

I did appreciate the Christian perspective and there were a few tender moments, but overall, it was just ok- not great.  It's not something I would watch again or even remember a week from now.

I read the reviews before watching the movie and I am surprised at the negative reviews. People should lighten up and take it for what it is.  This is not some fancy big budget Hollywood film with A list actors.  But the message is sweet and the story was interesting.

7066481,5,B00UOW29C6,"This truly was a well made and powerful movie about trusting God and reflecting God's love to others.  Savanah McMahon is outstanding and the social worker Julie Van Lith displays a wonderful example of work being more than just a job.  She sets out to do everything she can to help a young girl in very difficult circumstances by giving her unconditional love and kindness.  The music was really good and the acting was great.

In this movie Savanah McMahon acknowledges every gift from God no matter how small and gives the Lord thanks and praise for all He does for her.  A Box of Faith encourages us in a lovely way not to take anything for granted.  This wonderful movie focuses on how it truly is the little things in life that matter. No matter how tiny a victory may appear, be thankful to God and know that through Christ you truly can do all things.  This is one of the very best Christian movies I have ever seen.

Here are some other Christian movies that I will also be writing excellent reviews for: October Baby, Camp Harlow, Miracles from Heaven, Letters to God, and of course, Fire Proof and Facing the Giants.

Another really good dvd was WWJD what would Jesus do? This stars John Schneider. Great for witnessing. This movie was followed up by WWJD the woodcarver, which basically showed 2 people sitting down talking about the Bible. They certainly meant well, but I was looking for more. The third movie in this saga is called what would Jesus do? The Journey Continues. This is a continuation of the original again with John Schneider. Not as good as the first, but a good dvd with some help from the fast forward button at times.

77 Chances is a very different type of movie. Rachel Hendrix and Erin Bethea are such blessings in this film, I would definitely recommend the movie, if you don't mind fast forwarding on occasion. A bit like 50 first dates except the message is to learn to listen to what God is telling us through our difficult circumstances.

I recently ordered and expecting to arrive any day This is our Time and The Redemption of Henry Myers which I am really looking forward to. Almost forgot, last month I watched a dvd called Saving Winston which was also pretty good, especially as a witness for struggling teens.

Finally I would like to share something I always do before watching a movie that you might want to consider. I put the dvd on and leave the screen on the main menu and then I pray for everyone in the movie.

I pray for the writers, producers, directors, actors, and actresses. I pray for anyone who has ever watched the movie and anyone who ever will. I pray for their salvation, witness, health, happiness, safety and loved ones, and for them to praise Jesus with their lives.

As I watch the dvd, I receive a lot of joy knowing I have prayed for everyone in the movie. It gives me more of a connection with them, especially knowing the hope of actually meeting them one day and becoming great friends for all of eternity in Heaven.

God's richest blessings to all..",1495584000,,3027,4.518315018315018

If you can only stomach big budget, polished Hollywood movies, then this may not be for you. BUT, if you can appreciate a sweet, uplifting film with a positive message and a clean storyline - albeit on a lower budget - then you really may like this one.

It has a Christian message, but it does not come across as preachy. In fact, the message is, for the most part, very subtle, and instead focuses on HOW a young girl manages when left to her one resources once her father has been put in jail. It is her positive attitude that gets her through it, and this film tells more by example (how she lives and what she does) than by words.

I really enjoyed it. It did have its questionable moments, but the young actress who played the lead did a good job. I would be interested to see her in more. The social worker hunting her down was also good, as was the male social worker. The father was very likable too. I would have like to know more about how the homeless girl really survived, as it did not show too clearly how she was handling some things (where was she using the restroom at night in a storage facility? Dogs have to go out frequently - wouldn't someone see her if she was taking the dog out often? Or wouldn't it bark and give her away? Things like that may seem trivial, but when a person is homeless, they really become a HUGE focus of survival). I also would have liked to have seem certain themes more developed, such as the use of the messages, or how her faith pulled her through.

Yet all in all, it was a unique, original film, and the contrast between the lead and the homeless girl without any faith was something to ponder.

If you are looking for a simple, clean, uplifting movie, and do not need it to be a big budget Hollywood, super-polished flick, give this one a go!",1491350400,15,1825,4.247838616714698
7066511,1,B00UOW29C6,"The message from the story of this film is very nice.  Unfortunately, that is the beginning and the end of anything nice about it.  The whole film appeared to have been produced on a $10.00 budget - no production values whatsoever.  I was totally misled by so many four- and five-star reviews written by former viewers: it is about the worst excuse for entertainment I've seen in years.  The screenplay was very shallow, the ""on location"" elements consisted simply a few barren rooms and a local public park (not particularly well maintained), the actors were amateurish, stiff, and rather unattractive, and on and on.  I could not go beyond half-way through the roughly 90-minute torture before bailing out.

7066512,4,B00UOW29C6,"Unusual living quarters for a street child since nearly all ""self storage"" locations have rigorous ingress/egress procedures and regularly recurring rental payment requirements.  Keeping a dog in such a place was even more improbable given natural tendencies of dogs to excrete all over such environments.  The dog later runs off but is found near the end of the film.  Bringing in another street child stretched plausibility yet further.  That guest then steals a communication and money intended for Dior, watches where Dior ""hides"" the proceeds of pawning an antique watch and temporarily steals Dior's entire finances before responding to pangs of conscience.  An uplifting story with a complete happy ending devoid of connections to the felony tax evading, slave mongering, hate mongering against male citizens, war mongering for purposes of ""sacrificing"" yet more male citizens in foreign wars created for the purpose, male baby raping, belligrerent blaspheming ""religion"" gangs who claim ""faith"" as relating to their criminality.",1491091200,,1036,5.573248407643312

(FYI, pedophiles are often drawn to churches b/c they think they're good sources of victims & b/c they're also seeking forgiveness & redemption.)  I'll never understand why I had to have those experiences, but I know the Lord had a reason.  I had a dream many years ago in which Jesus was sitting at the head of the bed while I was being abused, holding my hand and reassuring me that He was there & felt my pain.  The memory of that dream has been a comfort to me ever since.  Also, on the few occasions where I have shared my experience, other women have told me that the Lord's having been there for me through the ensuing years has been a help & comfort to them.

In addition, 20 years ago I was diagnosed w/ back problems.  They got progressively worse until I was finally told I had a congenital back condition that has caused me to have nearly every back malady known to man (except a severed spinal cord) w/ no hope for surgery or treatment of any kind.  I'm expected to get progressively worse and will have to live on increasing doses of pain meds until the Lord takes me home.  I can only stand for about 10 seconds at a time, walk very short distances w/ a walker, and can't even sleep in a bed any longer.  Yet the Lord continues to give me the strength to endure.  More people than I can count have told me what a witness I've been to them b/c of my strength in handling my disability, yet I can't take the credit.  It all goes to the Lord.  My prayers have not been answered in a ""name it,claim it"" format as was illustrated in the movie, but they HAVE been answered!  In the meantime, I've been given the strength to endure.

In order to have God's presence working in your life as illustrated in ""Box of Faith"" or in what I've told you about my life, you must 1st accept Jesus Christ as your Savior from your sin & as Lord of your life.  Once you're His child, you can enjoy His blessings, no matter what adversity you face, as Dior & I have.",1489276800,,2547,4.1507128309572305

However, even though they speak of God many times in this film, I found it odd that they never once mentioned Jesus Christ...hmmm",1488672000,,296,5.1875
7066540,5,B00UOW29C6,"This movie was not perfect, but my wife and I really enjoyed it, we were engaged for the entire 90 minutes.  As the main character is in a very tough situation, she is totally dependent on God and speaks that un-ashamably to others.  Her prayers are of thanks to God as often as they are a request for anything.  Some will argue the theology is not correct, I say it is full of the Love of God and people that care about each other and want to do the right thing.  That is the heart of God's message for us, love Him, trust Him, and love each other.

The film is almost 2 years old and I do not recall having heard of it before.  Thankfully Amazon Prime suggested it.

Technically my biggest concern was the ambient audio at times covers up the dialog, especially near the beginning.  I suggest turning on Closed Captions.  There are a few scenes it is required no matter how good your hearing is.  The hide and seek with the Social Worker did not seem plausible, but I quickly forgave that.  The acting was good, especially considering the very low budget.  If this was a $5 Million film I would give it 4 stars, but I think they did a wonderful job!",1488585600,,1151,4.253456221198157

If the character portrayed as Emma would have made the connection to the Box as being a connection with Jesus, I think that this movie would have been more Christ-focused. His name was not mentioned anywhere. I almost felt as thought the box represented the Christmas tree, and the slips of paper that were stuck to the roof of the storage building were the presents. God is not Santa Claus. I know that this movie was low budget, but imparting truth based upon God's word is a lot more important than ""feeling good"".",1488585600,6,604,4.5

Positives:  good acting, especially by Savanah McMahon.
Cute storyline.
Interesting aspect on spirituality.

Negatives:
Some cinematography issues.  Waving camera angles, and a lot of ""look past stuff in the foreground"" kind of shots.  The filming was unsteady and nearly spoiled the movie.
Soundtrack was too loud at times, which overshadowed the dialogue.
No resolution for secondary character Emma.  Sort of a loose end.

7066545,3,B00UOW29C6,"Just another hokey ""religious"" movie with poor theology and no clear presentation of the gospel. The disappearing paper notes to God
was proof that alot of seekers want miracles and demand ""magic"" from a genie in the bottle instead of truly trusting in a un-seen
God and having to really wait long and hard for answers to life's hardest times. Not just mere days where God grants these people every desire. What would this girl have done had God let her dad go away to prison for years??? How many old ladie's would give her 4500.00 watches to sell in real life??  The father ""actor"" was horrible in this part, overacting every movement and emotion on his face. I won't remember this movie in a week's time due to a non-true Christian message, being a real Joel Olsteen type movie with a false message about a prosperity God who all you have to do is ask him for any thing  and he instantly grants your wishes . LIES. True life is much harder... much more difficult and true faith is developed in the waiting on God in HIS time not ours.",1488240000,12,1037,4.424083769633508

It is also about tough circumstances, homelessness, and making each moment a treasure.  The movie moves forward at a very calm pace.  Perhaps soothing is a better word.  As it unfolds, it teaches us some important lessons about life, God, thankfulness, and righteousness.

7066556,3,B00UOW29C6,"I just watched the movie ""A Box of Faith"".  It was very sweet and I enjoyed it. I thought the acting was good, especially Dior and the social worker. However, I couldn't get over the fact that the writers/producers/whomever did not have a change of wardrobe for Dior.  She was in the same outfit the whole movie!  Although there was a hint of a shower when Dior came out of somewhere with a towel around her head, she was still in the same clothes, which by this time should have been quite rank.  And have anyone of the adults in charge of this movie ever spent a few minutes inside of one of these hot boxes?? Can anyone say ""ventilation""? Having worked for a Foster Care Division in a State office, there is no way in real life that a caseworker would have the time she spent hanging around a park.  Her caseload would be too big/busy to spend so much time on one child. There were several other issues that bothered me but I'll stop.  All in all, it was a sweet movie suitable for the young who would probably overlook the issues I pointed out.  Guess I'm too old....sigh.

I like how Dior was calm and cool headed and kept focused on the daily tasks and did not worry, but thanked God and trusted Him to take care of all of her needs. A feel good movie.",1486166400,,587,4.25

7066640,5,B00UOW29C6,"I loved this movie. So refreshing and good. I highly recommend it if you are looking for an inspirational story of a teenagers' simple faith in God and how all things work together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. The Box of Faith from which Dior wrote her letters to God and her simple yet confident trust in Him touched my heart. I liked the supernatural aspect of the movie where her letters to God disappear each morning from the ceiling of the storage unit that she is living in. The contrast of the two teenage runaways shows the difference in their choices. One out of rebellion against parental authority, and the other out of necessity because of her father being put in prison due to false accusations. There was also a touch of romance woven into the movie which left me with a smile. Awww. How sweet. God is sooo Good and this movie is all about that.",1485993600,2,902,4.407185628742515

There are some tender and touching moments in this film that may bring a smile to your face or tear to your eye. This young girl faces a test of her faith in difficulty but through her resourcefulness and trust in God is able to survive. Savanah McMahon is a great young actress with great potential in movies. I saw her also in the starring role in ""Desert Redemption"" and she was superb in that one. The social worker in this film, Julie Van Lith, also deserves kudos for her wonderful performance. This film demonstrates compassion, friendship, and love throughout making it a great learning experience for the audience. We all face hardships and struggles in life. But that should not prevent us from living the life we are called to live. We may not see results as magical as the ones in this film.

Now, I watched the entire film in one setting and never stopped once due to boredom. A good sign because this means that the film is of high quality at least in my opinion. Why did I like it so much? Three main reasons. First, I had to acknowledge that the film's premise was very relatable. Second, I believe this film will instill many relevant life lessons on you the viewer as it did on me. Third, I loved the heartwarming ending where everything worked out for the characters in the film. Finally, I would want to lend a helping hand to any production studio producing these types of films because we all are in need of inspiration because everywhere we look around us all we see are the problems and not the solutions in life.

7066935,4,B00UOW29C6,Cute movie,1484179200,,10,4.5
7066936,5,B00UOW29C6,"To start with, I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did. Having enjoyed Courageous, God's not Dead (1 & 2,) Woodlawn, etc., I am well aware of what's possible when talented people of faith decide to put a lot of hard work into a movie. David A.R. White, for example has really raised the bar in this area.

Another potential concern I have is the issue of bad theology. A number of ""faith-based"" movies have come out recently which model decidedly un-Christian behaviors and beliefs, not as an admonishment, but as the apologetic itself. This is not only confusing to non-believers and seekers, but outrageous to believers.

Fortunately, ""A Box of Faith"" suffers from neither of these flaws. It is well acted, produced, and edited. It also appears to portray sound theology.

Casting was equally well done here. At first, the actor playing the girl's father was a little difficult for me to accept, but as the character was developed, the choice made more sense. Nor did the teenage protagonist ever give me doubts.

The message was also well handled. The behavior of the protagonists says more than any of their dialogue. In this, they communicated more effectively than most typical Sunday sermons.

There were some challenges that viewers may have. We're asked early on to accept that the protagonist is a girl of deep faith. This is presumably because of a combination of her mother's example and spiritual challenges that she has faced in the loss of her mother. This wasn't well established initially, but the idea is there if you look for it. With that in mind, when the unthinkable happens leaving her alone with few resources and no recourse, when she simply places her faith in God, and obeys His direction, it is consistent and believable.

Many will, no doubt, find this incredulous anyway. However, to anyone who has ever truly had to rely on God, or who has had their faith tested, then this is simply a normal and expected reaction on her part. In fact, viewers may be tempted to dismiss the magnitude of the disaster faced by this girl simply because her faith and actions, not to mention the way her needs are met, show that God is completely in control. She doesn't appear to be in distress because she isn't. But she is in a challenging, uncertain, and dangerous situation.

Contrast this with someone in the same situation but without faith. The fear, uncertainty, and loss would be overwhelming. We don't sense any of that from this character. Not because of a bad script or bad acting (the acting was surprisingly good,) but because of her faith, and the working of the Holy Spirit in her life. This is what life is like for the truly faithful. Good things happen, and you are grateful. Bad things happen and God makes the suffering bearable, and you are grateful for that as well. Uncertainty is always a part of life, but when you have undergone the supernatural change that comes the Holy Spirit, then you know with certainty that faith in God is not a fairy-tale, and he actually does provide in ways that mere coincidence cannot account for.

One issue that my wife initially found frustrating was the incident with the father's employer. She found it unbelievable that a situation so obviously contrived could really happen. However, I pointed out that this is actually a common occurrence, and is far more believable for me than something more complex. A malicious employee, and a disconnected business owner, have long been part of a recipe for injustice. For this, wise men have said, ""Better ten guilty men go free, than one innocent be imprisoned."" In a society overrun with crime, it's difficult to adopt that perspective.

Overall, I found this movie inspirational as a study of faith and suffering. Jesus admonished us that following him is fraught with peril, and that we will suffer. Not that we may suffer, but that we will. So why follow him knowing that? It's simple. When you give your life to Christ, and put your faith in Him, you will never be alone no matter how bad it gets. We will all suffer at some point in our life. Why do it alone, when help is to be found from our Creator. ""A Box of Faith"" is a reminder that God is in charge, and that with faith Him we will receive what we need to endure the mess that we made of His creation, until his return.",1484179200,6,4313,4.6422018348623855

7066957,2,B00UOW29C6,"This movie is probably better marketed as a family film rather than a Christian film. Why?Because this movie reduces God to a fictional character who seems to grant answers to prayer like a genie would his master's wish. Dior seems highly intelligent and resourceful, but her prayer life consists of writing to God with childish affirmations that have a New Age vibe. There is barely any Scripture here,presumably not to offend an audience who might not share the same faith. Neither is there a follow up to the father's initial mention of a bible passage after he winds up in jail. Surely the threat of prison was trying enough for the father to deepen his own faith during his ordeal, but the filmmakers missed that opportunity in favor of giving Dior a Disney hero's journey. Instead of Dior quoting scripture periodically to explain her beliefs when she is challenged by anyone,she makes ""God takes care of me"" sound more like ""Because I said so!"" Also troubling is that she would share her method of talking to God with her street friend,but nothing that might convince someone discouraged by life to seek God for themselves.

If you want a film with a smart heroine and a positive attitude, A Box of Faith is acceptable fare. If you are hoping to share any aspects of the Christian faith with your children,don't expect much.",1484006400,8,1331,4.761904761904762

Dior is a very well adjusted 16 year old given all that she has been through- honestly I think she could teach me a few things about being an adult and responsible.  The story had the predictable happy ending- and that is a GREAT thing!  Too many movies today focus on the negative or at best have an ambiguous ending.  The entire point of watching a movie is to escape reality, which has enough negativity (just watch the evening news).  It is wonderful to watch a show where things work out for the positive- the show was uplifting and inspired hope that even a dire situation can have a good outcome given hard work and faith- an attitude that is hard to maintain, which is why shows like this are so important.  The acting was actually decent as well.  The only question I have is what happened to Emma.  I knew she was trouble from the start, but it would have been nice to know if she does undergo the much needed attitude adjustment after interacting with Dior.",1483833600,6,1085,4.4393939393939394

If I were to mention one of the little things that don't happen in real life you would think I'm nit picking. However, all of them put together just made this unbearable for me. Too many times I think we accept sub-par because of the message, and that isn't commensurate with greatness of God. If the idea is to have family entertainment, and your fine with dialogue no one would say in a certain situation, continuity problems, suspending common knowledge of how our justice system works, but it has a Christian theme; by all means this is a decent movie for you. However, if your looking for a Godly movie that comes close to the quality the evil humans in Hollywood produce with Satan directing, this is no where close. There is a reason were losing the culture war as far as films role in it; we don't let Christian venture capitalists know there is a market for it, and we don't demand better quality. There is an argument to be made that if we turn out in droves for movies like this then maybe better movies will be made. However, I almost turned this off when a guy gets put in prison for almost stealing a $15 digital multi-meter that never left the owners property, and then heard that a judge was somehow letting anyone know he's vacillating between terms of 3 and 5 years w/o a verdict that we'd heard of.

7067107,2,B00UOW29C6,"Once again, another poorly written Christian movie. The filmography and acting weren't too bad, but the script was.  It is very unrealistic. Still trying to figure out how a child protective services case manager can just sit around all day at a park. The dad was arrested for theft because someone placed something in his cooler--when coolers are checked daily as employees leave, yet the employer didn't even consider that his employee, who had worked for him for years, would have to be a complete moron to try to steal something that way. Even my children were laughing at how ridiculous parts of this movie were, especially when the case worker, who only has met the dad twice in jail, kisses him when she greets him for his first date. Honestly, watching this was like a train wreck--I would have stopped watching but was curious to know what happened. I really can't believe the  high reviews for this film. I had high expectations based upon the reviews--maybe if I hadn't read them beforehand, my expectations wouldn't have been as high.",1482883200,5,1046,4.805555555555555

Totally did not expect to even like the movie, since I've seen other Christian movies that were just too preachy and corny.  On second thought, the goose bumps probably happened because how I arrived at seeing this movie.  I've been needing a lot of prayers and having many questions about personal things that have happened recently.  After the midday Mass, I just wanted some light stuff to watch while eating lunch.  While browsing through my usual list of horror and action movies, this was the only one that didn't belong in that list.  Needless to say, I saw my sign. . .
Also for the goose bumps, I actually know real people such as the main characters in this movie, who are good for goodness sake.  This movie didn't appear preachy to me because I can identify how it imitates life with genuine Christian folks who seem to plow through life and through all hardships without becoming bitter, paranoid, envious, or greedy.  Definitely a good family movie for all to enjoy.",1481673600,48,1035,4.743016759776537

Spoilers-------------- Dad wouldn't have been put in prison, social worker wouldn't have let a girl stay on the street or leave notes with money on her car in the park without a cop ready to pick her up, the friend wouldn't have stolen just 20 bucks and a note thinking it was $2500 while shining a flashlight in the main girls face while she leaves, someone at the storage unit is getting fired for not checking at night for lights or watching the cameras to see people coming and going; + she stole someones dog named Futt(really)?...
