7889523,1,6305386471,"i tried this to add soem variety to my post prego workouts, and i found it very disappointing....the workout really doesn't even include your baby, the bands are used, which are ok, but the whole concept of working out with your baby is exagerated here...i would save my money next time and skip this one.",1075939200,3,305,4.5636363636363635
7889524,1,6305386471,"i tought this would be a workout that incorporated my baby, but it does not. It was a misleading title. The video is poor any way. The instructor is poor, the quality is poorly done. I highly recommend LEISA HART'S FITMAMA POSTNATAL AND FITMAMA & ME Videos instead, they are new and so muc better.",1070755200,4,297,4.418181818181818
7889525,4,6305386471,"I have definitely gotten results from this workout. Six weeks after purchasing this video, I am now in better shape than I was before I got pregnant(although I would recommend investing in a step to go with it--I saw more results after I bought a step). Becky is very charming, the other ladies are real women (not perfect models), and the babies are SO cute. My only complaint is this: For some reason, left and right are reversed in her workout. I don't know if it is a technical flaw in the way the video was shot, but when she tells you to do something on the right leg or arm, she is doing it with her left leg and arm. Very confusing, as I am slightly dyslexic, and even after doing this tape 6 days a week, I still get messed up sometimes.
But it really is a great workout, and my baby loves the ""baby play"" at the end.",1054339200,,826,4.136645962732919
7889526,1,6305386471,"I bought this video thinking that it would be a good way to exercise and entertain my baby at the same time.  Big mistake!  This video only includes a 4 minutes segment with the baby and it is lame!  So, if you are looking for something fun to do with your baby, this is not it.  Also, it involves a step portion so if you don't have a step then you will not be able to do the entire cardio portion.  It also requires free weights or an xertube which you can get with a different version but I was not aware of this so I could not do the weight portion.  All in all, I was extremely disappointed!",1035849600,17,596,3.966386554621849
7889527,5,6305386471,This video reminded me of why I needed to start exercising!  I was out of breath within a few minutes.  It's definitely a good workout.  I was in average shape before I got pregnant and exercised when I could while I was pregnant.  I really need to get going again and this did it:),1018396800,2,282,4.166666666666667
7889528,5,6305386471,The workout for Mom and Baby developed by Becky Cortez is a wonderful way for Moms to readjust in the post-natal period. Becky tempers her workouts for a gentle restoration of muscle tone as well as incorporating exercises for the more resilient and enthusiastic clients. I would definitely recommend this video for any woman!,986169600,2,326,5.055555555555555
7889529,5,6305386471,What a great way to bond with your new baby while getting your body back to it's pre-pregnancy form!  Becky's workout is just right for new moms and what can be more convenient than to have her right in your home to workout anytime your baby's schedule permits.  I loved Becky's enthusiasm and coaching throughout the video - it made the workout easy and FUN!,985824000,2,359,4.507692307692308
7889530,5,6305386471,It was hard for me to get motivated about working out after my baby was born - this video really helped me get excited about getting in shape!!  I can tell the difference already.  I highly recommend it.,984009600,,203,4.315789473684211
7889531,5,6305386471,I bought the video after I had my second child and was hooked. I instantly connected with Becky. It is a fun workout and I have used it for over two years now. Thumbs Up!,983923200,,170,3.8857142857142857
