6139817,5,B00H7T56IS,This is a good movie with a great cast.  I would think a lot of people would really enjoy seeing it.,1400716800,,100,3.761904761904762
6139818,5,B00H7T56IS,"I've been waiting for years for Funny Face to come out on Blu-ray and the wait was worth it.  Filmed in Vista-Vision on location in Paris, the film contains many beautiful shots with eye-popping detail.  This was one of Fred Astaire's last great film musicals and Audrey Hepburn has never looked more stylish.  Also of note is a rare film appearance by Kay Thompson as the fashion editor, she's terrific.  Directed by Stanley Donen.",1399680000,,432,4.797297297297297
6139819,5,B00H7T56IS,",,,,,,,,with all the recent complaints about blu ray quality on classic musical releases,it is a pleasure to report how gorgeous 'funny face'looks,,,,.sure the movie is a bit dated,old fashion,but for lovers of those old movie musicals,this one is for you.looks better now then it did in movie theaters back in the fifties...",1399680000,,325,5.269230769230769
6139820,5,B00H7T56IS,"I was so happy when this was released on Blu-ray. I have the DVD from 2001, and it leaves A LOT to be desired in the picture quality department. I can't compare it to the numerous other DVD editions though. I can say it is definitely worth the upgrade, it looks s'marvelous! The BD also has 5 documentaries. My DVD only had one... I'm very satisfied. If you like Fred Astaire or Audrey Hepburn pick it up.",1399507200,2,405,4.2727272727272725
6139821,5,B00H7T56IS,"Wonderful movie! The cinematography, actors, music all combine for a lot of fun. Audrey Hepburn showing a good range of skills with acting and dancing - a real treat to watch!",1398816000,,175,4.67741935483871
6139822,3,B00H7T56IS,"I had seen the movie before but thought I would renew my familiarity with this BR release. The BR transfer is gorgeous, colorful and scratch and dust free. There are also some very interesting extra features on both the talent and the technical aspects of the movie.

As someone who esteems musicals, Hepburn and Astaire, Stanley Donen the director, and the Gershwin music, as well as the photography of Avedon, what could go wrong? Maybe I was not in the proper receptive mood but the movie was very light weight even by musical standards. Compare to ""The Pajama Game"" from around the same time. Most of the musical numbers are forgettable as is the wimpy plot. I had to watch this over two nights as I never felt immersed in it at all. For rental only and not to buy.",1398124800,2,769,4.492857142857143
6139823,5,B00H7T56IS,"This is one of my top musicals from start to finish. However seeing it in blu ray has simply blown me away. The clarity and the magnificent  sound quality has made this a movie everyone who owns a blu ray player should buy without hesitation. The Gershwin score and the choreography is amazing and let's not forget Kay Thompson who literally brings down the house with her duet with Fred Astaire on CLAP YO' HANDS. Audrey Hepburn proves to be a fine dancer and handles her songs with great charm.(She uses her own voice and it works well with the material) This musical could have easily been a product of the great MGM studios. Roger Edens, Fred Astaire etc. Buy without hesitation.",1397865600,3,683,4.598360655737705
6139824,5,B00H7T56IS,"There have been a few reissues along the way and the one previous to this was outstanding but the blu-ray did make it better.
This is my all-time favorite movie musical.  Audrey, Fred, Kay, the Gershwin score, Paris and a great screenplay.  Hard to believe it was not written for Audrey.  Kay Thompson simply fabulous as fashion mag editor Maggie Prescott and of course Mr. Astaire is in a class by himself.  Audrey was no singer but delivers the songs delightfully as only she could. This version is 'S Wonderful!",1397347200,,514,4.677777777777778
6139825,5,B00H7T56IS,"Utterly enchanting! Audrey is simply delectable and Fred is the epitome of silky-smooth, slightly rakish charm. But it's the irresistible Kay Thompson (as a force-of-nature fashion magazine editor in the Diana Vreeland mold) who steals every scene she's in. In her tight little red vest and black pencil skirt, Kay does the impossible: she leaves Fred Astaire in the dust in ""Clap Yo' Hands."" Style, sass, verve--Kay's got 'em in spades. Opening credits and ""Think Pink"" photos by Richard Avedon are stunning. Audrey's solo dance number (she wears a long-sleeved black top and slacks, and black loafers with white socks) is so terrific it was used in a Gap ad. I loved the darkroom scene when photographer Fred sings ""I love your funny face"" to wide-eyed, gamine bookseller Audrey. Another plus: the sublime Gershwin songs throughout. Excellent special features as well including fascinating profile of Kay Thompson.",1477353600,,916,5.238095238095238

6139829,5,B00H7T56IS,One of my favorite movies with Audrey Hepburn. Beautiful actress and singer.,1451001600,,76,5.416666666666667
6139830,5,B00H7T56IS,"Audrey Hepburn singing and dancing with Fred Astair makes this a very fun movie to watch and enjoy. It's a musical comedy with a nice love story to keep the movie going.  Unlike My Fair Lady, Audrey Hepburn does her own singing.  Her dance routine in the night club is energetic and stylish and seems very contemporary.  You might see a similar dance routine on the AMA's or Oscars.  Most of the movie takes place in Paris.  There are great scenes of the city as he action moves through he city and showcases many of the famous landmarks known all over the world.  The story itself is a bit improbable, but it is a musical comedy and not meant to be realistic.  The colors are vibrant and  the dance numbers are fun to watch. If you want to watch a light funny movie, this is a good one to watch.  There are very few actresses today equal to Audrey Hepburn.  She survived the Nazi occupation of Holland, worked for the Dutch Resistance and at the height of her career, she left to join UNICEF and brought attention to Children in need all over the world.  She was a very class act.",1448496000,,1081,4.3283582089552235

The only thing I always find odd in this movie is what would a young woman want with a man so many years her senior??  Then again, the man is Astaire :-)",1413590400,,315,4.114754098360656

6139843,5,B00H7T56IS,"I only comment on a films image quality and occasionally on the sound track.  You don't need me to tell you what story or actor you should enjoy.
Funny Face image quality is first rate.  Beautiful, nicely saturated coloration, and a minimum of noise.  Even the sound track was better than average.
Having only seen the DVD before, this Blu-ray made me reevaluate the movie. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.",1401408000,2,408,4.884057971014493

Beautiful color picture with no scratches or flaking in evidence. 5.1 sound remix is fine but don't expect it to sound like today's mixes. Most of the sound is spread across the front. The sound is very clear. If you love this film, donate your DVD version to your local library and order the Blu-ray.",1400803200,,353,4.619047619047619

8630643,1,B00H7T56IS,"I am very frustrated with Paramount. I purchased the Blu-Ray of ""Funny Face"", which was shot in VistaVision and from what I remember of earlier video releases, was extremely wide - with significant letterbox bands. For some reason, this Blu-Ray version was cropped with HD dimensions, cutting off the sides of the original frame. Everything seems a bit zoomed in, because it wasn't shot that way. I find it so frustrating that the Paramount doesn't indicate this on the box.",1496016000,,474,4.9375

8630645,3,B00H7T56IS,"Good cast, especially Kay Thompson in one of her few feature film appearanceswho surprisingly ""takes stage"" away from star Fred Ataire in most
of their sequences together.  Hard to watch, however, if you were raised in the 50's and hated women's fashions during those years, especially the pill box hats.",1491004800,,304,5.08
8630646,4,B00H7T56IS,Not one model or actor in this movie is non-Caucasian.  Good movie.  Would have been nicer to include additional ethnic groups.,1486512000,,127,5.0
8630647,5,B00H7T56IS,"Funny Face is another Audrey Hepburn classic, here with Fred Astaire, Kay Thompson and the beautiful city of Paris. Audrey plays Jo Stockton, a bookshop keeper's assistant in New York who suddenly gets surprise when a photographer for a fashion magazine comes in and takes over the shop for a photo shoot. The photographer, Fred Astaire notices her in the library, different from the other models. He talks his boss (Kay Thompson) into getting Jo into the magazine as a model herself. They sweep her off to Paris to model for a designer and after a whirlwind transformation she's running around the famous landmarks of the city taking pictures. Fred and Kay to do not know however, that she has an ulterior motive to be there- she wants to discuss philosophy with a professor... and has little interest in modeling.  This film is a bright and happy musical with beautiful dance numbers and was shot on location in Paris itself for most of the outdoor shots and the ""Bonjour Paris"" number. A must have for any Audrey admirer, she and Astaire dance beautifully together.",1483401600,2,1068,4.804347826086956
