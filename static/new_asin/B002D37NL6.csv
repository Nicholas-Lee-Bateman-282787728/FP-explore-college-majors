8364752,5,B002D37NL6,Top quality show with none other than Amanda Burton as it's star. Althought she is starting to withdraw a bit and they have added two fine actors to be her assistants it is still one fine show. If you enjoy Bones you will love Sam. She is smart and never just sits back. The stories start quick and you will find yourself being drawn in very quickly. You need an all region dvd player of course but once you have one a whole new door opens for quality programs such as Silent Witness. I do suggest you start with Series one and work your way up - it is not necessary of course but that way you get to meet Sam and watch her grow.,1379980800,,629,4.04
