8164049,5,B000LSBMTY,"Sri M is a charming, brilliant and profound master of meditation and yoga. His talk in New York City in 2006 distills the essence of meditation and the Eastern traditions out of which it comes. His early life experiences as a Muslim in South India changed profoundly as he followed his dream into the Himalayas to find his Master in a cave. This led to his life of teaching at his center in India and the many people his wisdom has affected. It is a beautiful and enlightening story well told and presented on this intimate DVD.",1170460800,,528,4.453608247422681
