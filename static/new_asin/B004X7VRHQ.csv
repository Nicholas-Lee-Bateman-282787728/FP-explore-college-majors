4492617,5,B004X7VRHQ,"We first found this collection at our local library, and our 3-year-old daughter liked it well enough that we decided to purchase it since $8 seemed like a reasonable price.  We have not watched them all, but so far they each seem to be about 40 min in length.  The animations are not nearly as glitzy as Disney, but that makes for a refreshing change (and our daughter does not seem to mind that).  Some even follow the original stories better than Disney, and it is nice that they are shorter.  They appear to be produced in the early 1990s but re-released by Gaiam in 2011.  Here is a list of the films:
Disc 1--
Pocahontas
Sleeping Beauty
Snow White
Thumbelina

Disc 2--
The Little Mermaid
Alice in Wonderland
Beauty and the Beast
Cinderella

Disc 3--
Heidi
Black Beauty
Hercules
Jungle Book

Disc 4--
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Leo the Lion
Aladdin
Pinocchio",1364342400,22,864,4.564935064935065

8446391,1,B004X7VRHQ,"Very cheaply made imitation cartoons of real movies. I did not pay attention to this. My 3 year old enjoyed it one time, but I had to buy Beauty and the Beast movie because she said it was not long enough.
