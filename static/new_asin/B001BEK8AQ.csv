3491212,5,B001BEK8AQ,"This show differs from most languid, somewhat 'dull' and 'boring' History Channel documentaries by immersing you as if the show was your very own (personal) tour guide. Really enjoyed the 'Dracula' episode and the 'Ghosts of Gettysburg' Very informative historic notes of interest and decent but not over the top re enactments (History Channel take note!!). There were also the odd 'creepy' snap shots of ghouls and freaks caught on tape which did make the heart beat a bit faster! - although one little gripe to mention, more so technical..... I like some other reviewers noticed that in the episode of 'Ghosts of Gettysburg'- it was 'jumping' back to the beginning (title credits) at the end of every ad break! - Apart from that, very well done and at last a DvD worth adding to my paranormal collection! ;)",1311638400,,809,4.827338129496403
3491213,5,B001BEK8AQ,Over all it's a good product. I love learning about new things. And the paranormal has always been a big one for not only me but other ppl. I recommend this to lots of ppl that want to brush or learn about something they don't know anything about. I could watch this over and over again with ppl. As of right now I am teaching one of my close friends paranormal information and cult information.,1274400000,,395,4.28
3491214,2,B001BEK8AQ,"I got this after reading about the faulty DVD.  To get around this I thought I would rip the DVD with Handbrake but on the second show on the DVD, 'Ghosts of Gettysburg', it would only rip 8 minutes of the 45.  So I watched the DVD and sure enough it would play 8 minutes of it and then go back to the menu.  So, what I did was I ripped that title as 7 parts, each chapter individually, and then combined all the chapters with a program called mkvmerge.  I add the first chapter and then 'append' each chapter after it in order.  I get the full episode but for some reason it doesn't put chapter markers in it.

The rest of the content plays fine from the DVD and rips to hard drive just fine, it's just 'Ghosts of Gettysburg' that messes up and I fixed that by making a copy of it.

The actual content is ok, I've watched half of it by now and I have to say I like History Channel shows better.  The one on Dracula was interesting and the one on the Salem Witch trials was good and I'll update when I watch the other 3 programs on this DVD.

So, if you can make a copy like me or if you don't mind starting 'Ghosts of Gettysburg' and watching it till it quits then when you're kicked back into the menu and restarting it and skipping through the chapters to where you left off then this DVD is a pretty good DVD.  I find it hard to believe that this hasn't been fixed, I doubt this is a one run item, they had to know it was flawed but they kept making new copies of it.

So I'm taking two starts off for the faulty DVD and one off just because I didn't think the shows were the best but still worth watching.

UPDATE:  Well, I couldn't help myself and watched all of the DVD today, thought 'Why save it for later?'.  Anyway, it all worked fine, just the 'Ghosts of Gettysburg' had problems playing like I said above.  I still don't think they are as good as what is on the History Channel, not as well acted in the reenactments and not as information rich either.  They are still worth a watch though, so bear in mind if it wasn't for the faulty DVD then I would have given it a 4 star rating, just one star off because of content.",1268524800,6,2133,4.042857142857143
3491215,5,B001BEK8AQ,"I am always leary of purchasing my ""paranormal"" DVDs becuase I when I receive it, it usually turns out to be a bunch of made-for-tv programs that I've seen and/or ordered before--they just CHANGED THE NAME OF THE DVD. (which really ticks me off--who do they think they're fooling?) But this DVD was awesome and I have NONE of these segements on other ""paranormal"" DVDs--although (this being from Travel Channel) I do vaguely remember (obviously) seeing some of these on that channel before (to be expected) but was VERY Surprised by the IN-DEPTH segment on Dracula. I've never seen it before nor even heard of most of the tales connected. This DVD was well worth it!!!! You will NOT be disappointed! (Others on here have complained about DVD not working properly--that may be with theirs, but ours worked perfectly fine).",1248480000,34,821,4.871428571428571
3491216,3,B001BEK8AQ,"This was a gift to a friend, so I didn't watch it myself until later, when there was a slight problem on the DVD itself. One section on Gettysburg, would not go to the indivual breaks, but if you go back to the menu, start all over again and ff until you get to the next section, then you can see it.  It's not like only the first section was there, the entire story of the ghosts of Gettysburg were there, you just had to work to see it all. The breaks probably occured for commericals for the original broadcast. No other problems with any of the other subjects. Hopefully it was a problem with just the one DVD.",1247616000,7,614,4.159663865546219
3491217,4,B001BEK8AQ,"I enjoyed the DVD Paranormal Destinations. It is 4 hours and 11 minutes of interesting narrative. It takes you to Transylvania in search for the truth of Dracula...I thought I knew alot about the Dracula legend but I learned more from this DVD. It then takes you to Gettysburg and different locations and Inns that are associated with the Civil War. It follows a paranormal team as it investigates a few alleged haunted location. The Witches of Salem was also very informative. The second half of the DVD has Lake Monsters, Bigfoot and Alien encounters. Personally I am not as interested in monsters as I am in ghosts and hauntings but the DVD does present this subject matter in a facinating manner. The only drawback to the DVD is the skipping of the DVD over the entire Gettysburg episode. It takes you back to the beginning of the episode at the start of every chapter....really annoying but it only does this during the Gettysburg episode. I recommend this for all who are interested in the paranormal.",1247443200,2,1007,4.7272727272727275
3491218,3,B001BEK8AQ,"If it hadn't been for the truly AWFUL dvd I was sent, I would have rated this a 5/5. The content of the program is great, from start to finish. The dvd however, made my blood pressure go through the roof. During the Ghosts of Gettysburg  portion, the dvd would continually go back to the main menu every 10-12 minutes. I would then have to FF the dvd to a point just beyond the last ""break"". It was a nightmare. I don't know of anyone else has had a similar problem....hopefully I'm not the only one. lol",1228521600,20,504,4.195876288659794
3491219,5,B001BEK8AQ,"A lot of people have waited along time, and hoped that the Travel Channel would release this on dvd. It concest of Weird travels - Lake monsters, Bigfoot, and alein encounters. Mysterious journeys - hunt for Dracula, ghosts of Gettysburg, witches of Salem. I was hoping that the creepy creatures would be on it, It would be super if they do more of these dvds. Thank you so much travel channel.",1225929600,21,394,4.563380281690141
3491220,5,B001BEK8AQ,Truly awesome dvd from the Travel Channel concerning the many destinations with paranormal activity.

8283042,2,B001BEK8AQ,Ghosts of Gettysburg shuts down a few minutes into and every few minutes had to restart the DVD and FAST FORWARD thru the glitch in the DVD. This was my favorite episode on the DVD but it was very glitchy. In my opinion the Travel channel could have been more selective about what was on this DVD... It is ok... If you buy it would recommend trading it ii for something else.,1367625600,,375,4.222222222222222

Update:
Got my four hour and eleven minute disc
that has:
--MYSTERIOUS JOURNEYS--
""THE HUNT FOR DRACULA""
""GHOSTS OF GETTYSBERG""
""THE WITCHES OF SALEM""
***************************
--WEIRD TRAVELS--
""LAKE MONSTERS""
""BIGFOOT""
""ALIEN ENCOUNTERS""

What you might want to know is that, indeed,there IS a problem with the episode
""GHOSTS OF GETTYSBERG"".
Each chapter break --- about four --- will stop and return to the TOP MENU.
The episode was well-worth the hassle of restarting the program in fast-forward
--- [ watching the time counter on your machine ] ---
to just a bit past the time the counter slows but is unable to return to the beginning menu.
Hit ""PLAY"" to resume the episode. In about ten-minutes, it'll happen again.
--- {[ watching the counter out of the corner of your eye ]}
Repeat the process and remember to look for the SECOND pause and hit play... etc., etc.

8283046,4,B001BEK8AQ,"This was a very nice combination of historical and paranormal information. I did have some difficulty getting the DVD to play through on one of the episodes (Civil War), requiring numerous restarts and fast-forwarding to move from scene to scene. This may have been only a problem with my disc specifically, not a product problem generally. Either way, it was worth the purchase.",1338336000,,379,5.031746031746032
