This is a great compilation of some of the best of her talents.  You will laugh all through these episodes and if you were sad before you see a couple of these, you won't be afterwards.  Although she is known for her funniness, she is really a very beautiful, classy, elegant woman who had a great sense of the ridiculous, and on occasion, the sublime.  I would love to see a compilation of The Lucy Show, as has been done with all the I Love Lucy programs.",1176249600,,592,4.166666666666667
