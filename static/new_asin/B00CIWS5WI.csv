8582220,4,B00CIWS5WI,"Released in France as ""Une affaire d'tat"" way back in 2009 it has now finally made it to the UK. This then is a dark and complicated tale. We start with an explosion on an aeroplane and the murder of a `call girl' that le gendarmes think may be linked. We have some politicians so corrupt that they make Watergate look like a slight misunderstanding. We have the excellent Andre Dussollier as the governments `go to' guy to make things happen or disappear.

He has a rather handy assassin whom he uses to take out quite a number of extras and is played by the really rather good Thiery Fremont. Then there is the Madame who runs her own little crime empire and the girls do more than just `turn tricks' but some are clearly getting a bit too much pillow talk. Throw into the mix a hostage situation, arms deals and a great musical score and you have all the ingredients for a rather good crime thriller.

This is obviously in French and has very good sub titles. The CGI will not have you gasping and is a shame but you can't win em all. The acting is all really impressive and the framing of the shots and direction is excellent; not a duff performance to be seen and more twists than a twist fest. I actually really enjoyed it, at 99 minutes it was timed and paced perfectly, just a shame it took so long for a release but at least we got one and it was worth the wait.",1382140800,,1371,4.229007633587786
