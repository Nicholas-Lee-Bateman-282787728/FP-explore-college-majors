2524272,3,B000EN6N4A,"`Heaven's Soldiers' is a South Korean film, a curious mixture of action, comedy, and science fiction. In the year 2005, North Korean soldiers led by a patriotic military officer (Kim Seung-Wu) plan to steal a nuclear weapon that was jointly produced by the South Korea and the North Korea. During the fierce battle of the North Korean soldiers who fight the South Korean soldiers, a huge comet appears in the sky, which transports both of them back to the year 1572. And they find themselves in the middle of another bloody battlefield, among the warriors holding a sword.

The soldiers from the 21st century successfully beat the invading foreign warriors mercilessly killing the people of the country, and are even hailed as `Heaven's Soldiers' by them. While the soldiers from the future try to figure out the way to travel back to their world through time, they find a thief in dirty clothes stealing their guns.

[Yi Sun Shin] The thief turns out young Yi Sun Shin (Park Jung-Hun) before he becomes a national hero. Now you must remember that Yi Sun Shin is one of the most important persons in the history of Korea because he defeated the Japanese navy in 1592 under great disadvantages. What is shocking to these Korean soldiers is, however, this young Yi Sun Shin is far from the image of the great admiral. He was still a weak, selfish, and pampered youth, who needs to learn much more in order to be the hero who is to save their country from the forces of Japanese military.

Like many films from South Korea, the tone of `Heaven's Soldiers' suddenly changes. It is sometimes serious, then comical, and again very serious, and when it is serious, it gets very emotional. The plot itself is not the strongest part; it is full of plot holes, and the comedy sketches (including some familiar jokes) are not what you call refined.

The final battle scenes go on more than 10 minutes, and they are violent and exciting. The film starts with a plot about a nuclear weapon, but that part is nearly forgotten in the middle section of the film, which, quite frankly,  seems to drag.

Some part of the film's script may remind you of `Star Trek: First Contact,"" but you don't find many sci-fi elements here. As in `Shiri' `Heaven's Soldiers' is a fairly good action film with a message about the divided country, and as such it is entertaining.",1159660800,,2345,4.6658595641646485
2524333,5,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" is a delightful Korean film directed by Min Joon Gi.  One part comedy, one part action film, and one part history lesson, ""Heaven's Soldiers"" ultimately serves as an argument for Korean reunification.  The film opens with North and South Korean generals negotiating the surrender of a jointly built nuclear weapon, which international opinion has forced them to disarm.  In the middle of the negotiations, the nuclear weapon is stolen by a renegade N. Korean officer and several of his soldiers.  Attempting an escape on riverboats, the S. Koreans eventually catch up to the escapees, and a battle ensues.  However, at the height of the firefight, both sides are swept up by a meteor and transported back to the year 1572.  Upon their arrival, the two sides run into a young and yet-to-be great Yi Sun-Sin.  The modern Koreans initially have trouble identifying Yi Sun-Sin, since instead of the heroic general they all know from history books, he is a bumbling ginseng smuggler.  Many critics of the film felt this portrayal of a national hero to be a slap in the face (akin to an American film maker portraying George Washington as a moronic hemp smuggler).  From this point on, the inevitable trajectory of the film includes the coming of age story of Yi Sun-Sin, as well as the unity between the N. and S. Koreans to battle a common enemy.  Both these stories play off each other, with the modern Koreans desperate to convince Yi Sun-Sin to accept his destiny, who in turn is disgusted by the N. and S. Koreans inability to work together.  These intertwined plots reach their culmination at the end of the film, with Yi Sun-Sin serving as a symbolic unifier between the two sides.  The film's climax is rather predictable, but is still one of the most emotionally powerful and exciting conclusions to an historical epic film.  ""Heaven's Soldiers"" is a top notch film, and has something to offer everyone.",1239062400,,1927,4.856269113149847
2524334,4,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" is a fictional film based on a reunification of North and South Korean theme. In the film, North and South Korea formed an alliance to build a weapon of mass destruction but things did not go according to plan when they wanted to give the nuke to the US--the North Korean military officer Kang Min Gil decided to steal the weapon and kidnap a South Korean scientist who helped build the weapon. South Korean navy officer Park Jeong Woo was sent to capture Kang and the weapon, however in the middle of battle, a mysterious comet came crashing down and all of a sudden, it was now 1572. They appeared to again be in the middle of war against foreign invaders and with their machine guns and high tech weapons, they won and the locals bowed down and called them, ""Heaven's Soldiers.""  The North and South Korean military officials met the famous, Yi Soon Shin who in reality was an admiral that led Korea to victory over Japan but in the film, he was thief and a ginseng smuggler who didn't pass the military examination. Yi is a South Korean hero and therefore the North did not care about him but in the end, the North was willing to help. The soldiers were so shocked that Yi was not the highly regarded man that they thought he was and Park and the other soldiers taught him military education in hopes that he will pass his military examination and defeat the Japanese like he is suppose to!
This was a nationalist paradigm film because it was a national salvation drama. I found this film extremely interesting because it was made from a South Korean prospective yet they did not portray the North Koreans as barbarians rather gave them a positive image and depicted them as respectable non villains. Throughout the film, you see the separation of North and South Korea, especially from little details like the line drawn across the home and the tree branches separating the two Koreas however, Yi is always in the middle symbolizing the 38th Parallel and he always seems to cross the line or erase the line. However, when the Manchun barbarians attempt to attack the village, both North and South officials must unite together with Yi in hopes to save Korea--cooperation was paramount. Koreans had to come together with one common external enemy The soldiers all had a choice, they must use the past as a bridge, North and South were once one country, one people--will they finally put their animosity behind them and fight for their country and future decedents?",1239062400,,2488,4.680365296803653
2524335,4,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" offers a fresh perspective of Korean nationalist history, which highlights roadblocks and suggestions on the road to Korean Unification.  The film opens with a North and South Korean battle over stolen property when magically soldiers from both sides travel in time to 1572 Choson Korea. The soldiers encounter Yi-Sun Shin, who in South Korean nationalist history is a celebrated ""heroic"" general.  When Yi is met in the film however he portrayed as anything but a celebrated general, but instead insistent upon lies, corruption, and thievery to survive.  This view of Yi is controversial in the film, yet he serves the directors purpose of tying in ideals of unification between the North and South troops.  Yi consistently breaks down social barriers between the troops, forcing cooperation between these two formerly opposing groups.
 The director also uses humor to break down some of the cultural differences between the two groups of Korean soldiers.  Portrayal of the Northern soldiers is one of respect, as they are given the voice of responsible Koreans, not simply the puppets of a unjust regime.  The director does not glorify the Southern soldiers either, which is speaks even more since this film was released to South Korean audiences, tackling nationalism head on.  Evidence of unity and mutual respect comes forth to defeat a common enemy in the end of the film. Overall this director turns his head on historical motives that have dominated ideologies of past films, instead wishing to supply his own advise on how to unify Korea.",1238976000,,1567,5.16600790513834
2524336,4,B000EN6N4A,"Heaven's Soldiers is a blend of colorful humor with an epic backdrop to create a film that seriously considers the problem of North and South reunification through the scope of the nationalist paradigm. The opening of the movie presents both North and South leaders cooperating to hand over a nuclear device to the Americans. However, an uncompromising North Korean military leader refuses to surrender their efforts and temporarily foils the negotiations between the two countries. In the midst of smuggling the nuclear device and with South Korean armies tailing the North Korean rebels, the movie takes a fantastical turn as they all time-travel to 1572. They are immediately thrown into the threat of Jurchen invasion upon the Korean peninsula. The two sides temporarily make amends to solve a greater crisis of finding the nuclear device and to return back to home.

 However, the movie takes an interesting turn when they run into the much heralded hero, Admiral Yi Sun-sin, who had yet to fulfill his destiny as a great military leader. Much to the surprise of the South Korean side, Yi Sun-sin is nothing but a lowly thief and has given up on the prospect of entering the military. This temporary humorous coincidence is marred by Jurchen aggression that threatens the North and South soldiers to either help the local Choson people or to return home. Ultimately, the soldiers decide to defend their minjok rather than to return home. This relates to Sin Chae-ho's elevation of the minjok above the boundaries of national borders. In this particular case, Yi Sun-sin is reinstated as the martial hero and the North and South soldiers unite to fight for their minjok. The director emphasizes the touching gesture of sacrificing in favor of a greater cause that transcends divided national values.",1238976000,,1803,5.0673400673400675
2524337,5,B000EN6N4A,"Heaven's Soldiers is a remarkable movie about reconciliation between North and South Korea. The film begins with the revelation that both countries have been working in concert to develop a nuclear weapon to protect both countries from foreign threats. It is decided that the nuke should be delivered to the Americans and the program dismantled to avoid inciting an invasion. In response, North Korean officer Kang Min Gil steals the weapon and South Korean Special Forces lead by Officer Park Jeong Woo are sent to retrieve the nuke. A firefight accidentally breaks out a comet transports Park and two of his soldiers as well as Kang and two of his soldiers, the nuke and the nuclear scientist back in time. The find themselves in the north eastern border lands of in Korean history where they meet the South Korean hero Admiral Yi Sun-Sin after he has failed his first attempt at the military exam. There is a significant amount of tension between the North and South Korean soldiers as the former attempt to locate the nuke and the latter try to convince the will be Admiral Yi, who is now a ginseng smuggler and thief, that he will be a great general and the salvation of Korea. The two factions insist on erecting barriers and divisions that Admiral Yi constantly breaks down and slowly interactions begin to bring the North and South Korean soldiers together, always with Admiral Yi as the catalyst for their interactions. Eventually, Yi and the soldiers decide to help a small village defeat a roving band of barbarians who are pillaging throughout the border lands. But, the soldiers then discover that in order to get back to their time they would have to abandon this village and the Admiral to their fate. One by one, each of the soldiers realizes that as Koreans there is much more that unites than divides them and that Korea as a whole, not just North of South, is worth laying down their lives for. The soldiers are all killed in a valiant battle against the overwhelming numbers of the barbarian hordes and at the end Admiral Yi stands alone as the victor symbolizing the perseverance and indefatigable spirit of Korea. Meanwhile, the scientist successfully returns the nuke to the present day and tells of the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers who stayed behind. The military officials hear the story but come to the conclusion that reconciliation is impossible... for now. But there is hope for the future.",1238976000,,2424,4.815347721822542
2524338,5,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" begins with footage of the meeting between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and Chairman Kim Jong Il of North Korea on June 13, 2000 which sets off the main theme of the film: the reunification of North and South Korea. This theme continues in the plot, which has North and South Korea working together to develop a nuclear bomb. When both Koreas decide to surrender the nuke to America, a group of North Korean soldiers take the nuke and the scientist who helped create it. In the middle of the fight between the North Korean soldiers and the South Korean soldiers sent to reclaim the weapon, a comet transports both parties back in time to the 16th century, a time before Korea was divided. Here the soldiers meet up with the South Korean nationalist hero, Yi Sun-sin, who is depicted as an ambitionless thief and smuggler. Though this version of General Yi is controversial, his character promotes the film's theme of reunification by breaking down barriers, literally and figuratively, between the North and South Koreans. Together, both sides work to train Yi so that he can fulfill his destiny of saving Korea.
The South Korean film makers' depiction of the North Korean soldiers also promotes the reunification theme. The North Korean soldiers are not demonized, nor are the South Korean soldiers glorified, both sides have flaws. Both sides are also willing to work together for the good of Korea as a whole. In doing this, the film makers present the idea that both the North and the South would value the peninsula as a whole above their individual countries. The film promotes reunification as a viable possibility for the fictional situation as well as Korea's real life situation.",1238976000,,1718,4.886986301369863
2524339,4,B000EN6N4A,"Heaven Soldiers begins with a scene where two Korean leaders fictionally form a secret alliance with the other and produce a weapon of mass destruction.  They agree to give the weapon to the United States, but the North Korean officer decides he has a different agenda and steals the warhead and the scientist who built it.  As they are trying to escape, they are transported back in time through a comet, where they discover themselves in the middle of 16th century Korea, a time period in Korean history where they were fighting off Barbarian and Chinese threats.  The group finds themselves in the middle of a battle with barbarian's and end up saving a group of farmers, and are labeled ""heaven soldiers.""  They eventually encounter the famous Korean general Yi Sun Sin, who is not as the legend suggests.  Yi is not the heroic legend he is in present day Korea, but is a poor thief and couldn't even pass the officers exam.  The group then makes it one of their goals to develop Yi into the great general they know that he is.  As the film progresses both officer Kang and officer Park and their soldiers become closer with one another and with Yi.  When the time comes for the soldiers to come back to real time they are faced with a choice to stay and fight with Yi or leave.  They decide to stay and fight, showing that the famous South Korean general is worth fighting and dying for even by North Korean soldiers.  Throughout the movie both the North Korean soldiers and South Korean soldiers make a dividing line and each time Yi is always pictured in the middle of the two countries and never on one side or the other.  The filmmakers intent for this is to show that both South Korea and North Korea could come together as one country by using the past as a stepping stone to unite the two countries and bring back old Korean unity and nationalism.  Using cultural heroes such as the famous general Yi shows that the film suggests using Korea's past could help reconcile the differences between the North and South.",1238976000,,2026,4.550964187327824
2524340,5,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" is a film aimed at uniting North and South Korea through nationalism. The film begins with a flashback to the meeting between two Koran leaders and is based on the premise that these two leaders shared a nuclear weapon that they intended to give to the United States. The North Korean Major Kang decides to hijack the weapon along with Dr. Kim, the female scientist who constructed it to prevent US control. A battle breaks out mid-theft and both North and South Korean soldiers are eclipsed in a comet that transports them back to the 16th century. The soldiers find themselves in 1572, just prior to Yi Sun Sin's rise to fame.
 As the soldiers try to figure out what has happened to them and where they are, they encounter Yi Sun Sin and are divided between those who view him as a national hero and those who discredit this claim. Throughout the film, viewers watch as Yi Sun Sin unknowingly mediates between North and South. Both physically and ideologically, Yi is consistently positioned between the two sides of modern day Korea. Viewers also watch as Yi transforms from a petty thief and smuggler into a great warrior. Initially, the North Korean soldiers felt justified in their disbelief of Yi but the film illustrates a transformation in the North Koreans that is clearly linked to Yi Sun Sin's personal transformation. As the soldier's time in the 16th century wears on, they figure out how to get back to the present day. All but the North Korean Major Kang decide to return to the modern time. Major Kang sees it as his duty to stay with Yi Sun Sin. Before the comet returns, all but Dr. Kim and the nuclear weapon remain to ensure the success of Yi Sun Sin. The uniting if the North and South is obvious and tantamount the to films nationalistic theme.",1238976000,,1787,4.6372239747634065
2524341,4,B000EN6N4A,"Heaven's Soldiers is a film concerned with Korea's nationalist history and the idea of reunification. One of the biggest disagreements between the North and South Korean soldiers is over Yi Sun-Sin, a 16th century general who fought the Japanese. Yi is a nationalist hero to the Southern soldiers, but the Northern Koreans barely know who he is. Their version of Korean history uses Kim Il-Sung not Yi Sun-Sin as a catalyst for nationalist pride. The story addresses this nationalist paradigm; Yi Sun-Sin has been chosen from history as a nationalist hero to fuel patriotism and pride in Korea. There is however a question of legitimacy: is Yi the hero the South thinks he is? For a majority of the film it is doubtful; he is an unmotivated ginseng smuggler who has no ambition to become a military leader. Like nationalist historians, the South Korean soldiers try to shape Yi Sun-Sin into the hero they need. In the end he fulfills expectations and the movie wants to prove that Yi is not a glorified creation; he is an actual Korean hero worthy of both North and South Korean admiration.
The theme of reunification is obvious, but not ridiculously hopeful. There is an emphasis on relationships between the North and South Korean soldiers who are forced to work together. The film argues for reunification of the Korean people on a personal level. The initial government alliance fails miserably while the North and South Korean soldiers create lasting personal bonds. They support Yi to unite against the barbarians and become both friends and comrades. Yi Sun-Sin is made to be an ideal, national figure who represents a unified Korea fighting against outside forces instead of one another.",1238976000,,1695,4.971830985915493
2524342,3,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" straddles the fine line between satire and critique as it takes the decades long standoff in Korea and twists it into an exploration of Korean nationalism with the help of some science fiction elements. Starting in the present day, two squads of Korean soldiers, one from the North, the other from the South, are transported back through time by a passing comet to the 16th century, a time of war and upheaval. There they encounter Yi sun-sin, the historic general who led the Koreans to victory during the bloody Imjin War and national hero to South Korea. Only now he is not a general yet and far from the patriotic, glorious hero that the South Koreans hold so highly. Through cooperation and understanding of each other, the soldiers must work to turn the formerly meek and petty Yi into the military leader that he was meant to be and to find a way back to their own time.
 Rather than addressing the issue directly, ""Heaven's Soldiers"" uses fiction and nationalist lore to explore the tension and sentimentality that defines the relationship between North and South and the struggle for Korean identity. Korean nationalist ideology permeates this film through historical reference and subtle direction. Throughout all the hardships the characters have to face being trapped in the past, Yi Sun-sin is the thin tether that keeps the two sides together. Though it initially plays out like a summer science fiction thriller, this film rings a message of hope that through a certain interpretation of history and circumstances, Korea can be both a united nation, finally free from foreign influence and truly independent. Very rarely can a film be nationalist without being propaganda, but ""Heaven's Soldiers"" manages to do that, exemplifying the skill and subtlety of Korean nationalist cinema.",1238457600,,1817,5.076923076923077
8111689,4,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's soldiers"" leaves viewers strongly convinced that North Koreans and South Koreans are one people, not two different countries separated by the 38th parallel. The main catalyst of brining these two nations together is the South Korean military hero: Yi Sun Shin.  In the movie, South Korea attempts to retrieve a nuke that North Korea steals away from them.  Through a comet, they somehow travel back in time to the late 16th century and meet admiral Yi, who at the time is merely a ginseng smuggler and a thief.  Throughout the movie, the North and South Korean forces constantly quarrel and distinguish themselves as their own distinct entity.  This happens quite often during the movie, when they set up an artificial border through a fence made out of twigs, or when the two generals from each North and South Korea get into a brawl.  But every time they would fight, General Yi Sun Shin would step in and either kick down the fence that separates the two, or stop the fight between the generals, symbolizing that North Korea and South Korea are one people.  In the end, we see a beautiful scene where both the North and South Korea collaborate and rise up together to defend against the attacks of the Northern nomads. The last scene of the movie is when Yi Sun Shin is going out to the Battle of Noryang and says a remarkable quote of how they shall fight to the end against the Japanese for all of their descendants.  This implies once again that North and South Korea are all of Yi's descendants whom he fought courageously to protect the nation of Korea.  It leaves the viewer even disappointed how the Korean nation can be split when the Korean ancestors have worked so hard to preserve the nation.  ""Heaven's Soldiers"" is therefore a cry for hope that North and South Korea may be united one day.",1239235200,,1815,4.646875
8111690,5,B000EN6N4A,"In ""Heaven's Soldiers"", director Joon-ki Min carefully puts together a film that showcases epic Chosen Korean history alongside the modern political tensions of the 20th and 21st centuries. All at the same time, Joon-ki has created an important message for his audience that slowly folds into view by the end of the film. The plot erupts from the very beginning, when Kang Min Gil of the North Korean military steals a nuclear weapon that both North and South Korea were working on. South Korean officer Park Jeong Woo is sent to chase down Kang's contingent, but both sides (along with a doctor that Kang abducted) are transported back to 1572 through a comet. In this new time setting, the North and South Koreans meet the legendary Yi Sun-Shin, who is currently in his less-than-humble beginnings after failing his military exam. While waiting for the second arrival of the comet to return to their own time, Park attempts to reform Yi from the ginseng-smuggling bum that he is into the great hero of legend. Ultimately, Kang joins Woo on this endeavor (although for different reasons) and they finally help form a Yi that is able to defend his village against the invading Jurchens.
 Joon-ki's most difficult task with this film is presenting his argument as clearly as possible to an audience with a wide range of emotions concerning the whole North-South issue. He chooses obvious figureheads to represent each side (Kang and Park) and paints them with a clich animosity against one another. For instance, the banter between the two sides almost always results in exchanges of  ""damn reactionaries"" or ""damn reds"". When the soldiers find Yi, Park immediately wants to correct soon-to-be war hero, but Kang and his men believe that Yi's entire story is a South Korean myth which functions as propaganda. In the end, however, Kang becomes even more passionate about Yi's success than Park, claiming he was the key in clearing up Korea's shameful past.
 Yi Sun-Shin is portrayed as the mechanism that brings together the North and South against the Jurchens. He does this in the long run by making them set aside their differences to fight the invading barbarian hordes. He also literally eliminates whatever walls that they have made between themselves when he eliminates the soldiers' border marking line at his house. Thus, director Joon-ki Min wants his audience to see how the common past heals these modern barriers and makes the contemporary problems seem almost trivial when placed next to the trials faced by Yi in the 16th century. Thus, Joon-ki Min's film successfully engages the audience into thinking for themselves about the issue of reconciliation between North and South Korea.",1239235200,,2697,5.015625
8111691,5,B000EN6N4A,"From director Min Jun Gi, comes the 2005 film Heaven's Soldiers with a nationalistic and military themed filled with equal parts of action and comedy. The film revolves around a group of South and North Korean soldiers who make an unexpected trip to the past where they meet the legendary General Yi Soon-Shin who fought of the Japanese invaders during the Imjin wars. Concurrently, their countries are in feud with the United States because they pressured the Koreas in surrendering the nuclear warhead that they mutually developed. The film demonstrates the distortion of modern Korea's history and uses its past to rediscover its true Korean identity. The filmmaker uses nationalism and symbolism to inspire Koreans by giving them a broad sense of using their past as a bridge that Korea was once one nation and conveying its message. It demonstrates Korea's lost martial spirit and identity as one nation rather two separate ones. In this film, nationalism is explored as rather presenting North Korea in a sympathetic light as a sibling and by portraying other powers such as Japan, China, and the United States as external enemies that threatens the nations identity and independence. The film demonstrates the importance of the attitude that Koreans have and should have towards in seeking to sustain their national identity. It conveys nationalist symbolism through General Yi Soon-Shin through his words and actions, such as the scenes where he breaks a fight between the North and South Korean majors, knocks down the stick fence, the historical meeting of the Korean leaders, and much more. The filmmaker also shows shadow and substance through humor by showing the obstacles one must face and the unity of Korea in fighting the external enemies. Full of nationalistic pride, this movie takes you on an adventure and simultaneously giving you a sense of Korean nationalism based on modern history of Korea.",1239235200,,1917,5.147435897435898
8111692,4,B000EN6N4A,"Heaven's Soldiers, by Min Joon-Ki, represents the relationship between North and South Korea, and then tries to find unity between the two divided nations.  The film makes numerous comedic jabs at the nationalist paradigm in both countries. For the South, they portray the national hero general Yi Soon-Sin as a smuggler and a thief. They also ridicule N. Korean propaganda by saying only an idiot would believe that Kim Il-Sung made grenades out of pine cones in his fight against the Japanese.
The story starts off with N. and S. Korean soldiers being time travelled back in time due to a celestial phenomenon. They are forced to work together to survive and return back to the future. The director puts in numerous hilarious references of Korea using this scenario. For example, a Republic of Korea sergeant tries to steal some artifacts so he can sell it off when he returns to the future, which represents the capitalistic nature of S. Korea. On the other hand, we see a N. Korean sergeant trying to hog all the food, representing the food shortage of N. Korea. N. and S. Koreans are constantly criticizing each other for their actions and Yi Soon-Sin comes to reconcile their differences and destroy the barrier between two sides. One of the aims of this film is for the viewers to reflect on the national paradigm that surrounds both nations and criticize ourselves for believing into the misleading reality that were created by nationalists of both North and South Korea.",1239148800,2,1479,4.869047619047619

Opening the film on the historic meeting between the North and South backs this idea, while simultaneously laying the foundation for the film.

However, upon facing one of many foreign intrusions, it is the decided that they must surrender their armaments. North Korean Major Kang, disagrees with these sentiments, and steals the bomb. South Korean Special Forces attempt to capture Major Kang when a comet passes through the sky, sending North and South Koreans alike, along with the nuke, back to the year 1572.
 The comet throws the small band of ""Heavenly Soldiers"" among a battle between poor Korean peasants and a foreign invading force, the Jurchen - who also come into possession of the nuclear bomb swept up by the comet. After gathering together and seeking shelter, the group bunkers down for the night in a cave. During the night, South Korean nationalist hero, Admiral Yi Sun Sin, robs the band of soldiers. Upon learning the identity of the thief, the South Koreans immediately revere this historic figure. Even the North Korean soldiers grow to respect this important person associated with the Korean identity. Through comedic exploits, the film humanizes the great Admiral Yi and the North and South soldiers. However, the film quickly takes on a much more serious tone.

Called ""Heaven's Soldiers"" because of their futuristic looks and advanced weapons, they make it their task to find the nuclear weapon that went missing when they were transported to the past and to train Yi Sun-Sin to pass his military exam.  The soldiers then join forces with Yi Sun-Sin and the Korean villagers to battle the barbarians who want them all dead!
Set against the backdrop of a North and South Korean alliance to build a nuclear weapon in the 2000s, the film resonates with the idea that the two sides can cooperate with each other. The footage of the 2000 meeting between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il, the fictional alliance between North and South Korea to build a nuclear weapon, and the relationships and bonds created between the North and South Korean soldiers while trying to survive in 1572 are all examples of how ""Heaven's Soldiers"" presents the idea of Korean nationalism and reunification between the two sides.  Throughout ""Heaven's Soldiers"", Yi Sun-Sin is always between the North and South Korean soldiers, unknowingly reminding them, and the audience, that once upon a time, Korea was not divided.",1239062400,,1581,5.12015503875969

In retaliation, South Korea sends officers of their own to retrieve the nuke.  While the two sides engage in battle, a comet comes along, transporting the soldiers back through time.

The movie takes another unexpected turn as they run into the real life hero, Admiral Yi Sun Sin, but is baffled when they realize he is not the honorable hero that legend holds.  Rather, he is merely a thief who couldn't even pass the military exam.  The story centers around the soldiers uniting to help Yi meet his fate as the great military hero that he is to become, while at the same time Yi helps to mediate and reconcile relations between the opposing soldiers.  The film's underlying theme is unification, which is achieved between the two groups of soldiers as they learn about one another on a personal level, realizing that both sides are human and that they share a common bond as fellow countrymen.",1239062400,,1734,5.095406360424028
8111696,4,B000EN6N4A,"Directed by Min Joon-Ki, Heaven's Soldiers uses a magical comet to transport three Peoples Republic of Korea soldiers, three Republic of Korea soldiers, a nuclear scientist, and one nuclear bomb back to 16th century Korea, a dangerous time when Korea faced invading barbarians from the north while the bureaucratic elite Yangban do little to protect the peasants. The soldiers are forced to face the ideological values they hold dear when they find the legendary Korean general Yi Su-Shin, who will protect Korea from the invading Japanese in 1592. To the chagrin of the South Koreans, Yi Su-Shin is not the famous warrior, but a thief who doesn't want anything to do with the military. South Korean Navy Officer Park Jeong Woo tries to instill in Yi the will to defend the nation through military training, but is unsuccessful until Yi is captured by barbarians. After Yi and the bomb are rescued from the barbarians, Yi and the Korean soldiers unite to defend the village from the invading Jurgen horde. Film director Min's tale of nationalist struggle shows how Korea can unite to defend itself against outside attack while casting aside North-South differences for Korean connections. The Yi Su-Shin character also challenges the Koreans by asking why they fight and challenging their North or South nationalist symbols in favor of Korean symbols.",1239062400,,1351,5.117647058823529
8111697,4,B000EN6N4A,"The film Heaven's Soldier, by Min Joon-Ki, starts off in a meeting between North and South Korea where they secretly formed an alliance to co-produce a nuclear bomb. However, as the United States figure this out they are forced to hand over the bomb, but a North Korean officer, Kang Min Gil, takes matters into his own hand and steals the bomb for North Korea. As a result South Korea dispatches one of their military officer, Park Jeong Woo, to retrieve the explosive back. As one party encounters another, a comet that takes people back into time arrives and it takes the officers, their soldiers, and a woman scientist back into time to 1572.

While this film may have humor there is a serious underlying message the director is trying to get across throughout the whole film. The director, who is in favor of reunification of North and South Korea, makes an attempt of showing how North and South Koreans are the same people. He does this by sending the two generals back into time to 1572 where Koreans faced a common enemy at the time called Jurchens, or barbarians, in their northern frontier. Through this journey the two generals come across Yi Sun Sin, a South Korean national hero and Sin eventually bridges the gap between the two soldiers as they fight off the Jurchens. At first the director makes the comparison of Yi Sun Sin and Kim Il Sung by poking fun of all the mystical legends that surrounds these so called legendary figures. The North Koreans cannot see what is why Yi Sun Sin is so great and the South Koreans feel the same about Kim Il Sung. However, because they are faced with one common opposing force, the Jurchens, they are forced to work together and as the film progresses they forget all their differences and eventually they are even willing to die for one another. Thus the filmmaker gets his idea across that the North and South Koreans are the same people and we can see that through history. The director tries to show that the division of the two countries is a fairly recent event and throughout history Korea has been one nation.

 Of course being a South Korean film there is a nationalistic tendency to use Yi Sun Sin as the main hero even though they poke fun of him at the beginning of the movie. Sin is used in the film to bridge the gap between the two parties since he cannot figure out why the Heaven's Soldiers are fighting one another. The director uses visual representation to show this as he literally puts Sin in the middle of the two parties in almost every scene. Sin ultimately becomes the general the South Koreans knows him as, since the movie ends with him fighting the Japanese with his turtle ships.",1239062400,,2664,4.569037656903766
8111698,4,B000EN6N4A,"""Heaven's Soldiers"" is a fictional film that appears to be a comedic action flick on the surface with an underlying message about Korean unification. In the film, South Korea and North Korea develop a nuclear weapon together. The North Korean major Kang Min Gil steals the nuke  and a Korean scientist and makes an escape by sea. South Korean soldier Park Jeong Woo and his men are sent to recover the nuke. While the North Korean and South Korean soldiers engage in an intense gunfight, a comet passes overhead, transporting the soldiers to 1572 Korea. They are dropped in the norther frontier part of Korea where the threat of Jurchen invasion is part of daily life. The soldiers choose to work together and switch their focus to just getting back home. The soldiers meet a young Yi Sun Sin, the highly-regarded Korean admiral who will defeat Japan in the Imjin Wars. The soldiers learn that Yi Sun Sin is a lowly thief who is far from the great admiral he will become. The soldiers make it their mission to train Yi Sun Sin into the great military leader he is meant to be and help him defeat the Jurchen threat.

Korean unification is the underlying theme of the film. This is emphasized through the relationship between the North and South Korean soldiers and their united efforts in supporting Yi Sun Sin. The fact that history shows that Koreans can put their country above an outside force supports this theme of unification. Even though the stolen nuke implies the flaws of political unification, the bond the soldiers form shows how Korean unification is possible at the human and personal level.",1239062400,,1606,4.752688172043011
