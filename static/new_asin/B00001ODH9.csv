7914632,3,B00001ODH9,"I remember seeing ""Dentist in the Chair"" in 1960 when I was a kid. I have always been a big fan of British comedy films, but ""Dentist"" is hardly a classic. At the same time it has a cast of likeable actors, and it is still a pleasant way of spending 80 minutes.

With the success of the British ""Doctor"" comedies, I suppose it was inevitable that the subject of dental students would also be turned into an amusing film. In fact, there was a sequel to this title, ""Dentist on the Job"". Since Amazon has already provided a plot synopsis, I don't think I need to repeat the plot-line.

British comedian, Bob Monkhouse, is the leading man here ( he was to become a British television icon for decades ), with Peggy Cummins as the woman he falls for. There is the usual cast of British actors in support--people like Eric Barker and Reginald Beckwith who could play roles like this in their sleep. Finally we have Kenneth Connor, most famous to North American audiences as a ""Carry On Gang"" regular. As the incompetent burglar who causes all the trouble at the dental school, Mr. Connor is a born scene-stealer and he generates most of the chuckles in the film.

The DVD is full-screen, black and white, mono sound and I had no problems with the quality. Extras are sparse--a trailer and some stills from the film--and the packaging is very rudimentary. This gives rise to the question--why is this disc so expensive ? I could certainly understand a person who is interested in this movie, waiting for a cheaper, second-hand copy.

Bottom line--a pleasant but unexceptional British comedy that has a few amusing sequences. There is nothing ""amusing"" about the price of the disc though.",1189728000,2,1681,4.64983164983165
7914633,2,B00001ODH9,"This is a fantastic and mildly amusing movie. Peggy Cummins, Bob Monkhouse and Kenneth Connor do their best but it just can't quite turn out the laughs intended. Director Don Chaffey did the best with what material he had. Perhaps they should have asked if there was a good screenwriter in the house.",1149120000,,300,4.679245283018868
7914634,1,B00001ODH9,"This was to be the first of a series of comedies cued to the enormous success of, and utilizing many of the same players from, England's ""Carry On"" comedies. Only two were made, and this one demonstrates the principal shortcoming leading to the series' end. Despite the presence of an attractive cast, and the same frantic pace which commanded audience approval for the ""Carry On"" films, ""Dentist in the Chair"" is betrayed by an extraordinarily inane script.",1106006400,,458,4.961038961038961
