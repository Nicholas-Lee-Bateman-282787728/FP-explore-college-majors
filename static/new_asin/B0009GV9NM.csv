They are excellent musicians, and they had a signature sound. Might only be for Sky fans, or for those who lean toward a more ""classical"" progressive rock proclivity.",1430870400,,384,4.422535211267606

8060366,5,B0009GV9NM,"This concert is pure gold dust. To have the original members of Sky playing together like this is something I never thought I would see. This band were so musically gifted and so tight together. I cannot give enough plaudits to Sky.
One complaint. The concert is only 60 minutes. They barely get warmed up. But the music is superb.",1317168000,,331,4.533333333333333
8060367,4,B0009GV9NM,Siepi has long been my favourite bass and Freni one of my favourite sopranos. There is a little irony in this performance insofar as Freni was married to rival bass Ghiaurov. Nonetheless this is a nice performance . Freni is her charming self and in good vocal form. Siepi sings some rather rare but non challenging arias but as he was in the latter stages of his career this is understandable. One can still sense the immense musicality and interpretive intelligence through all of this. Over all this is a worth while item for any opera fan's collection,1221868800,2,555,4.673469387755102
8060368,2,B0009GV9NM,"THIS DVD IS ONLY 30 MINUTES LONG.

This DVD is taken from a German TV performance in 1980.  It is like many poorly filmed and produced European rock shows from that period. Production values were improving in the US at that time, but it seems Europe hadn't quite caught up yet.

The group is crowded on to a cramped stage and all the members are very stationary.  The filming is terrible.  The wrong members of the group are in focus at the wrong time.  A guitar solo is going on, and the keyboardist is the only one who can be seen.  It is like the video and the audio do not match at all.  It appears as if some video was taken of the band at a different time and then poorly matched up to the audio.

The video quality is poor.  The camera angles are terrible.  You rarely get see a member playing.  It is mostly side views and backs of the heads.

The sound quality is mediocre to poor.

Those are the facts about the DVD.  What about my opinion on the music?  I am a great fan of Francis Monkman and I like many of the other groups the other musicians had been in.  I liked the first Sky album.  But, I found Sky 2 a little boring.

The music on this DVD is more along the lines of Sky 2.  The musicians are great, and there is some complex playing.  But, I found the compositions uninspired and uninteresting.

This was part of the second wave of British Progressive Rock.  I like to call it British Progressive Jazz, as most of the groups playing with a jazz influence.  I found groups like Sky and Happy the Man could get tedious after a while, even though the bands had great musicians.

If you like Francis Monkman, you might want to check out his CD called Jam.  That is one interesting, energetic CD, but may be a little to metal for some.",1166400000,6,1751,4.183183183183183
8060369,5,B0009GV9NM,"This concert DVD is a must-have if you love the music of SKY.  Of course, lots of fabulous pieces did not make it to the BREMEN concert (at that date, SKY's only releases where SKY-1 and SKY-2).  Sahara, Tocatta and Fugue, and many others would have been incredible to watch.

Anyway, performance is SUPERB, music is FANTASTIC, these rare musicians are OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD.  Starting with classic-guitar virtuoso John Williams (impressive performance of an Andres Segovia's disciple),  incredible keyboardist Francis Monkman (unique harpsichord and mastering use of synthesizers), Kevin Peek's fabulous electric guitar which matches Williams' incredibly, Herbie Flowers' one-of-a-kind basses, and Tristan Fry's extensive and rich and brightly executed percussions.

It's a 1 hour DVD concert you will enjoy from start to finish; and at the end, thriving for more.

Why isn't SKY a well known progressive-classic-rock band ?  No one could say.  To me, it has been the BEST OF THE BEST of all times in this genre and inspiration of many other great bands (i.e. Mannheim Steamroller's Fresh Aire).

Hope there were more SKY concerts available on DVD !",1160524800,6,1146,5.316666666666666
8060370,5,B0009GV9NM,"If you know of the band you will want this piece. The classic line up live in a small club/studio setting. They don't look cool but the music is unique and well executed. The picture and sound are sharp and clear. The camera angles are ""okay"", not real dynamic, but do not detract like many of todays ""quick jump"" productions. It's just so rare to see a group like this at all...gotta be 5 stars.",1145577600,4,396,4.293333333333333
8060371,1,B0009GV9NM,"Unfortuneatly,I cannot review the content of this concert as I received 2 flawed DVD discs; neither would play in several new DVD machines;  the first disc did not fit properly and appeared warped; the 2nd disc would not load properly and had a malformed edge.  I would defintely like to have a working disc as Bergonzi has always been a favorite.  The score of one does not reflect the content; just the fact that the discs received would not play.",1122422400,9,449,4.5875
