8321185,2,B001MEJYAA,This DVD did not have the greatest games on it as it tries to advertise by its title. It wasn't worth the money.,1357862400,,112,3.9130434782608696
8321186,5,B001MEJYAA,"I consider this a great dvd of several Kansas Jayhawk basketball games. It is fantastic seeing the players and coaches that brought KU the last couple of national championships. How about a dvd of some KU games from the 50s, 60s, & 70s? Wilt, JoJo, Dave Robisch. That would really be something.",1278892800,4,294,4.673076923076923
