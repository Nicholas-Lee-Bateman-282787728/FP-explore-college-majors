8541943,5,B009INAHN0,"I saw this on clearance at my local video store.  Just to be clear, I don't like watching loads of gore and tend to steer away from stuff like ""Saw"" and similar fare.  However, I do enjoy a good animal attack show.  So, I went back and forth for a while on whether or not to buy this, as I didn't want anything too horrific.  But, it was cheap so I took a chance figuring I could always sell it if it wasn't what I expected.  However, this show fit the bill perfectly and is now a prized part of my DVD collection.  Most of the stories take place in Australia and involve shark or crocodile attacks.  There was one snake story.  The re-creations are very well done and appear quite realistic without going overboard on the gore factor.  While it does sadden me that these are true stories with real victims, it is still a very good show.  If you find animal attack stories the least bit interesting, watch this show.  It's extremely well done and horrifying/fascinating all at the same time.",1370217600,6,991,4.360655737704918
