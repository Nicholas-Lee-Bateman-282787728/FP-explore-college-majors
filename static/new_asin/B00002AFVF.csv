7915452,4,B00002AFVF,"Blondie Takes a Vacation

The film begins with a scene of a big fire. The Bumsteads prepare to go on vacation. (People were free to pin a notice on their front door!) ""Won't you ever grow up?"" Alvin uses big words and gives advice. Can they take Daisy? We get to see people traveling on a Pullman coach. The conversations tell about life in those days. What if they can't get a cabin by the shore? Is there another place with electricity? [Could anyone quickly ignite a pile of wood with one match?] Is there something scary going on? The owners of the small hotel have a loan coming due. Will Blondie help that old couple? ""Nothing is impossible.""

Uncle Jonathan ran away from home. Dagwood fixes things. Are those people guests or bill collectors? Will Baby Dumpling find a nice kitty? Will new visitors come to the Westview Inn? Will an accident cause a fire? [There are conflicts beneath the veneer of comedy.] Will Baby Dumpling save Dagwood and the hotel for a happy ending? [Is it believable?]
Note how this comedy covers over serious problems.",1241740800,,1052,4.620320855614973

It is a must have!",1053043200,2,279,4.490196078431373
7915454,5,B00002AFVF,"This film, third in the Blondie series, takes a refreshing change of pace. The Bumsteads (Penny Singleton, Arthur Lake) finally get to take a two-week vacation. The vacation isn't exactly trouble-free though. There is much concern for Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms). This film makes a dramatic turn when Baby Dumpling gets caught inside a hotel on fire. The next film in the series is BLONDIE BRINGS UP BABY.",1040256000,,405,4.970588235294118
