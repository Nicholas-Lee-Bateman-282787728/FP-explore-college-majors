2827895,4,B000PSJDS2,"In a devastated world overrun by monstrous bugs and outlaws, Honoka is the protector of the innocent. She has a 6th sense for danger, sword skills that rock, and an A.I. tank that acts as her partner and home. She is ready to take on any job that her clients are willing to pay her for. While crossing the desert, she finds a man wandering alone. This man has a secret, and a mission that will change her life forever. Her skills are about to be tested like never before.

This anime is a lot better than I expected. I has good animation, voice acting, a unique story, and a pretty good soundtrack. There is a lot of action, drama, mystery, adventure, and some pretty interesting characters & plot twists. There isn't another anime out there that I can really compare this to. It's pretty original, despite that, I still found it lacking a little something that would make it a 5 star show. It's hard to put my finger on what it is, but The Third is comes just shy of being incredible. Even so, it's still really good, and definitely worth watching. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1353974400,3,1082,4.383084577114428
2827896,5,B000PSJDS2,"It is true this anime does not come from one of the big budget anime companies, however they still manage to create some excellent mesmerizing sequences (and this is definitely some of the best integration of drawn and CGI animation I have seen ever). The story is very good although like a lot of anime it is a bit vague but if you do not need everything spelled out for you it has a good story and they provide enough details to not be left scratching your head. I think they left the door open for a continuation and I certainly hope so. Despite the mentioned drawbacks the whole package is very good. I do not like animes which are too silly and this one does not have the hyper annoying dumbnut but still has a lot of comical relief and it also gets philosophical but does not get preachy. Basically if you like a good story and do not mind some minor drawbacks and do not need you anime to be all about peeking under girls dresses or weird antropomorphic dudes fighting and talking nonsense for 15 minutes before each punch you will like this.",1230076800,,1049,4.357142857142857
2827897,5,B000PSJDS2,"I've been collecting anime for the past 3-4 years.  I love anime and I recently purchased and watched vol. 1 of ""The Third: The Girl with the Blue Eye"".  This show became my 49th anime show in my whole anime collection.  The night I got it I was so happy becuase not only did I get to see ""The Third"", but I got my 50th anime show as well.  I kept thinking what a blessing it was to have seen and encountered such great anime.  Now owning 50 plus shows I can happily say that I've never once picked a show that I have regreted.  From Dragonball GT being my 1st show to Full Metal Panic being my 58th show I'm very proud to have ""The Third"" into my mix of anime shows.  I liked the first volume a lot.  I really enjoyed how the anime was presented as if it was a story.  The music was great and it really fit the incredible scenes in the show.  The writers really know how to write.  Get ""The Third"".  I promise, you won't regret it.  I never give up on anime.  If I start a new show, I watch it till the end.  Anime is my passion and I will continue to collect more and more.",1188864000,2,1075,3.9348837209302325
2827898,3,B000PSJDS2,"First off, let me say that unlike most reviewers, I rate shows very critically, and 3 stars is a reasonably decent show by my standards. The trailer for this which I saw on another anime DVD (Haruhi) looked reasonably impressive, and I knew that regardless of whether or not the show lived up to the promise of the trailer, I wouldn't regret my purchase because the trailer song was extremely good so at the very least I would get to hear the good song again.

The show itself fell short of what the trailer showed by a moderate amount, but the music didn't. The song turned out to be the opening song, but it's composed by the same person who did all the BGM for the show, therefore all the other songs are good too. The opening animation itself was extremely unimpressive, mostly still pictures with no animation, unfortunately. The show itself has quite high-quality animation though, so I guess in this case the creators chose to spend all their budget on the show itself rather than using some of it for a flashy opening.

Here are my ratings for the show, split into categories:

Directing: 3 of 5 stars. It's a strange directing style, neither exceptionally good nor bad. It's the same style that a number of recent Japanese feudal-era live-action samurai shows are done in, which is pretty funny since this the story and setting of The Third couldn't be more different. This can be easily noticed when the ""narrator"" speaks and tells what the main girl is thinking. A lot of samurai dramas do this, with the exact same kind of voice. It's pretty hilarious. I bet most people haven't seen too many recent samurai shows though so they won't know what I mean, oh well.
Story: 2 of 5 stars. Doesn't seem interesting to me, but I personally don't care about story when I watch a show anyway. I've only seen the first 4 episodes so maybe it will get more interesting later on, but usually a good story will engage the viewer from the get-go.
Drawing style: 3 of 5 stars. Nothing special. Fairly typical anime-style. Fairly mundane character designs, though I like the kind of simple plain clothing that the main girl wears.
Drawing quality: 2 of 5 stars. Fairly inconsistent and in some episodes the drawings are pretty bad. What's worse is that the 2nd music video on this DVD contained clips from episodes on the next DVD and I could see that the drawings were REALLY degenerated in those.
Animation quality: 4 of 5 stars. Pretty impressive. It's obvious they DON'T have a big budget though, so they have to use the high-quality motion/fighting scenes sparingly and even when they do, I can see that more frames would have helped some of them be even better than they already were. But the people who animated this show have an excellent sense and knowhow to create visually impressive animated motions. This show is very well animated, coming from someone who considers this one of the most vital criteria of a good anime.
Music: 4 of 5 stars. Very impressive. I've never heard this anime composer before either, so a fresh and new skilled composer is always a good thing. The ending song is composed by someone else though and is awful.

One interesting comment to make is that I think this show makes exceptionally good use of 3D CGI effects. They don't overuse it like some other anime shows do (such as most Gonzo-produced titles) and they only use it for certain specific things, which is good. And they make sure that it blends into the 2D animation reasonably well. The sand in particular is really well done. A few of the scenes with the CGI tank may look a bit too CGI for my tastes, but for some reason I still find even the tank graphics to be anime-ish enough not to trigger the revolting feeling I get with most Gonzo-produced anime.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be buying Volume 2 of this when it comes out, but we'll see. This title retails for cheaper than normal ($25 instead of $30) but in the stores the actual price of this title is about the same as normal ($18 to $20). If I had more money or if I can find this for $15, I'd continue to buy, but this title is probably only 5th or lower on my list of anime titles that I actively purchase so I can't afford it. :)",1185753600,14,4196,4.515789473684211
2827899,4,B000PSJDS2,"The reviewer before me might be biased but he's not far off. I thought the series was first and foremost intriguing. The animation was solid and the action was pretty good. After the first episode the amount of action goes down a bit but as Ive seen in any anime, that always seems to happen. Characterwise I was left wanting a litte more. Outside of Bogie the AI Tank who I thought broke the mold and had a defining character, the other characters I felt could have been less vague. However I think they will get deeper into the characters next volume and I'm sure they will become more defined and likable. The world of The 3rd is very interesting and they give you just enough to keep you going, wondering who or what they are talking about without making you frustrated not fully knowing whats going on. With the exception of the 2nd episode, this volume moved pretty well with the action and intrigue of the whole storyline and like I said above Bogie is a great character; fun, funny, and canTANKerous. The mecha is interesting as well (specifically the main characters suit) and I think is actually the closest thing Ive seen to actually becoming a reality in my lifetime. (if I live to 100 and hopefully I do) The ending of episode 4 broadens the story even more and in doing so I will rent the next volume.",1185580800,7,1315,4.460580912863071

8193104,5,B000PSJDS2,"I love the Tank and his mannerism. I think it has a petty good story and well done graphics. No sex or fan far (which is good). The main girl just has a lot of good character and wants to do what is right. Call me naive or a romantic but I like that in a story. Cool battles and giant insects, best of all she fights with a Katona to help bring the world peace.",1376524800,,361,3.763157894736842
