257392,1,6300215628,"This is one of those films that are made to capitalize on star power, get quick results at the box office, and then disappear into the land of forgotten films.
About a half hour into this debacle, which featured whiny children, predictable plotting, and overall lack of likable (or believable) characters, I was forced to just turn it off.",1047427200,9,339,4.762711864406779
257393,2,6300215628,"Cary Grant and Sophia Loren performed their parts flawlessly. The plot, the props, the music, the lines were hopeless. Are we supposed to believe a foreign service officer would take his small children to a symphony concert? That the grown daughter of a world  class conductor would sing the Bing-Bang-Bong song during the orchestra's performance? or any other time, for that matter? That Sophia professionally repaired and painted that houseboat all by herself in a couple of days while Cary was at the office? That a pitcher of water would be handy on the table on the porch just when necessary to use it to illustrate a moral principle? I'm not incapable of suspending belief, if only there's compensation for it. I only watched to the end because I was making out with my girlfriend during the movie. I'd have been better off watching ""Godzilla 1985"".",1044489600,6,855,4.8561643835616435
257394,5,6300215628,"Houseboat takes me back to the old days of glorious movie entertainment. Sofia Loren and Cary Grant are such an unlikely pair, yet they strike sparks on the screen. Add delightful children and a luscious setting, and you have a movie you can watch with the entire family. A romance that makes you smile.",1042588800,8,303,4.62962962962963
257395,4,6300215628,"'Houseboat' is a throwback to the kind of sweet, happy comedies Cary Grant did in the late '40s-early '50s, and it foreshadows the domestic comedies James Stewart and Henry Fonda would do in the sixties. Granted, there is more romance (and with Sophia Loren as the objection of affection, Cary has it all OVER Jimmy and Hank!) but ultimately, it scores as a terrific family movie, as Loren, playing an inept but adorable housekeeper/nanny, wins the affection of widower Grant's kids, and awakens in him a more complete love than he was experiencing with his society girlfriend (played effectively by the beautiful Martha Hyer).
Living in a rundown houseboat to save on expenses, Grant and family lives had become a boring routine, until the arrival of Hurricane Loren, with her Italian philosophy, her singing, and her unmistakable femininity and sex appeal (which introduces oldest son Paul Peterson to the joys of puberty, and to daughter Mimi Gibson and younger son Charles Herbert a mother-figure they both needed). Grant is at first oblivious to her charms, but she is hard to ignore for long! The question then becomes, when will Cary 'wake up', and realize everything he needs is right on the houseboat?
Filmed after Grant and Loren's whirlwind affair during the filming of 'The Pride and the Passion', the film was a bittersweet experience for both stars, particularly shooting the wedding scene, as Grant still desperately wanted to marry Loren, but she had already decided to remain with longtime love Carlo Ponti. Viewers aware of the 'behind-the-scenes' story will appreciate the performances of the two leads even more!
After you watch 'Houseboat', catch the flipside of this story in Grant's later 'Father Goose', as a drunken reprobate with a boat who must deal with governess Leslie Caron and her charges! The two films make a fascinating double-feature, and showcases Cary Grant's amazing versatility!
Seen either way, 'Houseboat' is a delight!",1037145600,70,1961,5.13125
257396,5,6300215628,"Sophia Loren and Cary Grant team up in this hysterical movie. He's a widower with three children and his widow's sister after him (since she was four years old). Sophia is the daughter of a rich Italian Band conductor - she runs away because she's tired of being told what to do - and becomes the nanny for Grant. The only problem is she can't cook or clean. But the children love her. And soon Grant does too. Two things I learned from this movie: Never park your house on the railroad tracks, and always tie your house tightly to the dock.",988848000,,541,4.313725490196078
257397,4,6300215628,Grant and Loren are terrific together.  It was during the making of this film that Cary Grant fell hopelessly with Sofia Loren.  Grant is his usual charming self and he pours on the charm for her...and us.  This is a  must-have for Cary Grant film collectors.

257448,3,6300215628,"Sophia Loren is fun to watch, and the child actors are really very good, but the story doesn't hang together well. Where there should be tension, there isn't, and it's jarring that Cary Grant's character resists Sophia Loren's charm for 9/10 of the movie, and then he suddenly switches to deciding to marry her. The plot has the kids switch from feeling betrayed to supporting their wedding with no apparent reason to change their mind. Not a lot of story line support for what happens, but it gets a bonus for being a period movie with classic actors and all the fun of vintage sets and mores.",1509926400,,594,4.5607476635514015

257506,5,6300215628,"There aren't too many roles in which I find Cary Grant disagreeable, but this is one of them. Of course, since it's Cary Grant, I stayed vexed only so long before he eventually won me over with his dang charm. He plays a harried father who tries hard to care for his three unhappy children, only, he's appallingly rusty when it comes to parenting. See, he'd been neglectful of his young brood, so work-obssessed he'd allowed the ex-wife to be the primary custodian. When the ex passes away, Tom Winters chooses to take responsibility for his two boys and little girl, never mind that they'd rather stay with their grandparents. He whisks them away, anyway.

The plot synopsis to Houseboat goes like so: ""A lawyer with three children lives on a houseboat with an Italian symphony conductor's daughter as his maid."" No, Mr. Winters never intended for them to inhabit a creaky houseboat. It just worked out that way. Initially, he sets himself and the kids up in a cramped apartment in Washington, DC. Of course, the kids detest their new digs.

Sophia Loren plays 22-year-old Cinzia Zaccardi, feisty socialite and spoiled daughter of a celebrated symphony conductor. Cinzia can't cook or wash or sew or dust. She is, instead, posh and cultured, having attended the best schools in Switzerland. Cinzia has accompanied her father (Eduardo Ciannelli) for his orchestra's American tour. But she's fed up with being on display all the time, having to behave all the time. She's bored out of her gourd and restless. One evening, during the Washington, D.C. leg of the tour, she slips away into the night seeking to experience proper American nightlife. She creeps into a rowboat and promptly bumps into a runaway child and his harmonica.

You can't blame the kid for being smitten. He follows Cinzia to a street carnival, and she's swell enough of a dame that she dances with the little fella. And, a bit later, she even takes him home to his worried father. Who, you guessed it, is Tom Winters.

It's a long-about way of telling you how Cinzia met Mr. Winters. Note that, at this stage, Cinzia looks far from kempt, what with having reveled and cavorted most of the evening. So maybe you shouldn't condemn the man for thinking she's this poor immigrant girl, especially since she spins a yarn about being a G.I. bride, well, almost a G.I. bride, except the G.I. didn't marry her and so she had to go look for work... What with his youngest having taken a shine to her, what else can Mr. Winters, who tops his children's sh-- list, do but offer her a job as a live-in housekeeper?

And then this and that happens - much of it amusing - and they all end up living on a creaky houseboat.

So, the kids. The oldest, 13-year-old David, is a surly, aspiring kleptomaniac. The daughter is frightened of storms and, as it turns out, only wants for her father to comfort her and reassure her. The youngest, as you know, is a runaway.

1958's Houseboat was a huge success despite the crazy behind-the-scenes soap opera stuff going on. Reportedly, Cary Grant was mightily crushing on Sophia Loren, but his romantic advances were met with a resounding ""meh"" from Loren (who was already involved with another older gent). Further fueling the melodrama, this was supposed to be the third vehicle to co-star Grant and his then wife Betsy Drake (who also wrote the screenplay), except Grant supposedly finagled to replace her with Loren. To compound the insult, Betsy's screenplay was almost entirely retooled by screenwriters Melville Shavelson (who also directed) and Jack Rose, and Betsy got no writing credit. Moreoever, the new script received an Oscar nod for Best Original Story and Screenplay. I feel ya, Betsy.

Onscreen, Grant and Loren generate fantastic chemistry. Yes, Grant spends much of the movie being this oblivious, distracted dad, but his comic timing remains impeccable, and I just couldn't stay grouchy at him, never mind that I knew where the kids were coming from. The revelation to me was Loren's superb knack for comedy. I'd never seen her so accessible without sacrificing her va-va-voomness, her image of the earthy sex goddess. Each time I watch this movie, I fall in love with her all over again as she croons the fabulous ""Almost In Your Arms,"" but in Italian. It's a song that got the Oscar nod, as well, for Best Original Song. But at least Betsy Drake didn't write it.",1491091200,6,4379,4.7678100263852246

257768,3,6300215628,"I love Cary Grant movies, so I was excited to watch this one.  The plot was sort of zany but fun, however at a certain point in the movie, Grant's character makes decisions that don't really make sense, but clearly are designed to get the movie to the end outcome.
SPOILER ALERT:
For example, the movie clearly has the relationship between Grant and Loren going along, then all of a sudden Grant's deceased wife's sister is a love interest.  Grant...sort of...pursues her briefly (which makes no sense) then ends up ditching her at the last moment for Loren.  But the sister ends up as a bridesmaid/maid of honor in the final scene at Grant and Loren's wedding.

Everything else was cute, funny and classically Cary Grant.",1462233600,,722,4.7063492063492065

If you haven't seen it in awhile I believe another view is indicated just because these classic movies aren't possible anymore.  It must be the times we're living.

Watching it again after ten years, I realized how beautiful and talented Sophia was, not just with her beauty, which was absolutely extraordinary, but her tone of voice expressing her femininity and motherliness in taking an interest in three motherless children.  She would not be shown as being so inept in household duties today (back then it was unusual if a woman did not know how to cook and sew, since more women were stay at home moms, though in this film she is the daughter of a wealthy orchestra conductor, and would have had a maid or cook). Grant was at his best also.  Great chemistry.  Paul Peterson, who played the oldest son, has become a staunch defender of child actors who both are successful and unsuccessful as adult actors.  Wonderful film for everyone including children.",1423267200,,884,4.751633986928105

Across town, Sophia Loren is running away from her rich father's iron will and offers to be a nanny to the kids. She's not middle aged in this movie; she is stunningly beautiful. (she still is)

It's an adorable story and I adore Loren who ironically enough supposedly was asked by Grant to marry him while filming a previous movie a year before.

258917,5,6300215628,"Wrecked lives converge, unexpectedly, on a wrecked houseboat of last resort. It's about parenting : children without a mother, and desperately needing one; a son wanting to grow up to please a father who expects too much; a grown daughter trying to prove that her father is too controlling, yet falls in love with a man who's also too controlling; and a father, maybe two, who learns that releasing power may be the only way to gain control of life in a tailspin. Yet, in a playfully written story, everyone learns, each from the others, that ""family"" means being a small important part of a bigger picture.

The film is well written, the music is toe-tapping, the characters actually have specific personalities, which means the actors were good at their jobs, and............it's Cary Grant and Sophia Loren for crying out loud!

I'm betting you'll think it was worth the time to watch!",1405209600,,888,4.8355263157894735

258966,3,6300215628,"These two big stars sell the movie in spite of the weak premise of the script and some annoying dialogue (how Grant thinks Loren--a conductor's daughter--is a poor, dirty war bride; her flirting with his little sons while ignoring his daughter). Loren seems too cold to really fit the part, but she's so beautiful in an unusual way that she makes the scenes interesting.

Sophia Loren was only 24 (Grant was over 50) but she looks and acts older. (At the time they were filming, Loren had ended her relationship with Grant who was still deeply in love--later said she was the love of his life--and wanted to marry her. Knowing she dropped him for the even-older and not at all good-looking Italian movie producer Carlo Ponti just made their scenes together a little more interesting. The scene where they dance at the country club, his expressions looks very real--if he was in the moment IRL...lots of courage to put it on film. In any case, that scene almost boosted this to 4 stars...and then there's Harry Guardino who's so good...but the script just brings it down (maybe 3 1/2 )

Still, nice to see these great stars in a lighthearted wholesome film, fun enough for the family, especially if you're not concentrating too hard.",1403308800,,1232,4.725581395348837

I.m a sucker for Cary Grant movies haven't hated any of them. And Sophia was so (is) gorgeuos.

Cary Grant is charming as always even in this 'paint by the numbers' movie. It's amazing how much child actors have improved since this movie was made.

The child actors are just awful, but maybe it is the super cute writing that spoils their roles.  The writing overall is just plain bad and we all know exactly where this film is headed (the handsome widower and wildly sexy ""maid"").  It is slow moving and has crazily unlikely scenes where a house being moved is parked on the tracks by an idiot and destroyed by a moving train without consequences to anyone except the house.  I imagine it is supposed to be funny, but it is just plain silly. Not recommended unless you just like ogling Sophia Loren in her 20's.",1396828800,3,725,4.462121212121212

Cary Grant stars as the father who needs to get to know 3 adorable kids and Sophie Loren stars as a sheltered rich girl wanting to learn about the United States and the real world.

259381,3,6300215628,I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies years ago. I have been looking for a copy ever since. I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon Instant Video. I thought it was interesting to see Cary and Sophia together. The movie was different than what I remembered. The coloring was bad. Sophia looked orange. The storyline was unrealistic in many ways. Why would a rich woman want to go off and be a nanny? Would the two characters really not sleep together while on the houseboat? The ending was happy but predictable. I guess the main draw for me was seeing two of my favorite actors together.,1390176000,,592,4.440366972477064

I fell for Sophia Loren when I first saw her in 1963.  I will look at anything if she is in it and have seldom been disappointed.  The only disappointments I can think of are some movies in Italian and I can't see the subtitles.  So I admit prejudice.  The movie is not the best I have ever seen nor is it the worst.  The plot is not strong, the script is not the best, but I enjoyed it.  Maybe you will also.  All reviews are relative because we judge from out own preference.

Fresh widower with three kids in post wwii Washington D.C. runs into free spirited rich runaway whose father is a famous conductor for the symphony . She is tired of being dragged from town to town without ever getting to live a little . Cary Grant's seven year old runs off the same night and she ends up taking him home. She is an instant success with the kids and Cary thinks she's a flung off almost G.I. bride, she winks and says the fancy clothes came from her father , the truth yet an implied lie. The sister in law had been taking care of the kids and it was time he stepped up to the plate and started taking care of them. He ends up hiring Sophia to help with the house,he just jumped to the assumption that she is poor because her dress got dirty when she went out the window to the boat to ""row"" away. The problem is the house that he  was supposed to live in is being moved to the lot that day and well it gets hit by a train right in front of them while the trailer it was on was parked on the tracks. The driver got sidetracked looking at Sophia's legs. Now they are on a temporary Houseboat owned by the trailer driver a fellow italian and hound dog by nature. He keeps trying to date her the whole movie. She knows how to handle him .

260151,4,6300215628,"I love old movies, but often times they feel stilted in their dialogue and/or they gloss over real-life difficulties. As a long time fan of Sophia Loren (what's not to like?), I picked up a copy of ""Houseboat"" and sat down to watch it with my wife and teen daughter. To our pleasant surprise, the film tells a story that still feels relevant in many ways.

The story starts with Cary Grant, a recent widower, demanding custody of his three young children. He is a working man, in Washington D.C., and he drags the kids there against their wishes. They are mouthy, funny, and painfully sad. They would prefer staying with Aunt Carolyn, Grant's sister-in-law, on sprawling property far from D.C. Carolyn has always had a secret love for Grant, and she dreams of stepping in as the new wife and step-mother. Tensions rise when young and beautiful Sophia Loren appears on the scene. She is visiting America with her famous Italian father, a symphony conductor, and she wants to be free of his overbearing ways. When she runs into Grant's youngest son, she relates to his daddy-troubles and forms a quick bond that eventually lands her in the role of nanny to Grant's children.

""Houseboat"" moves from humor to romance, and certain elements share similarities with ""The Sound of Music."" The overbearing father who hires the adorable nanny, who then runs off when she realizes her feelings for the man, but comes back because of the children. In this case, the children are less polished and polite, and this creates some believable conflicts for all concerned. In the end, it's a happy story, and even my teen daughter found herself sitting through the entire thing, despite her initial thoughts that ""it's an old movie, and I'll be bored.""",1314230400,,1735,4.79933110367893

If there is any reason to watch this film, it is the chemistry between Grant and Loren, who had been in a real life relationship not long before filming began.  The situation, however, is highly contrived and the scriptwriters (Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose) are all too willing to cast all logic aside for the sake of some rather slight gags.

Cary Grant is a divorced man whose wife has been raising their children. He loves the kids but doesn't have a clue or a manual. When the ex wife dies, he is left in a position to take care of them. He does the best he can which is none too well.

Grant realizes that he will need to take some time away from his job in DC. He plans to move to the country closer to his ex inlaws. This is done with the idea that they will help with the kids and also because there is a suspicion that he will eventually marry the younger sister of his former wife. (Apparently there is a history.) The aunt gets along well with the kids who are not thrilled with their father.

Meanwhile, Sofia Loren is the daughter of a famous Italian musician on tour. She is chaffing under her father's stern rule and just wants to have some fun. She makes an escape and meets up with one of the kids who helps her to escape from her father's minions. She returns the boy home and is coaxed into serving as a nanny for the kids.

Grant's plans for moving do not work out as expected and the whole family temporarily ends up living on a houseboat. The comedy takes off from there as Loren and Grant find that they have feelings for each other and the kids stir things up.

Mel Shavelson, who did a lot of romantic pictures like ""April in Paris"" and ""Yours, Mine and Ours"", did a great job pooling the acting team together in an innocent comedy that works the way they should - and that is not easy.

But the notion of seeing what isn't in the eye of the beholder draws you to each film as you impatiently await the leading man to ""discover"" her.

Cinzia Zaccardi (Loren) is the wealthy daughter of orchestra conductor Arturo Zaccardi (Eduard Ciannelli). As such, she is lavished in opulent dwellings and dinners with international nobles. What's missing from this overprotected woman's life is a MAN.

Tom Winters (Grant) is a diplomat who neglected his parental responsibilities for the sake of his career. After his wife dies he gets the urge to do the right thing. The problem is, he is evidently clueless about what that is. He quickly learns that raising children is a joint responsibility. Though he hires an unlikely nanny, he feels the logical matrimonial choice is a woman who helped care for his three children before he came on the scene. His current nanny, who neither cooks nor cleans well, is good at eventually obtaining whatever she wants. After all, she's the spoiled runaway daughter of Arturo, the orchestra conductor.

Despite the too-often sung bing-bang-bong song, HOUSEBOAT is a repeat-watch movie. My only problem is that I've seen it so many times on VHS that I would only purchase it used on DVD at a heavily discounted price just to complete my collection. (Update 9/29/06: I bought the DVD.)

260300,5,6300215628,"The Houseboat is a very romantic, light-hearted movie. It is a little gem with Cary Grant playing his usual role of a debonaire bachelor with a little twist - this time he's a widower, a single father of three young children who suddenly decides that the children have to live with him. Suffice it to say that he's had very little previous experience raising his kids - and it shows! Another improbable twist - enter the rebellious daughter of an Italian music conductor as a nanny (a very young and very exotic Sophia Loren) - and the fun begins. The family and the nanny are planning to move to a guest house not far from the family of his late wife, but they need to relocate it to another place nearby and the guest house is getting ruined in the process. The houseboat is offered as a replacement and here they start a new life - simple, with very little amenities, but full of fun, love and occasional soul-searching.  Cary Grant plays the role with his usual flair, but I thought I've seen a milder and gentler side of him in his interactions with the kids. Sophia Loren was rather exquisite in appearance and a bit too headstrong for the role of a nanny, but then she was a spoiled daughter of a famous father in the movie, so her sometimes odd behavior does not really feel entirely unnatural. The kids were great. Their feelings are always on the surface, played very naturally, and that adds enormously to the movie's emotional charge. The DVD is not much, but it's OK - it is in color, in mono sound, the additional features are very limited - only a couple of trailers and a rather nice photo gallery - but I did not expect much from a DVD with a 1958 movie, I wanted it for a movie itself and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1127606400,5,1731,4.375776397515528

260302,5,6300215628,"Welcome to the Houseboat, where Cary Grant lives with his 3 children. And his lovely housekeeper/babysitter Sophia Loren. Cary Grant portrays a man, who divorced his wife, and after his wife dies. Comes back to get his kids. But his kids can't stand him at all. Well one evening he takes the kids to the opera, and his youngest child escapes. And Cinzia Zaccardi (Sophia Loren), takes him back. He tries to pay Cinzia money for rescuing his kid but she won't take it, and then he asks her if she would like to be their housekeeper but she isn't interested. But the kids won't let him get to sleep until he chooses to hire her. The next day he decides to move the country, and Cinzia comes over. And says that she would like the job. Tom Winston (Cary Grant), hires her. They then move onto a houseboat, and have lots of fun escapades. The kids are great in this movie, and Sophia Loren is a perfect mother role, and Cary Grant is the perfect romantic. As he does in all of his films. I highly suggest this movie to all. This is a excellent Family Film, that you can show to your children, without worrying about them learning anything bad, or seeing anything innapropriate.",1118880000,,1173,4.435185185185185
260303,5,6300215628,"Houseboat was the first movie I ever saw in a drive-in.  Imagine seeing Cary Grant and Sophia Loren dancing to a Sam Cooke love song on a screen the size of a football field. The wardrobe for the movie is stunning.  When did we stop taking the time to dazzle with matching hats, gloves, etc.?  Obvious beauty aside, what really impressed me was the award winning script.  The explanation Cary Grant gives as a parent about death, and the kids dialogue and behavior rang true.  The kids behaved like any children would when one parent dies, and an absentee parent appears to take them from the safe world of their grandparents.  The kids were terrific in their roles.  Cary Grant and Sophia Loren were superb considering she had just dumped him to marry her current husband.  One wonders what would have happened if Cary and Sophia had really married.  Would they have lived happily ever after like they did in Houseboat?  Who knows.  At least we can have that fantasy time and time again on DVD.",1081123200,102,995,4.596590909090909
260304,5,6300215628,"HOUSEBOAT is one of my favorite movies.  I remember my family taping it when I was about 7, and I loved watching it.  Needless to say, when the new DVD version was released I instantly snapped it up!
The story is about a widowed Government official (Cary Grant) and his three unruly children.  A chance meeting throws the beautiful Cinzia Zaccardi (lovely Sophia Loren) into their lives.  Cinzia is the daughter of a prominent classical conductor, and is looking for a change of scene.  When she decides to become the children's nanny, no-one is prepared for the hilarity and heartache that is to follow...
This is indeed a lovely family film, with a few shades of ""The Sound of Music"".  The new DVD version offers an average-looking transfer of the film, with a photo gallery and two trailers as the extras.
Also starring Martha Hyer, Harry Guardino, Paul Petersen and Eduardo Cinanelli.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1055894400,42,922,4.909677419354839
260305,4,6300215628,"The editorial reviews pass this off as a minor film with only the two stars - Cary Grant and Sophia Loren - making it worth your time.  They are both great but this film has a little more going for it. Cary Grant is beyond the years when he would stand in the background and steal scenes with facial gestures, here he is well into his Hitchcock years. The 50s was a time of sophistication and pure charm for Cary and Sophia Loren was every thirteen year old boys fantasy.
The story is okay in that you know it will end with Cary and Sophia in each other's arms and everybody happy. But that's what a romantic comedy is and if you enjoy romantic comedies you will not be disappointed. Cary is taking on the responsibility of raising his three children alone on a houseboat and Sophia, running away from her famous orchestra conductor father, is the maid. The Maid! Can imagine Sophia as your maid? Or anybody's maid?  Through kid problems, arguments, boyfriends, ups and downs, and country club dances it all ends well. It is the two stars that are the attraction here certainly, but wait; there's more. The film would remain a 3 star middle of the road film if it were not for the nice comedic bit by Harry Guardino and a great score. The score is not on a par with Doctor Zhivago by any means but it fits the film nicely and the lead song by Sam Cooke - Almost In Your Arms - is terrific. I bumped the film up a star for Harry Guardino and Sam Cooke's song.",1049155200,25,1458,4.278985507246377
260306,4,6300215628,"Charming is the word that best describes this movie--two charming stars and three charming children act out a charming story in a charming landscape. Although probably not ""great cinema"" by anyone's standard, it provides for me a welcome 2-hour escape from the stresses of modern life. In this fantasy world, you never doubt that Sophia Loren's ""fine Italian hand that can't cook, clean, or do the laundry"" will put everything right and that everyone will live happily ever after.
Whenever I hear an ad for a modern movie that claims it will ""change my life"", I want to pull out an old movie like this whose ambition was simply to entertain.",1048809600,7,641,4.783783783783784
