8264251,5,B0016ZZVW0,I have purchased several copies of this for myself and friends. It is three hours long on two DVD's but I loved  it and so has everyone else who has seen it. I get rave reviews on feedback. It covers a lifetime of one of the most complex persons I have ever studied.,1411862400,,266,4.018867924528302

8264253,5,B0016ZZVW0,"Frederick Lewis's superbly crafted movie about the life of American iconoclast Rockwell Kent will rekindle the case for the artist's place at the top of the 20th C. art paragon.

From the remarkably appropriate music to the crisply written and well paced narration, the 2+ hour film presents period footage alongside Lewis' majestic film work- as he revisits many of Kent's worldwide sites, and weaves vast, sublime scenes with intimate retellings from the prolific Kent's journals, letters and books. The artist's dreamlike, sharp focused and intensely colored paintings are reproduced with vivid contrast against black and white film shot by Kent and fellow trekkers and reveal the almost superhuman achievements of this artist, illustrator, writer, explorer, naturalist, lobsterman, well digger, architect, engineer, political activist, dairyman, sometimes husband, and devoted (but often absent) father. Amid his sometimes infuriating dual nature- a man with a tremendous capacity to share his gifts and enjoin others to find their authentic life, while at the same time often escaping family responsibilities and constancy in relationships- Kent is, yet, shown to be a passionate champion for his fellow man, for wilderness, for the self reliant individuality that is the core archetype of the great American hero. And his images- arctic villages beneath sun shot icebergs, wood engravings of the ascending, boat crushing Moby Dick; lone, wandering figures mustering courage beneath a starry Unknown- report the still required initiation of man in the midst of a mysterious, elusive Providence glimmering in the near and far reaches of a still unconquered Earth.

Rockwell Kent's reconsideration as a major American vanguard is given much momentum here, as the sheer quantitative output of work in oil, ink, woodcuts and mural formats surpasses any mid-century artist one can think of. Kent remains the Century's finest illustrator, one of the best travel/adventure writers our nation has ever produced, and a significant American visionary modern artist. His work is now considered more symbolist or early modernist than the once mis-categorized ""regionalist"" or mere ""realist"".  Finally, with Director Lewis' astonishing orchestration of fluidly woven episodes of Kent's ferocious wanderlust and nearly monastical, holed-up studio production, the entranced, visually overwhelmed viewer might only now empathically comprehend the scope of Rockwell Kent's vision and influence- this film is the story of American ingenuity, resourcefulness, and necessary bombast, against a civilization bent, after mid-century, on formulaic and systematic conformity. Kent remains, as viivifyingly seen through Lewis'  lens, a great American master and voice for the only kind of unabashed individuation that makes for great and enduring things.",1342137600,3,2834,5.7404761904761905
8264254,5,B0016ZZVW0,"I can't imagine anyone doing a better job connecting the dots of such a spectacularly lived life. Fiercely gifted. Fiercely independent. Fiercely heterosexual. Fiercely socialist (NOT communist--socialist). Spring for the price and buy this DVD. It's the product of 10 years of obsession by its maker. Presented in two, 86 min halves, balancing the more painterly and adventuresome part of his life against the more public part of his life. You already know it's a good story; now find out how well it can be told in a documentary.",1286323200,3,531,4.977528089887641
8264255,5,B0016ZZVW0,"Loaded with breathtaking paintings and prints, on-location and historic film footage, and well narrated, this film succeeds from every angle. Kent did well as an artist, writer, and political activist. It seems he was mediocre as a dairy farmer, and has to receive failing grades as a husband. ""Absentee"" is the adjective that comes to mind in regard to his abilities as a father.

Having known Kent's son Rocky, I was especially interested in the account of the winter the two spent on a remote island off Alaska when the boy was only 9 years old. If the boy's mother didn't realize the danger the boy was in during this adventure, she must have found out when the book was published. Interesting that Kent gave Rocky painting lessons, not knowing at the time that Rocky was colorblind. Enjoyed the few early photos of Rocky, who was undoubtedly the model for many of Kent's works.

The material is presented without judgement on Kent's behavior, which at times was self-centered to say the least. Highly entertaining and informative.",1221955200,8,1035,4.875
8264256,5,B0016ZZVW0,"I saw a facinating documentary film on the artist Rockwell Kent on PBS the other night. I had never heard of him, despite my minoring in Art History as an undergraduate! He was a Painter-Illustrator-Architect-Carpenter-Adventurer-Author who started with the NY ""Ashcan"" School at the turn of the 19th/20th Century, was an early ""Wobbly"" style Socialist, was snubbed at the NYC Armory show in 1913, prospered between 1920 to 1940, was Blacklisted in the 50s and died in 1968.

  Despite Kent's great fame and high-profile American popularity, by the time I took Art History classes in the late 60's, Rockwell Kent & his representational style was ""out of favor"" in deference to the Abstract Expressionism of the time, in addition to sheer political vindictiveness of the American Inquisition of the Cold War. There are not that many Americans Artists who were also Social Activists, and I am gratified to learn of his life and work!

  As an artist myself, I found his rich pictorial landscapes from life of Alaska, Greenland and the Cape Horn Area especially breathtaking and inspiring! A fine draftsman, a Prolific Artist.

  Kent was the first ""Western"" artist to have a one-man show in the Soviet Union...

  As desciplined as Picasso, and also exceeded Picasso's philandering by far... All in all, a facinating story! Combine the energy of Picasso & the expert technique of New England Artist Wyeth the Elder into one & you can only start to get an idea as to who Rockwell Kent was was...

  Unfortunately, even during his heyday he became eclipsed in fame by Norman Rockwell, and Rockwell Kent was confused with Norman until his death.

  This documentary, Written & Directed by Frederick Lewis, was shot at all the actual locations, liberally sprinkled with countless examples of Kent's work, took 13 years to create & was completed in 2005. A Tour de Force in the Art of the Documentary... Bravo, Frederick- what a Legacy!",1210982400,7,1929,4.956386292834891
