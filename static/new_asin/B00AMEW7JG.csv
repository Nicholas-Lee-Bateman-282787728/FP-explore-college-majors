8553633,1,B00AMEW7JG,"Yeah, agree with the other two reviews here - poor quality product (on DVD-R, which is NOT mentioned in the listing), bad transfer, not to mention a genuinely boring movie, with lots of narrator voice-over and wooden acting.  All in all, a VERY poor release, which means I'm going to cancel my other order from this company...",1359417600,2,326,4.719298245614035
8553634,1,B00AMEW7JG,"I bought this (and will return it) hoping this was from a better source. ITS NOT!!! This appears to be from Sinister Cinema, its has the same skips, scratches, splices, jumps & and video lines, (yes its a vhs transfer) that mine has that I bought from SC. Now don't get me wrong I buy a lot from SC, there the leading source for rare obscure films, and they have the best sources avalible, but this bozo company has ether bought SCs print or found a way to remove SCs logo. They state uncut, how would they know, the box artwork is from ""The House on Haunted Hill"" the disc arrived scratched ( disc was still on the hub) it had finger prints all over the disc. BEWARE! Bozo company trying to make a quick buck at movie lovers expense!!!!",1358899200,2,737,4.271428571428571
8553635,2,B00AMEW7JG,"Not to be nit picky here but I was just wondering why the cover of this movie is using the movie poster from ""House on Haunted Hill"" ? Just wondering if ""Ghost of Rashmon Hall"" didn't have it's own poster ??",1358294400,,207,4.073170731707317
