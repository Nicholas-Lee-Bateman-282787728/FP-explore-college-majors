8452803,5,B0051IAW40,"This is a MUST if you want to learn self-defense or sparring technquies. I've been looking for a system like this for years. My opinion there are three types of fighters learn by experiment, by instinct and by having a plan. Shawn shows you how to have fun and be learning at the same time. This Man ain't nothing but the truth. No foundation you will not stand. And I'm a 3rd degree and I will receive from any style to help myself and others to protect themselves. Thanks again Master Kovacich you give the arts a very good name. And I also like to thank your Teachers for all their help. You all should be very proud. I will be buying your others products. Great Success Sir.",1335484800,2,678,4.3046875
8452804,5,B0051IAW40,"I am a martial artist (2nd degree black belt) and I have all the books of the series and two of the three DVDs made by the author. I find the amount and the quality of the material offered by the author is so important that every martial artist, or anyone who is interested in MMA fighting or self-defense, should know.

Footwork is so important in both martial arts and self-defense and too often, attention is given on the way kicks are supposed to be executed at the expense of proper footwork. I always had the impression that instructors assume that a fighter will learn footwork as they advance in their skills. This may be true for some few but for many, good instruction on the subject is really fundamental. This DVD is what we all need, regardless of the level of skill.

The DVD follows a basic format: each segment is first presented ""in real life situation,"" then, Mr Kovacich explains in great details - even using diagrams - and applies it again to life situations. Mr Kovacich speaks without a script and is quite clear. One can tell that has been instructing for quite some times. The DVD is divided into chapters and each builds on the other in a logical way: from the simplest to the more advanced.

I have come to rely on Mr Kovacich's work and expertise and the more I advance in my training the more I rely on his knowledge. I would recommend this DVD to both white belts (learn good footwork at the beginning!) and to Black Belts and all in between. Footwork is fundamental and therefore worth going over after each belt promotion.

I can't wait to see what else Mr Kovacich is going to publish next.",1311379200,4,1623,4.472972972972973
8452805,5,B0051IAW40,"The title of the series is ""Acheiving Kicking Excellence: Footwork for Kicking"" by Shawn Kovacich. The production quality of this DVD is considerably higher than most martial arts DVDs. In this DVD Mr Kovachich breaks down kicking footwork into very clear and concise steps and points that should help almost anyone who wants to improve their kicking technique. As I am always telling my students, improving technique is the key to increasing power.

Shawn teaches the viewer many ways to improve their fighting with Footwork, including how to control distance, how to setup various kicks effectively, how to counter various techniques with footwork, and how to obtain a dominant angle to obtain an opening to attack.

Although footwork is arguably the first part of kicking technique that should be learned, it is rarely taught with any competency at all. The student and teacher, by using this DVD, can open up a much deeper conversation about kicking footwork which can only lead to improvement in kicking technique.

I will be recommending this content to all of my students.",1309996800,6,1079,5.084745762711864
