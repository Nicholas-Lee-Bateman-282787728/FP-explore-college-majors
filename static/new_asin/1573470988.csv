192047,2,1573470988,"The movie had a somewhat interesting begining. An entire group of people are invited to an old haunted mansion by a witch with a desire for revenge. Revenge for her ancestors which were killed by you guessed it the ancentors of the visitors. The movie had a classic horror film feel to it. One it took place in a haunted, or supposidly haunted mansion. Two the story was one featured in many classic horror films(a witch who is killed during the puritan era is back to inflict revenge.)There were things about the film I did find interesting. One was the odd way some of the scenes were shot. This reminded me of the classic episodes of the batman televion series were the camera would lean slightly in one direction. I thought the protagonist character who was an applied science major was somewhat original in comparision to the sterotypical stoners who accompany him to the mansion. There acting was sub par and laughable at times. (not in a good way) The antagonist( the girl who bring her evil withc ancenstor back to life was an alright actress who at times does a decent job added to the film. The costumes of makeup were actually done well, especially the makeup of the lead resurrected witch. In spite of it positives witchouse falls flat because of bad acting and mediocre writing.",1090108800,4,1291,4.666666666666667
192048,3,1573470988,"Some rich college kids who are descendants of the mob who burned those notoriously accused of witchcraft, are invited to a mysterious house by a classmate who they used to pick on in high school {the odd dark-haired, black-wearing ""freak"" who actually had deeper interests in life than merely getting drunk and smoking marijuana}; and there are a couple of stoner characters herein which personify this lowlife trait - as well as other pretentious suburban bunnies; but that seems to be the perfect bait; a wonderful Lair that could be appreciated by any Satanist, and are greeted by the resident mistress of the house - a gorgeous brunette in black with long-flowing garments, who subsequently invites them to participate in a seance after revealing a silver pentagram on the floor while another two disappear into the fetters of the mansion to indulge in the sacrament. The resident 'witch' lapses into a trance, summoning forth a hag-witch ancestor who incrementally preys upon the group in kind.
One by one they are dispatched and turned into zombies - their souls absorbed by the hag, until a ""nerdy"" couple finally confront her with the scientific method. A seeming statement of technology countering superstition. The prosthetics are average 'FX/CGI is most remarkable here, with many power bolts being thrown about. The hag is a bit cannibalistic / vampiric at times, seeking justice for being murdered. Of note, in one scene, one of the characters is whisked into the past to be in the place of the 'witch' being burned, that he may know what it feels like, by what his christian ancestors committed, was a nice touch.
This film pretty much amounts to the plethora of movies capitalizing on the 'iwtchtryal' misjustices of the christian past, although for the record, no accused 'witches' were actually burned in America, which was the modes of execution in Europe, whereas the colonies preferred the methods of including slow-hanging, dowsing, the hand vice, and various method of torture. Of course, these were not actual ""witches"", Satanists, etc. anyway, but victims of petty squabbled from neighbors; attractive women who refused the advances from the Witchfynders, of roving husbands that accused them of seducing them, instead of admitting to infidelity; solitary persons upon which urban legendry was projected, etc., not practicing 'witches'. That fact stated, Witchouse is pure entertainment fare, ideal for parties perhaps, but not for any serious consideration.
This film does contain the ubiquitous demoralization in the end. Good as a rental",1084752000,2,2564,5.195652173913044

The packaging for this states that the extras include 40 Full Moon trailers, 2 theatrical trailers (funny since this movie was direct to video), Cast info, and a Featurette: The Making of Witchouse.  What you REALLY get is 6 trailers, 34 less than advertised, lame cast bios and no Featurette.  Someone over at Full Moon made a pretty big mistake and noone else there caught it. I think anyone interested in this should be aware of what you are really getting, ripped off!  For the price, the DVD with the extras it has is pretty good, but since it advertises more than it delivers, the rating suffers.

That way you don't end up like the idiots in that Insurance TV ad that reminds you that when you're in a horror movie, you make bad decisions because that's what you do.

Actually this is one of those horror movies that's so terrible, it's actually good.
In it's own very twisted way, It's really hysterical; completely unintentional of course, but it just worked out that way.

192116,1,1573470988,"The first question to contemplate about ""Witchouse"" is: why is it one word? Why isn't it ""Witch House"" or ""Witchhouse""?

The second is why anyone made this movie in the first place.

 ""Witchouse"" is one of those so-bad-it's-hilarious movies that Full Moon Entertainment/Pictures/ Features/Whatever churned out in the '80s and '90s, usually with nonsensical scripts and entertainingly awful acting. ""Witchouse"" is one of the more hilariously awful examples of their output -- it's a pretty awful horror movie, but it's fun to laugh at the constant ineptitude. Seriously, who DOESN'T notice an evil undead witch walking five feet behind them?

Several stereotypical college students (slut, jock, virgin, bad girl, stoner, nerd, mousy girl) are invited to Witchouse, an old mansion in the town of Dunwich. Their hostess is Elizabeth (Ashley McKinney), a rather strange former classmate who has decided to celebrate May Day with a creepy Halloweeny party. She also regales them with the story of her ancestress Lilith, a powerful but rather indiscreet witch who was burned by witch-hunters after she tried to sacrifice a child.

Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth is actually a witch herself. And since evil powers aren't enough for her, she plans to sacrifice a pair of people she already beheaded in order to resurrect Lilith (Ariauna Albright), who now looks like a cut-rate ""Buffy"" vampire. The potential victims have all split into their own little groups, and it's up to the only people with brains to figure out why they were singled out for Lilith's vengeance.

""Witchouse"" is a pretty by-the-numbers horror movie -- it's a standard supernatural-creature-wants-revenge plot, with a painfully typical cast of idiots who do all the usual things before dying/being possessed. There's not really a plot, just a lot of people wandering around and getting picked off VERY SLOWLY by the witch. It's about as horrifying as glimpsing the back of your fridge.

It's also pretty clear that nobody involved in production actually cared about what they were doing. One particularly laughable scene has Elizabeth attributing some of the greatest disasters in history to May Day (uh, lady, Vesuvius erupted in LATE SUMMER). Another has an unfortunate pair of lovers being beheaded by a mysterious witch... who is clearly standing at least ten feet away, and puts no energy into her swipes.

And Lilith doesn't seem to be in a hurry for her revenge. Apparently she can be stopped by a closed door, and she allows her potential victims to scheme for several minutes before actually meandering in to destroy them.
And the glimpses of Puritan-era witch-burnings establish that everybody dressed in Ye Olde S&Mwear, and for some reason they kept around a bunch of guys shaking their heads really fast.

The characters are also so gloriously shallow that they may give you paper cuts. Each one has a single characteristic -- one is a stoner, one is a slut, one is a shy virgin -- and nothing more than that, although there are some feeble attempts to flesh out the most sympathetic of the gang. McKinney is particularly bad -- her character just comes across as a bratty little girl dabbling the occult, and every single word she says telegraphs, ""I am an evil witch.""

And a fun fact: the tomboyish bad-girl Janet is played by Brooke Mueller, long before she became Charlie Sheen's third ex-wife. This movie will make you grateful that she didn't continue her acting career, because she has the acting ability of a rotting log -- her attempts to sound ""street"" are like listening to cats having a screech-off.

""Witchouse"" is an awful, awful movie... and yet it's also strangely hilarious in its relentless badness. If nothing else, hold a riffing party with some like-minded friends... and plenty of alcohol.",1369958400,2,3784,5.067524115755627
192117,1,1573470988,"But this was just terrible.  I don't think anyone in the cast had ever acted above high school theater and they delivered their lives as if they were being read off cue cards.  It was so annoyingly bad that I could not enjoy it as a bad horror film (and I like bad horror films).  In a rare switch the squeal Witchouse 2 is much better.

192120,4,1573470988,"Full Moon productions made some of the best cheesy horror movies of all time. Puppet Master and Subspecies are two wonderful examples. Witchouse is another of their great hidden treasures.

When Elizabeth LeFay gathers her college friends to her old, family mansion of May Day, she invites the diverse group for a party. What ensues is a gory, revenge blood bath where Elizabeth's ancestor, an infamous witch named Lilith LeFay, rises from the dead and extracts revenge on the descendents of the puritans who murdered her, three hundred years before.

Yes, the special effects aren't the best, neither is the acting, but the over all energy of the film is infectious and you find yourself sucked in and swept away over the scant 70 minutes the film takes.
