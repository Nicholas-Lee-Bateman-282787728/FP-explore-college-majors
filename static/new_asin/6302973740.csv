526274,4,6302973740,"As a physicist, I enjoyed this film a lot.  The scientists working on the Manhattan project, and their inward and outward conflicts, are portrayed very believably.  To the extent the film delves into the science, it is very accurate too.

The one sour note, however, is that the last third of the film pushes a very definite political agenda.  President Truman is portrayed as a shallow, ignorant buffoon.  The use of the atomic bomb to end the war is portrayed as an indefensible moral outrage.  While that is an arguable (but incorrect, IMO) point of view, the last 45 minutes are almost Orwellian in hitting the viewer over the head with one particular interpretation to the exclusion of other, equally defensible ones.

For a film that goes to great lengths (and largely succeeds) in closely following the historical facts, this sudden twist into advocacy on a point of considerable controversy was disappointing.  A more balanced exploration of the morality of using the bomb, rather than caricature, would have been a better way to end this otherwise great film.",1174435200,14,1068,4.96067415730337

Dennehy's performace as General Groves and Strathairn (of Good Night and Good Luck) does an amazing job as Oppenheimer.

Tibbets is shown a couple of times, but the footage of the B-29 Enola Gay is taken from newsreel footage or lifted from another movie, and shown in blue tinted b/w.  Since the rest of the film is in color, I think that I would have found a way around this dramatically, perhaps by showing people watching a newsreel.  The Nagasaki bombing is not shown at all.

The moments that required dramatization seemed honest and in keeping with the personalities of the respective characters.

By comparison I watched a few episodes of Manhattan, the recent TV mini-series, and found it woefully historically inaccurate. Two other movies I recommend are ""White Light, Black Rain"" and ""Fat Man & Little Boy.""

526341,1,6302973740,This is a fantastic movie--I saw it when it first came out and have not been able to find it until recently on Amazon. The single star rating is strictly for the quality of the video itself. I paid $9.99 to buy this Amazon Instant Video and was overcharged by $9.00 due to the extremely poor quality.  The video is very blurry and jerky--sometimes it looks like the camera has been fast forwarded in the middle of a scene. This is too bad since this is a very interesting movie but it just is not enjoyable with such poor video quality. Take my advice and pass on this one.,1419552000,4,573,4.256880733944954

526374,5,6302973740,"I was all set to defend ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" and bought this (along with David Strathairn's SECOND rendering of Robert Oppenheimer-The Trials of Robert Oppenheimer-PBS video) in order to post an informed opinion.  FM&LB has strengths (including some onscreen rendering of actual accounts of military oversight unpleasantness regarding Oppenheimer's personal life that are born out in the PBS video) and a dramatization of one of the incidents that gave ""The Demon Core"" its name are among them.  All that having been said, people who have reviewed that movie and found it too ""melodramatic"" are spot on.  It's not that I don't think that anyhing salacious happened, I just don't think it happened in that way or to that extent. I wasn't there, it just smells a little too much like ""Hollywood"" or a pulp novel.  THIS hits all the historical high notes and is very balanced in the way it portrays both the ""pro-use"" and ""anti-use"" parties. It doesn't seek (to its credit) to make either side seem ""buffoonishly"" overdrawn.  The reviewers who complain about the video quality are NOT exaggerating.  MY fear is that it was SHOT TO VIDEO and no superior film based master copy exists.  If ever there was a television production deserving of a remastering and release on Blu-Ray, this would be a leading candidate.  Buy it and be prepared to tweak your TV's ""error concealment"" noise reduction settings.  Dennehy was EXCELLENT, but Strathairn steals the show and (bafflingly) gets last place billing.  It's no wonder he was tapped for the PBS project.  His demeanor matches what you see on news footage to a fare thee well.",1412035200,11,1622,4.904761904761905

Great movie, but the DVD looks like it was copied from a VCR tape in EP mode.  I'm serious; it looks blurry like a poor quality EP recording.  I quit watching it after about 20 minutes, but eventually watched the whole movie.  It clears up a little about half-way through, but still EP quality.

526436,5,6302973740,"OK, it's fictionalized, but unlike any other movie doing this, it covers the story from the physicists first coming up with the theory to the military having to deal with a bunch of eggheads.

I was happy that it's finally become available on DVD, but the transfer is bad, not much better than my old VHS copy. As far as the movie itself, it's the best treatment of the US side of the story, preferable to Fat Man and Little Boy, which suffers, like Midway, by including prominent fictional characters. Standouts in the cast are Brian Dennehy as a driven, fiercely intelligent Leslie Grove and David Strathairn as a sly, bemused, and, ultimately, tortured Robert Oppenheimer).

526458,4,6302973740,"Imagine changing the world and the balance of power in that world forever. Imagine unleashing the power of God on the world. Imagine you helped create an arms race between two superpowers that could spell the end of civilization as we know it. Imagine you did all these things and you would be imagining that you J. Robert Oppenheimer.

Released the same year as Roland Joffe's ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" but as a TV movie, ""Day One"" is the better film that more accurately captures the conflicts, issues and questions of loyalty that drove the team that created the atomic bomb as members of the secret Manhattan Project.

After Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard (Michael Tucker) leaves his Nazi occupied homeland for the United States, he persuades Albert Einstein to write a letter urging FDR to begin research into building a atomic bomb. Szilard realizes that Hitler and the scientists left behind in Europe could easily accomplish this task and it could turn the tide helping the Nazi's to win the war.

FDR  (David Ogden Stiers)approves the project and General Leslie Groves (Brian Dennehy) is put in charge of the project with Groves choosing the left-leaning Berkeley physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (David Strathairn)to  the project because of his brilliant mind and people skills. Oppenheimer and his team including Edward Teller (Olek Krupa), Enrico Fermi (Tony Shalhoub), Richard Feynman (Patrick Breen) and Laus Fuchs (Lorne Brass) tackle what seems like an almost impossible project.

A better written and far balanced view of the creation of the atomic bomb without introducing large chunks of fiction (as happened with ""Fat Man and Little Boy""), ""Day One"" was released last year on DVD from Acorn Media probably to cash in on David Strathairn's zooming career after years of character roles. Featuring a terrific supporting cast, ""Day One"" manages to be both dramatic and far more factual and while it may lack the star power of Paul Newman, Brian Dennehy more than makes up for it with a less affected performance that portrays the complexity of Groves. Strathairn plays the conflicted emotions that Oppenheimer had while working on the project, at the prospect of having to betray friends who were affiliated with the Communist Party and his ability to stay true to the project by focusing on the technical aspects while avoiding the fall out of the political and military ramifications of the atomic bomb until after it is build and exploded for the first time.

TV and film director veteran Joseph Sargent does a terrific job with the film the only flaw is that the film could have used more dynamic editing and less conventional visual set ups to give the film a more cinematic quality. The screenplay by Peter Wyden based on the book Day One: Before and After Hiroshima captures the tension that existed as the Manhattan team raced against the clock to find a suitable method to detonate the bomb.

The transfer looks extremely poor but not so poor that you can't watch the movie. It's a pity as it appears to be drawn from an older video source. It's possible like a lot of TV movies from the time that it was edited on video or that all the post-production was done there which would explain the poor video quality. The other option is that Aaron Spelling Productions provided Acord Media with a source without checking to see if there was a better one for the TV movie. Either way, it's a pity because this is a marvelously written, acted and directed movie.

There aren't any extras worth noting (well, OK, it has a filmography)and that's a pity as well because I'd love to hear about the making of the film.

This is a terrific TV movie with a poor looking transfer and poor extras.",1246752000,12,3706,4.822047244094488
526459,4,6302973740,"I have most of the popular written and video publications on the advent of our nuclear weapon program. I would rate ""Hiroshima"" as the number one video docudrama, and this film a close second. It clearly eclipses the more available ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" in its authenticity. Dennehy's protrayal of Groves is highly credible based on the general's reputation, as is Strathairn's Oppenheimer. Highly recommended for student's of this interesting era of American military history.",1241740800,3,480,5.328947368421052
526460,4,6302973740,"""Day One"" is the story of the development of the atomic bomb by the United States.  Brian Dennehy is tremendous in his role as General Groves, the military commander of the project.  Too often, Hollywood depicts General Groves as a warmongering buffoon, which he was not.  Dennehy gets Groves just right, as the can-do, highly intelligent, and determined military commander of the Manhattan Project.  Michael Tucker is very good as Leo Szilard.  In fact, one of the things that this storyline does very well is to contrast the attitudes of the ""Chicago Group"" led by Szilard, with the people out in the Alamogordo desert, led by Robert Oppenheimer.

The storyline of this film is quite good, and holds the viewer's interest, even though we all know what the ultimate outcome will be -- the problem with all historical pieces of this genre.  The film will make the viewer consider whether dropping the atomic bomb on Japan should have been done or not.  This question will never be fully or satisfactorily answered, although the soldiers and sailors in the Pacific who were preparing for the bloody invasion of Japan had few doubts at the time.  On the other hand, the weapon mostly harmed Japanese civilians at a time when Japan was already defeated militarily.  Did America really wish to be the first country to unleash atomic horror?  There are no easy answers.  Of one thing I am certain--a 21st Century perspective is not useful in judging decisions made by a people in the mid-20th Century who had been struggling through four long years of a world war and who suddenly saw that they had the means of instantly ending it.

This film is far better than ""Fat Man and Little Boy.""  Those who enjoyed this one will likely also enjoy ""Hiroshima"" by Wesley Addy, which is an unusually balanced examination of the decision to use the atomic bomb in World War II.",1237766400,3,1861,4.757009345794392
526461,5,6302973740,"I also agree with all the insights of the positive reviews to DAY ONE.  One point I'd like to emphasize is the point the movie makes of the role of Leo Szilard, played by very well by Michael Tucker.

No other film on the Bomb really captures the whole history, or identifies the significance of the event to the history of science.  Szilard represents the need of science to be open and devoted to collaboration.  The film shows how vital scientists like Szilard are to real inquiry.  And the flim shows how open inquiry is shut down in favor of engineering.  And the film thereby shows how much we have changed, as science is privatized or isolated.  The film shows how competent Szilard was in other areas as well, such as realizing Jews needed to escape from Germany while there was still time, and realizing how to handle to politics when he devised the way to get President Roosevelt's attention to the threat of a German Bomb. Michael Tucker's protrayal of Leo Szilard demonstrates his authenticity, and demonstrates we did really have  alternatives.

And, today, continue to have alternatives in how we conduct science and military policy.

I  hope it is not true that the DVD version released in America deleted crucial Szilard scenes I have in my VHS tape.",1224892800,2,1266,4.709090909090909

Nevertheless, VHS tapes being what they are, I was also really looking forward to an eventual DVD release and was very gratified when it finally came.  Unfortunately, I rejoiced a bit too soon.  First, the video quality of this DVD release is rather poor, barely any better than that of my aging VHS tape.  Second, the program has been edited from the original release.  The editing doesn't seem to be major, but is annoying nonetheless.  I have not yet looked at the entire DVD, but I already noticed two 20-30 seconds deletions in the first half hour.  The first is when Leo Szilard first arrives to Columbia University in March 1939.  The original release showed him emerging from the subway and asking directions to a policeman, which is omitted from the DVD.  The second more important deletion comes at the conclusion of Szilard and Wigner's first visit with Einstein.  In the original release, Einstein suggests that Szilard and Wigner write a letter to President Roosevelt and tells them that he would be happy to sign it, and this is not shown on the DVD.  All in all, such an outstanding movie deserved a much better treatment and the problem is that, now that it has been badly done once, the likeliness of an eventual better DVD release is probably not that high.

In my opinion, Day One is the most accurate portrayal of this huge endeavor. The three primary actors (Dennehy as General Groves, Strathairn as Oppenheimer, and Tucker as Szilard) not only do an outstanding job of capturing their characters, each also bears a strong resemblence to the person they play. Strathairn, in particular, is marvelous and really drives home the angst that Oppie endured. The film remains very true to actual events, for the most part. There's very little artistic license at play here. Towards the end, the plot wanders and moralizes somewhat. But the use of atomic weapons to end WWII remains something of a moral dilemma, even 60 years after the fact. My only real criticism is the rather shallow characterization of President Truman.

7832864,5,6302973740,"I found this movie to be a very factual and historical telling of  the events of the ""Manhatten Project"" and the making of the first atomic bomb.

This was originally a ""made for TV movie"" released in 1989.  It features Brian Dennehey as General Grove and David Strathairn as Robert Oppenheimer.  There are many other famous, and in my opinion, great actors in this movie.  As I have read and learned of the events of the ""Manhattan Project"", this movie, to the best of my knowledge (and opinion), is a very good portrayal of the actual events.  I really liked this movie.

There is a disclaimer printed right on the label in the plastic case for this DVD. It states:

""Due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on this DVD presentation that were beyond our ability to correct from the original materials"".

I did think the ""lighting"" in some of the scenes was a bit dark or murky but did not notice any glaring ""image"" or ""audio"" defects that detracted from my enjoyment of this movie.  I guess I would agree with the disclaimer though.  It may not be the best visual or audio quality you may see on a DVD presentation but I certainly enjoyed it anyway.  I was far more interested in and captivated by the story rather than judging the audio and video quality of the DVD.  I guess what I am trying to say is that even though this is a ""dated"" copy of the original TV movie, if you are like me and more interested in the story, I sure hope you may enjoy it as much as I did.

If you are interested in the history of ""The Manhattan Project"" and the people involved, I would recommend this movie.",1441756800,,1687,4.365384615384615
