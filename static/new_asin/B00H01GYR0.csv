8628921,5,B00H01GYR0,"This DVD provides a great introduction to the use of focus mitts for any skill level.  It also helps to develop punching distance and the beginning of puncher movement.  With the touch and shoot series, it is easy to add punches in combination along with movement.  The drills reinforce the concept of counterpunching and movement after counterpunching.  If you are looking for a DVD to introduce mitt work or supplement an existing program, I highly recommend this DVD.",1387152000,,470,4.987179487179487
8628922,5,B00H01GYR0,"DVD provides a great skill introduction/review for any level of experience.  Identifies and helps develop the skills needed to confidently move towards sparring.  The drills helped me the most with footwork and movement by learning how to move to positions of advantage smoothly and quickly.  The drills are fun and reinforce the concepts.  With some work, improvement will come quickly.  If you do any sparring, the stress level is lower due to the skill improvement and quicker counters.  Recommend and worth including as part of your training!",1386115200,,546,5.218390804597701
