7903070,4,B000003K7J,"Picking up the character of Tom Riker once again was an intriguing prospect for Star Trek fans.  Certainly nearly all of us were wondering what had become of him and if he would make another appearance at all.  So the twist in the second act of this episode that reveals Tom Riker was more than welcome  in fact it seemed overdue.  The writers piqued our interest further by having him act as the leader of a band of The Maquis who return for the first time since second season's 'Tribunal'.  Everything seemed set in place for a great storyline featuring Tom Riker, but we learn that isn't to be the case.
While Kira is attempting to relax in the Promenade area she chances to meet Will Riker who is enroute to Risa.  Though she pretends to be unaffected by Riker's charm she is soon giving him a tour of DS9 and at his suggestion the two board the Defiant for a look.  He casually cons her into activating the bridge controls, suddenly stuns her with a hidden phaser, beams two waiting people on board, fakes a warp core breech so that DS9 will release the docking clamps and hijacks the Defiant.  Before Sisko and the station officers can react the Defiant leaps into warp speed and heads for The Badlands with the intent of launching an assault on the shipyard located there believing that the Cardassian government is harboring a volatile political or military secret within it.
This fine episode of DS9 would have profound repercussions later in the series in such shows as 'The Die Is Cast' and 'Improbable Cause'.  But what happened to Tom Riker?  To this day he lingers in a Cardassian Labor camp awaiting a long overdue rescue.  It makes sense that Sisko would work out the arrangement of this sentence; given the draconian nature of Cardassian justice (first seen in 'Tribunal') he barters with Gul Dukat on Tom's behalf.  But I firmly believed that the DS9 members would attempt a rescue, especially since Kira promises Tom that she won't let him waste away in a labor camp.  But as we all know the series ended without another mention of his name.
One of the high points of this episode is the Cardassian Central Command's War Room that Sisko and Gul Dukat are shown in.  The Star Trek creative team did an excellent job creating the special effects for the displays that the two of them continually consult as they form a strategy to defeat the Defiant.  And when Korinas of the Obsidian Order joins them in the War Room it adds even more intrigue to the affair.  The clash of wills and political views between Central Command and the Obsidian Order would be one of the best continuing storylines of the third season.  Also, Gul Dukat demonstrates that he has somewhat of a humane side to his naturally nefarious personality when he reveals to Sisko that he regrets having to miss his son's birthday.  The two of them share stories about their sons adding a new dimension to their relationship that would be explored over the next two seasons.  Kira's scathing indictment of Tom's sense of a higher calling and her final pleas to Tom to surrender the Defiant to Sisko and Gul Dukat are also highlights here.
Some final notes:  In the ST: TNG episode 'The Wounded' Picard finds himself in a situation where he finds it necessary to assist the Cardassians in defeating a Federation ship that has become a renegade.  Marc Alaimo played the Cardassian representative, Gul Macet, then as well.  Tricia O'Neil, who plays Korinas, first appeared on the ST: TNG episodes 'Yesterday's Enterprise' as Captain Rachel Garrett and 'Suspicions' as Kurak, doing a sensational job in all three roles.",1043539200,,3598,4.6868044515103335

Written by: Ronald D. Moore
Directed by: Cliff Bole
After the second season episode ""Tribunal"", ""Defiant"" was the first to address the Maquis issue, that startet earlier on at season two, in the episode ""The Maquis"".
""Defiant"" is finally an episode, that is clearly ment to contribute to the series as a whole, as it addresses the big political picture of the show.
The episode isn't very rich in the plot department, being more baced on conflicts between characters and the political aspects of the series, being more of a cat-and-mouse kind of episode.
These episodes are risky, because they often end up being boring and uninspired. ""Defiant"" isn't boring, as it carries the wiever throughout the episode, but it is in no means a succes either.
The story begins as Commander William Riker (yes, the one from the Enterprise-D) arives at DS9 to spend a vacation. Kira then takes Riker on a tour of the Defiant, and as soon as they get in, Riker hijags the ship.
Soon it becomes aparent that Commander Riker isn't actually Commander Riker, but his ""evil double"", Thomas Riker, who was introduced in the sixth season TNG episode ""Second Chances"", and who has since turned into a Mquis terrorist.
So begins a hunt, as Commander Sisko must co-operate with the Cardassian to stop Tom Riker as he takes the Defiant deeper into Cardassian territory.
The episode is uneven, with many promising sequences mixed up with some totally irrelevant fill-up scenes that contain clumsy and clich filled dialogue, and don't contribute to anything.
It's also quite interesting to watch two of the worst modern-trek acting talents interact as Jonathan Frakes' Riker and Nana Visitor's Kira have intence, if overly lenghtend discussions on the Defiant. Especially Jonathan Frakes' performance as the rogue terrorist borders parody.
The end of the episode is predictable, but unlike so many other episodes, it leaves the feeling that something has changed.
I only hope the promising premise could have been exploited more fully, instead of concentrating on the quest character from another series.",1008806400,,2099,5.086956521739131
7903073,5,B000003K7J,"Attention Star Trek Fans.  Spoiler Alert: If you want to be surprised don't read this!
This is one of the best action episodes to date. If only Lore; Data's android counterpart joined Thomas in this one!  Thomas Riker; the twin Riker transporter double returns to help the Maquis.  It's fortunate he has the values of his original brother Riker.  He sees he cannot be the ruthless freedom fighter he hoped.  It's not in his character.
I wish one of the Trek novelists would create a story about his time on the Starship Gandi.  Thomas was trapped for eight years and does not share the views William Riker has. It would be a rare and interesting book of about an officer who sees the fleet as an unfair and imperfect entity.",976665600,,724,4.530769230769231
7903074,5,B000003K7J,"This brilliant episode would serve to set-up the two part ""Improbable Cause"" and ""Die is Cast"" that explores a mysterious  Cardassian fleet being created by the Obsidian Order and inprison Thomas  Riker. Thom steals the Defiant, with Kira onboard, and begins what appears  to be random attacks on Cardassian outposts. These soon turn out to be  calculated raids that will make it easier for the Defiant to slip deep  behind enemy lines to the heart of Cardassian territory, in search of a  rogue shipyard. The scenes between Kira and Riker are wonderful, equal to  those between Gul Dukat and Sisko. A well written, fast paced episode with  a great ending. DS9 at it's best.",966729600,2,674,4.850877192982456
