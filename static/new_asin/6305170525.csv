7884130,5,6305170525,"Visitors From Space might seem like a name for yet another really bad '50s B-movie that might get ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it's not at all. This is a UFO documentary from the 1990s from a totally unlikely country: Finland (but translated in English for us American viewers). I hadn't seen this since 1996 (it was rented at a video store) so my mind might be a little foggy here. I tend to remember that it featured some really cool music. I remember there were subjects covered that I've heard millions of times already (that is when they covered American UFO incidents, but is interesting when you get it from a Finnish perspective), but since this documentary is from Finland, what's really priceless is this documentary covers many Finnish UFO sightings and abductions, which is really interesting for us Americans since Finland never gets mentioned in any American or British made UFO documentaries. Visitors From Space did make one mistake. They stated that Stanton Friedman was Canadian, when in reality, he was an American living in Canada. Lately, it seems, that there have been too many documentaries out there that cover the same subjects over and over. You know, alien abductions (particularly Whitley Strieber, Betty & Barney Hill, Travis Walton, Charles Hickson & Calvin Parker, etc.), Area 51, the Phoenix, Arizona lights, animal mutilations, after a while it becomes really tiresome, perhaps because these American documentaries seem mostly interested in just UFO incidents that occured here (with the occasional British, Canadian, and Mexican UFO incidents) so it's nice to see a documentary from a little known country like Visitors From Space come around to give their perspective on UFOs and it turns out to be a lot more refreshing than what the Discovery Channel and the Learning Channel has aired of late. Visitors From Space is nowhere as corny as those silly, low-budget documentaries from the 1970s like Overlords of the UFO (which I happen to like a lot for that reason), the production to Visitors From Space is a lot more professional, and the subjects being presented are a lot more believable. So if you enjoy the subjects on UFOs, but sick of hearing the same thing over and over, try and track down a copy of Visitors From Space, you won't regret it.",1003536000,4,2304,4.940721649484536
