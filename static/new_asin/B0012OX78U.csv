The first thing that must be remarked is the first-class quality of both the sound and the picture for the standards of the time. Secondly, how young and how good were the singers. Rossana Carteri, who makes Susana , was only 26, while Marcella Pobbe and Luigi Alva, in the roles of the Comtess and Don Basilio, were 29 and Nicola Rossi Lemeni  as Figaro 36.  Having a Susana and a Comtess who are both both young and gorgeous makes quite credible the final scene in the garden where they exchange roles. Their duetto ""Canzonetta Sull' Aria"" is particularly enjoyable as well as the Comtess' ""Dove Sono I Bei Momento"", and Susana's ""Deh, Vieni Non Tardar"". Nicola Rossi Lemeni was one of the best Italian bassos in those times and he shows his abilities in the role of Figaro. The same can be said about the German basso-baritone Heinz Reifuss who makes a sensual Comte.

The big surprise is the presence of the Peruvian tenor Luigi Alva in the role of Don Basilio. He had made his debut the previous year in"" Il Matrimonio Secreto"" and in 1956 he made Ferrando in the legendary presentation of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" in la Piccola Scala, directed by Guido Cantelli, with Elizabeth Scwarzkopf as Fiordiligi. It is a real pleasure to see a Don Basilio so young and fresh, who handles  the aria ""In quegli Anni in cui val poco"", rarely sung in that time, with such elegance.",1215820800,18,1433,4.58203125
