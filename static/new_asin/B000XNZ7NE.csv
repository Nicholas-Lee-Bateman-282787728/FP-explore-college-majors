3004570,1,B000XNZ7NE,This DVD is basicly a highlight of all the Superbowls. The problem is you get only two plays from each Superbowl and many of them aren't even the greatest moments. It's definetly a waste time.,1254787200,5,192,4.514285714285714
3004571,5,B000XNZ7NE,"I would just like to say that this DVD is one of the most enjoyable and addictive sports DVDs I have. Relive the beginnings of the Superbowl. Experience the feelings of past glory and see all-time greats play again. For me, growing up in the 80s and 90s it was good to be able to see Joe Montana winning the Superbowl for the 49ers again; the back-to-back wins for the unstoppable Cowboys lead by Troy Aikman; the struggles of John Elway and the Broncos; the winning streak of Brady and the Patriots; and the reign of the Steelers.

This is a MUST DVD for Superbowl and football fans. For those of you who can't keep track of how many Superbowl (if any) a team have won in the past... get this DVD. And for the price that it's selling for... need I say more?",1254700800,5,758,4.263888888888889

8228873,5,B000XNZ7NE,"NFL Productions always puts out a quality product and this is no exception.  It does a great job of hitting the highlights of all the Superbowls and some of the back-stories as well.  If you're looking for a great review of all the Superbowls and don't want to get into the ""America's Game"" series, then this is a good one to pick up.  I'd highly recommend the ""America's Game"" series over all others though.  If you follow any team or just want to go back down memory lane, that's the set to get.",1325376000,,497,4.311827956989247
