8540420,4,B009DQ0V4W,"This DVD offers a challenging program with modifications for osteoporosis. Sherri Benz is an excellent instructor with insightful cueing that even a beginner could follow.  I have practiced pilates for many years and have a large collection of DVDs I use on a rotating basis.  After my recent diagnosis of osteoporosis I was worried I would not be able to use them. Through this DVD I have  learned appropriate modifications that I've been able to apply to my other routines.

I gave it 4 stars because there is a sound quality issue during one section. Otherwise, I highly recommend this DVD.",1401753600,11,593,4.841584158415841
