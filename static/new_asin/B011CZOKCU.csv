7332057,1,B011CZOKCU,"Very disappointed with this movie the language is horrible!
Thought that it would be something the whole family could watch I was wrong
I didn't think with a rated PG. movie I would have to worry about hearing the F bomb sad that people feel the need to talk like that let alone put it on a movie.
Also could do without the tree hugger aspects of the movie also.",1524787200,,362,4.185714285714286
7332058,5,B011CZOKCU,"This documentary on the Mustang horse is so awesome. I have watched this no less than 30 times. What a wonderful story about some friends who take mustangs and travel from Mexico to Canada with these horses. I seriously love this show. Wish my son could have been a part of this journey. What a way to exhibit how the Mustang, when trained properly, can be one of the best horses you will ever own. We bought a mustang 2 yrs ago. And we love her but she has been alot of work. Buy this video and enjoy. It starts out with one of the mustangs gettimg into a cactus and the not so fun job of pulling out the quills. Great great video",1524355200,,631,4.096774193548387

7332062,5,B011CZOKCU,"There are so many pieces to this film. The conservation of horse and wilderness is appreciated so well in balance with the story of young cowboys going the distance and facing interpersonal as well as personal challenges. I was riveted throughout the film on this border to border ride with the horses and the relationship with the cowboys over the terrain how they all become respected friends in the goal of such incredible magnitude!

Watch this and be taken away!",1520035200,,467,4.8375

7332072,2,B011CZOKCU,"Tough to watch because it didn't appear the guys actually cared about the horses; most likely because what they attempted was too hard for them, and the end goal became the focus, not the journey.  Beautiful wilderness video footage.",1516060800,,233,4.9743589743589745

7332078,5,B011CZOKCU,"Horses are our history, we need to give them their freedom in return for all they have done to settle our planet and the USA. These young men were passionate and talented enough to get these wild horses from Mexico and Canada. I would love to see more of the out takes. It's an adventure come true in my dreams.

7332081,1,B011CZOKCU,"Ben Masters is a member of the Wild Horse and Burro Advlsory Board, and on October 19, 2017 he along with the board voted in favor of SLAUGHTERING our wild horses.  Don't be fooled by their claim of overpopulation as the reason.

Mr Masters suggests using fertility control to help keep populations under control, and even notes that it is so easy to do that just about anybody can volunteer to do it.  Fertility control has been available for decades - if it's so easy to use that even volunteers can be trained to administer it, then why hasn't the BLM been using it for the last 20 years?  Well, he fails to mention that the ranching industry has halted previous attempts at using fertility control, and that volunteers in that effort received death threats.",1508457600,2,761,4.614814814814815

7332084,5,B011CZOKCU,"A beautiful scenic journey with wonderful music. It was ""earthy"" but with sophistication and content acceptable for the whole family.

7332090,5,B011CZOKCU,A beautifully filmed documentary that doesn't shy away from telling it like it is.  The only way to see scenery like this is from the back of a horse or on your own two feet.  A very worthwhile purchase that will be viewed over and over!,1501891200,,237,4.130434782608695

7332096,2,B011CZOKCU,"I had expected so much more from this film. But instead of focusing on the horses, there are four young men who seem to look for the self centered adventure after college before the serious life starts. The idea to bring attention to the situation of the wild horses of America is great, but unfortunately, they reveal no solutions, there is no clear message, and the whole intention of the film is lost time and again.  Stupid conversations of alcohol-consuming, irresponsible young guys, quarreling with each other about minor things.
I do not see the point of exposing men and horses on such high risks, the trails they have chosen are just irresponsible.
I just like the scenery and some few scenes. But generally, the whole film falls very short.",1494806400,,751,4.776923076923077

7332098,5,B011CZOKCU,"My kids always dread documentaries but not this one! The videography was great. As someone who used to dream about making a trek like this by horseback, I'm glad I got to live that dream vicariously through these young men. I would not want to go through some of the trials that they did. It was an awesome testimony to how great these Mustangs are. I hope it inspires others to consider adopting one if they're in the market for a horse.",1493337600,,438,4.353658536585366

7332102,5,B011CZOKCU,"My friend and I saw this film when it was released through the Banff Film Festival in 2015/2016. It was our favorite film of the night.  Both of us bought copies for our personal film libraries.  I had my father watch it.  And even if he saw a film a year ago he'll say, ""I already saw that"".  For this film, he sat and watched it twice within one week.  It's funny and provoking while the connection to nature, the land, the horse and purpose are nothing short of inspiring.",1491696000,,475,4.233333333333333

7332112,3,B011CZOKCU,"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this more. I am glad that these guys went through the effort to bring awareness to the wild mustangs that are captured due to overpopulation and who need to be adopted. So...it's definitely for a very worthy cause. That being said, I was personally annoyed by the immaturity of these guys - both with each other and with the horses at times. I feel they could've chosen better routes for the horses so as to not put them through so much physical hardship (mountainous, hilly terrain, etc.). **Pretty sorry of that landowner also that wouldn't let them simply cross through their land.** Also, for much of the film, they didn't really endure nature (or ""rough it"") like I was expecting. They had help driving along with them to supply them with what they needed. I did very much love the sweet older man who helped them. I can't remember his name, but it was enjoyable to have him be part of the crew. So, all in all...it was just OK. Nothing spectacular but I am glad they made the effort to bring awareness to overpopulation issue.",1488758400,,1063,4.541666666666667

The riders take wild mustangs from BLM holding facilities and train them briefly prior to taking a 6 month horseback journey from Mexico to Canada.

7332228,3,B011CZOKCU,"A fun film for horse lovers and trail adventurers, though somewhat contrived. The issues and problems of too many horses on BLM lands vs. the concerns of those who believe they should be left alone was poorly presented.  I was left with many unanswered questions, e.g. why not sterilize; what would be the cost of sterilization vs. keeping horses/donkeys in holding pens;  how many of those kept in holding pens are actually adopted; how many of those adopted are 'successful' adoptions for horses that have spent their life roaming free; arguments for/against culling.  As a pragmatic type who has adopted mustangs and donkeys but who understands that the current system is not sustainable, I felt this was a lost opportunity to present both sides of the argument.  Otherwise, definitely worth watching.",1464566400,7,804,5.114503816793893

7332250,5,B011CZOKCU,"Thankfully, 90% of the content is the story line (getting from Mexican border to Canada) and the bond created
between mustang and the crazy cowboys fresh out of college and looking for adventure. They sell their
message about the plight of the mustang in subtle fashion but powerful nonetheless. The American mustang is
part of our heritage and should be vigorously protected. The west was won (and lost) on the backs of these majestic creatures.
Ranchers need to graze their herds, I get that. But for them that's about money. Conversely, the mustang will give themselves to anyone
that wants them for nothing but simple respect and companionship.

I guess the only thing I fail to see is why the populations can't be controlled to a manageable number through some type of sterility program.
Government ineptitude? Not surprising

 Trail riding a mustang must be experienced to appreciate just how sure footed these horses really are. Amazing !!",1461542400,,946,5.012738853503185

7332261,1,B011CZOKCU,"The very first scene will make horse people laugh: One of our ""heroes"" stands directly in a horse's kickline and tries to remove a piece of cholla from its lip with his BARE HANDS! Could you be a bigger idiot? I am sure they have cactus in Texas, where these boys are from. You wear a glove or use a pliers or your rope or something. And you stand out of the horse's way and give him a place to go. So with such a lack of savvy on evidence from the beginning of the film, it is no surprise that before these boys on their big border-to-border adventure are out of Arizona, they have lamed 2 horses. The photography is gorgeous, but you have to wonder: which came first, the script and the funding or the desire for adventure? The idea that this is about saving mustangs is about as valid as saying a Dallas interior designer showcase house is about helping the homeless. And remember, just like Geraldo ""escaping"" from Cambodia on a boat while his crew filmed him from the Cambodian shore, all those gorgeous shots required an army of crew, who already crossed the scary bridge, scaled the scary mountain...with all the horses that weren't being used that day.",1460419200,2,1160,4.450704225352113

7332264,1,B011CZOKCU,"If I could, I'd give this zero stars.  I am surprised by the high reviews this show received.  Yes, the scenery and horses are beautiful, but the premise is revolting.  A bunch of spoiled, college kids don't want to start their lives and work in the ""real"" world, so they decide to pretend to they are cowboys and drive Mustang horses across the US into Canada.  I had to turn off the show when they try driving horses up a mountain in Utah, forcing the terrified horses over the steepest, rockiest portion of the mountain (apparently these ignoramus' never heard of a ""pass"", ""saddle"" or 'switchback"").  The last horse is so scared that it panics and falls on its side, sliding down a portion of the mountain.  At this point in the show, they've already sent back 2 or 3 horses that they've crippled in their ignorance of handling Mustangs. It is awful to watch these spoiled brats torture such magnificent animals, so they can experience their last ""hoorah"" of youth.  The show is disrespectful to and ignorant of the beauty and wildness of the American Mustang.",1459555200,4,1064,4.657754010695188

Kudos for taking a chance and choosing the mustangs for their arduous  journey.  I admire their spirit, determination, and their obvious affection for their mounts.  As for the complaints here about their lack of knowledge about the care of their string, they did an amazing job on rugged back country that many of today's pure bred horses would have failed early on.  The trust they had in those mustangs to ride on the edge of those precipices, and those steep wild trails, my heart would have stopped.  Brave horses, brave riders.

I appreciate the fairness of opposing views about mustangs that  were presented in the film.  On a personal note:  everyone should be aware that cattle and sheep were here before horses, Columbus brought them on his second voyage.  Horses were brought to the continent later, so the argument that they are indigenous is just false.

7332307,5,B011CZOKCU,I was lent this movie so ordered it from Amazon. As a owner of a mustang I was glad to see something to prove their worth. Many people don't like them usually ranchers and wild life people because they feel the horses damage the land. The horses were here before the livestock. I found some discrepancies on the documenty they tried to blame on the horses that are cows creating the problem. I live in Wy I see cows horses wildlife. I know what goes on for real. I've had horses all my life and my mustang is the smartest of them all. This way a good movie scenery amazing and I hope opened some eyes to the mustangs plight and worth. The survey saying more mustangs than ever is not true I've lived in Wy over 30 years I see the decline with my own eyes not only do I have a long commute to work seeing miles and miles of open country I'm out a lot recreation wise in the miles and miles of BLM open. Mustangs are a challenge they are wild animals but once you get their trust you got it. Cheyenne ran if you got  30 feet from her in the pen now I can't beat her off with a stick. This is a good movie I'd recommend it to anyone.,1455840000,,1130,4.0

This documentary tracks four buddies that graduated from Texas A & M College. They take on these wild mustangs to be their trusted mounts, and set out on the adventure of a lifetime, what a dream and experience. Their wildness of spirit, in both the man and his horse, is quickly dwarfed by the wilderness they must navigate: a 3000 mile gauntlet that is equally indescribable and unforgiving to no one.

One of the top documentaries ever.",1454803200,,315,4.3559322033898304
7332331,5,B011CZOKCU,"All right; we've seen docu's about people who walk the Pacific Crest trial, the John  Muir trail, alone or in a group, but this is a similar docu-movie about a group of young men riding (once wild) horses across the West from South (Mexico) to North (Canada), for reasons of promoting the (fate of) wild horses that are kept in captivity to release the 'burden' on public lands. It follows the group closely, it offers insights into the issues the group wants to expose and promote by means of interviews with experts/professionals in the field, and as such is, apart from providing beautiful images of the American West, also educational. It does not choose a side politically (nor economically), but involves the viewer emotionally, so as to let that aspect guide the viewer to (it's part of) the story.

It is remarkable that the viewer never gets to see or notice any of the filmers/filming that travel along, and is an aspect of the professionalism of the production. Choices for editing clearly are made in order to involve the group dynamics, as there are undoubtedly in such a monumental undertaking, and to underline the human and professional shortcomings of the men involved, as well as their strengths. Although that can be taken as a turn-off for some, in my experience it allowed one to get a feel for the edge that this undertaking was taking place on; there were no free tickets, no easy ways. The men got dirty and the horses got hurt; in that sense it was not unlike (watching) an epic. (I'll leave it to that in order to not provide spoilers.)

For someone like me, not familiar with ranching, horses, BLM, or the very challenging issues all of these are facing, the docu-movie had the effect not unlike a Western, but without the 'heroism' and the adversial nature of encounters (the 'bad' and the 'good' guys), in the sense that it is gripping and provides drama, as well as stunning photography. It leaves one thinking, about the guys, the horses, the BLM, the American West, and not without a sense of awe for all of it.",1454630400,,2043,4.669444444444444

Some of the claims by BLM and The Rancher were definitely leaning anti-mustang.  But I can see the Director did try for fairness and honesty.  All in all it is a marvelous production, one I think everyone should see, in light of the contraversy that is going on about the treatment and fate of our wild horses.

My only complaint is that there is no closed caption, although I saw the movie on Net Flix and that one did have closed caption.  So I will probably have to buy the film elsewhere.

I was on the edge of my seat in the movie theater and shortly thereafter bought the DVD to see it again and share with my friends.  Granted, I am an outdoor wilderness and horse lover so it spoke to me on both fronts.  It was gritty and honest, showing not only the difficulties and joys of the journey but of the personal experiences and voices of the young men.

This is as much a testament to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) wild horses management as it is to the youthful follies of the four guys.

The scenery is magnificent from start to finish.  Wild America still exists in the West.  The is a story of courage, of pride, of will power and a life defining time.  Unbranded is as much a Western as any Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western.",1452124800,2,523,4.40625

There are false claims that there are too many mustangs,  they eat the grass down to the roots and they damage the earth. This is the opposite of the truth. First of all,  they injure the horses by riding them through dangerous cactus. Then they injure a horse's leg. They have no respect for animals. They falsely claim that there are 50,000 mustangs when only 19,000 are really left. Don't support this movie if you want to save America's wild horses.",1451174400,8,513,4.615384615384615

7332404,2,B011CZOKCU,"This was a pretty good movie until the end, which made me think I had wasted my time watching it. This supposedly dream trip by supposedly experienced packers and horsemen is filled with screwups that causes two of the horses to be injured and have to be trucked off, and one to mysteriously die. But what seems to have died too is any real friendship or affection these guys had for each other at the start of the trip, or any enthusiasm for the trip by the time it is over. It's likely some of these guys would have quit along the way if they hadn't raised $170,000 in kickstarter funds to pay for the trip and the filming of it. In a final act of spite, Jonny Fitzsimmons refuses to ride the last mile to the border with the other three. Masters says he felt this branded his goal of getting all 4 guys to ride the entire route from border to border a failure. To me the adventure fizzled and it was obvious all of the men regretted taking the ride and felt little sense of accomplishment when it was over due to the squabbling and the inevitable boredom of spending 3,000 miles in the saddle.",1450656000,6,1096,4.274038461538462

7332408,1,B011CZOKCU,Scenery was as great as the boys and their behavior was poor. The horsemanship was really pathetic because after three months of training the horses were still acting out of control. The boy's ride was supported all the way which allowed them to continue to act like spoiled brats instead of growing up and acting like men.,1450051200,10,323,4.684210526315789
7332409,5,B011CZOKCU,"This is an absolutely amazing story and beautifully filmed. About something I think is near and dear to a LOT of people. The Wild Mustangs. Four young men set out to prove that those horses they pull in off the range and are trying to adopt to the public can make an amazing riding partner. The problem is that 99% of people have NO idea whatsoever of how to train a horse, let alone a wild one, so this was created to help finance knowledgable horse trainers to put in a couple of months on the mustangs so that the more average rider could then take over. It is not only beautiful but scary, humorous  and educating, it is one for the record books. Four young college graduates, 10 wild mustangs, film, and miles and miles of rough riding. They left from Texas and the Mexican border and rode to the Canadian border. The trip of a lifetime. If you are interested in anything like this, you will LOVE this.

7332439,5,B011CZOKCU,"I'm not a big fan of the whole western, horses and cowboys thing. My wife on the other hand grew up riding horses on a ranch. So, over the years, I've seen a fair number of 'westerns' and other media related to horses. And I can appreciate any film that tells a story engagingly.

Unbranded had me from the first 30 seconds. The opening moments are one of those 'whoa, holy cow' moments that are shocking, frightening, and so out of the ordinary/expected that your attention is grabbed immediately. But it's not presented in a shlocky manner with 'Psycho' screeching violins - it's a real moment, and it sets the tone for the whole film.

The cinematography is first-rate. Honestly, when I heard it was a documentary about some guys riding horses from Mexico to Canada, I was expecting VHS grade video. This is in glorious HD, utterly beautiful. I have no idea how they did it on a Kickstarter budget of $170k.

Not five minutes after having finished watching the Amazon rental, we bought it. It's that good.

I will say that the ending felt a bit disappointing - the shots break the 180 rule frequently, which makes it a bit confusing sometimes as to whether we're seeing them before or after crossing the border.  And I while I understand Mr. Master's frustration with Jonny's decision - it isn't a failure when someone else's journey departs from one's own expectations - it's their journey to follow, there is no right or wrong. But then - the whole interval was presented honestly, and that's the most important thing.",1448064000,23,1523,4.667910447761194

7332498,5,B011CZOKCU,"Shows Beautiful Country in West America. Wish this movie was longer. Sad that cricket died. I hope that people can adopt more of these horses! I really enjoyed this movie. Lots a respect for these men traveling all that distance to the Canada border, on tamed mustangs. Wish I had the time, friends, and financial ability to do that. Life just like they said in the beginning ends after High School. After school, comes work. I remember hiking in Washington State just gorgeous terrain. Mountains anywhere the eye can see. To really enjoy the wilderness, you can only experience that by living it. This film caught that moment in life where, it's just you, and the wildlife, your friends/family and companion horses. I hate how people can be  greedy and ruin any land on the planet earth by fracking, mining, etc. As the only intelligent beings on this planet we need to find alternative ways to obtain energy otherwise the planet we hold dear (places) shown this film, will not exist anymore. Fresh air, wildlife will be gone.",1445212800,,1027,4.769662921348314
7332499,2,B011CZOKCU,"I didn't find it inspirational at all. It seemed to be a propaganda movie by the BLM to support their rounding up of horses, only giving lip service to activists who oppose it. One of the young men became a rancher, which says a lot (the horses are ""overpopulating"" because there's not enough room for cattle and horses both to roam and graze, and hence, the choice to round up the horses at a tune of millions of dollars of taxpayer money). We give too much to ranchers, taking away the liberty of these beautiful creatures that were on the land before ranchers colluded with the government to let their cattle roam BLM land. Ranchers gain; horses lose. I'm not sure what these guys proved by riding them from Mexico to Canada. I would have been more inspired if these young men started a sanctuary to let the horses roam free. One guy actually did, and his documentary is called Running Wild: The Life of Dayton O. Hyde. I haven't seen it yet, but plan to.",1445212800,7,958,4.448863636363637

7332566,5,B011CZOKCU,"Warning-This documentary will stick with you like biscuits and gravy! It was thoroughly enjoyable. As horsemen, and general lovers of the western lifestyle and landscape this movie was right up our alley. The wonderful mix of youthful ambition and exuberance, combined with gorgeous ever changing scenery and the gritty mustangs who bravely overcome numerous challenges make for some really good watching! There is a little bit of everything in this documentary....joy, sadness, environmental awareness, the plight of the BLM/mustang population, successes, failures and the lost arts of perseverance and grittiness that so many people in todays world seem to lack as they spend their existence bent over a smartphone. Its good to know there's at least a few real cowboys left who have the tenacity to follow through what they start...border to border. The things they have seen, the stories they will have to tell when they are old men on the front porch make me envious. I for one am grateful that they had the adventurous spirit to go on this journey and also to capture that very spirit and convey it to the viewers. Well done.",1443398400,51,1130,5.01595744680851

7332570,3,B011CZOKCU,"While this film has a noble mission, the implementation of the idea was sorely lacking from the horses point of view.  I expected the four
men to be further along in their knowledge of horsemanship and respect for horses.  Their handling of the horses was heavy handed, devoid of  necessary knowledge, and without the requisite respect the horses deserved.  ""A horse can feel a fly land on him"" and yet these four, although they meant well, did not offer the horses the important feel, proper timing, and consideration they deserved.  There were avoidable injuries (and death) to horses that wouldn't and shouldn't have happened with more enlightened and knowledgeable horsemen/horsewomen.  The editing of the film could have been improved with greater emphasis on the horses: their personalities and perspectives.  Also, the quick cuts in the editing weren't helpful.  Give the scene the time it takes.  There were some scenic vistas which were memorable, but the horses should have been treated with respect and kindness.  Much more to learn, gentlemen.",1443398400,15,1055,5.189349112426036

8724097,1,B011CZOKCU,"These rich kids drag these trained horses, not wild, through the country using GPS, cell phones, the luxury of every reletive coming to bail them out...
They have ac units in their tents, groceries delivered to them, and when they accidentally killed or almost killed the horse they were on, they received a new horse to exchange it. The five stars received were from cast and crew members.
I bet it costed millions to kill a few horses. These are some real idiots thinking they are cowboys.
I just didn't see the propane grill or electric dishwasher.

8724101,5,B011CZOKCU,"Enjoyed this movie because I love horses.
And I especially loved the little burro.
Fabulous adventure and nice scenery, especially in Utah.
The guy I liked the least in this movie?  The person who made the video ... Ben M. was an arrogant control freak.
He f'd up one of the horses because he wouldn't listen.
There's a reason why Jonny wanted to finish the last mile ALONE.
