7861532,3,6304108931,"Yet another made-for-cable TV movie, shot in Toronto, Canada, but set in New York City. No, it does not look like New York City (it never does), at least not to this native New Yorker.

MURDER BY NIGHT is about a guy (Robert Urich) who was found unconscious at the scene of a murder. Now Urich has amnesia, so he can't identify the killer. Detective Michael Ironside treats Urich as a witness, but suspects him of being the killer. Police psychologist Kay Lenz is charged with helping Urich regain his memory. She also becomes Urich's love interest, which is tricky, because Ironside is her ex-husband.

This film feels cheap. A few sparse sets. Small cast. Only one special effect -- a small car explosion at the start (the reason for Urich's amnesia, and the fire on the cover of the video box). Anything to keep the production costs down.

This is the sort of bland TV movie that would only be interesting to fans of one of its stars. I liked this film because it has Kay Lenz.

Apart from Lenz and Urich  and Ironside, the only other key cast member is Jim Metzler. I liked Metzler in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Circuitry-Man/dp/B00005NB8T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Circuitry Man</a>&nbsp;series.

If you like any of the above actors, and you're in the mood for a decent if standard issue mystery/suspense TV movie, you might enjoy this film.",1372032000,,1638,5.50597609561753
