2890744,4,B000SUHOFG,"Enjoyed all four mysteries, none of them are clunkers. Entirely viewable picture on all, but of course not perfect. Considering the film's age and  being mostly b-movies to begin with, I am satisfied with the black and white prints that I received. Good value for the low price.",1442016000,4,278,4.791666666666667

2890748,4,B000SUHOFG,Mildly interesting films from very poor quality prints.  Some films are pretty good and some are laughable.  I particularly liked films in THE SHADOW series.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (ebhe.com) has them cheaper than Amazon.,1435363200,2,230,5.514285714285714

2890758,4,B000SUHOFG,I HAVE WATCHED ALL  4 MOVIES IN THE LAST 3 DAYS. THE SHADOW WAS NOT WHO I THOUGHT IT WOULD OR COULD BE. I WAS EXPECTING VICTORY JORY OR SOMEONE  ELSE. MURDER GOT SOLVED BUT NOT IN THE SHADOW FASHION OF OLD. ONE STAR RATING. A SHOT IN THE DARK WAS PASSABLE; 2 AND A HALF STARS. SLIGHTLY HONORABLE WASN'T HALF BAD. PAT O'BRIEN  AND BRODERICK CRAWFORD MADE ME WATCH . GRAVEYARD SCENE WITH THE FAKE BATS WAS YUK. I CAN'T FATHOM PAT O'BRIEN FIGHTING AND BEATING HULKY AND ROBUST AS ALWAYS CRAWFORD IN A FIST FIGHT; HAHAHA. BUT I GIVE IT A 3 AND A HALF ANYWAY. SHADOW ON THE STAIRS WAS THE REAL HIT ON THE DISK. IT WAS A STORY WITHIN A STORY AND CAME OFF SMELLING LIKE A ROSE: IT GETS A 4. I ENJOYED THE PLOT BECAUSE I WROTE A SIMULAR ONE IN SCHOOL SOME YEARS AGO. I LIKED THE ENDING AND HOPE OTHERS WILL ALSO. HEATHER ANGEL GETS A 4 JUST FOR SHOWING UP. IN ALL I RECOMMEND THE DISC TO ANY BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE BUFF SUCH AS MYSELF... ENJOY...,1398038400,4,937,4.0
2890759,5,B000SUHOFG,"Came quick and in good shape, great movies to watch and let your kids watch good for all ages thanks",1396656000,,100,4.05
2890760,4,B000SUHOFG,"I love these old mystery film noir type movies. I know many
find them boring. I grew up watching this on the late shows.
I didn't get to see many so I started collecting. This is a nice
collection great for a Saturday or rainy night. A Shot in the
Dark and Shadows on the Stairs are the best but all good.",1390089600,2,305,3.935483870967742
2890761,5,B000SUHOFG,I really enjoyed this dvd.....films I have never heard of and I am a film noir buff!!!!! I will try and get some more of these mystery classics...just the thing to watch on a cold and rainy day!!!!!,1388793600,2,198,4.2368421052631575
2890762,5,B000SUHOFG,This transaction was positive all the way around.  The movies are great-I'm a fan of the old black and white movies.,1387497600,,116,4.523809523809524
2890763,4,B000SUHOFG,"If I remember correctly, This is the first of the mystery series. This series is interestig as in many cases, they start off some actors who later become big names in thiends inthe industry. Ths volume is remarkable in that it is the only volume to have an episode of ""The Shadow.""",1380067200,,281,4.423076923076923
2890764,4,B000SUHOFG,Even thou these movies are copies of old new electronics made them clear and especially good watching.  The picking of the movies for these collections is amazing gift.,1379721600,,168,5.0
2890765,3,B000SUHOFG,I love mystery classics on the whole but the volume on this leave something to be desired and when you can not make out the dialogue it is frustrating.,1375056000,,151,4.241379310344827
2890766,4,B000SUHOFG,great movies I bought for my mother she loves these kinds of movies. also loves the BBC movies also.. great packaging and arrived fast. will buy more movies soon,1374710400,,161,4.586206896551724
2890767,2,B000SUHOFG,Poor packaging indifferent print and sound. Deadly mind numbing boring pictures. It was fairly cheap but why bother. I wish I hadn't.,1372896000,,133,5.090909090909091
2890768,3,B000SUHOFG,These are just ok. B movie suspense. Quality could be a lot better also. But if you like the old stuff you might like these.,1369526400,,124,4.0
2890769,5,B000SUHOFG,"I love these ""Mystery Classics"". I have a number of them in my DVD library. I truly enjoy the mystery movies of times gone by. I do understand that the quality of these movies are not always so perfect (and they let you know about this before the movies start), but then again, the price for them is perfect. Each disc holds 3 movies and that means you get a lot of movies for your ""bucks""!! I find myself watching these DVDs over and over. I'm a big mystery buff and I guess that's why these movies intrigue me so much. I would recommend these ""Mystery Classics"" to one and all...and I have and I still do.",1368403200,,607,4.196581196581197
2890770,4,B000SUHOFG,Worthwhile viewing for anyone who is a fan of those good ol' B&W detective films of the Golden Age of Hollywood,1368144000,,111,4.333333333333333
2890771,4,B000SUHOFG,"I love these 1930s mystery movies. This one is very good. The pictures and sound is great. The acting and plots are very good for B movies. The best movie in this set is, ""A shot in the dark"". You will never guess the ending. You get four movies, The Shadow Strikes, Slightly Honorable. This one has a very good plot and Broderick Crawford makes this a good watch. The last two, Shadows on the Stairs, great ending on this one and the best of them all as I pointed out, A Shot in the Dark.",1367193600,,489,4.104166666666667
2890772,5,B000SUHOFG,I had never heard of these movies before; but I love old mystery classics. These movies were great. I enjoyed every last one of them. I am going to order more of these classics. I got this one and another one at the same time and I have watched them both. Anyone who really loves mystery movies; these should be in your collection.,1365811200,,331,4.26984126984127
2890773,1,B000SUHOFG,"Hard to access the films, confusing method; picture quality poor and a couple of films can't even see; sorry I bought this and it shouldn't be advertised. I want my money back for this set. Please contact me!! I hesitate to buy again now here! There should have been a return label and easier way to return.  I'm surprised at amazon!!",1364256000,,334,4.475409836065574
2890774,4,B000SUHOFG,A collection of four films with fairly well known actors from another era. Amongst the actors are  some who became big names like Pat O'Brien and Broderick Crawford in the mid 1950s. the films are quite good mysteries that will be enjoyed by older people like myself.,1361750400,,267,4.680851063829787
2890775,5,B000SUHOFG,"Purchased this item as a gift for Grandmother - she loved it! It had the films she loves in perfect digital condition.
Had a slight problem with the item not being delivered but after making seller aware of the issue - it was resolved ASAP at no additional cost to me. I would most definitely purchase from them again.",1361577600,,318,4.406779661016949
2890776,1,B000SUHOFG,"The movies would have been great, I'm sure...except a couple wouldn't even play & what did, skipped all over the place.",1357430400,,119,4.714285714285714
2890777,4,B000SUHOFG,"Even though the quality of the movie has deteriorated somewhat. I found the stories of all the movies quite entertaining. They had suspense, mystery, comedy and drama all combined. For a avid watcher of mystery/suspense movies I would recommend this collection to anyone interested in classic movies.",1356912000,,300,5.404255319148936
2890778,5,B000SUHOFG,"A great bunch of movies, some of them I have never seen and I love the old classic black and white films, very nicely done and just what I expected. I will recommend this dvd to other classic movie buffs.",1356566400,,204,4.125
2890779,3,B000SUHOFG,"First, there is something wrong with the rating noted!  I gave it one star for ""terrible.""  I see that there are 3 stars provided, and that is wrong!

Two of the movies were so badly flawed (one too bright and both static-ridden all the way through) that I almost gave up, but I  wanted to let others know what I received.  The Shadow Strikes was boring as well as a ""white-out"" film. What I couldn't see, I couldn't hear.  The same willow trees in a lot of scenes were probably lovely...if I could have really seen them.  Very few sets used.

A Shot in the Dark was full of jerkings and static.  Another boring movie. I can't find anything good to say about it.

Slightly Honorable was the purpose of the purchase because Eve Arden is noted as one of the stars, and she's a favorite of mine.  She had about 8 appearances as a receptionist, all one-two liners with a smart remark. I can't imagine why she is noted at all.  Not even a very good cast could save this.

Shadows on the Stairs was filmed on three sets, all in a dark boarding house with boring characters and a supposed mystery plot. If you are a Turhan Bey fan, he didn't do much but try to sneer as he spoke intermittently.  The characters could have been interesting, but they weren't.  The furniture, all dark wooden pieces, would be interesting to an (almost) antiques dealer.

I wouldn't watch this again, and am sorry that I read such glowing reviews from others.  I am a '30s black and white movie fan, and there are so many wonderful movies from that era that there is no excuse for this to have been made for sale.  Just my opinion: don't waste a dime on this quartet of D movies, one of which (The Shadow Strikes) is unwatchable and has annoying static throughout.",1356307200,16,1737,4.375
2890780,3,B000SUHOFG,"""The Shadow Strikes""  -  Granston (a.k.a. The Shadow) wants to find the man who shot his father.  While following a lead on his father's death, he ends up investigating another murder of a man, who urgently needs to change his will. . . .
Picture (DVD):  2.5, many flecks, scratches, light areas washed out, and dirty right edge; that said, it is watchable.
Sound:  slightly coarse, hiss.

""A Shot in the Dark""  -  On the eve of his 21st birthday, a distressed student is murdered with a new invention.
Picture:  2, flecks, scratches, many other defects, top edge: thin black band with white dashes (TBBWWD).
Sound:  very coarse, sound dropouts, muffled, indistinct, and a low, continuous hum;  very hard to make out the dialog.

""Slightly Honorable""  -  Attorney John Webb is flummoxed by the affections of Ann, a love-struck girl;  exasperated by his superficial secretary, Miss Ater;  attracted by his ex-sweetheart, Alma;  in a deadly struggle with a political boss, Mr. Cushing;  and annoyed by the frequent reappearance of a knife: in the curtain, in the desk, or in someone's back. . . .
Picture:  2.5 to 3, some flecks & scratches, top edge: TBBWWD, bottom edge: thin distortion band.
Sound:  slightly coarse, low level hiss.

""Shadows on the Stairs""  -  Sharing Mrs. Armitage's boarding house are:  her chess-obsessed husband;  her beautiful daughter;  her daughter's boyfriend who is a writer;  a long-time friend and wheeler-dealer;  a mysterious man from India;  a bookish woman;  and a curious house maid.
Comment:  this movie plays a trick on you, but you will not know it until the end.
Picture: 3, top edge: TBBWWD.  Sound:  acceptable.

For all 4 films, ""PLATINUM"" periodically appears in the lower right corner (took one point off for this).  Subtitles:  none.",1354320000,30,1778,4.969178082191781
2890781,5,B000SUHOFG,these movies are a dream to watch.  the plots unfold nicely without any distracting sex acts.  a real treat to see familiar actors in their early career,1353974400,,152,4.592592592592593
2890782,2,B000SUHOFG,"Somehow I believe this is a good DVD, however, its organization is confusing.

It seems to be set up as several different movies but in fact I believe they are chapters to the same movie.",1353024000,,187,4.3428571428571425
2890783,5,B000SUHOFG,"Great movies, Remember ""Only the Shadow knows?""  This brings you a great Shadow movie and more. Truly wonderful movies for old time lovers of b/w mysteries.",1336780800,7,156,5.0
2890784,4,B000SUHOFG,"I already had all 4 of these in another bargain mega movie box set. the price here is about what they are worth. do not look for the digital transfers here either.  They are straight from the public domain heap.  Still, cant gripe about the buck a movie costs. they are watchable, no better though.",1332374400,2,298,4.4
2890785,5,B000SUHOFG,"As I began the last movie and the word ""London"" was written across the screen I realized the previous 3 movies were all set in the US! That's somewhat unusual for mystery films. This is my 3rd Mystery Classic and it's a winner. All the plots are complex and there weren't noticeable gaps in the dialogue or acting as there tend to be in the older films. I had no trouble following the plots/action and I liked that. Only one movie, ""A Shot in the Dark"" was kind of hard to understand, the soundtrack isn't real clear but if you pay careful attention you can figure out what's being said by context....again a plus, since some of the movies I've never quite figured out what they're saying! I'm an Agatha Christie/Murder She Wrote fan and I enjoyed each of these movies very much, the DVD is well worth it's low price!",1331510400,2,817,4.417218543046357
2890786,3,B000SUHOFG,"I bought this dvd expecting four feature films staring the shadow. However, only the first film starred the shadow in a passable production. The two films with O'Brian and Turhan Bey were the best of the lot. If shipping/h. was better priced I would give it 4 out of 5.",1331424000,2,269,4.4
2890787,4,B000SUHOFG,"Totally fun to watch..
I think black and white mystery movies are a true
art form because of the nuances used in shadows.
I truly like watching them.",1299456000,,149,4.357142857142857
2890788,4,B000SUHOFG,"A good group of films including the first appearance on film of The Shadow!

THE SHADOW STRIKES - The first film adventure of the mysterious pulp hero of radio and print fame. The Shadow foils the robbery of an attorney's safe. The Shadow's alter-ego meets with a multi-millionaire who is shot through the window, and then underworld characters move in to stake their claim. Can The Shadow crack this convoluted caper?

A SHOT IN THE DARK - Football star is found hanging from a fire escape - a murder disguised as suicide. His half-brother is the suspect until he too is murdered. Everybody winds up in a creepy old mansion and become targets as the killer stays one step ahead.

SLIGHTLY HONORABLE - Law partners are commissioned to get a law passed that will change the way highway contracts are issued. He is nearly killed and then a politician's girlfriend is found murdered. Will the lawyer continue with the case or will he lie low considering he's one of the suspects?

SHADOW ON THE STAIRS - Dirty deeds are underway at a borading house in London: a rash of brutal murders with lots of suspects. The real killer is revealed in a twist ending reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock and Rod Serling.",1297036800,110,1199,4.668246445497631
