After having loved the original series and the direct sequel, I was a little more wary with this, as I was with Tnechi Universe, which was a disappointment except for the final 10 episodes.  The Wandereres however, is a masterpiece and worth every penny.
The love story between Rune Venus and Makoto is a nice change from Ifurita, who easily steals almost every scene she is in with the television series, her character is just brilliant and refreshing.  Jinnai doesn't laugh enough for my liking, and the Bugrum, like all the others are as entertaining, intreging and lovable as ever.  Shame about having no Phantom Tribe, but that would have made it far to complicated.  Easily a 5 star rating.
Though suitable for those younger than teens, it does have some nudity so it may be worth checking first if it is bought for younger viewers.",1009929600,,914,4.58282208588957
7896612,5,6305858160,"el hazard, the wanderers, is an enchanting follow-up to the original el hazard series, the magnificent world.  rather than continuing the storyline of the original series, the wanderers tells a similar but different story from the beginning, much like the various different tenchi muyo series.  filled with comedy, romance, and action, this flick is sure to please nearly any genre of anime fan.",1004054400,,395,5.253968253968254
7896613,5,6305858160,"Most TV series that are based off an OAV fall far short of the expectations of the audience and quality of the original.  El-Hazard was a wonderful OAV that was very different from most others on the market.  When the TV series was released later I was skeptical at best.  However, after purchasing and viewing this tv series I can see that just like El-Hazard it is no average anime but a wonderful retelling of the original story with enough differences to keep your attention and keep the story new and fresh.
The series loosely follows the original OAV with several minor twists.  Princess Rune plays a vital role in this plot and is seen in virtually every episode.  Her character is also very different as she is more of a young innocent girl as opposed to the strong older sister from before.  Everyone has changed a little bit in this retelling, and some of the changes some people won't like.  Most changes are subtle, however, certain characters like Ifurita recieved a drastic overhaul.  While the series does change several characters from the OAV, almost all of them remain virtually the same characters as before. As a note, some characters were cut entirely from The Wanderers.
The key to enjoying the TV series is to realize that it isn't supposed to follow the OAV exactly.  This is a retelling and a wonderful one at that.  There are many additions and subtractions to the story as well as changes to events that happened in the OAV.  The whole Eye of God portion that occured in the original is still there but altered dramatically.  Nanami and Jinnai arguing over control of the Bugrom is another hilarious addition while they removed the subplot about the Shadow Tribe that was throughout the original.
All in all the TV series is definately worth the money.  It is fresh and lively and different enough from the orignal to enjoy without being boring or predictable, however, also it is familiar enough to bring you back all the characters you have enjoyed from the OAV.  While this series isn't quite as good as the OAV, it is a wonderful addition to any collection.  I would however recommend that if you haven't seen the OAV, to watch that before picking up this set.  So if you like El-Hazard or are looking for a nice set to enjoy with friends then The Wanderers is for you.",989107200,,2300,4.62807881773399
7896614,5,6305858160,"I'm a huge fan of the two OAV's (Maginificent World and Magnificent World 2) and other TV show (Alternative World) that all follow each other.  In fact, El Hazard is my favorite anime out there.  This alternative telling of the story, introduced in the Magnificent World, is absolutely wonderful.  There are some major changes, like: it's 26 episodes, there's less (actually almost none at all) sweairng, nudity, blatant lesbian themes, etc.  Ifurita looks different and is not the love interest of Makoto.  That role goes to Princess Rune Venus (who also looks different) -- who got a much deserved character makeover.  In the other series, she was a background character; in this one she is right there as the main character (after Makoto, of course).  It's really a beautiful story with a wonderful love story.  All the original characters are still there and still make this El Hazard one of the best out there.  Everything that made the original El Hazard great make this one great as well.  It is a character-driven anime, and the characters will make you love them instantly (especially Shayla-Shayla -- my personal fav.)  This is not better than the original (although the addition of a love story is an improvement), but it is a better retelling than most other attempts.  If you liked the original version, you'll love this one as well.  Or, if you never watched tho original, you should still check this out...but check out the other version first.",977270400,,1459,4.882113821138211
7896615,5,6305858160,"I'm a huge fan of the OAV's, and I was not sure what to expect, from this series. It reminds me of the difference from the Tenchi OAV's and The Tenchi Universe series.  In Wanderer for those who don't know, Princess  Rune is much younger and is the primary love interest for Mokoto.  To say  more would be telling, but if you like El Hazard OAVs, OAVs2, and/or the  Alternate world, I think you will enjoy this. Another important thing to  note is that the soundtrack for the Wanders series is better. At the vary  least it is much longer .",961459200,3,540,4.287128712871287
