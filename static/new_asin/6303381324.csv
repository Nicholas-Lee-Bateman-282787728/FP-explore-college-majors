7847225,4,6303381324,"this tape is good, it has 3 15min ab exercises.
I won't lie the background, music and the outfits are rather cheesy, but the workouts themselves cover the entire abs.
You get the usual crunches, but are very slow, so it makes them harder!
Each 15min workout gets a warm-up, which i never use, and has a good stretch at the end of each secment.
Tamilee is a great instructor, she is not annoying like other instructors.",1039478400,4,418,4.441558441558442
7847226,5,6303381324,"This workout may seem ""too easy"" but the exercises are extremely effective.  I did one of the three workouts on the tape every other day and really started to see an improvement in my abs.  Tamilee even suggests in the tape that after you learn the routines, ""turn her off and turn on some music"".  This is just what I did but I also wrote down each routine in detail and now I can do the routines every other day whether I do the video or not.  This means I can do my ab exercises while watching TV or when I'm away on vacation.  It is important to do these exercises consistently for the results you want. These exercises are excellent and you can do more reps and sets and work your muscles harder for a tougher workout.  I skip the before and after warm-up and stretch because I do my own routines but the ones Tamilee provides are excellent.  Don't be fooled by the fact that the tape says it is for beginners.  You can work your muscles deeply even if you are an advanced exerciser.  If you could only buy one workout tape for your abs, this is the one to buy.  Tamilee has a very pleasant voice and manner as well.  I also love her tape ""I want those arms"" and do that one regularly, too.",1030492800,11,1195,4.17467248908297
7847227,5,6303381324,I have had this video for several years and still find it extremely effective.  I find the first two sets most fun and easy to adjust to how you want to work that day.  The first one is easier but effective while the second is much harder but also adjustable.  I still use frequently many of Tamilee's abs and buns etc. tapes and they still work as well as they did when they first came out several years ago.,1015804800,3,409,4.151898734177215
7847228,3,6303381324,"This video is good for beginners, but those looking for a more intense ab workout I would suggest buying another video. In my opinion she doesn't do enough reps of each exercise and some of them you don't even feel as if you're doing anything at all!!! However, she's a great instructor so I am going to try to original Abs of Steel.",1014249600,3,333,4.301587301587301
7847229,5,6303381324,"This is the first tape I ever used when I started working out. If Tamilee hadn't been such a good instructor (and non-irritating), I probably wouldn't have stuck with it. This tape gives you a great targeted workout in a short amount of time.",989884800,3,242,4.5227272727272725
7847230,5,6303381324,I have had this video for a couple of years now.  Of all the Ab routines I have tried this is the easiest to use and I got the best results.  I do one  of the 3 workouts each day along with 30 to 40 minutes of cardio.  It works  great.,966816000,6,235,3.5294117647058822
7847231,5,6303381324,"This is a terrific tape!  This is the best abs tape I have ever owned which have been quite a few. (Keli Roberts, ESPN & The Firm to name a few)  I got rid of all of them when I got this tape.  I won't break down a  review since others have but I definately recommend it.",960076800,6,271,3.7017543859649122
