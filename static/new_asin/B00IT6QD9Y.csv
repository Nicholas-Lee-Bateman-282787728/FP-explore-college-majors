6292531,5,B00IT6QD9Y,"British director Peter Book is one of the most respected directors of contemporary theater in the world. To get his actors to work as a team (ensemble), he developed an exercise called The Tightrope, where the actor pretends to walk a thin line on a carpet. Other techniques including having a group of actors count off from the number one without stepping on another actors voice.

This 83 minute film by Brooks son Simon was co-produced by a French company and offers documentation of a Master Class that Book held for a few dozen acting students.

While I love theatre documentaries (and the distributor, First Run Features, as released quite a few), Im a theatergoer (and journalist), not an actor, and so I found this film a bit repetitive and, at times, boring.  But I can see that this would be of great benefit to anyone who is either an actor or studying to be one. Hence Im giving this five stars to attact those for who this DVD is aimed. If you are just an average theater goer, consider this a three-star (Its OK- in Amazons rating scale) rating.

For the DVD, the film is supplemented by a 29-minute bonus  The Balancing Act  which features interviews with the actors  in both English and French  - and a 3 minute montage of photos from the class.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8645222,5,B00IT6QD9Y,"Peter Brook is an incredible director, so if you want to have a moment with him, this is a way to do it.  Don't expect whiz-bang self-help style instruction here however, nor does the video deliver what its like to be in the room with the man, (I know from experience, having the honor to be a participant in one of his director's intensives in Seattle early 2001 during the Hamlet world tour).  He works from such an incredible sense of FEEL, that you can't really capture the full essence of it on video, but you can get a sense of Peter's extraordinary ability to cut through all the noise in an effort to mine that which is profoundly moving in the simplest of forms.  If you're a Brook fan, its a nice peek into the process.",1490400000,,729,4.306569343065694

8645230,5,B00IT6QD9Y,"Theatrical innovator Peter Brook is still, at age 89, exploring new ideas and seeking new artistic heights. His is a career unparalleled and unique in the world theatre scene. For although Brook is born and bred English, he has been based in Paris since 1970. Working multi and internationally, Brook has amassed a resume equally steeped in the classics (most notably Shakespeare and opera) as well as work based on myth and legend to contemporary issues and humanitarian causes.

Long recognized as a revered and respected teacher, any record of his innovative and introspective teaching style is to be welcomed with open arms by performers and directors in a variety of disciplines as well as educators and teachers of drama.

The image of a tightrope is arguably the perfect analogy for capturing the essence of true performance. Part risk, part showiness, part thrill-seeking, part life or death, artists who make themselves supremely vulnerable in performance are those we most admire and love. To accomplish this wonder--and performance at its highest level is a wonder--the artist must realize a level of concentration that is sometime understood as being ""in the zone"". Athletes often refer to this mysterious place where everything seems to come together and one needn't think so much as react to that which one is encountering. It is almost a spiritual place of achievement, always sought, seldom fully realized. Brook's simple exercise of walking the imaginary tightrope, while fully committing to the belief that one is truly as exposed and vulnerable as one would be above the ground without a safety net, is a brilliant way of focusing the mind and body of the artist undertaking the exercise.

The film's director, Simon Brook, (Peter's son) wisely chooses to stay out of the way and let the exercise, the students' participation and his father's commentary speak for themselves. At the same time, Brook the younger manages to be close enough to capture the intense concentration being sought by the students as well as the moments of levity and joy of discovery as the international assortment of performers experiment and give themselves over to working with the Master.

As a film, it is hardly innovative, but THE TIGHTROPE has incredible value as a record of Brook's relaxed, penetrating style of teaching, of his commitment to realizing the art of theatre as a collective experience between audience and performer. Performing artists will ""get it"" a lot more than people who have less interest in live performance. Therefore the recommendation here is for those who will benefit from seeing Brook's approach captured so intimately and simply.

There is a nice selection of interviews with class participants as an extra bonus feature. This helps to clarify the importance of Brook's work to those who are most affected by it--the artists themselves.",1405123200,8,2870,5.137044967880086
