4400990,5,B004LAIUAM,Betty White is a joy to watch.  I had never seen this particular series and it is very sweet.  Betty is a classic and I love her.,1361145600,,129,3.740740740740741
4400991,5,B004LAIUAM,"I first watched this 1950s sitcom on NetFlix and thought it was funny especially the support cast. I then bought this DVD for my parents. They felt the same. What makes this show funny is their wacky neighbors. The Murphys are so funny; the wife calls her husband lover and they both act outwardly mean and aggressive but are actually very nice people. Then, their is the other neighbors The Finleys, the odd son and the aged Father. The Son, is ultra intellectual college professor, who is basically taking care of his aged Father. His father is obviously suffering from dementia or alzheimers and his antics are pretty darn funny. This show is a classic.",1355961600,,656,4.71304347826087

8434055,5,B004LAIUAM,"I originally bought this to give to someone, because I already have several sets of this show on dvd.  But when I saw on the back that it was digitally re-mastered, I decided to open it up and see if there was a difference between this one and the ones that I have.  OH MY!!!!!  Is there ever a difference!!!!  This truly has been re-mastered and is by far the best quality of this show I have ever seen.  So, I have decided to keep this copy and I am buying another one for the person I wanted to give the other one to.
Thank you for digitally re-mastering this show.  I hope that this company does this with all of the old shows.  I will certainly be buying copies of them all if you do!  Thank you again for such a quality program with the digitally re-master.  Please digitally re-master all of the other good old shows too. ....  Life of Riley, Our Miss Brooks, Trouble with Father, Corliss Archer, Life with Elizabeth, My Little Margie, I Married Joan, ect.  Thank you for such a great quality dvd!!!",1469059200,,1006,4.26984126984127

8434058,5,B004LAIUAM,"What a fun little series this was. Another gem from the delightful Betty White. I am surprised that it lasted only 1 season. The picture and sound quality of this DVD is surprisingly good considering the budget price. Some of the episodes include the original commercial spots by series sponsor, Plymouth. Very enjoyable. My one and only criticism is that not every episode from the series is included on this DVD. The complete series would be nice. If you are a fan of 50s classic TV, get this DVD. You won't regret it.",1425513600,,520,4.602150537634409
8434059,4,B004LAIUAM,"I first heard about Betty White when she was on the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  Having seen the Christmas episode 2 years in a row on TV, I was curious to see her early work.

WAIT TILL YOU HEAR BETTY SING WITH DENNIS DAY!",1418601600,,218,3.9318181818181817

8434061,5,B004LAIUAM,ANOTHER DVD THAT I HAD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD AND IT TOPPED MY EXPECTATIONS,1391817600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8434062,5,B004LAIUAM,Both Life With Elizabeth and Date With The Angels provide good showcases for the young Betty White. They have good writing for the '50s and are charming artifacts of an earlier time. Betty's current fans (and there are many) these will enjoy these easy-to-take and fun shows.,1379635200,2,275,4.872340425531915
8434063,5,B004LAIUAM,"Betty White stars as a 50's housewife who has a couple of gal pals that are Ethels to her Lucy:  Wilma & Dolly.  She also has eccentric neighbors, the feuding Finleys & the Murphies.  She is often called upon to be peace-maker between the two, although the results show she is no diplomat, hard as she tries.  This series shows women who are beginning to stand up for themselves to their husbands prior to 70's activism, not that these ladies are bra-burners who label their husbands chauvinists.  They support their husbands & yet hold them to account, while wearing pearls & heels.",1368403200,,583,4.676470588235294
