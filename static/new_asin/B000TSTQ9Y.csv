8210875,5,B000TSTQ9Y,"Big fan of the actors in this movie so it was a very good watch. The cost was unbelievably cheap and shipped from Germany to the US and made it safe and sound. The DVD was unwrapped and the disk looks like it could be a copy, hard to tell, but either way no worries because it played and worked perfect. I was looking for this title for a while and glad I found it. It was dual language so even though this is the German version of the movie it still had the original Danish/Norwegian language track that played perfect. Only downside is no English subtitles but I knew that going in and already found them on subscene and they were timed and worked perfect for this disk....bother 25fps timing so easy as that. It is also not region for US market but no worries again because had to play on computer  anyway to use the English subtitles. Thanks to the seller for having this hard to find title and shipping all the way to the US. ....Now that's fair trade.",1487289600,,957,4.258241758241758
8210876,5,B000TSTQ9Y,An AWESOME PORTRAYAL of Karin Fossum's book: THOSE WHO FEAR THE WOLF.  Many actors you will have seen in other films I have listed  on my Norwegian Films to Watch litamania lists- I have to say that Kristoffer Joner's portrayal of Erikki was incredible!!! I had to watch this on my PC because it is in  Europes PAL format but it was worth watching even on my PC! I thought it was very true to the book! Even though the main cop character was not refered to as Konrad Sejer but rather just called Karsten-- He did a good job as a cop on the hunt!,1268438400,2,545,4.122641509433962
