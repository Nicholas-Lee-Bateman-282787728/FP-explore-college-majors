4714646,5,B0002W1IFC,"I am a hummingbird rehabilitator in the greater Scottsdale and Phoenix areas.  I have been saving hummingbirds for about 15 years.  I have found the DVD of "" Hooked On Hummingbirds"" very
useful in training new docents; and to inform the public at
small meetings. I am most anxious on receipt of the other two DVD's; especially the one on rehabilitation.
  The DVD is a wonderful collection of pictures and information. Thanks for taking the time on pursuing such a tiny subject.",1115683200,7,478,4.7926829268292686
4714647,5,B0002W1IFC,"In my opinion, Hooked on Hummingbirds is one of the best hummingbird DVD's available. Not only does it show almost all North American hummingbird species, it has incredible footage of hummingbird behavior and ecology. I have never seen better footage of a female feeding two nestlings or of hummingbirds hawking insects. It's this emphasis on hummingbird ecology that sets this DVD apart.

  Mr. Kaminski dedicated two years of his life for making this video. And it shows. The quality of the film and organization of the DVD is excellent. Mr. Kaminski researched and consulted experts on hummingbirds to create a well-balanced and accurate understanding of what we know about hummingbirds today.

  Viewers are thoroughly entertained while they learn about hummingbirds. I highly recommend this DVD and give it 5 stars.",1103500800,15,820,5.269230769230769
4714648,5,B0002W1IFC,"This is some good footage folks. We see hummingbirds feeding(themselves and their babies) flying (sometimes upside down), fighting (we see alot of that) and nest building, in this dvd. It is very educational and entertaining . It shows about 20 different varieties. Keep in mind that this is the only dvd available about hummers. If you love hummers get this.",1101427200,4,359,5.0
4714649,5,B0002W1IFC,"I've been watching and reviewing editions of this video since before it went public, and I must say that Tom Kaminski has produced one of the more enjoyable hummingbird videos I've ever seen.  And as a hummingbird aficionado myself, I've seen several!

I've showed this video to several bird clubs in Idaho and folks give it rave reviews!  It is packed with fascinating material that is not only entertaining, it is also well researched. The information here has passed the review of many hummingbird experts, and is something that hummingbird lovers of all ages will really enjoy.

I highly recommend this video to anyone -- from those who study these creatures profesionally to those who just enjoy watching them outside the kitchen window.  You'll learn so much, and will find yourself watching this video over and over!",1095984000,10,823,4.978102189781022
4714650,4,B0002W1IFC,"Hooked on Hummingbirds is a 53-minute documentary about these little jewels of the avian world.  Filmmaker Tom Kaminski combines breathtaking footage in real-time and slow motion with an educational narrative, reminiscent of a PBS production.  He employs unique footage, such as an EKG of a human heart sped up to hummer speed, to provide excellent comparisons that make this DVD great viewing material for a school classroom or bird club.  (Always check with the filmmakers of any film about public-performance licensing.)  I learned a lot from this DVD!  For instance, my body temperature would be 750 degrees if I had the metabolism of a hummingbird!  Mostly California species are shown in the first half, while in the second, eastern species like the Ruby-throated (including one being banded and one that is leucistic), Rufous and Buff-bellied Hummingbirds are covered.  Another great feature of this DVD is to see some rare species such as the White-eared Hummingbird and Plain-capped Starthroat, as well as footage of a few Costa Rican hummers.  The DVD includes a menu with scene selections allowing the viewer to jump to desired segments.",1094515200,10,1148,5.201086956521739
4714651,5,B0002W1IFC,"Thomas Kaminski is a fastidious, precise, nit-picking perfectionist, who also happens to be an artist. That should give you a tip-off as to what to expect from this new video.

Kaminski clearly has been deeply moved by hummingbirds. Close-up footage in slow motion, stop motion, and real time is used to show how hummers fly, feed, fight, and nest. Seeing normally imperceptable flight acrobatics, for example, is more than just amazing: it lets you understand what books can only talk about. Watching a mother hummer weave spider's silk to attach her nest to the tree branch, too, is a sight most people will never see--but here they can, up close and personal.

Not just a technician, Kaminski is also an artist, composing much of the music for the video and either synchronizing it to the motions or creating a mood in harmony with the scene.

Then there is the sheer mass of facts, all carefully researched, and fed to the viewer at a rapid clip--but no so fast that you can't take them in.

I think everyone will enjoy this video--beginners, experienced hummer-watchers, and even those that don't know yet that they, too, can be ""hooked on hummingbirds"".

Here at the office of the Hummingbird Society we've amassed quite a collection of videos about hummingbirds. This video now proudly occupies a position in the top tier.

8476447,5,B0002W1IFC,"I own three hummingbird DVDs, and this one is the best educational content.  This film excels in showing different species, and also slow motion details, e.g., upside down flight, eating an insect, tongues, and hummingbird fighting. Some reviewers find the narrator's commentary annoying.  I agree with their point, the narration reminds me of school films when I was a child ... more music and less talk would have been better, but I do not think the narration a major negative, and the camera work warrants five stars on its own.",1255564800,,531,4.888888888888889
8476448,5,B0002W1IFC,"Wonderful footage of a variety of birds and habitats.  A must for the beginner or advanced birder.  If you love hummingbirds, this is a great addition to your collection.",1236470400,,170,4.827586206896552
8476449,5,B0002W1IFC,This video is incredible and has so much information that you have to watch it several times.  The photography was amazing.  The attention to detail is something that would be of interest to birders.  It shows behaviors in slow motion and stop action that are not seen everyday.,1202515200,,278,4.75
8476450,5,B0002W1IFC,"In my opinion, this video is not over-narrated at all.  The videography is amazing and clear, capturing moments the human eye would never see.  The narration is educational and provides wonderful facts about the birds.  This is a real winner with my 7-yr-old, 3-yr-old and the parents!",1152316800,10,285,5.0212765957446805
8476451,5,B0002W1IFC,"Awesome!  There is just no other way to describe it.  The photography, narration and music are as well-done and perfectly matched as I've ever seen.  I knew maybe 10% of the information in the show, and never had seen slow-motion used so effectively.  You have to wonder how he got those fabulous nest-building and brooding scenes.  A very enjoyable learning experience.  Definitely not for zombies who just want pretty pictures and music.  My entire family loved it.",1143849600,11,467,4.987012987012987
8476452,2,B0002W1IFC,"This DVD has lots of beautiful video and photography, but that beauty is grossly diminished by an overbearing, condescending, and monotone narration that is also too loud.  It would be a beautiful DVD if the narrator would shut up and not insult the intelligence of the viewer.  It should follow the pattern of Winged Migrations using just music and natural sounds and a few subtitles.  Instead it reads like a boring catalogue instead of a beautiful symphony.  They should have had at least one version with just music and natural sounds, and then the current version could just be used in elementary school classes.  There is room on DVDs for both, but the creator of this DVD is not very sophisticated in the art of film making.",1136851200,7,731,4.724409448818897
8476453,5,B0002W1IFC,"Witty, charming, incredibly informative and fascinating to watch-----these are just a few of the ways I would describe ""Hooked on Hummingbirds.""  The photography is truly amazing, especially the slow-motion scenes.  The narration sounds as though it comes straight from a National Geographic program (but with a sense of humor), and the music is perfectly matched with the action.  This DVD conveys a sense of real wonder and respect for these remarkable little creatures, a combination of science and heart.  Speaking of heart, it even shows what a human heart would look like if it could pump as fast as a hummingbird's.  It is as educational as it is entertaining, and I learn something new every time I watch it.  I also like seeing so many different species in addition to the Ruby-throated Hummingbird, which is the only one we seen here in Delaware.  There are rewards for everyone in ""Hooked on Hummingbirds.""  It gets my highest recommendation.",1130630400,25,953,5.025477707006369

8476455,5,B0002W1IFC,"Not the slickest production; but the photography is fantastic! I especially liked the fact that it featured local (So. Cal.) species. So much of the literature, both written and visual, is centered on the Eastern U.S. that it is nice to see the local birds starring.",1129680000,6,266,4.804347826086956
8476456,5,B0002W1IFC,"We just loved ""Hooked on Hummingbirds"" and would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who already knows a lot about hummingbirds or someone just starting to learn.  This incredibly detailed account of how hummingbirds live and how we live with them is just too special to miss.  You'll be treated to ""astonishing behaviors that the naked eye never sees"", experience intimate explorations of hummingbirds flying (even upside down!), feeding, fighting, at play, mating and giving birth, all accompanied by beautiful music, some of it written and performed by Tom's daughter.  The day-to-day account of the young female Ann's hummingbird building her nest, laying her eggs, and caring for the chicks is one of the finest segments of this DVD.  The footage is shot in Southern California, Southeastern Arizona, Costa Rica, New Mexico and Texas, and shows 20 different species of hummingbirds (and many other interesting birds.)  In addition to the western and tropical species, the Ruby-throated hummingbird, which breeds in the Eastern part of the U.S. is shown.  Inspiration, romance, humor, tragedy, and drama are just a few of the elements that Kaminski embraces to make this DVD the greatest DVD about hummingbirds ever made!  If you only purchase one DVD about hummingbirds, we believe that ""Hooked on Hummingbirds"" should be your first choice!",1125014400,18,1345,5.257009345794392
