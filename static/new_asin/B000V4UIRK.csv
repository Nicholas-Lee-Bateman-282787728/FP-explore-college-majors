8216468,4,B000V4UIRK,"I actually heard about this from the Writer\Director James Bonner himself. I happened to meet him at a local hangout, and when he mentioned he was a filmmaker, in my typical LA style I almost ignored the mention (everyone is 'in the biz' in LA, lol), I'm glad on my way out I asked him what he's done.

  That night I had a chance to watch the film on ***flix. My first impression, 'Oh no, it's an indie flick'. Don't get me wrong, most of my favorite films are from indies, but never intentionally.

I told myself I'd watch it for 10 minutes to give it a chance. 83 minutes later, I thought, 'Wow, that was CRAZY!!'. In the first ten minutes I was hit, the movie has very believable characters that do some unbelievably depraved things. If you like sick psycho-dramas, with blood, murder and deceit, you might want to give this a nod.

  Soundtrack was good, and some of the scenes have a 'Lynch-esque' vibe to them when combined with the bizarre uber-snot punk tunes. It looks like it was filmed in Michigan, and seeing some of the run down parts of that area are not pleasing, but add to the overall feeling of the movie quite well.

  The big hurdle for most will be getting over the indie production value. Shot in Mini-DV, all the scenes were set up well and the imagery came across with some great contrasting moments, but it doesn't have that polished big Hollywood look. I overcame that problem by getting into the characters, and I think that a lot of people will get the same result.

I hope I  get a chance to see James again and compliment him on a piece of work that a guy like me can get into..Thanks James",1237766400,,1621,4.348837209302325

8216470,4,B000V4UIRK,"Unlike so many big studio thrillers, this low-budget indie film has a very realistic feel that makes it all the more creepy.  Ed Nahhat comes across as an actual person--not another clone of Brad Pitt doing the obligatory psycho role--and he really brings home the well-founded fear of ""the killer next door.""",1195862400,2,309,4.9423076923076925
