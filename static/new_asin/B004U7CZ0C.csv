8441282,4,B004U7CZ0C,"For the premiere season of the BBC Collected Works series of productions, Herbert Wise directed Julius Caesar in July of 1978 for broadcast early the next year in both the US and UK. He had originally wanted to set the play in Shakespeare's contemporary Elizabethan England, but due to the series constraints for ""realism, he was overruled.

The reason why I used the quotes just now is that like all of the plays in the series, save As You Like It, Julius Caesar was shot on a soundstage, so realism is a pretty relative term here. And while Wise may have been overruled on the setting, many of the rest of his choices pull us out of a realistic telling of the tale: heavy use of voice-overs as well as tight, TIGHT close ups. The first time we see this is with Cassius at the end of Act One, Scene Two, after he's spoken with Brutus at Luprecalia. The tight view of his eyes and his voice over non-moving lips, gives the actor David Collings an almost delusional feel.

We next see the voice-over in Brutus' soliloquy in Act Two, Scene One, and here Richard Pasco (who was the Jaques in As You Like It) uses the opportunity to play with the rhythms and timing of the lines: turning the usual
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. /pause/  He would be crowned:
to
I know no personal cause to spurn at him. /pause/
But for the general, he would be crowned:
And this is a good example of Pasco's exemplary and thoughtful work in the production. From his burst of exasperation with the conspirators later in that scene to his hard work on the crowd in his funeral oration to his almost violent quarrel with Cassius in Act Four, Pasco's Brutus is an active force.

Since the BBC series put an emphasis on using the whole text, we finally get Portias often cut ""voluntary wound"" speech as well as the semi-comic interplay with Lucius at the end of Act Two. Needless to say, Virginia McKenna uses these to deepen her portrayal of the loyal wife.

The assassination is well-done, with single stabbings taking their toll, then Caesar stumbling to Brutus, hugging him for support before Brutus stabs him as well, and from that point on, it really is butchery when Caesar's down.

Antony, as Keith Michell portrays him, is an aging and hard-drinking party boy. His sorrowful speech to Caesar's corpse in front of the conspirators is done aloud (interesting as the 1970 version has that speech as a voice-over). His later soliloquy over the corpse is done as a voice-over, however, punctuated by his audible screams of ""Caesar"" and ""Havoc""... it's surprisingly effective. But it's in the funeral oration that Michell really comes alive. It's not as good as Heston's in the 1970 version (and honestly, I thought there were moments when Michell was doing a Heston imitation), but it's a very strong piece of work.

The production is good, the performances are strong, and the direction fine. You can almost hear the ""but"" coming, right? The pacing drags in the last two acts (where in some of the earlier versions, the play seems to double in speed). And that hurts this production. Still, Pasco is great as Brutus, and as he is, to a certain extent, the audience surrogate in the play (at least early on), the slow later pace is a small price to pay to avoid Robards stonelike portayal in the 1970 version.",1418169600,2,3320,4.579124579124579

8441284,5,B004U7CZ0C,"This is an excellent DVD to pair with the reading of Julius Caesar in class.  It follows the play line for line.  It is a quality production by the BBC with actual Shakespearean actors.  My students are enjoying watching this theatrical performance.  Our school has a large collection from this company; however, they only have one copy of each play.  Having my own copy makes teaching the play easier.  I am a firm believer that Shakespeare must be seen, heard, and read.",1391472000,4,472,4.695121951219512
8441285,5,B004U7CZ0C,"This is a review of Julius Caesar

If somehow you missed the play or the history, Julius Caesar let his status go to his head and is about to take on the role of Emperor. It is up to a handful of Noble Romans to see that this does not happen. The play is about these individuals, their individual purposes and what happens to them after the attempt to stop him. The focus is on Caesar's right arm (Mark Antony).

Displays been brought to life many times down through the years by various actors in various environments. However, this is a unique presentation and as unique as it is can only really be purchased as part of the BBC Shakespeare tragedies set. Looking closer at the actors, you may recognize a few of them from other British films.  Brutus (Richard Pasco) played in over 45 TV titles. ... Julius Caesar (Charles Gray) played General von Seidlitz-Gabler in ""The Night of the Generals""

This was the version, from Ambrose Video, that I used when I was in school. Therefore, even though other versions may have their strong points, this will be the one I equate with the written works.
