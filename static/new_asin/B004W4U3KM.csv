The cinematography is magnificent and the visuals are stunning. Since American Cinema is supposed to be a visual art form, I tend to watch movies from a visual standpoint. Not sure what others think of this film but I guarantee it's worth the money.",1402876800,2,402,4.445945945945946
8444433,5,B004W4U3KM,"Until a few days ago, I had neither seen nor even heard of this *White Reindeer* film from Finland. I only learned about it when I received an email from the Mythic Imagination Institute in Atlanta, Georgia about their special January 14, 2012 screening of it. The description sounded fabulous -- it reminded me of the mystical role of the reindeer in the Norwegian/Sami film, *The Pathfinder,* a longtime favorite of mine.

I'm a long way from Georgia so I wrote the sponsors & asked if DVDs were available. I was told that the French version (with English subtitles) is available through Amazon-France but it can't be viewed on most DVD players in the USA (including, alas, my Sony).

This is a great shame. It sounds like a film that would appeal to myth-lovers everywhere. Sooo, I am writing this ""non-review"" in hopes that it will catch the eye of a DVD firm that will get the rights to it and release it in a format that works here!

[Note: Amazon won't let me post this without a rating -- so I have provisionally given it 5 stars.]",1326499200,8,1039,4.51595744680851
