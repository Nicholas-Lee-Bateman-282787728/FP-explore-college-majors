8633078,5,B00HJD3KRQ,"Great film. Alan has a unique story and perspective on art- he is truly a renegade. He has a distinct vision and almost obsessive drive, something I think this film showcased really well. Two thumbs up!",1431043200,,202,4.638888888888889
8633079,5,B00HJD3KRQ,"This was such an awe inspiring film about breaking free.  The amount of struggle that Alan ""Streets"" has overcome to be able to paint such wonderful pictures just goes to show the power of art.  The fact that he is also self taught is pretty impressive as well, nowadays people pay a lot of money to attend art school but afterwards its hard to actually make it as an artist.  I've heard that just going out there and putting yourself in a vulnerable way is a great way to get noticed, people who go out and do rather then don't are far more likely to achieve their dreams.",1430006400,,573,4.287037037037037
