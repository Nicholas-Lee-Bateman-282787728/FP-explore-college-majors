2535744,5,B000EULK2I,"This DVD on ""The New Medicine"" covers a frontier in medicine where to date we have merely scratched the surface.  That frontier is how the state of mind of a patient interacts with traditional science applications when treating dis-ease.  The power of the mind over body is overwhelmingly important in treating illness, and this DVD does a beautiful job at convincing even the most resolute main stream medical doctor of the value in treating the whole person - body, mind, and spirit.  The DVD is not some wishful thinking episode of discovery, but actually involves credible integrative medical experts who are in the real world truly making a difference in patients lives - a difference for the better that goes far beyond what most people expect to be a good outcome.  As the DVD brings out -- It is not only the disease that a person has that is important, but what kind of person has the disease.  This DVD is likely to encourage a patient, or even a healthy individual, to take the time to make changes in one's life style to live life to the fullest - by taking time to focus on what is really important in life - relationships.  It was so uplifting to view medical students being taught by their seasoned medical professors the absolute importance in searching for and discovering each patient's ""story"" - mental state, life style and relationships, as well as treating their medical disease.  The DVD captured many patient stories of successfully dealing with their disease using alternative mind therapy techiques, in total conjuction with their medical doctor partnering with them throughout their traditional medical treatment.",1176336000,26,1640,4.941818181818181

8114530,5,B000EULK2I,I thought the New Medicine was interesting. I can only hope that doctors will follow the ways presented in the video. It was informative and educational. It was also very inspiring to learn ways to control the mind and to ease the pain and suffering.,1392595200,,250,4.5777777777777775
8114531,5,B000EULK2I,"I am a firm believer of the healing powers of the mind and this DVD reinforces this with actual case work proving it. Often times medical doctors run out of techniques to cure certain ailments and that is where this knowledge takes over, where MD's leave off. Finding assistance like this has to be rare but anybody lucky enough to find it will surely be blessed with cures that border on the unbelievable.",1367193600,,406,4.575342465753424

8114535,4,B000EULK2I,I highly recommend this movie.  It really puts things in prospective for me.  I loved it.  It's demonstrates how important the mind and body connection impacts people's well-being.  This prospective is totally foreign to western medicine but it is becoming more popular.,1349913600,,270,5.357142857142857
8114536,5,B000EULK2I,"If you think in possibility, are curious as to your part in your own health and well-being, this is a good beginning primer.  As Joseph Campbell has said,  'You must become your own hero.'  Not for those who place all their trust in others, but for those who long to trust the intrinsic intelligence of our nervous system's potential to support our lives.",1311206400,3,355,4.603174603174603
