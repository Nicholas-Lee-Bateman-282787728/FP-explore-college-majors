7712465,5,B01DHTWOO0,"Excellent performance by  Emma Watson, Daniel Brhl & Michael Nyqvist! Inspired by true event, its a story that had to be told about the torture prison of a religious cult under the influence of the Chilean secret police and under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The cult is run by ex-Nazi Paul Schfer (Michael Nyqvist), a cult that once you enter, you never leave. This movie is truly amazing! It is brilliantly done and will not leave you indifferent!",1465430400,2,458,4.7974683544303796
7712466,5,B01DHTWOO0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how REALLY good this film is, with standout performances from Emma Watson and Daniel Brhl. Based on the 1973 Pinochet coup in Chile, the depiction of Colonia Dignidad is waaaay past scary! Only five people ever escaped from the prison/torture chamber masquerading as a ""religious center"" and this is the incredible story of two of them!

That Lena (Emma Watson's character) went into the place voluntarily, in order to find and rescue her wrongfully-imprisoned boyfriend is the pinnacle of devotion. The ending will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.",1463097600,8,588,5.061855670103093

7712468,3,B01DHTWOO0,"The movie was an interesting true story about post-WWII Nazis who escaped from Germany in 1945 and ended up in Chile in the 1970's.
I would rate the movie a C+.  But the rare & unusual historical aspects of this true story made worth seeing.",1489795200,,241,4.355555555555555

7712473,5,B01DHTWOO0,"""Colonia"" refers to a quasi-religious cult that persisted for quite some time in Chile. Although it existed during Allende's regime, it really came into its own after the coup that brought Pinochet to power. Then the cult and the Pinochet government formed a pernicious symbiotic relationship. The government sent many of its political enemies into the jaws of the cult to undergo torture and detention. In exchange, the cult leader got a steady flow of people over whom he could exercise power. He especially profited from the supply of young people, both male and female, whom he could sexually abuse.

This tyranny within a tyranny becomes like Dante's concentric circles of Hell. The horror of the place is brilliantly portrayed by the stars of this film. Two of the characters' love for each other is one of the few lights to penetrate the general inhumanity to which we bear witness. Viewers are held in suspense, looking to see if love can conquer in these grim circumstances.",1475971200,,983,4.921686746987952
7712474,3,B01DHTWOO0,"Colonia is a fictional story set in a Chilean cult compound that was actually real (although the movie is a very mild version of the real horrors that went on there, especially towards children which is only very briefly alluded to in this movie with a child emerging from a room crying and the cult leader taking off his shoes to join some boys in the showers).  The fictional story of the movie is more of a what you do for the person you love, sacrifices, risks to your own safety type tale.  Emma Watson plays, Lena a German flight attendant (in fact most characters in the movie are German) who on a four day layover decides to hook up with some cute guy she's met, who also happens to be a public motivator, poster artist and photographer for a group trying to overthrow the government.  After an overnight bedroom scene and playful photographing of each other action to appeal to the fans that want to see their Harry Potter fantasy doing this sort of thing, Lena eventually makes the photographer pick up a ringing phone he planned on avoiding thinking it was his mother, only to find his movement campaign co-workers are all being arrested and shot and that the troops are about to arrive at his flat.  So to cut the scenario short, he's eventually thrown in the back of a Kombi, where he's taken to the cult compound where he's tortured and kept prisoner.  Lena quickly learns the rest of the movement values self preservation over risking their lives to get him out so decides to go undercover and join the cult to find him and get him out.

Colonia certainly isn't what you'd call an entertaining movie, but that's all right movies don't always have to be that if they ultimately tell a good story.  For me it has a few convenient situations occurring for the plot to come off.  Spoilers obviously follow.  Being up to the arrest Lena had been the clearly more intelligent of the two, you were kind of expecting her to come up with the solution of escape, when in reality she was actually more of a burden and hindrance to her boyfriend's escape plans.  I mean you could argue if he wasn't hanging out with her while she peeled potatoes he would never have discovered the trap door but that's a bit of stretch.  Then there's factors like surely as soon as he realises the two have escaped (and they seem to reach this conclusion quickly without any real reason too) at the very least the cult leader knows about the tunnels, so you'd expect he'd put someone watching the exists (trapdoors) or at least put something heavy on top of them. For a place with tripwires to detect someone wandering where they are not supposed to you'd think you'd have a similar system for lifting up a trapdoor.  You'd also think someone would park a car in front of the wheels of the plane, it would have taken ages to taxi out to the runway before taking off, how hard would it have been to stop it?  Even at the start of the compound scenes, wouldn't the cult leader have been a bit suspicious of a girl who wants to join his cult.  He had her passport, wouldn't he have had the German embassy do a bit of research on her, then at least been a little bit suspicious of her?  Why keep her boyfriend alive anyway all this time?  He was a leader, a motivator of people, are you really going to let someone like that mingle with your cult members, even if you do think he's a bit brain damaged?",1474156800,,3384,4.416398713826367

7712479,4,B01DHTWOO0,"The story is based upon how a real-life cult colony had operated....
A truly grim and disturbing story set during the backdrop of the military coup in Chile in the early to
mid 1970's.
The story tells of how 'Daniel' (Daniel Bruhl) and girlfriend 'Lena' (Emma Watson) get caught up in
events at that time when known supporters of the deposed President are rounded up by the military.
'Daniel' did have some involvement he'd helped to produce leaflets for the movement of protest and
becomes one of those rounded up and taken to 'Colonia Dignidad' where he will become subjected to
brutal torture.
'Lena' a air-hostess stays in Chile in an attempt to locate where 'Daniel' had been taken in the hope of
securing his release so they can both return home to Germany.
After locating 'Daniel's' wherabouts she decides to try an infiltrate the compound by pretending to want
to embrace their beliefs and practices.
She will find the camp to be a brutally run regime headed by cult-leader/ lay preacher 'Paul Schafer'
(Michael Nyqvist)
'Daniel' pretends to be mentally damaged by the torture he'd received earlier to enable himself to keep
a low-profile.
'Lena' will find her intent to help free 'Daniel' less than straightforward as she slides into the workings of
the camp unable to find a way of helping her boyfriend and always watched over by the strict and
uncompromising 'Gisela' (Richenda Carey)
Many months will pass....
The Brutal and abusive regime which presents itself as a charitable organisation has a dark secret in the
tunnels below the surface of the compound.
The film is much better than i expected in truth....it is indeed both brutal and disturbing with many scenes
of brutality and torture along with an obvious abuse of children in the care of the religious-cult at the colony.
Several compelling and convincing performances from many of it's cast......worthy of a viewing.

7712484,2,B01DHTWOO0,"A moviezd, thus accuracy to viewer's discretion, version of Chili in the '70s with two intertwined events: The Pinochet military secret service tortures and an ex-pat German colony with supposedly large scale child abuse. With factual events to be discerned the film fails in that the all-important dialogue was fraught with poor enunciation and poor audio level control so if you wanted to truly understand what was happening you needed the accuracy of sub-titles - sorry, too cheap for that.",1466380800,2,493,5.175

8755943,2,B01DHTWOO0,"This is not really a review of the movie which I haven't seen in it's entirety, but a criticism of the DVD. The version I received from Amazon does NOT have any subtitles despite saying ""English CC"" on the box. I am unfortunately at the age where I need subtitles to watch even the movies which I've seen before and kind of know the dialogue. This DVD's main title menu only has the the options for play, scenes, and bonus features. There is no setup option for either the language (which appears to be English 5.1) or subtitles. Because of the accents in most of the spoken dialogue, without subtitles, I am unable to watch it.",1502841600,2,628,4.422413793103448
