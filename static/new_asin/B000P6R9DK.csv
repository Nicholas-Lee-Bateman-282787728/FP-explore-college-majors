8189433,2,B000P6R9DK,"I'm a huge fan of 50's schlock horror. In the 60's the schlock was a little over the top, and by 1970, that schlock I loved so much really went down the toilet. The Drive-Ins were hurting, and some last ditch efforts to revive them didn't help with films like ""Carnival of Blood"", one of those sad trashy exploitation films that signaled the end of an era. The whole idea isn't new, and has been done so much better. The photography is tacky, and the acting is more laughable than anything from the 50's. A slight moment of inspiration comes from Earl Edgerton, in a flashback scene. Memorable is the performance of Bert Young, an Oscar nominee for ""Rocky"" in '76, after he changed his name from John Harris, probably to remove himself from any connection to this overly dismal attempt at entertainment. No surprise that director Leonard Kirtman never made it; Ed Wood had a lot more style.

The reason I bought the collection is for ""The Undertaker and his Pals"", a silly, campy film I remember seeing at the drive-in. It's tacky, yet somewhat clever, and lots of fun. Director T.L.P. Swicegood seemed to have more sense of direction regarding the flow of events. It's apparent that all involved were having nothing but fun. The DVD transfer was also far superior to that of ""Carnival"" (though, if I did drugs, ""Carnival"" might've looked ""cool""). The bottom line is that ""Carnival"" was boring, and ""Undertaker"" held my interest.

The price is right, and I'm glad to have ""Undertaker"" in my collection.",1409443200,,1502,4.729007633587786
8189434,5,B000P6R9DK,"This is a fun one , but only if you like bad acting and gore . both movies are different I like the Undertaker one better , but I'd say it's a good disc if your a horror comedy fan !",1401753600,,182,3.4634146341463414
8189435,4,B000P6R9DK,"My dad remembered this film (The Undertaker and His Pals) from his childhood so he made me order this for him. He enjoyed it as a kid, but when he watched this with me, he felt the same way I did. The film was sort of a joke compared to some horror movies that were out during that time frame. However, it does have a great story line. Recommended to watch at least once.",1323475200,,371,4.027027027027027
8189436,3,B000P6R9DK,"Typically Alpha gives you inferior picture quality.  UNDERTAKER AND HIS PALS is Ok and the movie is enjoyable.  Haven`t watched carnival yet, but did check for picture quality which is not the best.",1266364800,2,198,4.96969696969697
8189437,5,B000P6R9DK,"My attention was drawn to this DVD because the heretofore difficult to find, ""Undertaker and His Pals,"" is immortalized in the seminal ""Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film"" with a large photo of its movie poster making it required viewing. This movie is a mildly entertaining HG Lewisesque 60s gore film about the title characters killing beautiful women to drum up business for the undertakers and provide meat for the restaurant run by the pals. There is lots of black humor (after killing Mary Lamb, the menu lists ""leg of lamb"" as the special), but it's not that funny, and even clocking in at 60 minutes, the movie still seems about twice, no make that three times as long as it should be. The one saving grace is the women in the movie really are quite beautiful given the financial constraints the filmmakers obviously had (no nudity). If you don't know HG Lewis, then you probably don't need to worry about seeing this movie.

The second film, ""Carnival of Blood,"" is much better. It's a throw-away story about a killer at Coney Island in NY, and it was filmed on location in 1970. It was really fascinating to see the amusement park at this time, and the characters in the movie, although they were generally complaining and bickering (it's NY for cryin' out loud), were a pretty interesting group of people. This one was around 1:30 and I was entertained from beginning to end. Also, a sound clip from this film is contained in the 1985 7"" EP by punk sensations, The Blood Farmers, and I was glad to have found its source.

There is also a bonus feature, ""Coney Island USA,"" which is a roughly 0:15 sparsely narrated documentary on the park, and there are about 0:30 of trailers including ""The Corpse Grinders,"" ""Blood Orgy of the She Devils,"" and ""The Doll Squad,"" which should be of interest to 70s grindhouse fans.

All entries in this DVD are full screen, but the image itself did not feel particularly confined. The colors were washed out for ""Undertaker and His Pals,"" and the image was grainy for ""Carnival of Blood,"" but neither of these flaws was big enough of a problem to hamper viewer enjoyment.

I regard this DVD as a bargain for grindhouse connoisseurs.",1195257600,16,2176,4.68848167539267
