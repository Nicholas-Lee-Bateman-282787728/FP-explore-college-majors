3099420,4,B0012XIGXC,"""Gangland: The Complete Season One (2007)"", 4 disc set, A&E Home Video, Dist. by NEWVIDEO.  ISBN 1-4229-0949-2. English, Color, 611 min.

This 4 disc DVD set provides more than 611 min. (extras)of over 10 hrs. of color video, mostly excellent quality footage, with narrated soundtrack and much original recordings of gang members, police and victims interacting.  Each disc contains 3 to 4 topics dealing with Gangland culture and these include American Gangster Harlem, You Rat-You Die (MS-13), Mexican Mafia & LA County, Hells Angels, Race Wars (Latino vs Afro-American, Kings of New York, Chicago's Black P. Stones, Skinheads, Chicago's Ganster City, La Nuestra (Blood In-Blood Out), Basic Training (USAF skills), Blood Oath (Racism), Root of All Evil (100,000 member MS-13 in America).

Overall, this compendium of gangland footage is especially meaningful if you've had basic introduction into the culture of gangs via more recent publications as ""A World of Gangs"", The Gangs of Los Angeles"" or ""The Mexican Mafia"" and are familiar with the deep-seated cultural aspects of street and prison gangs: their codes, signing, dress style, graffito, ghettos, rap music, drugs, and their allegiances.

Interestingly, if one were to confines one's knowledge of gangs to what is available in the press or radio, one would be almost totally uninformed and misinformed and naive on the subject. These DVDs are not a substitute for researched books on gangs but is a satisfying complement - and we are privy to seeing the youthfulness of its members, 'signing' of gangs, phlethora of tattoos and ghetto conditions that often, but not always, precedes gangland activity. There is some erratic edition of certain film clips which leads to some redundancy, but overall this is a relatively minor fault, but caused me to drop it by one star in rating.",1222560000,18,1840,5.223728813559322

3099429,5,B0012XIGXC,"In rewatching episode one, I couldn't help noticing analogies to the first 'Lethal Weapon' episode.  More great stories follow, like the Cuban who takes over the Latin Kings, and the Chicago highrise war zone buildings.  I mean these stories are just phenomenal!

But, I enjoy this stuff for something more; they're great windows on the beginnings of human culture.  Did you think that our Caveman ancestors and Homo Erectus who first discovered fire were peace loving people?  Know, they scratched and clawed their way through life.  And, I theorize that they formed gangs.  They rarely ever formed any kind of Democracy. Not that democracy is a perfect solution to anything.  Democracy actually proves inversely that gangs don't reason.

I also am making a analogy between cults, gangs, and religions.  Religions are just bigger cults, and cults are just gangs who have made their ruler divine somehow.",1392336000,,904,5.13013698630137

The hook for me was that I know so little about career criminals and the world of gangs. It's the same old story for most of it -- money, jealousy, paranoia, power, and drugs -- but is satisfying in that they always get busted, and the how is always interesting.",1376006400,,402,4.373333333333333

3099441,5,B0012XIGXC,"I 'm from a small country town who had to move to a large metropolis decades ago just to find work and raise a family. Gradually, I've watched the gang situations and crime and violence get worse over time. With different kinds of ethnic gangs popping up everywhere. This series allows ""normal "" people the chance to finally learn something about the origins, tactics, beliefs, etc. about various gangs. The series has interviews with current and former gang members, as well as law enforcement.  It also gets very bloody and pulls no punches. Be warned! This series is adult material. If my son was still a teenager living at home I would make him watch this series to warn him. The show itself sometimes has background noise and music that occasionally make it difficult to hear what people are saying. I am grateful that such a show exists for regular people to learn about the gangs in their neighborhood. Highly recommended!!!!!!",1371945600,,934,4.801242236024844

3099445,1,B0012XIGXC,"Well after watching this box set from a friend of mine , and going though dozens of gang profiles. I did not see anything new or different with each , i live in a gang area myself with my little latino town surrounded by 6 gangs and they are the same , nothing new other than how they spray paint there gang names.

99% of these ""bangers"" or former ""bangers"" are a bunch of clowns in the lest , excuses , excuses for there troubles and shift the blame to everyone but themselves.
Three words ""Get A Job"" , simple. At least try. And after watching all of them , only 2 had asian gangs , 5 skin head gangs , 9 bikers clubs , and  dozens of black or latino gangs. No one can tell me  that the national crime rate is not done by a minority or the whites.

Horrible series and a waste of time to spend money on it.",1366502400,,809,3.9447852760736195

3099448,1,B0012XIGXC,"I watch this show because I haven't found a better source yet for reading about prison gangs. Pacing sucks, its obviously sensationalist, and it doesn't open up any honest critique for the prison system, cops, or racial tension.",1364169600,,228,5.026315789473684

3099450,4,B0012XIGXC,This is one of those shows that you sit in front of the TV and think you are going to watch 5 -10 minutes. Then the next thing you know the show is over. Then you want to watch the next episode.,1362355200,,194,3.642857142857143

3099452,1,B0012XIGXC,"The poor rating is due to the inaccurate description of the episode.  Gangland, season one, episode 13 is advertised as ""The Hells Angels are the most powerful and well-known biker club on the planet, boasting over 2500 members.""  In fact, the episode is about MS-13, the Mara Salvatrucha.  I'm not the first to have found this out and I'm surprised that Amazon hasn't corrected it yet.  However, instead of griping to everyone I know (I'm a huge fan of Amazon), I'm going to contact Customer Service and see if we can get this fixed.  Hopefully I can come back shortly and change my review to one praising Amazon's swift response and correction of this minor error.",1339545600,2,666,4.706896551724138
3099453,5,B0012XIGXC,"Very well made series. Each episode is focused on a different gang, inclusing interviews from current members, former members, aswell as the law enforcement agencys attached to investigating that gang. Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season. I grew up in a very gang dominated city and throught i knew a fair ammount about gangs, apparently i was wrong. This series is a definate eye-opener.",1325980800,,851,4.3584905660377355

3099455,5,B0012XIGXC,"I saw some episodes of this on The History Channel...
Then I found the whole series on DVD.

...This is a collection of short documentaries featuring all manner of criminal gangs that infect OUR NATION like a foul disease. The presentation is a bit flambouyant and sensational, but its all based on ACTUAL EVENTS in the news. There is a plentiful array of actual film of these dregs, ...mostly surveillance-camera or police-footage, ...or the even film taken from the gangs as evidence. Yes, they are stupid enough to film their own crimes!

I follow the news rather closely, wherever I've lived, and the SAME type of people stand out REPEATEDLY, week after week. Its no longer ""shocking"", in regard to the particularly vile crimes they commit, but its STILL outrageous. Most people tend to ignore it, ...and thats stupid. Be aware of whats moving into YOUR neighborhood.

In general, the ""people"" featured here are just tattoo-encrusted ghetto-garbage and trailer-trash. These inferior and atavistic specimens of ""humanity"" are merely the feces of the species, nothing more. They generally target ONLY DEFENSELESS VICTIMS. Anyone who has had to deal directly with this particularly vulgar element realizes that NONE of them are really ""tough"", ...especially when its one-against-one. There is a reason that such ""people"" congregate in numbers, ...they are simply depraved cowards who need the safety of the herd.

A sample of whats on Disc #1:
-Two dirt-bags became the biggest heroin-dealers in New York City in the 1970s, ...mainly Harlem. The locals regarded these two degenerates as ""heros"", ...you know, the guys who became wealthy by exploiting their own neighbors by feeding their drug-addictions.
-MS-13: Theres lots of footage of these disgusting tattooed-pukes, strutting around, pretending to be ""tough"". Apparently they like to hang around without shirts on, and show off their scrawny, girly arms. They look rather gay...
They are present in at least 48 states, and are commiting a large number of the rapes, assaults, robberies, and murders in your area.
-The ""mexican mafia"": Another group of ""tough guys"" from south of the border. Closely affiliated with MS-13, they prove how ""tough"" they are by murdering women and children. In this episode, they shot a baby in the face.
-Motor-cycle gangs: Mainly concerned with fighting over territory to sell drugs and stolen property, ...or conflicts over ""logos"". Basically a bunch of shaggy, unwashed, adult-adolescents on motor-cycles, they largely seem to be entertained by killing and maiming others like themselves. They largely ignore the general populous. However, these are by far the most dangerous predators out there, even individually. Many of them have prior military affiliation, and some are combat-veterans. There is a reason why all the other gangs are afraid of them. The fact that they prey mostly on other criminals makes them the least contemptible in the menagerie.",1316044800,7,2945,5.259574468085106
3099456,5,B0012XIGXC,"i was very skeptical about purchasing used dvds but after a long concideration i went for it and was pleasently surprised at the overall condition of the dvd series.i exspected scratches and skipping,the dvds are in perfect condition not a single scratch or skip.the first owner took good care of the dvds.",1301702400,,306,4.903846153846154
3099457,5,B0012XIGXC,"Gave this for a gift and I get thank you's every day, so I definitely recommend it.  It was not my type of viewing but after watching it I found it very interesting and informative. I enjoyed it and He LOOOOOVED it.",1294963200,,215,4.119047619047619
3099458,3,B0012XIGXC,"Gangland: Season One is probably a kind of acquired taste, for
those fascinated with power structures, cliques, clans, the
underworld, criminology and generally, what occurs on the streets,
in the biggest, most densely populated and immigrant concentrated
areas of the USA.

Having sampled just a few of the episodes of this season, the
release is impressive, from its brief yet well researched, fact
based narrative.

The episode on the Eme is an example, reminiscent significantly of
Olmos's American Me. With a growth based out of a Juvenile Hall
reformatory, expanding to Fulsom Penn, then to other ones, such as
Pelican Bay, and others in California, the eme dozens of thousands
of members.

The episode suggests that 90% of the leadership is located behind
bars,  carrying out life terms without parole, managing to control
from afar all street member behavior, operations, and reprimands
keeping members and rivals in line.

What most people don't know, or realize or want to hear, is the
outcome of an individual being pigeon-holed in underground
activity, and adopting a criminal mind and career, is perhaps a
loss of all hope in joining what most would consider a normal life,
as shown by the  mainstream population with a legit occupation. T

This is extraordinarily serious, for the simple reason that once a
member joins, only death can take that person away, never divorce,
separation, lack of interest, boredom, frustration, annoyance with
the group, etc.

Extortion is commonplace and profitable, not only in neighborhoods,
the streets being organized into territories, but also cell blocks
in jails, each having a designated ""bloquero"" or gang member whose
role is to collect money from protection rackets. This is not a
small role, as over 50,000 gang members hierarchically in one form
or another, respond to the eMe.

Symbolism, artwork, Aztec culture is a leveraged for identity and
pride purposes through tattoos and dialects. Unlike some monarchies
of the past, there is no room  for comedy, self criticism or a
joker telling inconvenient truths.

A controversial statement is made, such as having a target play
basketball to get his blood moving and later bleed and die faster
upon a shank wound etc.

Surveillance video footage, the witness protection program, members
rolling over, confidential informants,  lock down are some tools
used to fight against the underground made up of members, known as
carnales by the system.

At the same time, valuable lessons are learned in day to day
conduct, for anyone in any small business or major corporation,
which is the requirement for a total allegiance, respect to
leadership and clan image, as well as an omerta about the
day-to-day goings on in the clique. Information is power, worth
money, secrecy often the key to success in face of the system,
anarchists, delinquents and rivals.

Another lesson, is the careful hiring policy into the gang, by
virtue of the member needing to add to the gang from a reputation,
image, prestige and an ability to exert fear and intimidation on
others, for profits, and diminish the dependency on the ""muscle"".
Skimming profits off sales, or pocketing cash that is unearned,
carries a death sentence by those involved.",1266451200,,3226,5.129770992366412
3099459,3,B0012XIGXC,Season Two is much better.  It took awhile for shipping even though it was expedited.,1265760000,,85,4.666666666666667
3099460,5,B0012XIGXC,"I have watched every episode of this series (thank you DVR!) since its inception.  I find it to be one of the more compelling documentaries on television today.  I have purchased all seasons thus far released on DVD and will continue to do so until the series ends.

Each episode is well-researched and presents points-of-view from within the gang, as well as law-enforcement.  If you didn't think gangs were much of a problem, this series may change your mind ... gangs are EVERYWHERE.

Although I am sure that there are some who would view this program as a glorification of gang-life, I strongly disagree.  The brutal and tragic truth behind all the gangs presented clearly illustrate a warning of the insidious nature of gang-life.

Although the MTV-like presentation of the subject matter can be abrasive (especially the repetitious ""arrrrgggghh"" that infests each and every episode), the format could be meant to induce younger viewers to watch the show.  What makes this series so interesting is that it focuses on all gangs, not just those that have been highlighted by the media over the years (Bloods, Crips, Hells Angels, etc.) ... prison gangs, outlaw motorcycle gangs, inner-city gangs, white-supremacy gangs ... this series covers them all in manner that is hard to ignore.",1260403200,2,1287,5.037735849056604
3099461,2,B0012XIGXC,"I am a huge fan of any reality shows about criminals or crime, I was so disappointed with this show, I feel like the producers just wanted to make a full season any way they can.

Most of the episodes are a pure joke, these so called gangs are nothing more than a bunch of teen high school drop outs waving gang signs and driving around in $200 dollar cars but the producers somehow thought they should dedicate a full episode to those losers.

Most of the characters are a joke, I couldn't stop from laughing when I was watching some of these clowns lecturing there ideals infront of the camera, truly the highest moment in there lives.

I'd say maybe 2 or 3 episodes are watchable , the American gangster and the Arian brotherhood thats about it, the rest are just pure garbage, I recommend MSNBC Lock Up.",1259884800,4,807,4.402684563758389

3099463,5,B0012XIGXC,"This is an amazing collection.  It really gets you into the inner workings and mindsets of those involved in gangs and gang activities. If you have children, work with children, impact a child's life in any way, it will definitely makes you think about how you interact with them. Gangs are born out of the need for love and acceptance.  Not permissive behavior with no discipline, even the gangs have discipline. I can't wait to purchase the rest of the series.",1253664000,,462,4.691358024691358
3099464,5,B0012XIGXC,This series is great!!! I would definitely suggest getting all 4 seasons....and the rest when they are available.,1252281600,,113,5.333333333333333
3099465,3,B0012XIGXC,"The series is interesting in that it shows a life that most viewers have little idea about.  The interviews with involved members, both inside and outside of prison paints a grim picture of the lifestyle that is tough to live but easy to glamorize.

When I watched the first season DVDs over a weekend I really began to notice the repeated use of some stock footage and audio.  I realize that in a ""documentary"" style often they have to stretch still photos into moving images and use sound effects to liven things up but I think some are overused.  I don't remember it being bothersome when episodes are watched individually over a longer period of time however so depending on your viewing habits you might not be bothered.

Many of the gangs are simply copy-cats of each other and therefore some of the episodes became rather blahh as a result.  I would have rather had an episode or two on generic gang topics like how they acquire weapons and drugs to perhaps tags and symbology interpreted for a change of pace.  As it is this series is sort of like a Who's-Who index of gangs rather than a look at the broader picture and what traits many of these groups share and why.",1242000000,8,1176,4.492957746478873

3099468,5,B0012XIGXC,"My husband absolutely loves this show.  I bought him the first season and have the second season on pre-order for him.  He watches this on TV, but wanted the DVDs to go back and re-watch.  He keeps up on stuff like this and is often found watching CNN and other news stations to keep up on what is happening locally and internationally.  Again, he loves this show and can't wait for future seasons.  Great information, and definetly an eye opener for anyone who wants to know what is happening around them.",1227312000,,506,4.516483516483516
3099469,2,B0012XIGXC,"Whatever informative or educational value this program could have had is utterly demolished by the disgusting over-use of one sound effect; a generic one used billions of times before in video games, TV, and movies, of a male voice going ""AAAARGH!"" which is played as much as possible, as often as possible, over and over and over and over and over and over again.

For reference, the sound effect sounds a lot like Charlie Brown going ""AAAGH!"" with his head straight up so his mouth opens up massively.

In between scene shifts, from showing pictures to showing interviews to showing footage to showing ANYTHING, this aggravating sound effect is played, to a point where the series becomes simply unwatchable.  It is unwatchable.  And all because of one stupid sound effect played several dozen times per episode.",1224979200,2,814,4.963235294117647
3099470,5,B0012XIGXC,"I saw a few episodes when it first started on the HD version of The History Channel. The first episode I ever saw was called ""Kings Of New York"" and it was on the Latin Kings street gang that originated out of the midwest and spread to New York.

The things that I saw in that special I can't print here! As terrifying as it was to me, I couldn't stop watching. I've seen other episodes of this series and it reveals things about gangs that I never knew. If all you think of street gangs is a bunch of hoodlums with no intelligence and are just troublemakers, then I would DOUBLY recommend this series! While this series won't change the world, it'll make you have a better prespective of what these gangs are about. I've seen horror movies that weren't as scary as the things shown here.

I will say up front it does contain language and some disturbing scenes so if you are the Bible thumping type or if you get offended easily, then don't watch this series. Kind of sad in a way though since some of the information revealed here could actually save a life!

Anyway, great series but not for the weak of heart.",1223510400,8,1113,4.315789473684211

Each disc contains 3 to 4 topics dealing with Gangland culture and these include American Gangster Harlem, You Rat-You Die (MS-13), Mexican Mafia & LA County, Hells Angels, Race Wars (Latino vs Afro-American, Kings of New York, Chicago's Black P. Stones, Skinheads, Chicago's Ganster City, La Nuestra (Blood In-Blood Out), Basic Training (USAF skills), Blood Oath (Racism), Root of All Evil (100,000 member MS-13 in America).

Overall, this compendium of gangland footage is especially meaningful if you've had basic introduction into the culture of gangs via more recent publications as ""A World of Gangs"", The Gangs of Los Angeles"" or ""The Mexican Mafia"" and are familiar with the deep-seated cultural aspects of street and prison gangs: their codes, signing, dress style, graffito, ghettos, rap music, drugs, and their allegiances.

Interestingly, if one were to confines one's knowledge of gangs to what is available in the press or radio, one would be almost totally uninformed and misinformed and naive on the subject. These DVDs are not a substitute for researched books on gangs but is a satisfying complement - and we are privy to seeing the youthfulness of its members, 'signing' of gangs, phlethora of tattoos and ghetto conditions that often, but not always, precedes gangland activity. There is some erratic edition of certain film clips which leads to some redundancy, but overall this is a relatively minor fault, but caused me to drop it by one star in rating.",1222560000,18,1840,5.223728813559322

But, I enjoy this stuff for something more; they're great windows on the beginnings of human culture.  Did you think that our Caveman ancestors and Homo Erectus who first discovered fire were peace loving people?  Know, they scratched and clawed their way through life.  And, I theorize that they formed gangs.  They rarely ever formed any kind of Democracy. Not that democracy is a perfect solution to anything.  Democracy actually proves inversely that gangs don't reason.

I also am making a analogy between cults, gangs, and religions.  Religions are just bigger cults, and cults are just gangs who have made their ruler divine somehow.",1392336000,,904,5.13013698630137

The series has interviews with current and former gang members, as well as law enforcement.  It also gets very bloody and pulls no punches. Be warned! This series is adult material. If my son was still a teenager living at home I would make him watch this series to warn him.

99% of these ""bangers"" or former ""bangers"" are a bunch of clowns in the lest , excuses , excuses for there troubles and shift the blame to everyone but themselves.
Three words ""Get A Job"" , simple. At least try. And after watching all of them , only 2 had asian gangs , 5 skin head gangs , 9 bikers clubs , and  dozens of black or latino gangs. No one can tell me  that the national crime rate is not done by a minority or the whites.

Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season.

3333952,5,B0012XIGXC,"I saw some episodes of this on The History Channel...
Then I found the whole series on DVD.

...This is a collection of short documentaries featuring all manner of criminal gangs that infect OUR NATION like a foul disease. The presentation is a bit flambouyant and sensational, but its all based on ACTUAL EVENTS in the news. There is a plentiful array of actual film of these dregs, ...mostly surveillance-camera or police-footage, ...or the even film taken from the gangs as evidence. Yes, they are stupid enough to film their own crimes!

I follow the news rather closely, wherever I've lived, and the SAME type of people stand out REPEATEDLY, week after week. Its no longer ""shocking"", in regard to the particularly vile crimes they commit, but its STILL outrageous. Most people tend to ignore it, ...and thats stupid. Be aware of whats moving into YOUR neighborhood.

In general, the ""people"" featured here are just tattoo-encrusted ghetto-garbage and trailer-trash. These inferior and atavistic specimens of ""humanity"" are merely the feces of the species, nothing more. They generally target ONLY DEFENSELESS VICTIMS. Anyone who has had to deal directly with this particularly vulgar element realizes that NONE of them are really ""tough"", ...especially when its one-against-one. There is a reason that such ""people"" congregate in numbers, ...they are simply depraved cowards who need the safety of the herd.

A sample of whats on Disc #1:
-Two dirt-bags became the biggest heroin-dealers in New York City in the 1970s, ...mainly Harlem. The locals regarded these two degenerates as ""heros"", ...you know, the guys who became wealthy by exploiting their own neighbors by feeding their drug-addictions.
-MS-13: Theres lots of footage of these disgusting tattooed-pukes, strutting around, pretending to be ""tough"". Apparently they like to hang around without shirts on, and show off their scrawny, girly arms. They look rather gay...
They are present in at least 48 states, and are commiting a large number of the rapes, assaults, robberies, and murders in your area.
-The ""mexican mafia"": Another group of ""tough guys"" from south of the border. Closely affiliated with MS-13, they prove how ""tough"" they are by murdering women and children. In this episode, they shot a baby in the face.
-Motor-cycle gangs: Mainly concerned with fighting over territory to sell drugs and stolen property, ...or conflicts over ""logos"". Basically a bunch of shaggy, unwashed, adult-adolescents on motor-cycles, they largely seem to be entertained by killing and maiming others like themselves. They largely ignore the general populous. However, these are by far the most dangerous predators out there, even individually. Many of them have prior military affiliation, and some are combat-veterans. There is a reason why all the other gangs are afraid of them. The fact that they prey mostly on other criminals makes them the least contemptible in the menagerie.",1316044800,7,2945,5.259574468085106

3333955,3,B0012XIGXC,"Gangland: Season One is probably a kind of acquired taste, for
those fascinated with power structures, cliques, clans, the
underworld, criminology and generally, what occurs on the streets,
in the biggest, most densely populated and immigrant concentrated
areas of the USA.

Having sampled just a few of the episodes of this season, the
release is impressive, from its brief yet well researched, fact
based narrative.

The episode on the Eme is an example, reminiscent significantly of
Olmos's American Me. With a growth based out of a Juvenile Hall
reformatory, expanding to Fulsom Penn, then to other ones, such as
Pelican Bay, and others in California, the eme dozens of thousands
of members.

The episode suggests that 90% of the leadership is located behind
bars,  carrying out life terms without parole, managing to control
from afar all street member behavior, operations, and reprimands
keeping members and rivals in line.

What most people don't know, or realize or want to hear, is the
outcome of an individual being pigeon-holed in underground
activity, and adopting a criminal mind and career, is perhaps a
loss of all hope in joining what most would consider a normal life,
as shown by the  mainstream population with a legit occupation. T

This is extraordinarily serious, for the simple reason that once a
member joins, only death can take that person away, never divorce,
separation, lack of interest, boredom, frustration, annoyance with
the group, etc.

Extortion is commonplace and profitable, not only in neighborhoods,
the streets being organized into territories, but also cell blocks
in jails, each having a designated ""bloquero"" or gang member whose
role is to collect money from protection rackets. This is not a
small role, as over 50,000 gang members hierarchically in one form
or another, respond to the eMe.

Symbolism, artwork, Aztec culture is a leveraged for identity and
pride purposes through tattoos and dialects. Unlike some monarchies
of the past, there is no room  for comedy, self criticism or a
joker telling inconvenient truths.

A controversial statement is made, such as having a target play
basketball to get his blood moving and later bleed and die faster
upon a shank wound etc.

Surveillance video footage, the witness protection program, members
rolling over, confidential informants,  lock down are some tools
used to fight against the underground made up of members, known as
carnales by the system.

At the same time, valuable lessons are learned in day to day
conduct, for anyone in any small business or major corporation,
which is the requirement for a total allegiance, respect to
leadership and clan image, as well as an omerta about the
day-to-day goings on in the clique. Information is power, worth
money, secrecy often the key to success in face of the system,
anarchists, delinquents and rivals.

Another lesson, is the careful hiring policy into the gang, by
virtue of the member needing to add to the gang from a reputation,
image, prestige and an ability to exert fear and intimidation on
others, for profits, and diminish the dependency on the ""muscle"".
Skimming profits off sales, or pocketing cash that is unearned,
carries a death sentence by those involved.",1266451200,,3226,5.129770992366412
3333956,3,B0012XIGXC,Season Two is much better.  It took awhile for shipping even though it was expedited.,1265760000,,85,4.666666666666667
3333957,5,B0012XIGXC,"I have watched every episode of this series (thank you DVR!) since its inception.  I find it to be one of the more compelling documentaries on television today.  I have purchased all seasons thus far released on DVD and will continue to do so until the series ends.

Each episode is well-researched and presents points-of-view from within the gang, as well as law-enforcement.  If you didn't think gangs were much of a problem, this series may change your mind ... gangs are EVERYWHERE.

Although I am sure that there are some who would view this program as a glorification of gang-life, I strongly disagree.  The brutal and tragic truth behind all the gangs presented clearly illustrate a warning of the insidious nature of gang-life.

Although the MTV-like presentation of the subject matter can be abrasive (especially the repetitious ""arrrrgggghh"" that infests each and every episode), the format could be meant to induce younger viewers to watch the show.  What makes this series so interesting is that it focuses on all gangs, not just those that have been highlighted by the media over the years (Bloods, Crips, Hells Angels, etc.) ... prison gangs, outlaw motorcycle gangs, inner-city gangs, white-supremacy gangs ... this series covers them all in manner that is hard to ignore.",1260403200,2,1287,5.037735849056604

Most of the episodes are a pure joke, these so called gangs are nothing more than a bunch of teen high school drop outs waving gang signs and driving around in $200 dollar cars but the producers somehow thought they should dedicate a full episode to those losers.

Most of the characters are a joke, I couldn't stop from laughing when I was watching some of these clowns lecturing there ideals infront of the camera, truly the highest moment in there lives.

I'd say maybe 2 or 3 episodes are watchable , the American gangster and the Arian brotherhood thats about it, the rest are just pure garbage, I recommend MSNBC Lock Up.",1259884800,4,807,4.402684563758389

When I watched the first season DVDs over a weekend I really began to notice the repeated use of some stock footage and audio.  I realize that in a ""documentary"" style often they have to stretch still photos into moving images and use sound effects to liven things up but I think some are overused.  I don't remember it being bothersome when episodes are watched individually over a longer period of time however so depending on your viewing habits you might not be bothered.

Many of the gangs are simply copy-cats of each other and therefore some of the episodes became rather blahh as a result.  I would have rather had an episode or two on generic gang topics like how they acquire weapons and drugs to perhaps tags and symbology interpreted for a change of pace.  As it is this series is sort of like a Who's-Who index of gangs rather than a look at the broader picture and what traits many of these groups share and why.",1242000000,8,1176,4.492957746478873

3333966,2,B0012XIGXC,"Whatever informative or educational value this program could have had is utterly demolished by the disgusting over-use of one sound effect; a generic one used billions of times before in video games, TV, and movies, of a male voice going ""AAAARGH!"" which is played as much as possible, as often as possible, over and over and over and over and over and over again.

For reference, the sound effect sounds a lot like Charlie Brown going ""AAAGH!"" with his head straight up so his mouth opens up massively.

In between scene shifts, from showing pictures to showing interviews to showing footage to showing ANYTHING, this aggravating sound effect is played, to a point where the series becomes simply unwatchable.  It is unwatchable.  And all because of one stupid sound effect played several dozen times per episode.",1224979200,2,814,4.963235294117647

The things that I saw in that special I can't print here! As terrifying as it was to me, I couldn't stop watching. I've seen other episodes of this series and it reveals things about gangs that I never knew. If all you think of street gangs is a bunch of hoodlums with no intelligence and are just troublemakers, then I would DOUBLY recommend this series! While this series won't change the world, it'll make you have a better prespective of what these gangs are about. I've seen horror movies that weren't as scary as the things shown here.

I will say up front it does contain language and some disturbing scenes so if you are the Bible thumping type or if you get offended easily, then don't watch this series. Kind of sad in a way though since some of the information revealed here could actually save a life!
