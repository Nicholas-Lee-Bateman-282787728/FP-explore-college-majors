8465986,2,B00004Z1G4,Love this film and hadn't seen it in awhile. Was really looking forward to it. The video quality is really poor on this though. It feels like a bad bootleg.,1499385600,,156,4.233333333333333
8465987,4,B00004Z1G4,"This one I bought  to complete my  Helena Bonham Carer Collection. It was not easy to finally  get a copy that at least was equipped with a english Subtitles. ( Long time it would only have been available in french, a language I only have a fragmentic knowledge  and would be unable to enjoy the film).
But finally I managed to get this copy , which unfourtunately leaks a bit in clear sound. As mentioned before the english Subtitles help to overcome this difficulty. This is the only reason why  I am deducting 1 Star of the entire rating. I have not been disappointed of the story. Even though french ain t my language , and the country i only visited a vew times i still think the shots of Paris and other locations are well done , and describing the society and caracters very well.",1389484800,,787,4.363013698630137
8465988,5,B00004Z1G4,"This is a wonderful, subtly deep romantic comedy about a group of film makers and fashion designers in Paris. With interesting, fully  developed characters, no violence and real sex, it is the kind of thing Hollywood would remake poorly (e.g., compare Abre Los Ojos with Vanilla Sky) if they could--but they can't. Abortion, infidelity, ""feminism"" vs. ""misogyny,"" the craving for recognition and fame--and their difference from the search for true art and love are all handled with a most delicate touch.",1073174400,25,504,5.222222222222222
