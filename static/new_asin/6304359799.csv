It needed a ""Star Wars"" script at the start and would have been a better film.",1173312000,,248,4.25531914893617

I'm 67 and first saw this in the mid-1980's on cable...  still love it.  It was a favorite of my son and his friends in 3rd grade.",1429401600,,304,4.660377358490566

7868790,4,6304359799,"I first saw this in the late 1970's and have searched for it ever since.  My kids and I really loved it.  After finally tracking it down, I must admit much of it is dated, but the message still comes through.  Live your dreams.  You'll be surprised what you find..and what you learn.",1384214400,,283,4.283018867924528

in a perfect for her amazing talents.

The balloon adventure will carry you away, as it di me, I believe! The Musical score is wonderfuland captures and underscores everything in a charming manner.",1376438400,,304,5.08
7868792,4,6304359799,"This was an okay/goofy/fanasty movie, but it was not very well made.  I only bought it to add to my Katharine Hepburn collection.  It made me sad to watch one of my favorite actresses stoop to the level of this movie.  Kids might get a kick out of it, but Hepburn fans will probably experience the sadness I felt.",1337385600,2,313,4.271186440677966
7868793,5,6304359799,"I saw this movie on TV years ago and video taped it, but loaned the tape to someone and lost it.  I was soooo  happy to find it again.  It shows childhood in a more pleasant time, plus wonderful acting and terrific scenery and a fantastic ending!!!  It is a perfect movie for all generations!!!

I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  Thank you!!

7868794,5,6304359799,"This is essentially a children's movie, but it will delight anyone at any age. The only adult on screen is Katharine Hepburn in a fantastic performance at the end of a stellar career. The story is an engaging one in which a 8-year-old boy and his friend attempt to fly a hot air balloon that had belonged to his granfather, in honour of his birthday. I highly recommend this little-known film for all viewers.",1274486400,3,409,4.54054054054054
