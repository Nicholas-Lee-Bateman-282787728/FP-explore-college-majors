But after doing the practice session  I decided the choreography was okay. I would put this dvd at high intermedite and advanced. Unless your a beginner of beginner intermediate who would just like the challenge.

 The dvd total running time is 60minutes and I think they used the time wisely except for the repitions of the same performance. The outift was the same as well. The background etc. The only thing that changed was the veil. I am okay with having no instruction but I would have liked it if, Nourhan, had went over the music, maybe identified some of the rhythms and explained why she came up with the choreography the way she did. What it meant to her or rather Yousry. Just a tiny glimpse into their artistry. That could have took the place of the choreorgaphy being shown twice.

 There are 8 parts to the choreography. Part of the choreography is demonstrated, then done at half-speed. There is no breakdown of any movements.  When I say there is no breakdown. I mean there is no breakdown. The choreography is not especially difficult but there are a lot of turns and transitions that could throw someone off. The practice clothing she wears makes her movements visible though and the camera shooting was decent. She is in a room with a huge pillow(seat cushion) on the floor, where she puts the tambourine before she dances with it.

  In the choreography the beginning starts with a veil, but in part one of the combination instruction. She does not have a veil. Personally I thought the combination without the veil looked better. Part five she throws in the tambourine and around part 6 she has on a khaleegy outfit. Part 8 is the finale.

 I liked this dvd because there was no breakdown. I wanted to practice getting movements without everything being counted out. So for that reason and the fact that I bought it for $6.00 I give this dvd 3stars. I am not a huge fan of the choreography but neither did I dislike it. I can see myself modifying many moves and making it my own. With that said had I bought this dvd, at the almost $30.00 asking price or $40.00 for the dvd. It would have in no way been worth it.
The tape ends with another performance . It's the same performance so I am unsure as to why it was thrown in. This is a lengthy piece of music. Then there is a Special thanks, Coming Soon, and a little bit about the Sharif dance academy.

7964654,3,B000068RNI,"First, let me say that Hazar Fazar is a very long piece of music (about 11 minutes). This video shows Nourhan Sharif performing the dance in segments - both in full and half time - but it is more like trying to follow the moves of your favorite belly dancer in a performance video instead of actually learning from an instructional video. Moreover, some of the choreography is rushed and, sorry to say, a little goofy (can you imaging shooting ""finger"" guns while you shimmy?) If you really want to learn combinations and be able to use them in your own dances, Jillina's videos are amazing. If you can learn by just watching a wonderful dancer and you want to learn Egyptian style belly dancing, then I highly suggest that you purchase videos featuring shimmy queen Leyla Jouvana or any of the IAMED videos (academy of middle eastern dance).",1109635200,11,842,4.657718120805369
7964655,5,B000068RNI,"* IF you're an intermediate to advanced level dancer with a pretty thorough understanding of basic movements & traveling steps
* IF you're a visual learner who can pick up the moves by watching them in slow motion and full speed
* IF you're interested in a very ""authentic"" choreography (Yousry Sharif is Egyptian, after all!) as in ""here's this rhythm, we need to switch to this step""
* IF you're more interested at this point in the hows and whys of choreography than a breakdown of the steps.
IF all of the above are true for you, you'll get a lot out of this video. Nourhan never once really breaks down a single step of this choreography, as in ""do this with your feet, do this with your hip, do this with your arms."" Instead, the choreo is broken into sections, with each section shown at full speed and again at half speed. Nourhan's voice-over says things llike ""Now greet the audience"" and ""we're not using every DUM here, just pick and choose"" and ""here's the Khaleegy rhythm, so we're going to do Khaleegy steps"" (or something like that).  The dance is quite long, and uses veil and tambourine. The music is available on Wash Ya Wash Volume 2.
If you've been dancing a while and you couldn't possibly sit through yet another explanation of a hip lift, drop or shoulder shimmy, this is a great video for you!!  If you like a thorough breakdown of the steps used in a dance or get frustrated easily, you'll hate it.",1086307200,20,1424,4.473076923076923
