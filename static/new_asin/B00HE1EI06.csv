6155906,4,B00HE1EI06,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS

In a nutshell, Stephen Poliakoff's ""Dancing on the Edge"" is a slow but ultimately rewarding period drama; a well-acted and beautifully shot miniseries which explores a number of themes based in the social issues of the 1930s.

Encompassing five episodes in all, each one begins with pianist Louis Lester (Chiwetel Ejiofor) hiding out in the offices of the Music Express magazine, discussing his desperate need to flee the country with journalist Stanley Mitchell (Matthew Goode). As Stanley tries to make arrangements, Louis's memories take us back in time to observe the events that led to him going on the run.

In London 1933, Louis is established as a piano player desperately trying to keep his jazz band from being deported back to the States by lining up a number of short-term gigs in basement clubs - often hindered as much as helped by their cranky band manager. Stanley is an ambitious young journalist always on the lookout for the next big thing when he discovers the band and manages to secure a residency for them at the Imperial Hotel. Needless to say, the white guests run the gamut from astonished to appalled at the sight of a black jazz band entertaining them at dinner.

However, after adding a couple of singers (Wunmi Mosaku and Angel Coulby) to the line-up, things begin to improve for the band - particularly when the Prince of Wales signals his approval. From this point, we're left with a massive cast of characters to contend with, all of whom have secret desires and agendas of their own. There are the aristocratic and highly-strung siblings Pamela and Julian Lascombe (Tom Hughes and Joanna Vanderham), forward-thinking and free-spirited photographer Sarah Peters (Janet Montgomery) and the enigmatic Donaldson (Anthony Head), a ""collector"" who only goes by his last name. Then there's Julian's employer, American millionaire Walter Masterson (John Goodman, playing against his usual comedic type), and the reclusive Lady Lavinia Cremone (Jacqueline Basset), who takes a shine to the band's young singers.

It's an eclectic group of people who have virtually nothing in common besides an appreciation for jazz music and an acknowledgement that the Louie Lester band might turn out to be a valuable commodity, and much of the drama is wrung from how these individuals interact with each other. Louis strikes up a romance with Sarah, as does Stanley with Pamela, whilst Julian forms an obsessive attachment to singer Jessie.

Though the band has to contend with constant reminders of their precarious situation and an undercurrent of sinister goings-on, no one is prepared for what happens next. After playing for the Prince of Wales, Louis returns to the hotel to find Jessie bleeding heavily from a stab wound. Mysterious circumstances surround the attack and suspicion naturally falls on Louis despite the lack of evidence. As the net closes around him, he discovers who among his white friends can really be trusted.

As said ""Dancing on the Edge"" is beautifully put together, though the pacing is extremely slow - one might even say sluggish. But if you can get past the lengthy set-up, Poliakoff is excellent in creating an atmosphere of unease and secrecy, where overheard conversations and ambiguous scenes go unexplained, forcing the audience to pay close attention to all that unfolds. (It felt nice to be treated as an intelligent viewer for a change, in which the show trusts me to put the pieces together instead of spelling it all out). By the time Louis realizes that he's been slowly but surely set-up to take the blame for Jessie's murder, the tension is palatable.

Among the extensive cast are several stand-outs: Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew Goode are as solid as ever, but Tom Hughes and Joanna Vanderham as siblings Julian and Pamela are among the most memorable characters. Both are cold and a bit detached, yet earnest and eager to please. Their languorous eyes bring to mind a perpetual drug stupor and both speak in low, measured voices that suggest fragility and barely-controlled desperation. It's impossible to guess what either of them might be thinking at any given moment, so you're left constantly trying to figure them out.

John Goodman is also surprisingly good as the benevolent yet sinister Masterson, whose strange relationship with his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is clearly the key to the whole mystery, though the biggest revelation would have to be Angel Coulby as Jessie. Best known for her role as Guinevere in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00B5A9FLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>, she completely sheds that character's persona in order to embody the sultry little singer whose death kick-starts the murder-mystery angle. Granted, Jessie is hardly a well-developed character, but Angel belts out jazz numbers like she's been doing it all her life.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention Jenna Louise Coleman, now best known as the latest companion on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00C6ACVD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, who here has a small part as Stanley's secretary.

At times the miniseries can be a bit unfocused as to what exactly it purports to be, touching on several themes without really exploring any of them. Is it an in-depth look at the historical period? A study of racism and classism in the 1930's? A celebration of jazz and its ability to break down social barriers? A character study based around mixed-race friendships and romances? Or just a plain old murder mystery? In trying to be all of these (and more) it can't really focus on any of them to any great extent, leaving the entire thing rather unclear as to its purpose.

And though most would describe the story as that of a black jazz band trying to cope with the pressures and prejudices of the 1930s, one glance at the DVD cover will attest that with the exception of Louis Lester, the show is far more interested in its white characters (the band members aren't even given the dignity of having names - they're credited by the instruments they play).

But despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed ""Dancing on the Edge"". There are fancy costumes, great cinematography, a beautiful rendering of 1930s London, some gorgeous old buildings, a catchy original soundtrack (granted, I know virtually nothing about jazz; all I can attest to is that I liked what I heard here), and a wonderful level of suspense in the last two episodes. As of July 2013, it has yet to air on American television or be released on DVD, but keep your eyes open for whichever comes first. I'd say it's worth a look.",1373241600,48,6707,5.170506912442396
6155907,5,B00HE1EI06,"I was able to see the episodes on YouTube, since it is not available yet in America.  This is a fantastic historical period piece.  The acting was superb, as was the music.  It was a wonderful story, with wonderfully rich characters.  Matthew Goode was wonderful as always.  I hate that they put minor characters like Jacqueline BIssette and John Goodman in the forefront, thereby mitigating the importance of the premier characters of the story.

Again, the acting was fantastic and the music was fabulous.  It reminded me of period pieces like the Great Gatsby and of Brideshead Revisited.

I'm hoping that it will be available soon so I can purchase it from Amazon.",1370649600,34,668,4.849557522123894

6155933,4,B00HE1EI06,"Go period piece,go mystery, go relationships and from what I can tell, pretty accurate to the age. A bit of 'political correctness' (again, from what I can tell), but not much. Which is really surprising. A few US period pieces and Aussie, like Miss FIsher's mysteries and Murdock Mysteries (in the states it's the Artful Detective) are both SOO ridiculously 21st Century. Now Netflix has Murdock Mysteries  (the Artful Detective) under the ""Historical series"" category - and so that's the plan!  - watch and think that sex outside of marriage, birth control, abortion, homosexual relationships are Victorian/Edwardian ideals and routine living!!!",1471132800,,647,5.396039603960396

6155936,5,B00HE1EI06,"THE MUSIC IS FANTASTIC. The sets, costumes, and acting are, as they may have said in 1933, the bees knees. I like period film, saw a preview, and expected a good show; I saw greatness. With seven hours of captivating story, this is a bargain now that it is well past release day and the price is greatly reduced.
Abundant seasoned actors tell a story that seems believable. You feel a kinship with almost all characters, and picking who-dun-it early is unlikely for even the sharpest of sofa sleuths.

Among The Band you see Chiwetel Ejiofor, Wunmi Mosaku, and perky Angel Coulby (Merlin). On the magazine scene is Matthew Goode (Birdsong, Downton), Jenna Coleman (Death Comes to Pemberly; Titanic), Mel Smith, Allan Corduner, and American John Goodman. Jazz lovers that get involved: Joanna Vanderham (The Paradise), Janet Montgomery, Anthony Head, Tom Hughes and of course Jacqueline Bisset (see Old Fashioned Thanksgiving).

===1===  London,1933 Louis Lester seeks Stanleys help to exit England. Then the back story of 18 months reveals the rise of the band at the Imperial Hotel.
===2===  London 1933-then quickly back to 1932 for more of the Jazz bands history. BBC Radio. Record deal. Command performance. Disaster.
===3===  London 1933 jumps back to 7 weeks earlier, Christmas week 1932. Nazi racism is introduced. New Years via the wireless, fireworks, death.
===4===  London 1933 fast moves to 8 days previous. A Music Express 32-page special photo edition initiating the rag being bought by a rich American. The fix & escape has started.
===5=== The band splits, leader running, who do you trust? A final game of hide and seek and revelations.
===6=Interviewing Louis=== The only episode with a title that begins in London 1932, a long term series of interviews with flashbacks and new insight into previous scenes with social philosophy of the time.
The end provided a step into a new season, so there is hope for more fine 30s Jazz.",1456963200,12,1944,5.003095975232198

6155954,3,B00HE1EI06,"The series started with a bang, drew me in quickly.  I loved the concept...a Black jazz band struggling to make it in London in the years between the wars.  There was an interesting and varied group of characters, mostly all very good to look at, lots of fun music, and wonderful sets and costumes.  Altogether a good show.  Somewhere down the line, though, it seems like the writer couldn't quite pull together the plot lines he had set up and Episode Five, is sort of lame and Episode Six is quite a mistake.  I rate it three and a half.",1439683200,2,539,4.35

6155983,3,B00HE1EI06,"Dancing on the edge on blu-ray is very interesting at times and boring and predictable at other times. The sets and costumes of London and the Imperial hotel are beautiful. Matthew Goode is entirely capable of carrying the 5/6 episodes and keeping you interested and all the characters are believable in their parts. Having been born in the 40's, I can say that the music does not always come up to the standards of 30's jazz and never approaches Duke Ellington who was one of the greats and is supposedly an inspiration for the band leader. I was looking forward to hearing real jazz. Nor do the girl singers approach the heights that every character seems to think they do  Everyone now goes for actors that can sing in the shower and refuses to dub voices. So you are left with mediocre music and high school play singers. The music is also repetitive, so that you keep hearing the same songs over and over. The writer in the featurette says he is happy to have 6 episodes to tell the story, but the story is only 5 episodes long and episode 6 is Stanley interviewing Louis. Parts of this interview are interesting and the end is bizarre in a Twilight Zone type of way. The writer in his stumbling speaking style says he wants this movie to haunt us but I think it should haunt him.",1433116800,8,1285,4.444915254237288
6155984,5,B00HE1EI06,"No idea what to expect, but became totally hooked for these reasons:
1. Intelligent dialogue and storyline, including language and behaviors that in many contexts would be explosive and controversial, but in this film was highly appropriately educational. A very well researched period piece dealing with both early 20th century British culture (a little American too); influence of music in culture (in this case mostly jazz); aristocracy relations with the poor (things never change); black (and other groups) relations with white power (money, politics, etc.).
2. Superb acting.
3. Superb period singing and accompanying music.
4. Most importantly for a quality film is attention to detail.
5. Suspenseful drama (Whodunit?).
6. Left room for a continuation which, unfortunately, doesn't appear to be in the works.
7. Interesting final episode of tidying up loose ends, even interviewing the dead as if they never died.",1431388800,2,921,5.4475524475524475
6155985,5,B00HE1EI06,"I loved Dancing on the Edge from episode one, which set up a cast of intriguing characters, great music, and a subtle, biting look at race relations in 1930s England.

The rise and fall of the Louis Lester Band is brilliantly pegged against the backdrop of the fascist mindsets of the decade leading up to WWII. On one hand, the upper crust Britons who take up Louis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) treat him with a casual equality, but on the other hand, he's still Not One of Them. The cavalier way in which the band's manager--the ""uppity"" Wesley--is treated is chilling and lays the seeds for the quandary in which Louis is later placed.

The linchpin between the jazz band and the upper crust is cockney jazz journalist Stanley Mitchell (Matthew Goode), whose loyalties seem swayed by his hot romance with socialite Pamela and his own adoption by these wealthy Bright Young Things of British society.

Rounding out the cast are Jessie and Carla, the two canaries of the band, and Sarah, a Russian Jewess photographer who falls for Louis. Through these three characters we also see the various prisms of race and gender, and the tensions inherent.

While some may feel the suspense subplot takes Dancing on the Edge down a bizarre path, I thoroughly disagree--it is necessary to lay bare the bitter irony of Louis's (and Jessie, Sarah, etc) interactions with the upper crust. I did, however, find the coda bizarre and misplaced in its attempt to act as a harbinger of WWII--but it provided more background for some of the characters.

But really, I love this drama for the Stanley/Louis bromance. Chiwetel and Matthew play so well off one another they feel like dear friends in real life. I need to see them paired in something else!",1426032000,19,1724,4.771812080536913
6155986,2,B00HE1EI06,"Whatever points this series was trying to make are lost in the dreadful script, terrible faux jazz music and bad acting.  The ""mystery"" is obvious, the history is inaccurate and the social polemics are boring. The worst thing about the series is the music and the mediocre singers. Being a period piece with British actors doesn't make something a worthwhile drama. Don't waste your time or your money on this drivel.",1397260800,7,417,4.873239436619718
