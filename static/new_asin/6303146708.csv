7840303,4,6303146708,"As I watched this I kept seeing Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" in my mind.  Linda Purl plays a hardworking single mother who has a very hard driving boss who sometimes takes credit for her work.  Linda Gray plays the pampered wife of a very wealthy but cheating husband.  They meet because of an automobile accident ( hence the title of the film ) and in sharing their woes a plot is hatched for each of them doing away with the other's problem.  But can these two attractive women actually summon the courage to kill?",1092528000,4,522,4.463157894736842
