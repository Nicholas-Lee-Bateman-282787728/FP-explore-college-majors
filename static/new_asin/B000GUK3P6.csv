Many of the documentaries are shocking - almost no wonder they are not available on NTSC.  Of course these were for British TV and they contain a slant that needs to be considered when viewing them.  But most of the information I have confirmed from other sources.  On what would seem to be a lighter side, until you consider the ramifications, the Coke/Pepsie Wars is an enjoyable segment.  The segment on the arms trade is revealing and the Chagos Island, Australian Aborigines, and East Timor segments are absolutely shocking.  I doubt most Americans either remember or are aware of these situations.  They should be!",1440288000,,748,4.796875
8134823,4,B000GUK3P6,"John Pilger's documentaries are informative, well-made and often extremely controversial. In my view of all his box-sets yet released ""Documentaries that changed the world"" is by far the best.

One of the most controversial documentaries in the set is ""Palestine is still the issue"" about Israeli oppression of the Palestinians. It received a great deal of criticism from pro-Israel groups but also a number of awards. Another important film is ""Paying the price, Killing the Children of Iraq"". Though this is no longer contemporary (as it was when I first watched it) anybody who believes that the Iraqi people have been the focus of our compassionate concern since Gulf War 1 should watch this film.

The set also contains a classic documentary from 1970 called ""Vietnam the quiet mutiny"" which caused a great stir when originally released. It is about the demoralisation of U.S troops in Vietnam and the open mutiny that was beginning to develop amongst them at this time.

""Flying the flag, Arming the world"" deals with a subject that is seldom brought up by Journalists in Britain. That of the arms trade. It reveals British involvement in selling arms to oppressive regimes like Saudi Arabia.

One aspect of the films in this collection that I liked (and in Pilger's films in general) are the scenes in which he grills government ministers (or whoever else is responsible for wrong-doing in the context of the film). It is satisfying to watch journalists hold the powerful to account for crimes we rarely hear discussed i.e the (now former) sanctions regime in Iraq.

Ignore the cheesy cover and watch the documentaries in this box-set. They will challenge your view of the world and mainstream journalism in general. Highly recommended!",1392508800,2,1743,5.038194444444445
8134824,4,B000GUK3P6,"Vietnam -The Quiet Mutiny (1970
Of tragic days of the Vietnam War, this doco embedded American young men-soldiers' daily routine risking lives unstoppably, missing a very point of religious inspiration undertaking the actions undertaken.

  Year Zero-The Silent Death of Cambodia
This doco is a sound monument to lasting international incapability to stop genocide in a modern world more recently in Rwanda and the Balkans as Maoists in Cambodia had exterminated millions of people.
Probably, info on filming arrangements in then Poll Pot Kampuchea could sustain not less interesting doco by an investigating journalist rather naively suggesting that international humanitarian help might be arranged in political vacuum locally.

  Death Of A Nation -The Timor Conspiracy
Interesting educative doco provides interesting information on British involvement in Indonesian annexing of East Timor with slight hints on gas reserves local.
No mentioning on religious issues and post-9/11 environment has been provided even with later J. Pilger's commenting.

  Palestine Is Still The Issue
Produced in 2002, this documentary substantially convinces a reviewer in a Jewish guilt for a strong willingness to maintain the Jewish State Israel is.

However, such an impression is unworkable in this reviewer's particular case because of knowledge that Palestine was never ever an Arabic political entity and British could not promise what did not belong to them if even an area was ruled by then Great Britain under an international mandate.

In general, if not a pressure of journalist's private opinions, chronicles conclude interesting educative data and testify to personal networking capabilities and talents of Sydneysider preferring the living and working in his historical fatherland.",1270512000,2,1781,5.708333333333333
