8535213,4,B0006A9IKW,"Starry-eyed, small town bankteller Suzanne Fountain (played by Bonnie Dickenson) sells her powder blue compact and  moves to New York City,  plummeting headlong  into a twisted mid-NYC-summer nights' wonderland  of hipster wannabe's,  midnight rhinestone cowboys, ex-cheerleader shucksters, bisexual gigolos and dangerous, carrot be-wigged  club kids!

After a frantic apartment search which includes foot massages, Roswellian abduction art, free cocaine, vegetables and some very  large urban  koi, she settles into her new ""life"" in a Lower East Side art-cave with Titania (Tight for short- self-styled ""Queen of the Faeries"" played by Philly.)

In the hallway of this half-star establishment lives  a kinda-homeless speedfreak rave-lette, Kathy, (Leanne Whitney,) a girl Suzanne soon comes to realize is very much like herself. Together they plunder the Port Authority, become fashion accessories to a pseudo-murder, dance away the mean reds and almost get discovered.

Paced at a crystal meth r.p.m., populated with familiar underground faces, Eric Sapp of Frisk, Little Shots of Happiness, Keith Levy a.k.a Sherry Vine of Scream Teen Scream!, Stonewall, Craig Chester of Swoon, Kiss Me Guido fame, Shucking the Curve is crazy-glued together by wild (and sometimes raw) improvisation,  a soundtrack of ambient glitter, electronica riffs, Japanese pop and primal pretense art-noize and another fab award-winning Bonnie D. performance which begs and pleads the question:
