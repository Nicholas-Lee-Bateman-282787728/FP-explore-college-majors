But this phantom galleon carries the coffins of the satanic Templar, eyeless zombies who hunt humans by sound.

THE GHOST GALLEON aka ""Horror of the Zombies"" (Spain-1974) is a strange, cheezy frighter about a fog-enshrouded 16th Century Spanish galleon carrying treasure and hooded monsters, supposedly spirits of Knights Templar, that lurk in a shadowy hold until a small boat comes alongside and the people on it climb aboard.

Three scantily clad Euro models are the first to get devoured by the zombies. The last of them dies gruesomely: head nearly off, with zombies chowing on individual body parts.

Bleach blonde B&aacute;rbara Rey plays this unfortunate. Her acting throughout is pretty dismal and the woman who dubbed her in English is worse. She doesn't even try to match mouth movements when Rey is repeatedly screaming ""No!"" in a scene with glacier-speed creatures that catch and drag her below. This sequence goes on so long you could leave the couch, make a sandwich and when you return, B&aacute;rbara's on the floor still clawing at deck planks, a zombie firmly attached to her left ankle.

Jack Taylor, the token American in a main cast of seven, fell into Mexican 'B' grade frighters in mid career, and like B&aacute;rbara in the hold, he never did escape them. A relocation to Europe brought him roles in such cult classics as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUCCUBUS/dp/6305183376/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUCCUBUS</a>&nbsp;(W Germany-1968) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VOODOO-PASSION/dp/B000E3185E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VOODOO PASSION</a>** (Switzerland-1977).

Instead, the zombie ship and accompanying fog arrive first. Both girls end up on this cobwebbed craft, out of radio contact with Jack. He, three employees (including a ""professor"") and a lez lover (the strident Rey) of one of the girls go searching for the missing women.

My main beef with all ""undead"" pictures is the monsters move in slow motion yet they almost always manage to get their prey. No exception here. Rey is latched on to and she caterwauls for what seems an eternity before the sword strikes. But it's conundrums like this that keep us viewers thinking. Ah, there's nothing like an intellectually-stimulating monster film.

2614109,5,B000GIXCLU,"Bell bottoms, bikinis, and the living dead. Just gotta love it. It's not always about a trendy teeny plot; it's about atmosphere and mood. This kind of movie ignites my fond memories and gives plenty of room for imagination. I'm not a film critic, so excuse the lack of ""critic"" vernacular. Give it a shot with an open mind. Sometimes less is better, or at least in moderation.",1365897600,,377,4.5588235294117645
2614110,5,B000GIXCLU,"This is the slowest moving and least violent of the blind dead films, but it's the most atmospheric. The films slow pace and lack of gore may disappoint many, but this is a very well done classic with great atmosphere; it's a great creepy late night film. However, some consider this movie the worst in the series because of its pacing and shortage of exploitation. If you don't want something that's really gory but want something that's going to concentrate heavily on atmosphere, you might like it. It's well directed, and they did a great job with something that's obviously low budget; they had to use some toy models for some shots. There's no nudity, and the gore is very limited. There's only one on-screen death with the Templar zombies; this is the films only gore scene. Aside from that scene, all the other deaths with the zombies are off-screen. There's also a brief scene near the end when a woman stabs a guy, but you actually only see a bit of blood in the water when he's just floating there dead. I was kind of disappointed that it didn't have more gore, but it's still a great atmospheric film. A large portion of the film takes place on the misty haunted galleon at sea, so there's a lot of time spent with people roaming the creepy boat. A lot of emphasis is spent on filming the galleon, along with the dark misty atmosphere that surrounds it. The atmosphere with all that mist that's combined with the boat and sea is superb. The films plot involves an abandoned galleon that's adrift. The ship doesn't attack anyone, and passengers on other boats who come across it have to board the galleon in order to awaken the Templars that lie asleep in their coffins. The easy to follow story has a couple of women who are lost at sea that take refuge on the galleon and are killed. Then another group goes looking for them, and these people find and board the ghost galleon; I like the way most of the film just takes place on that old and decrepit boat with all that mist. The slow pace along with the lack of violence will bore some people who are expecting a much more action packed flick. However, I thought the slow pace was necessary because the purpose of the film was to create one of those movies that's best watched late at night or on a rainy day. Instead of concentrating on exploitation, the movie is mostly about atmosphere. The screen time of the zombies are limited. I also personally think that this film improves with repeated viewings.

The DVD quality looks great. It has excellent color, sharpness, and contrast. The brightness is also really good, but a lot of the film is dark which is the way it's supposed to look. The excellent picture quality is important because it allows you to see all of the films great atmosphere and scenery with that creepy boat.  The extras are good as well. It's best to watch the film in Spanish with the English subtitles.",1363651200,4,2892,4.527724665391969

2614112,4,B000GIXCLU,While the ship model was trash the rest of the movie was good. What do you expect for a man directing this with hardly any budget,1239148800,3,129,4.0
2614113,2,B000GIXCLU,"This is the third in the Spanish ""Blind Dead"" series from Amando de Ossorio. This film has been released under a huge number of names, including ""Horror of the Zombies"", ""The Blind Dead 3"", ""Ghost Ships of the Blind Dead"", ""Zombie Flesh Eater"", and ""El Buque Maldito"".

The acting is fairly wooden (the dubbing doesn't help, of course), the premise is completely ludicrous, but the worst feature of the film is the pacing. Basically it comes down to this: an evil rich guy puts two swimsuit models in a boat for them to fake being stranded as a publicity stunt. I don't know how great this stunt could have possibly been in the mind of the filmmakers, but they treat it like it's as important as nuclear launch codes. The girls (of course) get lost in a mysterious fog, where a ghost ship intercepts them. The logical thing for them to do is to explore it, whereupon they promptly discover that it is full of lugubrious zombies which move so slowly that the girls could easily outrun them, but don't.

The rest of the protagonists including the egomaniacal idiot who came up with the harebrained scheme (Howard Tucker), a peculiar doctor of some sort (Professor Grber), and a model who is actually also a hostage show up at the ghost ship to rescue the girls. Professor Grber immediately reveals ""I'm certain that we're immersed in another dimension, completely uncommon to us all."" The backstory is then revealed to have something to do with the ""Templars"" being banished by the Pope in the sixteenth century, so they now dwell on this ship with their treasure where they are subject to black magic rituals.

The cast gets thinned out one by one amongst lots of tramping around the creaky old ship. They decide to throw the zombies into the sea and then swim to a nearby island, although Professor Grber, a nonswimmer, gets to remain on the ship which has now spontaneously combusted due to the red glowing eyes of a skull with horns.

I gave the film a second star for the conclusion on the island, which, while predictable, was still quite well done and creepy. I won't reveal the resolution in case you haven't guessed how it ends, but it was definitely the highlight of the movie.

I was disappointed in ""The Ghost Galleon"" because of both conception and execution. The film could have been a much more workable and plausible feature if Amando de Ossorio has given the characters more legitimate reasons for interacting the way they did and more reasonable premises for being in the situations they found themselves in. The pacing killed the suspense and reduced the film to the dustbin of zombie movie history. If you are a zombie fanatic, you may want to take a look at this one, otherwise, there are many more, and better, choices available to you.",1226016000,3,2756,4.674226804123712
2614114,2,B000GIXCLU,"So you're a swimsuit model stranded out in the ocean on a publicity stunt, when a fog rolls in... and with it a large ancient looking pirate ship.  What do you do? Climb aboard of course, with no weapons and only your swimsuit and purse to protect you.

I could go into the plot here, but their really isn't much of one.  Two models on a publicity stunt at sea end up Zombie fodder and then a rescue group of completely irritating, non-sensical people follow to find them.  They of course come across the Zombie ship as well.  Then we get to hear about 10 minutes straight of a scientist explaining alternate dimentions and the Templar Knights.

Of course this is low budget, and of course the acting and scripting are so bad you want to shriek.  But where what could have been and excellent B-movie fails, is in it's speed.  If your actors are this bad, then get to the monsters quickly.  If you don't have a plot then spend more time showing monsters... this movie is excruciatingly slow.  And then the Zombies... of course we expect them to look like rubber (it IS a B-Movie after all), but a galapagos tortise could have outrun them.  Certainly they are blind and follow their pray by sound... but the death scenes run WAY too long as the victims stumble around the ship and the Zombies shuffle after them... well not shuffle, that implies some sort of speed... these more just sort of stand there and wait until the stupid people run back into them again.  We of course have the obligitory ""Oh my shoe is stuck"" which does in one of the little ladies... but wow... the death scenes are terrible.  And the gore is so minimal that even the gorehounds won't enjoy this one.

The sad thing is that I really wanted to like this movie, but the poor pacing kept what should have been a wonderful B-Movie from being anything but a letdown.  If you are looking for a movie to sleep through, then this is your ticket.",1211155200,3,1912,4.422857142857143
2614115,2,B000GIXCLU,"`The Ghost Galleon' released in '74 is writer/director Amando de Ossorio's third installment in the ""Blind Dead"" series. In my estimation this film holds the dubious distinction of being the worst of the four films. The action is excruciatingly slow, the women not as attractive and the storyline adds nothing to what has been done in the two previous films. Also bothersome was the idea of placing the slow-moving corpses about a ship, it just didn't work for me.

Of course the genius about making sequels is the fact that you already have established an audience that will by the film whether they like it or not. Who wants something missing from the collection?",1199059200,7,665,4.833333333333333
2614116,2,B000GIXCLU,"By 1974 Amando de Ossario's Blind Dead films seemed to be in a rut. The release of The Ghost Galleon (Horror of the Zombies in America) did nothing to help the series'eventual demise. What started out as a fairly interesting concept had collapsed under its own weight.

The Blind Dead Knight's Templar are back but now they exist in another dimension upon a forever floating ghost ship. The plotting is fairly non-existent. Two models are set adrift on a boat in the major shipping channel by sports equipment tycoon Howard Tucker (Jack Taylor) as a publicity stunt to draw attention to his new water craft. The two girls drift into a mysterious fog and see an ancient floating galleon. This galleon promptly crashes into them. One of the models (Margarita Merino, in an uncredited role) boards the ship rather than stay in her own boat. That night screams are heard and she is never seen again. Her model partner Kathy (Blanca Estrada) follows her friend onto the galleon finding that the Blind Dead are on board who rapidly turn her into zombie dinner.

Thrown into the mix are a would be rescue squad led by Tucker. The group also includes Nomei (Barbara Rey) with whom Kathy may have been having a lesbian affair, Kathy and Nomei's employer Lillian (Maria Perschy), a seemingly lost Professor, and Sergei, Tucker's henchman bodyguard. What follows is fairly predictable with the zombies killing off each one of the rescuers as the film progresses.

The Blue Underground disc features both Spanish and English audio. On this film I opted for the English. The picture quality is very good considering the source material. The viewer should be aware that much of the film is dark and very foggy so clarity is a major issue.

The story as I alluded to is pretty bland. The acting is adequate for a B movie of this type. Performances are generally wooden. The model work is very dated. If you watch carefully at the end of the film you will easily notice problems with the scale of the ship as compared to the ocean it is floating in. On the horror level the film is fairly non gory and except for one or two instances of blood there is no offensive violence. Unlike the first two films the nudity in this outing is nonexistent.

This is worth a viewing for the Ossario completest but is generally not worth seeking out otherwise. The disc also contains the original theatrical trailer, promotional materials for its American release as Horror of the Zombies, and a stills gallery.",1184457600,8,2480,4.71824480369515

8132835,3,B000GIXCLU,"THE GHOST GALLEON (1974) is the third movie in Amando de Ossorio's BLIND DEAD series. A photographer and one of her models meet up w/ two big shot businessmen. Apparently, it's all for some publicity stunt, which sounds suspiciously like an excuse to get these characters out on the ocean, so they can run into the creepy ship of the title! Well, that's because it is. There are already two other models at sea, and they're suddenly stuck in a mysterious fog. Next, a spooky ship appears! This all happens within the first 9 minutes! Seconds later, one of the sea-faring models uses a grappling hook, and boards the huge vessel. Not surprisingly, this isn't a good idea. After all, this is the USS KNIGHTS TEMPLAR, and they're far from friendly! Back on land, the first model is abducted by the businessmen! Don't worry, this doesn't make any sense to me either. Just go w/ it! The photographer, her boss, and a research scientist decide to search for the models. Horror ensues. This movie seems to have been made on the spur of the moment, w/ no money, just for the hell of it. The nonlinear, scatter-brained dialogue fits perfectly w/ the nonsensical ""plot"". Some of the fun of this film occurs when we see that the ""galleon"" is actually a toy boat in someone's bathtub! This is made even more embarrassingly clear, whenever it's shown after seeing real boats in the real ocean! This is cheddar you cannot buy in any store! By the time the Knights arise, it's long past time for the various models, the ultra-irritating scientist, and the other imbeciles to be destroyed! The death scenes are as macabre / gory as ever, but up against the rest of this rib-tickler, they seem out of place. Now, while this might not be the best... well, okay, it's just preposterous! Still, it is a lot of fun to watch! I shall never shake the image of that toy galleon, bobbling like a cork in a puddle! Weeee!...
