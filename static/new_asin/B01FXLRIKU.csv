7752111,5,B01FXLRIKU,"I'm rating this 5/5 because iver watched this show 4 times online and its probably the show that got me into anime so 5/5 it is, but the main purpose of this review was to ask a question, anyone know if this has both the Subbed and dubbed version of the show or just the subbed? I've seen both and they are both excellent, so having both would be great",1471737600,4,352,4.042857142857143

7752113,3,B01FXLRIKU,"The box came pretty busted up, the overall disc holder was broken (discs are still semi safe in each individual holder) and a large puncture in a corner of the box going through from cardboard through plastic.  I didn't want to risk and go through the trouble of asking a replacement, since the discs themselves had no damage.
The series itself is really good, a kind of action-romance--story of young love.  I knew it was good, having originally seen it on Toonami, which is why I made the purchase in the first place.  In my opinion its a more entertaining series than Evangellion or your other Mechas.  This and Mobile Suit Gundam are the few of the genre I'd invest in.",1502150400,2,673,4.537190082644628

7752120,4,B01FXLRIKU,"The lead character is a bit whiny and indecisive (like Senji in Neon Genesis). Who or what is Eureka? You'll have to watch to find out. And the Japanese pronunciation is not yu-REEK-ah (like the original Greek word meaning, ""I found it""). It's ay-oo-rek-ah said fast so it almost sounds like Erica.",1483488000,4,298,4.75

8761711,4,B01FXLRIKU,"I'm up to episode 30 so far and it's great.  I had actually bought episodes 1-30 on DVD many, many years ago and just found out I didn't have the whole show when I started watching it last month.  I ordered the whole thing on Blu-Ray, but when it arrived (today) it was completely crushed. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to ship a jewel case without any padding. Zero stars for the shipping.",1523318400,,404,4.166666666666667

8761713,2,B01FXLRIKU,"While I absolutely LOVE this series, I can't help but feel like I was ripped off. Around episode 5 of the first disc, the disc seems to randomly go into fast forward for minutes causing you to lose sound and portions of the episode. This ruins the  series for me. I don't want to watch it in soundless fast forward. Due to this ""glitch"" I'll  have to spend even more money to find a copy that actually works properly",1518393600,,416,4.253164556962025
