7826863,2,6302513383,Marylu Henner looks good in this movie with the sexy outfits that she wears but the plot is so lame in this movie all I got out of it was something about a expensive race horse that everyone is trying to get.  The humor is bad and the father on the eighties computer is really lame.  All of the actors look like they are ready to burst out laughing from the stupitity of this movie.,996192000,,382,4.08
