8197202,5,6304904495,"After watching this film you may ask yourself if the ""film makers"" intended it to be as funny as it is! The sheer amount of flash backs is sure to amaze anyone! Don't pass up this gem!--please file under direct to video satire--",985132800,2,228,4.325581395348837
8197203,3,6304904495,"This no budget American re-make of ""The Professional"" is hysterically (unintentionally?) funny.  Pointless flashbacks of scenes we just saw, actors improperly miked, bad lighting, over the top performances, stock explosions from other films, may very well make this the modern day ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  If you love bad film, this is a must own masterpiece.",985132800,2,362,5.333333333333333
8197204,2,6304904495,"Scott Baio is playing a ""tuff guy"" role, which of course is very different from the fun, light hearted charecters we are used to seeing him play, whom is trying to rid him self of a past he regrets. He has a ""dream"" for which he will do whatever it takes to acheive, even if it means continuing to face a past he is running from. For those Scott Baio fans-it's not his best acting, but the ""rugged"" look looks good on him.  I enjoyed the film simply because of being a fan of his.  Others would view the film as being generic.  It's definatly a ""B"" movie.",980208000,2,555,4.12037037037037
