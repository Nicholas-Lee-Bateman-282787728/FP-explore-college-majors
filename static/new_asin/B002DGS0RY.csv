8452385,5,B002DGS0RY,"I have been a fan of The Free Box Show since the earliest webisodes. The level of creativity and comedy throughout the show's run is consistently high. Featuring comedic situations from leprechauns and rotten milk to a genie in a bottle, Free Box delivers lots of laughs. With all of the self-indulgent bile people put on youtube these days, it is refreshing to see low-budget filmmakers who don't let their lack of budget keep them from doing wild, creative, and occasionally supernatural things on the show. The only thing wrong with this DVD is that it only contains the first 10 episodes. Granted - this is a solid 45 minutes to an hour of quality entertainment, but if you've seen the webisodes, it's hard to wait for the newer ones to get released to DVD (I believe they are up to 20 webisodes out on youtube). For the price though, this DVD is definitely worth picking up. I will also be buying the next 10 episode set when it comes out. Since episodes 11-20 have already been shot, hopefully this will be relatively soon. Until then, check out the webisodes on youtube by searching ""thefreeboxshow"".",1247702400,,1107,4.682051282051282
