4820371,5,B005LAJ17M,"Episode 1 of the new series for television HOMELAND has been aired and form the initial episode it appears that this will be an intensely interesting, psychological thriller.  All of the ingredients seem to be present - fine writing (Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff), fast paced direction by Michael Cuesta, and a very strong cast including Claire Danes in one of her most challenging roles, Damian Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.

The concept is very much in The public eye at this point - a study of how terrorists are followed and found and how the US Intelligence Service functions. The first episode introduces all of the main characters and fleshes out in a single episode the clues for all of the complicated substories and subplots that the series promises.  After eight years absence Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) was thought MIA but is discovered in a filthy cell in Iraq ad brought back to the US in a Marine Victory parade.  Brody had been captured with another Marine who was beaten to death and the reasons why Brody survived and his fellow Marine didn't makes CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) suspicious - could Brody have sold out to Iraqi bad guy Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban) and that is how he survived torture and captivity?  Anderson is driven to see if her concept is correct, gains the backing of her boss Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin, and successfully fills Brody's house with surveillance equipment so his every move can be observed. The sidebars include the fact that in Brody's absence his wife Jessica (Morena Baccarin) has fallen in love with Brody's best friend, and in the intense questioning and shock of being back home Brody begins to remember events of his capture and imprisonment including the fact that he was the one who beat his fellow Marine to death at the behest of Abu Nasir.  Brody's physical condition and body language also give signs that perhaps Anderson's concepts that Brody sold out to Abu Nazir and is plotting an attack on America are viable.  The stinger is that Anderson is discovered as being on antipsychotic medication since a young girl - making her contributions to intelligence under suspicion.  And so we are left with many possibilities for stories that will play out until this season's run ends in December.

It appears that this is a very strong series, but then some of the premiere shows of other series held great promise only to become ho-hum as the season ended.  Let's hope this isn't the case: the three main characters are so strong it would be a shame if their stories became diluted. Grady Harp, October 11",1317600000,51,2598,4.791946308724833

Surprised that this is such a hit.

4820480,5,B005LAJ17M,"Although this Season 1 BluRay first episode, scene 1 was startling and awkward, it laid the way for and was indicative of the jarring, off-centering story line that followed through the entire season.

British actor, Damian Lewis, who played Nicolas Brody, a US Marine Sergeant, rescued by Delta Force, had to develop and use an American accent to play his part. He never slipped in any of his American-English pronunciation and was totally believable as his character and carried out his military behavior to a T. His character development and story line was also totally believable.

Claire Danes character, Carrie Mathison, a CIA officer, was often pitted against but often with Many Patinkins character, Saul Berenson, a CIA ME Division Chief. The dialog between these 2 was a joy to watch. The back-forth between these 2 was in great repartee  sometimes in the manner of a superior; other times in the manner of an older person to one that is younger; and yet other times as friend-to-friend.

Brodys behavior with his wife, Jessica (played by Brazilian actress Morena Baccarin, who like Lewis had no trace of anything other than an American accent), was understandably fraught with problems. These problems were painfully being worked on by both characters for the sake of keeping the family unit in tact. There were many layers that Jessica had to get Brody to reconstruct in his behavior, and there were some that she tried to get him to deconstruct, so that she could better understand the person that he had now become.

Diego Klattenhoff, as Mike Faber, was a Marine Corps Captain and Brodys best friend. He, like Brody, kept a secret.

I have to admit that episode 1 was so gripping that we had to fight hard not to binge-watch the entire season at one time. Even after watching individual episodes, we needed to digest what we had seen and decompress.

To help us do that, we developed a strategy to continue with keeping up a driving storyline with another series. That was House of Cards (HOC), also season 1. This worked for us. After watching an episode of Homeland, we could keep up the same interest and pace with an episode of HOC. At the end of the 2 hours, it was if we had seen a film, and we felt OK about not binging, but we could take the time to discuss both. We also made a ritual of doing this only 1 night per week.

This spell-binding series seemed to have had its script almost lifted from the international news, and kept us glued to the next 3 seasons. I think that we are due for even more current seasons!

This is exactly the sort of series that is worthy of discussing with friends who also watch it.

This is an outstanding series. Season 1 was rated as the 2nd-best TV show in 2011.",1523232000,2,2722,4.616977225672878

Dane is a wonderful actress but has come a long way from Little Women and Temple Grandin and that is not a compliment. I couldn't get past the second episode with continuous profanity, excessive nudity, and limited quality screenwriting. The premise is quite disturbing in that if 50% of what is depicted is possibly true about radical muslims and our clandestine US organizations, the world is a very dark place and we are playing both edges of the sword. Law breaking to solve crimes is not justice or what America is really all about.

What idiotic BS. The truth, which many can't see through their rose colored glasses and haze of marijuana smoke, is that in reality, the jihadists are driven by a fanatical desire to create a worldwide caliphate. Their motivation has ZERO to do with United States foreign policy. And quite contrary to what these Pollyannas would have us believe, when we project WEAKNESS, it only makes the job of these jihadists easier.

It's no wonder that shows like this suck. Despite its slick production values, it doesn't hold up to scrutiny, and is downright stupid at times, and not just because of the twisted way the show reinforces the ""blame America"" sentiment. For one thing, we're expected to believe that a United States Marine Scout Sniper would only own a single personal firearm, a pistol, which he keeps in a lockbox, hidden in his garage. That's a bit like asking us to believe that a world class chef would keep nothing but a single paring knife in his home kitchen.

Bottom line, this is just another show in a long list which was ripped off from a foreign TV show, and the braindead hacks in Hollywood turned it into nothing more than a nighttime soap opera with a CIA theme, and not a very clever one at that. YAWN.",1488326400,3,1477,4.698841698841699

Overall the acting is poor, with a couple exceptions, and the show was a letdown. 3 stars is a gift because A) I really really wanted it to be good, and B) there has to be someplace worse to go for at least the next season and a half (after watching 2.5 seasons I'm done with this show completely).",1485648000,5,622,4.464912280701754

It really gets me thinking about our heroic military and law enforcement families and their sacrifices, what they face on a daily basis, and how twisted some evil people can be. Great plot-turn.

I've ordered Homeland Season 4, release was delayed but supposed to come out in January. I can hardly wait to get caught up on the story.",1480118400,,376,4.968253968253968
4822288,1,B005LAJ17M,"If you know anything, anything at all, about the military or intelligence work, if you speak Arabic or understand the Muslim world, if you live in or near Washington DC, or if you have personal experience with anything else this show attempts to deal with, you will hate, hate, hate Homeland Season 1. I can't speak for other seasons, because I haven't watched them and never will.

Let's start with Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis with an American accent), who is described by everyone, including himself, as a Marine Sergeant (E-5) but whose stripes vary in number. Indeed, he is most frequently seen in the uniform of a Gunnery Sergeant (E-7). His best and closest friend -- close enough to nearly marry Brody's wife when Brody appears to be dead, close enough to fistfight with -- is an officer. And everyone is fine with that. Why? Because the scriptwriters have obviously no notion of military discipline or fraternization regulations. Brody has a stay-at-home wife and two children who live in a spacious upper-income rambler with back to woods in a leafy Virginia suburb. Why? Because the scriptwriters have no concept of what an E-5 can afford. He runs for Congress... as a uniformed active duty Marine Sergeant, even making his announcement in full (Gunnery Sergeant) uniform, and everyone thinks it's a great idea. Why? Because the scriptwriters have no clue that that's illegal. While vacationing with his family in Gettysburg, he is recognized by locals who promise to vote for him. Why? I guess the scriptwriters don't realize Gettysburg is in Pennsylvania, two states away from Virginia. (""Oh honey,"" Brody demurs to his impressed wife, ""most of them probably don't even live in our district."" Ya think??)

Then there's Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes, chewing up the scenery), a CIA officer who keeps her job despite having mental health issues that stand out a country mile. Indeed, she has highly placed friends in the Agency actively covering up for her who, when everything comes out, miraculously keep their jobs when she loses hers. But never fear: I am reliably informed that she not only gets her clearance back, but despite highly visible meltdowns, is even handed a Chief of Station position in a sensitive post. Why? Because despite having CIA advisors, the scriptwriters have no apparent concept of anonymity or security requirements.

Carrie's mentor Saul (Mandy Patinkin) is a highly placed CIA Operations officer... whose wife is a citizen of India. And everyone is okay with that. Why? Because the scriptwriters don't know that CIA officers can't be married to foreign nationals. Not even Canadians.

If you live in the DC area, you know Farragut Square. You probably didn't know it was about four times its actual size, with grassy hills, a river, a bridge, a fountain and - this is crucial to the plot - its own parking lot. No statue of Admiral Farragut, but ample free parking, right in downtown DC. Why? Because Homeland used Charlotte, North Carolina for its ""Washington"" and the scriptwriters weren't even trying.

What the scriptwriters ARE trying is to shoehorn in more f-bombs than a second-grader who just learned the word. (There are two in the opening credits alone. No, really.) Everybody drops the big F: Men, women, children; Marines in front of women and civilians, doctors to patients, politicians in front of cameras. To show you how forced the effs really are, the script has a character in the season closer say this sentence, which I promise I am not making up: ""So the [F] what?"" I don't care how effed up your language, NObody has ever uttered the sentence ""So the [F] what?"" Except, of course, for one poor actor, who was visibly struggling to find some kind of intonation that might make that sentence work.

I won't get into the plot due to spoilers, even though the ""twists"" in Homeland are about as hard to see coming as a freight train on fire. Suffice it to say if you like rolling your eyes, pinching the bridge of your nose, shaking your head and sighing hard enough to bruise a lung, this show is for you.",1480032000,4,4066,4.86002886002886

4822350,3,B005LAJ17M,"Well, I'm shocked at how unoriginal and somewhat boring this show is. I've been waiting a while to finally watch this award winning show, only to be greatly disappointed.

4822355,4,B005LAJ17M,"The lead character is a female CIA agent, with more problems than Carter has liver pills, who insists on investigating an ex-POW suddenly released by terrorists. She believes he has been released back to the US to be a sleeper agent.  Her bosses demand that she cease the investigation, but she continues and it is revealed that he has very likely been brainwashed and released back to commit a terrorist act.

Sex-In the first three episodes, the viewer is treated to three beautiful women who fully expose their perfect tits.  One young gal is required to stand nude except for panties while being interviewed  for a ""position with the Prince"" by a female interview with a male overseer standing behind the interviewer.  The camera scans her body close up showing a very nice camel toe pressing against her thin panties. There was a lot of humping going but no genitals have been exposed.

Drugs-Thus far, the only drugs are alcohol and an anti-psychotic being taken by the lead character. She is dependent on the anti-psychotics and has been eating them like candy.  Her supply is getting low so we'll see if she goes whacko without them.

Rock and Roll-The background music is underwhelming. I was hoping for a sound track similar to Sopranos, but no such luck, at least not in the first season.

I just completed episodes 4 through 6.  Unlike E1-E3 there was no female nudity.  Oddly, there was sex when a drunk lead character Carrie encourages Brody, her prime suspect, to bone her in the back seat of a government Crown Vic.  He ejaculated in 15 seconds, so she got no pleasure from the act.  Carrie had knowledge that Brody was not F'ing his wife so she may have thought he was impotent. However, her intent was not pleasure, but to get close to Brody in order to gather information about him. It is clear that none of this was sanctioned by Carrie's bosses and she would likely be dismissed if it was found out.  During a lie detector test on Brody, Carrie suggested that they ask if he had every been unfaithful to his wife.  He responded no and the lie detector indicated he was truthful.  At that point, Carrie knew that he had been trained to beat lie detectors..  Her bosses were curious why she would suggest that question and she didn't answer.

I don't think this series is as good as it is cracked up to be. It has a reasonable amount of action, but nothing like 24. However, It is worth the price.",1478563200,,2416,4.579069767441861

4822401,5,B005LAJ17M,"This series was oddly addictive.  Best to binge watch a bunch at once because the plot is very dense and twisty.

At first the FBI agent character sounded whiny and silly to me but really it is taking a rather compassionate look at a person living and working with a mental illness (bi-polar disorder).  The returning POW (has he been ""turned"" or not?) character is played very well.  The issues of PTSD and re-acclamating to family and ""the real world"" are clear but in a understated multi-dimensional way.",1477958400,,507,4.7272727272727275

4822523,5,B005LAJ17M,"Five stars for excellent acting, I would give the plot four stars, but the acting is so good that it outweighs the inadequacies of the plot.  Claire Danes gives a totally unexpected (and incredibly well done) interpretation of a CIA operative with bipolar disease that compounds problems she has with the administrative side of the agency, as well as setting her up for an entanglement with the suspected terrorist an a modernized take on the Manchurian Candidate.  Having lived with a bipolar spouse for over 40 years helps me say I think Ms. Danes' characterization, while not spot on, is very well done, particularly as it reflects her inability to reflect on the impact of her own actions and her entanglement with the returned POW, Sergeant Brody.  In particular, her inability to distance herself from her attraction to Brody leads to opportunities for other members of the CIA to discount her perceptions, especially as Brody's motivations change through the course of his own experiences after his return from captivity.
I found the sequence surrounding Brody's decision not to carry out a suicide bombing to be especially well done, and the interaction between Brody and his daughter both surprising, surprisingly well done, and intensely moving.  I do feel that Damian Lewis is not up to the talents of Claire Danes, but he is nonetheless an excellent actor by Television standards.  The other surprising talent is Morgan Saylor as Dana Brody, who's interaction with her father as she becomes acquainted with his hidden side is especially well done, coming to a climax as she begs him to promise he will ""come home"".
I'm not sure how to take Mandy Patinkin's role as Carrie's (Claire Dane's character) supervisor or advisor (I was never sure which), Saul Berenson.  Is Saul so steeped in the secrecy of the agency that he can't be forthcoming with Carrie about his personal life?  Is the age gap, and his awareness of Carrie's instability, something that makes him unable to trust her?  Or is he, in fact, in love with her but feels their circumstances make any deeper involvement impossible?  I was left puzzled and dissatisfied by this aspect of the series.
After two years of the show, watched over a month or so, I'm a little tired by the constant tensions, so I intend to take a break for a couple of months.  I am sure I will be back, I have found myself somewhat entangled with Carrie Mathison (or is it Claire Danes?) such that I can't just back away.  The show is very intense, but I have enjoyed every minute, and am definitely signed on for the course.",1475798400,,2573,4.798642533936651
4822524,2,B005LAJ17M,"Clearly, this is great TV and superb drama... but I'll pass. Warning ... SPOILER... Stop reading now...

I never recovered from the fact that this war hero turns Muslim-terrorist just because a kid he liked was killed... Errr, sorry, I need a little more than that. The fact that this actor played  Mj. Winters in Band of Brothers (a favorite of mine) made it less palatable somehow... Irrational, perhaps, but, hey that's my personal taste. I guess I need a little more to convince me that a father of 2 can turn terrorist (and supposedly a patriot at the same time!).

I was also bothered by a missed opportunity in the series. It is about terrorism and CIA spies interacting with Muslim folks trying to prevent it. Yet not one time in the 8 episodes I saw do you have a Muslim fellow complain about the hijacking of his religion by these murderous beasts who kill and maim in the name of their religion. I know from Muslim friends that this is a concern of theirs. Where is that in the series? Why not have people turn informants precisely for that reason? I think that's a missed opportunity.",1475712000,6,1096,4.525252525252525

I cannot believe that any responsible agency would have someone as unbalanced and untrustworthy as Carrie, especially considering the major deceptions that she perpetuates.  I watched two full seasons and skipped around in the third (read synopses for all that I didn't watch), kept hoping to get to the episode where it became ""worth it."" That point never came. I quit watching in the middle of a huge clifhanger episode, and I could not care less about how it ended. I'm so disappointed in the very fine actors.

Somehow it was morally right to do then and not now?

Manny Patinkin is understated and powerful as Saul, and Damian Lewis is an intense actor who plays the role of a conflicted ex-POW well.  Claire Danes, in the role of the bi-polar protagonist, actually can actually make you think that she is ""crazy.""

The main issue that I have (and I have NOT yet seen the subsequent seasons) is that there are too many loose ends that are not explained at any point in the story line, even after the fact.  Other than creating a red herring, why was the house purchased in the Dulles flight paths.  What were the courses of career paths such that the Head of the CIA used to report to Saul, and now is his boss, and what caused the vest to malfunction  wires tend to be soldered together (not simply wrapped)?",1471046400,,794,4.404109589041096

It is about those things but in a great way - it's much more character driven and focuses on a handful of multi-faceted people. The story is complex enough to keep the viewer interested but not overly complicated to the point where it loses you. It's well acted, well written, well directed, and even has good original music.
