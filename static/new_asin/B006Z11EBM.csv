8506716,4,B006Z11EBM,"I purchased this direct from SW site during a sale for $35. It's a bit much at $60 for me. This is the sole reason for the 4 star which I think is fair. Alternatively I recommend their monthly fee and stream the courses you want which was what I was going to do until their sale happened. I wanted permanent access to their terminator skull course.

This dvd holds a wealth of knowledge on how to recreate the look of metal with paint. If you ask around you'll only get the most basic information: use black undercoat>clear coat(less often told this than not)>chrome paint. But this dvd will inform you what the pros do which is basically the same but with more steps and differing methods to achieve results. If your passion is to repaint a endo piece in your collection, or even to tackle other projects with a metal like finish(Predator bio mask for example, I haven't watched the course for it but I imagine it's basically the same techniques) you really need to check this course out.

It hurts to pay for it, less so if you pay their online course fee, but it's worth it. Afterwards there's no reason you can't accomplish professional results and greatly improve your projects and collectibles. If you were going to do the basic steps suggested to you on a project, I strongly recommend changing your mind and checking out this web course. Your finished projects will thank you later.

My one complaint about this course is that the fellow never mentions the brand of his airbrush as I wanted to buy one that was good enough for the pros. There are countless brands and it's impossible to figure out what they would use which I assume has to be a good product to use at the very least. Basically, they don't go into super great detail of everything they are doing. But it wasn't enough for me to take off any more stars. It's a five star product. I wish it were cheaper so I could award it the five stars...but there isn't $60 worth of knowledge here thanks to internet searches.

Strongly recommend their online courses to pay less for the infos.",1469232000,,2053,4.49597855227882
