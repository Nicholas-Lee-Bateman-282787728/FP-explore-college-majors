8226090,5,B000WYZ4H8,"I saw RT during this tour, though not at this venue, and this video of the concert is very true to his performances of the period.  This was before he developed the between-song patter he now employs, so the abrupt transitions between songs are appropriate.  Simply put, it is a treasure.  I won't go into much more detail, other than to say that all performances (especially those of Clive and Christine) are wonderful.  Though the concert was nearly 30 years ago, I can honestly say that I've never heard a better guitar solo than the one he turns in on ""You Don't Say.""

It's not a perfect video, especially when you consider all the non-concert shots edited in to illustrate some of the songs. But these are minor flaws and minimally disruptive to the overall flow.  The sound is very, very good for the time.  You also get to hear some earlier versions of his classics.

Though this video is also available on laserdisc (yes, I own the LD, along with  a couple functioning LD players), it has never been issued on DVD.  This is a shame.  My advice is to run out and get the VHS tape before there are no more functioning VCRs.",1388793600,,1130,4.463414634146342
