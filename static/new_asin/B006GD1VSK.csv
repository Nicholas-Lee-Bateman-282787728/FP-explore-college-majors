8497497,5,B006GD1VSK,"As a homeschool mom of middle school boys, I can say we all really like this program. It is the first subject of the day, and the boys jump right on it. Mr. Thomas is engaging and a good communicator. I especially appreciate that the boys are reviewing English grammar as a result of learning Latin. The translating lessons are based on the Latin Vulgate.  We will be continuing with the next set of lessons. Thanks, Mr. Thomas!",1366416000,,428,4.487179487179487
