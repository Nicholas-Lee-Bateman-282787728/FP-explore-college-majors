It doesn't always work, but when it does, as it does here (and even better in Aleksey Balabanov's far more horrific, but also more complex ""Cargo 200"") it can be a potent use of cinema.

A group of young Americans returning from Canada are kidnapped by a pair of ex-soldiers dressed as border guards. These men were in Iraq and at Guantanimo and want to continue the torture and 'information gathering' they were part of as soldiers. So in the name of protecting the country, they lock up and torture these kids, largely because the driver of the kids' truck has an Arab name.

And soon you realize, given the number of innocents its now acknowledged were (and probably still are) locked up among the real bad guys in the war against terror, that this nightmare isn't very far from real ones that real people are going through right now in the name of national security.

Surprisingly well acted for the budget and genre, as well as nicely shot, this certainly has moments where it shows its roots as low budget horror. There are awkward scenes, and forced bits of exposition. Logic gets stretched (but not too absurdly) at times. But it's not really all that gory (despite the allusions on the video box), and it's most effective terror is caused by tension and fear about what might happen, rather than any blood and guts you see.

Among other things, this is an interesting examination of what happens to borderline personalities who are given permission by their country to torture in the name of good. Will these people be able to let go of the monsters we willingly unleashed inside them?

Interesting (and telling?) that the film hasn't been released on video here in the U.S.",1430352000,,1814,4.6918238993710695
8464671,3,B005BZ6N2S,"The opening soundtrack sounds a bit different, having that weird combination of being both grindhouse and French. Unfortunately the movie doesn't maintain a heavy sound track.  5 people come back from Canada to the US and confront an odd out of the way border customs, which was really a road block and not a former customs station. Michael Mando plays Jalii Adel Kahlid one of the passengers. (Remind me never to travel across borders with a guy that has an Arab sounding name.) The border guard (Roc LaFortune) is unlikeable, but plays his part well.

When a small bag of pot is found in their luggage, the movie digresses into interesting if not unwarranted cavity searches. Nicole Leroux first. As things digress, 4 of surviving five are forced to dress in Guantanamo orange jumpsuits with non-matching head sacks that these border guards just happen to possess.

The movie jerks the camera around as a mechanism to generate ""fear"" but it was more annoying than anything. Alex Weiner plays an asthmatic mute (which he does well). He is the brother of Nicole Leroux. It was his pot that got them in trouble. The main part of the film is these four people locked away being tortured and interrogated in various stages of clothing. Stephen Shellen plays a private detective. He gives us some grindhouse philosophy, ""Life is about learning to die"" then he screws up the ending.

The movie, while having a grindhouse plot and nudity, it fails to use an effective soundtrack. Also the movie end abruptly, it seemed to have been cut short due to budget considerations. It was a 4 star grindhouse up to that point.

F-bomb, brief torture, nudity (Nicole Leroux, Michael Mando)",1321056000,2,1672,4.8321678321678325
