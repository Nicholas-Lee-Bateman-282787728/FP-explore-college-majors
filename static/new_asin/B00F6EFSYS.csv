Meditate or medicate before - you'll need patience to cull through the deluge of stream of consciousness (or unconsciousness).  Having said that, he's not stupid.  So I guess you get out of it what you put into it.  Like a dry college professional - hard to keep paying attention but if you do I suggest are things you would learn.  Good luck!",1464998400,,484,4.150537634408602

8612652,2,B00F6EFSYS,"Having read Melchizedek's books on sacred geometry. I found this rather slow going, too much messing about on the tape than solid info.
I think even a beginner would find it hard to find the realness of sacred geometry. I found it disappointing and nothing there to keep me interested
and wanting the next tape.

This looks like a promising video, but it is an extremely amateurish recording of a ""professor"" in a tiny classroom giving a lecture.  I've never seen a more random, rambling, kooky presentation. This video is unworthy of publication, let alone having to pay a fee to see it.  I'm surprised Amazon allows it on their website.",1383523200,5,400,4.768115942028985
