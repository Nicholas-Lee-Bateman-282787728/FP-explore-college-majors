4892299,4,B005TTEG5W,My wife and I enjoyed watching the first movie of the Mystery Woman Triple Feature and are looking forward to seeing the next two.  The only negative I have is that two of the three features are on a double sided disc (which could be damaged easier).  I see no reason why a third disc could not have been used.,1343347200,4,310,4.15

4892301,5,B005TTEG5W,"I am a great fan of the amazing sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the iconic TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-She-Wrote-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JN8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder, She Wrote - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;which ran for twelve seasons (and was followed by four TV movies). Since the show ended, I've been watching reruns and also checking out the DVDs from my local public library. I stumbled across the Mystery Woman series one day on the Hallmark Channel and promptly tivo-ed them all, a good thing since not all of the episodes are available on DVD.

The Mystery Woman investigative drama is kind of like a grown-up version of Nancy Drew. It stars Kellie Martin (who first impressed me in her portrayal of devoted schoolteacher Christy in the TV series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christy-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000LC4ZBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christy - The Complete Series</a>). Here she plays photographer Samantha Kinsey who inherits an old mystery bookstore from her deceased uncle. She renames it Mystery Woman Bookstore, and runs it with the help of an enigmatic assistant, Philby (Clarence Williams III) who is sort of a father figure to her. Just like the indomitable Ms. Fletcher, Samantha Kinsey finds herself being 'courted' by mysteries and uses her natural intuition and other sleuthing skills to solve baffling cases. She is assisted by her BFF and assistant to the DA, Cassie Hillman (Nina Siemaszko) who uses her position to help Samantha whenever she can.

This value set consists of three episodes:
Mystery Weekend
Snapshot
Sing Me a Murder

The following are the episodes as they were screened:
Mystery Woman (2003 - had different actors playing Philby and Cassie)
Mystery Woman: Mystery Weekend (2005)
Mystery Woman: Snapshot (2005)
Mystery Woman: Sing Me a Murder (2005)
Mystery Woman: Vision of a Murder (2005)
Mystery Woman: Game Time (2005)
Mystery Woman: At First Sight (2006)
Mystery Woman: Wild West Mystery (2006)
Mystery Woman: Oh Baby (2006)
Mystery Woman: Redemption (2006)
Mystery Woman: In the Shadows (2007)

Hallmark Channel shows the episodes every once in a while and I've been recording them off-air. Though not quite as engaging as Murder, She Wrote (I don't feel there ever will be a series quite like that again, and I so miss Cabot Cove!), Mystery Woman has a strong lead in Kellie Martin and a good supporting cast in the actors who play Philby and Cassie. Unlike Murder, She Wrote there is no real development of other characters that live in the town where Samantha lives. Each movie is stand-alone and one doesn't really need to watch the shows in order, though the first episode does provide some background info on Samantha.

I'd recommend this series of movies for those who love cozy mysteries.",1336953600,108,2889,5.5867579908675795
4892302,4,B005TTEG5W,"The ""Mystery Woman"" series stars Kellie Martin as Samantha Kinsey, a photographer, owner of a book store, and lover of mysteries, who gets involved in the solving of crimes.  Martin first assumed the role in ""Mystery Woman"" (2003) a production for the Hallmark Channel, and has so far appeared in ten successive Mystery Woman movies.  This DVD collection contains&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Woman-Mystery-Weekend/dp/B000EWBO7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Woman: Mystery Weekend</a>&nbsp;(2005),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Woman-Snapshot/dp/B000FDEVAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Woman: Snapshot</a>&nbsp;(2005), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Woman-Sing-Me-a-Murder/dp/B000ION276/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Woman - Sing Me a Murder</a>&nbsp;(2005), which are the second, third, and fourth entries in the series.

Samantha Kinsey follows in the tradition of many other amateur sleuths, such as Jessica Fletcher from Murder She Wrote, who in the course of her normal life, gets entangled in various crimes and mysteries.  Samantha gets support and valuable advice from Philby, who manages the bookstore, and is played by Clarence Williams III (Mod Squad).  Every detective needs connections with the law.  Sam's close friend Cassie Hillman (Nina Siemaszko) is an assistant to the local DA, and she also has a lively relationship with Police Chief Connors (Casey Sander).

The Mystery Woman movies seem to be influenced by the success of Murder She Wrote, although featuring a younger heroine.  Mystery Woman has a gentle folksy feel similar to Cabot Cove, where the intrusion of violence, usually causes a major disturbance.  The movies have that made for cable TV vibe, where something exciting usually happens just before the commercial break, which means that things are typically quite lively.  The stories are generally well written and acted, and feature some familiar names like Kari Wuhrer, David Naughton, Deborah Van Valkenburg, John Getz, and Patty McCormack.

Kellie Martin is a likeable and very talented actress, and even directs some of the succeeding ""Mystery Woman"" movies.  She already had tons of TV credits, but many became familiar with Martin when she appeared on ER for two seasons (1998-2000), playing Lucy Knight, a medical student who was tragically murdered.  Clarence Williams III, who played Lincoln Hayes on The Mod Squad (1968-1973), is a unique talent, and he and Martin seem to have excellent rapport, as a very offbeat crime solving team.

If you enjoy Miss Marple, or detective programs like Murder She Wrote, The Father Dowling Mysteries, or Diagnosis Murder, you might enjoy Mystery Woman.  The two disc Mystery Woman Triple Feature, is a pretty economical way to get these three movies, which have been available for several years.  It's been a little while, but unfortunately for fans of Samantha Kinsey, the remaining Mystery Woman movies have yet to be released.",1333411200,47,3091,6.203747072599532

As in most Hallmark fare, this is good family entertainment.  The quality of the DVD is very good and at about two dollars a movie is worth viewing.",1452211200,,524,4.484210526315789

4892358,2,B005TTEG5W,"This review is for the dvd set itself, not the movies.  The quality of the film is not good.  It's a bit fuzzy and pixilated.  Definitely nothing like HD.  The set of 3 dvds comes in one case, and the disks are stacked one on top of the other.  I have never seen that configuratin before and I don't like it.  In fact, it seems more likely that the dvds will scratch.  Over all, a very poor job of copying and packaging these movies.

Now, for the movie reviews.  I'd give the movies 3 stars.  The stories are weak and many of the characters and actors are also weak.  I like Kellie Martin and I like mysteries and I liked the premise of a woman who owns a Mystery Book store, herself becoming something of a sleuth.  It's too bad the script writing wasn't stronger and the selection of actors, better.  Overall, pretty average.",1440979200,,828,4.298701298701299

4892365,4,B005TTEG5W,"Overall this is pretty harmless decent entertainment. Kinda cookie cutter gingerbread all is nice in fake land type of stuff. I usually like my entertainment that way as it is escapism after all.

You see everyone as happy and all smiles, getting along. Everyone is slim and good looking. No handicaps here. No protestors here. No unions here. Blacks in this town are ""whitewashed""--they mingle among the whites of the town being best friends. You cannot tell anyone apart except for appearance. The African American characters are Cosby Show like:  all are intelligent mystery solvers, upscale b&b owners, etc. They remind me of how liberals think of them in reality which is a little off putting because it is so dishonest and politically motivated. No short shorts and halter tops here. No profane tee-shirts. This is not the land of silicone and botox lips. They all live in beautiful homes with beautiful furnishings. Quiet tree lined streets. I mean it is escapism.

However, I must say that in their attempt to not be shocking or shocked at anything they sorta gloss over some scenes that took me aback. The idea that some druggie hippies who slept around with each other are just sitting around talking about it like it is just normal everyday tea time chatter is a little stepford. The scene where the man is grabbed and the big butcher knife comes into the side of his neck as  you hear the sound effects of a watermelon being sliced open is more than disturbing, even more so for a show like t his--it is creepy.

The characters are somewhat clownish in some scenes. Or maybe it is the acting? The main woman's role runs around like the girl next door as clueless as we are. She is normal. Then at the end she transforms into this self-confident steely eyed Ill-tell-you-a-thing-or-two person. The main guy in the bookstore . . . he has this mechanical look to him. He stares at people. Nothing moves on his face but his lips. His eyes are wide open. He never bats his eyelids. Just stands there. Weirdo.

Anyway nothing too earth shattering here. It is just that some of these shows like this where they try to be non-offensive (which is really really really good) come off a little warped and eerie in places.",1436832000,,2222,4.670076726342711

4892443,5,B005TTEG5W,"Mystery Woman is a Hallmark Channel original series that was on a few years back.  It, along with McBride and Jane Doe, was a nice little cozy mystery tri-fecta that I was hoping would come to video.  All three were entertaining to watch.  Mystery Woman starred Kellie Martin as the owner of a small town book shop who, aided by her ex-spy co-worker (played by Clarence Williams III), solved mysteries that came up around town.  This DVD is a delightful collection of three of the episodes from the series and is priced right for the picking.",1404950400,,542,4.614583333333333

4892449,5,B005TTEG5W,"This set of three mysteries was recommended to me by Amazon based upon my purchasing history.  I had never hear of the series so I was a bit unsure as to whether I would enjoy them or not.  It turns out it was a great recommendation by Amazon.  Not only have I enjoyed the three movies in this set, I can't wait until the others are released.

The set consists of two DVDs in a well constructed case.  The quality of the video and sound is excellent.

The Mystery Woman series was originally produced by the Hallmark Chanel.  The series consists of a pilot and 10 movies.  The pilot aired in 2003 with the 10 movies following in the 2005 - 2007 time frame.

The series stars Kellie Martin of ER fame as Samantha Kinsey.  She inherited a mystery bookstore from her uncle and now runs it.

There are three additional main characters in addition to Samantha:
  Philby - He is the store caretaker.  He is played by Clarence Williams III of 1970's Mod Squad fame.
  Cassie Hillman - She is Samatha's best friend and the Assistant D.A.
  Chief Connors - He is the Police Chie whome Samantha proves wrong more often than not.

Philby and Cassie were played by different actors in the pilot as compared to the 10 follow-up movies.

The 11 titles are:
  Mystery Woman - Pilot
  Mystery Weekend
  Snapshot
  Sing Me a Murder
  Vision of a Murder
  Game Time
  At First Sight
  Wild West Mystery
  Oh Baby
  Redemption
  In the Shadows

All mysteries are complex, well thought out and well acted.  It is difficult to figure these out in advance.

Highly recommended for any mystery fan.",1397952000,6,1575,4.4678571428571425
4892450,5,B005TTEG5W,Kellie Martin is one of my favorite actors from her E.R. and Christy and Hallmark movie days and on.  The Mystery Woman series just keeps her in the limelight.  I like the stories and her supporting cast of characters.  Great chemistry.  Enjoy!,1393286400,,244,4.738095238095238
4892451,4,B005TTEG5W,"Well produced dvd.
Dvd contains 3 full length episodes - each one 1 hour 30 minutes.
Classical mystery fiction.
Seems good investment.
There is a downside - no subtitles.",1393286400,,170,4.896551724137931
4892452,5,B005TTEG5W,"There are few movie makers as insightful as Hallmark--and it doesn't have to be about gut wrenching love either--like this particular series (and the Jane Doe series with Lea Thompson).  I don't know how they do it.  It is heart wrenching to fans like myself, however, not to be able to purchase every single thing they've ever made (there are millions of us who bemoan this fact all the time as we stand in bookstores complaining about it)--which made the purchase of this trilogy the best thing that's happened to me in a while.  I like this series.  Kelly Martin has always been intriguing in her roles.  She's not the traditional female by any stretch of the imagination, not cruel, bitter, or always willing to pick a fight.  She's a hardliner, though (nice touch), in a cute package.  There's no sweetsie crap going on with this mystery woman--but she's not heartless.  She is obsessed, which only adds to her charm, even though you do want to smack her every once in a while.  She's dedicated, what can I say?  If you want some good mystery without all the angst and non-essential life-affirming dialogue--this is your ticket. I'd say this is one of those things that's more like reality than reality TV--done the real way humans relate to each other in situations like these.",1393027200,,1283,4.713004484304933
4892453,4,B005TTEG5W,"The eleven television movies which make up the complete Hallmark Mystery Woman series is almost always entertaining but never up to the standard of the best British and American products of similar genre. One factor working against them is that the choice of stories and the presentation of them militates against sharply etched conflicts, bitter emotional conflict, and other disturbing elements which mark superior works. Another is the absence of a strong central character to carry the show. The lead is acceptable, but lacks  the strength and presence of A Star, someone who can do the heavy lifting. She is good enough to keep it watchable but not to bear the weight of invigorating all her scenes...which are the heart of the movies. Clarence Williams III does perform admirably in the limited role of sidekick but again is allowed limited range of emotion and limited time. Both these actors may simply be cut down to fit the concept of how the shows should be presented. Stories are interesting and supporting players capable. Overall, they  (and these three, of course) are Hallmark productions, that is, they do seek to provide the quality that Hallmark wants to be associated with its name, but that prevents a degree of innovativeness and daring  which would make them memorable.
I can commend these three films as worthy of being the centerpiece of an evening of television. They will not keep you on the edge of your seats but are likely to be enjoyable.",1392076800,,1469,4.915322580645161
4892454,5,B005TTEG5W,"Great series, but unfortunately I bought to soon.  They have another DVD out that has the entire series on it and I missed out.

4892457,2,B005TTEG5W,"I have really enjoyed the many Hallmark movies I've seen, but...the Mystery Woman episode ""Sing Me a Murder"" was, well, a stinker.  Trite, boring, not worth the time.  Lovely setting, nice to see Clarence Williams III, but this one was lame.  It has turned me off from watching the other two episodes in the trilogy.  But it won't turn me off Hallmark.",1388880000,,352,4.629032258064516
4892458,3,B005TTEG5W,"On the strongly positive side, I like Clarence Williams III very, very much. I remember him from Mod Squad -- loved him then, love him now.  And I like Kellie Martin; she's cute and spunky.  But the plots and overall directing leave, for me, something to be desired.  I find the plots both light-weight and confusing.  You'd think that if something is light-weight it should be easy to follow, but I found myself having to back-track to fully figure things out.  But maybe that's because I wasn't totally engaged to begin with...",1388620800,7,529,4.706521739130435

We have been fans of this series and were happy to find at least three episodes on DVD. The quality of the picture on the DVD is far superior to the TV versions over Dish Network. The picture is crisp with more details showing to make it a better viewing experience.  We could see the individual detail of the books on the shelves of the bookstore, where on Dish they are usually blurred for example.

From the main character, who owns a mystery book store named ""Mystery Woman,"" the best friend whose a DA, the surly Police Detective to the mysterious shop assistant/spy, these are good/fun characters who grow through the series of TV movies.

These are comfortable, cozy mysteries that are great for a rainy or snowy day when you're not really into picking up a book, but want something that's not too deep, but sort of challenging and mysterious. Some of my favorites, and I'll admit it, I am a fan of Cozy Mysteries.",1372896000,7,613,4.728971962616822
4892480,4,B005TTEG5W,"""Mystery Woman"" used to feature made-for-television movies on one of the cable ""networks""  back around the latest turn of the century and my wife, who is a mystery addict, loved them. Now that we're getting used to retirement, I wanted some cheap mysteries for my wife, so she wouldn't play the same two seasons of ""Murder, She Wrote"" over and over again like a four year old girl with a copy of ""The Little Mermaid"", and the ""Mystery Woman Triple Feature"" was priced very cheaply.

  As it turns out, the series was much better than I had feared and has none of the cloying sweetness of ""Murder, She Wrote"" or a couple of other television detective series my wife has followed over the years. The scripts are pretty good, the stories feature Clarence Williams III who has turned into a very watchable actor, and the cast of each of the stories is solid . The movies aren't top flight entertainment but they are superior of their kind and are a pleasant way to kill eighty minutes or so.  I'm actually looking forward to seeing all three stories again which is good, since it is inevitable that I'll have plenty of chances to do so. Highly recommended for mystery buffs.",1372550400,,1170,4.578947368421052
