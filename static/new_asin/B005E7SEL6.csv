8467940,4,B005E7SEL6,"Interesting indie flick about some eccentric fellers.  Imagine the love child of Mifune and The Royal Tennenbaums.  Got it?  Yeah, that would be Septien.",1500163200,,153,5.291666666666667
8467941,1,B005E7SEL6,I was flipping through the movie channels looking for a movie to watch. The description said *After 18 years a man returns home looking to seek revenge on the town that wronged him with the help of his 2 deranged brothers-Horror* I thought now that sounds AWESOME!!! After watching Septien I thought WTF!? This was NOT a horror flick. It wasn't scary. It wasn't gory. It was a rip off! It was way different then what I expected. It was weird & a waste of time & I was majorly disappointed,1432080000,,488,4.373626373626373
8467942,5,B005E7SEL6,"A wonderful flick about the joys of life. Its the little things that should not be overlooked and septien shows us that. Family, tradition, and celebration are things we should not take for granted. If you have not seen this movie, you should. It has something for everyone. Thank you Mr. Robert Longstreet for your brilliant story.",1418688000,,332,4.842105263157895
8467943,5,B005E7SEL6,"The movie is set in the poor, rural south. Former high school sports star, now alcoholic/addict drifter, Cornelius(Tully) returns to his childhood home after having disappeared for 18 years. His two gay brothers live there along with a big, innocent , mentally retarded guy who sleeps in a tractor tire in the yard. This is a very character driven film.

Cornelius is a man of few words, who hustles people in pick up sports to finance his malt liquor and gasoline addictions. Ezra (Longstreet) is your typical queen who likes to wear dresses and pretend to be Susan Brady; he acts like a mother, maintaining the house and putting food on the table. Amos (Tukel) is the lazy artist brother; he draws violent sexual artwork, full of bleeding limbs and penises that reflects on his own damaged psyche. He also harbors an attraction to his brother. Wilbur is the big retarded guy, with the mind of a child. He likes to feed stray kittens but occasionally says profound things.

Without spoiling the plot I must say this movie is a work of genius. It is full of sweaty, rural south dirtiness; with the poorness,incest,huffing,fire and brimstone, demons, etc....This movie is full of three legged dogs with fleas. Either you will get it or you won't. The jokes aren't spoonfed, and the symbolism isn't either. It is extremely funny yet poignant at the same time. This one completely flew under the radar, you have to watch it before you die.",1407888000,,1436,4.763052208835341
8467944,2,B005E7SEL6,"Did I really watch this?  Looks like it was filmed in some ole Coots unkempt Tennessee back yard.  High school coach played Catholic Priest with one of the boys at least, and so the guilt drives the boy away for 18 years.  He returns and a Demon Purger shows up out of nowhere and gets them to have the coach over for Ernest Angley hour by the Bon fire where redemption is found by all.  EVIL SPIRITS COME OUT!  SAY BABY . . . UNGH.  THAT's  RIGHT . . . BABY!

If they failed to pay the exorcist do they get repossessed?",1366502400,,520,4.029411764705882
8467945,4,B005E7SEL6,"If you hope to avoid violent sexual surrealist paintings or former victims of child sexual abuse, this film isn't for you.  These 3 brothers are all ""crazier'n sheethouse rats"" as one character puts it watching a flavor of family dysfunction very few films get.  It's not unlike the symbolism of ""Tideland"" by Terry Gilliam.",1357257600,,324,4.981481481481482
8467946,4,B005E7SEL6,"This is an interesting film if you haven't read what it is about as you try to solve a mystery. Cornelius Rawlings (Michael Tully) returns home after an 18 year hiatus. He is moody and still has his demons. Why if left is unknown and why he bothered to come back is even more of a mystery. We find out that while in high school he was a jock. His brother Ezra (Robert Longstreet) has assumed the role of the family patriarch or matriarch. He attends church and is overly neat to the point of being a stereotypical gay. Brother Amos (Onur Tukel) has issues too. He spends his time in a shed making horrible drawings that depict sex and dismemberment. Wilbur Cunningham (Jim Willingham) is mentally slow and lives outside in a large truck tire.

The characters are ""Scott Pilgrim"" quirky, but clearly they have far deeper and darker issues. You want to know about their past which has shaped their present. The art show was totally bizarre. The movie was shot cheaply on 16MM for effect. This is a film for extreme indy lovers. Characters were well played.

F-bomb, only drawn nudity and sex...and rather poorly.",1333497600,2,1110,4.601010101010101
8467947,1,B005E7SEL6,"Four brothers on a farm. A gasoline sniffing, tennis and hoops hustling Jesus type who wanders around for no reason; a penis fixated artist; a not-quite-there junk searching metal detector user; a cross dresser. A neighbor older plumber who raises everyone's ire by being too close to his attractive younger adopted niece? A preacher who shows up to exorcise the plumber. If there's symbolism here then I'm throwing away all my Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy novels.

Whatever the story was i couldn't maintain enough time and interest to sort it out.",1329264000,,550,5.111111111111111
8467948,4,B005E7SEL6,"I was immediately drawn into the film Septien as the beginning credits were rolling because of the Bizarre yet Fascinating artwork that was featured. As I watched I realized they were painted by a main character the film surrounds itself around.
The art was genius in a sick kind of way.
The story focuses on 4 brothers who all have serious issues that slowly unfold as the film progresses.
One of the brothers returns after being gone for fifteen years and is welcomed back like it had only been a time span of six month or so.
I don't want to reveal much but it was billed as a Horror film ,I would not say it was in any kind of Horror Sub Genre but a mystery,Psychological drama with just enough  Black comedy thrown in to keep it balanced. Listen very carefully to some of the dialogue and your jaw will drop plus there are a couple of scenes that are jaw dropping as well.
I was sucked in and even though it was quite slow paced I didn't even want to stop it for a bathroom break afraid I was going to miss the big payoff.
By the end you pretty much figure out what is and what isn't and the way they slowly slipped in pieces of the puzzle was subtly genius.",1324598400,4,1163,4.191964285714286
