2711109,3,B000LOQIMY,"Maria (Soledad Villamil) is going through a crisis. There's something missing in her life, and she's on a mission to fill the void.

At first, she thinks she may be more fulfilled if she has her breasts enlarged.  But, no.  She soon realizes that wasn't what she needed.

She then decides her happiness depends on marriage with her live in boyfriend, Javier (Diego Peretti).  And, once the knot is tied she wants them to leave Buenos Aires  and move to Miami.

Javier is shocked when she springs her plan on him.  He has a wonderful career as a surgeon, and a lifetime of local connections.  He has no urge to marry or to move away.  But in the end he decides to give in to Maria's nagging and off they go for a quick courthouse wedding.

Once they are married, Javier decides Maria was right all along.  He's happy that they've made the commitment and, while nervous about moving to a country where he knows no one and doesn't speak the language, he's willing to believe that Maria may be right about this, too.

Some years ago Maria lived in Miami.  She has some knowledge of English, and has maintained some connections there over the years.  So, she decides that it would be best if she moves first and gets settled and that Javier join her later.  So, off she goes...leaving her lonely groom behind.

At first Maria's calls home to Javier are filled with excitement and enthusiasm.  She's found a great apartment; her friends have loaned her a car; and she even has a hot job lead for Javier.

Eventually, it's time for them to reunite.  Javier sells the Buenos Aires apartment, gives notice at the hospital where he works, and buys a plane ticket for Miami.

Luis (Hernn Jimnez), Javier's best friend offers to take him to the airport.  In a very funny scene, Luis arrives to pick up Javier and his luggage. He finds his friend jamming his suitcase full of jars of dulce de leche, bags of mate, and boxes of alfajores.  Javier points out that an Argentine in Maimi need not starve.

On the road to the airport, Maria phones.  Something is wrong.  She won't tell Javier what the problem is, but she finally tells him not to get on the plane.  She'll call him later to explain.  WIth no apartment, no job, and an uncertain future, Javier goes to his parents' home to await another call from his wife.

Over the following days and weeks, Maria's calls become less frequent.  Although she aludes to her feelings, emotions, and vague pyschology terms, Maria never really tells Javier what caused her cold feet.  Apparently she has found what was previously missing from her life though - and she doesn't need a husband after all.

Javier loves Maria.  He wants to be an understanding husband and give her emotional support, but he has no idea what she needs or wants, or what she is trying to communicate when she phones him.  Meanwhile, he also has to try to get his old job back and find a place to live - never knowing when or if he is going to get the call to fly to Miami.

Having exhausted the patience of his family and friends with his never ending speculation on the state of his marriage, Javier at last resorts to professional help.  The tortured sessions with his psychoanalyst, Analista (Marcos Mundstock) are the best in the film, as Javier tries to find enough closure to rebuild his life.

""No Sos Vos Soy Yo"" has an excellent cast.  Villamil is grating and annoying, but that's completely in character. Peretti is believable as the utterly confused husband, vacillating between anger and pain. The supporting characters who have to deal with all this angst have some funny moments.

The DVD quality is excellent. There are special features, including a ""Making of..."" but no director's commentary.

The movie won three awards at the 2005 Lleida Latin-American Film Festival, including Best Actor for Peretti, Best First Work and Audience Award for director, Juan Taratuto.

Personally, I thought the comic moments in the film nearly drowned in the seemingly endless complaints and whining. It reminded me of the type of film Alan Alda made in the 1970's. Maybe there's a little too much reality in this comedy? Even though ""No Sos Vos, Soy Yo"" is an award winning movie with a lot of fans, it isn't for everyone.

2711114,4,B000LOQIMY,"The high-definition revivals continue with Scream Factorys Carrie / The Rage: Carrie 2 Double Feature. Before everybody starts salivating and hopping up and down in rabid anticipation of new behind-the-scenes featurettes and cast and crew interviews for Brian De Palmas 1976 classic, be warned this collection contains the 2002 TV-movie originally planned as a back-door pilot for a series. I was disappointed as well, but found the version included here to be better than many give it credit as being.

In the made-for-TV movie Carrie, our young naive outcast (Angela Bettis) is tormented by her fellow high-school students. She learns of her telekinesis and begins using it as a tool for vengeance.

The 2002 version of Stephen Kings Carrie is a lot better than it couldve been. It was already fighting an uphill battle trying to recapture the same tense and gloriously haunting magic the 1976 movie did. Weak performances and cheesy dialogue by many of the actors doesnt help the situation. However, Angela Bettiss incredible performance as the title character virtually redeems any weakness shown by the other cast members. The one thing that hinders this update is the TV-quality production and cinematography. That being said, the special effects are a lot better than they shouldve been for a TV-movie made in the early 2000s.

The Rage: Carrie 2 centers on the quiet and bookish Rachel Lang (Emily Bergl). Her closest friend commits suicide after being manipulated by the popular crowd. She decides to get back at the guilty parties. Although Rachel falls for sensitive football player Jesse Ryan (Jason London), she remains determined to punish his callous friends. When the spurned girl discovers that she has superhuman abilities, it ups the stakes for her revenge, echoing a supernatural incident that occurred decades before.

This sequel isn't the quality follow-up most movie buffs want who revere the original as a horror masterpiece. Its ties to the first film are what will keep older viewers interested in what is really a 1990s teen genre flick. The MTV-video styled cinematography is a good indication of what the filmmakers were going for at the time. However, I still enjoy it for what it is and find it a satisfying watch as long as you don't position yourself under the shadow of Brian De Palmas classic.

Although 2002s Carrie is rated TV-14 and includes some questionable content for younger viewers. Theres brief nudity, although nothing graphic is shown. The scenes are from the back or a profile of Carrie lying in the fetal position in the shower. There are adult situations, violence and gore, mild profanity, alcohol and smoking, and frightening and intense scenes. The Rage: Carrie 2 is rated R for strong graphic horror violence and gore, brief strong sexuality, and language. Things get rather bloody whenever our angry anti-hero starts acting out her vengeance.

Scream Factorys Carrie / The Rage: Carrie 2 Double Feature Blu-ray includes some interesting bonus material. New audio commentary is provided by Director David Carson for 2002s Carrie. A trailer is also included. Director Katt Shea provides new audio commentary for The Rage: Carrie 2. An alternate ending with a Before and After special effects sequence, additional scenes not seen in theaters and a theatrical trailer are found for the sequel as well.

I freely admit that Scream Factorys Carrie / The Rage: Carrie 2 Double Feature Blu-ray wouldve been a lot more thrilling if it included Brian De Palmas 1976 film instead of the 2002 TV-movie. If you give the update a chance, youll find that it really isn't as bad as history remembers it. Although its not of the same quality as its predecessor, The Rage: Carrie 2 still holds up well and will better relate to the MTV generation and even younger viewers now.",1431129600,3,3814,5.044444444444444

One Great thing when you buy direct from Scream Factory you'll get the Items 2 weeks early
This is Scream Factory's Best Bang for your Buck as far as BR Double Feature go IMO
The **New** Exclusive extras are worth the Purchase

Carrie as a Brand already has 4Films with the Iconic Name Licensed and Financed.....
Each Film is the Same But, Not the same all 4 Films deserve more Respect for having such a ""Real"" Deep Social Commentary

  I wish Scream would've been able to get Star Emily Bergl to due a Audio Commentary on the Rage 2

The Breakdown of these Film are simple They are Carrie sequels/tie-ins, Re-Boots whatever you call them in 2015

The Carrie (2002) tv-remake is actually very underrated and hated just to be hated (which is a real Shame) Cause it's The Classic Carrie tale re-worked and told with some cleaver plot twist! some of the Digital F/X look a bit bad But, it can be forgiven

The Rage: Carrie 2 is just a close to Perfect Sequel (That also gets more Hate then Love)
Emily Bergl was the BEST Carrie since the Original she just has this Goth Hotness to her  (Emily Bergl & Fairuza Balk are BOTH two super under-rated actresses That did  Hot Goth better then anyone else still to this day)
I watched half The Rage the HD Remastering looks really good
It has Never looked this Good Scream once again did a Great Job
  I'm very happy with this Purchase  9.5/10

2711120,3,B000LOQIMY,"The basic plot of the movie has already been reviewed so this is geared toward the Spanish teacher. Javi is probably 20 years older than 1st bride, Maria, or his second bride, Julia, both in their 20s. His rants about women are going to be beyond the experience of high schoolers. While older viewers will find his dropping in constantly on his best friend, wife, and child funny, younger (under 25ish) won't. The scenes when he's moved back home to his old room, frozen in time at about high school complete with a shark poster on the door, also won't be as funny to younger viewers.

There are some passionate scenes but in most the people are covered with some clothing. Maria (1st wife) runs around in a bra and panties. The language has some terms for body parts and other ""bad"" language. No drugs. No violence. Javi's parents have become Buddists and a little bit of the religion is discussed. Javi's dog does give birth but nothing really messy to see there. There are scenes with drinking, some to the point of drunkeness.

Overall, with more life experience it's a funny movie. High schoolers haven't lived enough to appreciate it and will be bored.",1305763200,3,1158,4.64390243902439

8162500,2,B000LOQIMY,"When you choose to make a remake of a classic film the main goal should always be to either bring something new to the table or to create something so fresh that it makes viewers forget about the original. Unfortunately all involved with the remake of CARRIE decided to do neither of those things. Instead what we ended up with was a TV movie that stretched out the story to an unbearable 3 hour length whose only hope of saving grace was the performance of Angela Bettis in the lead. While she turns in a decent performance it to adds nothing to the original and simply makes you long for that film instead.

If you don't know the story, based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King, it tells the story of Carrie White, a pubescent young woman whose mother is a control freak and religious fanatic to the extreme. Carrie is an odd girl and the rest of the kids in her class fully make her aware of that every chance they get. An incident involving her having her first period in the girls shower after gym class leads the girls to torment her rather than sympathize with her. That in turn results in several expulsions from the prom for which the lead tormentor plans revenge.

What most aren't aware of in the school, something Carrie herself is only beginning to realize, is that Carrie has powers that make her special. Carrie has telekinesis, the ability to move objects with her mind. Her mother tells her its the devil in her, but Carrie knows it is just an ability she was born with.
Chances are when the prom rolls around and the bad girl seeks out her revenge the power that Carrie possesses will be unleashed in heretofore unseen strength.

The problem is in making the movie into a two night event (something they always feel the need to do with TV movies) the makers of this film relied on people coming back for night 2 to see what happened. As slow moving and boring as night 1 was I wouldnt have come back. The movie has no need to last this long and fills as if filler were the name of the game here. Instead of a concise story we get a rehash of the original film with no outstanding new effects, no additional plot involvement and some of the lamest acting Ive seen in a made for TV movie. Even Bettis who has a strong cult following for her performances in other films doesnt live up to expectations. When all is said and done, this movie is one to pass by. The only thing added? SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! Greedy TV movies producers leave an opening for a sequel. Thank goodness it never really happened.

So what is THE RAGE: CARRIE 2 then? Well a completely different movie with a one or two things carried over from the original film. Emily Bergl plays Rachel Lang, an outsider in a world of stereotypical teens in high school. Her best friend Lisa (Mena Suvari) commits suicide when she becomes a notation in a game being played by the high school football team. Each one attempts to bed down all girls in the school with a point system attached to various girls. Lisa thought it was love but it was just part of the game.

Rachel is filled with anger. Maybe rage is a better word since thats the name of the movie. Rachel also has ties to Carrie White somehow and has that same telekinetic power that Carrie did. The only other tie to the original is the inclusion of Amy Irving as Sue Snell, Carries best friend from the original film. She is now a counselor at the new high school, built after Carrie burned down the old one. Recognizing possible problems with Rachel, she tries to help her through the loss of her friend and potential powers.

Eventually you know that the football team will do something stupid to cause her powers to erupt. Only one member of the team isn't like the rest, Jesse (Jason London). In love with Rachel it becomes a question of whether shell believe his infatuation with her or think of him as just another part of the crowd. And when the final straw is broken by these jerk jocks (unless its a tribute movie aren't they always depicted this way?), it is doubtful that any will survive Rachels rage. See how I worked that title in again there?

The movie isn't quite as bad as I might portray it here but its not fantastic either. At least it makes an attempt at something different as opposed to the other movie in this double feature disc from Shout/Scream Factory. While they do their best to make movies available for fans out there I wouldnt suggest that anyone else rush out to buy this combo. Collectors of all things Stephen King will want to add it as will fans of any and all horror films and Shout/Scream Factory fans (they are indeed growing). Everyone else might do better to just seek out the original for a more scare filled night.",1433894400,,4705,4.413594470046083
