7424959,5,B014VVNV04,"this show is beautiful. not a ""cooking show"", it has much more to do with what goes into the artistry of food, and the life of a chef than any sort of lame how to thing. Visually it's stunning. It's full of humor, but with an edge. All without being pretentious.
Just watch it. Seriously. You'll like it.",1443484800,4,304,4.258620689655173

7424971,5,B014VVNV04,"Very well done.  Less about the mechanics of recipes and more about the mindset of our finest chefs, as the name suggests. Spectacular photography.",1456704000,,147,5.125

7424974,4,B014VVNV04,"Excellent documentary. I like that Mind of a Chef lets each chef tell their story. These episodes contain much more of a personal take on what the work means to each chef, why they work in the ways that they do. If you love cooking shows, these are great,",1454976000,,255,4.224489795918367

8732033,5,B014VVNV04,"This woman is charming.
I love her stories.
The video is about the stories & then the food.
When she says ""Did you say ""You need a man?"" Nooooo"" during a pasta making scene, I respect her more than any woman ever.
I'm buying the DVD.
Streaming it isn't enough.",1500768000,,260,4.22

8732036,2,B014VVNV04,I enjoyed other seasons much more.  I don't find the food or the host inspiring.  The second episode on garbage was a turn-off and didn't make me want to eat at Prune.,1477526400,,167,4.1875
8732037,2,B014VVNV04,"What a pretentious self centered person. Prune isn't even very good. She's got great contacts, period. Waste of money and time.",1471219200,2,127,5.095238095238095
