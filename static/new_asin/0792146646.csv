7792037,5,0792146646,It's exactly the Trek episode it is supposed to be.  The used VHS is fine; no glitches encountered with it.,1381968000,,107,4.35
7792038,5,0792146646,"I LOVED this episode back when it came out and I still do! Yes, it has cliched slapstack, and yes, it seems unlikely that even if two Klingon scout ships could surprise the Enterprise (ha!), Starfleet's security on ship wouldn't make short work of a dozen Ferengi in a gun (or phaser fight), but still it was a cute one. As a kid (at the time I was about 14 or 15), it's always cool to see kid (well kind of) heroes. It also helped that as a youngster, I thought the young Ro was cute, but that's another story!

Anyway, the way it handles the four characters coming to terms with their situation was spot on. Guinan always was in control, never got upset, and of course, for a married woman like Keiko, there would be....difficulties. Ro and Picard both are having uncomfortable with children, or with their past, so I think the experience helped them grow.

I know some hate this episode for it's fluffiness, but not every show should be the BORG, or something so dark, eh?

Anyway, watch it for yourself-a fine addition to the Star Trek collection! (And remember, the Original Series was a LOT sillier (Spock doing a dance over Kirk's prostrate body for instance))",1285718400,,1167,4.521327014218009
7792039,5,0792146646,"Well, not exactly, but it's great to see Capt. Picard, Ensign Ro (who can be just as grouchy as a kid as an adult), Guinin, and Keiko O'Brian turned into 12 year olds due to a transporter malfunction/magnetic storm (while indeed a TOS regular problem maker, or at least the transporter part, this definitely has a twist unlike other ones).  Well, the Enterprise has to answer a distress call from a planet, so it rushes off to see what the problem is.  Now come the complaints.  First, the relative ease that the B'rel-class Klingon Bird-of-Preys had in beating the Enterprise (I mean, the Enterprise is rated Galaxy-class, which is essentially a dreadnought or battleship.  The B'rel-class is a scout ship!!) I guess the argument could be made that since the Enterprise's shielding was down, they shot the key systems before the Enterprise had a chanced to really beat up the B'rel's.  My other complaint is also obvious.  The relative ease of the Enterprise being completely captured in a matter of like one minute.  (I mean, I would figure it would be standard protocal for security teams to immediately activate the moment they are attacked.)  As far as the Ferengi, it does make sense.  Ferengi marauders don't have cloaks, and these guys are independent anyway.  It probably isn't that hard to get ahold of a couple of older birds of prey with cloaks for a fairly cheap price. Well, all the adults, except Riker (who took command when Picard was juniorized) are transported to the planet to begin mining minerals for their captors.  What's really fun is now Capt. Picard, Guinin, Ro, and Keiko have to figure out a way to defeat the Ferengi pirates.  A fun episode to watch, especially because of the way the ""kids"" have to beat the Ferengi.",1157328000,,1747,4.767441860465116
7792040,5,0792146646,"At the start of Star Trek: The Next Generation it was made clear that Jean-Luc Picard was, to say the least, uncomfortable having to deal with children.  In later seasons he got a lot better at dealing with the wee folk aboard the Enterprise, such as when he was stuck in the turbolift with three children when the ship was hit by quantum filaments in ""Disaster"" (Episode 105).  But for the most part you have to wonder if Picard has simply forgotten what it was like to be a child.  It is this dimension of Picard's character that makes ""Rascals"" such a wonderful episode.
Picard is returning to the Enterprise on a shuttle, along with Guinan, Ensign Ro and Keiko O'Brien.  Suddenly an energy field surrounds the shuttle and when Riker orders an emergency transport the four have been turned into kids.  Riker has to take control of the Enterprise, which heads off to Ligo Seven to answer a distress call.  Then, just to make things interesting, the Enterprise is attacked by a pair of Klingon battle cruisers which turn out to be run by the Ferengi (following all this?).  With their shields down, the Enterprise is taken over by the Ferengi, who beam down all the adults to work the mines on the planet below.  Of course this leaves Picard and the other ""children"" to try to regain control of the ship, with some help from Alexander.
This episode is worth it just to see Jean-Luc throw a tantrum and demand to see his ""father"" Commander Riker.  Picard calls him ""Number One,"" explaining to the Ferengi, ""because he's my Number One Dad.""  The two smile and embrace.  You have to love it.  ""Rascals"" has its moments of cuteness and since we are dealing with the Ferengi the children are never really in danger (not like they are Klingons or the Borg).  This is just a fun episode, so enjoy it and go along for the ride.",984787200,,1820,4.529051987767584
7792041,5,0792146646,"This episode shows that ""bottle"" episodes don't have to be boring.  This light episode's best part is when Picard (now a kid) has to throw a temper tantrum to see Riker (called him 'Dad'). It's one of those  episodes that you can see over and over and it's still funny!",921715200,5,269,4.36
