8622194,4,B00GCVWU6S,"The Malm Opera's 2012 production of Luisa Miller finds an excellent way to make an early Verdi opera a little more visually interesting than this particular work might otherwise be, without having to obscure the original dramatic points in some ill-fitting modernised concept. The costumes remain period and traditional, all the drama is carried out according to the stage directions (there's no anachronistic use modern technology or appliances), but there's a little bit of stylishness applied to the set designs (and perhaps a little symbolism) that works well to give an extra emphasis to the dramatic situation.

Based on 'Kabale und Liebe' by Friedrich von Schiller, the plot of Luisa Miller is a familiar one, or at least familiar in Verdi adaptations of such material. In broad terms it's about fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, it's about family and duty, it's about love and betrayal, freedom and suppression. The plot doesn't really need any extra spelling out, and Verdi's score speaks plainly and eloquently enough for itself, but a little bit of theatrical reinvention can make some of the more melodramatic points sit a little better with a modern-day audience. Rather than merely providing backdrops, the staging at Malm illustrates this situation well with some big gestures, with giant hands gripping the stage, tearing it apart and putting the squeeze on boxed-in rooms.  It's slightly abstract, but it's in keeping with the tone of the work with colours and lighting also playing an important a role in matching the heightened reality of the drama.

The score doesn't perhaps quite have the mastery of characterisation that can be found in subsequent Verdi works, but La Traviata and Rigoletto are clearly just around the corner here. Conducted for Malm Opera by Michael Gttler, the orchestra give Verdi's score a romantic sweep that is in keeping for this work, although I daresay it would be attacked more idiomatically and with a little less delicacy by an Italian orchestra. It sounds wonderful here however, showing the beauty of Verdi's arrangements. Verdi's other great achievement in Luisa Miller is in his writing for the voice and with the right singers in the roles it can be an impressive work.  The cast and chorus at Malm certainly demonstrate its qualities with Luc Robert as the conflicted Rodolfo and Olesya Golovneva as Luisa, but there's good support here also from Vladislav Sulimsky as Miller and Lars Arvidson as Wurm.

Golovneva in particular has the right temperament and timbre for this character. It should not an overpowering soprano voice but that of a delicate woman, initially bright, happy and in love who is gradually broken down by manipulative figures and fear of reprisals. The journey to her death is tricky to navigate, but Golovneva manages to sing the role without the melodramatic mannerisms that you might expect, yet still make her Luisa heartfelt and expressive. It's a style of performance that is perfectly in keeping with the intentions of the production and the staging here at Malm, showing how effectively early-to-mid period Verdi can be treated without revising or reinterpreting the work.

Malm Opera's Luisa Miller is released on Blu-ray and DVD by Arthaus Musik. On Blu-ray, the disc is BD25, all region with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French and Korean. The filming is excellent, using lots of close-ups that show the intensity of the performances, the recording capturing the strong colour schemes that also play a large part in setting the tone of the work.",1405641600,8,3553,5.117241379310345
