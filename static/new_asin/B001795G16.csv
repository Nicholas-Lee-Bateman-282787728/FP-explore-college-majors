3169245,5,B001795G16,"When I first heard about this DVD it was on how much of Jay Cutler lifestyle and behind the scenes footage there is and I wasn't sure if I would be interested.  I am so happy I went ahead and ordered this DVD it has everything trainings at Gold's Venice and Jay's hometown Las Vegas.  It has Jay's lifestyle sections and oh what a life, but Jay is also talking about his views on things.  Then more sections on Jay at other events guest posing and working out on Muscle Beach Venice. One section of Jay at one of his neuromuscular therapy sessions.  As the title says this is Jay from J to Z, it has everything and lots of it.  So glad I purchased it.",1270252800,3,651,4.134920634920635
3169246,4,B001795G16,"This is an interesting movie. To be based on a bodybuilder, there is less emphasis on the bodybuilding, and more on the life of. There is not much said on diet and training (not a bad thing, just stating). You get to see Jay live his life, guest posing, working booths, opening stores, and promoting the sport. I personally wish there would have been more on his training and diet, but I am sure that can be found in some of his other movies (this is the only one i own). This movie is worth the buy though, especially since it is Jays first year as mr olympia.",1252800000,9,561,4.203703703703703

8265421,5,B001795G16,Jay cutler is one of my favorites ever. His DVDs are Awsum wish there were more out there. A pleasure to watch and will learn believe me,1426550400,,136,4.074074074074074
8265422,5,B001795G16,Lets us in on what its like to be with Jay including his dogs. Lots of good information as well.,1414800000,,96,3.85
8265423,5,B001795G16,Great DVD. Really shows Jays life in and out of the gym. I recommend it for any fan of not jus jay but bodybuilding.,1371686400,,116,3.875
8265424,5,B001795G16,"Pretty cool DVD, shows you the true side of Jay Cutler - and I must say, appears to be a pretty cool guy. Everything from his training, to massage therapy sessions, to home and hangout sessions is in here. Definitely don't want to miss this one!",1354492800,2,245,4.3478260869565215
8265425,4,B001795G16,"A fantastic oppertunity to experience the life of a great bodybuilder. This DVD takes you all over. Enjoy a tale of Jays life as he gives a seminar, learn his way of working out and the tips he gives while watching numerous full workouts. Be prepared to be jealous as he gives you a guided tour of his palatial house with all his toys and be greated by his nutty dogs. Find out how and what he likes to eat. All in all a great way to spend your money. I can only hope there will be another 6 hour in depth video like this sometime soon as Jay hits his 40s and prepares for his comeback.",1347667200,,586,4.017094017094017
8265426,5,B001795G16,THIS DVD WAS NEW STILL IN PACKAGE..THE SELLER WAS QUICK ON DELIVERY... THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT SO IT HAS NOT BEEN OPENED TO WATCH PICTURE YET..,1323734400,,144,4.37037037037037
8265427,5,B001795G16,"Of all Jay Cutlers DVD's this is my favorite (One Step Closer DVD is a close second). You'll see Jay's complete workout routine for every bodypart (including back training at Muscle Beach), guest poses, neuromuscular therapy, his meals, the opening of his MaxMuscle store, his speach at the fit expo, plus a Cribs style extra where Jay takes you on a tour of his house. Look for a lot of familar faces too like Lou Ferrigno, WWF TripleH, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Jay Cutler: From Jay to Z has everything you would want in a bodybuilding dvd....complete workouts (Jay even gives some tips), what he eats on a daily basis, and the lifestyle part of being Mr. Olympia. It's a 2 disc set 6hrs 43min plus 35min Cribs & Extras.",1318118400,2,723,4.612403100775194
8265428,5,B001795G16,"Dude... what more needs to be said than it is Jay Cutler! This was a great series. I watched some reviews and clips and was sold. It sounded like it is one of his better series. I really enjoy getting to see his home life and his meals and the more human side of Jay because it gave me a sense of camaraderie with him because I love lifting weights. Although I have learned one of his bad habits from watching the dvd and that is throwing the weights. I was working out in Golds and threw the 130lb dumbbells down and one of the 10lb plates came flying off and then rolled away. Funny because I was standing right in front of the sign that says not to drop the weights. I shrugged it off and blame the gym for old equipment and tucked it away. Back to the disks though. They are impressive workouts not to short and not so long that I can't watch one before a workout to get myself jazzed up and mentally in the game.

This is a must have if you like Jay Cutler and for anyone really wanting a closer look at a professional not just in bodybuilding but in everything the man does. Other than obvious use of steroids he is a mentor for success, and has the same kind of drive that Arnold did.",1315526400,,1191,4.089743589743589
