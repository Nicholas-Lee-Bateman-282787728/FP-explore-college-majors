8482573,5,B005PQ5WIE,I've been training in hapkido for about 5 years now at several different schools learning several different styles. I also have a nice hapkido dvd collection. This has some of the best joint lock flowing instructions of any of the DVDs out there. I've watched some of the competitors. I learned new techniques and variations to a lot of what I already know..,1500163200,,358,4.698412698412699
8482574,5,B005PQ5WIE,"The final dvd in the series ...how to go from one technique to another if one doesn't work...this is the glue that holds it all together. My experience working as a prison officer is that every technique doesn't work every time, as people have different pain thresholds, different body types, some are high on drugs or alcohol and when this happens you need to be able to transition to another lock or technique...the beauty of these drills are that they flow into one another and adapt to what is presented rather than waiting for an assailant to attack in a certain way. Another first class instructional dvd by Alain Burrese",1445299200,,627,4.709090909090909
8482575,1,B005PQ5WIE,Only work if you're VERY strong and the person isn't RESISTING.  WORST martial arts instructional ever!!!! Don't waste your time or money on this,1444262400,,145,5.041666666666667
8482576,5,B005PQ5WIE,"I'm primarily a Tae Kwon Do practioner but I've always been fascinated by Aikido ever since the I saw Steven Seagal break arms for the first time as a kid.  I found some great instructional videos on youtube for Aikido and me and a friend of mine started going through them together.  Something was missing though... while Aikido offers great insight into body movement and a harmonizing philosophy I felt like that philosophy was holding me back somewhat from really getting the most out of these movements.  When I saw the trailer for this Volume 5, I was knew it was the missing piece for me and promptly ordered it.  I was not disappointed!  Alain is a practitioner of the Korean art of Hapkido.  Hapkido and Aikido share the same lineage coming down from Aiki Ju Jutsu.  The differences are that Hapkido doesn't tend to be quite as circular in motion but more importantly they encourage learning the locks from an initiating attack standpoint and not just ""from a wrist grab"" or ""punch"" defenses.  On top of that, Alain's breakdown and flows from one technique to the other really allow the practitioner to ""flow like water""... it creates a deeper understanding of the anatomical structure and limitation of our limbs and how to transition from one lock to the next, should the one fail.  Sometimes a guy is almost in an armbar but is very strong and will bend out of it.  After watching this, you don't panic in that situation, you just say ""thank you!"" and shift your body the other way and take the opponent to the ground with a twisting wrist lock.  Buy this DVD, and find someone you can trust and practice with and really explore these flow drills.  It is so worth the investment in time!",1388102400,,1699,4.607973421926911

Volume 5: Combining Locks and Lock Flow Drills

In Volume 5 of the Lock-On series Alain expands upon material previously demonstrated in the Lock-On series Volumes 1-4 -- finger locks, wrist locks, elbow locks and shoulder locks. This volume ties it all together through his use of the concept of Flow Drills. With my limited Martial Arts training and experience, the ideology and use of Flow Drills as a training regimen is new to me. Flow Drills are designed to ingrain the techniques demonstrated, and to train the mind and body to transition from one technique to another - seamlessly as well as effortlessly. The flows teach you to look for transitions based on your current circumstances or needs, but they also teach you to look for the flaws, and to look for the principles employed and what makes them work.

All of the information shown in this set can be useful in the context of a negative social encounter. The ideas here would be useful for some of those self-defense scenarios. I find that the information here is going to be of use to Security, Bouncers, and anyone that needs to safely deal with an aggressive opponent, in a safe manner, which could also be those in Law Enforcement.

Alain does a good job of explaining some key principles throughout this volume as well -- weight distribution, anchoring or basing as it's been described, proper grip -- but also surprise, speed and the need for PRACTICE!

At 21:00 into the DVD, Alain starts to demonstrate combinations - using two techniques chained together in sequence. He goes through Finger Locks to Shoulder Locks, Wrist Locks to Elbow Locks, a lock called the 'V' Lock, the use of the Standing Center Lock, and the Chicken Wing Lock. These are all demonstrated as responses to some common grabs -- cross-arm, same side, etc.. Alain also demonstarates an 'S' Lock, something I learned during my brief training in Aikido. Another important concept here is the takedown and finishing moves -- proning out an aggressive person to gain control for possible cuffing techniques, or even to transition back into an exit escort technique after verbal comands have been given and the aggressor starts to comply again.

At 40:00 into the DVD, Alain gets into more complex chains of techniques - 3 and 4 techniques strung together as transitions. This is where he also starts to demonstrate the ability to initiate contact rather than being in a self-defense mode. The techniques don't always have to be done from a strictly defensive mode, but could be implemented from an offensive mode as well, meaning that YOU are intitiating the technique without waiting for a trigger-event. Initiating would usually be done by those aforementioned individuals in Security or Law Enforcement that have a responsibility to take action when the situation deems it necessary to do so.

At 57:00, Alain ventures into a few very complex drills - chains of 10 or more techniques - these I believe will just enhance your ability to transition in smaller chains, to enhance the overall educational value of your previous training.

The DVD ends with some PREVIEWS - something I'm definitely looking forward to as well. Alain explains that this series is meant to be a series of add-on techniques that can be used with any other Martial Art, which I totally agree with.

There are of course many things that need to be considered, and Alain summarizes some of those here - using other skills along with these techniques - that could be strikes, kicks, throws, and maybe use of weapons. He talks about Use of Force, which is something that every Martial Artist needs to learn, understand, and follow.

For my own needs, this series has been a very good find -- it has given me many  techniques that I could use to deal with less-than-pleasant situations that my job requires me to deal with. In watching this DVD alone, for the third time tonight, I learned a few things that I had missed in previous viewings. I also learned that I am learning -- seeing things differently than I had previously. Alain is very good at explaining all of the techniques in this series.

You can learn from a DVD and from books -- but training it is essential. Alain makes the learning part easy, and straightforward.",1363305600,2,4292,4.825850340136054
8482578,5,B005PQ5WIE,"The ""Lock On"" series represents probably the only truly ""educational"" set of videos available for Hapkido. Master Burrese has a real talent for explaining a technique as he demonstrates it. He covers the underlying principles, key ideas on making it work, ideas for finishes and variations, and a wide array of responses for the various ""what if"" scenarios. His application is always crisp, precise, and fluid and his partner reacts realistic (and safely). Students who watch these videos and work the techniques with a partner, hopefully under the auspices of a trained instructor, should be able to learn from this presentation.

Students should learn Hapkido from trained instructors in person. The material on these videos would serve as excellent supplemental material for all Hapkido students but really serve as excellent examples of an area that is poorly represented - advanced level material to assist instructors. The material on ""Lock On volumes 1-5"" would be best used as additional resources for instructors. They are clear, well filmed (with various camera angles), well described, and cover the basic elements of the art.

This volume represents a step into the next level of study. The first 4 volumes provide in depth exploration of joint locks, organized by volume by the area they affect (e.g. shoulder locks, etc.). This fifth volume takes it to the next level - flowing from one technique to another.

The video begins and ends with a short introduction and conclusion, each with an overview of the volume and key considerations to keep in mind. The next 20 minutes revolves around the ""Four Corner Throw"" (called `shihonage' in Japanese arts). Master Burrese shows the technique in depth, with consideration for maintaining control and for either ramping up or softening the power used. The technique is shown from same and cross side wrist garbs, punches, the clinch, and from a first strike/initiative (seon-soo) manner. In most cases, he drops to one knee, but he shows ways to perform it while remaining standing. This 20 minute clinic on the ""Four Corner Throw"" is worth the price of the video alone.

From there, the volume shifts into a section showing how to transition from one lock to another. The reasoning is sound - sometimes a lock doesn't work and you need to switch to a different one. Or, it also serves as a great way to practice locks with a partner in a quick way (great during class for experienced students). This section details 14 combinations, ranging from stringing 2 or 3 locks together to 3 or 4 steps to a finale with 11 parts. This runs for about 40 minutes.

After the conclusion, there are two more sections, each a  5 minute preview on upcoming videos from Master Burrese -  ""Restraint and Control"" and ""Chokes and Sleepers"" (with dan bong , cane, and unbreakable umbrella included).

Again, the entire ""Lock On"" set gets my highest recommendation. Not only does it represent the best ""educational"" type of video available (as opposed to a ""technique catalog"" which may only be relevant to a single kwan or federation), but it also represents some of the only video material out there geared to provide information for instructors and advanced level practitioners.",1342569600,2,3220,5.005607476635514
8482579,5,B005PQ5WIE,"This video shows a vital aspect of martial arts- flowing from one technique to another. Practicing these moves until you are fluid will put you in a much better position should you have to restrain someone. As with other joint lock and pain compliance moves, there are often counters that an angry aggressor might escape your restraint. So learning to flow to other restraints can mean all the difference. This video does an excellent job of stringing moves together that were explained in the first four videos. Any martial art practitioner who has done these locks/restraints before will find this video very helpful. The moves are explained as they are done slow a few times so you can see them, then full speed. Also variations are provided.",1334966400,,745,4.874015748031496
