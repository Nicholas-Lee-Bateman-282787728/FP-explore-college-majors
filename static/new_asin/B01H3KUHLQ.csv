Found out.the special ""Highlights of a Quarter Century of Bob hope on Television"" is edited as well. Missing Streisand too.",1475193600,14,313,5.019230769230769
7776390,4,B01H3KUHLQ,"The Bob Hope Specials: Thanks for the Memories"" is a collection of comedy-variety specials the entertainer did for NBC-TV. Beginning in 1950 and spanning five decades, the specials spanned ten presidential administrations from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton. His star-filled USO Christmas shows were performed to servicemen around the world.

Hope had an extensive career on radio, in movies, and on television. Noted for his comedy timing and specializing in one-liners and fast-paced delivery of jokes, he would often direct the gags at himself, first building himself up and then tearing himself down. He is one of the first comedians to use cue cards.

This 6-DVD set contains 13 specials from Hopes career featuring dozens of celebrity guests. Highlights include Hopes first comedy special in living color with guests Jack Benny, Bing Crosby and Janet Leigh; The Bob Hope Chevy Show, with the complete cast of I Love Lucy plus James Cagney; and a spoof of Star Wars and other sketches with Tony Bennett, Perry Como, James Garner, Mark Hamill, Dean Martin, Olivia Newton-John, Barbra Streisand, Tuesday Weld and The Muppets.

 In addition, theres a murder mystery parody with Charo, Milton Berle, Don Rickles, George Gobel, Alan King, Don Knotts, Groucho Marx and Vincent Price; Hopes 1967 USO tour to 22 bases around Vietnam, Thailand, and the South Pacific with gust star Raquel Welch; and a look at Hopes personal relationships with American presidents including Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy, and Harry S. Truman.

Also included is a collection of bloopers from 30 years of Hopes shows with George Burns, Sammy Davis, Jr., Angie Dickinson, Phyllis Diller, Burt Reynolds, Don Rickles, Brooke Shields, Elizabeth Taylor, Mr. T, John Wayne, and many others.",1474243200,12,1786,5.252631578947368
