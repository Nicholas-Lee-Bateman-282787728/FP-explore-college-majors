1884913,5,B00009MEKH,"After a disappointing follow up to ""Jonah"" in ""Auto-namation"", Big Idea has come back strong with ""Ballad""! This would have been the perfect follow up to ""Jonah"", with several cameos from that movie sprinkled here and there (look for Mister Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls and a great cameo from Kahleel...who would have thought a caterpillar could rap?). It had some truly hilarious moments, but the highlight of the dvd has to be ""Bellybutton"", featuring Larry, Mister Lundt, and the gang in a music video to rival anything N'Sync ever put out (though I doubt they ever sang of the same subject matter). The message from God's Word is clear in Little Joe, and I have to say I'm really glad I took the time to get this one. I wish it had been a little longer, but that's just because I was having such a good time. My kids loved it, but I think my wife and I had a better time than they did. Great work, Big Idea!",1060128000,5,912,4.402366863905326
1884914,5,B00009MEKH,"I really love this show! BigIdea has creaded another splindid
show for kids to watch. With songs, joks and a great message that
teaches kids a lesson in facing hardship. I loved the sillysong

get a lot from this show. I think everyone shoud buy it!",1060041600,,312,4.491228070175438

1884937,5,B00009MEKH,"Classic Veggie Tales - Wonderful way of illustrating moral lessons for young children from a Christian perspective with vegetables (cucumbers, tomatoes, peas, etc.) in starring roles. The tales are spun to be entertaining to children and adults alike.",1386547200,,251,5.631578947368421
1884938,5,B00009MEKH,"I have to admit, I bought this for my kids but I ended up loving it myself. It's a great story and very easy for the kids to understand. It also has little references to other movies that parents should be able to catch up on. Very well done!",1382659200,,242,3.9591836734693877
1884939,5,B00009MEKH,"We love the veggie tales - Bible stories contextualized for little ones and humorous for parents.  This tells the story of Joseph, sold by his jealous brothers, falsely accused in Potipher's service, forgotten in jail, continuing to trust God, and ultimately forgiving his brothers and being reunited with his family.  And of course, the belly button song!  :)",1379462400,,360,5.172413793103448
1884940,4,B00009MEKH,"This was a good and wholesome show to teach children bible stories in a stylized way.  It is also still comical for adults through the use of references, such as one part that references the Beatles song ""Hey Jude"".",1375574400,,215,4.512820512820513

1884943,5,B00009MEKH,"I teach Sunday School @my local church & this DVD has so many lessons which can be spun off it - not just the whole Joesph story of perseverance & faith in God etc - but also great lesson on forgiveness / kindness etc. Great, great teaching resource. I'd highly recommend this DVD - I'm teaching ""tween"" boyz - so even at a higher age level - they still watch this DVD with intent & I know they love getting the messages within the DVD - heck - just last Sunday - one of my students told me afterwards - ""I've seen this DVD three times now & every-time I watch it - I pickup another line which reminds me just how my Jesus loves me !!!"" - that alone is worth purchasing this DVD for.",1369958400,,683,4.029411764705882

1884955,5,B00009MEKH,How could you go wrong with this DVD; it is inventive and so likable.  My grandson absolutely loves it!  Do not hesitate to buy one like this.  My husband and I are still humming the tune from it.,1368748800,,196,4.105263157894737
1884956,4,B00009MEKH,"Good quality DVD, though would have appreciated info re region [seems ok for USA, but not Europe - unless have cheapo machine that plays all regions!]. Content very good - though if checked with Bible, not accurate re which of Pharaoh's servants were spared. Delivery prompt & product in new condition.",1352505600,,302,4.9411764705882355
1884957,5,B00009MEKH,Love this DVD. It's lots of fun for the entire family from gradma to the 2 yrs. old. It makes it easier for kids to understand and gives parents good ideas for furthering the story and those that follow in the Bible.,1324944000,,216,4.166666666666667

1884960,5,B00009MEKH,"I had previously purchased Moe and the Big Exit, which turned out to be the sequel of The Ballad of Little Joe. My 4 year old loves the ballad of little joe and he can't stop singing the songs. It's one of the best purchases I've made this year.!  Excellent lessons that's very easy for little ones to understand. Thank you Big Idea for Veggie Tales....",1239580800,,353,4.348484848484849
1884961,5,B00009MEKH,"This ""western"" version of the story of Joseph (the one with the coat and the jealous brothers) is done so well with typical VeggieTales humor and warmth. It tackles the difficult concept of why bad things happen even though God loves us. The silly songs episode - No Bellybutton - is also one of my personal favorites.",1232323200,,318,4.5964912280701755

1884976,4,B00009MEKH,"I saw this video while I was staying at the home of some Christian friends. Like all veggie tales stories they give a Christian message to children in a fun and non-over bearing fashion. Like all of the other veggietales videos they feature computer animated vegetables as actors.

The ballad of little joe tells the story of Joseph the youngest son of Jacob/Israel. It set as a modern western. The story takes place in Dodgeball City where the patrons contantly have to look out for randomly flying dogeballs.

As I mentioned before the story follows the Genesis account of Joseph as modern western. I like the one line where Little Joe is kidnapped by a band of desperados and he says ""deperados you better come to your senses!"". This was a reference to the Eagles classic ""Desperado.""

The belly button song is a classic.",1117670400,,824,4.708333333333333
1884977,5,B00009MEKH,This is definitely our favorite veggie tales - and we ALL sing the belly button song. Definitely worth the money and a good intro for new veggie fans (play the DVD with subtitles for new viewers so they can catch all the hilarious lines).,1101945600,,238,4.431818181818182
1884978,5,B00009MEKH,"We are huge Veggie Tales fans, my 2 year old daughter and I, and this is our favorite VT video yet.  All of our friends who have stepped foot into our house have been asked, no, told to sit down and watch the Belly Button song.  They have all laughed out loud.  This will definitely be the Christmas gift that we pass out this year.",1091145600,,332,4.076923076923077
1884979,5,B00009MEKH,"I have two daughters ages, 20 months and 3 1/2.  They both loved this movie.  My youngest refers to Larry as Joe due to this movie.  The story is fun, fast paced, and entertaining to people of all ages.  I find taking a Bible story and applying it to another age and time helps children be able to apply the scriptures to themselves and to their situations today.  My oldest will talk about how bad things can happen and God still loves us after we watch this film.  (My daughters like it so much that sometimes this seems like it is too often)",1081036800,,544,4.233009708737864
1884980,5,B00009MEKH,"We're HUGE veggietales fans, so I had to add this one to our collection.  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, I was impressed with their presentation, even better than I had expected.
And Boyz in the Sink are great!",1075593600,2,220,4.475
1884981,5,B00009MEKH,"This is a cute video.  Taking the Biblical story of Jonah to a western type theme was a good idea, and creative.  Little things like that are the details that draw in the adults to watching these videos -- even if you already know the Biblical story of Joseph.  There is curiosity about how it will be presented in this format.
The silly song has to be one of their best.  I wish I could remember exactly how the song goes, but one of the gourds confesses his secret about himself that worries him.  He actually has no belly button!  How could this be?  He goes to the doctor to see what can be done about this situation.  The doctor, played by the worm in the Jonah video, comes in and tells him that it is quite normal for gourds not to have belly buttons.  If he would like, he can get a prosthetic belly button, which would be covered ""by your shirt but not your HMO.""
The boundless creativity Big Idea Productions puts into these videos never ceases to amaze me.  I'm looking forward to more in the future.  I suspect that I'll want to see subsequent VeggieTales videos as long as they come out, whether I have children of viewing age any longer or not.
Obviously, in case you couldn't tell, I highly recommend this video.  It is great, wholesome, family entertainment.",1074556800,2,1274,4.397435897435898
1884982,5,B00009MEKH,"Not much Veggie animation has happened since Lyle the Kindly Viking due to ""Jonah: A Veggietales Movie"" being produced.  My children were loving the previous videos, but this one has been their favorite ever since it came out!!!  My one year old will come up to me and ask for ""Little Joe"" to be played.
The animation in this feature is top-notch, and Big Idea uses plenty of fun songs to keep the children hooked.  This ""Western Bible Story"" also comes with a good moral point for those older children who do watch it.  Two thumbs up!",1073088000,3,535,4.484536082474227
1884983,5,B00009MEKH,"I love veggie tales but some of their movies in the last year have disappointed me--so much so that I almost didn't buy this DVD.  I am so glad that I did though.  The music is great, the story is funny and entertaining and stays close to the bible story that it is written from.  I love this movie and so do my 7 and 3 year olds.  And of course, the silly song is back and better than ever!",1072396800,,391,3.85
1884993,5,B00009MEKH,"THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JOE is the Veggie Tale version of the Biblical story of Joseph. Bob and Larry try to explain why so many bad things happen to good people. Bob wants a straight Bible story and Larry wants a western. They compromise and THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JOE is the result. The film contains all the great humor and heart that have made Veggie Tales so special and popular. This episode includes the Silly Song of ""Belly Button"" sung by the In the Sink Boys. The song is hilarious and reminds one of the famous ""Hamburger"" song from a few years ago. Perhaps Mr. Lunt should sing more love longs. This is a great Veggie Tale episode and the DVD is a welcome addition for any collection. Kids love the Veggie Tales and so do adults. The episodes are made for kids, but adults will perhaps enjoy them even more.  The DVD includes a commetary, several previews, a few games, and a few other bonus items.",1068508800,14,905,4.386904761904762
1884994,5,B00009MEKH,"While I was a little disapointed with ""Autotainment"" ""The Ballad"" restores all confidence in VeggieTales.  A wonderful tale that shines the light on ""why bad things happen to good people"" in simple language that children of all ages can grasp with being engaging enough for adults.  The animation in this one is phenominal!  And ""Belly Button"" should be the new top Silly Song of all time.  And the best part was not having to skip through any commercials that proceed the majority of children's films.  Pure family fun.",1065571200,3,520,4.863636363636363
1884995,2,B00009MEKH,"This was ok, but I didn't like it as much as the rest of the Veggie Tales shows.",1065484800,,80,3.5
1884996,5,B00009MEKH,"Funnier than ""Dave and the Giant Pickle""'s sheep who fall over ""a lot"".  We are in love with the French Peas.  The western story was terrific.  The kids loved it.  As for the silly song - my hubby and I had to watch it again after the kids went to bed.  Nearly killed ourselves with laughter.  We just rented it and now I HAVE to HAVE it.  Stocking stuffer!!!",1064880000,,359,4.115942028985507
1884997,5,B00009MEKH,"...I don't got a belly button.
<<< bel - lee but -tin >>>
This tale of Joseph and the coat of many colors is funny,
clever, easily accessible to children (and adults!).  A noteworthy effort to remind us that God has a will for all of us.  Not unike ""Josh and the Big Wall"" in which we are instructed to follow God's plan, not ours.  Veggie fans are going to LOVE this one.
I can't seem to get the song ""Belly Button"" out of my head. It's a hilarious parody of 98 degrees, N-Sync, or whatever generic boy band is remotely popular right now.
Never thought I'd see Lance Bass portrayed as a squash.
Get this video/DVD now, and share it with your friends.  All of them.",1062806400,,665,4.21259842519685
1884998,5,B00009MEKH,Another classic from Veggie Tales.  My son loves the cowboy theme and as he gets older the Christian theme will sink in!!  I emjoy the jokes and the superb animation,1062288000,,165,4.466666666666667
1884999,5,B00009MEKH,"I got this recently for my 2 kids (2 and 4) and its great fun. I can't get the song by boys in the sink ""I got to tell you something"" out of my mind. It's a fantastic retelling of the story of Joseph in western time. The DVD has a 321 penguines short on it. Its the same one on the ""Plante tell a lie"" movie though but my kids don't seem to mind watching it on either video, there also is a fun multiple choice game at the end (but a non reader can't do it on his own)
Keep up the good work Big Ideas.",1060560000,4,501,3.6481481481481484
1885000,5,B00009MEKH,"Little Joe (Larry the Cucumber), is his father's favorite son.  When his brothers (the French peas) sell him into slavery in Dodge Ball City, he goes to work for McPotiphar.  But just when he's made employee of the month, Miss Kitty (Madame Blueberry) frames him for stealing.  Is God really still with him?  What could God's plan possibly be?
Of course, anyone familiar with the Bible will recognize this as the story of Joseph from the Old Testament.  Told in a completely fresh way, the theme of God working all things for good for those who follow Him comes through as loud and clear as it does in the original.  Of course, the guys at Big Idea have had their own fun with it along the way, and the result is another episode filled with humor for the entire family.  We even go back to the kitchen sink and get to see Cordy the Computer again.
A special mention must be made of the new silly song.  ""Belly Button,"" as sung by boy band ""Boyz in the Sink"" is one of the best they've come up with in a while.  I dare you not to laugh (and have it stuck in your head for the next few days.)
Big Idea continues to fill their DVD releases with fun bonus activities for the kids and interesting behind the scenes stuff for adults.  There's nothing unusual here if you've seen their other releases, but that's not a bad thing by any stretch.
This DVD is a return to the fun of some of the earlier Bible stories done Veggie style.  I enjoyed every minute of it and bet any Veggie fan will, too.",1060128000,27,1489,4.263345195729538
