7957263,5,B00005YUSC,I believed we were missing one of the disks but found it under and covered by the instructions. Bill of Rights Press contacted me quickly and was going to send the disk. Very good custom service on their part. Viewed the 2nd disk and was good stuff.,1325980800,2,249,4.319148936170213
7957264,5,B00005YUSC,"This very affordable 2 DVDR self-defense package was released in 2002 by Paladin Press and Alain Burrese (pronounced: Alan Burr-ee-se.) At that time Alain had been a Martial Artist for 18 years. Korean Hapkido, a Martial Art with emphasis on Self-Defense, is what Alain references for this set.

Alain served in the U.S. Military, and has performed security and bodyguard work since leaving the military. Besides producing several videos, he is also an author, and e-book author. Alain authored the hard-to-find book Hard Won Wisdom, and recently an e-book or [..] traditional print [..] series called Tough Guy Wisdom. He also produced the videos Hapkido Hoshinsul, Hapkido Cane and the Lock On Joint Locking Essentials series.

This set was designed for the person that doesn't want to study a Martial Art for years. Period. Alain distills his Hapkido art down to the essentials necessary to help you learn self-defense for use on the street, and it will also will help the dedicated Martial Artist cross-over to learn real Self-Defense versus what he or she may practice in the dojo.

Alain has done a great job of presenting a lot of material that is easily learned, easy to understand, and likely to save your bacon when the heat gets turned up.

DVD1:

 In Chapter ONE Alain introduces a very important principle that is your best defense against in any situation - awareness. We are all way too caught up in our cell phones and other personal electronic devices and we tend to lose track of what else is going on all around us. That leaves us vulnerable to attack. The first thing you'll learn here is to become more aware of what's going on around you, at all times. Failing to do so will present someone else with the opportunity to relieve you of your belongings, simple as that.

 Chapter TWO teaches you proper stance and footwork. Alain explains stance and how to move your feet to maintain balance and proper positioning. The moves and principles are again easily acquired. Alain goes on to demonstrate some simple scenarios of how to implement these movements in relation to facing a potential aggressor.

 In Chapter THREE is Alain describes over a dozen strikes that can be used on the upper-body of an aggressor. Alain demonstrates a strike and then an upper-body target and explains why the particular strike/target will work.

 Chapter FOUR is about lower-body strikes/targets. Again, Alain presents suitable strikes and targets.

DVD 2:

 This dvd starts with some common grabs and chokes that you may fall victim to. These techniques may also be used against larger and/or stronger aggressors, which makes them very useful.

 Chapter TWO is dedicated to break-falls - learning how to fall properly, and safely. Alain demonstrates a few ways to ease yourself into these techniques. Learning how to fall and recover will be very important in your overall study.

 In Chapter THREE is a brief study about being or ending up on the ground, while being attacked by an aggressor. You don't want to end up there! Alain shows you a few very effective strikes that will fend off an attacker and perhaps present you with the opportunity to regain your feet.

 Chapter FOUR ties it all together. Alain demonstrates a few combinations and encourages you to create and practice your own. All attacks are different, and how you choose to defend against them will never be the same twice. In some other systems, these are known as flow-drills.

This is a great DVD set that will help most anyone - students, martial artists, security personnel, healthcare professionals, and anyone that wants to have more confidence when facing a threat. Alain's style is very easy to watch and learn from, the audio and video are topnotch, and there's a lot of great material here. Being a healthcare professional I found many techniques that I will recommend that our institution consider in our training regimen. Do yourself a favor and buy this very affordable set - you're sure to learn something new, useful, and most of all - effective!",1325376000,8,4034,4.8928046989721
7957265,5,B00005YUSC,"I just watched Alain Burrese's STREETFIGHTING ESSENTIALS - Combining Western Boxing and Hapkido into an Unstoppable Self-Defense System 2-DVD set and was very impressed at what I saw.

In his introduction, Mr Burrese explains that this set is for a basic set of essential techniques for self defense. He offers some good basic striking (hands and feet) combined with the goal to ""streamline Hapkido into the bare essentials for the street, crossing the line into 'real' self defense."" The hallmark of all of Mr Burrese's DVDs is thoroughness and systematic development of the material, and this set hold true to that as well.

As it stands, this set would be an ideal base to create a self defense core system ""add-on"" to another art (like Taekwondo or etc). There is a lot of room here to modify, adapt and fit it into what you do.

Students who want ""more"" could look to flesh this out in several ways, either through cross training or other sources. To be honest, this reminds me a lot of the basic few levels of ""Combat Hapkido"", with much of the same attitude, ideas, philosophy, and even techniques. Interested students who like this set would probably be happy to build further on it through Combat Hapkido (ICHF). Alternatively, students who wanted the more traditional side would find this a decent introduction to Traditional Hapkido as well (especially if they looked at Mr Burrese's other DVD offerings).

The set is made up of two disks, for a total of about 2 and a half hours of material. Each section is very thorough with a wide range of demonstrations, tips on performance and targets, and everything is tied together well. There are nice review sections at the end of each section which show all of the techniques in short order.

Interspaced throughout the disks are self defense scenarios showing Alain (and others) defending against attackers in realistic settings. The normal clothes and outdoor settings add a hint of realism and the responses are very well put together, very realistic.

The details:

Disk 1
Introduction - including a great bit on awareness and avoidance.
The first 20 minutes covers a neutral stance, basic footwork/movement, positioning, blocks and slipping attacks. At the end of this section, there is a quick and easy review of the material covered. (This type of review follows each section and was very useful)

The next 36 minutes covered upper body strikes, ranging from basic jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts to hammerfists, and knifehands to palm strikes, forearm strikes and elbows. All are demonstrated with careful attention to footwork, power generation, targeting and practicality.

The last 25 minutes of this disk covers a range of lower body strikes ranging from basic kicks (front, side, roundhouse) to practical ones like stomps, scoop kicks, and knees. There is also a short section on head butts and biting(!). Again, everything is demonstrated with careful attention to footwork, power generation, targeting and practicality.

Disk 2
The first 35 minutes of this disk shows breakaways, escapes, throws, and other ways to deal with a variety of attacks ranging from wrist grabs, sleev grabs, chokes, and lapel grabs to bearhugs, headlocks, nelsons and so on. Although there is only 1 or 2 technqiues shown for each category, it should be noted that all of the various techniques can be cross-applied to the other categories, making for a wide range of effective responses.

Jointlocks are not covered and he makes a reference that they are covered in a separate volume (although I would be more included to invest in Mr. Burrese's upcoming 5-volume set of Lock On joint lock instructional DVDs - excellent stuff.)

The next 20 minutes covers basic breakfalls and covers them well. I particularly enjoyed this section as it reminded me of almost exactly the same way I learned them in Korea. The next 10 minutes applies those falls in teaching sweeps, throws and takedowns.

The next section was the only disappointing section for me. The ""Fighting on the Ground"" section was only 7 minutes long and covered a ideas on getting back up, kicking from the ground and escaping from a simple mount. The main idea was to avoid going to the ground, which I agree with but would have liked to have seen some more in depth takedown defenses (especially against someone with half-decent takedown skills) and a few more technqiues to deal with being on the ground, e.g. escaping a guard or mount and getting back to your feet (or finishing on the ground). This section is the only part I wasn't completely satisfied with, but this is an area where you can get some supplemental material for to round out the system.

The final 8 minutes wraps up with a ideas on how to ""combine the tools"", showing some excellent combinations and scenarios. His basic principle is to finsh quickly and get out of there. He reiterates that this ""doesn't cover everything - it's just a core of essential techniques.""

All in all, this is an excellent resource with a lot of great ideas and material to consider. Traditional HKD students may not see a lot of ""new material"" in it but may enjoy some of the different striking involved as well the tips and ideas on applying/combining material for street self defense. For Combat Hapkido students, the same holds true although most of the physical material would have been covered by Green or Purple Belt in the ICHF curriculum.",1187740800,23,5413,4.9070021881838075
7957266,5,B00005YUSC,"I cannot give this Video enough praise. Mr Burrese has worked very hard and given any person(s) getting this a lot to learn and work on, this is the stuff that is very hard to learn in most schools, Tape is well done and very well put togeather. It show just what you need without any bull and my highest regards for both Mr Burrese and the production team.

7957267,5,B00005YUSC,"In the two-tape set, Streetfighting Essentials: Combining Western Boxing and Hapkido into an Unstoppable Self-defense System, veteran martial arts trainer Alain Burrese teaches you basic hand strikes, footwork, low-line kicks, escapes from chokes, grabs, bear-hugs, and other essentials to help you come out on top of the most violent confrontations, so that you end your shift just as healthy and pretty as you began.
Alain draws on his extensive background in judo and Hapkido, as well as his in-the-trenches experience in the military and working as a bodyguard and bouncer in some of the toughest locations around the world. He packages his knowledge in an organized presentation that benefits the novice as well as the seasoned fighter.
In Tape One, Alain shows the precise way to stand, move, block, and execute the classic jab, cross, hook and uppercut, all combined with well-balanced footwork. After he demonstrates the best target for each punch, he introduces the palm-heel strike to use with the aforementioned punches, which is a better choice for officers so as to prevent injury to their gun hands. He goes on to teach several other hand strikes -- including some designed to stop an assailant but not seriously hurt him - and a half dozen simple kicks.  .
Alain doesn't waste time and videotape with fancy smancy techniques that have little or no street application. Probably because of his background of fighting for real, he sticks to solid basics, the precise techniques needed by street officers when wristlocks are not enough. Realistic street attack scenarios are interspersed throughout the lessons to show how the presented material works in the mean streets.
In Tape Two, Alain teaches how to escape from a large variety of common grabs and holds, information rare to find in any police academy. There is a section on how to fall properly, and another section that teaches you how to execute a few basic throws, drags, head twists, and pull-downs. Even if you are well versed in self-defense, there will be something for you in these videos.
Streetfighting Essentials: Combining Western Boxing and Hapkido into an Unstoppable Self-defense System is designed for, as Alain says, ""the person who does not want to study martial arts for years...and to help the martial artist who wants to cross the boundary into real self defense situations.""
Does he accomplish his objective? Yes, he does, and the excellent camera work and interspersed, realistic scenarios all add up to a high quality tape set applicable to the needs of law enforcement.",1022198400,12,2563,5.102380952380952
7957268,5,B00005YUSC,"Alain Burrese has added yet another excellent video to his first tape, Hapkido Hoshinsul: The Explosive Korean Art of Self Defense, which allowed the beginner and the advanced student to both learn.  In that tape he presented the basics of selected Hapkido joint locks applied in a variety of situations so that the novice could appreciate the way basics may be strung together. The advanced student could refresh and test his/her understanding of how techniques relate to each other without just going down the checklist of techniques required for each rank. This two tape set of videos entitled Streetfighting Essentials: Combining Western Boxing and Hapkido into an Unstoppable Self-defense System is 165 minutes of clear demonstrations and explanations of basic strikes, footwork, low line kicks, escapes from chokes, grabs, bear-hugs showing hard hitting, fast paced, non stop use of techniques to defend yourself.
Alain draws on his background from Judo,  Hapkido, the military, working as a bodyguard and bouncer, to formulate the 165 minutes of this tape.  The video, as the title suggests, is all about blending several martial arts into a system for defending yourself from real attack. In this video Alain provides the viewer with a simple set of effective options which they can use to stun or disable an attacker so that they can escape safely.
Burrese sets the stage by using the big four of Western Punches: The Jab, The Cross, The Hook and the Upper Cut combined with straightforward footwork. He shows the best target for each punch and then shifts gears and introduces the palm heel strike as a hand-saving alternative for violent confrontations. He then covers a number of other alternative strikes. Alain is all business. There are few bells or whistles in these tapes, though they are professionally produced with good visuals and camerawork that seamlessly shows alternative angles. There are reality inserts of attack scenarios each with a successful defense built out of the elements covered in the tapes. Even if you are well versed in Self Defense, there will be something for you on this video. It is pretty much crammed with quality information.  Alain is to be commended for using different size partners including Thad Brinkman who looks like he could fill most doorways.  Alain talks about modifying techniques based on the size of your attacker.  It is always nice to see training partners that look like they could really do damage.
The material on the tapes covers basic upper body strikes, and lower body strikes in a variety of attack situations.  Pat Sergott, my long time training partner, calls this ""A to the face, B to the Base"". Alain Burrese displays this same no nonsense, cut to the basics approach.",1014508800,11,2744,5.057522123893805
