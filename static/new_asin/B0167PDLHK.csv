8735807,5,B0167PDLHK,"This is a brilliant documentary that anyone interested in decolonizing the anthropocene should see! I'm writing about this visually gorgeous film in my new book Beyond the Pink Tide. The documentary an endless source of contemplation about Indigeneity in the Americas, archipelagos, and the importance of the ocean, water, and historical memory, especially in relation to thinking about the future of our planet. As will all of Guzmn's films, this is an extraordinary viewpoint into the submerged traumas of the making of the Chilean nation state, this time focused on the Southern peoples of Patagonia, such as the Selk'nam peoples. He shows the deep connections of British colonization to the Pinochet regimes, especially through a focus on Isla Dawson. See this!",1515888000,,765,5.330578512396694
8735808,2,B0167PDLHK,"Can't take the liberal babbel.  They should have called this documentary, ""Water is God.""  The main focus is that water is life, water is EVERYTHING, and water is everywhere (nothing else matters), and that the indigenous people from Chile were one with the water, but now they're not allowed to be, because the Spanish colonists took over and changed their ways, and prohibit them from living the life they once did.  They're not allowed to travel around in their canoes rowing about on the sea from island to island.  The Chilean government apparently considers this to be a dangerous lifestyle, and prohibits them from living this way.  (Not sure I buy that.  Maybe they just got too comfy with the modern lifestyle.)  I'm not sure about the history of the massacring of the indigenous tribes of Chile, as the documentary states, there could well be some truth in that.  Of course many of them died from smallpox and/or other European diseases that their immune systems had not built up a tolerance to, which happened in Mexico with the Aztecs as well.  I'm not buying all of the blabber this film is selling, though. This documentary spends waaaaay too much time focusing on water.  Literally.  Most of the film is just images of water in different forms, and the sounds of water, interspersed with brief scenes about how the indigenous tribes were one with the water and survived solely on what the water provided them with, with the point being that that in and of itself is a good and admirable way to live, as opposed to how Christians live--putting God in the center, and water being one of the gifts He gave us (that perspective is not respected).  Oh, and the tribes believed that when they die they turn into a star.

Very slow moving, keeps going back to scenes of water, pretty boring, in my opinion.  And, extremely liberal agenda by film-makers.",1492646400,,1861,4.7213622291021675

8735812,5,B0167PDLHK,"This is one of the most remarkable documentaries I have seen in recent years, if not in all my life. It is better described as a ""visual essay,"" with carefully composed frames rather than raw documentary footage. It is a meditation on Chile, from the distant past through the horror of the Pinochet dictatorship up to the present, with the old ways rapidly being pushed to extinction. It is a magic moment when the filmmaker asks some very elderly Indigenous People to try to recall their original language. After a halting start, the words start to come back to them and flow. You say you have no interest in the nation of Chile? This film addresses everything, ""from nothingness to eternity,"" to borrow the title of a Mahavishnu Orchestra album. I would award this project TEN STARS if I could.",1468627200,4,796,4.692857142857143
