3546484,5,B001E6HUWK,These maybe from the 50's and 60's but I would be watching TV today if it was this good. You have to use you brain. The characters have held up over these many years. Well worth a look.,1222387200,8,185,3.8947368421052633
3546485,5,B001E6HUWK,"I appreciate the reasons for consumer gripes regarding the Perry Mason DVD releases. Like other Amazon reviewers, I'd like to pay less and see complete seasons rather than half-seasons released at a time.

I'd also like two-dollar gas, killer abs, and a winning lottery ticket, but they're not gonna happen either, so I'll just say here and now that Paramount has done a superb job of remastering the PM series for us diehards, and I encourage the company to stick with the project.

When I look at the quality of the prints, that the episodes have been restored in their entirety, that the episodes are generally longer than most of today's popular dramatic series, and the plain fact that paying several bucks for each episode of one of my all-time favorite shows is no big hit on my wallet when it's spread out over months and years, I'm okay with the pricing and staggered releases. (And no, I don't work for or represent Paramount, and yes, like everyone else I have only so much disposable income in any given month.)

I even bought the PM 50th Anniversary set for its extras and for the lovely Barbara Hale (sometimes joined by series producer/director Arthur Marks) providing the intros. It was worth the price and the duplication of episodes.

I expect many of my fellow Amazon reviewers will take the time to skewer me for my take on Paramount's approach, and that's okay. It's all a matter of opinion and perspective. But for me, the fact that Paramount is providing us fans with such great prints of the PM series is cause for celebration. ""You get what you pay for,"" the saying goes, and my money is being well-spent.",1221350400,92,1630,4.668989547038327
3546486,1,B001E6HUWK,"CBS/Paramount's approach to the 3rd season of the resplendent ""Perry Mason"" (both Vol. 1 & 2) is hard to figure out, given the okay whole season releases of 'The Wild Wild West' & 'Mission Impossible'.  On the positive side we have crisp audio and video with vivid gray-scale resolution.  And of course beaten to death, (and deservedly so) is the exorbitantly priced, rinky-dink half season releases with downgraded packaging.

Either CBS/PARAMOUNT lost a bet or perhaps they might going down the road such as Universal Studios.  With Universals abysmal treatment of Jack Webb's TV shows, Universal is now farming out series such as Adam-12 & Dragnet to SHOUT Factory.  CBS/PARAMOUNT would be wise to move ""Perry Mason"" to a secondary player such as SHOUT, Infinity Entertainment or others that do a superb job in releasing whole seasons with excellent definition & reasonable prices.  Sounds like a solution that would make everyone happy. (Note that the first four seasons of Raymond Burr's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ironside-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000MGBSQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ironside - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;are marketed by SHOUT!

3546487,3,B001E6HUWK,"According to Gary Tooze at DVDBeaver, this Perry Mason boxset has episodes that are interlace scans, not progressive scans.  For the price CBS/Paramount is charging, they could have at least mastered these 3 DVDs in progressive format.  The lack of the usual extras is another sore point, especially the failure to include optional English subtitles.  DVDs of TV series costing a lot less have multi-language subtitles and sometimes even alternate language tracks (French, Spanish).  CBS/Paramount just used closed captioning.  But for fans of the show, there is no choice but to get these overpriced DVDs, now available in very clear (to me) black and white.  50 years was a long wait, though.",1220745600,15,694,5.151785714285714
3546488,5,B001E6HUWK,"I love the show so I'll pay the price for it but releasing it in half-seasons 6 months apart is ridiculous. Original fans old enough to have watched it in the 1950s and 60s will be dead by the time the last season is released.  Release the DVDs faster, CBS!!",1219881600,12,258,4.16
3546489,5,B001E6HUWK,"Baby boomer TV classics are a niche market.  Pay the freight, or get a new hobby.  By the way, the ROUTE 66 series used as an example of complaining bringing the prices down on classic TV series box sets omits one detail: no more ROUTE 66 season boxes are scheduled for production.

These are great shows, beautifully written and acted, and the DVDs look better than when first aired.",1219449600,22,384,4.536231884057971
3546490,4,B001E6HUWK,"Crying Cherubs was good. That tough and sexy Liza kind of stole the show, though its always a pleasure listening to Abraham Sofaer. Irate Inventor was my favorite from that season. Anything to do with technology, including stolen, in this case, often makes for a very interesting story. Speaking of which, I was sorry to learn of the passing of Big Dave Brockman. I never had the pleasure of meeting Dave, but he was clearly a brilliant electrical engineer, computer scientist, animal rescuer, nature photographer, Perry Mason fan and more. His site helped me connect with my favorite episodes. Truly, a fine man.",1491004800,2,613,4.961165048543689

3546512,5,B001E6HUWK,"Perry Mason Season 3 Volume 2

These fourteen TV films from 1960 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes, usually the Preliminary Hearings, often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. A story adapted from a novel has the year.

On very rare occasions, the humor seems forced, but the writer's rarely go for humor.  And if, at the end of the episode, the culprit cracks and confesses -- well, that has to be endured in good humor.  Perhaps it is because, back then, they couldn't believe a murderer would remain unconfessed!  Excepting these flaws, this is a very good series, and season 3 was no exception.

3546655,5,B001E6HUWK,"Perry Mason, the one hour television show displayed originally  fuzzy black and white on a round screen disappeared from original telecasts in May, 1966. It lived on in re-runs through the end of the millennium and re-appeared as a series of TV movies in the eighties featuring a bearded Mason and the ageless Della.

But 1960 was a special year indeed. Firstly William Talman, who played Hamilton Burger the brilliant but hapless Los Angeles County District Attorney was temporarily kicked off the show following his arrest following a raid at a ""wild nude party"" in Hollywood in March 1960, resulting in a stream of appearances by lesser prosecutors. As a result he is absent from many of the episodes in this series.

Secondly the Mason series, always a home for some of the better character actors of the era, had in the second half of the season, some amazing cast members. Louise Fletcher, later to win an Oscar, plays Gladys Doyle in The Case of the Mythical Monkeys. Norman Fell, wearing a silly thin mustache, plays a character named Casper Pedley. Joining them is B-movie Diva Beverly Garland. And that is just in one episode.

These episodes are all well-written, although few lawyers ever object as Mason and Burger do that the evidence is ""irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent."" In ""the Case of the Prudent Prosecutor"" Burger actually calls Perry to defend his old friend (played by J. Pat O'Malley). In the ensuing preliminary hearing Mason exposes a corporate scandal worthy of the wall street Journal. Barbara Bain appears in another episode the Weary Wildcatter where a con man sells several hundred percent in an oil well that happens to come in.

If you love Perry Mason, this second part of the third season will be rerun as often on your DVD as Ted Turner did on WTBS.",1228867200,21,1791,4.82084690553746
3546656,5,B001E6HUWK,"Perry Mason is as much a part of American culture as apple pie and mom. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone of any age who doesn't at least recognize the name. Erle Stanley Gardner's books have millions of devoted fans. The television show it spawned was fabulous as entertainment, and today is widely regarded as one of the best shows the medium ever produced. Perry was the attorney you wanted on your side in a jam.

Raymond Burr had some good roles in films, but will always be remembered as Perry Mason. It was Gardner himself who picked Burr, even though the studio only agreed to let him test for Perry if he would test for Burger too! Barbara Hale was his pretty secretary, Della Street, who kept Perry human and was in love with him. William Hopper was the dapper detective, Paul Drake. He had a playful and flirtatious relationship with Della but every viewer knew that secretly her heart belonged to Perry.

William Talman as D.A. Hamilton Burger would almost be ready to gloat, Lt. Tragg (Ray Collins) not far behind, when Perry would spring his client by revealing the real killer on the witness stand. There has never been anything close to it in genre on television since. Its mix of drama, noir, and humor, and its truly likable characters, made for terrific viewing.

Season three had some great episodes, including a case where Paul was the accused, in a twisty tail of blackmail and murder. Releasing them in half seasons, the first half on volume one, the second on volume two, may indeed be an effective but annoying marketing scheme, but with all the junk out there we're lucky to actually have a few worthy releases such as Perry Mason even available.

Season three, beginning in October of 1959 and ending in June of 1960, is as follows: The Case of the Watery Witness--The Case of the Garrulous Gambler--The Case of the Blushing Pearls--The Case of the Startled Stallion--The Case of Paul Drake's Dilemma--The Case of the Golden Fraud--The Case of the Bartered Bikini-- The Case of the Artful Dodger--The Case of the Lucky Legs--The Case of the Violent Village--The Case of the Frantic Flyer--The Case of the Wayward Wife--The Case of the Prudent Prosecutor--The Case of the Gallant Grafter--The Case of the Wary Wildcatter--The Case of the Mythical Monkeys--The Case of the Singing Skirt--The Case of the Bashful Burro--The Case of the Crying Cherub--The Case of the Nimble Nephew--The Case of the Madcap Modiste--The Case of the Slandered Submarine--The Case of the Ominous Outcast--The Case of the Irate Inventor--The Case of the Flighty Father

This was one of the best dramas ever to hit the air. Seeing it today reminds us just how good television can be, but is often not. It's a bit of nostalgia and a lot of entertainment for TV fans. Fred Steiner's ""Park Avenue Beat"" remains one of the most recognizable themes ever heard. A must for any serious collector.",1224979200,31,2893,4.778
3546657,1,B001E6HUWK,"Even though my comment ""AMEN"" to Mr. Morgan's review indicated my total agreement, I'd like to add my thoughts to another change that is slowly growing in frequency and aggravation.  DVD sets that suddenly loose their surface color graphics which relate to the TV program/movie's theme, characters or genre.  NOW WE GREET the burnished silver disc surfaces with glossy silver writing.  They all look the same, whatever the TV show or movie it is!  PLUS, they are hard to read unless the light hits just at the right angle.  (Even then, some of the print is so small, it's nigh onto impossible to read.)

The 1st time I noticed this was ""Happy Days"", Season Two.  Season One the surface of the DVDs gave the discs an appearance of being a 45 rpm record. This makes sense, teens listening to rock 45's.  But I guess the producers didn't think about aesthetics, just $$$.  Here are a couple more absurd examples:  #1- ""7th Heaven"", Seasons 1-5: Very nice character portraits that illustrated how the character's appearance changed as the years went by.  Many times I've looked at the discs, thinking, he/she sure has grown, or lost weight (Rosanne) etc.  Season 6 arrives.  Generic silver discs with no portraits or color, or anything appealing.  This unwelcome discovery ruining the inherent joy of their arrival Or, how about, #2- ""Touched By An Angel""?  Seasons 1-3, colored discs depicting the themes and the characters.  Season 4 - OOPS! ""Plain-Jane"" silver.  C'mon studios, give some thought to what appeals  to the customers!

Are the studios saving money?  I really don't know, but I've been in sales all my life and those years taught me the axiom ""PRODUCT APPEARANCE AFFECTS SALES VOLUME""!  Almost as much as what is does.  Hard to believe they don't know that.

On the same theme, these double-sided discs that show fingerprints so easily, but theoretically save studios production costs.  Since the advent of Double Layer discs, very few extra long movies are now printed on a two-sided disc.  Here are 2 different product offerings,  each the result of what subjects were of importance to studio officers sitting at their long, lavish mahogany tables in boardrooms resembling the Taj Mahal, pining over either how the economy hurts their sales volume, OR, what could be done to improve their product's value and appeal to the customer.  (One, the antithesis of the other).  #1- ""Northern Exposure"":  Seasons 1 and 2, illustrated discs; Seasons 3 and 4, double-sided discs; Seasons 5 and 6, back to being illustrated.  They may have finally moved in the right direction, but continuity is non-existent.  #2- ""The Waltons"":  Certainly one of the most loved TV series. but every year produced on 2-sided discs.  It is bad enough to squint our eyes in able to see what we are putting in our disc player, but come Season 4, the producers didn't even bother to print which disc # the DVD was!  I had to write in that tiny circle the correct disc # by looking through a magnifying glass at the even tinier ID number in that circular info area.  (Example - 110884.1 or .2, or .3, etc.)  The decimal point indicating which disc it is.  Isn't this insane?  I feel ridiculous writing this!  Why bother?  BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW LITTLE THE MAKERS CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS whose purchases pay their salaries & bonuses.  End of soapbox.",1223769600,13,3329,4.8212389380530976
