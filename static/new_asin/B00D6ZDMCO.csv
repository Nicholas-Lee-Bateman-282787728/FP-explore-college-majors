8590172,4,B00D6ZDMCO,I got more out of this film than what I expected.  The run time says 79 minutes but the movie itself runs over 90. The picture quality is actually pretty decent.  I would give it a 9 and a 10 on the sound. Most of these full moon grindhouse releases have good picture quality (not all of me)  but this one I was surprised,1487635200,,321,3.984375
8590173,2,B00D6ZDMCO,"Bad plot.  There is no horror sensation.  The peeping and blood-sucking scenes fail to create any wish to scream.  Were Wolf, not.",1468627200,,130,4.818181818181818
8590174,4,B00D6ZDMCO,If you give this movie a chance you'll be blown away by ALL of it. Top notch performance by Borel. Has something for every grindhouse/genre fans. Would make an awesome double feature with THE HOWLING.,1447718400,,200,4.742857142857143
