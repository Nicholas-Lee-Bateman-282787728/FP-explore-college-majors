8447497,5,B004XWBOWE,"I have the 2 hour version, (there is an 8 hour totally comprehensive version as well). This is a very good DVD Documentary. What Doctor Marquis does is take us though many of the theories about what may happen on December 21 2012 and shows us what has validity and what does not. So most of you know or have been told that the Mayan Calendar ends on December 21 2012 and that singles the end of the world. Marquis completely debunks that. Its simply the end of a cycle (the 5th) and another one will start on december 22 2012. There are other prophecies, Bible Codes, Nostradamus etc., all pointing to something happening in 2012 and he takes them all on in the 8 hour version, In the Shorter version he talks on the major ones, Bible code, Mayans, Cherokee Prophecy, New Age Prophecies, Scientific theories dealing with sun flares and the planate Nibiru (Black Star) returning, etc.,

Marquis gives us a history of Bible code, what it is (Equidistant Letter Sequences) where it came from and who uses it, and shows us how Bible code of past events is good as an authorization code for the Bible but is unreliable for predictions. Many have not come true including predicted nuclear wars and world wars with dates already past. He also makes the argument that its divination to try and predict the future in such a way. We have clear bible prophecy in the Bible we do not need to search for hidden esoteric knowledge.

Marquis Debunks the theories of Nibiru, solar flares destroying earth, and Earth Curst displacement. He also discuses the Cherokee prophecies as well as other native american prophecies and shows how they do not predict the end but simple an end of a cycle and a beginning of another. We are being lied to, we are being propagandized to fear the end, more on that later.

Next we get to the nitty Gritty the New World Order. Who are they, and what do they want. Marquis gives as a good analogy about 2012 and that is the crises of 2000. The predicted disaster did not happen but a big changed did happen. Governments, Businesses and individuals all upgraded the computers and this was a huge shift and is what all the propaganda was all about in the first place. Marquis shows us the Georgia Guide Stones, with its new 10 commandants. These commandments show us the NWOs goals, with he first one being very chilling, Maintaining earth population at under 500,000,000. In cause you don't know we would have to eliminate 93% of the population to get to this number. Marquis takes us on a tour of the Rose Cross, Madam Bovansky, and many occult personages, beliefs, places, to show us what they believed and where they got there information.

We learn a possible reason for all the fear mongering and propaganda. We are being prepared for a spiritual Paradigm shift to the universal mind to clear the way for the acceptance of Anti Christ, One world government, One world religion and loose of our national sovereignty and all our rights.

And in Closing we are told what we must do to be saved, this is the most important part of the whole film. Accept the LORD JESUS are our Savior and be Born Again. This is a must watch for anyone concerned about 2012, and really for anyone, we all have been so exposed to the propaganda by the media and entertainment industries.",1323388800,4,3284,4.568760611205433
8447498,1,B004XWBOWE,"Simply boring, the information contained would be more presentable in a book, rather than a DVD. I couldn't help but to fall asleep, even though I am deeply interested in the 2012 contraversy. I didn't even bother to play the 2nd DVD!",1318636800,2,234,4.595238095238095
