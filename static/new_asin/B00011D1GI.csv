8005111,4,B00011D1GI,"It's nice to see a film that stars Frank Buck.  This is a typical Alpha print, one that I always hope will make it to the end without any problems.  This one didn't make it without a couple of dialogue splices.  No Alpha logo present.",1427932800,,234,4.155555555555556
8005112,3,B00011D1GI,"Well, if you like ""jungle"" stuff, you probably need this to flesh-out your collection.  The image degradation is to be expected due to the age of the film.
Frank Buck was a world-renowned big game hunter of his time, and I suspect he was probably the one who started the genre of the  big game - safari - type films.
The setting is in the jungles of Indonesia.  Frank goes there because of lots of tiger attacks on the local natives.  These attacks are interfering with the rubber production on the plantations, and therefore effecting the supply of needed materiel for ""our"" war effort (against the Japanese and the Nazis).
The story line is canned and rather poor.
The acting is poor.
I have seen other Frank Buck films in the past, and I have read his book ""Bring 'Em Back Alive.""  This film does not reach those standards.",1391472000,,826,4.516778523489933
8005113,4,B00011D1GI,"This DVD was fun as nostalgia.  I'd read Bring Em Back Alive when I was a kid and bought the book again - old fashioned, but fun.  When I purchased this I thought it would be actual footage I saw several years ago of Frank Buck when he was collecting animals.  Instead, this was a rather cheesy movie - still good to watch if you like really old movies.",1238025600,,353,4.086956521739131
8005114,5,B00011D1GI,"Having discovered Frank Buck through the short-lived TV series ""Bring ""Em Back Alive,"" I'm thrilled to unearth anything I can about the original ""Indiana Jones!"" This is a true classic about a true classic! Campy good excitement - wish I was there.",1207526400,3,248,4.928571428571429
8005115,3,B00011D1GI,"Tigers are running amok in the jungles of Damang, disrupting Allied communications and killing local natives.  Frank (Bring `Em Back Alive) Buck is called in to rescue the situation.
  On his arrival at the MacCardle Rubber Plantation Buck discovers the natives chanting about `chindags' - evil humans who assume the form wild animals, in this case tigers.  After a little investigation Buck concludes ""The japs, or the `monkey people,' as they call `em, have possessed the souls of the tigers.""
  TIGER FANGS was directed by Sam Newfield, who is probably most famous for THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN (1938), a western with an all-midget cast.  Apparently he worked pretty fast; TIGER FANGS is one of sixteen movies he directed in 1943.  Frank Buck is a credible actor, although it had to be because of his fame as a animal collector that he's in this one.  Another kinda recognizable face is that of Duncan Renaldo, who played the Cisco Kid in movies and on television in the late `40s and early `50s.
  TIGER FANGS is an entertaining little movie with the good guys triumphant in the end.  Buck had a reputation for treating his animals humanely, so parents won't have to worry about scenes of animal abuse or mistreatment.  There are some racists attitudes, like the above quote, that might make this one unsuitable for children in some households.",1085616000,2,1346,4.850877192982456
