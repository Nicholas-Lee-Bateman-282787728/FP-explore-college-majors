8404910,4,B003T1GUPQ,"On the 2nd day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...ROH Motor City Madness 2009. The  Bryan Danielson-Rhett Titus match was a good opener. The Austin Aries-Silas Young match was entertaining to say the least. The Brodie Lee-The Necro Butcher match was a pretty good brawl even with the countdown ending. The Roderick Strong & Erick Stevens-Jimmy Jacobs & Delirious-tag team match had a lot of interesting and creative spots in it but still good. The Jerry Lynn-Tyler Black match was awesome & interesting too even with the time limit draw. The Non-Title match between Nigel McGuinness & Jay Briscoe told a good story with Nigel being smart and treacherous and Jay just being a Briscoe. A bit one-sided compared to most of Nigel's matches, but then Jay is not really a contender. The World Tag Team Title match between the team of Kevin Steen & El Generico against The American Wolves was Good, old'-fashioned tag goodness. Plus, it left the door open for the Wolves' eventual win. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1418601600,,1016,4.740112994350283
