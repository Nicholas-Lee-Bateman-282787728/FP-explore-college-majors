2959163,5,B000W07EKW,"The Bourne Trilogy is one of the greater trilogies that has been released. Each movie just as intense as the last, these movies fail to disappoint.  If you're a fan of any of these movies, then the trilogy is a must have. Also, there won't be a boxed set released in HD DVD any time soon, so this is a great deal!",1195084800,5,313,4.048387096774194
2959164,5,B000W07EKW,I love all three Bourne movies and have been searching for them in HD.  I have priced these individually at different stores and have found Amazon's bundle price to be by far the least expensive. Get these while they are available....it is a great deal!,1194912000,18,253,4.622222222222222
2959165,5,B000W07EKW,"I am a fan of serious literate movies and also a fan of action flicks (a mystery writer and also a writer of serious literary fiction as you can see from my web site [...]) and the Bourne series is a canny, sometimes brilliant hybrid of genres.  Yes, there's exciting, breathtaking action all the way through, but there's a great deal more.  The movies start with a man who's lost his identity, and the loss goes much deeper than he realizes.  He seeks both knowledge and revenge once the depth of his damage becomes clearer, and learning who he really is and what he's done, and what the cost has been to others, is a terrible but thrilling burden (for us, anyway).  What the reviewer below completely missed is the subtle, touching performance by Matt Damon who does a great deal with not a lot of dialogue--though the reviewer below exaggerates about the script.  Damon is remarkable.  The other cast members along the way, like the wonderful Franka Potente from ""Run Lola Run"" and of course the inimitable Joan Allen add depth, humor, passion, darkness.  At a time when government policies are so controversial, the trilogy is a powerful condemnation of victory at any cost thanks to Matt Damon's layered, sophisticated performance.  Yes, there is bravura camera work that some people don't like, and utterly original long sequences that are close to astonishing, but there's also real heart to this movie, thanks to Damon, who by the way has a superb ear for languages.  He listens.  Watch him watch the world around him and listen to it, scanning for threats and clues--you won't be disappointed if you're open minded.",1194825600,50,1624,4.788530465949821
2959166,5,B000W07EKW,All three of these films are amazing. Fans of Matt Damon must buy this DVD. The only other recommendation is also to buy the books which are even greater that the movies,1194307200,9,169,4.3125
2959167,3,B000W07EKW,"My review mostly relates to the 3rd installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" I rate that movie only one star. However, because this set includes the much better ""Bourne Supremacy,"" I'll average the rating out to three stars.

Bourne Ultimatum (movie #3) is similar to Bourne Identity (movie #1) in that it exists simply for the sake of the action. There's hardly any literary content at all. It's just a straightforward plot that moves the action along. It's like so many other action movies. Sure the production is impressive with explosions, stunts, car chases, fighting, etc, but as far as dialog, motivations, characters, plot twists, or anything else clever, that's all been carefully stripped out. That doesn't cut it for me and I rate this movie low. I like the Bourne Supremacy (movie #2) the best. That one has more story.

Other reviewers here agree with me on the above points, but I disagree with them on the excellence of the action. I don't think it's all that great as I'll explain below along with my low opinions on the lack of story. I agree with another reviewer here that my review on the literary merit of the movie is a waste of time. The movie is about action and that's it. Critiquing its literary merits is like critiquing the safeness of a motorcycle. It's simply not about that.

Anyway....
The girl in this movie hardly speaks at all. She just walks around looking dumb and worried. If the girl was paid by the line, they paid her about $50 for her ""role."" Her close-ups become comical because repeatedly they cut to her, she looks worriedly into the camera, and then doesn't speak.

As many others have pointed out, the shaky camera work is annoying/nauseating/amateurish direction. I really hated it and it really did make me sick.

The story has a long, straightforward build up to an ultra-lame, straightforward conclusion, which makes me feel like I wasted my time. What's the big deal about his training anyway...you just need to train him as a sniper, which is no big deal, and then you're done. What Jason does is not that different than any other soldier, especially a sniper. Much more interesting was Bridget Fonda in ""Point of No Return"" and her cycle of training, initiation, and wanting out.

Again in the ""unintentionally funny"" department, we get comedy/spoof/""so bad it's funny"" like running commentary:
""He's looking right at her!""
""He drove off the roof!""
As if we, the audience, couldn't see that he just drove off the roof. Actually this comedy material was some of the best fun this movie has to offer.

Jason takes the unneeded/indefensible risk of calling the CIA security down on him before he even cracks the safe. No trained burglar would do that. He just needed to hang up the phone as soon as the guy answered and said his name. And if cracking the safe was that easy the CIA wouldn't be using that safe. How did Jason know that the spook used his name as the safe voice password? He could have used any phrase. Ludicrous.

During the chase where the assassin chases the girl, Jason repeatedly jumps through the windows. Once is enough, twice is repetitious, thrice is an eye roll. He did it, like, six times. Severe lack of imagination on the part of the movie makers. Plus, that assassin must be a super blood hound to be able to track the girl from the street as she runs around on the rooftops.

Grade (for Bourne Ultimatum): Waste of time.",1194307200,8,3397,4.686241610738255

2959221,5,B000W07EKW,"Yeah, I know it's been a while since these came out. It's even been a while since I bought the trilogy on a previous special. But since I intend to see the new Jason Bourne film, I'm here revisiting these. In the interest of space, I'll just comment generally on the whole trilogy.

Pros: obviously responsible for bringing back the sense of high stakes for an individual human being who has knowledge that could be dangerous for other human beings... and for the corrupt power brokers who were responsible for his role in the first place. Famously directed and filmed in gritty-realistic ""documentary style"" by indie leaders Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass, spread across a number of evocative European locations, and featuring some of the most hardcore, brutal-looking fight choreography I've ever seen.

Particular standouts, to me:

1. Clive Owen's professorial assassin who goes after Bourne with all alacrity... and then his very mournful, very human acknowledgement that he was doing a job, and had become something he regretted, as he dies at the end.
2. Bourne ""interrogating"" Nicky about his ""first job"" in Berlin, with a gun to her head. The flashbacks, the look of pure disgust with himself as Nicky sobs, Julia Stiles very convincingly portraying a woman who's sure she's seconds from death. Fine, FINE work from Damon and Stiles, IMO the moral center of the second film.
3. In all three films, very creative approaches to how Bourne solves problems in action. The fact that he creates chaos and then very calmly and methodically takes advantage of it in smart ways, like ripping an evacuation plan off the embassy wall and following it in the first film, or the very simple purchase of a pre-paid cel phone that he palms into the reporter's pocket in the second film. Less wiz-bang gadgetry, more tradecraft. Love that.
4. Chris Cooper in bulldog mode in the first film. I do NOT want this guy angry with me.

Cons: If the Bond franchise generally shows England at its jingoistic worst, the Bourne franchise gives us a CIA that is essentially rogue all the way to the top, deliberately, assassinating U.S. citizens, disappearing millions in seed money to PRIVATE (of course!) Russian oil interests who are about to be exposed by Russian POLITICIANSbecause, you know, Russian politicians are noted for being honest brokers of truth and justice. Joan Allen's Pamela Landy saying ""I didn't sign up for this. What they did to you. This isn't who we are"" is eyeroll-worthy. That sort of sentimentnoble though it isis far too nave for a deputy director of anything in the CIA. Bourne falling madly in love with Marie, a flighty woman with no visible means of support, no ability to plan for a future, and no recognition of the reality that the hunt for them will never be over until Bourne ends it (by whatever means). Hinting at a previous relationship between Nicky and David Webb (Bourne's real name) solely for the purpose of motivating Nicky's help... then doing nothing more with it (because it would spoil the idolization of the dead Marie). Treating Nicky, who is competent enough to manage logistics for all the Treadstone agents and who risks her life trying to help fight Daesh, as just another girl to disguise and send off. Weirdly sexist, and worse, a near-unforgivable underutilization of Julia Stiles.

Gosh, those cons sound harsh. But they sure haven't stopped me from watching this trilogy many, many times. Did I mention Matt Darmon's uncanny ability to look physically ill every time he kills someone? Did I mention the emphasis on tradecraft? Did I mention rooting for Nicky to do more?

Highly, highly recommended.",1470009600,,3644,4.907467532467533

I purchased a player I thought would play these, and it turns out to be a player that makes regular DVD's play like a HD DVD.

I had to take off a star for the Bourne Supremacy because, while the picture is very sharp and clear, it's also very green (and in some scenes very yellow - Pam Landy's hair in a lot of her scenes looks like it was colored with a yellow highlighter - very distracting).

The special features are fantastically done on all the movies. The ability to see notes about the characters and gadgets in the film (either while it's playing or separately) are great and really give you the option to get more insight into the character motivations and the technical aspects of the film.

I highly recommend this on blu ray, it's well worth the money, especially if you're a Bourne fan. Just be aware that Supremacy looks a bit green (like Fellowship of the Ring on blu ray)",1382140800,,934,4.488235294117647

Matt Damon's action is outstanding, though I heard he wouldn't do any more after the third which left us with that rather unsatisfying  Bourne movie in 2012.

The storyline and execution is as taut and coiled as Bourne himself (amnesiac assassin attempts to piece together his entire identity and the damage that occurs with helpers and hinderers).  The Blu-ray quality was very very good and got stronger each film.  It's rare to have a trilogy with such strong individual offerings, but Bourne is exactly that.  Highly recommended.",1372550400,,677,4.991071428571429

The problem is the same with most Universal Studios blurays, that screen saver that comes on if you pause for a short period of time that freezes up the player.  I like to walk around during movies, but with many you cant do that.  Depending on your blu ray player, it may be very inconvenient.  Wish the Blu Ray format didn't have so many kinks.

Also, too many movies are coming out on sale for a week, then being offered at a lower price a week later.  Makes me wonder what is happening with the blu ray industry.",1371081600,,545,4.1923076923076925

The powers that be wanted more action and less storyline for this movie, but director Doug Liman and Matt Damon both refused - and the results were fantastic. The next two movies saw a new director - much to the detriment of the series. The excessive camera shake was, well, just plain stupid, and gave me a massive headache just watching them.

2960296,1,B000W07EKW,these movies wouldn't be bad if they weren't filmed by a cameraman having an epileptic seizure every time there was suppose to be action.  I guess they do that because the actor can't do action scenes competently.,1355875200,,213,4.756756756756757

All are in 2:35:1 or 2:40:1 aspect ratio, which means you get to see all or most of the movie that the director wanted you to see. The Blu-Ray on all {3} movies is really nice. I have these in regular Dvd & the Blu-Ray blows them away. I can only say that the audio sounds really nice to me, although I listen with external speakers hooked up to my stereo, nothing fancy. All {3} movies have lots of special features that I think you will enjoy too. These movies have it all, Drama, Suspense & Action. The car chase scenes throughout the trilogy are probably the best I have ever seen. They were really well done. One of the best scenes was in the last movie where that guy was chasing the beautiful {I think} Nicki. The suspense & action was first rate. I really enjoyed these movies & I think you will too.",1353628800,,949,4.272222222222222

It is my favorite of the 3, so asked Amazon if they could replace that one disc with one that hopefully works as well as all the other BluRay DVDs I've purchased from them.

2960314,5,B000W07EKW,The Bourne Trilogy on blu-ray is amazing! I kept hearing about the Bourne series for a while and wanted to see for my self if it was as good as I was told. It was better! If you want a action/thriller with an amazing plot this is it. I looked for a long time to decide which set I wanted to get and this one does not disappoint. Between watching the Mission Impossible trilogy or this one I definitely choose this one.,1351209600,,418,4.109756097560975

2960317,5,B000W07EKW,"These movies are great, but I have to admit that I didn't like them the first time around.  I think that's because I was expecting them to at least resemble the original Ludlum books, but let's face it - these are only ""Bourne"" movies in the sense that there are a few names that are the same, and a couple of similar scenarios.  The plots have almost nothing to do with the original books.  But once I got over that and looked at these movies as a completely independent creation (that just happened to share their names with a book franchise that I love), I was able to really appreciate just how great these movies are.",1349654400,,622,4.344827586206897

2960319,4,B000W07EKW,"These movies are wonderful, but to say that they are based on Robert Ludlum's books is ludicrous.  The only thing these movies have in common with the books of the same names is that many of the characters have the same, or similar names.  There is no commonality of plot, or action, and the movies stray farther from the books as the stories and episodes progress.  Good GAWD, Hollywood!!!

The only way to get out of the ""freeze"" is to unplug your Bluray player.  The other two discs play OK.  I'll now be returning this box set to Amazon and buying each disc separately.  I saw the movies originally in the theaters, and of course, the movies themselves are excellent.  The one star rating is only because one third of this trilogy is defective.

UPDATE: October 1, 2012
This update is to mention that Amazon was extremely prompt in it's superb return process.  I'm still leaving the rating at one star because it's for the item purchased.  I would give five stars to Amazon for their execution of their return policy.",1348531200,6,769,4.521739130434782

2960325,5,B000W07EKW,"I've been a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since it came out in the movie theaters and has revived the spy action thrillers and twists which has become mostly action here and there without much a story to work on. The Bourne Trilogy set comes in nice package fit for 3 discs and basically if you have watched all three films and wanted to know more of the background you will not be disappointed with the set! Here is my review broken into each of the movie included.

The Bourne Identity
The extras included in this disc are great! Even some alternative scenes that are not found on previous DVD releases. This is a must-have for the fans. I won't give any spoilers. Even a psychologist's diagnosis of Jason Bourne!

The Bourne Supremacy
Action sequences are given due credit here and even documentaries. There are extras after the car chase scene in Goa, India and interviews with Matt Damon and Franka Potente.

The Bourne Ultimatum
There are SO MANY extras here! Many documentaries and sections about the film and Robert Ludlum! You'll enjoy this very much!",1347840000,,1056,4.666666666666667

2960329,3,B000W07EKW,"I really like the movies, and the sound track. The audio codec's are great but Bourne Identity does not play on my Sony BDP-590. The Bourne Identity freezes up the machine to the point that I have to unplug it and wait for a few seconds and then plug it back in to get the player unfrozen. The other movies play great, but with this issue I'm going to research and see if there is another release. I don't say if other BD players are having the same issue, but after two sets I'm done for now.

Over all I was really dissapointed that the Bourne Identity stopped at the same place in both box sets, and had to return them both, but I'm giving the set three stars because of the way Amazon handled the issue by issuing a full refund with paid UPS pick up.",1347494400,2,754,4.129251700680272

Colors are crisp, sound is awesome on my surround-sound, & action as filmed is perfect for the big screen; right in my face.
The additional features accompanying each film were great: especially deleted scenes, add'l features alone were worth the purchase.  You must get this!  One of the best Blu-ray packages ever offered.",1347321600,,488,4.9753086419753085

First, I didn't enjoy the last installment (The Bourne Ultimatum) because I was looking for more action, but after watching it again (on DVD) I understand the last movie was to tie up the loose ends and give the audience a better understand of the 'bigger picture' of the character... Well written story line (that I now understand and respect)!  I already have each movie on DVD, so when the Blu-ray Box Set was available I had to buy it!

This is the boxed, full-size Blue Ray containers, one for each of the movies. This set was released at the same time as the Thinpak in 2010 at a noticeable higher price back then. This set was $60.00, while the Thinpak was sold for about half.

2960348,5,B000W07EKW,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you will see that I'm not much of a fan of modern films, save aside a few, so keep that in mind, so whats my verdict on these? well as you can see from my review title, I absolutely loved these movies, these are really well done and entertaining, one thing that I really like is that they are not CGI filled movies, it seems like old school cops and robbers, with a little bit of a modern feel with the technology and cell phones and what not, another thing that I like that seems to differ from most modern action movies, is that there is no stupid comedy parts in them, as they are very serious movies, with plots that actually mean something (unlike movies like Transformers and Bad Boys and such), and the 3rd thing I really like is that these movies are really well acted, of course we know that Matt Damon is a terrific actor, so that goes without saying, but the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the woman who plays Pamela Landy, and Julia Stiles is wonderful, and pretty at the same time, so double bonus.

These movies are filled with great action sequences such as hand to hand combat, gun fights, and great car chases, and the suspence just keeps you drawn in, and keeps a hold on you, and keeps your interest, meaning they don't stray off.

Not much more that I can say that everyone else hasn't said already, I watched all 3 of these films in 2 days, and I found all 3 of them to be fantastic, this boxed set is really worth the $20.00 or so dollars you pay, you're getting 3 great movies, plus a bunch of bonus features and the presentation is nice, three slim cases inside of the outer box, that is fine with me, good job Universal, now if only they would put more out like this!",1343606400,,1746,4.224550898203593

I ordered the Trilogy on the 13th and received it today the 16th and that was with the Free Super Saver feature. The Trilogy was only $29.99 so that is $10 apiece and I paid more than that for the DVD's.  I haven't even had time, yet, to see the blu ray's.  I know I will enjoy them since I have a new Samsung Blu Ray 3D player and 42 inch Visio 3d 1080i 240 htz TV, and a new HDMI 7.1 Pioneer amp with Home Theatre Type surround sound speaker system with 200 watt sub woofer---sorry bout that---but I am excited not bragging----well, maybe a little bit.  I don't go out much so I save my money to get a quality Movie experience at home.  Now, If I could only get them to lower the price on the Star Wars Blu Ray extravaganza.  Actually, the DVD's video looks pretty good when they are up-converted.  But, still kind of lacking in the sound department.
The Bourne Identity---the Blu Ray is definitely better than my DVD version (even with the 1080i up-convert.  The Video is clearer, the DTS Sound is Super and the Extras are worth buying the Blu Ray (if for no other reason).  I spent hours last night and I only watched the Extras---picture in picture----and stand alone docs.
I didn't even get to the Commentaries and I had a whole nights entertainment with
only one disk.

All three are fantastic movies, so if you don't own them on another format, I highly recommend this. One note, there's not really anything special about the boxed set per se. If you already own a couple of the movies, I'd suggest just buying the other movie individually. But if you don't own any of them, you can stop reading reviews.

A pause timeout and other functions ends up in a ""no man's land"" mode which just shows the ""Universal"" logo.  Going to the menu is locked out here (that's really stupid authoring).  The ""play"" button seems to not work, although it really does ... it just takes 45 seconds for it to actually do anything (be patient and you won't have to eject and re-insert).

Aside from one or two quibbles (why does mr superspy who memorizes every liscense plate in a parking lot at one glance need to have something implanted in his hip to remind him of his bank account?  Just in case he loses his memory?) the movies themselves are wonderful.

Here are the pros and cons of this particular edition of the films:
Pros:
-the blu ray transfer is good, with a fine picture and sound.
-the extras are fun.

Cons:
-These are the single-disk versions of the movies.  No dvd or additional disks such as digital copy.
-At times the picture quality was not as good as I might have hoped.  Still very good, but a bit off.

All in all, highly recommended.  If you like Bourne, you will like this package.  If you like action films, you will love Bourne.

The picture quality in these 3 movies is irregular.  Maybe that was intentional on the part of the film makers but the levels of detail and the color palettes for indoor vs outdoor shots is quite different.  The choices seem to be changing here and there within a movie, and also from one movie to the other. The audio on the other hand is quite punchy in all three disks.  The one drawback in this collection (thus only 4 stars) is that the ""extras"" (deleted scenes, alternate beginnings and endings, etc) are presented in standard definition and they are pretty poor.

2960411,5,B000W07EKW,"This series is really well done and the Blu-Ray only adds to the quality of the films.

(1) The first film is very understated in its action sequences.  Only 1 explosion, completely justified, and a chase scene that rivals any in film history.  To get an idea of the accuracy just watch the sequence when the police officer on the motorbike flips over the car and smacks his helmet.  Every sound is authentic and really adds to the overall product.  I will say that the greatest disappointment in the films is the female lead played by German actress Franka Potente.  Being of German decent and speaking German quite well I can say that she over acted many scenes and was never really a well-developed character.  She just whines throughout the whole movie being surprised by the same issues over and over again and saying scheie every two seconds.

(2) The second film is where it gets a little fuzzy on cinematography, but the story is so sound that you don't mind the seizure inducing camera movements.  Again the action is understated and all reactions seem appropriate.  The opening scene of Bourne and Marie crossing the bridge being chased by a sniper is still my favorite seen (see above for reference).  The new director I think takes the 'sense of action' idea a bit too far, but again the Blu-Ray captures everything in the scenes and the sounds perfectly.

(3) The third and final Matt Damon Bourne movie is a nice combination of the first two films.  The scenes are well thought out and the plot is quite deep and comes to a solid conclusion as to why and how he became the way he is.  You will get a little bit of the blur 'sense of action' junk from the second film but it is much reduced and returns to the actual story.

Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of spy movies.  While Bourne and James Bond are really nothing alike, because of the series success they are constantly compared.  If you like big explosions, gadgets, and amazing vehicles and women keep watching the Bond films I certainly do (Skyfall is Amazing!).  If you like deeper characters, realism, and amazing hand to hand combat then Bourne is for you.  I like them both, but they should be held as exclusive from one another.  I think the Blu-Ray, like most films, is really only needed for cinephiles or audiophiles. So if you are a general movie watcher the normal DVD set should be fine.",1311033600,,2404,4.546511627906977

2960414,5,B000W07EKW,"I watched these movies when they came out
Identity - meh
Supremacy - didn't score any points
Ultimatum - pulled the rug out from under me
Watched them all again and finally got it - a rare case of both sequels being better than the first movie.

How many action movies do you see in which the protagonist fights using a book, a magazine and a ball-point pen?
Or in which he goes through mayhem just to say sorry to a girl, for killing her parents?
Or in which he looks apologetic after just choking an assassin to death?
Bourne is no Bond...whew.

The guy has no snappy one-liners, no sunglasses, no sharp clothes, no cool gadgets, no fast cars, no techno-weapons, no beautiful women hanging off his arm, and loses his girl by the second act. He has no team to back him up, there are no mega-explosions or bullet-spraying gun battles, and he is not out for revenge or to save the world. Its about a man trying to understand who he is and why he's done the things that he has.

And all this wrapped up in incredible action movies that have the least staged-looking hand-to-hand combat scenes that I have seen (Supremacy and Ultimatum). Fights with no background music, no slow-motion, all the grunting you'd expect during such brawls and the fighters just trying to use what's around them to their best advantage - close to gritty, real-world stuff.

Downsides - some scenes look a little cheesy (Identity), some a little motion-sickness inducing (Ultimatum) and some repetitiveness (all 3).

But somehow I can watch these movies over and over again...and John Powell's music is excellent.
This is simply a unique series in the action movie genre. What else can I say except that Damon as Bourne will be missed - a flawed guy in a sea of modern-day superheroes. He was what he battles now - an assassin. I like that he's so human.",1309737600,2,1829,4.564024390243903

He is Rambo with an IQ. And like all fictional heroes he is the only person in the world who can kill with one shot, while no one else can shoot straight.

What is nice about the trilogy is that the movies mesh very well and get better as they go along. Like LOTR it has one climax scene after another. This is a thinking man's action-drama.",1297123200,3,837,4.264150943396227

I will not comment on the quality of the films, because most people have seen them and you know if you like this type of action movie or not.  I do enjoy these films, and so I wanted a collector's set.  The extras in this set are:
- The box is designed to look like a safe deposit box, and is very nice.
- A passport booklet (the size of a standard dvd box), with a simple and not too impressive design.
- Inside the passport booklet is a bonus disc with a few interview-style documentaries about the legacy of the Bourne series, including archive footage of Robert Ludlum, author of the novels on which the films are based.  The disc has less than an hour of total content, and the material wasn't particularly interesting.

If the above-mentioned exclusives don't interest you, it would be cheaper to buy each of the films separately.  Here are the exact DVD versions that are included in the Jason Bourne Collection:

2960496,4,B000W07EKW,"The Bourne films suffer from the same problem as do the recent Bond offerings - the world has fundamentally changed. The old adversary, the Soviet Union, has gone, and so has the master terrorist Carlos ""the Jackal"", Bourne's protagonist. Therefore, any updating unavoidably means major changes in plot. However, I think the updating has gone rather well, certainly better than the Daniel Craig Bonds.

In cartoons, the characters are completely indestructible. Think of Wil-E-Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. Jason Bourne is the equivalent of an entire Roadrunner cartoon, in that he has Wil-E-Coyote's apparently bottomless pit of ingenuity and finance and his ability to survive complete disaster, combined with Roadrunner's perpetual success in outwitting Wil-E (meep-beep!).

So, given the complete impossibility of the whole enterprise, what makes these films so entertaining? Much of the credit lies with the excellent Matt Damon, who somehow makes into a living, breathing creature the character of Jason Bourne, the killing machine with no past, and, if various nefarious Washington types can help it, no future either. In addition, the one-man-against-the-system drama, especially a system gone bad with a fearsome apparatus and that apparently holds all the cards, is always a good story line - one tends to root fiercely for the little guy. If you want spectacular chases and fight scenes, forget James Bond, this is where it's all at - Bourne's ability to (almost literally) leap tall buildings with a single bound and demolish half-a-dozen armed assailants equipped only with a toothpick (okay, okay, I made that last bit up) is wonderful to behold. The last of the three films is especially good, as a particularly nasty CIA director is constantly outwitted by the ever-versatile and ingenious Bourne, and finally receives his come-uppance.

As I say, all of this is as inherently absurd and cartoonish as Bond or Bauer, but I find it much more entertaining, and I hope that the proposed (and currently stalled) fourth Bourne film goes ahead.",1275350400,,2059,5.290519877675841

The plot in all its continuation is amazing, to say the least! It is in a smooth, constant flow and it brings the viewer into the shoes of Bourne as he tries to fit all the puzzle pieces back together. You cannot help to feel that emotional connection throughout his journey and this is one of the reasons why I am really intrigued. Action, adventure, thrills and twists, character development, and in moments when Bourne is taking a ""rest"" after a heavy chase (For example, when he gets on the train in Supremacy after the hectic chase), you will feel sympathy for him.

** SPOILER ** When Bourne confronts the daughter of his earlier assignments, the mother and father, and tells her that he was the one who killed them (It was believed to be a murder-suicide and the general public believed it), this was and still is the most dramatic scene I will never forget! ** END SPOILER **

The cinematography is well put also. More of a documentary style in the fighting (Awesome choreograph as it looks genuinely authentic) and chase (Cars included, LOL). It might be a bit nauseating from the shakiness to some, but I found it to be most exhilarating.

2960518,5,B000W07EKW,"Being a fan of Ludlum's ""Bourne"" books, I was eagerly anticipating the first film of the series to see how exactly Doug Liman and writer Tony Gilroy were going to adapt the anti-hero to a more modern setting. Taking it from the jungles of Vietnam and the pursuit of Carlos the Jackal, and making it into a high-speed, high-intensity techno-thriller that is quite literally about identity was no small feat. And also making it a really intelligent, extremely well-acted actioner was a task that Liman, Gilroy, and Damon were able to pull off quite well. THE BOURNE IDENTITY set us up for everything that was to come: a very independent attitude brought to the Hollywood style of filmmaking; a great cast of indie players, like Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Clive Owen; a refreshing approach to the immediacy and improvisation of hand-to-hand combat; it's a near-perfect modernization of the tale of Jason Bourne.

THE BOURNE SUPREMACY took that even further. With director Paul Greengrass coming in, who, instead of opting for Liman's more distanced approach to the action which is more appropriate for a Hollywood film, took us directly into the action. With fast cuts, shaky camera shots, and use of sound so that we no longer seem like we're watching the combat, but actually a participant in it, Greengrass (and returning writer Gilroy) sets a slightly different tone, and heightens the intensity that much more. And with the additions of Joan Allen and Karl Urban and Martin Csokas, and keeping Cox, Stiles, Potente and Cooper, Greengrass knows how to do it right. This is most certainly not a film for purists of the Bourne books because this film perhaps has more deviations than the other films from the book's plot points, but it keeps with the main plot, which is the Bourne impostor designed to bring Bourne out in the open. Also Greengrass seems to have more of a handle on bringing a more intense and more personal tale out of the character of Jason Bourne than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.

THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the ultimate icing on the cake of this series, and is quite simply the best film of the series. Greengrass comes back onboard, with Gilroy in tow as well, and they bring actors like Paddy Considine, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and the always-great David Strathairn to round it out. The film is ingenious in many ways, most specifically how it ties this film to SUPREMACY, because scenes that we saw in the previous film reappear in this one in very, very suprising ways. But Greengrass ups the ante once again, and brings Bourne full circle to where it all began. And again, Greengrass never lets up on the viewer for a second once the intrigue and the action and the suspense begin. He lets those moments build to a full boil, and just when you think you can't take it anymore, he goes for the kill.

It's obvious the mark that the BOURNE films have left on the contemporary spy thriller. If you watch the Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, it seems like there are literally entire scenes stolen from the BOURNE films. Unfortunately that didn't help that film. But fortunately, if it can help to reshape the genre of the spy thriller and bring it in a new and more vital direction, with less emphasis on gadgetry and more on character while keeping the globe-trotting action and suspense, then it makes the BOURNE TRILOGY all that much better.",1265500800,,3432,4.716666666666667

2960533,4,B000W07EKW,"For me this is a series that grows on you. When I first watched this series I hated it for its shaky camera work and jarring transitions, then as time goes by I enjoyed it more and more as do most people. The movies are what I call true sequels taking place moments after each film e.g. Back to the Future and The Lord of the Rings are other examples. The movies have an over arching storyline, with the exception of the first because it can stand on it own or with the rest of the series. Now on to a review of each movie.

The Bourne Identity is about a man who wakes up with amnesia and discovers he's a government assassin who failed to pull the trigger. Soon after said government finds out he's alive wants to tie off loose ends and by tie off I mean kill both Bourne and his ally Marie an American traveler who helps in his evasion. The film ends on a happy note with Bourne reuniting with Marie in Greece.

The Bourne Supremacy takes off where the first left off Bourne is with Marie in India and is being hunted by the CIA for a bombing he is framed for. Marie is shot and Bourne is on a quest for revenge and eventually clears his name and the film ends with Bourne going on a crusade to apologize to the families on the people he assassinated.

The Bourne Ultimatum is Bourne trying to find his true identity and still being pursued by the CIA.

Nothing else to say except these movies are nothing more than a thrill ride with an engaging story that should be watched if you even have a passing interest in the genre.",1261267200,,1528,4.187074829931973

2960540,5,B000W07EKW,"James Bond is too pampered and spoiled.  Take away his ridiculous gadgets and fancy car, and he would be lost.

Not Jason Bourne.  Bourne relies more on his wit and resourcefulness to make the most with what he has.  Whereas Bond needs a tricked-out Aston Martin with rocket launchers and oil slick dispensers to make it through a car chase, Bourne only needs a beat-up old Cooper Mini.  Whereas Bond sticks out like a sore thumb wherever he goes, Bourne is like your real-life covert operative who does his best to look ordinary, blend in and not attract attention--  You'd never spot him walking through a crowd at a train station.

With the much more intelligent approach that gives up nothing on action, the Bourne trilogy is a refreshing take on the spy genre.

Like Moby says in the Extreme Ways theme for the Bourne trilogy, I would stand in line for this.

The blu-ray discs in this trilogy look absolutely fabulous on my setup (Sony Playstation 3 / Sony Bravia KDL-52W300 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV).  I had rented the standard-definition DVDs from Netflix before I bought the Blu-Ray Bourne Trilogy, and there is absolutely NO comparison--  On a proper setup, blu-ray totally blows away the standard-def DVDs.

2960544,4,B000W07EKW,"Matt Damon *is* Jason Bourne.

I enjoyed these movies tremendously, so I'll just address why it's missing a star.

First, in principle, the box set itself is essentially just a re-release of the existing single DVDs. The only thing you get is the nice case, plus a bonus DVD (the one in the big passport). This didn't bother me, since I never had the individual films. But for someone who already does, it's a big ask to pay for a shiny box and three featurettes.

Second, and with regard to Bourne Identity, the disc itself doesn't exactly match what's on the back of the DVD case. Specifically, the Director's commentary is missing.

FYI: less than a year after this box set came out, Universal re-released (again!) the same three movies, this time without the fancy box or bonus disc, as the ""Bourne Trilogy.""",1254096000,4,812,4.6573426573426575

But I have watched all three movies back to back twice now trying to figure out what all the hype was about and why these films were so hugely successful....and I guess it's the simple excuse for action through some of Europe's most beautiful cities and of course it's always fun to see some hero completely destroy a seemingly invincible system...but my gosh people....IT'S THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!! I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!! Yes if you have seen the first movie you have seen them all!!!! A show down with fists and kicks, a couple of shoot outs and a car chase....and yep some smug suit gets taken down for some reason...I don't know.

It has plenty of bonus materials for replay value, the physical DVD cases are slim and do not take up much room, and the price is great. It's perfect for someone like me who has not upgraded to blu-ray yet nor wish to pay blu-ray price for the trilogy, which is $72.99 at Amazon as of June 2009.

The picture definitely seemed a little clearer than the DVD's but the sound was incredible. Already good on the DVD version in my home theatre this took it to a new level and I'm not regretting the $65 for upgrading my set. The best thing about it was I have a Sony Blu Ray and a Sony 7:1 AV receiver. Every movie I've played I've had to cycle through my settings to get the best sound. I'm not sure if it was just this movie, my set-up or what but it wouldn't let me change the setting before the movie got started saying it wasn't used. The sound was absolutely perfect so I'm glad it didn't let me mess with it. Motorcylces racing from back left to front right speaker, gun shots echoing and traveling through from front to back. My son and I were laughing at times at how cool the sound was. Visually I use an HD projector that throws a very clear 100 inch picture, I lose a little video quality but this was the best home theatre experience I've had.

2960572,5,B000W07EKW,"""The Bourne Trilogy"" captures each of the three Jason Bourne action thrillers in one package full of first rate action entertainment.  Loosely based on three novels by Robert Ludlum, this trilogy focuses on amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, on the run from mysterious enemies and looking for the key to his missing past.  Matt Damon is absolutely superb in what has become an intensely physical but emotionally understated signature role as Jason Bourne.

""The Bourne Identity"" introduces Jason Bourne as a wounded man found floating in the Mediterranean.  Rescued by a fishing boat, the amnesiac young man is sent on to a bank in Zurich, based on an account number found implanted in a capsule under his skin.  Along the way to Zurich, Bourne discovers he has lethal fighting skills, which become essential to his survival when his appearance at the bank triggers a manhunt by the CIA.  Bourne will have to run for his life, accompanied by an attractive German drifter played by Franka Potente.

In ""The Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne is hiding in India with his girlfriend from the first movie.  He struggles with unclear memories of his life as an assassin.  When Bourne is framed for a murder in Berlin, the CIA and a mysterious Russian oil magnate take up lethal pursuit.  Bourne must return to Europe for a fateful confrontation with his pursuers and with his past.

""The Bourne Ultimatum"" picks up Jason Bourne where the last movie left him, wounded, on the run in Russia, and suffering flashbacks of his indoctrination as an assassin.  A journalist provides a clue to the program that created him and Bourne will race the CIA to his starting point in New York, hounded by fellow CIA assassins.

Joan Allen has a recurring role as a sympathetic CIA official who is a sometime ally in Bourne's quest for his identity.  Julia Styles also has a recurring role as a CIA logistician who figured in Bourne's original assignment.  Top notch casts fill out each of the three stories.  The movies themselves were filmed in a jagged, sometimes grainy, and always fast-moving cinematic style, full of stunts and carried by Jason Bourne's uncanny instincts for coping with any situation.  If the respective plots have a few logic holes, the action moves fast enough through a series of exotic locations to more than distract the viewer.

""The Bourne Trilogy"" is very highly recommended as first rate entertainment for modern fans of the spy genre.",1239408000,5,2445,4.907542579075426

If the movie was not more than 3 stars in my opinion I would not have purchased the Blu Ray. I already have the 3 titles in standard DVD. Could be just my imaginatioin but I think the video quality on the Identity and Supremacy is superior to the Ultimatum in this Blu Ray set. This could be because the Ultimatun on the standard  disc was already of high quality so I do not see an appreciable difference in the Blu Ray.
The Bourne Triology Blu Ray is far far superior to the Godfather Trilogy in Blu Ray. The Bourne Blu Ray trilogy is a good buy and a must have for all Blu Ray 1080p nuts.

My older processor is able to handle the Dolby 5.1 PCM but doesn't decode DTS or DTS HD Master audio.  TV speakers worked via HDMI audio and the player RCA analog out worked - which is how we watched it.  This detail not clear on the Amazon site, but is on the box fine print.

I have to say that I have rented these movies a few times on DVD and enjoyed them every time but the Blu-Ray version brought it up to a whole new level. The packaging is very cool with a magnetically sealed box that opens to reveal the three movies in the standard BD case.

I was a little reluctant to pay +$40 for this version because our Samsung LN52A850 does such a fantastic job of up scaling our DVD's that it is often hard to tell the difference between a DVD and BD. After viewing The Bourne Identity I can tell you that it was well worth the extra money. The picture and sound were amazing and I enjoyed the movie like never before. I will say that the car chase scene was a little too loud for me compared to the rest of the movie and I ended up turning the volume down some for that. I think they could have toned it down some but that might just be me.

The discs come with many extra features like BD live and I have not checked any of that stuff out so I can't provide any feedback on that but I will say they have done a first class job with this release and if you like the movies it is well worth it even if you already have them on DVD.",1233705600,,1243,3.968
2960620,5,B000W07EKW,"It's hard to imagine a better trilogy of films more suitable for Blue Ray than the Jason Bourne movies. Each film looks absolutely fantastic, the sound is spot on, and the films themselves are masterpieces by thriller standards. Bourne has become iconic; the Bond of the new generation. Matt Damon's all-american good looks, intensity, and acting skills give the films a credibility that many movies search for but never find.

There are so many reasons to buy this collection. The transfer quality is nearly perfect in my opinion, but I am not the type to watch the films with a magnifying glass and look for any tiny mistakes. The surround sound is simply unreal. John Powell's score really comes to life and the depth of the sound effects are fantastic. The scene in Ultimatum that takes place in Waterloo Train Station is epic and should go down in cinema history as one of the best cat-and-mouse chase scenes ever made. The storyline is well constructed, believable, and leaves you hungry for more.

Thankfully, there is a fourth Bourne movie in the works, with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass returning to make sure it is done right. I can't wait.

There are few movies I will watch again and again, and these make that very short list. The best trilogy since the GODFATHER movies (sorry STAR WARS fans), these are a no brainer for any movie fan. 5/5 stars.

Movie - 5.0

The first time I ever saw this film series was from a total blind-buy. Previously, I never even wanted to touch it because I had this stupid, unexplainable bias against Matt Damon. To this day, I still can't remember why I had such feelings, but I'm glad I got over it, because The Bourne Trilogy is a masterfully-executed story that has changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. The Bourne Identity starts with the discovery of a man found overboard. He has two gunshot wounds in his back, a Swiss bank account in his hip, and no immediate recollection of who he is. Coincidentally, upon reaching the mainland it seems that he's a master in firearms and fisticuffs when he instinctively disables a couple of poor police officers that just happened to mess with the wrong guy. When he gets to the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport and his name: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). But to his surprise, there's a slew of other passports with the same picture and different names, in addition to lots of cash and even a handgun. Upon setting out to Paris, he meets a woman named Marie (Franka Potente), and the two of them would go on to face assassins and conspiracies while uncovering answers to who he is.

In The Bourne Supremacy, we find the two in Goa living a life of peace after managing to escape pursuit. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. When Kirill attempts to find Bourne and assassinate him, Marie is killed in his stead. And in a rage of anger, Bourne decides to aspire vengeance on all those who had been chasing him. But in the process, he would discover a few more things about his past that would change him for the better.

And in The Bourne Ultimatum, after a British reporter named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) discovers a new Treadstone replacement agency called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), Bourne figures to find the source of Ross' information so he can finally get the answers he'd been searching for, as well as putting an end to these agencies. Upon Ross' assassination, Bourne instills the aid of former Treadstone handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and receives the benefit of the doubt from Pamela Landy as he makes his way back home to New York and discovers the truth to everything he had forgotten.

The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance as even more memories started to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but to many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken).

Video - 5.0

- Video codec: VC-1
- Video resolution: 1080p
- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1, 2.35:1
- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1

The video quality of the series is pretty much perfect aside from the first one. In my initial review a few years ago, I said I wasn't pleased with Identity, but did a pretty crappy job explaining it. After reading up on the technicalities of film-making since then, I've gotten a much better grasp on how to explain and describe these things. That being said, Identity looks very good in terms of black levels, colors, and sharpness. Looking at a lot of the outdoor shots, especially, and a few indoor, the picture retains enough detail that it makes for a pleasant image for the trilogy's initial entry in HD. However, it does suffer from low contrast, giving it a somewhat murky look, and there are several occasions when dirt and a couple of scratches from print damage pop up. It's not terribly distracting, but it is noticeable.

Supremacy, on the other hand, is a major step up. With the changing of director in Paul Greengrass, he gave the image a much more vibrant look that better accentuates all of the aforementioned qualities. Blacks are darker, colors are much more vivid, contrast is better-balanced, and the sharpness is even sharper. Just looking at the beginning scenes in Goa, there's a tremendous amount of color that really adds more life, and the rest of the movie follows accordingly. Some people say the saturation is a little too high, but I'm in the belief that it was intentional since Grengrass is such a visualist. And there's also a good amount of film grain as well, which again, I believe is intentional. So unless you don't like the color timing or are a grain-hater, then those are about the only problems you might have. Finally, Ultimatum has the same kind of photography, only with a difference of intensity. Supremacy ran a little hot in terms of color, but I feel it added to the overall tone of the film itself (Bourne getting hot and angry for revenge, hence the hot look to the picture). However, Ultimatum is essentially where things come full circle and the adventure ends. Because of that, this is probably about as ""normal"" of a color level as you'll get. So there you have it. Aside from the first movie, there's not much else to complain about.

Audio - 5.0

Languages
- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1
- French: DTS 5.1
- Spanish: DTS 5.1

Subtitles
- English SDH, French, Spanish

Again, aside from Identity, the audio is just about perfect. All three movies use the DTS-HD MA codec, and all of them sound fantastic. The only problem with Identity isn't so much the quality, but the quantity. As in the film itself just isn't as heavily-mixed as the others. In his commentary, Doug Liman stressed how he wanted to make Identity a drama first and an action movie second. Because of this, I think it reflects in the sound mix. The actual depth and quality to the track itself is pretty buoyant in terms of separation and directionality and gets especially aggressive during the fight with the first Treadstone agent. Rear speaker activity also gets a really good workout during the car chase sequence when cars start turning the corners. And dynamic range is excellent in the scene where Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character outside the farmhouse.

Additionally, when Greengrass takes over as director for the sequels, the audio gets a tremendous upgrade, just as the video did. Even for as low-key as the opening scenes are in Supremacy, the dynamic depth alone is noticeably louder and more precise. Action sequences offer up even more aggressive mixing such as the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. This scene in particular displays a very exact design that has no music and does a great job isolating its sound effects into the confines of that small, compact area, adding an extra layer of ferocity and tension to it. And the car chase in Moscow towards the end is brimming with activity as the vehicles skid, crash, and break all over the place. But even still, Ultimatum manages to top that. Immersion is outstanding from the crowd noise for the scene at Waterloo Station, isolation is more intense in the fight between Bourne and Desh, and the car chase in New York is a sonic masterpiece of mayhem and music. By the way, John Powell's score is another big factor to the overall sound of these films. His string and percussion works really help to compliment the storytelling that even exudes a subtle amount of LFEs through his awesome drum pieces. Outside from the one minor issue with Identity, all of these films sound superb.

Extras - 4.0

There are quite a bit of extras, but if I were to highlight just one feature from each movie, I'd say at the very least(!) give the audio commentaries a listen. And if you like technical stuff, the U-Control Picture in Picture for Supremacy is well-worth a watch as well.

So there you have it. If you've read my individual reviews for these movies, there's not much else I can say. The Bourne Trilogy is one of the best in its genre, and I'm really thankful for its influence in a lot of other recent entries (the Daniel Craig Bond movies and Liam Neeson's roles in both Taken and Unknown). It refreshed the genre with a mix of mystery, grit, and emotional depth that has really raised the standard. This box set is a very good deal, and I'm glad I made that blind-buy when I did. The A/V specs are essentially perfect outside of the first film, and they're all chock full of meaningful special features. If you haven't seen these films yet, make the time.

The video quality is right where it should be and the audio is there too. The set drops 1 star in my opinion simply because of the lack of a digital copy. In this day and age we are all on the go and most good people don't want to pirate films.

2960629,4,B000W07EKW,"The sad truth is, I only got into this whole Bourne craze last year...I didn't even see Ultimatum! Of course, my cousin thought that was absolutely crazy so she forced me into having a Bourne marathon with her.

And I absolutely, positively, LOVED it. And when I absolutely LOVE something, I HAVE to buy it.

It's a real treat to be able to have all three movies together in a little set you can pick up and watch whenever you like. All the original extras for each movie are included so that's a bonus.

But why only four star? Well, I was slightly disappointed with the packaging of this boxset. For those who were wondering, there are no ""bonus"" features for this boxset - it's basically a hard paper case with three slim DVD cases, each containing one disc, which has the widescreen version of the movie with extras. As one reviewer previously mentioned, if you're looking for posters, cards etc., this won't satisfy you.

The only thing I'm worried about is...what am I gonna do when the fourth Bourne movie comes out on DVD? Will they release another boxset? Will my love for Bourne make me buy that one too? Haha, we shall see...",1232496000,14,1136,4.5268292682926825
2960630,5,B000W07EKW,"Great Buy!

Bourne kicks Bond Butt..!! This a good value dvd pack, with 3 excellent films written as a trilogy. The filming is top notch and adds to the sense of realism. Matt Damon does most of his own stunts and fighting scenes which makes it all actually really believable - there are practically no outrageous ""Bond"" moments which are simply not possible in the real world...

The 2nd film isn't quite as intense but the 3rd is a non-stop thrill ride. Look out for the part of the film in Morocco for some serious heart pounding action...... It's not necessarily about the action but the stress of him being caught that makes this a fantastic film which is so rare for the 3rd in a series.

The Blu Ray version recently released which would be an obvious buy if money is not an issue but this version has loads of extras to keep you happy and you'll be drawn to watch if over a few times to catch all the little subtle plot lines.. Awesome!",1231977600,,944,4.3522727272727275

Unlike a lot of other movies with sequels, all of these are good.  Series like Spiderman, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc... have progressively bad sequels, while this stayed on course.

2960674,5,B000W07EKW,"I have seen a lot of spy films.  For suspense, mystery, complexity that the viewer must unravel, and that strange quality that allows you to suspend your disbelief, this is undoubtedly the best trilogy of spydom I have ever seen.

You start with Bourne waking with amnesia, struggling to remember who he is, but with his calculating mind and deadly skills wired into his DNA.  He is in danger and meets a wonderful girl, who is kind of a lost soul with great potential, that life force that one finds in sudden, true love.  She becomes his guide to the search for - or effort to reconstruct - his personality.

Due to politics and a murderous bureaucracy, Bourne functioned as a kind of ultimate assassin.  (""I don't send you to kill...I send you to be invisible because you don't exist."")  Over the course of 3 films, we learn details of what he was made to be, and how.  At the end, we see that he hated what he had become, which in combination with his ""conditioning"", was the source of his amnesia.  It was psychological - wanting to find his earlier identity, which was taken from him in spite of his protests - as much as physical.

His new life, of course, is tragic.  This makes it psychologically real, combined with the greatest acting that I have ever been found in a spy series.  In my view, Damon is one of the greatest actors alive, and he gives life to this role in a way I have never seen in a spy film.  The most interesting things is that each film in the series adds to the others, deepening the themes while offering heart-pounding suspense and sufficient realism and detail to enter the imagination.  Yet not everything is explained, so that many of the biggest conclusions lie under the surface.

If I could give this series 6 stars I would.  I have watched each film numerous times and am never disappointed - it just gets richer.  This is one of the rare films that transcends the book.",1206316800,,1910,4.45821325648415

You can even look for yourself because the third movie is HDDVD with normal DVD on the other side.  That's really my only problem with the movies, I hate having those dual sided discs.  Mostly because I am paying more for two formats, one of which I don't want.  Additionally then they can skip the effort of making any art on the disc.  Although, this it the first time I have gotten a dual sided disc that actually made it perfectly clear which side was which on the labeling.

2960704,4,B000W07EKW,"In 2002, we were made privy to the world of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a man with no memory who found he had a knack for all things espionage. As he tried to find himself, he fell in love and ended with the woman of his non-existent dreams.

In 2004, Bourne returned and his love was killed before his eyes. It seems someone framed him for a theft and the CIA is out to get him once and for all. Having warned them he would retaliate, he fulfills his promise.

Now it's 2007 and there is more to the story of Jason Bourne, aka David Webb. Bourne is on the trail of the CIA still, hoping to find out more about his past and why he can't remember a thing.

When Bourne resurfaces and contacts a news reporter who may have information for him, the reporter is killed and the hunt for Bourne begins anew. But one thing that these CIA officials seem to never learn is that just who is hunting who is a question that should have been asked long ago.

The head of the CIA (Scott Glenn) brings in NSA member Noah Vossen (David Strathairn) and Pam Landy (Joan Allen) to use the full resources on hand to find Bourne. At the same time, they are trying to track down the link that contacted the reporter. An attempt to tie up what they consider loose ends results in more death and more reason for Bourne to tie up loose ends of his own. A solution needs to be found and Bourne will find it.

Damon does an awesome job of making the difficult seem easy. The fight sequences are top of the line, fast moving and totally believable. His acting comes through as well, never resorting to action and nothing else. You believe that his is a troubled mind that will pull out all the stops to solve the mystery.

Now, for fans of the series of films there is a must have on sale. THE JASON BOURNE COLLECTION is a box set with perks galore. Not only that, they've gone creative on the packaging, making the box look like a security box from a bank, a crucial element to the story.

All three films are included in the set, all done to look as sharp and clear as possible. As well as the films and their own special features, there is another disc packaged in what appears to be a passport. This disc contains features about author Robert Ludlum, the creation of the Bourne character, a look at the success of the series and original trailers for all three films.

For thriller fans, for spy fans, for Ludlum fans and especially for Bourne fans, this is the set that they'll want to see under their Christmas tree. And for all that you get, it's well worth the expense. Bourne is back in a big way.",1200700800,,2577,4.25562372188139

The Bourne series is extremely good; lots of action, plot twists, and a vulnerable yet strong hero.  The movies mesh well and the supporting characters are well cast.  I try to only purchase movies that I know I will enjoy watching many times. Since HD DVD is new and I do not know who will win the HD wars (HD DVD vs BLU RAY) I am especially careful about HD DVD purchases.

Watching all three on 1080p was well worth the price of admission. Bonus Features of HD-DVD discs are good extras not found on the regular discs.

Perhaps you should be more specific in your descriptions of the items, as we weren't able to watch the first two movies.

The bonus disc is just 3 interview type shorts. I would have rather gone with the bestbuy exclusive edition which is supposed to have a metal case and bonus features that sound more interesting. This is a good set if you don't already have the movies, but the bonus disc is just a bonus disc and nothing special or something to look forward to.

I think the difference is that they kept it to the point. These are action films and only action films. Very little of any thing else crept in. Romance was kept to the first one, instead of a new conquest for each. No comic relief. Just good old fashioned none stop action. In fact if you have a heart problem the fight scene with the reporter, in Ultimatum, might do you in. ;-)

It was also nice that the was very little cursing and nothing explicit in the sexual arena, just implied in the first movie only and the violence was not unnecessarily graphic. I could watch it with my teens comfortably.

The set was also put together nicely, the bank deposit DVD case and passport were nice touches.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Supremacy/dp/B0002ZDVEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Supremacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B000VWYJ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>&nbsp;all tie together nicely. Is it necessary to view them chronologically to comprehend what's going on? Probably not. Does it help? Most definitely. So this collection is perfect for anyone like me that has never seen the first two of the three films.

Writer Tony Gilroy adapted all three films to the screen from three Robert Ludlum novels of the same name. Identity has a different (little known) director than the (little known) director of Supremacy and Ultimatum...but you'd never know it; all three are as hectically paced with fight and chase scenes that will blow viewers out of their chairs. So kudos to Gilroy for putting together 3 scripts that each director could easily translate onto film.

Getting chased is the story of Jason Bourne's life. Fighting those who dare to chase him is Jason Bourne's game. Bourne is a government agent with an 'identity' crisis. And if there was ever a guy who could say, ""the world is out to get me,"" and mean it, it's him. These three action-packed movies will keep you on the edge of (if not knock you off of) your seat for a good 6 hours.

2960793,5,B000W07EKW,"Wow! These 3 films are just terrific! I read the first Ludlum novel (IDENTITY) in 1980, and I've been an avid fan ever since. The 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain was pretty good, but then came these 3 films, and now, for me, Matt Damon simply *is* Jason Bourne. This package has all 3 Bourne movies+extras in a ""Swiss bank account"" box, complete with a cool mock-passport that has a special extra inside--a 4th disc with a nice bio of Robert Ludlum. And the silver box looks great on my DVD shelf. I'm 50+, but I feel like a kid again.

As for the 3 movies themselves, what can I say that hasn't already been said? They're great. Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass are fine directors, and they seem to be inventing a new way to film action thrillers. The cast is first-rate, and the action sequences are among the best ever staged. The scripts have cleverly updated the original novels to reflect current events, and there's just the right somber, serious tone to them, especially regarding the central character's search for answers about his former life. There's been a lot of argument about the lightning-paced editing and the naturalistic lighting and the hand-held cameras, but I think these elements give the films their sharp edge and constant sense of immediacy. And Damon's portrait of the tormented hero is one for the books. Any way you look at it, the Bourne trilogy is incredibly intelligent, entertaining, state-of-the-art filmmaking. (And you'll love the cool packaging, too!) Highly recommended.",1197590400,6,1519,4.887596899224806

2960796,5,B000W07EKW,"The Bourne trilogy is an action packed, no-nonsense, saga that follows the protagonist, Jason Bourne, on a whirlwind adventure across the world. Strangely, he is simultaneously fighting to find who he is and running from the secrets he unburies. These movies put you in the grit and chaos of a post-Cold War spy game that plays out in some of the most thrilling locales in the world. The characters are relentless and, unlike other spy movies, the imperative behind their actions will strike a nerve with even the most callous movie-goer. The movies are not about grand schemes to overthrow the existing regime. Rather, they are about survival, finding out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and if there really is a difference. The confusion and chaos of clandestine ops is clearly exaggerated, but it also never felt so good.",1196812800,9,840,4.8
2960797,4,B000W07EKW,"I will start this with saying I HATED Live Free or Die Hard in the theater.. when I watched it s second timr.. I realized.. there was a bit, not much bit a bit more to it.. the whole Justin Long character being the lens of which we see the chaos the world is thrown in..

NOW.. relating to Bourne. Yes.. there were those long sequences of action.. with car crashes and chases.. that seemed inexplicable, almost.. BUT comparing it to a mindless action flick, like Die Hard 4 for example.. where the good guy has been shot.. bleeding is now driving a trailor tractor rig being shot out by missiles from an F-35 with the bridge he's on exploding RIGHT behind him.. as he jumps off the bright RIGHT before...

OK.. Bourne has always been about the action.. that's true.. It is by and far an ACTION film. BUT I also agree with a previous poster. In the first film we are stuck with Bourne.. trying to figure out WHO he is.. which follows through all three films ending in an almost CRUSHING revelation in the third film.. In which Bourne really blames eevryone for what he becomes *SPOILER* ultimately Bourne must find.. he has to blame himself. *SPOILER*

BUT.. the big thing really is.. that Bourne was from the beginning like most action heroes.. a reluctant one.. and still is.. unlike Rambo who would lay down the mantle for piece.. but be roused back into it. Bourne would have been content trying to piece himself together and stay a quiet anonymous existence living in India.. or wherever he wants.. without the gunplay and the killing.. these were never something that felt missing from him.. unlike Rambo who would never truly be himself without being through some.. torture or fight. Granted in some of the films.. we see some depth to Rambo, mostly through his end monologues (although there is a fantastic quiet scene in part II on a river boat, I am sure most Rambo fans know it). Bourne, on the other hand.. isn't that. He's very reluctant.. and sorrowful. Realizing what he was.. and.. trying for a quiet moment to atone for the wrong he has done.

This is what has really made Bourne something very different, unique and special in the action field. Granted.. he's part MacGyver.. and unstoppable when he wants to be.. but he's also one who can fight tooth and nail.. and then feel the depth of the wrongs he's done.

Ultimatum is a very odd film.. technically a PREQUEL (yeah it threw me off as well going in) AND a sequel rolled into one. Bourne finally discovers what he was.. and who he is. a very satisfying wrapup to the series.. unlike a previous reviewer, I can only say the Bourne series has gotten BETTER with each successive installment. And if there'a a fourth, I hope its great.. but if there isn't.. then that's ok too.. this is an END.. and a good one at that.",1195862400,2,2787,4.521825396825397

Still, the movies are great, probably the greatest spy films since 007.  There's not a weakpoint in the trilogy, and I loved the way it ended; a coda to the way it began, underwater.  Damon is pretty convincing, doing a lot of his own stunts so you can see his face close-up during chase scenes.  I also like the implied former romance with Julia Styles hinted at in Ultimatum.

3193662,5,B000W07EKW,"I am a fan of serious literate movies and also a fan of action flicks (a mystery writer and also a writer of serious literary fiction as you can see from my web site [...]) and the Bourne series is a canny, sometimes brilliant hybrid of genres.  Yes, there's exciting, breathtaking action all the way through, but there's a great deal more.  The movies start with a man who's lost his identity, and the loss goes much deeper than he realizes.  He seeks both knowledge and revenge once the depth of his damage becomes clearer, and learning who he really is and what he's done, and what the cost has been to others, is a terrible but thrilling burden (for us, anyway).  What the reviewer below completely missed is the subtle, touching performance by Matt Damon who does a great deal with not a lot of dialogue--though the reviewer below exaggerates about the script.  Damon is remarkable.  The other cast members along the way, like the wonderful Franka Potente from ""Run Lola Run"" and of course the inimitable Joan Allen add depth, humor, passion, darkness.  At a time when government policies are so controversial, the trilogy is a powerful condemnation of victory at any cost thanks to Matt Damon's layered, sophisticated performance.  Yes, there is bravura camera work that some people don't like, and utterly original long sequences that are close to astonishing, but there's also real heart to this movie, thanks to Damon, who by the way has a superb ear for languages.  He listens.  Watch him watch the world around him and listen to it, scanning for threats and clues--you won't be disappointed if you're open minded.",1194825600,50,1624,4.788530465949821
3193663,5,B000W07EKW,All three of these films are amazing. Fans of Matt Damon must buy this DVD. The only other recommendation is also to buy the books which are even greater that the movies,1194307200,9,169,4.3125
3193664,3,B000W07EKW,"My review mostly relates to the 3rd installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" I rate that movie only one star. However, because this set includes the much better ""Bourne Supremacy,"" I'll average the rating out to three stars.

Bourne Ultimatum (movie #3) is similar to Bourne Identity (movie #1) in that it exists simply for the sake of the action. There's hardly any literary content at all. It's just a straightforward plot that moves the action along. It's like so many other action movies. Sure the production is impressive with explosions, stunts, car chases, fighting, etc, but as far as dialog, motivations, characters, plot twists, or anything else clever, that's all been carefully stripped out. That doesn't cut it for me and I rate this movie low. I like the Bourne Supremacy (movie #2) the best. That one has more story.

Other reviewers here agree with me on the above points, but I disagree with them on the excellence of the action. I don't think it's all that great as I'll explain below along with my low opinions on the lack of story. I agree with another reviewer here that my review on the literary merit of the movie is a waste of time. The movie is about action and that's it. Critiquing its literary merits is like critiquing the safeness of a motorcycle. It's simply not about that.

Anyway....
The girl in this movie hardly speaks at all. She just walks around looking dumb and worried. If the girl was paid by the line, they paid her about $50 for her ""role."" Her close-ups become comical because repeatedly they cut to her, she looks worriedly into the camera, and then doesn't speak.

As many others have pointed out, the shaky camera work is annoying/nauseating/amateurish direction. I really hated it and it really did make me sick.

The story has a long, straightforward build up to an ultra-lame, straightforward conclusion, which makes me feel like I wasted my time. What's the big deal about his training anyway...you just need to train him as a sniper, which is no big deal, and then you're done. What Jason does is not that different than any other soldier, especially a sniper. Much more interesting was Bridget Fonda in ""Point of No Return"" and her cycle of training, initiation, and wanting out.

Again in the ""unintentionally funny"" department, we get comedy/spoof/""so bad it's funny"" like running commentary:
""He's looking right at her!""
""He drove off the roof!""
As if we, the audience, couldn't see that he just drove off the roof. Actually this comedy material was some of the best fun this movie has to offer.

Jason takes the unneeded/indefensible risk of calling the CIA security down on him before he even cracks the safe. No trained burglar would do that. He just needed to hang up the phone as soon as the guy answered and said his name. And if cracking the safe was that easy the CIA wouldn't be using that safe. How did Jason know that the spook used his name as the safe voice password? He could have used any phrase. Ludicrous.

During the chase where the assassin chases the girl, Jason repeatedly jumps through the windows. Once is enough, twice is repetitious, thrice is an eye roll. He did it, like, six times. Severe lack of imagination on the part of the movie makers. Plus, that assassin must be a super blood hound to be able to track the girl from the street as she runs around on the rooftops.

Grade (for Bourne Ultimatum): Waste of time.",1194307200,8,3397,4.686241610738255

3193718,5,B000W07EKW,"Yeah, I know it's been a while since these came out. It's even been a while since I bought the trilogy on a previous special. But since I intend to see the new Jason Bourne film, I'm here revisiting these. In the interest of space, I'll just comment generally on the whole trilogy.

Pros: obviously responsible for bringing back the sense of high stakes for an individual human being who has knowledge that could be dangerous for other human beings... and for the corrupt power brokers who were responsible for his role in the first place. Famously directed and filmed in gritty-realistic ""documentary style"" by indie leaders Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass, spread across a number of evocative European locations, and featuring some of the most hardcore, brutal-looking fight choreography I've ever seen.

Particular standouts, to me:

1. Clive Owen's professorial assassin who goes after Bourne with all alacrity... and then his very mournful, very human acknowledgement that he was doing a job, and had become something he regretted, as he dies at the end.
2. Bourne ""interrogating"" Nicky about his ""first job"" in Berlin, with a gun to her head. The flashbacks, the look of pure disgust with himself as Nicky sobs, Julia Stiles very convincingly portraying a woman who's sure she's seconds from death. Fine, FINE work from Damon and Stiles, IMO the moral center of the second film.
3. In all three films, very creative approaches to how Bourne solves problems in action. The fact that he creates chaos and then very calmly and methodically takes advantage of it in smart ways, like ripping an evacuation plan off the embassy wall and following it in the first film, or the very simple purchase of a pre-paid cel phone that he palms into the reporter's pocket in the second film. Less wiz-bang gadgetry, more tradecraft. Love that.
4. Chris Cooper in bulldog mode in the first film. I do NOT want this guy angry with me.

Cons: If the Bond franchise generally shows England at its jingoistic worst, the Bourne franchise gives us a CIA that is essentially rogue all the way to the top, deliberately, assassinating U.S. citizens, disappearing millions in seed money to PRIVATE (of course!) Russian oil interests who are about to be exposed by Russian POLITICIANSbecause, you know, Russian politicians are noted for being honest brokers of truth and justice. Joan Allen's Pamela Landy saying ""I didn't sign up for this. What they did to you. This isn't who we are"" is eyeroll-worthy. That sort of sentimentnoble though it isis far too nave for a deputy director of anything in the CIA. Bourne falling madly in love with Marie, a flighty woman with no visible means of support, no ability to plan for a future, and no recognition of the reality that the hunt for them will never be over until Bourne ends it (by whatever means). Hinting at a previous relationship between Nicky and David Webb (Bourne's real name) solely for the purpose of motivating Nicky's help... then doing nothing more with it (because it would spoil the idolization of the dead Marie). Treating Nicky, who is competent enough to manage logistics for all the Treadstone agents and who risks her life trying to help fight Daesh, as just another girl to disguise and send off. Weirdly sexist, and worse, a near-unforgivable underutilization of Julia Stiles.

Gosh, those cons sound harsh. But they sure haven't stopped me from watching this trilogy many, many times. Did I mention Matt Darmon's uncanny ability to look physically ill every time he kills someone? Did I mention the emphasis on tradecraft? Did I mention rooting for Nicky to do more?

Highly, highly recommended.",1470009600,,3644,4.907467532467533

3194443,4,B000W07EKW,"I don't do film reviews as there's plenty of places online for that. This is for the product quality. Overall the films are top notch with the bluray sound being amazing. I had to take off a star for the Bourne Supremacy because, while the picture is very sharp and clear, it's also very green (and in some scenes very yellow - Pam Landy's hair in a lot of her scenes looks like it was colored with a yellow highlighter - very distracting).

The special features are fantastically done on all the movies. The ability to see notes about the characters and gadgets in the film (either while it's playing or separately) are great and really give you the option to get more insight into the character motivations and the technical aspects of the film.

I highly recommend this on blu ray, it's well worth the money, especially if you're a Bourne fan. Just be aware that Supremacy looks a bit green (like Fellowship of the Ring on blu ray)",1382140800,,934,4.488235294117647

3194464,5,B000W07EKW,"This has been my favorite spy trilogy since way back when it was just novels by Robert Ludlum. They brought them up to date without betraying the intrigue and story lines.

Matt Damon's action is outstanding, though I heard he wouldn't do any more after the third which left us with that rather unsatisfying  Bourne movie in 2012.

My family and I just watched these three again after watching Legacy (which is a step down).  We were continually pleased w/ the strength of this trilogy.  The storyline and execution is as taut and coiled as Bourne himself (amnesiac assassin attempts to piece together his entire identity and the damage that occurs with helpers and hinderers).  The Blu-ray quality was very very good and got stronger each film.  It's rare to have a trilogy with such strong individual offerings, but Bourne is exactly that.

The problem is the same with most Universal Studios blurays, that screen saver that comes on if you pause for a short period of time that freezes up the player.  I like to walk around during movies, but with many you cant do that.  Depending on your blu ray player, it may be very inconvenient.  Wish the Blu Ray format didn't have so many kinks.

Also, too many movies are coming out on sale for a week, then being offered at a lower price a week later.  Makes me wonder what is happening with the blu ray industry.",1371081600,,545,4.1923076923076925

The powers that be wanted more action and less storyline for this movie, but director Doug Liman and Matt Damon both refused - and the results were fantastic. The next two movies saw a new director - much to the detriment of the series. The excessive camera shake was, well, just plain stupid, and gave me a massive headache just watching them.

All are in 2:35:1 or 2:40:1 aspect ratio, which means you get to see all or most of the movie that the director wanted you to see. The Blu-Ray on all {3} movies is really nice. I have these in regular Dvd & the Blu-Ray blows them away. I can only say that the audio sounds really nice to me, although I listen with external speakers hooked up to my stereo, nothing fancy. All {3} movies have lots of special features that I think you will enjoy too. These movies have it all, Drama, Suspense & Action. The car chase scenes throughout the trilogy are probably the best I have ever seen. They were really well done. One of the best scenes was in the last movie where that guy was chasing the beautiful {I think} Nicki. The suspense & action was first rate. I really enjoyed these movies & I think you will too.",1353628800,,949,4.272222222222222

If you want a action/thriller with an amazing plot this is it. I looked for a long time to decide which set I wanted to get and this one does not disappoint.

I think that's because I was expecting them to at least resemble the original Ludlum books, but let's face it - these are only ""Bourne"" movies in the sense that there are a few names that are the same, and a couple of similar scenarios.  The plots have almost nothing to do with the original books.  But once I got over that and looked at these movies as a completely independent creation (that just happened to share their names with a book franchise that I love), I was able to really appreciate just how great these movies are.",1349654400,,622,4.344827586206897

3194816,4,B000W07EKW,"These movies are wonderful, but to say that they are based on Robert Ludlum's books is ludicrous.  The only thing these movies have in common with the books of the same names is that many of the characters have the same, or similar names.  There is no commonality of plot, or action, and the movies stray farther from the books as the stories and episodes progress.  Good GAWD, Hollywood!!!

The only way to get out of the ""freeze"" is to unplug your Bluray player.  The other two discs play OK.  I'll now be returning this box set to Amazon and buying each disc separately.  I saw the movies originally in the theaters, and of course, the movies themselves are excellent.  The one star rating is only because one third of this trilogy is defective.

UPDATE: October 1, 2012
This update is to mention that Amazon was extremely prompt in it's superb return process.  I'm still leaving the rating at one star because it's for the item purchased.  I would give five stars to Amazon for their execution of their return policy.",1348531200,6,769,4.521739130434782

3194822,5,B000W07EKW,"I've been a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since it came out in the movie theaters and has revived the spy action thrillers and twists which has become mostly action here and there without much a story to work on. The Bourne Trilogy set comes in nice package fit for 3 discs and basically if you have watched all three films and wanted to know more of the background you will not be disappointed with the set! Here is my review broken into each of the movie included.

The Bourne Identity
The extras included in this disc are great! Even some alternative scenes that are not found on previous DVD releases. This is a must-have for the fans. I won't give any spoilers. Even a psychologist's diagnosis of Jason Bourne!

The Bourne Supremacy
Action sequences are given due credit here and even documentaries. There are extras after the car chase scene in Goa, India and interviews with Matt Damon and Franka Potente.

The Bourne Ultimatum
There are SO MANY extras here! Many documentaries and sections about the film and Robert Ludlum! You'll enjoy this very much!",1347840000,,1056,4.666666666666667

3194826,3,B000W07EKW,"I really like the movies, and the sound track. The audio codec's are great but Bourne Identity does not play on my Sony BDP-590. The Bourne Identity freezes up the machine to the point that I have to unplug it and wait for a few seconds and then plug it back in to get the player unfrozen. The other movies play great, but with this issue I'm going to research and see if there is another release. I don't say if other BD players are having the same issue, but after two sets I'm done for now.

Over all I was really dissapointed that the Bourne Identity stopped at the same place in both box sets, and had to return them both, but I'm giving the set three stars because of the way Amazon handled the issue by issuing a full refund with paid UPS pick up.",1347494400,2,754,4.129251700680272

Colors are crisp, sound is awesome on my surround-sound, & action as filmed is perfect for the big screen; right in my face.

First, I didn't enjoy the last installment (The Bourne Ultimatum) because I was looking for more action, but after watching it again (on DVD) I understand the last movie was to tie up the loose ends and give the audience a better understand of the 'bigger picture' of the character... Well written story line (that I now understand and respect)!  I already have each movie on DVD, so when the Blu-ray Box Set was available I had to buy it!

3194845,5,B000W07EKW,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you will see that I'm not much of a fan of modern films, save aside a few, so keep that in mind, so whats my verdict on these? well as you can see from my review title, I absolutely loved these movies, these are really well done and entertaining, one thing that I really like is that they are not CGI filled movies, it seems like old school cops and robbers, with a little bit of a modern feel with the technology and cell phones and what not, another thing that I like that seems to differ from most modern action movies, is that there is no stupid comedy parts in them, as they are very serious movies, with plots that actually mean something (unlike movies like Transformers and Bad Boys and such), and the 3rd thing I really like is that these movies are really well acted, of course we know that Matt Damon is a terrific actor, so that goes without saying, but the rest of the cast did a great job, especially the woman who plays Pamela Landy, and Julia Stiles is wonderful, and pretty at the same time, so double bonus.

These movies are filled with great action sequences such as hand to hand combat, gun fights, and great car chases, and the suspence just keeps you drawn in, and keeps a hold on you, and keeps your interest, meaning they don't stray off.

Not much more that I can say that everyone else hasn't said already, I watched all 3 of these films in 2 days, and I found all 3 of them to be fantastic, this boxed set is really worth the $20.00 or so dollars you pay, you're getting 3 great movies, plus a bunch of bonus features and the presentation is nice, three slim cases inside of the outer box, that is fine with me, good job Universal, now if only they would put more out like this!",1343606400,,1746,4.224550898203593

I ordered the Trilogy on the 13th and received it today the 16th and that was with the Free Super Saver feature. The Trilogy was only $29.99 so that is $10 apiece and I paid more than that for the DVD's.  I haven't even had time, yet, to see the blu ray's.  I know I will enjoy them since I have a new Samsung Blu Ray 3D player and 42 inch Visio 3d 1080i 240 htz TV, and a new HDMI 7.1 Pioneer amp with Home Theatre Type surround sound speaker system with 200 watt sub woofer---sorry bout that---but I am excited not bragging----well, maybe a little bit.  I don't go out much so I save my money to get a quality Movie experience at home.  Now, If I could only get them to lower the price on the Star Wars Blu Ray extravaganza.  Actually, the DVD's video looks pretty good when they are up-converted.  But, still kind of lacking in the sound department.
The Bourne Identity---the Blu Ray is definitely better than my DVD version (even with the 1080i up-convert.  The Video is clearer, the DTS Sound is Super and the Extras are worth buying the Blu Ray (if for no other reason).  I spent hours last night and I only watched the Extras---picture in picture----and stand alone docs.

only one disk.

Aside from one or two quibbles (why does mr superspy who memorizes every liscense plate in a parking lot at one glance need to have something implanted in his hip to remind him of his bank account?  Just in case he loses his memory?) the movies themselves are wonderful.

Here are the pros and cons of this particular edition of the films:
Pros:
-the blu ray transfer is good, with a fine picture and sound.
-the extras are fun.

Cons:
-These are the single-disk versions of the movies.  No dvd or additional disks such as digital copy.
-At times the picture quality was not as good as I might have hoped.  Still very good, but a bit off.

All in all, highly recommended.  If you like Bourne, you will like this package.  If you like action films, you will love Bourne.

The picture quality in these 3 movies is irregular.  Maybe that was intentional on the part of the film makers but the levels of detail and the color palettes for indoor vs outdoor shots is quite different.  The choices seem to be changing here and there within a movie, and also from one movie to the other. The audio on the other hand is quite punchy in all three disks.  The one drawback in this collection (thus only 4 stars) is that the ""extras"" (deleted scenes, alternate beginnings and endings, etc) are presented in standard definition and they are pretty poor.

3194908,5,B000W07EKW,"This series is really well done and the Blu-Ray only adds to the quality of the films.

(1) The first film is very understated in its action sequences.  Only 1 explosion, completely justified, and a chase scene that rivals any in film history.  To get an idea of the accuracy just watch the sequence when the police officer on the motorbike flips over the car and smacks his helmet.  Every sound is authentic and really adds to the overall product.  I will say that the greatest disappointment in the films is the female lead played by German actress Franka Potente.  Being of German decent and speaking German quite well I can say that she over acted many scenes and was never really a well-developed character.  She just whines throughout the whole movie being surprised by the same issues over and over again and saying scheie every two seconds.

(2) The second film is where it gets a little fuzzy on cinematography, but the story is so sound that you don't mind the seizure inducing camera movements.  Again the action is understated and all reactions seem appropriate.  The opening scene of Bourne and Marie crossing the bridge being chased by a sniper is still my favorite seen (see above for reference).  The new director I think takes the 'sense of action' idea a bit too far, but again the Blu-Ray captures everything in the scenes and the sounds perfectly.

(3) The third and final Matt Damon Bourne movie is a nice combination of the first two films.  The scenes are well thought out and the plot is quite deep and comes to a solid conclusion as to why and how he became the way he is.  You will get a little bit of the blur 'sense of action' junk from the second film but it is much reduced and returns to the actual story.

Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of spy movies.  While Bourne and James Bond are really nothing alike, because of the series success they are constantly compared.  If you like big explosions, gadgets, and amazing vehicles and women keep watching the Bond films I certainly do (Skyfall is Amazing!).  If you like deeper characters, realism, and amazing hand to hand combat then Bourne is for you.  I like them both, but they should be held as exclusive from one another.  I think the Blu-Ray, like most films, is really only needed for cinephiles or audiophiles. So if you are a general movie watcher the normal DVD set should be fine.",1311033600,,2404,4.546511627906977

Identity - meh
Supremacy - didn't score any points
Ultimatum - pulled the rug out from under me
Watched them all again and finally got it - a rare case of both sequels being better than the first movie.

How many action movies do you see in which the protagonist fights using a book, a magazine and a ball-point pen?
Or in which he goes through mayhem just to say sorry to a girl, for killing her parents?
Or in which he looks apologetic after just choking an assassin to death?
Bourne is no Bond...whew.

The guy has no snappy one-liners, no sunglasses, no sharp clothes, no cool gadgets, no fast cars, no techno-weapons, no beautiful women hanging off his arm, and loses his girl by the second act. He has no team to back him up, there are no mega-explosions or bullet-spraying gun battles, and he is not out for revenge or to save the world. Its about a man trying to understand who he is and why he's done the things that he has.

And all this wrapped up in incredible action movies that have the least staged-looking hand-to-hand combat scenes that I have seen (Supremacy and Ultimatum). Fights with no background music, no slow-motion, all the grunting you'd expect during such brawls and the fighters just trying to use what's around them to their best advantage - close to gritty, real-world stuff.

Downsides - some scenes look a little cheesy (Identity), some a little motion-sickness inducing (Ultimatum) and some repetitiveness (all 3).

But somehow I can watch these movies over and over again...and John Powell's music is excellent.
This is simply a unique series in the action movie genre. What else can I say except that Damon as Bourne will be missed - a flawed guy in a sea of modern-day superheroes. He was what he battles now - an assassin. I like that he's so human.",1309737600,2,1829,4.564024390243903

He is Rambo with an IQ. And like all fictional heroes he is the only person in the world who can kill with one shot, while no one else can shoot straight.

I will not comment on the quality of the films, because most people have seen them and you know if you like this type of action movie or not.  I do enjoy these films, and so I wanted a collector's set.  The extras in this set are:
- The box is designed to look like a safe deposit box, and is very nice.
- A passport booklet (the size of a standard dvd box), with a simple and not too impressive design.
- Inside the passport booklet is a bonus disc with a few interview-style documentaries about the legacy of the Bourne series, including archive footage of Robert Ludlum, author of the novels on which the films are based.  The disc has less than an hour of total content, and the material wasn't particularly interesting.

If the above-mentioned exclusives don't interest you, it would be cheaper to buy each of the films separately.  Here are the exact DVD versions that are included in the Jason Bourne Collection:

3194993,4,B000W07EKW,"The Bourne films suffer from the same problem as do the recent Bond offerings - the world has fundamentally changed. The old adversary, the Soviet Union, has gone, and so has the master terrorist Carlos ""the Jackal"", Bourne's protagonist. Therefore, any updating unavoidably means major changes in plot. However, I think the updating has gone rather well, certainly better than the Daniel Craig Bonds.

In cartoons, the characters are completely indestructible. Think of Wil-E-Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. Jason Bourne is the equivalent of an entire Roadrunner cartoon, in that he has Wil-E-Coyote's apparently bottomless pit of ingenuity and finance and his ability to survive complete disaster, combined with Roadrunner's perpetual success in outwitting Wil-E (meep-beep!).

So, given the complete impossibility of the whole enterprise, what makes these films so entertaining? Much of the credit lies with the excellent Matt Damon, who somehow makes into a living, breathing creature the character of Jason Bourne, the killing machine with no past, and, if various nefarious Washington types can help it, no future either. In addition, the one-man-against-the-system drama, especially a system gone bad with a fearsome apparatus and that apparently holds all the cards, is always a good story line - one tends to root fiercely for the little guy. If you want spectacular chases and fight scenes, forget James Bond, this is where it's all at - Bourne's ability to (almost literally) leap tall buildings with a single bound and demolish half-a-dozen armed assailants equipped only with a toothpick (okay, okay, I made that last bit up) is wonderful to behold. The last of the three films is especially good, as a particularly nasty CIA director is constantly outwitted by the ever-versatile and ingenious Bourne, and finally receives his come-uppance.

As I say, all of this is as inherently absurd and cartoonish as Bond or Bauer, but I find it much more entertaining, and I hope that the proposed (and currently stalled) fourth Bourne film goes ahead.",1275350400,,2059,5.290519877675841

The plot in all its continuation is amazing, to say the least! It is in a smooth, constant flow and it brings the viewer into the shoes of Bourne as he tries to fit all the puzzle pieces back together. You cannot help to feel that emotional connection throughout his journey and this is one of the reasons why I am really intrigued. Action, adventure, thrills and twists, character development, and in moments when Bourne is taking a ""rest"" after a heavy chase (For example, when he gets on the train in Supremacy after the hectic chase), you will feel sympathy for him.

** SPOILER ** When Bourne confronts the daughter of his earlier assignments, the mother and father, and tells her that he was the one who killed them (It was believed to be a murder-suicide and the general public believed it), this was and still is the most dramatic scene I will never forget! ** END SPOILER **

The cinematography is well put also. More of a documentary style in the fighting (Awesome choreograph as it looks genuinely authentic) and chase (Cars included, LOL). It might be a bit nauseating from the shakiness to some, but I found it to be most exhilarating.

3195015,5,B000W07EKW,"Being a fan of Ludlum's ""Bourne"" books, I was eagerly anticipating the first film of the series to see how exactly Doug Liman and writer Tony Gilroy were going to adapt the anti-hero to a more modern setting. Taking it from the jungles of Vietnam and the pursuit of Carlos the Jackal, and making it into a high-speed, high-intensity techno-thriller that is quite literally about identity was no small feat. And also making it a really intelligent, extremely well-acted actioner was a task that Liman, Gilroy, and Damon were able to pull off quite well. THE BOURNE IDENTITY set us up for everything that was to come: a very independent attitude brought to the Hollywood style of filmmaking; a great cast of indie players, like Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Clive Owen; a refreshing approach to the immediacy and improvisation of hand-to-hand combat; it's a near-perfect modernization of the tale of Jason Bourne.

THE BOURNE SUPREMACY took that even further. With director Paul Greengrass coming in, who, instead of opting for Liman's more distanced approach to the action which is more appropriate for a Hollywood film, took us directly into the action. With fast cuts, shaky camera shots, and use of sound so that we no longer seem like we're watching the combat, but actually a participant in it, Greengrass (and returning writer Gilroy) sets a slightly different tone, and heightens the intensity that much more. And with the additions of Joan Allen and Karl Urban and Martin Csokas, and keeping Cox, Stiles, Potente and Cooper, Greengrass knows how to do it right. This is most certainly not a film for purists of the Bourne books because this film perhaps has more deviations than the other films from the book's plot points, but it keeps with the main plot, which is the Bourne impostor designed to bring Bourne out in the open. Also Greengrass seems to have more of a handle on bringing a more intense and more personal tale out of the character of Jason Bourne than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.

THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the ultimate icing on the cake of this series, and is quite simply the best film of the series. Greengrass comes back onboard, with Gilroy in tow as well, and they bring actors like Paddy Considine, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and the always-great David Strathairn to round it out. The film is ingenious in many ways, most specifically how it ties this film to SUPREMACY, because scenes that we saw in the previous film reappear in this one in very, very suprising ways. But Greengrass ups the ante once again, and brings Bourne full circle to where it all began. And again, Greengrass never lets up on the viewer for a second once the intrigue and the action and the suspense begin. He lets those moments build to a full boil, and just when you think you can't take it anymore, he goes for the kill.

It's obvious the mark that the BOURNE films have left on the contemporary spy thriller. If you watch the Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, it seems like there are literally entire scenes stolen from the BOURNE films. Unfortunately that didn't help that film. But fortunately, if it can help to reshape the genre of the spy thriller and bring it in a new and more vital direction, with less emphasis on gadgetry and more on character while keeping the globe-trotting action and suspense, then it makes the BOURNE TRILOGY all that much better.",1265500800,,3432,4.716666666666667

3195030,4,B000W07EKW,"For me this is a series that grows on you. When I first watched this series I hated it for its shaky camera work and jarring transitions, then as time goes by I enjoyed it more and more as do most people. The movies are what I call true sequels taking place moments after each film e.g. Back to the Future and The Lord of the Rings are other examples. The movies have an over arching storyline, with the exception of the first because it can stand on it own or with the rest of the series. Now on to a review of each movie.

The Bourne Identity is about a man who wakes up with amnesia and discovers he's a government assassin who failed to pull the trigger. Soon after said government finds out he's alive wants to tie off loose ends and by tie off I mean kill both Bourne and his ally Marie an American traveler who helps in his evasion. The film ends on a happy note with Bourne reuniting with Marie in Greece.

The Bourne Supremacy takes off where the first left off Bourne is with Marie in India and is being hunted by the CIA for a bombing he is framed for. Marie is shot and Bourne is on a quest for revenge and eventually clears his name and the film ends with Bourne going on a crusade to apologize to the families on the people he assassinated.

3195037,5,B000W07EKW,"James Bond is too pampered and spoiled.  Take away his ridiculous gadgets and fancy car, and he would be lost.

Not Jason Bourne.  Bourne relies more on his wit and resourcefulness to make the most with what he has.  Whereas Bond needs a tricked-out Aston Martin with rocket launchers and oil slick dispensers to make it through a car chase, Bourne only needs a beat-up old Cooper Mini.  Whereas Bond sticks out like a sore thumb wherever he goes, Bourne is like your real-life covert operative who does his best to look ordinary, blend in and not attract attention--  You'd never spot him walking through a crowd at a train station.

With the much more intelligent approach that gives up nothing on action, the Bourne trilogy is a refreshing take on the spy genre.

Like Moby says in the Extreme Ways theme for the Bourne trilogy, I would stand in line for this.

The blu-ray discs in this trilogy look absolutely fabulous on my setup (Sony Playstation 3 / Sony Bravia KDL-52W300 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV).  I had rented the standard-definition DVDs from Netflix before I bought the Blu-Ray Bourne Trilogy, and there is absolutely NO comparison--  On a proper setup, blu-ray totally blows away the standard-def DVDs.

3195041,4,B000W07EKW,"Matt Damon *is* Jason Bourne.

I enjoyed these movies tremendously, so I'll just address why it's missing a star.

First, in principle, the box set itself is essentially just a re-release of the existing single DVDs. The only thing you get is the nice case, plus a bonus DVD (the one in the big passport). This didn't bother me, since I never had the individual films. But for someone who already does, it's a big ask to pay for a shiny box and three featurettes.

Second, and with regard to Bourne Identity, the disc itself doesn't exactly match what's on the back of the DVD case. Specifically, the Director's commentary is missing.

FYI: less than a year after this box set came out, Universal re-released (again!) the same three movies, this time without the fancy box or bonus disc, as the ""Bourne Trilogy.""",1254096000,4,812,4.6573426573426575

But I have watched all three movies back to back twice now trying to figure out what all the hype was about and why these films were so hugely successful....and I guess it's the simple excuse for action through some of Europe's most beautiful cities and of course it's always fun to see some hero completely destroy a seemingly invincible system...but my gosh people....IT'S THE SAME MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!! I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!! Yes if you have seen the first movie you have seen them all!!!!

It has plenty of bonus materials for replay value, the physical DVD cases are slim and do not take up much room, and the price is great. It's perfect for someone like me who has not upgraded to blu-ray yet nor wish to pay blu-ray price for the trilogy, which is $72.99 at Amazon as of June 2009.

The picture definitely seemed a little clearer than the DVD's but the sound was incredible. Already good on the DVD version in my home theatre this took it to a new level and I'm not regretting the $65 for upgrading my set. The best thing about it was I have a Sony Blu Ray and a Sony 7:1 AV receiver. Every movie I've played I've had to cycle through my settings to get the best sound. I'm not sure if it was just this movie, my set-up or what but it wouldn't let me change the setting before the movie got started saying it wasn't used. The sound was absolutely perfect so I'm glad it didn't let me mess with it. Motorcylces racing from back left to front right speaker, gun shots echoing and traveling through from front to back. My son and I were laughing at times at how cool the sound was. Visually I use an HD projector that throws a very clear 100 inch picture, I lose a little video quality but this was the best home theatre experience I've had.

3195069,5,B000W07EKW,"""The Bourne Trilogy"" captures each of the three Jason Bourne action thrillers in one package full of first rate action entertainment.  Loosely based on three novels by Robert Ludlum, this trilogy focuses on amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, on the run from mysterious enemies and looking for the key to his missing past.  Matt Damon is absolutely superb in what has become an intensely physical but emotionally understated signature role as Jason Bourne.

""The Bourne Identity"" introduces Jason Bourne as a wounded man found floating in the Mediterranean.  Rescued by a fishing boat, the amnesiac young man is sent on to a bank in Zurich, based on an account number found implanted in a capsule under his skin.  Along the way to Zurich, Bourne discovers he has lethal fighting skills, which become essential to his survival when his appearance at the bank triggers a manhunt by the CIA.  Bourne will have to run for his life, accompanied by an attractive German drifter played by Franka Potente.

In ""The Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne is hiding in India with his girlfriend from the first movie.  He struggles with unclear memories of his life as an assassin.  When Bourne is framed for a murder in Berlin, the CIA and a mysterious Russian oil magnate take up lethal pursuit.  Bourne must return to Europe for a fateful confrontation with his pursuers and with his past.

""The Bourne Ultimatum"" picks up Jason Bourne where the last movie left him, wounded, on the run in Russia, and suffering flashbacks of his indoctrination as an assassin.  A journalist provides a clue to the program that created him and Bourne will race the CIA to his starting point in New York, hounded by fellow CIA assassins.

Joan Allen has a recurring role as a sympathetic CIA official who is a sometime ally in Bourne's quest for his identity.  Julia Styles also has a recurring role as a CIA logistician who figured in Bourne's original assignment.  Top notch casts fill out each of the three stories.  The movies themselves were filmed in a jagged, sometimes grainy, and always fast-moving cinematic style, full of stunts and carried by Jason Bourne's uncanny instincts for coping with any situation.  If the respective plots have a few logic holes, the action moves fast enough through a series of exotic locations to more than distract the viewer.

""The Bourne Trilogy"" is very highly recommended as first rate entertainment for modern fans of the spy genre.",1239408000,5,2445,4.907542579075426

If the movie was not more than 3 stars in my opinion I would not have purchased the Blu Ray. I already have the 3 titles in standard DVD. Could be just my imaginatioin but I think the video quality on the Identity and Supremacy is superior to the Ultimatum in this Blu Ray set. This could be because the Ultimatun on the standard  disc was already of high quality so I do not see an appreciable difference in the Blu Ray.
The Bourne Triology Blu Ray is far far superior to the Godfather Trilogy in Blu Ray. The Bourne Blu Ray trilogy is a good buy and a must have for all Blu Ray 1080p nuts.

My older processor is able to handle the Dolby 5.1 PCM but doesn't decode DTS or DTS HD Master audio.  TV speakers worked via HDMI audio and the player RCA analog out worked - which is how we watched it.  This detail not clear on the Amazon site, but is on the box fine print.

I have to say that I have rented these movies a few times on DVD and enjoyed them every time but the Blu-Ray version brought it up to a whole new level. The packaging is very cool with a magnetically sealed box that opens to reveal the three movies in the standard BD case.

I was a little reluctant to pay +$40 for this version because our Samsung LN52A850 does such a fantastic job of up scaling our DVD's that it is often hard to tell the difference between a DVD and BD. After viewing The Bourne Identity I can tell you that it was well worth the extra money. The picture and sound were amazing and I enjoyed the movie like never before. I will say that the car chase scene was a little too loud for me compared to the rest of the movie and I ended up turning the volume down some for that. I think they could have toned it down some but that might just be me.

The discs come with many extra features like BD live and I have not checked any of that stuff out so I can't provide any feedback on that but I will say they have done a first class job with this release and if you like the movies it is well worth it even if you already have them on DVD.",1233705600,,1243,3.968
3195117,5,B000W07EKW,"It's hard to imagine a better trilogy of films more suitable for Blue Ray than the Jason Bourne movies. Each film looks absolutely fantastic, the sound is spot on, and the films themselves are masterpieces by thriller standards. Bourne has become iconic; the Bond of the new generation. Matt Damon's all-american good looks, intensity, and acting skills give the films a credibility that many movies search for but never find.

There are so many reasons to buy this collection. The transfer quality is nearly perfect in my opinion, but I am not the type to watch the films with a magnifying glass and look for any tiny mistakes. The surround sound is simply unreal. John Powell's score really comes to life and the depth of the sound effects are fantastic. The scene in Ultimatum that takes place in Waterloo Train Station is epic and should go down in cinema history as one of the best cat-and-mouse chase scenes ever made. The storyline is well constructed, believable, and leaves you hungry for more.

Thankfully, there is a fourth Bourne movie in the works, with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass returning to make sure it is done right. I can't wait.

There are few movies I will watch again and again, and these make that very short list. The best trilogy since the GODFATHER movies (sorry STAR WARS fans), these are a no brainer for any movie fan. 5/5 stars.

Movie - 5.0

The first time I ever saw this film series was from a total blind-buy. Previously, I never even wanted to touch it because I had this stupid, unexplainable bias against Matt Damon. To this day, I still can't remember why I had such feelings, but I'm glad I got over it, because The Bourne Trilogy is a masterfully-executed story that has changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. The Bourne Identity starts with the discovery of a man found overboard. He has two gunshot wounds in his back, a Swiss bank account in his hip, and no immediate recollection of who he is. Coincidentally, upon reaching the mainland it seems that he's a master in firearms and fisticuffs when he instinctively disables a couple of poor police officers that just happened to mess with the wrong guy. When he gets to the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport and his name: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). But to his surprise, there's a slew of other passports with the same picture and different names, in addition to lots of cash and even a handgun. Upon setting out to Paris, he meets a woman named Marie (Franka Potente), and the two of them would go on to face assassins and conspiracies while uncovering answers to who he is.

In The Bourne Supremacy, we find the two in Goa living a life of peace after managing to escape pursuit. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. When Kirill attempts to find Bourne and assassinate him, Marie is killed in his stead. And in a rage of anger, Bourne decides to aspire vengeance on all those who had been chasing him. But in the process, he would discover a few more things about his past that would change him for the better.

And in The Bourne Ultimatum, after a British reporter named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) discovers a new Treadstone replacement agency called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), Bourne figures to find the source of Ross' information so he can finally get the answers he'd been searching for, as well as putting an end to these agencies. Upon Ross' assassination, Bourne instills the aid of former Treadstone handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and receives the benefit of the doubt from Pamela Landy as he makes his way back home to New York and discovers the truth to everything he had forgotten.

The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance as even more memories started to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but to many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken).

Video - 5.0

- Video codec: VC-1
- Video resolution: 1080p
- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1, 2.35:1
- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1

The video quality of the series is pretty much perfect aside from the first one. In my initial review a few years ago, I said I wasn't pleased with Identity, but did a pretty crappy job explaining it. After reading up on the technicalities of film-making since then, I've gotten a much better grasp on how to explain and describe these things. That being said, Identity looks very good in terms of black levels, colors, and sharpness. Looking at a lot of the outdoor shots, especially, and a few indoor, the picture retains enough detail that it makes for a pleasant image for the trilogy's initial entry in HD. However, it does suffer from low contrast, giving it a somewhat murky look, and there are several occasions when dirt and a couple of scratches from print damage pop up. It's not terribly distracting, but it is noticeable.

Supremacy, on the other hand, is a major step up. With the changing of director in Paul Greengrass, he gave the image a much more vibrant look that better accentuates all of the aforementioned qualities. Blacks are darker, colors are much more vivid, contrast is better-balanced, and the sharpness is even sharper. Just looking at the beginning scenes in Goa, there's a tremendous amount of color that really adds more life, and the rest of the movie follows accordingly. Some people say the saturation is a little too high, but I'm in the belief that it was intentional since Grengrass is such a visualist. And there's also a good amount of film grain as well, which again, I believe is intentional. So unless you don't like the color timing or are a grain-hater, then those are about the only problems you might have. Finally, Ultimatum has the same kind of photography, only with a difference of intensity. Supremacy ran a little hot in terms of color, but I feel it added to the overall tone of the film itself (Bourne getting hot and angry for revenge, hence the hot look to the picture). However, Ultimatum is essentially where things come full circle and the adventure ends. Because of that, this is probably about as ""normal"" of a color level as you'll get. So there you have it. Aside from the first movie, there's not much else to complain about.

Audio - 5.0

Languages
- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1
- French: DTS 5.1
- Spanish: DTS 5.1

Subtitles
- English SDH, French, Spanish

Again, aside from Identity, the audio is just about perfect. All three movies use the DTS-HD MA codec, and all of them sound fantastic. The only problem with Identity isn't so much the quality, but the quantity. As in the film itself just isn't as heavily-mixed as the others. In his commentary, Doug Liman stressed how he wanted to make Identity a drama first and an action movie second. Because of this, I think it reflects in the sound mix. The actual depth and quality to the track itself is pretty buoyant in terms of separation and directionality and gets especially aggressive during the fight with the first Treadstone agent. Rear speaker activity also gets a really good workout during the car chase sequence when cars start turning the corners. And dynamic range is excellent in the scene where Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character outside the farmhouse.

Additionally, when Greengrass takes over as director for the sequels, the audio gets a tremendous upgrade, just as the video did. Even for as low-key as the opening scenes are in Supremacy, the dynamic depth alone is noticeably louder and more precise. Action sequences offer up even more aggressive mixing such as the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. This scene in particular displays a very exact design that has no music and does a great job isolating its sound effects into the confines of that small, compact area, adding an extra layer of ferocity and tension to it. And the car chase in Moscow towards the end is brimming with activity as the vehicles skid, crash, and break all over the place. But even still, Ultimatum manages to top that. Immersion is outstanding from the crowd noise for the scene at Waterloo Station, isolation is more intense in the fight between Bourne and Desh, and the car chase in New York is a sonic masterpiece of mayhem and music. By the way, John Powell's score is another big factor to the overall sound of these films. His string and percussion works really help to compliment the storytelling that even exudes a subtle amount of LFEs through his awesome drum pieces. Outside from the one minor issue with Identity, all of these films sound superb.

Extras - 4.0

There are quite a bit of extras, but if I were to highlight just one feature from each movie, I'd say at the very least(!) give the audio commentaries a listen. And if you like technical stuff, the U-Control Picture in Picture for Supremacy is well-worth a watch as well.

So there you have it. If you've read my individual reviews for these movies, there's not much else I can say. The Bourne Trilogy is one of the best in its genre, and I'm really thankful for its influence in a lot of other recent entries (the Daniel Craig Bond movies and Liam Neeson's roles in both Taken and Unknown). It refreshed the genre with a mix of mystery, grit, and emotional depth that has really raised the standard. This box set is a very good deal, and I'm glad I made that blind-buy when I did. The A/V specs are essentially perfect outside of the first film, and they're all chock full of meaningful special features. If you haven't seen these films yet, make the time.

3195126,4,B000W07EKW,"The sad truth is, I only got into this whole Bourne craze last year...I didn't even see Ultimatum! Of course, my cousin thought that was absolutely crazy so she forced me into having a Bourne marathon with her.

And I absolutely, positively, LOVED it. And when I absolutely LOVE something, I HAVE to buy it.

It's a real treat to be able to have all three movies together in a little set you can pick up and watch whenever you like. All the original extras for each movie are included so that's a bonus.

But why only four star? Well, I was slightly disappointed with the packaging of this boxset. For those who were wondering, there are no ""bonus"" features for this boxset - it's basically a hard paper case with three slim DVD cases, each containing one disc, which has the widescreen version of the movie with extras. As one reviewer previously mentioned, if you're looking for posters, cards etc., this won't satisfy you.

The only thing I'm worried about is...what am I gonna do when the fourth Bourne movie comes out on DVD? Will they release another boxset? Will my love for Bourne make me buy that one too? Haha, we shall see...",1232496000,14,1136,4.5268292682926825
3195127,5,B000W07EKW,"Great Buy!

Bourne kicks Bond Butt..!! This a good value dvd pack, with 3 excellent films written as a trilogy. The filming is top notch and adds to the sense of realism. Matt Damon does most of his own stunts and fighting scenes which makes it all actually really believable - there are practically no outrageous ""Bond"" moments which are simply not possible in the real world...

The 2nd film isn't quite as intense but the 3rd is a non-stop thrill ride. Look out for the part of the film in Morocco for some serious heart pounding action...... It's not necessarily about the action but the stress of him being caught that makes this a fantastic film which is so rare for the 3rd in a series.

The Blu Ray version recently released which would be an obvious buy if money is not an issue but this version has loads of extras to keep you happy and you'll be drawn to watch if over a few times to catch all the little subtle plot lines.. Awesome!",1231977600,,944,4.3522727272727275

3195171,5,B000W07EKW,"I have seen a lot of spy films.  For suspense, mystery, complexity that the viewer must unravel, and that strange quality that allows you to suspend your disbelief, this is undoubtedly the best trilogy of spydom I have ever seen.

You start with Bourne waking with amnesia, struggling to remember who he is, but with his calculating mind and deadly skills wired into his DNA.  He is in danger and meets a wonderful girl, who is kind of a lost soul with great potential, that life force that one finds in sudden, true love.  She becomes his guide to the search for - or effort to reconstruct - his personality.

Due to politics and a murderous bureaucracy, Bourne functioned as a kind of ultimate assassin.  (""I don't send you to kill...I send you to be invisible because you don't exist."")  Over the course of 3 films, we learn details of what he was made to be, and how.  At the end, we see that he hated what he had become, which in combination with his ""conditioning"", was the source of his amnesia.  It was psychological - wanting to find his earlier identity, which was taken from him in spite of his protests - as much as physical.

His new life, of course, is tragic.  This makes it psychologically real, combined with the greatest acting that I have ever been found in a spy series.  In my view, Damon is one of the greatest actors alive, and he gives life to this role in a way I have never seen in a spy film.  The most interesting things is that each film in the series adds to the others, deepening the themes while offering heart-pounding suspense and sufficient realism and detail to enter the imagination.  Yet not everything is explained, so that many of the biggest conclusions lie under the surface.

If I could give this series 6 stars I would.  I have watched each film numerous times and am never disappointed - it just gets richer.  This is one of the rare films that transcends the book.",1206316800,,1910,4.45821325648415

3195201,4,B000W07EKW,"In 2002, we were made privy to the world of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), a man with no memory who found he had a knack for all things espionage. As he tried to find himself, he fell in love and ended with the woman of his non-existent dreams.

In 2004, Bourne returned and his love was killed before his eyes. It seems someone framed him for a theft and the CIA is out to get him once and for all. Having warned them he would retaliate, he fulfills his promise.

Now it's 2007 and there is more to the story of Jason Bourne, aka David Webb. Bourne is on the trail of the CIA still, hoping to find out more about his past and why he can't remember a thing.

When Bourne resurfaces and contacts a news reporter who may have information for him, the reporter is killed and the hunt for Bourne begins anew. But one thing that these CIA officials seem to never learn is that just who is hunting who is a question that should have been asked long ago.

The head of the CIA (Scott Glenn) brings in NSA member Noah Vossen (David Strathairn) and Pam Landy (Joan Allen) to use the full resources on hand to find Bourne. At the same time, they are trying to track down the link that contacted the reporter. An attempt to tie up what they consider loose ends results in more death and more reason for Bourne to tie up loose ends of his own. A solution needs to be found and Bourne will find it.

Damon does an awesome job of making the difficult seem easy. The fight sequences are top of the line, fast moving and totally believable. His acting comes through as well, never resorting to action and nothing else. You believe that his is a troubled mind that will pull out all the stops to solve the mystery.

Now, for fans of the series of films there is a must have on sale. THE JASON BOURNE COLLECTION is a box set with perks galore. Not only that, they've gone creative on the packaging, making the box look like a security box from a bank, a crucial element to the story.

All three films are included in the set, all done to look as sharp and clear as possible. As well as the films and their own special features, there is another disc packaged in what appears to be a passport. This disc contains features about author Robert Ludlum, the creation of the Bourne character, a look at the success of the series and original trailers for all three films.

For thriller fans, for spy fans, for Ludlum fans and especially for Bourne fans, this is the set that they'll want to see under their Christmas tree. And for all that you get, it's well worth the expense. Bourne is back in a big way.",1200700800,,2577,4.25562372188139

The Bourne series is extremely good; lots of action, plot twists, and a vulnerable yet strong hero.  The movies mesh well and the supporting characters are well cast.  I try to only purchase movies that I know I will enjoy watching many times. Since HD DVD is new and I do not know who will win the HD wars (HD DVD vs BLU RAY) I am especially careful about HD DVD purchases.

Watching all three on 1080p was well worth the price of admission. Bonus Features of HD-DVD discs are good extras not found on the regular discs.

I wish the discs came in an official sleeve that binds all three together, but they came as separate discs. A good buy!!",1200614400,,526,4.198019801980198

Perhaps you should be more specific in your descriptions of the items, as we weren't able to watch the first two movies.

The bonus disc is just 3 interview type shorts. I would have rather gone with the bestbuy exclusive edition which is supposed to have a metal case and bonus features that sound more interesting. This is a good set if you don't already have the movies, but the bonus disc is just a bonus disc and nothing special or something to look forward to.

3195256,5,B000W07EKW,"The general trend is that by the 3rd installment everyone has lost interest, from the actors to the audience (just go and watch Pirates OTC 3). Not so with the Bourne series. I think the difference is that they kept it to the point. These are action films and only action films. Very little of any thing else crept in. Romance was kept to the first one, instead of a new conquest for each. No comic relief. Just good old fashioned none stop action. In fact if you have a heart problem the fight scene with the reporter, in Ultimatum, might do you in. ;-)

It was also nice that the was very little cursing and nothing explicit in the sexual arena, just implied in the first movie only and the violence was not unnecessarily graphic. I could watch it with my teens comfortably.

The set was also put together nicely, the bank deposit DVD case and passport were nice touches.

3195270,4,B000W07EKW,"Five years after the first in the Bourne Trilogy, came the last in the trilogy. So it was then that I decided to sit down with all three for my first look at each.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Supremacy/dp/B0002ZDVEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Supremacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B000VWYJ86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>&nbsp;all tie together nicely. Is it necessary to view them chronologically to comprehend what's going on? Probably not. Does it help? Most definitely. So this collection is perfect for anyone like me that has never seen the first two of the three films.

Writer Tony Gilroy adapted all three films to the screen from three Robert Ludlum novels of the same name. Identity has a different (little known) director than the (little known) director of Supremacy and Ultimatum...but you'd never know it; all three are as hectically paced with fight and chase scenes that will blow viewers out of their chairs. So kudos to Gilroy for putting together 3 scripts that each director could easily translate onto film.

Getting chased is the story of Jason Bourne's life. Fighting those who dare to chase him is Jason Bourne's game. Bourne is a government agent with an 'identity' crisis. And if there was ever a guy who could say, ""the world is out to get me,"" and mean it, it's him. These three action-packed movies will keep you on the edge of (if not knock you off of) your seat for a good 6 hours.

Great entertainment in one package for viewing at your convenience. Buy it up.",1199404800,,1818,6.117647058823529

One other thing, this set got a few 1's from buyers that bought this and don't have a HD DVD player. If you don't have a HD DVD Player don't buy this, it won't play.

The movies are stunning and better than being in a moviehouse if you got a 5.1 and you can watch all the extras in each.

Seriously, it's a waste of time.  Just buy them separately.  This is so much to the point that each individually wrapped movie has tape on them where the security tag would usually go.

The movies are THE BEST...but don't be fooled by this packaging.  And the bonus material is a COMPLETE let down.  There is so much they could have done...instead we get a documentary of the writer.

3195290,5,B000W07EKW,"Wow! These 3 films are just terrific! I read the first Ludlum novel (IDENTITY) in 1980, and I've been an avid fan ever since. The 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain was pretty good, but then came these 3 films, and now, for me, Matt Damon simply *is* Jason Bourne. This package has all 3 Bourne movies+extras in a ""Swiss bank account"" box, complete with a cool mock-passport that has a special extra inside--a 4th disc with a nice bio of Robert Ludlum. And the silver box looks great on my DVD shelf. I'm 50+, but I feel like a kid again.

As for the 3 movies themselves, what can I say that hasn't already been said? They're great. Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass are fine directors, and they seem to be inventing a new way to film action thrillers. The cast is first-rate, and the action sequences are among the best ever staged. The scripts have cleverly updated the original novels to reflect current events, and there's just the right somber, serious tone to them, especially regarding the central character's search for answers about his former life. There's been a lot of argument about the lightning-paced editing and the naturalistic lighting and the hand-held cameras, but I think these elements give the films their sharp edge and constant sense of immediacy. And Damon's portrait of the tormented hero is one for the books. Any way you look at it, the Bourne trilogy is incredibly intelligent, entertaining, state-of-the-art filmmaking. (And you'll love the cool packaging, too!) Highly recommended.",1197590400,6,1519,4.887596899224806

3195293,5,B000W07EKW,"The Bourne trilogy is an action packed, no-nonsense, saga that follows the protagonist, Jason Bourne, on a whirlwind adventure across the world. Strangely, he is simultaneously fighting to find who he is and running from the secrets he unburies. These movies put you in the grit and chaos of a post-Cold War spy game that plays out in some of the most thrilling locales in the world. The characters are relentless and, unlike other spy movies, the imperative behind their actions will strike a nerve with even the most callous movie-goer. The movies are not about grand schemes to overthrow the existing regime. Rather, they are about survival, finding out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and if there really is a difference. The confusion and chaos of clandestine ops is clearly exaggerated, but it also never felt so good.",1196812800,9,840,4.8
3195294,4,B000W07EKW,"I will start this with saying I HATED Live Free or Die Hard in the theater.. when I watched it s second timr.. I realized.. there was a bit, not much bit a bit more to it.. the whole Justin Long character being the lens of which we see the chaos the world is thrown in..

NOW.. relating to Bourne. Yes.. there were those long sequences of action.. with car crashes and chases.. that seemed inexplicable, almost.. BUT comparing it to a mindless action flick, like Die Hard 4 for example.. where the good guy has been shot.. bleeding is now driving a trailor tractor rig being shot out by missiles from an F-35 with the bridge he's on exploding RIGHT behind him.. as he jumps off the bright RIGHT before...

OK.. Bourne has always been about the action.. that's true.. It is by and far an ACTION film. BUT I also agree with a previous poster. In the first film we are stuck with Bourne.. trying to figure out WHO he is.. which follows through all three films ending in an almost CRUSHING revelation in the third film.. In which Bourne really blames eevryone for what he becomes *SPOILER* ultimately Bourne must find.. he has to blame himself. *SPOILER*

BUT.. the big thing really is.. that Bourne was from the beginning like most action heroes.. a reluctant one.. and still is.. unlike Rambo who would lay down the mantle for piece.. but be roused back into it. Bourne would have been content trying to piece himself together and stay a quiet anonymous existence living in India.. or wherever he wants.. without the gunplay and the killing.. these were never something that felt missing from him.. unlike Rambo who would never truly be himself without being through some.. torture or fight. Granted in some of the films.. we see some depth to Rambo, mostly through his end monologues (although there is a fantastic quiet scene in part II on a river boat, I am sure most Rambo fans know it). Bourne, on the other hand.. isn't that. He's very reluctant.. and sorrowful. Realizing what he was.. and.. trying for a quiet moment to atone for the wrong he has done.

This is what has really made Bourne something very different, unique and special in the action field. Granted.. he's part MacGyver.. and unstoppable when he wants to be.. but he's also one who can fight tooth and nail.. and then feel the depth of the wrongs he's done.

Ultimatum is a very odd film.. technically a PREQUEL (yeah it threw me off as well going in) AND a sequel rolled into one. Bourne finally discovers what he was.. and who he is. a very satisfying wrapup to the series.. unlike a previous reviewer, I can only say the Bourne series has gotten BETTER with each successive installment. And if there'a a fourth, I hope its great.. but if there isn't.. then that's ok too.. this is an END.. and a good one at that.",1195862400,2,2787,4.521825396825397

Still, the movies are great, probably the greatest spy films since 007.  There's not a weakpoint in the trilogy, and I loved the way it ended; a coda to the way it began, underwater.  Damon is pretty convincing, doing a lot of his own stunts so you can see his face close-up during chase scenes.  I also like the implied former romance with Julia Styles hinted at in Ultimatum.
