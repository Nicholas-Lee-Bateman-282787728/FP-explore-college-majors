2028346,4,B0001US6DW,"This is not a well known film but it is one that I recommend to the John Wayne film buff.  Also, those who think Wayne was just another cowboy star should watch this.  It is a snapshot into the mid 1930's.  The Dust Bowl is in evidence as well as refugees from the Nazis in Europe.  Wayne is the leader of a town that takes in a medical doctor who has fled Europe.  The conditions in the Dust Bowl makes the population of the town refugees as they pull up stakes and head to Oregon.  Add in subplots of romance with the doctor's daughter and interference from a Nazi former boyfriend and you get the idea.",1172966400,5,605,4.172413793103448
2028347,3,B0001US6DW,I thought the movie was an insight into the time.  It was made either prewar or early world war II  and showed good versus evil.  I like movies that show a clear difference between right and wrong and this one did just that.,1152403200,5,224,4.162790697674419
2028348,3,B0001US6DW,"Why on earth did they make this film??? It`s rather short on entertainment value u c - dear reader. However; as a study of mileue and character it survives.. if only just....  Some scenes with John and Sigrid(they did have an affair hehehe)are potent indeed, but they could have made so much MOOOOOOOOORE of it... It`s sad really....",1103500800,3,333,4.741379310344827
2028349,4,B0001US6DW,"So far, the Republic films of John Wayne that have made it's way onto DVD have been hit or miss, when it comes to how nicely they get transferred.  Some, like ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" and ""The Quiet Man"" appear to be transferred from a poor VHS source.  Others, like ""Wake Of The Red Witch"" or ""King Of The Pecos"" look to come from the original film elements.  So, needless to say, I was wondering how ""Three Faces West"" would look, when it showed up on my doorstep.  I'm happy to say it looks great!  It has some age-related problems, like a few ""pops"" and ""ticks"" in the soundtrack, but that's to be excused...seeing as a film like this would never get the full restoration process.
As for the film itself, it's a quick moving take on the dust bowl farmers of the 1930s, and their trek to a new land in Oregon.  Many compare this film (unfairly) to John Ford's ""The Grapes Of Wrath"", seeing as both deal with the same subject matter.  While John Ford's film was made to make a statement about the plight of the mid-western farmers, this was made to be mostly just an 80 minute action film for John Wayne.  And for that purpose, it succeeds!  Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed....",1085788800,33,1192,4.406392694063927

8016700,4,B0001US6DW,"This excellent movie was made a year after John Wayne's breakout role in ""Stagecoach"" and was not Wayne's last film for Republic Pictures..., ""The Quiet Man"", for example, was a Republic production. Although Republic produced many B-movie, ""poverty row"", Westerns - primarily in the thirties with Wayne starring in many - this is not one of them. It has excellent A-list production values. It is an unusual Western, in that it takes place during the Dust Bowl era on our Great Plains and the Nazi era in Europe. Charles Coburn, in an excellent role for him, plays a refugee medical doctor from Nazi Austria, who emigrates with his daughter, played by Norwegian-American, Sigrid Gurie, the Siren of the Fjords. Wayne has a relatively complex part as the leader of a North Dakota dust-bowl town, who invites Coburn to become the town doctor. Wayne, of course falls in love with Gurie and vice versa, but she has a prior engagement to an Austrian doctor, who was thought to have been killed by the Nazis, but turns up alive. All efforts to save the dust-bowl ranches and farms fail and Wayne leads a ""wagon train"" of old jalopies to Oregon, where land is being made available under Roosevelt's New Deal. Gurie and Coburn discover, after meeting w/the doctor she's engaged to, that he has converted to Nazism...so she is free to marry Wayne. Good acting by the entire cast, although Coburn forgets that he's supposed to have a German accent from time to time. The dust-bowl refugees also get their geography a bit mixed up too, as they head north from North Dakota to Oregon, instead of west. Other than those minor flaws, this is a fine movie and an excellent example of Wayne's early work. Highly recommended.",1365120000,,1707,4.77027027027027

8016702,5,B0001US6DW,John Wayne is the leader of a bunch of Kansas farmers in the dust bowl who try to save there farmers but all the top soil is gone so they decide to move to Oregon.  They face problems with one of the farmers who wants to be the leader and take the folks to California instead.  He takes over and then steals the groups money and leaves but John Wayne chases him down and then leads them on to Oregon and wonderful land.  The case was pretty damages when the movie arrived but I had an extra case so that was no problem.  The movie itself was in excellent condition.  Thanks  RWM,1292025600,,578,4.116071428571429
