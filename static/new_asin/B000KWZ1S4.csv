2697898,4,B000KWZ1S4,"Being involved in the making of the film (I had a supporting role as Dr,. McCarthy,)  I had firsthand knowledge of the hard work and persistance of everyone involved.  That being said, I was floored when I actually saw it at the Seattle screening.  Although there were gaps in the story, it looked and played better that I had imagined.  I was unaware of all the fun and surprises that kept me glued to my seat.  My hats off to Writer/Director Rick Valantine, Alison McBryde for her excellent casting, Levon for his cinematography and the entire cast & crew.  Good Work",1170633600,6,569,4.584158415841584
2697899,4,B000KWZ1S4,"I must confess, I had viewed this film at several stages

before its completion. And now, after seeing the finished DVD, I'm happily surprised to see how well it turned out.

The girls (and guys) are beautiful! The acting is good. The Special Effects add a lot too.

The story is a bit lacking, but what horror

film today isn't? The film is written and directed by

the same and in my opinion, it shows. The surprise

comes at the end which I'm not going to give away, but

I will say, the 'behind the scenes' gives you a

hilarious glimpse into how it was made.  All in all, I

suggest this film for a date-night flick or at least

grab a friend when you watch it because it will make

you want to leave the lights on!",1168992000,6,720,4.13768115942029
8159321,1,B000KWZ1S4,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  I am a movie ""fanatic"" and I must tell you that after only 20 minutes, I removed the movie from my DVD player and went back to watching a Lifetime movie.  I am still searching for the right movie.  I know there are several, all different types, but I will continue to search until I find the right one.",1515542400,,347,4.2272727272727275
8159322,5,B000KWZ1S4,Bloody Mary is your classic b-horror movie. Though the acting is not great it is fun to watch if you like horror. Two things to keep in mind. You will see several women show their boobs and the late Cory Monteith showed his fine butt. The kills are innovative and it has a nice twist ending. If you love glee buy this dvd.,1445299200,,322,4.126984126984127

8159324,2,B000KWZ1S4,"I'm a huge fan of indie horror.  Yeah, you have to mill through two tons of dirt to find one itty-bitty gem, but half the fun is the search, right?

I gave this film a chance finding it on a compilation disc, and having seen (and being greatly disappointed in) ""The Legend of Bloody Mary"", I was curious to what kind of view another group of filmmakers might have.

Well, here's to more dirt:(

Whereas the acting in this movie wasn't AWFUL, it left a lot to be desired, but I could live with that.  As another reviewer pointed out, I was put off by the lackadaisical portrayal of the mental hospital policies, or perhaps I should say the LACK of them...but I could live with THAT.  There was both male and female nudity, both of which lingered longer than was really necessary for the advancement of the plot, but I could live with THAT. The plot wasn't terribly original, but it DID have ambition, and under different circumstances could quite likely have had potential.

However...

What killed this film for me, without giving it all away, are the gaping holes in the story that the filmmakers either simply forgot about, thought they did a good enough job of leaving clues for the viewer to deduce the answers (they did NOT), or simply thought it would be clever to have the ambiance of a lot of ""unknowns"".

None of the above were acceptable in my opinion.

Spoiler free, I'll just say there are three GLARING plot points that absolutely no explanation or revelations are given for.  It's as though we're supposed to already know what's going on...whereas I suppose the argument can be made that it gives the movie 'mystique', in this instance it simply leaves you wondering what the hell you've just watched.

Oh, and the scene where you hear the gun fire but there's no flash, no smoke, no slide, and no spent shell casings...what, blanks were too expensive?

I wouldn't bother with this one, fans.  Maybe someday, someone will give us an intelligent and scary Bloody Mary film, but for now, we wait.",1285804800,3,2008,4.603932584269663
8159325,1,B000KWZ1S4,"Don't waste your time or your money!!! The only thing that was HORROR in this movie was...HORRIBLE acting, HORRIBLE script, HORRIBLE special effects, HORRIBLE everything!!! I would've rated this movie minus 10 stars...but it wouldn't let me.",1283817600,,241,5.54054054054054
8159326,1,B000KWZ1S4,"i only bought this dvd because i like Corey Montieth who co-stars on the popular
t.v. series GLEE. i thought it would be nice to see some earlier work of his.

Bloody Mary has got to be the worst and i mean ***THE WORST*** horror film ever
made. the production values look like the budget was [...]. the only reason and i
mean ***THE ONLY*** reason to see this film is to get a rather nice glimpse of
Corey's naked butt which i doubt you'll ever see on GLEE.",1274745600,,458,4.146067415730337
8159327,1,B000KWZ1S4,"This had to be one of the smallest budgets ever for a movie. The low quality got on my last nerve like nails on a chalkboard and there wasn't one decent actor in this film.

The plot could have been workable if not for the pitiful hand wad of cash used to finance this movie. Honestly... stay away from this one, unless your one of those people who enjoys wasting your time on low budget flicks that are a complete waste of film and time.",1257033600,,438,4.152941176470589
8159328,2,B000KWZ1S4,"This was a horrible movie and you really shouldn't waste your money, this movie was garbage. In the leagend of bloody mary you have to call for her, this movie takes away from the story that been told for generations. Trust me when I tell you, I love scary movies, there the best type of movies to watch if you ask me and this so called scary movie didn't do it for me. Don't waste your money......This was horrible!!!",1188864000,,418,4.30379746835443
8159329,3,B000KWZ1S4,"There are many plain movies using Bloody Mary as story-lines, this one is just one of them, but to a horror fan like me, this movie looks like an 90's, and a bit boring...",1179014400,2,171,4.0588235294117645
8159330,3,B000KWZ1S4,"I read the reviews here and was intrigued by this film, so I gave it a chance. With minimal budget, I think the film was really well done. Some of the scripting and acting is amateurish, but it at least remains consistent. I might be knit-picking a bit here, but the part that really irked me the most were the scenes in the mental hospital. Mostly the doctors, who obviously have never worked in a hospital, or know any of the rules that govern such an institute. First, the main character, Natalie (Kim Tyler) is able to walk on the property and visit patients who have no relationship to her. This is definately against policy in that they need consent from the patient. Next she brings in a gift (a teddy bear) which is also not allowed to give gifts unless inspected and approved by the hospital. She ends up giving it to some other patient. Natalie would probably not be allowed back to that hospital because of that. Most of the patients are typical ""crazies"" who are free to walk around, which would not be the case either. Not to mention they walk freely around Natalie with no observation from the mental health workers. The conversation with the two head doctors and Natalie would never have happened, and even if it did, they would not have had that conversation revealing so much about a patient. Although the head doctor mentions ""patient confidentiality"", he continues at length discussing the patient who has no relevance to Natalie's life (save for her detective work, but thats only for the stories sake). He also says they don't know whats wrong with her and it would be too early to make any kind of diagnosis. This is what really threw me. If they had no diagnosis, the patient would not be in the hospital. With health care insurance knee deep in hospital policy, a diagnosis is mandated before any insurance can be given, thus any treatment. So, in sum, the hospital setting is that of a pre-war era with some knowledge of the modern hospital routine, so it comes off as ignorant.

Otherwise the film, as a horror movie does its job with some decent scares, good gore, lots of attractive girls running around, nude at times, which makes for a relatively solid horror film.",1176854400,5,2195,4.6138107416879794
