8150921,4,B000JJO10M,"This is an amazing documentary. While only 26 minutes in length, it captures the essence of Rodin's art better than any other one I have yet seen. It does a great job of narration and voice over using Rodin's quotes and the low budget hand held production actually enhances the emotional effect of the artwork.

Sadly, this is a poor quality DVD clearly just copied of a VHS tape and has some hick-ups during playback. But you have to be glad that somebody saved this film from extinction.",1341619200,3,489,4.556818181818182
