8010344,5,B0001DCBYE,I remember when I was a kid when this show and toy line dropped. I had a few of the basic toys but I still had fun acting out my own adventures and seeing all my favorite dinosaurs decked out in armor and laser weapons. Totally epic!,1498608000,,233,3.978723404255319
8010345,5,B0001DCBYE,I first saw this show on a tape my dad had recorded off the TV. After many years of being stored in his closet and us watching it every now and then the tape became unusable. Many years passed by and i regained interest in this show and saw it had not seen an official release on DVD so i settled for this tape. Hopefully Shout Factory picks up the license for this show and releases every episode on DVD and interviews the original voice actors. Great Sci-Fi action cartoon show for its time even though it was just a promotional tool for the Dino Riders toys made by Tyco.,1461283200,,574,4.2272727272727275

Just like the STEP crystal transported the Valorians and Rulons back in time, this video will transport you back to your childhood. You can practically taste the Captain Crunch.",1388361600,2,278,4.56
