7919061,3,B00003M5GL,"When the title said ""Legends,"" I thought they meant like the Odyssey, King Arthur's Court, Star Wars, or stuff like that.  They actually mean famous men, such as Braveheart, Rob Roy, etc.  It's ""legend"" in that historical accounts are scarce or of questionable authenticity.

Does the word ""Scottsophilia"" exist?  I really think this work was made for people who love or are fascinated by that land.  Lots of the actors are redhead.  The interviewees have thick Scottish accents.  There are kilts all over the place.  The views are almost entirely of verdant, tall hills.  I can't tell if this work was made for Scots or for viewers of Scottish descent outside the British Isles.  They don't mention haggis, but they might as well have given their goals.

Because this work is a mix of video and film, I'm thinking they took scenes from real movies and also made reenactments.  In the same way that many of us Americans like reenacting the Civil War, you can tell these Scots just loved imitating their ancestors.  The actor portraying Braveheart didn't have two braids near his ears as the statue and Mel Gibson does/did.  All the interviewees are male perhaps purposefully paralleling that all the legends were male.  There was no mention of a Scottish Boudicaa here.",1205539200,3,1269,4.864485981308412
7919062,5,B00003M5GL,"Scottish historians discuss five legendary figures from Scottish history -- William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, James IV, Rob Roy, and Bonnie Prince Charlie -- documentary interview and tour guide style, making very abundant use of good footage from recent British movies about these men, plus some very fine scenery photography.  Significant emphasis on the major battles they each fought (Falkirk, Bannockburn, Flodden, Culloden).  The historians are good, and get all the facts straight and in sensible context in way readily understandable for those new to the topic and yet still interesting to those familiar with the subject, if only because the experts' accents are so genuine and delightful.  The sound quality was very good (unlike many British productions).  50 minutes long, enjoyable the whole time.  I'm getting copies for friends.",984355200,10,844,5.461538461538462
