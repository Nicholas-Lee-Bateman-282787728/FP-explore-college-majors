(...) These are both very funny Simpons episodes. Bart getting hit by Mr. Burns is one of the best episodes in the series.  It introduces (...), (Dr. Nick) and Lionel Hutz (""There's THE TRUTH and then there's the truth!"")who went on to appear in many more episodes.  (...) The episode also shows just what an ogre, Mr. Burns is.
The second episode on the tape when Homer eats the blowfish, has lots of very original gags, and is also very funny. Homer gets the brochure, ""So, you're going to die"" from his doctor.  He comes into the examination room only to see Marge who has just consulted with the Doctor, looking very sad, and he says because he can read her like a book, it must be GOOD NEWS!.  (...)  Go for it.
Bye, everybody!",1008115200,2,746,4.416058394160584

If I were to buy it, it would be only if it were my fav episode, otherwise I would get  it in a pack with other videos.",946857600,,253,3.9019607843137254
