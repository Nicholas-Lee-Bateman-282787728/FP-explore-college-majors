8184602,5,B000OCZ2Q6,"I absolutly LOVE this anime! I've seen alot of the Japanese eps but it takes so long to sub them. I was really excited when I heard that it was being relesed in the US. BUT!!!! For some reason the 3rd one didn't come out when it was suposed to....they say that it's because Genon is goin bankrupt or somethin. I hope not, but it sure looks that way.",1204761600,3,349,4.072463768115942
8184603,1,B000OCZ2Q6,"Don't buy from Geneon/Pioneer! It's a waste of time and money! You won't get the rest of the season/series from them! Find yourself an Import sorce. It maybe a sub but atleast you'll get the whole season/series.

Rightstuf (Geneon's rep. in the U.S.) has removed the series from their lists. You won't get them there of here.",1194393600,7,325,4.701754385964913
8184604,4,B000OCZ2Q6,"In the second instalment of S.O., the story begins to unfold.  Masahiro starts to tap into his hidden powers and Gouren's past with Masahiro's grandfather is hinted at. The animation for this is decent and the story isn't anything out of this world, but the plot is interesting and it really flows neatly. This has, of course, romance, so there is also the story of Masahiro and the princess, which takes a twist in this dvd since she is about to be married off to someone else in the royal court. Overall, a well rounded series with no mayor surprises, although it will not awe you, it will entertain and amuse you.",1191024000,4,616,4.5
