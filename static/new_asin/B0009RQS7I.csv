2317165,5,B0009RQS7I,"This series is definitely not for every taste -- many will find it just plain bizarre -- but it's absolutely one of the most interesting bits of anime out there.  The art is wonderful and extremely consistent, the pacing is solid, and the characters are certainly memorable.  While the DVD's are a bit light with regard to ""extras,"" the interface is always excellent and unique to each disc.

If you are a serious fan of anime, you'll want to check this out.",1124755200,3,458,4.560975609756097

I felt that the first few discs were stronger than the last two. I did especially like the ""preview"" at the end of the last episode. To say anymore would give away the enjoyment. I highly recommend also Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress by Kon as well.",1122249600,18,377,4.478260869565218

2317168,5,B0009RQS7I,"An anime from Satoshi Kon, who wrote and designed ""Tokyo Godfathers"", Paranoia Agent offers a dark, chilling, and complex story about people pushed to their breaking point and a phantom who may become an urban legend.

To begin with, there is Tsukiko Sagi, designer of the popular Mamori dolls.  But her success has cost her dearly - she is isolated by jealous rivals at work, she's under pressure to create a new doll, and she seems to have lost all her creative spark.  Then, out of nowhere, she becomes the first victim of the boy they call the Shonen Bat, or Lil Slugger.  But was she really attacked, or did she injure herself out of desperation?  And why has her Mamori doll begun to talk to her?  Is she losing her mind?

The stories get more and more involved from there as Lil Slugger's list of victims continues to grow.  A reporter, a schoolboy and his rival for class president, a tutor, a corrupt police officer and his daughter...and all the connections the cops think they can draw turn out to be dead ends.  And just when they think they've got Lil Slugger behind bars, the REAL Lil Slugger appears...

So who or what is the Shonen Bat?  All anyone knows is that he's a boy with a golden bat.  He may be one man or two men.  He can appear before anyone, at any time, but he comes for those who have been cornered, with no way out.  And he's still on the loose!

The series features well-written stories and interesting characters with excellent character designs.  If you're a fan of dark, complex, thought-provoking anime such as Witch Hunter Robin, Wolf's Rain, or Noir, or if you're just a fan of urban legends, you should definitely give this series a chance.  But the kiddies should definitely stick to Dragonball Z and Cowboy Bebop...this series will be way over their heads.",1121385600,15,1797,4.548286604361371

2317184,5,B0009RQS7I,"i only recently rediscovered satoshi kon's 'paranoia agent', having glanced at it on adult swim in its day.  the credits caught my attention, but i drifted out during the episode, not having enough context via previous eps to draw me in.  that has been rectified by youtube and this dvd set i (holy cow!) lucked into finding.  the adult swim episodes were in english, but i find the japanese VAs to be more expressive and the subtitles to be scannable.  the plot seems to be linear thru the first half of the series, but theme assumes dominance until the last couple of episodes.  only one ep seems unnecessary ('etc.' could have been a 5 min. montage), while the rest are absolutely thrilling.  each episode turns the screws a little tighter on its featured character until shonen bat (lil' slugger in english dub) saves the day.  the intelligent conceptualization and questions raised - little pertinent info is spoonfed - makes subsequent viewings very rewarding.  (extra tip - watch it with a friend so you'll have someone to dissect the ep with afterward.)  satoshi kon takes extreme situations and humanizes them so expertly you may pray for shonen bat well before his entrances.  what's real, what's not?  satoshi kon gets so far inside the character's heads it's almost beside the point.  it's an adventurous series that'll get under your skin.",1348185600,,1352,4.881578947368421

The story it's self is layered and has a creepy dark side to it.  I won't go into the story much at all b/c I don't wish to spoil it.

It is a very adult anime a psychological roller coaster ride.

The Animation is done very well, the voice acting even in the English dub was done better then most anime's out there.

The story however is out there and may make a lot of people avoid it but may also make a lot of people like it, the story is very short but it actually ends, Some say it ends poorly some say badly.  Personally I was not disappointed but I was not impressed either. The story also is very short even for a anime.

2317189,5,B0009RQS7I,"Paranoia Agent is without question the blueprint for the proper way for Anime to do the seductively dark and complex structure of human nature. In defining existential horror in comparison; the layers of human vice and corruption are laid bare, without giving away the true motivation of the avenging nature of the plot; thus allowing the viewer (you) to use your own understanding to decipher the meanings. Truly a masterpiece of Anime horror, I'm often reminded of the complexity of Stephen Kings ""The Stand"" and my favorite line for the story ""Come down here and eat chicken with me beautiful, its so dark..."".",1299369600,,613,4.961165048543689

In Paranoia agent he goes further than confusing the viewer about who's perspective he is using; but it didn't click for me.  Also, much of the mystery in this show comes from things that aren't even remotely explained.  I don't want to go into details for sake of not spoiling anything for who ever reads this, but I'm pretty sure i understood what happened in the show and was rather turned off by the development of the plot.  Paranoia agent is definately worth checking out, but is curiously enough over shadowed by an anime about a pop singer's rise to stardom; so maybe check it out on a free tv web site or get the boot leg because a hundred dollars is a lot for an anime these days.",1283644800,,793,4.448275862068965
2317201,4,B0009RQS7I,"With three full-length animated feature films behind him of the calibre of Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers, Satoshi Kon certainly doesn't need the length afforded by a 13 episode anime series to develop complex ideas and innovative animation techniques, but it's fascinating all the same to see the ideas and themes of one of Japan's greatest filmmakers - some indeed left-over from his earlier films - expanded across a wider range of characters in Paranoia Agent.

The underlying theme of the series becomes apparent fairly quickly, each episode focussing largely on one particular character who it becomes clear is going to be the next seemingly random victim of a mysterious baseball-bat wielding school kid on rollerblades, known as Lil' Slugger (or Shonen Bat), who has been terrorising the neighbourhood.  Each of the characters, while seemingly having lives and careers to aspire to, all however have deep personal and personality problems, finding themselves cornered and only able to be released from their torment by a vicious whack across the head by the enigmatic rollerbladed assailant who corners them in an alleyway late at night.  As the tagline indicates ""When darkness overcomes the heart, Lil' Slugger appears"".

This alone is a very entertaining concept, but there is much more to Paranoia Agent than that.  There are other connections between the characters, and rather than just repeating variations on a theme, Satoshi Kon peels away layers and manages to develop the relationship between them as the series progresses, quite brilliantly making a comment on people as individuals as well as what this says about the modern society they live in and the demands it places on them, ""investigating a generation"" through its lifestyle and interests (manga and anime included), and where random and seemingly inexplicable violence is an accepted part of everyday life, and in some cases an answer.  Answers however are not always so easy to come by in Paranoia Agent.

Everything about the series is well-conceived and masterfully executed, the tone established effectively by the rather disturbing sight of the characters laughing hysterically at the apocalypse during the rather unusual opening title sequence through to their peaceful slumber on the grass at the end of each episode.  In between Satoshi Kon draws on a variety of techniques (capably animated by the Madhouse studio) some of which can be seen in his features - freeze-frame still sequences, an overlapping comic narrative in one episode that recalls Alan Moore's Watchmen - but he takes them to another level here.

After the first seven episodes that set up the premise, the story seems to descend into Twin Peaks weirdness and there is no doubt some filler material included, but it all adds to the legend of Shonen Bat, before his origins and his legacy are revealed in the explosive apocalyptic conclusion.  That seems like a very traditional Japanese comic-book convention, but in reality the whole series is indeed a commentary on anime themes and their origins, as well as what they tell us about Japanese society today.  You'd expect nothing less from Satoshi Kon, would you?",1279670400,,3192,5.190661478599222

2317203,5,B0009RQS7I,"I am a Kon Satoshi devotee.  I never know quite where he is going to take me, and I rarely understand what happened even when I reach that destination, but it is always a hell of a ride.

""Paranoia Agent"" is Kon's first attempt at an ongoing series.  The plot was stitched together out of left-over ideas he had from his feature films, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Blue/dp/B00000JL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Blue</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millennium-Actress/dp/B0000AK80C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millennium Actress</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Godfathers/dp/B0001EFTVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Godfathers</a>, ideas that he liked but couldn't figure out how to fit them into the various movies.  Working with the extended length of a television series, Kon was able to explore and expand on all of these ideas, fitting them into an over-arching plot.

The series has an ensemble cast, each with a complete story arc.  Sagi Tsukiko is a young female character designer who has created the wildly popular character Maromi.  An introspective and lonely girl, Sagi is the first to encounter the phenomenon known as Shonen Bat, a roller-skating punk with a crocked golden baseball bat who strikes those who have come to a desperate point in their lives.  Detectives Ikari Keiichi and Maniwa Mitsuhiro try to hunt down the attacker, but find themselves drawn into a mysterious world beyond understanding.

""Paranoia Agent"" is very much a Kon Satoshi series, and if you like his stuff then you are going to love this.  All of his favorite themes are on display such as duality (Chono Harumi is a girl with a split personality.  One a nice, sweet office lady, the other an aggressive and sexy prostitute.), identity (Detective Maniwa gets drawn so far into the plot he loses himself to become the super-hero Radar Man), real vs. unreal (the character Maromi seems innocent enough at first...).  It is nice that Kon had the extra length to play with all of these themes, and while some of the episodes seem like interludes every single second of screen time is worth watching.",1244160000,,2257,5.847560975609756
2317204,4,B0009RQS7I,"The first two disks (eps. 1-7) are a thrill ride, focussing on different characters who are involved with a psychotic preteen called Shonen Bat (little slugger), who careens around with a bent gold-painted aluminum bat while on Rollerblades and bashes people who are psychologically damaged, and also with an animated dog and his creator, who are the connecting thread throughout the episodes.

The third disk (eps. 8-10) is not so good. It diverges from the main story to deal with three people who half-want to commit suicide (boring), some gossipeuses, who create talltales about Shonen Bat (ok, but unnecessary), and then a meta-episode about the art of animation narrated by that cartoon dog--and with an unbearably screechy voice (excruciating).

The fourth disk returns to the main story, such as it is. It ends dramatically, but fails to tell us what happened to some of the characters we've met along the way. It feels rushed, too. It's as if (and maybe this was precisely the case) the creators were told that they must wrap everything up in 13 episodes.

The animation is superb. The use of color, light, and shadow, is breathtaking.",1217808000,2,1144,4.979057591623037
2317205,5,B0009RQS7I,"At it's basest level; ""Paranoia Agent"" is the story of a girl and her dog.  But before you even begin to understand it on that level you will be subjected to a case study on the fragility of the human psyche, the domination of it by media in today's world, the various forms of escapism devised by the human mind, and the power of an animated series to bring together storytelling and metaphor in ways that are impossible in nearly any other format.  This is simpy one of the most thought-provoking series of any kind out there and anybody who thinks that the anime genre is split between kid's stuff and pornography should consider this the ultimate vindicator.

""Paranoia Agent"" uses an unusual style of narrative.  Each episode follows a different protagonist or group and examines their particular brand of escapism/psychosis. Each character is related in some way to one or more of the characters previously met and thus the overall story grows.  The binding elements are two characters: the merchandising sensation Maromi the cartoon dog, and a mysterious figure known as ""Shonen Bat"" (""Lil Slugger"" in the English version)- a rollerblading menace who assaults people with a bent baseball bat.  Both are symbols of the pervasiveness and power of modern media in warping people's minds and perceptions to the point that an imaginary child-thug can become a murderous demon and otherwise reasonable people can be incited to riot over a child's toy.  The characters range from an overwieght otaku who is WAY too into his cosplay dolls (way underused) to a woman with split personalites who threaten each other using her answering machine to a trio of internet friends whimsically attempting (and always failing) to commit suicide together.  Then there are the two detectives.  The no-nonsense cop whose inability to see past practical reality and recognize metaphor eventually causes him to escape reality altogether in favor of an old-fashioned two-dimensional dream world, and the other who indulges in the world of fantasy and fiction without being consumed by it and becomes the only one who can see the truths of Maromi and Shonen Bat.  This is a brilliant illustration of the power of fantasy to portray truths of the world to those with open minds and the power of a closed mind to blind you to those same truths.  These and many more characters' stories intersect each other often and help to build the larger narrative which climaxes with the media's self-contradictory cocktail of paranoia-mongering, and mind-numbing comsumer-based escapist comfort becomes a single all-consuming deluge that all began -and must end- with the same little girl.

Sound complicated?  It is, but even if all this talk of metaphors and psychology turns you off, ""Paranoia Agent"" is still a very fun series that comes highly recommended.  There is a ton of black humor, great art and animation, interesting characters with well-written dialogue, one of the best opening credit sequences out there, and much more.  And my two year-old absolutely LOVES Maromi.  This is a show that can be enjoyed on the surface level, but it that really pays off when you delve into it's social and psychological depths.

2317225,5,B0009RQS7I,"From the creator of the Christmas anime classic, ""Tokyo Godfathers,"" and the psychologically charged thriller ""Perfect Blue,"" Satoshi Kon brings us yet another amazing example of Japanese animation at its finest. A series that all mature audiences can enjoy, Paranoia Agent is a thoughtful anime series no anime enthusiast should go without seeing.

As hinted at Paranoia Agent has a lot going for it. From absolutely stunning visuals to an engrossing mystery-storyline, Paranoia Agent will keep you on the edge of your seat in style. The series features fast paced action sequences coupled with psychologically gripping imagery, as did Kon's ""Perfect Blue,"" which happens to be frighteningly eerie. Such uncanny elements are equally strengthened as the series progresses by way of its remarkable soundtrack.

Images on screen are presented in a clear manner except when the thematic aspects of human psychology come into play. There, Paranoia agent delivers its sequences in a terrifying way just as ""Perfect Blue"" had done. Unlike ""Perfect Blue"" fast paced animation and stunning visuals are surpassed by leaps and bounds (similar, in this reviewer's opinion, to Makoto Shinkai's ""A Place Promised in Our Early Days,"" or Koichi Chigira's ""Last Exile,"" if not in actual style than in an intense coloring which contributes to the film's positive aesthetic qualities).

The story is, of course, well known to the avid anime enthusiast. There's an individual on golden rollerblades who goes around with a golden baseball bat and assaults people, later in the series killing them outright. The mystery-elements of the story are explored by two amusingly opposite detectives - the straight minded, heavy-set alcohol imbibing detective - and his partner, a wiry handsome fellow more willing to listen than his overeager partner.

The story becomes deeply psychological when the audience realizes that the individuals who are assault happen to be connected: they all lead troubled lives and desire a quick solution to those troubles. Enter the character Lil Slugger, a mysterious young individual with near-superhuman abilities to hear the psychological outcries of emotionally stranded individuals. With one hit he can erase all the pain... but there's a cost for peace of mind.

Under the veil of an extremely fast-paced and well designed psychological thriller, Paranoia Agent also offers philosophical themes such as the nature of reality, morality, and what amounts to a commentary about Socrates' ""The Good Life."" Without giving any spoilers, it can be mentioned that while such things don't have to be considered while watching the anime, the series does provide quite a bit of food for thought for those who are so inclined to ask such critical questions (as many good anime series do).

Whether or not you're into an action/suspense anime, an eerie psychological thriller, a philosophy-charged anime to watch and treasure, or just an interesting work of animated art, Paranoia Agent is a must see!",1144281600,6,3000,5.331923890063425
2317226,5,B0009RQS7I,"I'm really thankful that they decided to show this one on Adult Swim, otherwise I never would have heard of it.  As it was, it was my favorite series of last year.  Without giving away too much of the plot this series concerns a minor street crime, an assault of a young, female artist by a kid with a baseball bat, that escalates into something more.  After this was over, I hunted down Perfect Blue, and I feel that both anime cover some of the same themes about the nature of reality and human psychology.  So, if you like Perfect Blue, you will probably like  this series.

My sister, who is not a big anime fan, really like this one from the start.  My brother, who is a big anime fan, had to let it grow on him.  I liked it from the first moment I watched the intro, laughing people in apocalyptic situations set to the song, ""Dream Island Obsessional Park.""

After several acclaimed and well recieved films (""Perfect blue"", ""Tokyo Godfathers"") his new series would be psychological thriller. The series was released stateside last year by Geneon and then aired on Cartoon Network in summer 2005.

The show concerns an attacker called lil slugger, a teen on roller skates who weilds a golden baseball bat to attack his victims. In the first episode he attacks a character designer Tsukiko- a woman who's creation Maromi has become hugely popular (think hello kitty). Under pressure and a loooming deadline to create another hit Akiko is attacker by Lil Slugger. The attack buys her more time. Meanwhile investigators look into the attack  they can find no evidence to support her story. Did she make lil slugger up to save her career?

The next twelve episodes examine how the the idea of lil slugger goes from a few isolated attacks and spreads to become part of the cultural psyche. The episodes are self contained and yet all connect to each other. Some are better than others. I personally liked one episode in particular in which 3 gossipy women swap lil slugger stories. the episode gives you an idea of how lil slugger has become a part of the nation's conscious and provides a bit of black humor.

Personally I found Paranoia Agent to have one of the strongest set of opening episodes. The first few follow the various lil slugger attacks. We see how they are connected and how lil slugger goes from being a new story to a topic of everyday converstaion amongst people. Later episodes get disjointed and the last few become close to unwatchable.

Despite its great opening episodes the show veers into a convoluted and somewhat unbelievable ending. Many people call it brilliant and fascinating (most also note they watched Satoshi Kon's commentary to help them with what he was trying to say). I think the message was ambitious but the execution of the series ending left a lot to be desired. i believe there is a large chunk of people who gave this show fantastic reviews because they are afraid to say the ending wasn't that good. But in all reality the Emperor has no clothes on and this show's ending was mucky and disappointing in my opinion.

Overall ""paranoia agent"" is a show that starts out with a lot of promise but in the end fails to keep it. Major Kudos go to the theme song. It really is one of the best anime theme songs and craziest opening sequences for any TV show out there.

I recommend you rent/watch if you can before committing to buy.",1140307200,25,2611,4.750551876379691
2317229,5,B0009RQS7I,"I discovered this show by accident. I was watching adult swim and I saw a theme song with people laughing. Yes...and they were doing it in the worst-case scenario situations. Then...as the show ran on, I was afraid. It was really creepy...basically its about a kid with a baseball hat and roller-skates hits random people with a golden baseball bat and everyone is wondering who it is. He gets the name Lil Slugger and a demon is born. This might be the best anime show in my opinion, but it really creeps you out. The animation is beautiful and scary and the story keeps you guessing until you find out something in the show and you start to guess with new theroys. This is defientley worth the buy, and even though the only down-fall is its only 13 episodes, its still great. I would reccommened this to anyone, for this is the best anime so far in history...",1128988800,4,861,4.455696202531645
2317230,5,B0009RQS7I,"This is the best anime I've seen since Evangellion.  Like Eva, it is difficult to talk about this anime without giving away spoilers.  Sorry if my review is a little cryptic, but I don't want to spoil the show for anyone.

For anime fans out there, if you like Eva and Serial Experiments: Lain, then you should like Paranoia Agent.  It reminds me a lot of Lain, except with a better thought out plot and conclusion.  It reminds me of Eva because there is so much symbolism that this is a show that you'll be able to watch many times and still not catch everything.

On the surface, the show is about an inline skater who hits helpless people on the head with his crooked golden baseball bat.  Soon Tokyo, and then Japan, become fearful and fascinated with the assailer.  Beneath the surface, the show is about paranoia.  It's about the pressure of modern life, and the mythologies we build for ourselves.  It's about distinguishing between victimizing and being victimized.  It's about the excuses we make for our actions.  It's about being trapped when our fantasy and reality come into conflict with each other.  That's about as much as I can say without spoiling the show for you.

Paranoia Agent is not a show for everyone.  The themes and storylines are very adult.  This is a heavy show.  It can almost be excruciating at time, with the stress and paranoia it tries to instill in the viewer.  Some episodes deal with issues like prostitution and suicide (in other words, this isn't a show for kids).  At the same time, P.A. has its lighthearted and dark comedic moments.  Still, Maromi, the big headed pink dog, is just plane creepy.

If you enjoy intelligent and challenging entertainment, then please watch this show.  I only listened to the Japanese language track with subtitles, so I can't tell you if the English dub is any good.  The animation is gorgeous.",1126483200,11,1869,4.6656441717791415
