8029633,5,B00005LC5W,"Four coworkers are trapped after the high rise building they work in is bombed.  Their above-world tensions (one of the 4 was just fired, and the firer and the replacement are among the group) increase as odds for survival drop.
The whole movie pretty much takes place in a single room, but I never thought the low budget got in the way of the story.  You certainly feel their claustrophobia and the hot, stale air they are breathing.  A very urban version of films that explore how people try to survive when pushed to their limits.",1010620800,,533,4.53125
