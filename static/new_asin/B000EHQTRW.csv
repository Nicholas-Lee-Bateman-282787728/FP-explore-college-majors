2518881,5,B000EHQTRW,This has been by far my favorite Lifetime movie. Every actor took on his or her role very well. What else was so fantastic about this movie was by placing one of the girl's father into this world to save his daughter. This movie though frightening in many of its elements was still heartwarming. Though this is a fictious miniseries it still takes on a subject that exists today whether you believe it or not. This movie is perfect for teens who love watching lifetime movies because it explains the subject of human trafficking that effects people of their age group. The girls who get trafficked range from 6 year olds to 30 years and this movie is really eye opening. If you can only see one lifetime movie see this one.,1151193600,4,723,4.484848484848484
2518882,5,B000EHQTRW,"I watched this movie earlier in the year and it was excellent... horrifying but excellent. It is a real eye opener to the sex slave trade. I really thought that this was something of the past but there are still organizations battling these inhumane activities. Mira Sorvino is gripping as the undercover agent who gets more than she bargained for and Donald Sutherland is his usual rock as the supporting actor, boss and mentor. I highly recommend this film not only for it's content but for the acting, action and suspense.",1148860800,,525,4.78021978021978
2518883,5,B000EHQTRW,"This is quite a well done miniseries on the difficult subject matter of human trafficking. The miniseries follows the lives of a few women and children as they become caught up , against their will, within the rutheless international trafficking of sex slaves. In partcular we follow the lives of two young women and one abducted young girl as their lives turn to hell after they become pray of these callous criminals. We also follow the efforts of governemnt agencies and parents as they attempt to liberate the women from the horror that they have fallen into.

The minidrama is very well done. In particular the actresses that play the young eastern eurpoean women are quite amazing. They play their parts very convincingly. They also both have an increadibly authentic eastern european feel, despite both of them being Canadian.  All the other actors put in very good performances too. I felt very affected by this drama, as the facts portrayed about human trafficking here are not only true, but probably understated, as in truth women in these situations are treated even worst than shown here. How sad that our society has room for this kind of horrors to thrive, as it is to western customers that the services of these women and children are sold to. A drama for TV that makes one seriously think.",1146873600,23,1307,4.804444444444444
2518980,5,B000EHQTRW,This movie was incredibly heartbreaking. Women and children are sold by men for profit every day. Its a present day problem that this movie only shows a glimpse of.,1525392000,,164,4.689655172413793
2518981,5,B000EHQTRW,So truly amazing to see this epidemic portrayed in its vulgar truth. To the people who say this is too difficult to watch- there in lies the problem with this world: God forbid you actually become aware and possibly feel a 1/10th of what these victims go through.,1525219200,,263,4.5
2518982,3,B000EHQTRW,"The story line is good, the subject matter is disturbing for sure. and is something that more people need to be aware of and concerned with. However the acting and directing is fair at best. I watched the first 2 episodes and couldn't bring myself to watch anymore, not because it is disturbing, but the acting is so bad.",1525219200,,321,4.4576271186440675
2518983,4,B000EHQTRW,"This is a very timely topic and it was pretty well done.  One thing bothered me, and it was that a lot of the Philippines scenes are obviously Thailand--if you have been there or know about Thai culture, accents, etc.  Strange.  I just don't like it when the move industry assumes they can film somewhere and no one will know the difference.",1525219200,,341,4.467741935483871
2518984,5,B000EHQTRW,This movie in my opinion is the closest to the human reality of human trafficking. The only exception is that the main character s of the story had a happy ending. They were unified with their family. For the women and kids who are trafficked it does not end that way. Very good movie.,1525132800,,285,4.296296296296297

2518986,5,B000EHQTRW,"I hit mute, turned on subtitles, and hit fast-forward through the more brutal scenes. It's not all heinous; there's the classic fight of good and evil that drew me in. Excellent acting from the entire cast of all ages--doesn't look like acting. Seems they're really invested in getting truth out there.",1524960000,,302,4.9411764705882355
2518987,5,B000EHQTRW,"An excellent movie / docu-drama on a very serious subject, not only in the USA but worldwide. Tastefully done to get the point across and make you think about a not so popular discussion. I can not imagine the horror and pain a parent would go through. It also pointed out the corruption that this kind of billion dollar business generates. Shame it was only a 3 part series.",1524787200,,375,4.449275362318841

2519096,5,B000EHQTRW,"This is a topic that needs to be addressed especially if you have young girls. They need to be taught early to check out peoples credentials

and not to take anyone or anything at face value.  Trust needs to be earned and not to be given away freely. I thought all the acting was suberb .

2519098,5,B000EHQTRW,"This was an amazing look into a world that many don't really know about. I wasn't expecting to watch such a movie, but my friends ended up bring it over. Anyways, Donald Sutherland is always amazing and this is no exception to the rule.",1524355200,,236,4.386363636363637
2519099,5,B000EHQTRW,"Donald Sutherland was the most seasoned actor & he did not disappoint.  The first season was the most intense.  There were times when I had to turn away, close my eyes or just turn it off for awhile.  I had heard of human trafficking but really had no idea as to who was targeted, how they managed to recruit, the management, how widespread, & how lucrative it has become. ""The love of money is the root of all evil"" could not be more spot on.  I was not impressed with Mira Sorvino in the least ( or her bad wig )..how she became the lead actor was the only mistake-misgiving part of the entire series.",1524268800,,603,4.217391304347826
2519100,5,B000EHQTRW,This show is disturbingly true..I think that more people should watch it!!

2519104,4,B000EHQTRW,"I'm picky when it comes to films and mini series.  I watched this because I wanted to see the combination of Donald Sutherland and Mira Soveno.  And, of course, the topic was well covered, and spanned the many different countries where sex trafficking takes place. As a side note, Mira looked absolutely amazing.  They joked that she didn't look 20 anymore, but I really couldn't see it.  She was radiating.",1523750400,,407,4.771428571428571

2519176,5,B000EHQTRW,Well done and very hard to watch just because the subject matter is far too close to home.  Not near as graphic as real world but I doubt most people could watch if it was.,1523577600,,172,3.914285714285714

2519179,5,B000EHQTRW,"If I had one criticism of this movie, it is the fact that it neglects the numbers of US children who are taken for the trade--boys and girls.  Estimates place boys as high as 1/3 of all child sex trafficked victims.

Otherwise, this is a powerful portrayal of the problems that exists worldwide: the luring of children away from any security; the constant transporting of ""merchandise"" (it makes me sick to use that term!) to avoid detection and keep victims disoriented; the brutality of control; and the epidemic of demand that exists in the US.  If they do manage to get away, these children are scarred in unimaginable ways, both physically and emotionally.  I applaud everyone involved in the making of this mini-series!  The lives of victims is presented in enough detail and accuracy to hopefully warrant thoughtful viewing, to recognize the issues, to be a motivation to learn more and to motivate us to become part of the solution.

I've read some of the negative reviews, and as one comment to a review points out, if you weren't ready for the content of this movie, why did you pick it?  If you believe that if you ignore this issue it won't exist, you become part of the problem.  If you have ever considered purchasing ""merchandise,"" then you are the problem; if you trade in victims under 18, you are legally a child rapist.

Please learn more.  Search the internet for 'child sex trade in the US.'",1523491200,,1412,4.680161943319838

I know they quoted 800,000 human beings as being trafficked internationally. That was back in 2005. I can only imagine what it is now. Truthfully, I don't know how they can even BEGIN to estimate a number. Human trafficking is rampant throughout our world. What is so truly saddening about this is that if there was no demand for it, it would not be an issue. If you thought slavery was abolished in 1865, you're wrong.",1522972800,,559,4.384615384615385

2519237,2,B000EHQTRW,"Grade B melodrama with many plot implausibilities.  Best thing is Robert Carlyle, always a solid actor. Sutherland is OK & Sorvino does her usual scenery-chewing overacting with emotional expression that is often just ""off.""  A couple of supporting actors are pretty good, such as  the father of the Prague teenage wanna-be model.  Others are laughably bad, such as Annie's mother.
It's very choppy, jumping locations frequently which sometimes messes the time sequences.  The various foreign locations are interestingly filmed - maybe cgi, but they helped.  The topic is compelling but this is such a watered version with too many subplots & transparent errors in  procedures.  There's no way that the safe house for the Czech witness would have been in such an exposed location or so tricked out in decor.
The subject matter deserves better handling. Lifetime Movie fans might like this.",1522281600,,889,5.211267605633803

2519243,5,B000EHQTRW,"It is interesting to note that one of the primary law enforcement agencies responsible for fighting this category of crime is ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).  It is also the agency so despised by liberal leaders in ""sanctuary"" cities and states.  Many (and probably most) of the victims of human trafficking are brought into this country illegally by the monsters who profit from this crime.  Those who would thwart the efforts of ICE clearly make a large contribution to the wealth and security of the practitioners of human trafficking (along with those who deal in illegal drugs and import new members for gangs such as MS-13).

Highly recommended for adults and very mature intelligent older teens, as it's something important to know about... as a cautionary tale. We must all watch over our children and teens with heightened awareness. As sordid and shocking as this presentation is, it doesn't even ""go high enough"" in its reach into governmental and institutional complicity. There are a lot of very twisted souls out there who get their kicks from sex, power, money and control... and some of them operate in criminally filthy high levels of politics and finance.",1521849600,,714,5.327433628318584

2519268,3,B000EHQTRW,"I'm glad that this topic is being shown and discussed. Although the movie was informative overall I can't say that the two lead actors did anything to enhance the story. Donald Sutherland has been around for some time and done some great work in the past. The last couple of times that I've seen him, he was just Donald Sutherland.  This outing is no different. As for Mira, I know I've seen her is other things but don't remember much about her. Perhaps that's a comment on her acting skills or maybe I didn't care for the movie she was in. The bad guys and parents were all well done considering they didn't have much of a script to work with. I agree with other reviewers that the plot was not original at all and the back story for Mira's character was way too contrived.  Then, of course, the communication device goes bad at a critical moment but the good guys rush in just in time.  I don't think this reveal will ruin anything for potential viewers. you'll know by the time you get to this point in the movie what's going to happen.

I'm giving it three stars because the subject matter is important and I now have a better understanding of how this terrible crime operates on a global scale. If we come away with nothing more than knowing this crime exists, we can also know that this country is not exempt from contributing to the problem.  What are we doing wrong?  How can we, as a people, be one of the biggest users of this awful practice. Are we paying enough attention to what goes on around us and are we willing to step up and report a situation even, if it means we might be in the spotlight.",1520640000,,1611,4.317880794701987

It shows the many snares and entrapments that capture unsuspecting victims into the prison of human trafficking, which I found enlightening, while answering questions that I had. It was disturbing, on many levels, but so is human trafficking!  I decided that if people have to live inside something like this, then I can sure watch it for the limited time of this docu-drama.

2519477,3,B000EHQTRW,"The Lifetime cable channel made TV history with this ambitious, acclaimed original miniseries on the horrifying phenomenon of human trafficking, or sexual slavery.

It follows the fictional cases of young women around the world, lured or abducted, sometimes right off the street, into a world of unspeakable brutality--which the filmmakers show in almost overwhelming detail at times.

Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland star as American government officials bent on exposing and stopping the phenomenon, and both are more than serviceable in their roles. But the revelation is Robert Carlyle, the Scottish star of The Full Monty and Trainspotting, who here is transformed into a ruthless criminal mastermind behind his own trafficking network. Even his Eastern European accent is spot-on and blood-chilling.

The supporting cast of women and girls is strong, and in some cases, truly heartbreaking. And while sometimes almost unbearably harsh, the film serves as a reminder this terrible situation still exists and thrives; and told through the characters, is also a well-paced thriller.",1391472000,,1088,5.581818181818182

2519484,5,B000EHQTRW,"I don't think this movie is for entertainment or enjoyment (unless you are a sadistic person).

I salute and thank all those getting the truth out on this horrible crime on humanity.  Other movies exposing this are, Trade of Innocents (also Mira Sorvino), The Whistleblower (Rachel Weisz), and Trade (Kevin Kline).  The only way to change something is to expose it.  I thought the movie was 'descent', not overtly sexual and very minimal in nudity, but tried to be truthful to get across the reality of this brutality.  I KNOW these movies 'can't even cover more of the darkest of crimes being committed -- this really is evil.

Too me, many people are stuck in complacency, especially, in America, ""It isn't happening to me so things must be just fine"".  People who I know consider themselves to be caring, but won't look at anything 'negative'? What?  Human Trafficking is happening in America (epidemically) under our noses.  Where is our empathy, caring, concern for each other and more importantly our children - This is what makes us ""Human"". Look around, have you lost, have we lost our 'humanity'?  It seems like we are losing ground, because the debauchery is gaining fast.

America is the one country still, who can help and make changes, but truth in media is suppressed and propagandized.  Whistleblowers are now jailed, killed, and persecuted for doing the 'right' thing.

The truth is still out there.

We have to be able to face the truth that torture, rape, and murder are an epidemic everywhere and our own 'government' is part of it. The statistics for the abduction and selling of women and children is 2.5 million a year.  Our own soldiers are forced to take part in this brutality.  An Iraqi veteran Daniel Somers just committed suicide, leaving a gut and heart wrenching note on what he was forced to do to civilians: families, women and children.  He said, if he could go on in a 'normal life he would be a 'sociopath'.  Twenty two (22) soldiers commit suicide every day, many most likely who can't get over what what they did.  My point here, is much of this is all wrapped up together in government/corporate 'criminal organizations'.

We say we want a better world for ourselves and our children, this will not happen if we are not willing to 'SEE' the horrors that are being wreaked on masses of the poor and the weak by the (criminals within) the very powers pretending to care.  There is a hell being raised on earth...human trafficking: labor and sex slavery is increasing in all countries, human organ trafficking, drug trafficking, and manufactured economic destruction are all being carried out by criminal elements in the highest of world organizations. (The Whistleblower)

I, hate and am very disturbed by these movies for the right reasons, they are horrific, but again, I am so appreciative to those exposing what must be brought into the light.  Don't let these victims be forgotten like they didn't matter - they mattered just like our families and children matter.

2519495,2,B000EHQTRW,"This is emotionally disturbing in a way exceeding other movies exposing the horrific trafficking industry. The initial innocence and ultimate brutalizing of the young characters is, in a dramatic sense, extraordinarily well portrayed. Too well, perhaps: I found it emotionally too disturbing. The criticism made by some professional reviewers that too much skin ( and terror? humiliation?) is exposed, i.e., a ""exploitation of the exploited"", is unfortunately valid.
  See the documentary ""Nefarious"" for a realistic, comprehensive view of this sordid industry that will not leave you feeling emotionally soiled. Or Sorvino's later work, ""Trade of Innocence""",1369180800,4,658,5.84375

2519527,5,B000EHQTRW,"I cannot believe anyone would have any complaints whatsoever about this movie. One exception: the current data is more that 800,000 women and children are trafficked over the Mexico/US border each year (the actual number runs more than a million), that's over the US border--usually into the US, not worldwide. Worldwide trafficking is staggering. The topic/issue remains contemporary and, tragically, the numbers are growing--while the average age of victims is getting younger.

The acting was top-notch and both US stars were up for Emmys. All the actors did a solid job--I could not make one complaint and I'm a fairly picky movie viewer--I don't like my time wasted. It wasn't. I have to say I was glued and drawn the entire time. Solid story, plot, very fluid, believable writing, set, etc., and, again, a top-notch Director (catch the bonus features after the movie: you'll hear Donald Sutherland go into detail about this director).

It's a movie (actually a miniseries) to keep in your collection--especially if you like the history of the fundamental root cause of the escalating Human Rights' violations/abuses, predation, sadism and torture that is as contemporary today as it was during the Holocaust. It is the contemporary Holocaust that must not be neglected.",1327104000,6,1275,5.214634146341464

Neither can I, there are some rarely glimmers of light in the many stories in this film but it lacks the gravity because it's so disjointed. Nothing against Mira Sorvino but would you really expect a victim of childhood sexual assault to be so calm and seemingly unruffled through the movie? Or that a goon wouldn't recognize her from a surveillance attempt? Nothing against the actress but I would say that Donald Sutherland eclipses her in believability and his interrogation is pathetic.

2519534,5,B000EHQTRW,"This movie is 180 minutes long, and yes, there are definitely storylines and pieces that could have been cut out to make it shorter. However, I understand some of the reasoning behind showing all the little substories they did. It gives viewers a wider scope of how different people are affected by this horrific business.

Helena, Nadia, Annie, and Kate have vastly different backgrounds, but they all become intricately affected by Sergei Karpovich's gigantic sex slave empire. Kate throws all her effort into shutting Karpovich down, while Annie, Helena, and Nadia experience first hand the horrors and pains brought forth by a mixture of greed, power-addiction, and lust.

I wondered why this movie wasn't rated. I would say it is strongly PG-13. It's not a feel-good movie, but it is powerful and it has a message: Modern Day Slavery is alive and well in all its ugly glory. Nothing horrific is shown in all its gritty detail, but there's definitely enough there that you know exactly what's going on.

On the DVD are some websites to get involved in stopping this atrocious activity. This leaves one with some type of hope because the trafficking is worldwide and it seems like it is impossible to stop. The movie is disturbing, especially if you have no idea about the extent of human trafficking.

I liked how the story went accross several locations and characters to depict that this happens everywhere, even to a middle-class family from USA.

This movie being PG is good and bad. Good like others mentioned because it allows the movie to be watched as a family to raise these important issues to the common naiveties youth have. Bad becuase an R rated movie, without the director exploiting the subject, would allow so much more depth into the true horror of the situation, to really cause the viewer to feel affected by the pain endured by these individuals. Essentially allowing the subject to stay with you and haunt you, to make the viewer mad enough to want to be part of the solution.

The movie itself does a good job of bringing light to the subject in many forms. Because of the subject matter and length of the DVD, viewers erge to have the 'hollywood ending' of everything going to be alright at the end. If only it could always be that way. A true movie on the subject would unfortunately spare this type of ending, and create awareness at the end, opposed to just statistics.  As the other 2 star reviews mentioned, there are several pits in the story. The dad travelling to save his daughter is complete hollywood. Especially becuase when he gets there he just has to watch it happen and can't do anything about it, until the true to life rarity of the police saving the day.

This movie is a complete straight to DVD release though in terms of its camera work, acting, subdued in the background music,  and the overall story stucture. Mira Sorvino is really stiff in this performance. Most of the time she is very monotoned with only the odd exception. There was some overacting, and some underacting (most notibly from the american parents who just didn't show enough real life panic and devestation. And the stupidity of the mother screaming at the offender on the phone when that could easily get her daughter killed).

Would I recommend seeing the movie - absolutely. Its one of the few with this subject matter, and it really opens your eyes to the subject. I however feel there is so much more to be had on one of the touchiest subjects most of the world has isolated their attention from. Its insane how people in modern time can literally lose their identity, freedom, and most of all - their humanity. I really hope in the future this subject will be treated to academy award winning performances from screenplay writers and directors with years of research on the subject; instead of just exploiting it like in the movie 'Taken'. (and in addition, a well thought out documentary would be nice too) In the meantime, there are a number of good books 'not for sale' and 'a crime so montrous.' Unlike anything i've ever seen before, this subject really encourages me to see what I can do to help, and I hope more likeminded people can help stop today's greatest tragedy.",1235347200,,3037,4.646182495344506

[Each year,] approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries.

This movie portrays the crime of sex trafficking and child sex trafficking, it is well produced and shows much of the brutality one would expect to find in such a criminal enterprise. Through further research I have discovered some of the lasting effects which result from sex trafficking. First and foremost there is death, so many die from physical abuse and violence, but many more perish because of AIDS, botched abortions, untreated infections, malnutrition, and sadly even from suicide. Those who have been fortunate enough to escape or who have been rescued are left with so many scars, both physical and psychological. Many are left infertile as the result of prolonged sexual abuse and improper medical treatment. It is impossible to cover the scope of human trafficking in one movie, which is why this one focuses on sex trafficking; however it is important to realize that  trafficking exists in so many areas. Victims can be found in the agricultural fields, garment industries, mines, construction, fishing villages, domestic servitude, hotel industry, and restaurants. Sadly my list is incomplete, victims are found in so many more areas than just these. I encourage everyone to learn as much as possible about this horrendous criminal enterprise.

Oh my God, the tears poured from my eyes to watch those little babies being brutalized by those pigs and it literally hurts to watch it knowing that right now it's happening to many real children in the world. Any pig who can hurt anyone but especially a child deserves to go to hell before even Hitler and Stalin. This film will kill something inside of you, but you must watch it because IT'S REAL!

Honestly, after watching this you might not let your child out of your sight until he is 30.

Is there any vice that doesn't turn into a profitable business in America ?

This particular movie traces the rancid path of kidnapping, rape, and sexual slavery from Russia through Mexico and then into America.

I don't know how real this movie is but the phenomenon itself is definitely real.  This same thing is happening in Iraq as people flee the violence only to face something worse as refugees.

That's what's scary about this movie.  These girls are running away from something that's as bad as what happens to them.  People don't run away from a normal life.

The Italian mafia was bad enough in its hey day but I don't think they can compare with the Columbians and Russians as far as their brutality and ruthlessness.

There's also a side plot with child trafficking in the Phillipines which is apparently one of the other human cess pools in the world.

Then sometimes people from the wealthy countries go to the cess pools instead.  They show that side of it also.

The acting in this movie is flat at times.

Rather it's the the message that is so important.

Whether or not this movie will help solve this horrendous problem I don't know.

For me personally I wouldn't want to travel to the Phillipines, Mexico, etc..

There's a lot of riff raff coming across the U.S. / Mexican border.

2519600,2,B000EHQTRW,"Mira Sorvino, Donald Sutherland, Robert Carlyle--solid actors with a history of excellent work to prove it.

My probelm here is with the jerky camera (like watching a car commercial), weak direction and weaker writing.
Is it necessary to show someone shedding tears every ten, fifteen minutes or going on some hysterical jag to keep reminding us how dire the situation is?

(Overacting is no fun to watch. Director's fault, that one.)

Yes, something should be done about the problem of human trafficking, and I hope governments of all nations have had their eyes opened up a bit, but the way things are presented here literally make you cringe.

Flick is abundant with cliches and implausabilities. Good stories are character-driver, as opposed to plot-driven.
So much here is idiotic and lacks credibility. Sorvino's background is absolutely sloppy  writing (not to mention lazy) and not needed. Her bickering with her (husband? boyfriend? Not sure) was not only ridiculous, but annoying as hell.

Here she is this U.S. government-trained I.C.E agent, right?--but the (primary) reason she is able to relate to one of the  females (who had been abducted in the Check  Republic and smuggled into  the U.S. and forced into prostitution) is because she, herself, had been molested by her (FAVORITE) uncle years before at age 12.

Come on. (I say by merely Sorvino's agent being a decent human being,  with a need to do the right thing, would have taken care of that, without the writers resorting to this contrived background tale that stuck out as such like a sore thumb.)

Not only that, she ALSO happens to be Russian as well (by birth), who was raised in the U.S. (therefore giving her EVEN MORE CREDIBILITY with all these females who had been abducted in various countries overseas).
Also, later on in the film, she passes herself off as a Russian mail-order bride wannabe. Wait a minute. Are you kidding me? ARE YOU SERIOUS? (she does this to go undercover.)

REALLY? Don't you realize you're insulting the viewer?
HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID THESE WRITERS ACTUALLY DO--IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

SPOILER AHEAD:

At some point in the film, one of the victims, having been freed and given protective custody, is being shown her hotel room where she will be staying for a certain duration. While her ""protector"" Agent Sorvino is  chatting on her cell phone, the said female (in protective custody) steps out on the balcony to take in the view below.
Guess what happens next? Said ""PROTECTED"" female is chilled by a sniper --- to Agent Sorvino's horror and dismay.

Sure. You call this writing? Tell me another fairytale. Better yet, learn your movie cliches (so that you might avoid them when you write your next HBO special, folks.)

This is what I mean by hack writing. And there are so many other situations that reek of cliche and/or WAY TOO FAR-FETCHED  and/or SEEN IT BEFORE WAY TOO MANY TIMES in other weak flicks.

I'll end this rant by saying this is not the definitive take on the topic. I hope a real writer with some serious talent writes a screenplay about trafficking in humans, and that a genuinely talented film director handles the reins.",1183248000,9,3151,4.843283582089552
2519601,4,B000EHQTRW,"This is a good docudrama, but it could have been so much better.  First of all, I'm amazed at the reviewers who label this a ""brutal"" depiction of the slave trade.  It's very, very tame.  I guess it had to be that way to be shown on TV, but if I can easily imagine more brutal and effective means to this sickening end, I'm sure the professionals involved day in and day out are far worse.  Apparantly, these reviewers have never even glimpsed the underbelly of society.  (Lucky for them.)

  This is a real problem.  It was real a thousand years ago, and it will still be real a thousand years hence.  If TV producers were as concerned with the reality as they were about staying several yards behind the PC line, ""Human Trafficking"" might actually have had a modest impact.

  There was no problem at all with Sorvino's performance.  The acting in general, was very fine.  What was needed to propel this movie to greater heights was better music, tighter editing, and a ""vision"" to coordinate the story-line.

2519616,4,B000EHQTRW,"First, be forewarned. There are several movies/documentaries out there with similar titles. This film does NOT deal with the subject of Mexican citizens being smuggled into the U.S. This ""Human Trafficking"" is an extremely graphic, brutal picture of girls being trapped into prostitution.

I realized a sex slave trade existed, but before seeing this movie, I had no idea the practice was currently so widespread and organized. The phrase ""the slave trade"" always had a vaguely Victorian, almost comic ring to me. I knew the slave trader mainly as a bogeyman that 19th-century parents scared their daughters with, keeping them from venturing out too far or too freely into the world on their own. But I didn't know it was something that so many modern parents literally might need to guard their children against. According to this film's concluding screen facts and figures, the practice is extensive, and growing - thanks in part to hook-ups facilitated by the computer.

This film shows how young women are recruited. One thinks she has qualified for a modeling job in an exotic location. One thinks she is being courted by the man of her dreams - and flies to meet him for a vacation in another country. As soon as these deluded young women arrive at their destinations - the bars on their lives clang shut. It is difficult for most of them to survive the horrors they face.

Robert Carlyle is chilling here in his role as the head of a multi-national slave trafficking operation. He is a brutal juggernaut of all business-only business - in distinct contrast with the affably entrepreneurial character he played in ""The Full Monty.""

Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland are less well cast as the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents on the trail of traffickers. There is something off about the dynamic between these two. It's the clich of the female agency rookie who has to prove herself to her crusty unit boss. We've seen it a thousand times in everything from ""Silence of the Lambs"" down to current CSI episodes. But, there's something a little unnerving about this particular teaming. Unintentionally, I'm sure, there is even a disconcerting shadow of the slave trade dynamic being reenacted between these two. Sorvino is the much younger woman, being handled, managed, overseen, by the much older man. Southerland sits back in cold appraisal of her until the end, when he throws her a crumb of approval - which she might pathetically be led to interpret as affection?

Also, the blondness that Sorvino has affected in recent pictures is so at odds with her natural brunette beauty - that she in her own way appears to be tricked out for sale. We see strands of her Paris Hilton hairdo straggling out of her ICE cap as she pursues the bad guys. In order to keep this film from slipping dangerously close to being an exploitation of its sensationalism subject matter, it might have been better to cast a professional-looking woman working with her ICE colleagues as a true equal. After the horrors of Carlyle's sex trade, viewers need a place of relief and refuge - a place where we feel the values of proper human relations are being upheld. We don't quite get that here though.

This movie is depressing and jarring throughout. It will awaken viewers to a growing problem. I hope it doesn't just stop at galvanizing celebrity problem-of-the-month fundraisers though. I hope it might provoke a deeper consideration of the factors in human nature that make this kind of slave trade so hugely, perennially profitable.",1174262400,13,3537,4.896494156928214

All in all a great miniseries perfect if only they would have cast somebody else as Kate Morozov, honestly I don't see how anybody will believe Mira Sorvino as a Ukranian-American somebody else would have done the trick. Donald Sutherland on the other hand as her boss excels., but the greatest performances come from Isabelle Blais & Laurence Lebouef (who play the victims) honestly they are outstanding.

Is an honest, brutal and harsh look onto one of the biggest problem the U.S. and the world deals with today. don't miss it",1173657600,4,783,4.546099290780142
2519619,5,B000EHQTRW,"I rented the DVD not really knowing what to expect. Having written articles on the subject, I expected a watered down version of a disturbing reality. According to the statistics cited in this excellent movie, over 800,000 people in the US are victims of this form of slavery. It is, thanks to the fact we are the number one consumer of these victims, rapidly outstrippping narcotics in revenues.

What Human Trafficking exposes in an in your face, pull no punches style, is a harsh reality we all need to look at and discuss with our children. Thanks to superbly understated performances by Donald Sutherland and Mira Sorvino, the story itself is allowed to shine.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find Sorvino too pretty, but an intelligent, ambitious but very humane woman who approaches Sutherland to let her become a member of ICE. Think Jodie Fosters character which infuses Sorvino's performance. Donald Sutherland plays his role as her boss deftly and with great subtlety.

This movie spares nothing. The treatment of the children and women is raw and very brutal. All the actors portraying the victims offer stellar performances.

Human Trafficking spans several continents in an attempt to show just how these sex slaves are either lured or outtright taken by these monsters in human flesh. There are several subplots interwoven thoughout the movie.

One involves the enticing of young girls from Eastern Bloc countries by offering glitzy modelling contracts in NY. Two of them end up having key roles, both heartbreaking in this disturbing film.

In the Phillipines a hotbed of child flesh peddling, an aging obese pig of an Aussie pimp specializes in very small children, both male and female, who are used until they die of disease or trauma.

Mexico receives women and often the police are active participants in the whole ordeal, many times grabbing the first ""taste"" of such young tender flesh.

And the United States with its huge consumer base waiting for these very young women and children, is a blot on our republic which stands as a symbol of refuge and hope.

If you have teens, I'd recommend watching it with them, taking the pause between the first and second part to read the real stories and discuss the statistics. Though it is very raw and potent, it may end up saving your starry eyed daughter who wants to be a model, or your children in general from being sucked in by these peddlars in human flesh.

If you are a hide your head in the sand person, who'd rather not know about such things, don't bother watching Human Trafficking. But if you care about the plight of children-children dying from AIDS and other diseases, brought on by being forced to have sex up to 12 or more times a day HERE and abroad, this should be a wake up call to get involved.",1167523200,49,2785,4.783333333333333
2519620,4,B000EHQTRW,"Human Trafficking is a bold and ambitious project; Lifetime is to be congratulated for exposing a part of society most people would prefer to ignore, and doing so in a mature, serious fashion.  Originally designed as a mini-series, it is presented here in its entirety, with convenient breaks.  This is helpful, at three hours it may be too much for the average viewer to assimilate all at once.  Even the jaded appetite will find Human Trafficking upsetting.

One must wonder about those who claim ignorance of sexual slavery as it is practiced around the world.  This appalling behavior is more than merely time-honored; it is codified and woven into the fabric of society itself.  What is surprising, and what Human Trafficking gets right, is that sexual slavery is alive, well, and lucrative.  Like drugs and weapons, a filthy business like this can only exist where there is powerful market demand, and that demand is chillingly close to home.

Human Trafficking benefits from good directing, (Christian Duguay), and some splendid performances.  Leading the way is the lovable Scot from The Full Monty, (Robert Carlyle), who plays the Eastern block criminal mastermind behind the sophisticated sexual gulag.  His accent is impeccable, and his character well realized.  Sergei Karpovich is no Cold War ham-fisted brute.  He is smart, computer-savvy, and thoroughly ruthless.  (Like so many inner-city drug dealers, under different circumstances he probably would have been a captain of legitimate industry.)

After Carlyle, the showcase performance here belongs to Isabella Blais, (Helena), one of the women whose decent into sexual slavery is tracked.  Helena is certainly not stupid, but she is vulnerable, and we watch in horror as one bad decision lures her into an unimaginable nightmare.  We also see some of the ingenious techniques used to ensure cooperation.  This is where Human Trafficking really shines.  It's never sensational, licentious, or titillating.  On the contrary, it exposes the complete banality of evil, the disturbing ordinariness of it in flat details that do not manipulate emotions.

There are two problems with Human Trafficking.  At times it gets preachy, explaining the story rather than telling it.  (With subject matter this explosive, that is completely unnecessary.)  The other is the casting of Mira Sorvino.  Sorvino is a fine actress, (her performance here is fine), but she is simply too pretty and adorable for the part.  One scene attempts to show why she would take on the hideous assignment of catching these vermin, but it's not enough.  Making her character female was an interesting decision, but to work, it should have been someone with more edge and less curve.  Donald Sutherland, as her boss, excels.

We imagine our society to be advanced, sophisticated, refined.  Thanks to the folks at Lifetime for shedding some light on the difficult truth.",1159056000,56,2901,5.2321041214750545
2519621,5,B000EHQTRW,"Imagine thinking you're watching an excellent drama series, although disturbingly realistic, you convince yourself it's only a good script. As the movie plays on and takes you deeper and deeper into the dark and horrid world of human trafficing, you can't do anything but feel helpless, scared, and horrified. This is as shocking as it comes and for those ignorant to the subject, as I was, this movie will open your eyes and will start you asking how safe are you really and how safe are the innocent children around you. They could be gone tomorrow. All for money. Get it. Watch it. Pass it on to people you know. And talk about it. Light must be shed on the darkest reaches of this world if we are to ever stop the monstrous actions found in Human Trafficing. This should have received a thousand awards just for being made in the first place and it should be shown on TV every chance it can be. My prayers will always go out to those who are in a dark place.

2519623,4,B000EHQTRW,"Human trafficking has been an issue throughout history, but has recently been getting more attention by policy makers and the press.  This film does a good job of highlighting one dimension of human trafficking -- the trafficking of women for sex.  Although a fictionalized account, the film illustrates the complex nature of the problem, including the obstacles to ending the practice. There are no easy answers, but the film reminds us that the problem is too serious to ignore. Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland are excellent, though having the federal agent played by Sorvino pose as a captured sex slave detracted from the believability of the film.  Thankfully, that was only a small element of the story.",1155168000,4,712,5.068376068376068
2519624,5,B000EHQTRW,"Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland are fantastic as police officers dedicated to breaking up a brutal and sadistic ring of predators who treat their quarry worse than dogmeat as they sell them for profit over and over again.  What makes this movie so heartbreaking is how much it personally means to Sorvino's character due to a relative who abused her in her own parents' home, and if you are a woman who has endured the mildest of abuse on that level, this will get right to you!

The victims are so incredibly sad, and you wish they could all come out of it okay, but the ones who survive it are ultimately damaged for life.  I was particularly affected by the woman Elena and, moreso, the beautiful teenager named Nadia who lived through the worst hell of the girls depicted.  Most chilling of all was that one of my favorite actors, Robert Carlyle, could play such an evil and dispicable criminal when he usually plays far more likable roles.

Huge props must be given to the men who sat through this movie, because I know a lot who won't touch it with a ten-foot pole.  It's a nasty, but all too realistic situation that must be brought to the attention of everyone in a not so bright, sunshiney Brady Bunch world.",1154563200,2,1220,4.497737556561086

The fact that this happens in our country, the fact that Jessie Jackson isn't talking about this as modern day slavery just shows how much of an undercurrent this really is in the American consciousness.

Rent this movie. Buy this movie. It's not exactly Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan in terms of an epic story but it is a good story. It's a bit mature for my young sons to watch due to the graphic sexual explotation of these women. It presents a wonderful human element to the people who are trying to fight against these people with the resources of the American government. This is a great story.

We need movies like this that informs of such activities; movies, magazines, and online information about how to live as a healthy family and what to do when the family isn't healthy. Monitoring by all social media to prevent anything that ""smells"" of these horrible activities; and legislation that would punish anyone involved with heavy fines, prison time and in some cases by death.  All predators should be imprisoned and if were directly involved in the violent  rape of others should be killed.  We stand up more for the perpetrator than the victims.

As long as people want to remain ignorant, these disgusting pieces of **** will continue to abduct, rape, drug and torture these women, children and men on a daily basis.

8109833,2,B000EHQTRW,"I really don't know how they got Donald Sutherland to sign up for this project. The writing was ridiculous, the scenarios implausible, they couldn't get decent adult actors (Sutherland aside) -- not to mention cringeworthy performances from the child actors.

The accents were all over the place. Are they Russian? Are they Hungarian? Are they Spanish? Does it matter? The 32 year old Laurence Leboeuf (playing 16 year old ""Nadia"") in particular tries to pass off a vaguely ""foreign sounding"" accent as Ukrainian -- but drops the accent every other syllable and sounds painfully Canadian. Mira Sorvino, the supposed Russian emigre ICE agent doesn't even bother with the accent at all in the scenes she's speaking Russian. Perhaps we're better off for her decision there.

In one scene, Sorvino leads a raid on a trafficking den which turns into a foot chase as she pursues a fleeing trafficker. The trafficker stops and faces her from 10 feet away. She waves a gun around, ""Stop or I'll shoot!"" The child trafficker says ""I'm looking for my daughter, Nadia!"" Sorvino stops. Tears roll down her face. She puts the gun down. The man boards a train.

Seriously? You let a guy go because he knew the name of one of the trafficked girls? And this ""touching scene"" demands another ubiquitous tight shots of a woman's crying face? ""Yeah, she's all decked out in an ICE uniform and has a gun, but deep down, she's a HUMAN BEING!"" Give me a break. Every person in this movie makes a constant stream of decisions that are not just stupid, but utterly inexplicable.

But back to those tight shots of women's crying faces. The editing and cinematography is awful. EMOTION! *tight shot on face* EMOTION! *tight shot on face* Slow fade to black. Scene change. Every conversation between characters is simply switching out giant talking heads. It has all the visual interest and creativity of a daytime soap opera.

You know what? ""Daytime soap opera"" is probably what they were going for when they made this. Which is very unfortunate, given the subject matter. Human trafficking deserves better than this.",1526428800,,2092,4.881690140845071

Mira Sorvino is so stiff sometimes, she is less than unbelievable. Donald Sutherland is not much better. Perhaps it's the script that is so bad they can't make the words flow.
