3845476,3,B0024F13MS,"First and foremost...this is Ministry live.  If you've never seen them (even if you have)...buy it now.  From someone who has seen them live several times, they are unquestionably one of the most intense and aggressive bands in the business.  That said, I was severely disappointed with Adios.  Now...read on.

Ministry and Al Jourgensen have put together only two live tour dvd's: Sphinctour and this release, Adios...Puta Madres.  Beginning with Twitch, The Land of Rape and Honey, The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste and all of the singles in between, I have been a Ministry fan since the beginning - I am 28.  The Sphinctour DVD covered all of those albums.  Songs like Stigmata, Thieves and So What...were brought to life by that world tour dvd.  It was produced (technically by Luxa/Pan) with an incredibly raw attitude and life.  You could watch that dvd and feel as though you were actually there in each location they shot: Paris, Toronto, Los Angeles, Venice, Hamburg, London, et al.  Each song was pounded out in its own improvisational rhythm and time...  Just as it would be in any nightclub or amphitheater.  Songs like ""Crumbs"" and ""Lava"" sounded better live then they did on the album just because the guys kicking it out on stage were giving it their own emotional twist for that particular moment...and it totally made it.

Adios...Puta Madres is not Sphinctour.  In fact it falls way short.  Now, the music is good.  Very good.  Songs like ""Let's go"" and ""Lies Lies Lies"" sound incredible and you are totally sold on the live element.  But...the dvd is shot in basically two places...in basically the same fashion as the tracks you hear on the album.  Having been to several Ministry concerts, I was left feeling totally cheated by what I was watching.  Again, I will never complain about the music, it's incredible.  But the way in which it was presented was anticlimactic given the music that was being played.  It was shot more as a music video...not a live concert.  Of course I don't know, but I have to believe that at least some portion of this has to do with band turnover, which was commonplace with Jourgensen.  Particularly the absence of Paul Barker.  Compared to the emotion and passion with which Sphinctour was created, Adios looks like the warm up act.

Do I recommend this item to Ministry fans?  Abso-freeking-lutely.  Is it as good as Sphinctour?  No F'ing way.  But then again, in my opinion, Ministry's (Jourgensen's) song writing abilities went downhill as their/his political ideoligies increased.  Houses of the Mole was awesome.  Rio Grande Blood...well Senor Peligro is one of the best songs Jourgensen has ever produced.  But The Last Sucker?  C'mon man.  Your political ideals got in the way of an epic career.  With Sympathy, Twitch, The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste, The Land of Rape and Honey, Psalm 69, even The Dark Side of the Spoon (which, in my opinion is their best ever album) are so much better then what they ended with.",1260489600,,2986,4.784313725490196
3845477,5,B0024F13MS,"I have been a fan of Ministrys since ""With Sympathy"" and i grew as they did into harder music. I love the trip as a Ministry fan went on. We went from pop to what became industrial to what became industrial metel to Metel. And this DVD is the final show for us fans. What an amazing show it is. Great choice of songs, thoe i would of liked to seen them try to rework some very early stuff off say ""Twitch"" , just for guys like me that have followed them for so long, but they do do a few oldies and rock out with songs like ""Breath"" and ""stigmata"". Its a great show and great way of saying good by to one of Americas great bands. For me i often wonder if it wasn't for Ministry and wax trax would there be a NIN or KMFDM. Hmmm i kinda doont think so; but who cares we have them and it was a great Ministry ride and the final show is a great testement to there power.
The added bihind the scenes dvd is fun also, to acually see footage of Al at work, even if the work is a bottle of wine. Good studff all around. If your a Ministry fan this is a must. If not well then why are you reading this.",1252281600,4,1093,3.84070796460177
3845478,3,B0024F13MS,"Too bad this double DVD set doesn't include the third track listed on the cover. I'm still waiting !! Oh look, there it is. Hiding on the second half of track #2.
Also, Tony Campos is the percussion monster and it will be a shame to this final lineup hungup for good due to  Grandpa Al's age induced boredom blah, blah, blahh. Check these out if you dare.

3845479,3,B0024F13MS,"As a keen Ministry fan for many years I was hoping to catch them on their final tour. Alas, yet again there wasn't the demand from Australia in order to bring them here. That being the case I was looking forward to catching this DVD in order to get some sense of what I missed...

The result is that Ministry weren't as strong in the end as they once were live despite the release of very good albums after the departure of Paul Barker. The set consists mostly of post-Barker numbers and while they sound good the vibe is not as exciting as the Sphinctour days for example. Sphinctour is more fun.

Having said all that I would recomend the disc for fans of the final three Ministry albums.",1244678400,4,690,4.341085271317829

8350425,2,B0024F13MS,"I love Ministry, I'm a fan of all of their albums, including most of the new ones. This video looks awesome. Unfortunately, while the 12 cameras captured such a dizzying array of shots of the band rocking out, the editors have put them together in an unauthentic-looking blur of edits and cuts, that after two songs you are so dizzy that you don't know what's happening. What I think happened, was that they had four cameras, they let them run through two songs at some point during three different shows, but maybe kept one on Al so that his lips would match the words he's singing on the shots that you see him on, and then just edited everything around. What I'm trying to say is that you're never convinced that the solo you're hearing is the solo that Tommy Victor is playing when he's making googly eyes at the audience, or if it was just taken at some random moment. In fact, some of those googly-eye shots are recycled!! Strangely, the first and last songs are edited to look like music videos a la ""Paradise City"" or something!

The song selection is fantastic, though, and if the music is not too heavily touched up I'd say that they boys do a great job!

The bonus CD is okay, 38 minutes of interviewing, rehearsals, introduction to the crew and support staff and techs, Al tells the story of how he met Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top when their career had been revived (with ""Hot Legs"", as he calls it), and then the boys tell a story of how Ministry's cover of ""What A Wonderful World"" came together. Drummer Aaron raves about what a genius Al is to have come up with that concept... well, I'm not so sure myself, I prefer their version of ""Roadhouse Blues"", but it's still nice that the guys were so into it! ""Getting old is cool... sometimes."" Yeah, right, Al!!

Now I think I'll go watch ""In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up"".",1414540800,,1839,4.4188790560471976

8350431,5,B0024F13MS,"I have been a fan of Ministry since their very first album ""With Sympathy"".  I have every VHS (Live - in case you didn't feel like showing up, Tapes of wrath and Sphinctour).  I would like to see Jourgensen return to his synth pop days and rework classics like ""Effigy"".  This DVD is excellent 5 stars.  I didn't purchase their most recent CD so it gave me a chance to catch up on their new material.  The band is a totally new lineup and Paul Barker is no longer the bass player.  Their music has changed but they are still full of energy and enthusiasm.  Their new lead guitar player is excellent.  My favorite song on the DVD is ""The Last Sucker"".  The DVD is a two disc set with the first backstage interviews.  My only critisism is that Al has turned into a lush and boasts about his drinking and getting plastered at bars.  I guess it is better than being a Heroin addict.  He even spills wine on the equipment during the start of the set.  Al, get even better at your art by joining AA.  You will find there is still a lot more work you can do and this may not be the final world tour.  Al's face is bloated now from alcohol consumption and he smokes cigarettes.  Al please get help!  We want you to stick around for ever.  The DVD I got from Amazon.com came with a personal note from Al indicating the first 4,000 issues are collector's items because of a mistake on the discs which I assume has been corrected now. Highly recommended.",1266019200,,1443,4.2619926199261995
