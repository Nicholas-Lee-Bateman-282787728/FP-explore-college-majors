8167906,5,B000MCZLYQ,"I first saw this movie a long time ago and I was hoping to get the DVD but the VHS is just as good and ""authentic"".

The movie is based around bare knuckle fighting and the winner has the right to face ""the man"" (Jesse Ventura), the top bare knuckle fighter in the country. We meet Bird (Paul Coufos) an aging fighter whose only goal in life is to face ""the man"" and to find the bottom of a bottle.  He meets Casey after saving his life and only finds out later that Casey is a girl (Margaret Langrick).

These two set out to help Bird win as many fights as possible and face ""the man"".  Bird continues to suceed in winning fights and losing his battle against the bottle.

The plot though familiar is interesting and the relationship between these two characters develops from animosity, to friendship and then to love.

The final story line where he fights ""the man"" for all the glory, power and money is truly mano y mano and is not to be missed.

I love it and I watch it as many times as I can.",1183593600,,999,4.171875
