8705910,4,B00UGPUADQ,"Moonstruck is a movie that my husband and I enjoy watching often when it is on TV, so we decided to purchase the Blu-Ray version.  Although the cover of the disc states that a commentary on the Italian family and the music used in the video is included in Special Features, this is not the case.  We still enjoyed the movie, but were disappointed that the Special Features were not available.",1488067200,,392,4.507042253521127
