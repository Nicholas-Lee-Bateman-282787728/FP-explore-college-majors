3819533,5,B001V7YZES,"Series 2 is even better than Series 1--which was fantastic. The episodes are suspenseful mystery, great character dialogue, a 2nd but parallel restaurant scene plot, and a broader implementation of comedy (still more cop than comic or chef though). It all add up to 5 stars, newly improved from gold to platinum.

For newcomers, ""Pie In The Sky"" is the name of the Crabbe restaurant introduced in the first series (see my 5-star review.)

Chef/cop Crabbe (Richard Griffiths) still wants retirement from police investigation in favor of the PIE IN THE SKY restaurant. But blackmailing Police Chief Fisher (Malcolm Sinclair) needs his sometimes odd ways of getting at the facts.  Wife, Margaret (Maggie Steed) is still doing her numbers thing with the restaurant and occasionally assisting with undercover cop work while understanding little about her husband's cuisine.  Beautiful & promoted Det. Sgt. Sophia Cambridge is Crabbe's assigned aide in crime fighting.  More cast is familiar, and the stories are great.  British mystery plus laughs; so what's the down side? All those in-your-face looks at Chef Crabbe's delicious Steak & Kidney Pies without getting even one taste. It is maddening.

10 super episodes, each about 49 minutes, and every one seeming to top the entertainment level of the previous. SUBTITLES available too, we were confused a few times with the British slang, but some new words brought laughs as we deduced their meanings.  Griffiths's bio and cast filmographies complete the bonuses. It's the episodes and food looks that are ""Pie In The Sky"" ""To Die For"" good.

Episodes:
1 HARD CHEESE: Crabbe forced to look into crime of a prowler/thief woman's underpanties. His cheese vendor may be poking around in more places than the Swiss cheese.
2 BROWN BREAD: Title phrase is slang for dead. A lefeless man in the restaurant's restroom is connected to 1/4 million pounds. A crime for Crabbe.
3 POLICEMAN'S DAUGHTER: Fisher's daughter runs away & Crabbe must find her. A disgusting look at Stargazy Pie--golden crust with 8 fish heads protruding.
4 THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY: Did the restaurant's fish supplier murder? Crabbe's wife gets involved fishing for clues.
5 DEAD RIGHT: Kitchen staff increases Crabbe's chicken coop egg production while he looks into threatening notes to a professional medium.
6 BLACK PUDDING: Senility, memoirs, greedy nephew, & kitchen squabbling make for a funny mystery. Senior fun.
7 SWAN IN HIS PRIDE: Fisher forces Crabbe away for investigating a drowning of lady cop while the restaurant kitchen drowns from burst water pipes.
8 THE MILD BUNCH: Crabbe's assigned search for Coverly sisters, aged-con-check bouncers parallels tracking the secret of bread & butter pudding perfection. Delicious episode.
9 MYSTERY OF PIKEY: Teenage Pikey must be caught to end local robberies but the chef is thinking pike as in the fish.
10 LEMON TWIST: Fisher, Cambridge, and Crabbe have a seminar weekend as the restaurant gets a rave newspaper review. Success has it's ups and downs. My wife and my favorite episode.

Fantastic TV British Mystery (Comedy drama) series of several years running. I recommend Series one and Series 2 of PIE IN THE SKY. And will there be another Series on the menu in the future?  I'd bet on it, this is too good to stop with just 2 sets.",1260662400,17,3305,5.056985294117647
3819534,5,B001V7YZES,"If the only thing you've seen Richard Griffiths in is Harry Potter, you're in for a surprise.  The detective/restaurateur character Griffiths plays in ""Pie In The Sky"" is gentle and intelligent - both traits not seen as Harry's uncle.  After watching quite a few of these individual programs on PBS, I was really anxious to get my hands on as many of the stories as I could.  As DI Henry Crabbe, Griffiths is definitely the star, and carries the programs in both, rather different, roles, but the rest of the cast, and it changes through the multiple series, shows a group of characters with more than one dimension.  Part of the drama in the programs is the fact Crabbe wants to retire from the Police force, just be a chef and run his restaurant (named ""Pie In The Sky"").  The program lasted through five series in Britain, so there must have been a lot of viewers.  Unfortunately, it took close to ten years(!) for it to get to the U.S. - at least to my local PBS affiliate.  Too bad, I could have been watching it and buying the DVD's lots sooner.",1259884800,5,1051,4.442708333333333

3819599,4,B001V7YZES,"I have watched two seasons of this show.
The administrator here is blackmailing a very good detective who just wants
to retire and cook very good food in the English gourmet
tradition of steak and kidney pies.
British urban police are as hard pressed by the modern
world as the American, but they face criminals
basically unarmed and unprepared to deal with the mystery of human behavior.
Into this situation our hero makes do and becomes
more than an ordinary policeman.
British police shows are just better acted than American?
Or maybe better written as well?
For me this is so much pleasant entertainment
that I don't fast forward the introductions even...
I say well done!",1378080000,,677,4.844827586206897

3819602,5,B001V7YZES,"This is one of those series you just love to watch over and over. I've purchased the entire collection and each season was a delight. As is not unusual in British shows, the supporting cast help make this the wonderful series it was. My favorite is Henderson and I couldn't imagine anyone else playing his role. I have only one complaint about this show - it's no longer in production. Treat yourself, check out season one and maybe enjoy a little shepards pie while watching (highly recommended).",1332028800,,497,4.724137931034483

3819607,4,B001V7YZES,"This isn't your standard fair of mystery show, in fact it's part resteraunt comedy and part rural detective. The ironic thing is that most of the types of crimes here are what the average copper would face in the rural areas. Lots of petty stuff and no real murder cases (well one episode  does have murder invovled with it but it's not the focus of it). The show is well written and it takes you back to the midninties when this show was filmed.  It's a classy show with Richard Griffiths providing the excellent lead role with warmth and tons of common decency and sense. This show isn't for someone looking for action or mayhem it's more about the standard stuff laced with comedy. This is a detective who is nearing retirement and spends all his free time at the pie in the sky resteraunt and those scenes interlace with his police life in a way that the police station office scenes are very rare.  Making this a mix of a show and it's entertaining and well done but very mild crime wise mostly.  It is mainly about the character of 'crabbe' and his life and interactions more than solving complex crimes.  This show has a laid back feeling to it that reflects most of rural policing too and that's ok.  SO if you are in the mood for this type of copdramedy then you will enjoy this countryfied slice of rural english life.",1284681600,,1328,4.422131147540983
3819608,5,B001V7YZES,"There is nothing like a good English comedy.  This series has excellent actors both male and female.  The Stotylines are very entertaining, very little violence gets the message over so well.  The combination of food and policework is excellent.

3819634,5,B001V7YZES,"My husband and I truly love Pie in the Sky Series 1 and 2.  Delightful in every way.  Our only criticism is that the character actors with the strong or cockney accents, don't speak clearly or slow enoughto be understood properly.  The primary actors are excellent - their acting and diction are perfect.  Humor and mystery are a winning combination with this group as was shown masterfully with Foyle's War.",1267574400,,408,4.785714285714286

3819637,5,B001V7YZES,"""Pie in the Sky Series 2,"" a British mystery television series that happily blends cooking and crime, has been seen only in spotty syndication on public television stations on this side of the pond. The show, made by the British Broadcasting Corporation, is a police procedural/comedy/crime/drama that debuted on BBC1 in the United Kingdom in March 1994 and ran for five series.  So, now comes to us  a generous 3 volume boxed DVD set, comprising ten second season episodes that run approximately 492 minutes. And, among the usual bonuses, subtitles: bless you, Acorn Media. (However, due to the age of the underlying material, you may find small glitches in your product.)

The show stars Richard Griffiths (a Tony-winner on Broadway for ""The History Boys;"" also the film of the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Boys/dp/B000NIVJFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Boys</a>; he's also done&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Equus/dp/B00007KQA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Equus</a>; and is featured in the Harry Potter films). Make no mistake about it, along with his everyman looks, the man can act. I saw him in ""The History Boys"" on Broadway, and his performance certainly rated that Tony. He here plays Detective Inspector Henry Crabbe, an intelligent, sensible, mild-mannered man, who, after 25 years on the force, has lost his hunger for what the job can provide, and is ready to pack it in and open his own restaurant, ""Pie in the Sky."" But the police force isn't ready to let him go. So he bounces back and forth, cooking delectable steak and kidney pies, and solving crimes.

Griffiths receives solid support from Maggie Steed (""Shine on Harvey Moon""), as Margaret, his accountant wife, who's not all that pleased at suddenly finding herself a restaurateur. The rest of the company, led by Malcolm Sinclair (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale-Blu-ray/dp/B000MRA5NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale [Blu-ray</a>] ) as ACC Freddy Fisher, with whom Crabbe supposedly trained, and worked; and Bella Enahoro (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mister-Johnson/dp/6304609574/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mister Johnson</a>) as the particularly charming and lovely D.S. Sophia Cambridge, also turn in excellent performances.  Nor has the BBC stinted on extras; streets and cop shops bustle as they should. Neither has the BBC stinted on location filming.  (The fictional restaurant ""Pie in the Sky,"" was located on the Old Town High Street in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in premises that were then a florist, but have since become a restaurant called ""Pie in the Sky"").

The episodes are: ""Hard Cheese,"" ""Brown Bread,"" ""The Policeman's Daughter,"" ""The One That Got Away,"" ""Dead Right,"" ""Black Pudding,"" ""Swan in His Pride,"" ""The Mild Bunch,"" ""The Mystery of Pikey,"" and ""Lemon Twist.""  The series was created by Andrew Payne, who has also written some of its best, strongest episodes. The mysteries are, by and large, as in the first series, intelligent, surprising, ingenious and original, and the cooking tips are helpful and fun. Mind you, the mysteries are mild: there isn't even a murder in this batch.  There are hardly any car chases; in fact, we never even see Crabbe getting into, or out of a car, let alone running: the shows are evidently carefully crafted to respect his girth, and his dignity.  The shows are therefore quite different from the average run of American cop shows we're accustomed to seeing.  But they are quite entertaining and enjoyable - I like the byplay at the restaurant, and the cop shop, and think we've been missing something flavorful over here.",1262995200,,3788,5.794964028776978
