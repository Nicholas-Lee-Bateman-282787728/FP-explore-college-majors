901625,4,6304609434,"This is an interesting time-capsule of the early 60's. Tony Bill does an excellent job of coloring the time with innocence and uncertain turmoil in this look at that era. It is marvelous to see the early Tim Robbins, John Torturro and Jodie Foster, when they responded to direction with exceptional results. A small neighborhood would have a tight group of kids with some delinquents thrown in. Foster gets pursued by Torturro's demented character and only grabs the attention of Robbins at the last instant. Robbins does such a wonderful job, you believe he is going to be in Mississippi when the lunatic strikes, and that he may not care enough. How much action can pigeons conjure up? At the end, I don't care much about the anticlimax. I just knew that I saw the finest actors of the next generation, for I know that I could have wandered onscreen with any of the three above and had a good time together. I forgive it for unravelling at the end, when it lost its spell. Most of the time it succeeds as a window to '64.",1146960000,3,1023,4.505376344086022
901626,4,6304609434,"Tim Robbins, Jody Foster and John Turtorro. These 3 names alone tell us how well this movie will be performed. All 3 of these fine actors will give 100% to any role they choose to accept. John Turturro plays a loser from Brooklyn straight out of prison for trying to rape Jody Foster. Tim Robbins, a wisened street kid turned civil rights peace activist, saved her from the first attack. Now, with Turturro on the loose, Foster returns to Tim Robbins for support. Good acting with a hint of comedy. 5 star movie, 3 star DVD transfer. It's still worth owning at this price.",1112486400,,572,4.509615384615385
901627,1,6304609434,"I AM RATING THE DIGITAL QUALITY OF THE DVD, NOT THE MOVIE!
The one star is far too much praise for the digital quality of this ""Direct Source Special Products Inc."" brand dvd I've recieved . Far better to get the vhs copy, as this was so obviously dubbed from one, except that they left out all the colour and is so dark it is almost impossible to see! Does anyone know where a quality version of this film can be found on dvd?
I do however like this movie, and was looking forward to seeing it again. It was the first time I had seen Tim Robbins, and John Turturro, and really enjoyed both of their performances.  Particularly Johns portrayal of the sinister Heinz character. I remember it to be a little shakey in its ending but really enjoyed it otherwise.

901691,3,6304609434,"This movie is always related as some underground classic and I always had a moderate interest in seeing it. Primarily due to the fact that Jodie Foster is in it because I love her work so much. But I never got around to watching it until tonight. When it was in the theaters it played at an arthouse cinema near where I lived during that time for months. Anyway I found the film to be extremely unique and original. It was rather an odd mixture of crime drama and rough comedy. The comedy is more in line with something like American Graffiti rather than directly obvious comedy. Its more like off kilter comedy in the style of John Waters sort of. Some weird characters doing odd things territory. But the real gem in this particular film is not Foster or Robbins, but rather John Tuturro who is always great in everything he does. Here is some of his finest work. His psychotic portrait of a killer is pretty astonishing. He carries the ball. Foster is great as usual but this role is a classic damsel in distress one that doesnt require a lot of an actor. She does what she can with a rather undemanding role. Over all I expected a lot more from a film considered by many to be a minor classic. Its a decent film that pre-dates the Coen brothers films, and must have been an inspiration for them, especially being that this film has a similar feel to several coen films, and the fact that Tuturro is in this movie and several Coen bros. films. This seems to be a clear indicator that the Coens liked this film. I thought it was good but in a mediocre way.",1367712000,,1558,4.339041095890411

I think Jodi Foster was very good, especially in bringing subtleties into primary focus.

Tim Robbins is good but doesn't come close to his performance as the ultra right wing senatorial candidate in BOB ROBERT's in which is is GREAT !",1353715200,,449,4.463414634146342

901696,5,6304609434,"The time of this film is the mid 60s.  In real life, this was prime time for me.  Lots happening that the movie brought back with a vengeance.  I was never lower middle class, but much of my milieu was.  If real-life recollection means anything, this flick caught it in spades.  Not everything that happened hung together, which is how life REALLY unfolds.  Lots of unhung-together stuff happens, and your awareness gets pulled all around from thing to thing.  Only thing that's consistent is that it's all happening to you.

  Of course, not everybody lives a complex life--particularly not one where their awareness must skip from one realm to an unconnected other realm.  But back then mine was indeed like that.  I lived a lot of things, in many different circles, all occurring quite suddenly in close temporal proximity to each other.  When that happens, just living becomes very stressful.  Most people blink out the temporaneously incongruent . . . give themselves the illusion that things happen in a unified stream of events . . . unwanted intrusions from incongruent events just don't seem to be there in their awareness and recollections to interfere with each other.  For example, all their friends are white, of the same class, in a perpetually congruent cultural context (they don't even see the black cop directing traffic, the Hispanic busboy, the Chinese English professor with a thick accent, the gay barber).  But if you travel eyes-wide-open in a lot of circles that typically exclude each other, these circles will intersect in more accidental than thematically coherent schedules of bumping into each other.  Like a couple of hours in the bumper cars.  Nobody in the other bumper cars has any specific designs on bumping you off your course.  They've each got their own thing in mind, and the bumper happens in an accidental time/logic of its own.  If you value every experience-- like if you were to value every bump in the bumper cars-- you start to feel constantly distracted.  But over enough time and sufficient events, the whole starts to make some kind of for-the-moment sense-- while all the time random events take place all around you.

  So, here's Tim Robbins--playing a white deceased cop's son who feels he might have stumbled (through hearing a Martin Luther King speech at an accidentally extra-propitious moment in his life) into actual enactment of a philosophy of love rather than boundaries-defining hate--trying to hold together several divergent currents in his life (some for which he had a past, others quite new).  The bumper car temporality of it all for sure makes this movie.  We see working class/lower middle class Carroll O'Connor ALL IN THE FAMILY life, with its penchant for ignoring things right under the nose that might make one more uncomfortable than one already is, displayed in all its famed insensitivity to otherness.  A plainclothes cop on stakeout dies horribly and insignificantly inside a street phone booth crashed into with great disregard by the villain's car running into it in a bad version of emergency parking-- and when a uniformed cop is asked by a sleepy detective where the stakeout is, the uniform says carelessly (while pointing to the underneath of the car), ""He's under there.""  No spirit of funeral ceremony for the thin blue line.  Only the working class penchant for seeing self and others in terms of things that things unexplicably happen TO--a defensively blase attitude which careful research has shown causes cops to get into so much trouble when trying to handle the complexities of emotional events and interpersonal conflicts.

  This is what Tim Robbins is trying to grow beyond as much as he can--and the course of the plot sets some harsh parameters regarding how far Tim is ever going to be allowed to get in this effort.  In the middle of this high drama, some kid gets back with his girlfriend at the mention of their some day having kids together (totally unaware of the drama involved in the car that almost ran into a high-speed head-on crash into the car he and his girl are in), and the movie ends with a Black guy who had an intolerant encounter with Tim in the dinner probably coming to Tim's house to tell him (after all that happened right here in the Bronx) that he has been accepted to go to Mississippi.

  What I'm trying to get at here is the suggestion that WHAT THIS FILM LOSES IN THEATRICAL COHERENCE IT GAINS IN REAL-LIFE DISPARATE FLOW.  As a psychotherapist doing a lot of professional in-service training and supervision, I object strongly to the use of films to portray mental illness.  Theatrical drama-logic requires a degree of plot evolution coherence and motivational reasonableness that are simply missing in genuine diagnoses of mental illness-- in fact, such fragmentation is often the point of mental illness.  In the case of this film, however, I immediately purchased it for use in showing how the progression of real life wily nily sweeps together otherwise disparate flows of events.  And I'm not using this to raise the consciousness of one-to-one psychotherapists, but of social workers who must do the magic of therapy on the run, in context, while catching life in real time out in the field (as opposed to in the comfort of a make-believe life milieu of the office).  I started my career doing street gang work in the then murderous New York City Lower East Side at around the time this movie depicts, so the memories aroused in me by this film are hardly just theoretical.

  As a European immigrant, I find myself enjoying more and more PBS travel shows (like Rick Steve's 30 minutes travel pieces through Europe).  So I can't help wondering if a movie like this one doesn't require a travel guide for even the experienced to fully appreciate.  That doesn't mean a movie critic (for whom I have only the greatest respect and appreciation), but someone who has lived the sort of life processes reflected in this film, and who has had to reflect on that living through to some depth.

Alas, the logic by which I give this gem five stars may seem quarky to some, so I'd very much like to hear what you think--AFTER you buy and look closely at this much underappreciated film, of course.",1311120000,,6226,4.841209829867675
901697,5,6304609434,"Which I know is damning with faint praise, given he also directed Flyboys, but bear with me: this is American Graffiti the Darkside: it's set in the Bronx, not Southern California, and instead of downing milkshakes, the Lavern and Shirley-like chicks are huffing glue in the back seat of a Pontiac.  Even when it goes a little over the top here and there, it always redeems itself with a black joke.  ""Where's the stake out?"" asks one cop.  ""Under that mess"", indicates another, pointing to the dead cop's body under a car.  With its sense of doom coming from the civil rights struggle of 1964, when the film is set, the story has more weight than Graffiti, which used Vietnam to similar effect, but not with the same gravity.  The dialog by John Patrick Shanley is poetry in de's, dem's and dose, and the direction, unfortunately, turned out to be Tony Bill's crowning achievement.  Before it came the very good My Bodyguard; afterward came Crazy People -- as cutesy as it is, it actually foreshadows irony in advertising by two decades! -- Untamed Heart, A Home of Our Own, you see where I'm going ...",1296864000,6,1103,4.630769230769231
901698,4,6304609434,"A quirky independent film with a strong cast, Five Corners mixes light touches and the very serious in unpredictable ways.  The main action takes place over a couple days in the Bronx in 1964.  John Turturro returns to his neighborhood with pent-up anger, particularly against Jodie Foster, the timid victim of the attempted rape that sent him to prison.  Tim Robbins was her savior then, now only interested in preparing to become a civil rights freedom rider.  Todd Graff is her willing but ineffectual boyfriend, crippled trying to stop the attempted rape.  As Turturro tries to reestablish contact with Foster, she seeks Robbins' protection while trying to keep her boyfriend from getting hurt again.  A subplot involves a couple out-of-control women and a couple mischief-making men who provide some comic relief and more.  And there are penguins and mysterious bow and arrow shootings.  There is a slightly surreal edge, and a peculiar usage of the famous duet from Delibes' Lakme.

Though very much its own thing, the nostalgia and offbeat mood reminded me of American Graffiti and Diner at times.  The acting and rich dramatic texture drew me in so that I was willing to follow the odd turns without complaint.  Turturro is particularly impressive.  Unlike some, I didn't think the film fell apart at the end, which made as much sense as the rest and had some strong dramatic content.  Very much worth seeing.

Not too much of a spoiler alert, i hope, because there is so much more.",1435363200,,850,4.220858895705521

7874753,4,6304609434,"What a strange little film ""Five Corners"" is! Despite matricide, multiple homicides, even a penguicide (if that is what clubbing a penguin to death is called, though rest assured that, happily, one of two adorable penguins survives), and some additional near-fatalities among the humans are averted, this movie is quirky and even funny in spots in an off-kilter sort of way. It provides glimpses of early 1960s life, archery as practised in such an urban setting, musical styles, crime, the civil rights movement of those years, novel ways of vertically traversing an elevator shaft, and, more generally, working class culture in a New York City borough (the Bronx), that are all its own. The ingredients of this thriller mix together in ever-surprising ways.

There are no subtitles on the edition viewed (Alliance DVD 113390, which can be enjoyed in English or in French) nor are there any special features.",1401408000,,909,5.100671140939597
7874754,5,6304609434,"Five Corners is a movie that is not to be missed. The screenplay is by the Oscar-winning Screenwriter of ""Moonstruck"", and writer-director of ""Doubt"", John Patrick Shanley. Shanley has a keen ear for language, and some of the quirkiness and idiosyncrasies of the characters in ""Moonstruck"" is found in some of the characters here as well. The film opens to the sound of the Beatles' ""In My Life"", but the film uses 1960's music sparingly, unlike some movies from the same period.

The movie stars two-time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster, before she won her first Oscar, in a fine performance, complete with a flawless Bronx accent. Several other actors who were not as well known when the film was released also appear, most notably, John Turturro, who is excellent as the film's villain, and Academy Award Winner, actor-director Tim Robbins, as a civil rights activist who has renounced violence. Elizabeth Berridge, best known as Mozart's long-suffering wife in ""Amadeus"", also stars as the glue-sniffing girlfriend of a guy who ""lets"" a couple of young students take her and her best friend, and they take both girls for a ride, literally, that they will never forget!

The plot combines real life situations, specifically, the Civil Rights movement and the violence that occurred in Mississippi during the Civil Rights struggle, with fictional situations for the film's 1964 setting. The art direction and set decoration and the period details are impeccable.  You really do feel you are in New York City in 1964. ""Five Corners"" is both a social commentary and a funny, slice-of-life look at New York City in 1964, with not quite expected plot twists and at least one running joke that I will not reveal.

At times wickedly funny and always interesting to watch, ""Five Corners"" is a definite must-see. A truly independent film (produced by George Harrison's now defunct Handmade Films) and a quirky little gem. Don't miss it!!",1400630400,4,1933,5.012461059190031

Hey wouldn't that be a hoot since the quality of the discs vary so much!!!!

The original DVD from Critic's Picks looks like it was copied from a VHS tape (not wide screen).

My laser disc is wide screen and much better quality.

I hear the Blu-ray is pretty good with some minor grain; this is the one to buy.

I wish Amazon could figure it out........",1395705600,,458,4.404761904761905
