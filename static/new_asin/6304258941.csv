824778,5,6304258941,"When Bruce put his two DVDs out I had to run out and buy a DVD player so I could view them.  They are still the only two DVDs I own and it was well worth the $200 for the DVD player!  All of us Bruce fans know that he NEVER disappoints us...This will make you feel like you are right in the room with Bruce, Patti and the guys as they record ""Blood Brothers"".  This is a must have for your collection!
By the way - today happens to be his birthday (Happy 52 Bruce!)",1001203200,5,465,3.8229166666666665
824779,5,6304258941,"A superb documentary. Even if you're not a big Springsteen fan, this is a great insude look at how an album is put together in the studio. A must have.
Unfortunately, it looks like the DVD has no additional features that aren't already on VHS, so you might as well buy the videotape.",1000598400,2,283,4.3584905660377355
824780,5,6304258941,"Since it was nearly seven years since the last time the E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen played together during the Tunnel of Love and the Amnesty International tours, their coming together in 1995 was a fans dream.

 The band members had become more adept at playing their instruments, they had matured some, and it comes out in the numerous renditions of Blood Brothers and Secret Garden (which would be later used in the movie Jerry Maguire) that we get to eavesdrop on like a fly on the wall in the studio.

The E Streeters do an awesome job with Murder Incorporated, a song they'd used for years in concerts, just had never released on an album before.

And when they finally get to This Hard Land, it's Springsteen at his purist; no politics, no agenda, just people and good hard rock and roll.

As a fan I'd cheer the Boss if he did nothing more than sit in a chair with an acoustic guitar and sing for an hour, but what you've got here is 90 minutes worth of behind the scenes goings on, and it's well worth the money.

 And if you never have, make sure you go to a concert if you ever have the chance. You'll never forget it.",980380800,46,1137,4.309859154929577
824781,5,6304258941,"...and will be buying the DVD the moment it hits the stands.
The only knock against this film could be that it does not show the way Bruce Springsteen normally records, meaning that he is spending months in the studio recording eight songs for every one he releases.  Then again, he hasn't recorded in the ""normal"" way for him since the Born in the U.S.A. sessions in the early '80s and only Ken Burns could make a documentary about a ""typical"" Springsteen recording session.
The VHS tape version is still worth the money, unless they are including the same 5-song CD with the DVD, too.  Buy the tape, keep the CD and give the VHS to a relative for their birthday.",978393600,6,664,4.479338842975206
824782,5,6304258941,"I really love this video for all sorts of reasons really. First of all Bruce is filmed doing all sorts of things from eating out of a jar of peanut butter to singing to his kids. Patti and the rest of the band do  some talking as well. Its so nice to learn about the ""behind the  sceens"" that happens that no one really gets to hear about and this  video shows that. Executive producer Jon Landau knows the boss inside and  out. He has certainly captured a side of Bruce that proves him to be down  to earth and a regular family kind of guy.",959212800,9,541,4.066037735849057
824783,5,6304258941,"This video is a behind-the-scenes look in the recording studio for the Greatest Hits album. Bruce and the E Street Band have just re-united, and  meet in the studio to record three new tracks to add to the CD --  Murder,  Incorporated; This Hard Land; and Blood Brothers.

825029,5,6304258941,"What can I say?  I saw him and his band in concert many times, and the first time was in 1978, or there about, when his first hit 'Rosalita' climbed straight up the music charts to #1!  I was one of the fortunate people in the crowd, at one of his first big concerts in the beginning, when he sang 'Rosalita' and changed the lyrics in 'Rosalita' toward the end of the song with 'and my record, baby, just came in at number one!' His fans didn't even know it yet!  I can still remember the goosebumps after he finished singing the improvised ending of 'Rosalita'! I am 51 years young today, and saw him in concert before his first band member passed away, Danny Federicia, a few years ago, and I can honestly say that I have no regrets, and never had any, from going to one of his shows, with especially his E Street band!  He has never disappointed me, and neither has his incredible band!  But I feel this about every single album that he came out with, as I have all!",1402272000,,969,4.216216216216216

825033,5,6304258941,"This was really fun!  Bruce calls the band back together after a decade apart, and all show up with about 2-3 days notice to jam out in the studio; it's a real party, and cool to see some of the production side of making an album.  Lots of input from Jon Landau, Bob Clearmountain and Chuck Plotkin.  Keeps me entertained on my treadmill.",1380067200,,338,4.333333333333333

825155,4,6304258941,"Blood brothers has some priceless moments such as when Bruce's manager tells him they can finish a track tomorrow and Bruce tells him that he is going to see Beauty and the Beast tomorrow with his kids.  Look for a red headed Soozie Tyrell working on back up vocals with friends Patti Scialfa and Lisa Lowell while the Springsteen kids are playing in the studio.  Another reason to buy this DVD is Bruce recording Back in Her Arms Again.  So awesome!  But, some of the scenes of the reunited E Streeters seem awkward and uncomfortable.",1370476800,,535,4.6

825159,5,6304258941,"'Blood Brothers' is the excellent documentary showing the reunion of the E Street Band after 11 years apart and their recording of some additional tracks for Bruce's greatest hits album. Not only do I love the songs being recorded, but it is amazing to see them being performed and developed and the dynamic between all of the band members. You also get to see the music video recording for 'Murder Incorporated' which makes for a wonderful live performance and you can see just how much it means to all the fans and production crew there. This is the best place to go for an insight into Bruce when he is recording and to see how a song grows over subsequent takes and with band collaboration. This may be short, at just under 80 minutes, but it makes for riveting and inspiring viewing. Highly recommended for all fans of the boss.

Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",1296345600,,904,4.4787878787878785
825160,4,6304258941,"This was a very good look at a band that clearly are friends. The dynamics in the studio are amazingly loose. Clearly Bruce had it worked out in his mind but let the band members bring their own creativity to the process.

They had not been in the studio in years yet were able to bring it together in what appeared to be fairly quickly.

The depth of feeling between band members was obvious and felt real.

Very enjoyable and some great music.",1152057600,,445,4.337349397590361
825161,5,6304258941,"This DVD is exactly what I hoped it'd be.  Intimate.

Tender.  Gritty.  Real.  Getting to see the band together

again, the nervousness, the ease with which they get

back into the groove is great.  Having a window into

these moments is priceless.  It's the closest I'll ever

get to the band I'm sure, and I'm grateful they allowed

us this glimpse into their lives, the band, and the

process of recording.  There were a few moments

when the emotion of the songs and their collective

delivery, reduced me to tears.  One special moment

to me is when they celebrated Clarence's birthday

at the studio.  That's good stuff.  Worth every

penny.  There's no way to recommend it highly

enough, to old fans or new!",1108339200,7,715,4.626016260162602
825162,5,6304258941,"This a nice little edition to my collection of Bruce films. I bought this the day it came out, very good and very insightful on how the songs are created. Bruce just comes into the room and starts playing the songs while the other guys are taking notes, its like a classroom on how to build a song. Its like Bruce wants them to find a way to make the song sound good with there ideas.... hes very generous in that way...I thought it was cool the way he treated the gentlemen with the version of Secret Garden with the strings on it, he treated him decently even though that pompus idiot Bob Clearmountian didn't like it, glad he was outvoted...I personally liked the strings version myself...anyways buy this , you will like it....",1077235200,,731,4.462686567164179
825163,5,6304258941,"This is a great DVD not only for the Bruce fan, but for anyone who is interested in how records are made. This DVD takes you right inside the studio like no other documentary I've ever seen, from Bruce showing the guys the songs on his acoustic guitar, right down to the tracking and shooting of the video. You'll not only hear from Bruce but from all the members of the E-Street band, the producers and the engineers, as to what it's like to work with him.
There are plenty of classic studio ""spinal tap"" moments, including Bruce chattering on for five minutes in complete nonsense about the ""narrative"" of the record and if the new string part on ""Secret Garden"" interfered with the narrative, they shouldn't use it...""so let that be your guide,"" and then walks out leaving them in absolute confusion. And then there's Clarence Clemens' melodramatic about the ""melodies that were written millions of eons ago"" that he's just going to snatch out of the air.
This is a very entertaining DVD for all lovers of music. Highly recommended",1077062400,2,1034,4.686813186813187
825164,5,6304258941,"This is a documentary filmed over 7 days, which was the total time that the band came together to put together their Greatest Hits CD. The whirlwind project entailed recording 4 songs in the studio, taping a live performance of ""Blood Brothers"" for a music video, choosing which previously recorded tracks to include, taking still photographs for promotion and many other decisions. You will see footage containing debate about which cover photograph to pick, which songs should be on the CD or not, including entertaining a ghastly suggestion to leave  ""Thunder Road"" off to make more space for other songs! This is basically a reality show about a slice of the life of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Well back in 1995 when this was made we called these documentaries but now that it is 2002 and we are deluged with reality shows I'd liken this more to a reality show than a documentary!
If you are interested in what really goes on during a studio taping and mixing of music, and about behind the scenes decisions, you will love this. People interested in the business end of the entertainment industry will enjoy seeing the interaction between the producer and the manager and the musicians. If you are a big fan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band you will love it, of course, that goes without saying.
I am not a musician and am ignorant about the process of making music, but this movie gave me some insight. We see Bruce telling the band what his vision for the songs is, how he wants the mood, his raw ideas, and then the feedback of the musicians and the businessmen. We see discussion of whether the music is overpowering the lyrics, whether the music is really setting the tone of the message of the song, etc. We see the band members composing their own parts to the songs. We hear debate about which version of the song is the best, which invokes the proper mood and message. We see a meeting with an outside consultant who remixed ""Secret Garden"" with some string instruments and we see the band vote for their favorite version (it is not unanimous). We see Bruce tired and working hard, and in one scene he looks as if he just woke up from a nap with ""bed head"". We see them out on the streets with fans calling their names and asking for autographs and asking Bruce for a kiss on the cheek (which was refused).
Springsteen brought up the Greatest Hits project idea on a Thursday and recording began a few days later. The whole project was done in a week. What a whirlwind. Because this was the first time the band had officially studio-recorded in 11 years, and 7 years since performing together, there were some interesting dynamics going on and band members were commenting about their emotions and happiness at being together again.
After watching this I have more respect for musicians than I used to. As a consumer and listener of the final product I hadn't really been exposed to all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes. It is apparent throughout the film that Bruce, the band, the other artists and the business people worked very well together but still I could appreciate the hard work and difficulty of it all. As with other types of projects, there is the dream and the original conception, there is the path along the way where others give input, compromise is made, different things are tried, and one final thing results, which does not always please everyone. The looming deadline is there and impacts the project.
I also was left completely in awe of all it takes to write great lyrics, to compose music, and then to get it to the end product. This film helped me realize just a slice of what goes on behind the scenes and to appreciate all it takes to put out a studio recording. What talent each musician must have to be able to do this work! I was left with the feeling that to be musical, it is an inborn talent not something that is easily learned. I also realized the true dedication of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band. It was very clear to me that Springsteen cannot help but write and perform, it is in his blood, it is a calling, it comes natural and it cannot be suppressed. Musicians must make music, writers must write, you cannot stop them! And to Bruce and the E Street Band I beg: ""Don't stop!""
My one complaint was the spoken part of the track seems to be a lower volume than the music. I was straining to hear some of the mumblings and fast-talking and then when the music came on it was blasting! As I watched it I took out my copy of the Greatest Hits CD and compared it with the final songs that made the cut, the photograph of the band we saw being shot, and one inside shot was a proposed cover, which was shot down. And of course as a huge fan I wished the film were longer, and that I could have such a bird's eye view of their work process more often!",1041033600,53,4842,4.452702702702703
