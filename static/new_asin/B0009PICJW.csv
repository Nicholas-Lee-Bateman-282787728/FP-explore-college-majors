8064750,4,B0009PICJW,I remembered seeing this movie so many years ago and was surprised it was even available. I felt it was more of a comedy than anything. Sonia Braga is a talented actress and it was surprising to see how much younger she looked back then. I would have preferred to have it on DVD but the price for VHS was so much lower.,1185926400,,319,4.079365079365079
8064751,3,B0009PICJW,"This is an erotic film starring the beautiful Sonia Braga, a.k.a. the Brazilian Marilyn Monroe.

The dialogue is horrible and the plot is asinine. Braga plays a nymphomaniac who hits on guys while riding a public bus. Braga and her studs wind up ""doing it"" everywhere--under an open sewer pipe, in the backs of cars, various assorted public areas, etc.

The dialogue is so bad it provokes uproarious (yet unintended) laughter. However, Braga is very beautiful. The bad dialogue and the opportunity to see Braga in various states of undress make this movie worth a look.

Those who wish to see Braga in a much better role should check out ""Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands."" As Dona Flor, Braga is able to display both her beauty and acting ability in a much more satisfactory way.",1177891200,6,778,4.705882352941177
