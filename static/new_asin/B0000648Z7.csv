7960942,4,B0000648Z7,"I can't review this movie based on the DVD format because I didn't purchase it from here. But I did watch it due to the movie being acclaimed.
This movie fits the genres of action, crime, and horror. I believe I watched the cut version, which was more mild compared to the uncut version. In the cut version, every time strong language is said, it's bleeped out. Regardless, the movie is still quite dark and gritty. This movie is part of Hong Kong Category III list with good reason. The movie was actually not as gory as I expected. But don't get me wrong, there are some gruesome parts. In fact, there was a scene in which Serial Killer Lam Gor-Yu surgically removed the breast of his deceased victim by using a scalpel and there is a scene in which he implores in necrophilia. There wasn't much blood in the film though.

The movie was made in 1992 and directed by Danny Lee and Billy Tang. The movie depicts the police investigation and apprehension of the murderer, the interrogation of the apprehended, and the retelling of the crime through flashbacks. Serial Killer Lam Gor-Yu was played by Simon Yan, who gave an excellent performance. He was genuinely creepy and he was acting was just perfect. He was able to switch from being polite and quiet to a howling serial killer unable to control his urges. On rainy night, he prowls the street in his taxi, trying to find his victims. His victims are people he considers to be 'bad' women. They are mainly prostitutes and addicts, which he correlates them to due to his traumatic and horrible childhood. After he finds his victim, he strangles, dismembers and then photographs them in an attempt to clean and purify the streets.

The police uses brutal tactics to try to extract a confession from him (i.e. beating him). It wasn't until the police showed explicit photographs of his young niece that he confessed to the crimes. He confesses his penchant  for necrophilia, cannibalism, and taking photographs of the women's dismembered bodies as a souvenir.

The movie is supposedly based on a true story. The movie is meant to portray a true crime that occurred in Hong Kong. In 1982, serial killer Lam Kor-wan or 'The Jars Murderer' was arrested for the murder of four women. The movie and the history of Lam Kor-wan align pretty well based on what I could find. I couldn't find extensive information about him, even though he is pretty infamous for his horrid crimes. Lam Kor-wan did murder his victims in the back seat of his taxi. He would proceed to drag the bodies to his small apartment, mutilate them with an electric saw and put their organs into jars containing formaldehyde.

When I finished watching the movie, I had mixed feelings, which is why I'm unsure whether or not to give 3 stars or 4 stars. But after giving it much thought, I think this movie is worthy of 4 stars as the acting, music, and the direction of the film was great. However, I would not suggest this movie to people who do not like gory movies. If you do watch the movie, keep in mind there may be things you consider to be obscene. Also, this was the first Hong Kong Category III that I've watched, which might be why my rating is more generous.",1440115200,,3183,4.577192982456141
7960943,4,B0000648Z7,"DVD Review: I can only hope one day someone like Diskotec, Synapse or Vinegar Syndrome will release this movie in the USA UNCUT and UNCENSORED! For now the Tai Seng version will suffice. The copy I received is the actual Tai Seng release that has the cover with Simon Yam on the front with his finger over his mouth with grotesque s*** on a table but the DVD is from Winson Entertainment. I don't know if that is what it is but eh! The audio is a bit crappy as these beeping sounds keep occurring on the Cantonese language but Mandarin isn't. The picture quality is a little fuzzy but it's overall fine. And it's not properly formatted for Widescreen TV's (smaller picture) and the subtitles are in British English. Bloody wanker.

Movie Review: Some people say this movie is a gorefest. I don't know what is considered a gorefest in their thoughts, but all I know it isn't really gory at all. There is a couple of scenes which we get to see jiggly severed boobs and some blood splatter but it's sure as s*** not a gorefest. Morons. Anyways, I loved this movie. Though it's not the splatter movie I was hoping for (because of the b***f***ing censors more likely), it's still a wonderful and disturbing movie based on an actual serial killer who strangled and dismembered 4 broads in the early 80's and even engaged in necrophilia with one of them. At times the tone is inconsistent to which at times the film has heavy drama and horror then out of no where adds a slapstick comedic scene (huh?) and the pacing is a little slow. But the acting was really great, the horror elements were so disturbingly well done that it didn't really need gore s*** but whatever.

Conclusion: 3 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 for Dr. Lamb",1429228800,,1718,4.468152866242038
7960944,5,B0000648Z7,"Great movie, was excited to receive it so quickly. everything I hoped for. I look forward to seeing what films they'll make available next!",1390780800,,139,4.833333333333333
7960945,3,B0000648Z7,"The next year after Dr. Lamb Danny Lee as a director shot The Untold Story which came out to be a bit better than Dr. Lamb and became somewhat classic in the circles of gorehounds and category III movie lovers. But in Dr. Lamb some elements can be found that later made The Untold Story so popular.

In the beginning of Dr. Lamb police arrest a taxi driver accusing him in a number of girl murders throughout Hong Kong. Young man doesn't want to confess at first, but finally starts telling his story, and we see the rest of the film as a flashback. Dr. Lamb is pretty gory, with notorious episodes for example of woman's breast being cut off or chunks of human meat floating in a fish tank, although with nothing overly-disturbing which can shock those who's seen plenty of such movies. And altogether Dr. Lamb could become totally senseless and stupid exploitation schlock like, say Ebola Syndrome, but it didn't.

Danny Lee turned this gorefest into a pretty serious film. I wouldn't call it a drama, but it definately is much more than your ordinary splatter movie. As The Untold Story makes a sudden turn after the cannibal is seized, Dr. Lamb keeps it realistic from the very beginning. We see the taxi driver's family which doesn't want to believe that their relative is guilty, but as soon as he confesses they all turn their backs on him. We see this guy being interrogated in a police precinct and how cops - calling a spade a spade - torture him to get a confession. At this moment you don't even know whom to feel for - cops or a murderer. Dr. Lamb at many points turns out to be pretty ambiguous and thoughtful albeit it doesn't necessarily have to. It strongly reminded me of William Lustig's Maniac. This is the case when an exploitation film happens to be something more, and that's always a nice surprise for a viewer.",1172707200,4,1835,4.524096385542169
7960946,2,B0000648Z7,"Here is another entry that many fans of Asian cinema promised me would deliver the goods in the gore department. This title often appears in the same breath with ""The Untold Story"" and ""Ebola Syndrome,"" good, gory movies sure to induce a burning sensation in the pit of your stomach. ""Dr. Lamb"" is part of the grand tradition of the notorious Category III Hong Kong stomach churners. Since I have not seen newer entries in this particularly revolting sub genre, I assume that with the Chinese acquisition of Hong Kong from the British a few years ago these sorts of movies have gone the way of the dinosaur. After watching ""Dr. Lamb,"" I am almost relieved to see the end of these types of films. Not because the majority of them are bad, not at all. ""The Untold Story"" was a wonderful, morally redemptive tale of transcendental spiritual values expressed through the preparation and consumption of human meat patties. No, I applaud the end of Category III because ""Dr. Lamb"" is such a boring, atrocious mess of a movie. This one is dullsville all the way, folks, and is best left in the nearest trash receptacle. I feel cheated of the nearly two hours I spent watching this piece of crud.
Dr. Lamb is really Lam Gor-Yu, a taxi driver with the most unusual proclivities. The beginning of the film shows us why he has so many problems adjusting to reality. His father spoiled the boy incessantly from the earliest years of the child's life, refusing to scold him for questionable behaviors directed at the other kids in the apartment building or towards family members. It is just a part of growing up, argues the elder Lam, to express a curiosity for girls and the young women dad brings home. That a social worker would probably think otherwise never impresses itself on this father's mind. These seeds of degeneracy blossom fully once Lam Gor-Yu attains manhood. He does not leave the house to seek his own destiny, but maintains a room in his father's home that he shares with one of his brothers. Only when the men in the family leave to earn their daily bread does Lam Gor-Yu express fully his grotesque desires, first with a few female relatives and later with women he meets on the streets of the city. The police step into the picture when a photo development laboratory brings in some pictures of a dismembered body left by a customer. That a calculating killer like Lam Gor-Yu would do such a stupid thing is only the first salvo of idiocy fired in this clunker.
The cops, with Inspector Lee at the helm, begin to search for the man who dropped off the negatives. When they get him, which does not take long, the police proceed to torture the suspect in ways that would cause the entire staff of the ACLU to have a fit. The police officers beat Lam Gor-Yu with a phone book, slap him around, and generally do anything they think will get them that valuable confession. The killer stays mum despite the atrocities, refusing to give the investigators the satisfaction of breaking him. Drastic situations call for drastic solutions, so Lee brings in the man's family and tells them what Lam Gor-Yu did to his niece. Then the family proceeds to beat the killer senseless while the cops watch closely for any signs of a willingness to confess. Well, Lam does confess to the heinous crimes, all of which we see in flashback. What did the killer do? Abduct woman and murder them in his apartment. That is all, with a few sick scenes of the cops searching the apartment for ""evidence"" and other crime scene reenactments thrown in for balance. ""Dr. Lamb"" is a tasteless film, but it is also an incredibly boring one with much less sauce than ""The Untold Story"" or similar Hong Kong masterpieces.
""Dr. Lamb"" initially promises great things. It has Simon Yam as the psycho and Danny Lee sleepwalking through yet another role as a police investigator. I keep telling myself that the DVD version I watched underwent some massive cuts because the gore just isn't there. You do get to see Lam Gor-Yu perform homemade surgery on his victims, a little blood spatter here and there, but this does not compare to the gross out effects seen in other genre entries. The other elements you would expect from a film from this genre are here: the usual bad taste humor, experienced full force when the cops search Lam Gor-Yu's apartment and engage in some gluey slapstick sequences, is as upsetting as it was in ""Untold Story."" The emphasis on police procedures--meaning no access to a lawyer and unending interrogations filled with brutality--dominates a portion of the film, something that probably won't improve now that communist Chinese cops walk the streets.
The only positives in ""Dr. Lamb"" are the soundtrack and the cinematography, but even then some of the scenes inside the taxicab on the rain slicked streets of Hong Kong run on. The DVD's picture quality was atrocious, full of haze and color bleeding during the scenes when clarity mattered the most. I have seen a few reviews from people who label this film as one of the ghastliest pieces of cinema ever to emerge from the Orient, but I did not see it. Maybe I watched some obscure DVD version of the film that left out all the grue, but the movie I saw and the one other people describe is as wide as the gulf separating the earth and the moon. Give this one a shot if you like Asian cinema; perhaps you will have a better experience than I had with it.",1074384000,,5405,4.63125
7960947,3,B0000648Z7,"I'm not sure whether the version I saw is the full uncut version but it's Cat III and purchased on DVD in Hong Kong itself. Being a gorehound, and using other Hong Kong fare such as ""The Ebola Syndrome"", ""Prostitute Killer"" and ""The Untold Story"" (amongst others) as benchmarks, ""Dr Lamb"" is rather mild. Typical of the HK formula at the time, where the film is really about flashbacks as the killer confesses to his crimes, ""Dr Lamb"" is only marginally violent considering the modus operandi of the killer (dismemberment). Very few (and brief) close ups of the sordid violence, only the sprayed blood gives any indication of what actually went on. Story has a good premise (that weirdos are the result of what happened to them during childhood) but that's about it. In short, the film could have upped its ante but it didn't.",1039824000,,826,4.703448275862069
7960948,1,B0000648Z7,"Simon Yam Tat-Wah portrays the title character (not a doctor), an insane maniac who does things to women (living and dead) that are better left undescribed.  This early 1990s movie is an ""infamous"" Category III title from Hong Kong.  Danny Lee (the prototypical ""cop"" from tons of HK cop and triad flicks) plays the inspector in charge of solving the case and getting a confession (i.e., beating the suspect up until he confesses).
I don't like the idea of labeling anything as ""sick"" or ""twisted,"" but if I were to, this would be the movie about which to use those terms (and I've seen and can easily stomach a lot of these Category III flicks).
What can one say about this movie?  I'd put this one in the ""has to be seen to be believed"" category, but then that might be seen as a recommendation, and I can't recommend this one.
If you dislike violence and nudity thrown together, avoid this at all costs.  If you think jokes about severed bodily parts are in poor taste, feel free to pass.  However, if you are a fan of HK Category III movies, don't mind gore, extreme violence toward women, have enjoyed HK police procedurals/confession beating stories, and like Simon Yam and/or Danny Lee, well, how can I stop you?  Up there with ""The Untold Story"" for least-likely HK movie that I would re-visit.",1019692800,5,1302,4.5905172413793105
