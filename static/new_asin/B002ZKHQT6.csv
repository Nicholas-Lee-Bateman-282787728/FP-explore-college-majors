4041955,4,B002ZKHQT6,"The Sharpe dvds are good but nothing to touch the novels by Cornwell, the books are pure fun. Sharpe is the best of men and the worst of men a real eighteenth century killing machine. Expect the best when you gravitate to the novels.",1395964800,,233,4.318181818181818
4041956,5,B002ZKHQT6,"I liked the story line in these DVD's, they give the reader a visual picture of the way a soldier,an officer should act, and you suddenly realize that soldiering has not changed that much in the rank and file. I also learned that burning oyster shells made lime.""Get that in your eyes and you go blind."" a British Captain says. Katherine tells Sharpe their cellar is full of them..
 So Sharpe uses that to blind a French brigade,when they attack, and saved his men from death and capture. He carries out his duty, even though deadly fever has attacked his wife,Jane. We learn about Jesuit Bark ( cooked it gives quinine) that heals that kind of fever. Officers today are still expected to lead; they are still expected to show respect and appreciation of small courtesies given them by the men, and to be resourceful in carrying out their orders.
Sharpe is shown to have all those characteristics: empathy, loyalty, courage,
and leadership.
Harris expresses it in his talk with Jane when she asks why the men follow Sharpe. ""He gives his life for us, and we give ours for him.""
A great story line in all three episodes.",1376352000,,1119,4.623115577889447
4041957,5,B002ZKHQT6,"I have all of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books (and most of his others). The Sharpe DVDs keep to his high standards and are good swashbuckling stuff, well researched and acted and excellently presented. It's a great pity that both author and actor are getting past the stage where they can keep on going. However, there are many more of his books to go at even though Sean Bean may not be as nimble as he once was.",1373587200,,413,4.376623376623376
4041958,5,B002ZKHQT6,"I have nearly all of the Sharpe's series and watch them over and over. A great movie for history buffs, war movie buffs, or people who just like adventure movies.",1349654400,,162,4.433333333333334
4041959,5,B002ZKHQT6,"Sharpe's Seige and Sharpe's Revenge were excellent. Sharpe's Mission was disappointing. This is not an original Cornwell novel. Reminded me of the saying 'You can't fool Mother Nature"". It deals with Sharpe trying to find a traitor and is a lot difficult to believe, with too many plots going on at the same time. His wife Jayne is starting to show her true colors.

Overall, the set is good. I just didn't like Mission. Buy the set if you are going to complete your series, like I am.",1349654400,,485,4.511363636363637
4041960,5,B002ZKHQT6,"As usual the Sharpe's Series is topnotch.  I bought the first three at Sam's Club.  Unfortunately they stopped carrying it before I could get to number four, but that's okay, I will carry on with Amazon.  Good action, authenticity, good acting.  Not only history buffs, re-enactors, and costume epic fans will enjoy this, but also romantics and lover's of action will love it.",1289174400,5,376,4.920634920634921

8385164,4,B002ZKHQT6,"I ordered all of the Sharpe series on DVD, and we have enjoyed them immensely. However, one of the DVD's in the three pak had an earlier Sharpe episode rather than the one labeled on the disc. Sharpe's Revenge actually had Sharpe's Battle on the disc. This was in Set Four. ""Revenge"" is a key episode as it sets the tone for follow on episodes. I was disappointed that I was unable to view it, and have not found a replacement for the individual disc.",1434326400,,451,4.317647058823529
