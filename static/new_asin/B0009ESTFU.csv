8059583,4,B0009ESTFU,when I first saw this series on TV I couldn't stop laughing. it is more of a comedy then anything else ( at lest I think ). the story line is Haru Glory much gather the rave stones to defeat the shadow stones. along the way he makes new friends and meets interesting new creatures. together they all save people from the evil of the shadow guard. only episodes 1 thru 12 are in this box set.,1513123200,,391,4.090909090909091
8059584,3,B0009ESTFU,"this anime probably would have been good if we would have got the complete collection with a great or a good voice cast but since Tokyopop suck well yeah
I bet if you don't have any problem listening to it in Japanese with English subs and I'm quite sure you guys will probably like it the Creator who made this also have made Fairy Tail so that that good luck with watching",1409616000,,374,4.208333333333333

8059586,2,B0009ESTFU,"I have been a fan of Rave Master since I first viewed it years ago. When I saw this on amazon I misread the product details, thinking it was the complete anime series I promptly added it to my wish list and received it for Christmas. Unfortunately it is only the first 12 episodes. my own mistake. However, when I opened the package I noticed that the back of all the DVD cases were gouged into, which as a DVD collector is extremely upsetting to me. In addition to this, when I removed the plastic wrapping from the DVD's I found that one of the corners on disc one was busted and plastic pieces had fallen into the case. The DVDs themselves appear to be fine but the mistreatment and presentation of the cases leaves me dissatisfied as a customer.",1356825600,3,749,4.357142857142857
8059587,5,B0009ESTFU,"Rave Master is a good anime, it`s not really violant there is no blood in it and there is no swearing in it. So i would say that kids 9 and up can watch it without parents worrying. The story is interesting, i think blue is funny and i think that Haru and Elie are cute together, Most of the voice actors and actress are good, the humor is good for kids and adults, the action is good and fun, overall this is a good anime series. The only bad thing is that the show got canceled a long time ago and there are not many dvd`s of this series. You get 12 episode`s here but there are 52 in all so you might not be able to finish the story. still i think it`s worth buying.",1340064000,,669,3.8905109489051095

8059589,2,B0009ESTFU,"Let me start off this review with I bought this from movietronix for about $7.00 and now its $2.00 cheaper oh well. This item claims to first off be a box set which that it is not the main picture show is fake when sent to you. You will just receive the 3 dvds well at least through movietronix you will. The second bad thing about this was the seller decided to put gashes through the bar code on the back going through the outer wrapping through the see through plastic through the cover art and into the case a little. and this was on all 3 dvds. The third reason I really didn't like this was because my own stupidity. I thought this set would be all 51 eps but whos kidding me it is 3 dvds its about 12eps so unless syou utterly lover the first 12 eps don't get it. On top of that they only made one more vol before discontinuing and they did make a complete series box set for 1 month that you could okay buy from tokyopops own seller.

Here is something I would not call good nor bad because I didn't really care much about this but this series only came in English dub to original Japanese audio with subs but I don't really care much about that.

Now let us get to the good things. First The cover and rear art look good with on the case if mine didn't have those gashes I would love them even more. Another good thing is tokyopop actually added a episode summer guide into each case. The last thing good about this set is each dvd had its own art you don't see the unique art much but I like that.

Over all this product only gets a 2 and remember its not a box set its 3 vols sent to you in a manila envelope.",1294963200,2,1620,4.024844720496894

I loved it and I am an adult but it has it's more serious and also totally off the wall kids funny momments with characters like PLU.  PLU is a cute corn cob nosed dog as they say in the theme song but a real neat character that reminds me of ZERO from the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" on the cute scale.  I liked it.  I am buying it.  I saw it on Anime Monday on the SYFY channel, see their web site for possible viewing still for a sample maybe if it is still available.  Here is the story.....

Haru Glory is a boy who lives with his sister, Cattleya, in Garage Island. After fishing out a.... thing called Plue, he meets Shiba who entrusted him with Rave Stone or more known as Holy Bring. From there on, he embarks on a quest leaving his sister at Garage Island like his father who went to find Rave 15 years ago. He meets Elie, a girl who loves to gamble but has lost her memory. They met up with Musica at Punk Street. They have to eliminate Demon Card using Rave and is helped by Elie's uncontrollable Ethelion and Musica's ability of controlling silver as a Silver-Claimer. Unfortunately, they had to collect 4 more Raves in order to eliminate the mother of all dark brings, Sinclair. Together, they find out their past including Haru and Musica who both do not know their parents very well. They also find out the connection between Ethelion and Rave.  Also Haru must use the RAVE stones to save his land and do many face offs with his enimies.",1260144000,5,1761,4.331306990881459
8059592,5,B0009ESTFU,"You're not going to find any deep meaning in this anime, it really is for kids, but with such great and wacky characters I found myself laughing and enjoying the ""pretty good for a kid anime"" style and sometimes ridiculous villans.  Each DVD in this set has four episodes and unfortunately, only because it will be a while before the next volumes are released, leaves you wanting more.",1136937600,7,385,4.661764705882353
