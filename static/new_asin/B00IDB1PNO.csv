(How this squares with the idea that Wetona is a mixed race girl herself is never explained.)  Pappy gets the wrong idea about which man it is, and forces them into a shotgun marriage, while the real heel watches.  Wetona is hoping the guy will fess up, but things just get tenser from there.  Norma is more straightforward here than in some of her later Lady in Distress roles, and Thomas Meighan as the nice government agent who's forced to marry her is suitably stalwart.  Worth a look, and the print quality is quite decent.",1454284800,,656,4.564102564102564
