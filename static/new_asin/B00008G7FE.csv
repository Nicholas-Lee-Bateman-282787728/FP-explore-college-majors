8274129,3,B00008G7FE,"Rainforest Impressions is filled with lots of ferns and mossy tree trunks. You really get a sense of what a rainforest consists of although this is mostly just shades of green. There are not really any animals or insects to add color to the scenes. There is one moment when you will see a bunch of crimson flowers and that is nice. I think I heard some monkeys in the trees and when they scan from the forest floor to the top of the trees you get a sense of how tall the trees really are.

If you are interested in different types of plants this has plenty of strange ones. I would say this would be good for the forest deprived. It is really like a walk in a rainforest. You also get to choose from four different soundtracks. The relaxation music is my favorite and consists of soothing electronica, guitar, flute, piano and drums. You can also select a pan flute track, guitar dreams track or an echoes of nature track with animal sounds.

What I will say is that the scenes of the waterfalls are truly worth waiting for. They are very memorable. I'd love to see an entire DVD of just rainforest waterfalls. Every time they focused on water I felt very relaxed.

8274130,2,B00008G7FE,"It is like a travel log, which is simple, flat, and almost colorless in comparison to other relaxing DVDs on the market. It appears to be taken within two hours around the noontime, as the light comes straight down and never changes. You don't see colorful butterflies, exotic flowers and rare animals as expected, but trees and plants like what you may see anywhere in neighborhood woods. This may be relaxing, but definitely not entertaining, like your everyday walk. I showed the DVD to a photographer friend, who happened to like it. He said he liked its simplicity and subtlety. Regardless, it is not too bad to have a walk without going out on a rainy day for $10.",1092960000,,670,4.638655462184874
