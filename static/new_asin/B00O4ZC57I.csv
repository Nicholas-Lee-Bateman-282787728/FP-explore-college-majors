6712336,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This was a great movie.  I took 3 kids between 8 and 10, 2 girls 1 boy, and they gave it 6 thumbs up and 5 out of 5 stars.

Content and storyline were generally appropriate for children, lots of action, could be scary for very young kids though.  I would definitely let my kids watch again, and intend to purchase when it comes out.

I don't like putting spoilers in reviews, so I'll leave movie content descriptions to others.

Worth seeing!",1415491200,3,442,4.341463414634147

_________________________________________________

From Walt Disney Pictures comes an animated story of a boy named Hero, who after the death of his brother Tadashi, finishes what his brother started and seeks to uncover the truth behind his brothers death. The film is directed by Don Hall whos only been involved in one other film Winnie The Pooh back in 2011. After trailer upon trailer we finally arrive to the release of one of the most anticipated animated films of the year. It is without a doubt a good time and is made with such care that youll be amazed at what was created by Walt Disney and Co.

I cant help but express how much fun this movie was as it wasn't just your typical animated film. It brought respect to the genre and subject matter that was handled respectfully. Your so invested in the characters; especially that of Hero who is the younger brother of Tadashi. Both are highly smart and sophisticated that are able to put their minds into anything they want to accomplish. Tadashi tries to help his brother by guiding him so he can use his talents towards things that will benefit him for the future. I really enjoyed the relationship between the two brothers because even though they may see an education differently they still respect and appreciate one another.

Without a doubt the most enjoyable part of the film was that of Tadashis companion in Baymax. Its hard to explain what made me and the audience I watched the movie with come to like Baymax so much. He made you laugh so much as a programmed health robot who was slow going about. But then you gradually watch him become a close friend to Hero that you have a mutual respect for Baymax. When Heros friends get involved they are a pack of nerds who were close with Tadashi and they consist of the typical stereotypes. But they are just as entertaining as Baymax and Hero.

The villain in the film is a professor who steals one of Heros inventions and turns it into a weapon to try and avenge one of his loved ones disappearance. Your led to believe early on that it may be one person whos behind the chaos in San Fransokyo but it turns out to be somebody else. I thought the villain was cool looking and had that Transformers vibe as hes transported through the city with these magnetized pieces that are controlled by a head piece. Very cool animation sequences when Hero and his friends are being chased. You do see a human side to the villain by the end as its revealed what his intent is.

Disneys Big Hero 6 will attract audiences of all ages and will find that little kid in them to have memories after the movie is over. I highly recommend this movie as it stands close to one of the best animated films this year behind The Book Of Life. And if you pay close attention to the movie youll even see a close-up of someone who pops up in Marvel properties from time to time. A must see adventure. Go check it out!",1415404800,3,2964,4.49165120593692
6712339,5,B00O4ZC57I,Awesome movie. I watched it with my family and we all enjoyed it.,1415404800,3,65,4.076923076923077
6712340,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Before I start this review, let me mention ""Feast,"" an animated short that is paired with this main feature. It stars an English bulldog named ""Winston"" (naturally); we watch him grow from puppy to adult dog, bond with his human and share both food and love. Animation just gets better and more heartwarming all the time! I hope Amazon includes it with the DVD/Blu-ray.

Our main attraction is about a young science protg encountering an extremely talented villain who uses the boy's own invention against him! This wonderful PG-rated Disney feature film has the usual array of film stars slumming as voice actors, so I'm going to skip my usual names and their credits. Instead I want to share what I think a child will learn from this film:
  * Sometimes a very smart older brother can trick his even smarter younger brother and the results can be very, very GOOD!
  * It's not that bad to be a geek.
  * It's fun to watch a robot learn to use his brand-new body.
  * Sometimes it takes teamwork to reach a goal.
  * Everyone has a talent to offer.
  * A single-minded robot can be extremely funny.
  * It's easy to get off track and forget your goal.
  * A bad guy may have a good reason to be bad.

This is a Marvel-type comic action flick. We see the origins of various super heroes, we hear very funny character-driven banter between them, with NO insult humor; this is important to me! We see a LOT of vehicular mayhem on San Fransokyo's hilly (and narrow) streets, plus aerial mayhem when the main action starts.

Hiro is an orphan and Baymax the robot's attempts to comfort him when he suffers a loss are sweet and insistent. (Baymax is a Pillsbury Doughboy-type healthcare provider designed by his older brother.) Our hero's pain is realistic and the animation is brilliant. We screened this in 3-D but I saw no compelling rea$on for the extra expen$e.

Again we had uninformed parents see the word ""Disney"" and bring toddlers to the theater. Again we had to endure disruptive departures as the little'uns were bored to tears. ...Sigh... The rest of us really enjoyed this one!",1415404800,97,2086,4.5864864864864865

6712474,5,B00O4ZC57I,"So touching, heart warming, moving - call it anything but this movie is unexpectedly stunning.

You expect it to be cliche, a boy finds a friend in a robot and forms a superhero team to fight a masked villain- but its so much more. What you don't know is that Hiro loses someone close to him, and that the robot is a soft, plush, caretaker. The superhero team might be badass, but mostly they're caring friends who are there for each other with courage.

Its a strong story, with visually beautiful animation and great acting. Big Hero 6 follows a tradition of hit films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, just like Frozen before it and Zootopia and Moana after it.

I'll be honest. I never read nor cared about the comic book on which this was based. Most Marvel fans are the same as me on this, I suspect. So no one really cares that they made major changes to a comic book story that was just a cheap attempt to cash in on the manga craze anyway.

The result is pure awesomesauce.

I'm not crazy about the fact that they changed the setting from Japan to ""San Fransokyo,"" but other than that, this is a rousing humdinger of a movie that feels like a perfect blend of Disney and Marvel with just a dash of Pixar thrown in. The personalities of the supporting characters are a bit stock, but extremely well-done stock.

I like the mixed cultures pieces. I like the acceptance of each of the characters for the others, the understanding they expressed, and their tolerance and compassion.

As for the movie itself, I liked how the story was more about dealing with grief instead of a group of outcaste becoming a superhero. I don't see that story too often. Baymax is also very delightful. He is so cute and I love his ""Balalalala"" line. I definitely thought this movie was a million times better than Mr. Peabody and Sherman as 2014 animated films go.",1496188800,,519,4.360824742268041

6712762,4,B00O4ZC57I,"My son and I watched this in the theatre for the first time, rented it again on Amazon. I loved it because it makes the point that being minded towards science is a good thing and that being smart can make you awesome. There isn't enough of that in the world. Making a movie in which higher education is prized is something I don't think there is enough of in Hollywood, especially when it is geared towards children. This movie made me cry a couple of times, but it was worth it. And my son was interested in the science and engineering that was part of the core of the plot. From the perspective of an 11 year old boy who loves science and engineering, this was inspiring. The fact that the Robot (Baymax) was a medical provider was lovely. For once the robot wasn't in charge of destroying anything or hurting anyone. I found that to be a nice change from the way they are usually portrayed and so did my son. Maybe we should stop trying to save the princess and start showing kids that it can also be great to use their brains, instead of their muscles, swords and guns, to save the day.",1493510400,,1091,4.27536231884058

6712849,4,B00O4ZC57I,"You know how filmmakers tend to build up a lot of undeserved hype for a movie? Big Hero 6 is not that kind of movie. Big Hero 6 is worth the hype that has surrounded it. It has been so refreshing to see Disney return to its roots in creating family-friendly, humorous, childrens films again. For a while, I lost faith in the Disney company. My belief had been that in becoming the mega-billion dollar corporation they have become, they lost sight of what was important, their audiencewhat Walt himself had devoted his entire existence to achieve. But after seeing Big Hero 6 (and other recent Disney films, like Saving Mr. Banks), my faith has been restored.
Big Hero 6 is not geared toward children its geared to EVERYONE. Theres a lot to take away from Big Hero 6: the importance of family, the power that lies in true friendships, bravery, self-sacrifice and love. Without giving TOO much away, there is one particular scene, shortly after Tadashis death, where Tadashis friends (who also become Hiros friends) send him a video chat, showing genuine concern about how hes coping with the loss and that they miss him.

One of the themes of Big Hero 6 deals with grief. In times of grief, our natural response is to question our faith and our trust in God. If God is in control, why does he take the ones we love from us? Has he abandoned us?
No! He has not! To allow such thoughts to linger in our minds will poison our hearts and our spirit.
Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6 (NIV)",1487462400,,1618,4.4847457627118645

6713070,1,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a great movie BUT BEWARE of this DVD sold by World Wide Entertainment.  Maybe the seller's name should be a clue to potential problems with DVDs not compatible with players in the U.S.  We tried to play it on our Mac and it would not play because the DVD we received is for region 2 (Europe).  FYI, this is denoted on the back of the box by a small world map icon with a black 2 over the map.  The U.S. is in region 1.  Of course, you can switch the region on your Mac in order to play the movie, but I wouldn't do that if I were you.  Your Mac will allow you to switch regions only 4 times and then never again.  Probably every other DVD you own is for region 1, and who knows what other compatibility problems will pop up with switching regions.  Not sure how many of these DVDs from WWE are for regions other than region 1.  I did read one other review mentioning this issue.  Buyer beware.

6713078,5,B00O4ZC57I,"One of my favorite Pixar films... In the top-five with Toy Story 3, Ratatouille, Wall-E, and Monsters, Inc. It nudged out Bug's Life, which is still an amazing piece of film-making, and The Incredibles, still my favorite Super Hero film...

At its heart, Big Hero 6 is a story about how we cope with loss... The setting is one that is as fantastical as it is a realistic depiction of our society's exponential technology growth.  And upon that canvas of BladeRunner-meets-TheFifthElement, Pixar tells a story as timeless as MacBeth or Odysseus or Star Wars... The question of whether we allow loss to consume us or to teach us.

What makes this telling brilliant are the hilarious, intelligent and real characters this story weaves together, each bringing a perspective that enhances and delivers on the final story arc.  Like Wall-E before it, the heart of this story is an adorable robot, BayMax, whose core ""programmed humanity"" is to actually care for humanity. Despite this story starting as a gee-whiz future-utopia drama, rapidly up-shifting into an action-thriller pacing, and finally resolving as a tear-jerker mystery-drama, it's BayMax and his unwavering dedication to that core programming that holds this story together.

I also can't say enough good things about the ""random buddy"" character of Fred... While each of the other ""Scooby Gang"" characters fits their designated positions like clockwork, it's Fred's surfer-dude-libowski-dude total ownership of the ""Shaggy"" role that I really loved. His super power is quite literally being the team's cheerleader.  That he's also the Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne of the team is just a master-stroke.

Unlike, say... Cars... I'm actually looking forward to what else could be done in this universe and really do hope Pixney has some sequels in the pipeline.  The source material is ripe with good ideas.

Great for all ages, in my opinion, but the story does deal with both the loss of parents and the death of a sibling/child as primary story elements. If you our uncomfortable with your children dealing with such existential conflicts, you may want to give it time.  But the main moral of the story IS how do we grieve and it is delivered very well.",1483833600,6,2210,5.03013698630137

Despite being a big (hero) hit the theatre was very quiet that afternoon and I had the entire upper balcony to myself. My mind was soon to be blown.

In summer 2012 I had sworn off comic-book movies after being consistently underwhelmed by the repetitive formula and the fact that they ALL seem to feature a climax with a giant blue laser shooting up into the sky. Not knowing that Big Hero 6 was based on a Marvel property, I didn't immediately write it off.

I also L-O-A-T-H-E CG animated movies as EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. seems to be about talking animals doing easy slapstick. When I see these indistinguishable movies consistently making hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office I wonder what is going on in the world. Can no one else see that they are all the same? All of them!

Thankfully, Big Hero 6 avoids this awful trope, and delivers some pretty awesome 3D too. There's lots to like about Big Hero 6, but I will stick to the top 10 reasons:

1. Baymax
2. Baymax
3. Baymax
4. Baymax
5. Baymax
6. Baymax
7. Baymax
8. Baymax
9. Baymax
10. Baymax
11. Baymax

Set in an alternate, Japan-influenced California, in the city of San Fransokyo the pioneers at the institute of technology invite 14-year-old genius Hiro Hamada to join their think tank but when his older brother is killed in a terrorist attack and his own invention stolen Hiro decides it would be better to solve the crime and creates a crime-fighting team of his own with Baymax, the loveable (and inflatable) medicare robot at the very wide centre of that team.

Yes, it's an origin story, but it's a good one and I am already tired of waiting for a sequel. Big Hero 6 is literally, actually, completely impossible to not like. And where can I purchase my own Baymax?

The Blu-ray looks superb in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound and a small amount of extras.",1481414400,,2433,5.207161125319693

6713314,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Hiro is a child genius headed down the wrong path in life.  By the end, though, he completely changes course.  He shifts from using his mind to con people to inventing ingenious solutions, from being fiercely independent to being interdependent, and from trying to end a life to saving one.

How does he get there?  By allowing caring people to influence him.

This movie is heartwarming to watch and I shed tears every time I watch it.  That said, I do have 2 complaints:
--- One is the Hiro and Baymax flying scene going on too long.
--- The other is some logical errors. SPOILERS ahead.  First, theres Hiro using microbots to form buildings.  For the building to stay up, youd have to constantly be wearing that head device while constantly imagining a building.  Second, theres Callaghan surviving the fire by hiding inside a microbot dome.  How did he not suffocate inside it or escape without catching on fire or getting caught by the fire department?  And third, when Baymax sacrifices himself in the portal, he removes Tadashis chip.  The last time the chip was removed, though, Baymax turned evil, so why didn't he turn evil that time?

Despite these complaints, Im still giving this 5 stars for its heartwarming message about interdependence.",1480550400,,1252,4.821596244131455

Some parts for really little ones as there is a scene with a fire, and an older brother. After that though it is a wonderful ride through grief, and building friendship. Works exactly as described for the Blu-ray/Dvd and Disney Movie Anywhere. Get this movie, and getting Disney Movie Anywhere as on long trips, or sick days you won't have to find a Dvd that your child has smeared with fingerprints or misplaced.",1479254400,,513,4.648351648351649

6713516,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics.
Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.
Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.
Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.
The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.
Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.
The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.
The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.
A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.
If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.
Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.",1474243200,10,2881,4.479087452471483

It's just so fun and clever, with brilliant twists and an imagined future world that's very nicely based on our current world but involves changes, instead of common sci-fi ""same exact cities but gadgeted up"" or completely different world with nothing similar at all. Just a really good movie overall. And an awesome depiction of a 14-year-old boy who has some really hard stuff to work through, and despite being a genius, still having the regular emotions of a 14-year-old boy dealing with trauma.",1472774400,,670,4.686440677966102

6713709,2,B00O4ZC57I,"Oh boy...where to start...

Big Hero 6 delivers the usual Disney social-engineering pitch but wrapped in a much more attractive visual package. So attractive that the rest of the film is almost forgivable.

It's 2/3 Giant Robot Anime and 1/3 Marvel hero flick. Still, its a film about stereotypes and perceived friends and enemies. A dream of what the California Film Biz execs wish reality was. In fact...it's a reality where THEY are the monsters. And they are. Whether their motivated by greed or revenge.

Our bucktooth Asain stereotype Japanese geek (thankfully played by a Japanese) Hero-Hiro is the star of the show here, with a multicultural cast battling the sort of evil white capitalists and bitter-white-old-men that likely green-lit this project to begin with. Our enemy has the mind of Steve Jobs, the looks of Paul Ryan and the ethics of...well...Disney. Not Walt, who was more for Ayn Rand than Karl Marx, but the sort of mentality that can't conceive of how things get done in the world, without destroying and stepping on people. The fact that the entire room of Krei Tech folks are ""white"" with a riff on a General Patton to join the mix, representing our military...well...as someone who is so tired of being pandered to by the political elite...it's off putting. So is the slam on technology in general. (particularly when managed by evil white privileged males) So too is the slam on ""justice""...as Hiro is shown to learn that destroying your enemy is a very naughty things indeed. So let's find out what's bugging them instead. Like Daniel Pearl discovered. That worked out well, right?

The visuals are wildly impressive. The plot is formulaic and uninspiring. The violence is too much for little kids. The rip-offs are abundant. And the social engineering is puke-worthy.

I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat. But I am an anime fan. And this mess of a mess is truly why ""we don't win anymore"".

Ideas come from human effort. Anime came from a desire for Japan to share with the world its vision of the future and the past. Idealistic as it may have been. Today, it's sort of millennial nihilism with a not so-subtle pitch for a Marxist Utopia for those that care to pay attention. It's a world where a successful man who happens to be white, is the enemy. Where Steve Jobs or Bill Gates or even Disney himself are all demonized. But in fact, they made this film possible and the kids who are now enjoying it.

I wish I could sit through a Disney film and not feel like they were trying to brainwash me. But that's exactly what this idiocy is. I'm reminded of poor Alex sitting in the chair with his eyes pulled open. But seriously, give me old 2D lousy Osamu Tezuka any day over this crap. But hey, with the Lion King, you can have Tezuka while not dealing with the fact that the entire film is a rip off of Kimba. And we can enjoy Big Hero 6 without having to pay homage or respect to the culture and aspirational, individualist mind-set that made it possible.",1470096000,,2991,4.642722117202268

I WANT TO MAKE A PLEA TO DISNEY: Why? Why?! By making many of your popular movies unavailable to rent, consumers are forced to buy. Which for many, can mean simply spending a lot more than usual to watch a movie once or twice again. As much as I enjoyed this film, I don't want to be forced to purchase it.

Owning a digital copy does not mean you own that copy, and Disney has the right to remove any movies from anywhere at any time-- and if you look it up, they have done exactly that.

While I know you are not reading this Disney, and I know you all love money, like really, really love money---please, just let me rent your bloody movies and stream them like the normal movie loving person that I am.

Thank you,

6713938,5,B00O4ZC57I,"OMG... I love love love this movie, and I am an adult...lol.. Bought it with my daughter in mind because she is artistic and it most definitely promotes S.T.E.M technology, and it is her all time favorite so far...it even surpassed Inside Out by Pixar for her. I am not a Disney fan at all...but Big Hero 6 is truly a step away from what is the norm with Disney. You will fall in love with Baymax-he is so dang funny and Hiro and his struggle to find himself and the truth. Won't ruin it for you but trust me well worth the purchase...",1467158400,,535,4.153846153846154

It has the main character loose his brother and have to deal with his death, it shows how trusting in friends n family can help you through so much, and all through the movie you have baymax and some of the other characters teaching safety first!

The plot is emotional, funny, exciting, and everything you'd expect from a Disney Studios film.  The story is VERY loosely based on a comic story, but that isn't strong enough of a connection for someone to go read after watching this.

As for the Blu-Ray itself, the formatting basically opens up directly in the movie, and if you want to click to the previews included, you can, but they don't start automatically like normal.  Nice!",1466985600,,560,4.626262626262626

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

I would point to some of the other movies that were clearly a cash grab (where the only things animated with any effort are the primary characters and everything else is simplistic copy and pasted fluff).,1465516800,,287,4.647058823529412

I will say that this movie is absolutely NOTHING like the comic from which it draws its name and characters. They aren't even in the same realm. So much has been changed so dramatically, I'm shocked they could even make it under the same title. Nonetheless, it is a FANTASTIC movie.

This film has become one of my top 10 all time favorite Disney films. It's action packed, but it will also make you laugh and especially cry. And it deserved that best animated feature oscar in 2015. This film is right up there with Robin Hood, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Pocahontas, which are four other favorites of mine.

6714392,5,B00O4ZC57I,"If you have not yet seen this movie, I would highly recommend going to see it. It is a kids movie that is actually suitable for anyone. The story revolves around a young boy named Hiro who works through growing up, loss, grief, depressing, joy, and every other 14-year old emotion. The story does a great job of showing the real pains of loss and how to cope with them and eventually move past them. On the surface, however, it is still a fun kids movie with a lovable robot that Hiro's brother makes. I found myself laughing, pulling for the young kids, and sympathizing with Hiro all at one time. I think this is one of Disney's better new movies and am thrilled with how they pulled it off.",1462838400,,693,4.338461538461538

The 3d effects are amazing,especially at the end of the movie when the main characters cross to another dimension or level of reality. I will not stop saying the same about 3d technology:we should all support it and companies like Disney should make their 3d movies available to the public not only in movie theaters but also at home when the movies come out. I had to get my 3d copy from Europe,as well as for Maleficent. I hope that Disney change its mind and start releasing is 3d movies in America in this format again.",1462406400,,664,4.4958677685950414

This is a review if Live Die Repeat

At first I was not sure how I felt about purchasing a digital copy of a movie. But after I made my purchase and realized how much better a digital copy was than a DVD I am now purchasing all my movies as digital copies. I have tried all the other competitors and have found that Amazon is much more user friendly and works on more devised than all the others combined. And you can download off line copies to take on trips.

As far as the movies me and my sons love it. We have watched it numerious times and it is just as good every-time after the first. We can always find something we didn't see the first time. My youngest son watches this movie almost every rain day we have. I end up watching it with him and I love it great plot.",1462060800,3,953,4.8343558282208585

I hadn't watched this before, because the trailer made it seem like a boring mushy movie about a boy and a marshmallow robot in his room... how uncool could that be? But because my young kids wanted a ""nice"" boring film, I put this on.
And was instantly glued to the screen.
It grabs your attention. And is WAY too scary for kids under 6!!!
I had to stop it and finish it later because my kids were scared by the fighting bots and the man-in-the-mask flying around in the dark and trying to kill people... he reminded me more of Joker than I'd like...
The twists and turns kept surprising me... many which I didn't see coming AT ALL.
The themes were love, loss, letting go, moving on, forgiveness, and more. Such a satisfying ending.
Wow. Definitely a MUST WATCH. Wished I had seen it sooner. Don't be the same. See. It. Now. (Come on, you know you want to ;) )",1461110400,3,876,4.315151515151515

Where Frozen was all about girl power, this is a movie where the little boys can let their imaginations run wild.  Well acted with a young energetic cast, Big Hero 6 is so fun to watch.  But it's Baymax that literally steals every scene in here.

In terms of extras, the disc is loaded as only Disney would do it. Watch the movies and do your self a huge service by watching the extras.  They will not disappoint.",1460764800,,516,4.333333333333333

6714667,5,B00O4ZC57I,"The movie Big Hero 6 is very well one of the best movies of 2014. It has to deal with Hiro Hamada who was outstanding on robotic mechanics and graduated at a young age. When he wanted to get into his older brothers college, but instead misery struck and a violent fire raged causing a traumatic experience for Hiro.

Hiro became driven into depression and loneliness because of this experience. With the help of Baymax, a robot made by Hiros Brother, Tadashi, was able to help Hiro. His friends Go-Go (the tough and extreme one) Honey Lemon (the fun and optimistic one) Wasabi (the neat and well-kept one) and Fred (the weird one, help Hiro to uncover the truth behind the catastrophic fire on that fateful night. By utilizing technology Hiro was able to transform him and his friends into superheroes. They go on an outstanding adventure to uncover the truth.

I really like how this movie shows how to deal with depression while staying kid friendly. Hiro start wants to be secluded and by himself. He doesnt want to do anything anymore, but when Baymax helps him along with his friends, he begins to break out of his shell and begin to move past the fateful event. The movie also shows how if you put mind to something you can do almost anything, and it shows that even everyone needs help from their friends and families.

If you want to watch a lighthearted, family comedy movie, than you need to watch Big Hero 6. It is one of the best movies to watch. It honestly shows how to deal with real problems while staying fun and overall entertaining to watch. If you want to see good characters than this is the movie to watch.",1460505600,,1628,4.511864406779661

6714691,1,B00O4ZC57I,"A very hollow movie. A classic example of a movie that used up all the exciting moments in the trailer, and lost steam after 40 minutes. It seems once again that disney has no clue how to motivate and effectively develop characters emotionally other than killing off one, two, three, FOUR characters. On top of that, Disney peppers in some incredibly cliche, predictable one liners, adds in a thousand different ideas that go in different directions, but ultimately lead nowhere, and force an unconvincing friendship among the ""nerdy"" geniuses so they can lazily make some sort of A-team in a rushed, anticlimactic conclusion that left anybody who has some understanding of narrative direction disappointed.
I really hate to call the movie unrealistic because I understand it's a kids movie, intended for instant satisfaction and entertainment, but this a movie so plagued by inconsistencies and plot gaps that it's hard to take seriously. The ending just seemed like a load of sugar coated nonsense. Baymax just had to live despite having his memory card removed? Look at Inside Out for example: Throughout the movie, new emotions are introduced, memories are made, and in her early years everything seems simple and clear. As she gets older, things become more abstract and some things are no longer special to her. By the end, we have reached the conclusion that we should face change and accept sadness. That's a good movie. In Big Hero 6, there are no significant ideas or themes, it's just juvenile fan-service with no direction, like a guy telling you about an awesome day he had and exaggerating the whole thing, but never finishing his story. I hope somebody else takes the time to read this because I looked forward to this movie more than any other disney movie I can remember, and in retrospect, I think they could have done so much better.",1459468800,2,1852,4.901273885350318

It was seemingly overlooked by critics and was not in theaters for a long time, but is definitely a must-have movie for any Disney fan. Being that it is NOT a Pixar movie maybe detracts for some - but the non-Pixar branded Disney movies (think 'Bolt', 'Planes', and 'Wreck-it Ralph') seem to have more heart and soul than the Pixar films. 'Big Hero 6' is no exception.

6714854,4,B00O4ZC57I,I like it. Though I do feel they left too many things open in the end. But that depends on how they develope the future portions of these stories. I would like this a bit better if there would be a surprise reveal of a certain someone not being dead. His death only served the plot point of making the main character angry for specific parts of the show. I would love to see him actually marry his fiance.,1456876800,,405,4.139240506329114

6714888,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Having snagged their first Oscar for best animated feature with Frozen around two years ago, The Walt Disney Animation Studios are back in business with their new visually spectacular film, Big Hero 6.
The story follows super genius, bot-fighter, Hiro Hamada, who is investigating the mysterious death of his older brother, and the disappearance of his own microbots, which are tiny nanobots that can construct anything the controller desires.  Hiro obtains assistance from his trusty companion Baymax, a healthcare robot created by his late brother.  However, during their investigation, they discover a peculiar man in a Kabuki mask creating havoc throughout the city, but why does he possess Hiros microbots?
 The writers had struck a goldmine for this film with the animated visual effects to create the breathtaking hybrid metropolis of San Fransokyo, a combination of eastern and western cultures.  This stunning setting is the perfect mashup of the United States of America and Japan with future-retro designs, that is packed with action and adventure.  However, the biggest project done by the effects team was the microbots that Hiro designed.  In some shots there were over twenty million individual microbots produced by over forty effects animators.  This same team had also worked on the super powers of each member of the team.  For example, the character named Honey Lemon had a purse that generated special chemical balls to assist her in battle against enemies.  The inside of the purse had extraordinary gadgets that the animators had to carefully craft, plus they had to know which chemicals reacted with each other for these effects.
 Then the animators had created the two main characters who are unique and relatable.  Hiros similar to any teenager that is going through depression, but he can quickly transform into a smart aleck.  This is the first animated movie to show what its like to experience depression, and they perfected to the point.  Hiros response to his brothers death was to surround himself with anything electronic, thats exactly what people do when they're feeling down to escape reality.  Now no one could possibly forget about the instantly loveable, healthcare robot Baymax.  Hes the sweet, gentle robot that provides laughs for the audience, then with Hiros help he turns into a crime fighting machine.  Kids everywhere will be craving for a Baymax plushy after viewing this film, hopefully removing the majority of Elsa dolls from stores.
 This film had a beautiful soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman, who has been acknowledged for his work with other Disney films.  His scores are original and memorable for this movie, with the perfect blend of digital instruments and Japanese sounds to provide the futuristic feeling of San Fransokyo.  Plus, as an added bonus Fallout Boy released their catchy new single Immortals, which is sung in the middle of the film and during the credits.  When this song is playing, everyone will want to dance and sing along with the band.
 Big Hero 6 has a bit of something for the entire family, whether its the tough female characters for girls to admire, the robots for the boys, or the renowned storytelling that only Disney can accomplish will put a smile on parents faces.  I certainly enjoyed the experience of viewing this magnificent film, laughing quite often, and even I want some Baymax merchandise.  Right now Disney is on a winning streak for box office movies, and hopefully their future animated films can become the new Disney Renaissance era.  In conclusion, audiences can agree that by the end of the film theyll leave saying, They are satisfied with their care.",1456185600,,3661,5.093802345058626

6714970,5,B00O4ZC57I,"The plot has been covered in other reivews much more completely than I will cover it here.

I really enjoyed this movie as an adult. My teen children enjoyed it as well.

The characters are enjoyable and likable. I particularly liked the large medic robot. Although we are a long long way from that being reality, it was something that seemed possible. The other characters are also likable and they demonstrate traits like courage, intelligence, creativity. They do this without trying to be the 'cool kid'.

The humor that has been snuck into the movie directed towards adults is wonderful and not at all sexual in nature as you often see in other children's movies. There were several times that I laughed out loud during this movie.

Enjoy.",1454371200,,744,4.7890625

Also, a bit too sad in some respects. My kids are used to kids movies that have some sadness in the subplots, but some of these twists were unexpected and a bit too sad, in their opinion. That said, we loved Bay Max a lot and thought it was just such a unique character and story line. There is nothing else like this out, and it hits on some great emotions and lots of action too. Also, the science kids are so cool - which is so great to see in a kids' movie. Recommend this one!",1454025600,,650,4.125984251968504

Hiro Hamada is a 14 year old robotics genius who takes part in underground robot fights. He takes down one of the top fighters effortlessly with his tiny, weapon-less robot, and is chased out of the arena, rescued by his older brother Tadashi, and ends up having to deal with the police at the station after the whole operation is busted. Tadashi sees Hiros potential and urges him to go to his university, since he graduated high school early, but Hiros passion is bot fighting. After a surprise visit to the school where he meets all of Tadashis friends and sees what they're working on, Hiro quickly changes his mind and is excited to go. After getting accepted by Professor Callaghan, the head of the universitys robotics program, a fire breaks out, and Tadashi runs back inside to rescue the professor. Hiro is left behind, and just as hes about to go in after his brother, theres an explosion, knocking him out. His brother is killed in the fire, and Hiro is going through a tough point in his life, not even registering for school. But a robot Tadashi built, named Baymax, activates and leads Hiro to find out that the fire may not have been an accident. Their journey leads to a superhero adventure straight out of a comic book, complete with a super villain, an army of robots, and more.

I was blown away by this movie. From beginning to end, it had my attention and I could tell I was smiling for the majority of it. I felt like a little kid, and I don't even like superhero movies! This is one of those rare movies where I felt good watching it, and its also the first movie from Disney Ive seen since Lilo & Stitch that feels like it had a lot of heart put into it. Im not saying that Im too old for this, but Im 30 years old now, and Ive seen so many things in movies that were supposed to be sad or make you feel a certain way, but they didn't do anything for me. Here, there were scenes when I was worried for characters or the way something was animated made me feel uncomfortable because I didn't like what I was seeing. Theres one scene in particular where Baymaxs personality/care chip is removed, leaving him in attack mode, and while its a short scene, the way the camera moves during the segment, as well as the lighting, made for something that I didn't like. Thats not how Baymax is supposed to be! Change him back! And because it made me feel like this, which is more than nearly every other movie Ive seen this year, I love it. Even the post-credits scene got to me!

Look, I don't praise movies like this often. There wasn't anything in Big Hero 6 that I didn't like. The main cast of characters were all memorable. You have Honey Lemon, a super happy girl who also has a mad scientist thing going on. Theres Fred, the school mascot that wants to be a monster and is a master of spinning signs. Go Go, a tough girl who doesnt want help from anyone and has a passion for speed. And then theres Wasabi, whos the most normal of the group and as a result, acts as the voice of the audience, right down to asking what the plan is when the group is attacked and they just go after him on the spot. Hes also the only one who really understands the concept of quarantined. Unlike a few other Disney villains thatve come and gone over the last decade or so, Big Hero 6s villain is very cool and his motives, while dastardly, have substance to them. Finally, I really loved the animation and look of everything. Big Hero 6 looks a lot better than Frozen, with less empty scenes and more than just one camera angle for long periods of time. This is the first time since The Incredibles where Ive really been impressed by the way hair and clothes are animated. It lasts just a second, but theres a scene where tons of tiny robots are spilling to the ground, and it looks like they just filmed the real thing and inserted it into the movie. A lot of CG movies don't age very well, yet I think this one will do just fine, a lot like how Up and Wall-E have.

Don't hold off any longer. Watch Big Hero 6 right now.",1451520000,,4144,4.281887755102041

I found it to be excellent, both in the writing and the visual effects. The animation is steller and the plot has a emotional impact throughout the movie. Instead of the simple ""good guy - bad guy"" make-a-team and win the day, there's a lot more going on. Showing the grieving process, instead of just ""sad people in black, okay move on"", was a bit of brilliance and helps anyone who has gone through it. Friends who are not afraid to go ""You're wrong"" instead of friends who blindly support someone just because they're friends is so very refreshing.
And Baymax stays adorable throughout the entire movie and even when the movie goes silly or outrageous, it's still cute enough to accept it. How a robotic-voiced marshmellow creature can emote so well is amazing and puzzling. Excellent work.",1451088000,,903,4.614906832298137

SPOILERS:

This movie kinda starts with the main character's brother being murdered in an explosion designed to steal his invention. The main character constantly lies to people, including the aunt (with whom he lives). He sneaks out and lies about it, lies about going to school and more.

Next, there is an evil villain that tries to murder the main character and his friends, followed by a high speed chase. After this, the main character and his friends decide to fight the evil villain.

At this point (one hour into the movie), I haven't found one thing amusing. The movie is more for adults. I am not saying the movie is bad, but it isn't really what I expected at all.",1451088000,3,857,4.405063291139241

I have a Samsung 55""  Smart TV with 3D capability along with a Samsung Home Theatre Blu-ray  DVD/3D capable player both purchased in 2013. I popped in the  Blu-ray 3D disk, set my smart TV to 3D, enabled my 3D glasses and  selected English.  The disc played flawlessly with excellent picture quality and wonderful 3D effects.
So, if you're in the USA or Region 1 and are looking to purchase this movie with both  2D and 3D disc's.......it played on my system perfectly.

6715249,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6, released in 2014 from Pixar Studios, has been making great strides in the animated film industry.  Not only is it witty, hilarious and engaging, but it breaks through stereotypes and genders roles without you even knowing it! One of the main characters, Honey Lemon, is a female scientist. That right there isn't seen very often in films, due to the fact that science is mostly dominated by the males of the world. She is a kick-ass girl, who is defying everyones standards and making magic. She is your typical girl, long blonde hair, high heels, great clothes, bubbly personality, but then just a downright genius in the science world. She has her purse, which is what is then turned into her weapon when they all become superheroes. If you take a close look at it, it has a touchable periodic table of elements on the outside. So when she needs to launch one of her chemicals, she has to make it up on the fly. She doesnt have anything pre-planned, everything she comes up with is straight from her mind in the matter of a second. This is a great skill and it can show young girls that watch this movie that there is nothing stopping them from becoming a mad scientists and ruling the STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) world!
 The amount of emphasis that they actually put on technology in this movie is great. Especially since the movie is geared towards children. It is amazing that it can show how cool science is and that it is something pretty amazing to be able to study in school. All these characters, both females and males, black, latino, mixed race and white are all able to succeed in science, which is typically stereotyped as a white male field. They break all these assumptions down and it opens up so many more doors for the viewing audience. As a female in the STEM field, its empowering. The writers also show that the nerds that youll find in Big Hero 6 aren't your usual nerds. No funny glasses, weird clothes, ect. They are the coolest kids around the college with someone of the most impressive inventions. It paints a new image for the people in the science field and shows the world that its actually a pretty amazing field to join.
 Along with breaking down stereotypes, Big Hero 6 is just a great movie, for all ages, filled with laughter. From pop culture references and jokes, to long awkward moments of silence that just make you crack up. The best part of laughter is Baymax, who can be described as a 6-foot-tall plus sized marshmallow with the heart of a child. He doesnt understand common jokes and sarcasm, so most things just go over his head. Baymaxs spatial reasoning is off too, so he tends to run into everything, chairs, bookshelves, doors, people and so on. It just adds a small bit of humor to nearly every scene.
 For the children and their parents who are out there enjoying this movie, it really seems that they would be able to connect with it on many different platforms. There is sadness that emerges throughout the movie, not to overpower all the good times. When Tadashi passes away, Hiro falls into a depression. In the same way any young child would. It is complex yet so simple to be able to show children how depression is handled for someone their age, whether they can connect to it or not. Eventually Baymax is destroyed trying to safe Hiros life, which essentially, is his sole purpose as a robot. Parting with Baymax causes Hiro to try and build a new one, a new version, so the memory of his brother is able to live on through this robot.
 Big Hero 6 is an all-around bad ass movie that is plowing through stereotypes and your typical story plots of childrens movies these days. It has action, humor, sadness, all under a futuristic feel. Almost any will enjoying watching this movie due to the fact that it is a feel-good animated movie that everyone can connect to. Definitely a great movie that the whole family could enjoy seeing.",1447718400,,3918,4.5675675675675675

6715295,5,B00O4ZC57I,I brought this item as new because I purchase other items such as this used and it is not a good idea to do so since countless times I was ripped off from the digital copy and the digital code was claimed.  However getting something like this new is a great idea.  I brought this combo set because my little brother loves disney movies and has a big collection of them however getting digital copies is a better idea since he either losses the dvd and never is found again or they just get damaged over time when not properly put away.  This movie is not completely a violet movie and I think that this would be a great purchase for little kids and a great watch for older adults.  I would recommend getting this movie and getting digital copies instead of the getting dvds and losing them or have them get damaged over time of misuse.

6715305,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a movie about a young teenage boy trying to figure out where he belongs in life.  The movie opens with a sign that reads San Fransokyo.  Opening with that sign gives us a hint as to what the movies setting will be like.  Its a mix of San Francisco, California and Tokyo, Japan.  The mix of Japan with California instates that there will be Japanese aspects throughout the movie, such as the way the superhero costumes will look.  It could also be telling us a bit of Hiro and Tadashis family lineage.  They could possibly be part Japanese.
 An intense fight scene between two battle bots follows the initial opening.  There are two bots; one is fairly large and one is about medium sized.  The sizes of the bots are directly related to the people controlling them.  The person controlling the larger bot is a fairly large man, and the person controlling the medium sized bot is about a medium sized girl.
 Shortly after the opening bot fight, our main character, Hiro, is introduced.  Hiro is a small, dark haired boy with almost no hopes or dreams other than becoming the best bot fighter around.  When Hiro brings out his bot and asks to battle with the large man, they all laugh at him and think its a joke.  The people in the arena tell him to go home because he is just a kid.  They should have known something was different about this kid when he pulls out a huge wad of money to prove hes a worthy opponent.
 The people in the arena accept Hiros bet, then sit back to watch the fight go down.  Hiro placed his tiny bot in the arena with the larger bot and began to fight.  He fails the first time, and pulls out another huge wad of cash.  At this point, everyone should have realized Hiro was either a stripper, or he was insanely good at bot fighting.  No fourteen-year-old boy has that much cash.  Even if he did aquire it from mowing lawns, why would he be carrying that around with him if he wasn't expecting this to happen?
 As you have probably already figured out, Hiros bot made a come back in the second round, and destroyed the large bot.  This shows that you can overcome any obstacle, even if that obstacle is four times your size.  Immediately after the bot fight, Hiros brother, Tadashi, drives Hiro away on his motorcycle.  The entire time they are driving, Tadashi is yelling at Hiro telling him how he shouldnt be bot fighting because it is illegal and Hiro is too smart to need bot fighting in his life.  The kid graduated high school when he was only thirteen!  Hiro states that there is, no stopping him, however, ironically, the cops stop him right after he says that.
 When Hiro and Tadashi are being picked up from jail, Aunt Cass is introduced.  Shes severely upset because Hiro was bot fighting again.  From this whole incident, we can conclude that Tadashi and Aunt Cass both care very deeply about Hiro.  They were only upset with him because they love him and they were worried about him.
 After the bot-fighting incident, Tadashi and Aunt Cass began to give Hiro a push to go to college.  When they mention college to Hiro, he replies by stating that he already knows everything he will learn in college; however, when Tadashi opens the doors to the nerd school Hiro becomes fascinated with everything going on around him.  This is the first time we see Hiro taking an interest in furthering his education.  Hiros brother may have a large role in him wanting to go to college, because we can see how Hiro looks up to Tadashi.  Not to mention, Tadashi has a pretty interesting lab at school.
 At this point in the movie, we have already learned how much Tadashi cares about Hiro, so we are extremely shocked when he rips some of Hiros arm hair off with a strip of duct tape.  Obviously, Tadashi has to know something is going to help Hiro; thats where Baymax comes in.  Baymax responds to the sounds of pain and distress, such as ouch.  Baymax rises up out of his red box and introduces himself as a personal healthcare companion; this infers that Hiro may need a healthcare companion later in the movie; he may encounter danger in his future.
 After visiting the nerd school, Hiro finally takes an interest in college.  He began to work on a project to gain admittance.  Hiro is convinced he will never get into the school, but just as he is about to give up, Tadashi picks Hiro up and spins him around saying, Think outside of the box.  Shake things up and use that big brain of yours to think your way out.  This can be directly related to how Tadashi had to think outside of the box in order to build Baymax.  An example of imagery for this is when Baymax comes out of his red box.  Baymax isn't able to do anything inside of the box, however, once he comes out, he can accomplish almost anything he desires.
 Hiro finally thinks of what he can do to get into this school, and begins building microbots that are controlled by a neurotransmitter.  When he arrives for his presentation, Hiro begins to show nerves for the first time.  The nerves show that he actually cares about doing well and getting into this school.  This could possibly be the first time Hiro has experienced feeling that he isn't good enough.  Hes used to being able to coast through, and the thought of actually being able to fail is scary to him.
 Hiros microbots worked perfectly, and everyone was amazed!  Callaghan accepted him into the school, and he even got an offer from Krei Tech.  Krei tells Hiro that his technology could be revolutionary, but Callaghan says Hiro cant trust Krei.  He says Krei is guided by his own self-interest and he cuts corners.  For that reason, Hiro decides to attend the school with Callaghan.  Personally, I saw this as a mistake in the beginning of the movie, because Callaghan showed hostile tendencies towards Krei.  This meant Callaghan must have some sort of motif to get revenge on Krei by keeping Hiro at his school.  It could also show that the words Callaghan used to describe Krei were really words he could have used to describe himself.
 After making his decision, Hiro and his brother go for a walk.  Hiro expresses that he would not have made it this far without Tadashi, then the building catches on fire.  Tadashi ran into the burning building after expressing that someone has to go in to help Callaghan who is still trapped inside.  The building exploded just as Tadashi ran in, and Tadashi and Callaghan both died, or so we thought.
 At Tadashi and Callaghans vigil, everyone is wearing black except for Fred.  Fred is wearing white, because he is the bright spot throughout the entire movie.  Hes consistently the comic relief.
 After the vigil, Aunt Cass goes up to check on Hiro.  There is a full plate of last nights dinner sitting on his windowsill.  This might show that Hiro has begun not to eat, because he is so depressed about Tadashi dying.
 The next day, Hiro finds a microbot in his jacket pocket.  Baymax is convinced that the tiny robot is trying to go somewhere, but Hiro says its impossible since it is attracted to the other microbots, and the rest were destroyed in the fire.
 Baymax and Hiro began walking through the city to wherever the tiny robot was taking them, and discovered a warehouse full of microbots.  The microbots rise, which means someone new is controlling them.  This indicates that Hiros bots were stolen.
 Hiro transforms Tadashis friends into superheroes, and reformats Baymax into a killing machine in order to capture the man in the mask who set the fire, killed Tadashi, and stole the microbots.  After a couple of battles with the villain in the mask, they finally catch him, and all is mostly good in the end.
 Overall, I believe Big Hero 6 is a wonderful movie.  I don't want to spoil the ending, because I believe everyone should see it for themselves.  Its an amazing story of how to go through hardships, learning how important friends and family are, and always doing the greater good.  Hiro shows children and young adults that even though you are young, you can accomplish great things.",1446681600,,8019,4.536262203626221

6715319,5,B00O4ZC57I,"The animated Disney movie Big Hero 6 has several main themes, such as dealing with grief after losing a loved one, the importance of friendship, and the importance of seeking justice, not revenge. The lovable characters and the humor in this movie also makes Big Hero 6 a great movie to see with your family.

Big Hero 6 is set in a fictional metropolis called San Fransokyo. The main character is Hiro, a fourteen-year-old boy who has a talent for robotics and graduated high school at the age of thirteen. Both of Hiros parents are deceased and he lives with his older brother Tadashi and his Aunt Cass. In the beginning of the movie, Hiro is participating in a robot fight and betting on it, which is illegal. He hustles the man hes bot fighting against and takes his money after winning. The man and his group of friends are about to beat Hiro up when Hiros brother Tadashi shows up and saves him. Hiro is still caught by the police though and thrown in jail. Tadashi, believing that his brother should use his talents for something with a greater purpose, takes his brother to his Technology University. Hiro is amazed by the technology at his brothers school and decides that he has to go there, too. He then goes on to create a unique and revolutionary invention that impresses Professor Callaghan who allows Hiro into the University. Shortly after, a fire starts at the convention and Tadashi runs back into the building to save Professor Callaghan. The building explodes just as Tadashi makes it in and Hiro is shown being blown back by the explosion.

After the explosion the screen goes white and everything seems to slow down. There is no music for a while and just silence. The next scene briefly shows pictures of Professor Callaghan and Tadashi with lit candles surrounding them. It then shows a group of people dressed in black holding black umbrellas in the rain and fog. The music in this scene sounds gloomy and depressing especially with the sounds of thunder and rain in the background. The same music carries on to the next scene where Tadashis friends are shown looking very solemn at the wake. The camera then slowly moves over to the right to show Hiro sitting at the top of the stairs with a dark shadow cast over him. The wall near Hiro shows the shadow of raindrops from a nearby window. All of these effects emphasize the grief Hiro is feeling after losing his brother.

A few weeks later it shows Hiro in his bedroom and there are hints that he is still depressed. His Aunt Cass is shown coming in with a plate of food, which she exchanges for another plate of food on his desk that seems to never have been touched. While shes in his room she opens up his blinds to let some light in. Right after Aunt Cass leaves though Hiro closes the blinds, making his room dark once again. Hiro then discovers Baymax, a healthcare companion robot created by Tadashi, by accident after he drops his robot on his foot. The sound of Hiros pain activates and inflates Baymax. Baymax who looks like a giant huggable marshmallow eventually helps Hiro heal emotionally from losing his brother.

Baymax does this by helping Hiro find justice for his brothers death. Hiro, having a light-bulb moment, realizes that his invention was never destroyed in the fire and that someone started the fire so they could steal his invention. Hiro ends up turning Baymax into a superhero by downloading ninja moves onto his data chip and by creating him a costume, so he can help him catch the villian. Tadashis friends also join in to help Hiro and use their inventions as part of their hero costumes.

Hiros, Tadashis friends, and Baymaxs costumes are all very colorful which could symbolize Hiros healing. Everyone has different colors in their outfit except for Hiro and Baymax. They both are wearing the colors purple and red. This could be because Baymax was the one to help start Hiros healing process and Hiro is the closet to Baymax. Things are getting brighter for Hiro now that he has friends to help and support him. For example, when Hiro finds out who killed his brother he immediately tells Baymax to destroy him. His friends however encourage him to do the right thing and to not turn to revenge. They save him from doing something he would most likely regret later.

At the end of the movie, Hiro ends up risking his life to save the villains daughter, Abigail, who was trapped in a portal. Hiro and Baymax do end up saving Abigial, but at a cost. Baymax has to end up sacrificing himself to save both of them. The man who was responsible for Tadashis death ends up getting caught and going to jail. We find out the main motive of the villain was revenge. Hiro is the one to stop this revenge cycle by not letting his anger get the best of him. We see Hiro encompass some of Tadashis traits by the end of the movie, such as bravery and selflessness.

Overall this was a delightful movie that all ages should enjoy. The exciting storyline and the emotional pull will keep you interested throughout the whole movie. The movie also teaches us that friends are important when you're grieving and that revenge is never the right answer. So if you're looking for a great family movie thats funny and has a great overall message, youve found it.",1446508800,,5252,4.59871931696905

So therefore, I ordered Big Hero Six on Direct-TV. He watched the movie twenty times. In addition,  to this my grandson sat very quietly in the movie at age two  while watching Big Hero Six.

The point I am making is that I did not have a DVD player, Recently, I purchased a DVD player. Having said that, my grandson is now three years old and he continues to watch Big Hero Six. In fact he wants to be Baymax for Halloween. My daughter ordered his costume from amazon and he is really  excited......

""Big Hero 6"" is yet another Disney Disappointment (though not so awful as ""Guardians""). (Bear in mind that I'm 68, and have been watching Disney films for over 60 years.) It's a mechanical run-through of most of the tropes of such storytelling -- alienated young man suffers from terrible loss... Must I go through the rest of them?

The characters are unappealing, because they aren't interesting. Nor is there any interesting interaction among the principals -- each is defined by one main characteristic, and little else. Why should we care about any of them -- especially Hiro? Can you say ""affectless""? Sure you can. (If you care to.)

The only interesting ""personality"" is Baymax. The writers and animators explore just about every joke one can make about a balloon robot, and most are funny. Of course, in ""real life"", Hiro would develop a strong emotional -- even pathological -- attachment to the machine (created by his dead brother). The writers' failure to explore this in depth is a serious -- and arguably fatal -- error. But what do young'uns know about telling good stories?

The animation is astounding. The humans move //exactly// like living people. Once Disney figures out how to cloak them in plausible skin, we will have reached the era of the true ""synthesbian"". (In ""Childhood's End"", Arthur C Clarke predicted this would occur around 2000. He wasn't far off.)

""Big Hero 6"" could have been a deeper and more-moving story. It's merely an entertaining time-waster.

PS: Several reviewers have made unfavorable comparisons with ""The Iron Giant"". Disney did its own -- and much better -- version of the latter: ""Lilo and Stitch"".",1445472000,,1749,5.0137931034482754

Kids love this movie because it's action packed. The art is clever and compelling. But this story is not personal to the one who wrote it. It's basically the same plot as The Lion King. Put that aside, if you have never watched a Disney movie, it would be an interesting story.

6715454,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Whenever a film can extract pathos from a child, get them to think about the ways that the characters in it are handling the situations on screen, its more than passing entertainment or a screen-based babysitter. Big Hero 6 does this very well by providing an interesting setting, relatable and humorous characters with plenty of humanity (good and bad), and by using its cool factor to make an old cautionary tale into something relevant to a newer generation.

The idea that revenge can fulfill has some kind of innate calling, and whether we are fulfilled if we answer the call is a question at the center of the movie. Hardly new territory, even for a Disney film, but the exploration was beautifully done, with concepts that children can pick up.

Pacing kept children and adults in my house glued to the screen and the script was well-handled. The actors were well chosen with personalities diverse enough that I think your child will come to have a favorite, and it may not be the same as mine. The soundtrack was good, if not especially memorable (excepting the licensed portion, which had some catchy tunes). Most importantly, it was very entertaining, with moments of humor, contemplation, grief, and action.

As for the package itself  The Blu-Ray (Blur-ay?) disc has great picture and sound without any artifacting. The included DVD is nice to have on long car trips and the digital copy is Disney Movies Anywhere, which can be activated and downloaded (in some cases) though iTunes, Google Play, Xbox Video, and others.

It was inspiring to my kids to see the protagonists use their intellect to create or utilize technologies to solve problems and by becoming essentially Saturday morning cartoon superheroes to boot. Without becoming preachy, a message was conveyed and understood that its creating, not destroying, that honors the memory of those whom weve lost.

Excellent film with a great package.",1443657600,,1916,4.971875

The best part of this movie is the incredible visuals, Disney has never skimped on artistry.......scripts are another matter entirely.  In this case, the glue holding the overly familiar premise together is Baymax, a nice cuddly robot.  He is unique, fashionable, and funny.  Pity they didn't give him his own movie.  Here, he plays second to a pouty adolescent (Hiro Hamada) too bright to contain.  Just because you can create something, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should.  In this case, Hiro creates micro-bots and in doing so creates a potent weapon in the wrong hands.  Naturally, the wrong person gets a hold of them and wields them as a weapon of great destruction.  As Sci-fi adventure stories go, it's not bad.  The action is zippy, the characters fun, and then there's Baymax..........so what if some people die along the way.",1441670400,,958,4.93125

6715554,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This is a really cute, feel-good movie. I'm an adult and liked it so much that I bought it on Amazon instant video just so I can watch it whenever I need a laugh.

It takes place in an imaginary town that resembles half San Francisco and half Tokyo. Two brothers are being raised by their aunt. Both brothers are 'techy' type guys. The older brother creates 'Baymax,' an inflatable male nurse in his lab at college. Baymax is cute and non-threatening in the looks department. There are a lot of one-liners from Baymax that had me laughing so hard that I had to stop & go back a bit just to hear the rest of the dialogue.

The younger brother, Hero, is smart beyond his years and also an inventor; we first meet him at a 'bot fight' where he hustles the unchecked champion with his 'bot' that he's made himself. Hero is a mischievous kid. Later we meet other students from the older brother's college, who also become Hero's friends. The group, all together, makes six - which alleviated my confusion about the movie's title (I had not remembered there being a Big Hero 1, 2. etc).

It is typical Disney - orphans, some big problem, and it all working out in the end. Baymax's remarks and reactions just kill me though, he's hilarious.",1441584000,,1234,4.451327433628318

It is also a little sad, as is every Disney movie.  If you are a Disney fan, don't hesitate to buy this movie, you will laugh and you might even cry a little.  I did both.  The more I watch it, the more I pick up as well.",1440979200,,394,3.4827586206896552

This way there is no need to put the disc into a player we just access the digital copy. My 2 year old daughter and 3 year old son love Big Hero 6.

6715610,3,B00O4ZC57I,"It's good, and it looks great, but it's not top of the line. The characters needed more dimension and depth, so we'd have more connection with them. It's curious that the movie leaves some critical story items totally unexplained, unlerss you happen to have read the comic book. Like how did San Francisco and Tokyo merge? Why is the robot named Baymax? Why the whole we're-sort-of-doing-anime-but-in-a-bland-Disney-way approach? Clearer story and characters would give it more drive and punch. It lags in the second half as the story devolves into a very generic superhero saga. It's okay, but not nearly as good as, say, the Toy Story franchise or The Incredibles.",1440892800,,666,5.0636363636363635

in a nutshell, there is a teenage robotic prodigy who gets in a bit of trouble.  Big brother comes to help him out and encourage him to go to school and then the tone of the movies (at least in relation the trailer) changed for me.  We get much more action in this movie than I expected and we have good guy, bad guy, misunderstood guy and scientific mistakes.

Also, I figured it was probably good based on the fact that the price didn't go down like other movies released at the same time.  But the final and best reason was when I was in line at Target with it on the counter with my other purchases, the lady behind me said ""Did you see that movie?"".  I said no but I thought it looked good.  She said it was the best and mentioned other movies I had seen and she said if I liked them I would love this movie.  And, I did.  It was a fun movie with some real but sad moments and happy funny moments as well.

6715719,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Im writing literally minutes after I finished the movie. Its kinda one of those things that you wanna get on paper right off the bat.

First off, of course I loved the movie overall. Everything good thats been said about it I wish I could fit in here. The animation. The setting. The storyline. The amazing way in which Baymax transcends the man-machine barrier and makes me emotionally vested into him in a way that, frankly, many human actors cannot  all of that adds up to a riveting animated movie.

And I get thats what it is, an animated movie. A movie to show a pretty story with pretty pictures and pretty sounds to make the audience ooh and aah. Big Hero 6 doesnt pretend to be anything that its not.

But.

(and get ready because Im about to pick enough nits to fill up a warehouse) (and also SPOILERS)

something felt barely perceptible out of place as the credits started rolling. The backstory of the characters seemed rushed, almost. The progression of the story was jerky and inconsistent at times - plot points were mechanically put in place and left there, purely functional without much depth; the characters actions seemed arbitrary and very okay now we go here because the plot line needs us to-ish. Ive had low Cs in most of my lit classes so I cant really describe it properlyits kinda like wolfing down a sandwich because you're late for a meeting. You get the sustenance but you don't really experience the individual flavors.

And throughout the whole film I kept thinking the same darn thing over and over: power source power source power source. Why does a charge of Baymaxs battery last for both a few hours of walking and THEN the rest of the movies hero shenanigans? Where the heck are the microbots getting their energy? Is SanTokyo covered by some sort of wireless-charging magic? If so, why isn't Baymax using it? This isn't Arry Pottah; this is a sci-fi film. With things supposedly grounded in laws of physics.

Once the Iron Man suit and the lightsaber arms popped up you can tell the sci-fi wasn't meant to come under any level of scrunity. (See: Meet The Robinsons.) But the preview and beginning makes you think that there will be exciting and innovative and real tech in hereand, for nerdy me, it was kind of a letdown. Worse, well have plenty of young scientists who will go off and conceive new technologies without a thought to practical limitations, only to be disappointed when their microbot needs to lug around a 9-volt battery to operate. Reality suxx. But hey I'm only getting started.

Thank goodness Baymax was an actual, materially-possible robot. Props to the laser keyboard (which you can actually buy on Amazon) and the 3D printer. Magnetic servos/actuators are technologically feasible (when hooked up tO A POWER SOURCE DAMMIT) and Im glad that at least some things were grounded in reality.

Are you telling me that a giant stereotypical villain walked around SanTokyo on a giant wave of microbots AND NOBODY NOTCIED? Where did the microbots get construction materials for the platform at the showcase? How does the showroom spontaneously burst into flames? Why the f**k does Hiros brother rush into a clearly blazing building? Explosion source? Explainable only if Callingam knew about the project and set up the fireworks a long time ago. And later, when Callingham reveals the microbots protected himlookee here, those microbots won't protect you from combustion-level temperatures or lack of oxygen. Or maybe they do, these are evidently magical microbots, after all.

The final scenes? If a microbot can feel the tug of others from across the city, why do they disassemble so easily and get sucked into the stargate? And yes, it is a stargate, arguing otherwise is pointless. If Callinghan worked with Keil on the Stargate project, he must have known that objects were entering/exiting another dimension. Where was Callinghan during the demonstration? He couldve seen the error and stopped the demonstration. Why did they go straight from a hat to a human being? Why his daughter? Did it never occur to him to rebuild one portal and, I don't know, stick a camera on a selfie stick and see what was on the other side? Did it not occur to Hiro that he had no clue what he was getting into? If Abigail was alive twenty years after the fact, they could let it explode, calm everyone the f*ck down, rebuild the stagrate properly in a controlled environment and go fetch her. (Or maybe they couldnt. Maybe they know that this opportunity might not come again. And Hiro knows what its like to lose someone you love. So that all kinda holds up, fine.)

And once were inside the thing I cant really say anything, since this is past the realm of logic  but why were there huge pieces of building floating around? The stargate is 20-25 feet across, at most. Anything bigger than that would simply not fit through. Hypersleep? Come ON. The trippy clouds were really cool but, aargh, hypersleep? When Abigail piloted her little rocket thingy into the portal  and realized that there was no second one to exit out of  why didn't she just try to fly out the entrance? If she fell into hypersleep the moment she entered the alternate dimension or whatever, why didn't Hiro fall asleep as well?

The ending is just as tearful and some-people-are-worth-melting-for-y as we all expected and secretly wanted it to be. But if the debris hit Baymax on the FRONT, then why did his BACK leg thrusters stop working? Why did Hiro build only one thruster arm for Baymax? Would it have been that difficult to detach baymax from the rocket arm, put him on the ship with Abigail, and THEN fire it off? The robot is flexible. He coulda bent around or something.

But all that is hard to think of when you're in an alternate dimension and your only escape is a Stargate that could close at any moment. So, again, it all holds together. I rest my case.

And at the very end, Im glad Hiro caught up with what probably half the audience had come around to: Baymax is a robot and, no matter how advanced a natural interaction algorithm he possessed, could be rebuilt. The green Tachi card in the rocket arms fist was super cute and a great way to end the movie. But if Baymax took the card out before placing the thruster arm on the ship (hed have to, or Hiro wouldve noticed him taking it out) then the only card left in him wouldve been the red destroy one. How did that cards programming still allow him to keep his healthcare protocol and do the whole satisfied with my care/blockbuster worthy teary ending thing? Tachi mustve kept some low-level instructions in the robots non-removable memory.

If you're not ready to kill me at this point, good job. And remember, I still think that, all things considered, it was a great movie.

6715727,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Big Hero 6""

1. This is the most pleasant surprise I've seen at the movies in 2014. From the cutesy trailer and the stupid title, it's like Disney doesn't want anybody to know what the movie really is.

2. It's about a 14-year-old genius named Hiro Hamada who lives in the city of San Fransokyo. He's out of high school, bored, and thinks college is for nerds. He spends his time in the city's battle robot underground. Hiro's older brother, Tadashi, is a robotics engineering student who has invented a new kind of robot named Baymax that specializes in health care.

3. After some bad things happen, Hiro reluctantly teams up with Baymax and Tadashi's friends to stop someone from stealing Hiro's own invention of swarming microbots. But that quest opens up bigger problems.

4. There are themes of death and loneliness in the film that aren't obvious from the way the movie is marketed. I was more emotionally invested in the movie than I expected to be.

Also, I really liked how it dealt with the misconceptions people have about other people with everyone thinking Fred lived under a bridge when instead it was this huge mansion.

6715794,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Great book and lots of funny and sad parts. I the no the most was when Hiro losses his pal Baymax. That is really sad. But there are some highlights to this story. Let me introduce them to you...

1. Hero has graduated from high school and thinks collage is not for him.
2. Tadashi has just got Hiro from doing a bot fight. Then (surprise!) The police are blocking the exit ( bot fighting was illegal).
3. Hero comes home from th police with aunt Cuss. She is mad (duh). Then Hiro tells Tadashi he has learned his lesson. But then Tadashi sees him looking up another bot fight.
4. Tadashi takes him to the bot fight but he needs to go into his school first. So the two brothers go on in. Then Hiro sees all this cool stuff. Then he comes comes into his brothers room. Turns out Tadashi was what working on a robotic nurse (Baymax).
5. Tadashi shows Hiro Baymax by hurting him with duct tape. Not the best way to show  something.
6. They head home  and Hiro wants to go to this place that Tadashi goes to. So then Tadashi explains that they have a  contest thing and in order to win you had to blow their boss away. Then Hiro thinks of something... Something that will cause trouble later on. Find out more by watching this haralious/sad movie!

6715798,3,B00O4ZC57I,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

Let me begin by asking, why must Disney movies always kill the parents? I simply don't understand this. Just because Walt Disney lost his parents doesn't mean his legacy should involve forcing generations of children to share his same grief! In this movie, it's more of this senselessness: the main star's parents are dead. Shortly in the movie, his brother is killed in a very intense manner, leaving no question he is gone. Seriously? None of this was necessary. The story could have been played out otherwise.

Other than this complaint, the movie overall wasn't very good. The story is thin, the character development is non-existent as the most interesting character is Baymax, but at least the nemesis was dark and intimidating! It's a visual masterpiece but otherwise a flop. The action scenes were top notch. It reminded me of Spider-Man 2 but an animated movie with a Dr. Octopus like villain. Very intense for an animated movie. I suppose that's way there was such a great reception to this movie in general. It has the darkest and most intimidating villian of any animated movie I've ever seen.

Nonetheless, it didn't need the death of so many characters as I mentioned. There was a moment half way through the movie where Baymax is reprogrammed into a killing machine. Terrifying. That wasn't necessary either. At the end of the day, there was several notable things this movie got right. But it couldn't overcome all the things it did wrong. I wouldn't recommend to small children. 3 out of 5, a largely forgettable movie.",1438646400,2,1553,4.875

6715882,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Science teachers everywhere are probably celebrating Disneys newest movie, which turns a young boys precocious engineering skills into a superhero adventure thats every bit as fun as it is inspiring.
In a near-future mash-up city of San Fransokyo (a marvel of animation design), young Hiro and his brother live with their loving but whacky Aunt Cass (voice of Maya Rudolph) above a caf. Hiro, smart and rebellious, prowls the city in search of illegal robot wars, which he always wins with his small but deceptively powerful little electromagnetic bot of fury. His brother Tadashi is a star student at the university science lab; used to rescuing Hiro from his nightly misadventures, he sees the talent in his little brother and tricks him into visiting the lab, where Hiro is hooked on the equipment, technology, and Tadashis band of way-cool nerdy friends and their imposing instructor, Professor Callaghan (voice of James Cromwell). In order to be accepted to the program, Hiro debuts an amazing new invention at the science fair, which gains the attention of superindustrialist Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk from Firefly). But when Tadashi and Callaghan are killed in a mysterious explosion, Hiro loses all hope, until Tadashis nurse bot Baymax inspires him to find the truth. Hiro upgrades Baymax into a skilled combat bot and recruits his brothers friends to turn themselves and their projects into a superhero team. As a character, Baymax is not quite as endearing a robot as Wall-E, but his soft robot design and demeanor and the lessons he offers are terrific for the younger set. The animation, characterizations, and story are all top-notch and young viewers may well be inspired to take a greater interest in science. Theres plenty here to enjoy for all ages.

Big Hero 6 is based on the Marvel comic series, though with significant character and story changes. This is Disneys first animated Marvel film.

Its interesting that, since acquiring Pixararguably the highest level of animated moviemakingDisney has upped the animation game under its own name to produce a string of some of its best films in years (along with Bolt, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen). With Pixars recent slippage in originality and quality (Cars 2, Brave), will the Disney brand regain the mantle?

Maybe it's that after watching it several times, I still didn't know what the character's names were.  The only character I actually liked or felt ""connected"" to was Baymax.

It looked like scenes were built on finding what would be best for comedy, foresaking any story line that made sense.  When film companies have a clear loser, they should refrain from overhyping to get their return on investment.  It reduces future credibility.  Otherwise it was generally good clean humor with a sense of morality, which is hard to find in movies these days.",1436400000,,440,5.069444444444445

I hadn't.

From what I saw from the trailers, I was expecting a cute and funny movie with humor and robot action targeted at 9 year old boys.  Again, I was wrong.  Very wrong.  This movie will be enjoyed by anyone - boy or girl, young or old.

There are a lot of amazing things done right in this movie:
-The background music sets the tone perfectly, making your heart race during the action scenes and your heartstrings tug at the delicate moments.
-Normally I don't really care for CGI, but it's really come a long way in the past few years, and some if the scenes in this movie look real.  It's impressive.
-The story is outstanding.  15 minutes in, it took a whole different route than I was expecting.  Up until the very end, I didn't know what was going to happen next.
-The unique mix of characters that you can't help but love.

I could go on and on about how awesome this movie is.  It truly is a masterpiece.  Between the futuristic and original setting to the spot-on acting - it's all well done.  But the thing that makes this movie so good is that most everyone can relate to it somehow.  Who would I recommend this movie to?  Everybody.  It's one of Disney's best.",1435449600,,1308,4.295081967213115

Very nice movie night on the couch during a slow weekend with a rain storm.

6716189,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Confession time  this DisNerd missed going to see Big Hero 6 in the theaters.  I know, I know, Im considering having to turn in my certification.  I just don't seem to be making it out to the theaters much these days.  But based on the high recommendations the movie was getting, I did buy it and watched it this weekend.

For those who have missed it, the movie is based on Marvel characters and tells the story of Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter).  Hes a boy genius who is wasting his talents and time on illegal robot battles.  However, after a tragedy, he finds himself connecting with Baymax (Scott Adsit), the medical robot that his brother created.  Together the two get caught up in an adventure when they realize that something Hiro had created has fallen into the wrong hands.  Can they defeat this villain?

If I knew this animated movie was based on Marvel characters, Id forgotten about it.  In fact, when I sat down to watch it, I think I knew less than what I just put in that teaser, so I didn't go into the film with any expectations at all.

So when I say I found the first third a little slow, it means I really did find it slow.  It wasn't that I was waiting for the story to get to the point I didn't know what was going to happen next, it was that it seemed to be moving slowly.  Now, I do realize they had to establish the characters and set up the plot, and stuff from that first third came into play later on, but it still felt slow to me.

However, once the story got going, I really did get into it.  The action was great and the mystery was well done.  I thought I had things predicted early on, but I didnt.  A couple twists caught me by surprise and I like that.

I will say the film is darker than I was expecting.  I probably would have known it was coming if I had realized it was Marvel.  Its within normal superhero story realm, but a bit darker than I was expecting from a Disney animated movie.  It is rated PG, and that rating should be taken seriously, but most kids will probably be fine with it.

On the flip side, one attempt at comic relief is a character named Fred voiced by T. J. Miller.  Unlike the geeky rest of the main cast, hes supposed to be a slacker.  However, many of his lines and antics annoyed more than amused me.

However, the laughs we get from Baymax are genuine.  This robot is pretty funny as he is going well outside his original programming, and that clash if wonderful.  Plus theres a scene as his battery is dying that is hysterical.  Disney was smart to market the movie around him because he is wonderful.

As the movie progresses, we get some more dark and emotional moments, but the film has earned them by this point because of the story and characters weve gotten to know.  The mix of light and dark winds up working well here to further pull us into the story.

The voice cast is wonderful.  While I do recognize a few names, most of them are unknown to me, but that doesnt make their work any less impressive.  In fact, I like the fact that Disney casts the best voice for a part and doesnt rely on big names to bring in an audience.  Anyway, you will get lost in the story as the actors do amazing jobs bringing their characters to life.

Likewise, the animation is top notch.  There are a few beautiful shots and another few wonderfully fun sequences.  A lot of work went into making this movie, and it shows.

While this movie is not part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe, it does have a final scene after the credits, so be sure to sit through them.

If Id realized this was Marvel going into the film, I would have had different expectations and might have loved it as much as everyone else seemed to love it.  As it is, I did enjoy Big Hero 6 even if I didn't love it.",1435104000,,3755,4.225035161744023

It's one of the first Disney films I've seen that has realistic occurrences considering the rapid advancement of technology. No magic here. No talking toys. Just a boy and his robot, but so much more! I saw little advertising for this movie, and what I did see made me not want to view the film. Boy was I wrong about it. Good voice acting, great animation, good plot. The very end was okay, not how I would have ended the movie, but still decent. You will laugh, and cry, and really think about the human heart, and how at the end of the day, we have free will to make choices. If someone else chooses unwisely and does something to affect your life, you have the choice to make a wise decision instead of a foolish one. Hiro is the real star of the film because he makes some tough and courageous decisions though at first he is compelled to do the wrong thing. It further solidifies my belief that kids are kids, but we should treat them like developing adults. They are so much more intelligent, and capable of understanding than we are led to believe. I am more impressed with Hiro's understanding and emotional maturity than I am with the fact that he is a child prodigy. Disney let's him be a kid, but also gives him the opportunity to shine as a young adult as well. It pokes fun at his transition (puberty), but throughout the movie to the last thirty minutes you see him come to the other side of his journey into adulthood ; it's just the beginning really, but it makes me hope for an equally impressive sequel with an older Hiro. Go watch this film. Even if you don't love it, you'll like it.",1434758400,,1705,4.381703470031546

6716267,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Not surprisingly, I don't watch as many animated films as I used to, with all the kiddies grown up.  Still, there are so many great ""movies"" that were animated, I still watch my fair share, but usually at home.  ""Big Hero 6"" won the Oscar for the best animated film of 2014 and deservedly so.

Set in the fictitious, blended city of San Fransokyo, our teen hero, Hiro (Ryan Potter) spends most of his time taking his 1-foot robot into back alley robot fights.  He wins, but he's bored.  His older brother Tadash (Daniel Henney) works at Cal Tech and wants Hiro to apply there.  The fact that he's a bit young doesn't stop him so he competes in a tech show which garners him attention of the school's dean.

As things appear to be headed in the right direction, disaster strikes and Hiro goes into depression and seclusion, even dodging his new friends at the school.  By accident Hiro uncovers the robotic nurse created by Tadash.  Baymax (Scott Adsit) looks like a cross between the Pillsbury doughboy and Robby the Robot from ""Forbidden Planet"" and TV's ""Lost in Space.""  He has magical powers of detection, analysis and diagnosis.

Baymax manages to bring Hiro out of his funk and he reunites with his college crew (voices by T. J. Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr. and Genesis Rodriguez) after he finds out a corporate giant headed by Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk) has stolen the pet project that got him into college.  The brilliant Hiro devises super tech tricks which creates a band of superheroes from his friends and Baymax.  Hiro and his pals are out to bring Krei to justice, but is he the only villain out there?

This is one of those nicely scripted stories that matches up to the brilliant animation by the Disney Studios and fine direction by Don Hall and Chris Williams.  The movie has heart, humor and heroes.  What more could you ask for. Highly recommended but use discretion with small children as far as content.

Let's face it, the majority of modern animated films look great on the big screen and more than ever on the small ones, thanks to perfectly adapted transfers to Blu ray.  This one is as good as it gets.  Using a 1080p video resolution, the film comes with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It is gloriously colorful with deep blacks throughout.  Wonderful detail shows the care the animators used with small items like buttons, clothing and electronic do-dads.  The audio is likewise of reference quality.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 has a great display throughout the soundstage with excellent dynamic range.  Yet the audio doesn't overwhelm the senses.  Dialog is directionally accurate and intelligible.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Here are the extras:
*Theatrical Short Feast
*Deleted Scenes
*Big Animator 6: The Characters Behind the Characters
*The Origin Story of ""Big Hero 6"": Hiro's Journey (hosted by Jamie Chung, voice of Go Go Tomago)
*Big Hero Secrets (Easter Egg)",1434499200,3,2938,4.789264413518887

When we originally saw it in the theater our 3 year old son reacted to the ending exactly the same way I did when my dad took me to the Original Star Wars at the same age, but I won't spoil the ending by saying more than that.  One word of warning, our son runs around now yelling ""He's gonna kill us!"" which is something new, but we're not too concerned.",1434499200,,430,4.095238095238095

In short, this is a superhero movie. And the huggable, lovable robot Baymax steals the show. Every character is developed very well, they aren't just cut-out characters. Even the baddie has a good story behind him. This is a must-watch movie. There's some action movie violence, but it's very cartoony.

6716405,2,B00O4ZC57I,"Ok, firstly, I had thought a specific studio made this.  After I watched the movie, I looked at the box and realized that it was not the one I thought.  That really explained everything.

Let us talk about what I liked.  The backgrounds.  The city, the towns, they looked amazing.  Some of the best animation I have ever seen.

That is really it.

So, what did I not like?

First, while the backgrounds and those things looked amazing, the characters were a step or two down.  They just did not look very good.  Now, if the rest of the movie had looked like the characters, I do not think it would have mattered.  But, when you have part of an animation looking amazing, you had better have the entire thing look like that.

The story.

Well, in the previews and from everything I had seen on this movie, I had the impression that this was a movie about a boy and a robot.  The fun they had and the trouble they got into.  That could not be farther from the truth.  In reality, the movie is about a tragic event that affects the boy.  He then realizes that he has the robot and the boy tries to find out what happened.  The problem with this is, I did not at all care.  Things move way to fast in this movie.  You get no time to really have any feelings for the characters.  Then, they add more characters to the mix.  You have like 5 people and a robot, trying to figure something out.  It just did not fit at all.  While you never had a chance to get any emotions for the boy or the robot, you had even less time to think or care about the other characters.

Also, the names of the characters did not fit.  They looked American, but their names were, I believe Japanese.  Also, some of the scenes, it seemed as if the race of the character would change for a moment.  Just for a second, its like, the face changed.  They should have done a better job with that.  I can only imagine, and I could be wrong, that this was made in another place, with characters that fit that place.  If that is true, than if they did not want to spend the time or money localizing the characters, they should have left them as they were.

Then, at like, the forty or fifty minute left portion of the film, it just started to drag on and on.  It kind of went of course from what you think it will be and almost became another movie.  All the previews you see are not at all what the movie is.  It is like they baited you with the look of a fun, family comedy, with a heart-warming story, but in fact gave you a dull, sad, pointless mess.

If I had rented this and watched, I would never think of buying it or watching it again.  It just really has no point.  Emotionless characters.  No story.  Is kind of all over the place and at no point got my attention at all.  Waste of time if you ask me.  If you want to see this movie, I would highly suggest that you rent it first.

I am writing this, the day after the movie.  I wrote this first part at like, 1am.  Haha The movie just did not flow at all.  They did not seem to spend enough time on any kind of story that built up.  You just never really care.  The end, what even worse.  I now have the feeling that I watched a stupid movie, just to be set up for another movie that is about the back-story of the first.  Make sense?  haha",1433548800,,3266,4.078988941548183

It may be a *slightly* emotionally manipulative movie, I still loved it.  The movie looks gorgeous, the characters are funny, and Baymax is like WALL-E's personality covered in marshmallow fluff.  But when he gently says ""Are you satisfied with your care,"" I'm bawling.

The steelbook itself is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen and was well worth the extra money to acquire.

Baymax - ""I am not fast.""
Me - ""I hear you buddy.""",1433462400,,598,4.4495412844036695
6716416,3,B00O4ZC57I,"This is a somewhat fun and engaging film, but I have to admit it is a prime example of hype surpassing actuality.  Now, I say that without being familiar with the comic book.  It's really not a unique story or even that creative of a plot, even the animation is pretty status quo compared to its competing CGI ilk.  The characters are quaint and enjoyable but feel very two dimensional as opposed to other films of its quality.  This is especially disappointing as one of the directors was responsible for one of the best animated features of the decade, the icy cool and creative sister act called Frozen.  In the end, I giggled, slightly cheered, and happily followed along, but when all was said and done and the credits rolled, I kinda felt an overwhelming sense of Meh.  It wasn't a bad film, it was just a good film, nothing more or less.  But please stay until the end of the credits for a heartwarming animated short that far exceeds its feature in heart, soul, and storytelling and in a fraction of the time.

My children and I decided that it was also a mish-mash of a lot of other popular movies (Iron man meets Fantastic Four  . . . and a lot of other elements that will have you thinking, ""Oh, that reminds me of . . ."").

Andrews 3D Blu-ray Review: Happiness Is a Warm Robot and Disney's Animation division takes a little-known Marvel Comic Book and reinvents it from the ground up, building a superhero buddy animation film around a lovable robot called Baymax.

With BIG HERO 6, which is an obscure Marvel Comics title gives, the Walt Disney Animation division just enough raw material to assemble its own superhero franchise, starring millions of robots and including one, a balloon-bellied virtual nurse named Baymax, that youll never forget. Co-directors Don Hall and Chris Williams borrow the character names and a few key details from their pulp source, but otherwise succeed in putting a thoroughly Disney spin on things, delivering appealing personalities, bright, peppy animation, positive life lessons and what looks like a world record for the sheer amount of hugging featured in a superhero animation film. More male-skewing than FROZEN, the relatively hip result has done big business for Disney, especially in Asian territories, with additional films, comics or even a TV series.

Set in a beautifully rendered, futuristic hybrid city called San Fransokyo, which combines familiar NorCal features, like steep hills, the Golden Gate Bridge and the bay, with skyscrapers, neon signs and characteristically Japanese architectural flourishes where Big Hero 6 synthesises American and Asian cultural sensibilities across the board. Displaying a special love for Japanese robotics, screenwriters Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson and Jordan Roberts integrate elements of manga, anime and science fiction into the very fabric of the computer-animated project, but also succumb to the same pitfalls faced by so many other superhero pics: Namely, after establishing its fresh and relatable origin story, the movie gets bogged down with a relatively generic villains power-hungry schemes.

Hiro is crazy-smart for a kid his age, who is an amateur inventor with a special interest in robotics, he graduated from high school at 13 and now spends his time hustling bigger fish at underground bot-fighting competitions and a hobby that jumpstarts the high-energy story with a few Real Steel style scenes early on. Older brother Tadashi [Daniel Henney] wishes Hiro would pick something safer to occupy his time, arranging an impromptu tour of the university science lab in hopes that the teen might be tempted to enrol.

Pay special attention to the four inventors who work alongside Tadashi in the school lab, since they will soon join Hiros band of amateur crime-fighters. These misfits include cycling junkie GoGo Tamago [Jamie Chung]; laser-blade innovator Wasabi [Damon Wayans Jr.]; chemical-reactions specialist Honey Lemon [Genesis Rodriguez] and Fred [T.J. Miller], a shaggy-haired weirdo obsessed with Godzilla and other freak-of-nature phenomena. As a group, they come across less like the Avengers than the dorky members of Scooby-Doos mystery-solving squad.

With his squeaky inflatable suit and gentle demeanour, Baymax looks like a cross between the Marshmallow Man and a giant panda. Personality-wise, the benign bot represents an extreme case of Asimovs first law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. In his naive, uniquely amusing way, Baymax is hyper-attentive, almost to the point of smothering, dispensing lollipops and hugs as the situation demands. But hes also a quick study, learning as he goes, which makes the animation film feel a bit like How to Train Your Robot for the first hour or so, complete with high-flying bonding sequences that take us throughout the elaborate, densely detailed world of San Fransokyo is in dynamic stereoscopic 3D, no less.

The villain, who hides his identity behind a kabuki mask, and the members of Hiros wisecracking team all remain recognisable human characters throughout. Theyre not suddenly blessed with imaginary new powers or miraculously transformed by gamma rays, like so many other Marvel types. Instead, the film eliminates the stigma of being a nerd and illustrating how college-level intelligence gave them the tools to make themselves special, boasting a few useful lessons on anger management and the futility of vengeance in the process.

Though much of the animation film is funny, some young viewers may be unsettled by its dark undertones. Death and loss are woven throughout in familiar Disney fashion. Hiro sometimes endures levels of heartbreak, but eventually overcomes the sad part of his life with his 5 other buddy heros. The villain, too, is a slight disappointment, but not in a negative way, especially for those old enough to maybe guess his identity. But between the well-conceived leads, inventive action scenes and awesome gadgets, there is plenty of compensation for these complaints. Don Hall and Chris Williams have given us one of those rare family films that can fairly boast of having it all: humour, heart and hug ability. Seriously, place your order for a stuffed Baymax now and definitely the 3D Blu-ray disc, as you will not be disappointed and I have already watched the 3D animation film twice that is how good it is. I give it a massive 5 star rating.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  BIG HERO 6 has an awesome 1080p encoded transfer, which comes just as expected, and is totally awesome. The 2.39:1 aspect ratio framed image is so beautifully display of digital artistry. Clarity is really even and stretches to the screen's limits in every shot. Details are exacting across the board. Whether minor little bits like scuffed armour, the worn edges a long a well-read comic book, or general city textures, the image features a collection of precise details that never relent in their display of perfection, or at least, every last little bit of digital magic born of the filmmakers' hands and computers. Even Baymax's puffy white vinyl body finds some excellent, albeit extremely subtle, textural nuance. Black levels are appropriately deep and textured, to make it totally awesome looking.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  BIG HERO 6 features an awesome and precise 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The track is all about balance. It's aggressive but never to excess, finding subtleties in presentation and placement that are reserved for the absolute best tracks. Music, for example, never overpowers the aural senses but does play with a healthy volume, wide spacing, and gentle surround support. The bass is tight and deep but again never overextends its welcome. The aforementioned action scenes enjoy a significant amount of activity, none of which unnecessarily dominates or covers up either key elements or minor support bits. Dialogue is true and centre focused with a nice bit of light reverberation when necessary. This is a definite reference track from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in every regard.

3D and 2D Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Academy Award Winning Disney Theatrical Short: FEAST [2014] [1080p] [2.39:1] [6:12] As an amusing bonus BIG HERO 6 which is a virtually dialogue-free, roughly six-minute short called FEAST. In a fun twist, the film is told as a montage of meals, tracking a dozen years in the relationship between a Boston terrier and his owner, as seen from the insatiably hungry dogs perspective. Technically speaking, this is an experimental short, in its visual style and its narrative approach, and it takes a bit of time to get ones bearings, but the emotional core is so strong that we cant help choking up. If director Patrick Osborne can do that in six minutes with Feast, perhaps its fair to ask more of the feature that follows. You can either watch it in 3D or with the second Blu-ray disc, in 2D, your choice, but I preferred to watch it in 3D.

Special Feature: The Origin Story of Big Hero 6: Hiros Journey [2014] [1080p] [16:9] [15:10] When you start viewing this particular extra, Baymax comes towards the screen warns you that there will be spoilers in this segment. Obviously you have by now watched the animation film. Jamie Chung [Go Go] hosts and takes us on a journey and we meet all the other contributors. We hear from Don Hall [Director]; Chris Williams [Director]; Roy Conli [Producer]; Paul Briggs [Head of Story]; Robert L. Bair [Writer]; Daniel Gerson [Writer]; Joe Mateo [Head of Story]; Michael Kaschalk [Head of Effects Animation]; Shiyoon Kim [Lead Character Designer]; Scott Adsit [Baymax]; Paul Felix [Production Designer] and Adolph Lusinsky [Director of Cinematography and Lighting]. There are a lot of views of the locations in San Francisco. Joe Quesada [Chief Creative officer for Marvel Entertainment] and Jeph Loeb [Executive Vice President Head of Marvel Television] helped guide the story from a Marvel Comic into a Disney Animated film by adding more of the element of Hiros brother. Jeph Loeb mentions how at Marvel Comics, they write a script and shoot it. John Lasseter and his team really dive in and work through elements over and over along the way until they get what they want. They looked at upcoming technology to figure out Baymaxs design. A lot of time was spent thinking about Hiros first flight scene with Baymax. Theres talk on designing the city. Jeph Loeb talks about the feeling of great loss. How Hiro dealt with his brothers death. Taking emotional ideas and helping people connect with them. As long as we keep telling stories about the people that we lost, they will never go away. We also get introduced to a new computer process called Disneys Hyperion Renderer and it captures a realistic street lighting effect sensation. One bit of nice information we also hear about, is how they were able to capture the face of Byamax and we are informed that it was based on some bells in a Japanese Temple and it is amazing such a simple solution was resolved. So all in all this is a nice special feature, with lots of informative information and is a definite must watch.

Special Feature: Big Animator 6: The Characters Behind The Characters [2014] [1080p] [1.77:1] [6:39] Here we get a talk and listen with all the animators sitting in a circle in a room and they are Zach Parrish [Head of Animation]; Doug Bennett [Animation Supervisor]; Nathan Engelhard [Animation Supervisor]; Jason Figliozzi [Animation Supervisor]; Michael Franceschi [Animation Supervisor]. They discuss how and where they got the ideas from for little details in the characters looks and moves. Some had brothers and put some of those things into the animation film. There is also a look at some of the voice actors, which includes Daniel Henney [Tadashi]; Ryan Potter [Hiro]; Mya Rudolph [Cass]; Jamie Chung [Go Go]; Damon Wayans Jr. [Wasabi]; Gnesis Rodrguez [Honey Lemon]; T.J. Miller [Fred] and Scott Adsit [Byamax]. They had to make sure each character had their own way of moving about and carrying themselves. There's a lot of great insight here. It's too bad this wasn't longer, especially with the lack of actual commentary during the film. So all in all a very fascinating special feature and well worth viewing.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams [2014] [1080p] Introductions by directors Don Hall and Chris Williams. Theres two alternate openings, with one was a prologue, a scene with Yokais crew, and Every Great Super Hero Origin Story Starts with a Grappling Hook. They're all storyboard clips but will give you an idea of what could have been. You can also see, like with the prologue, how the clip would have changed the tone of the story.

Theatrical Trailer: [2014] [1080p [2.39:1] [1:40] This is the Original Theatrical Teaser Trailer for BIG HERO 6. But what a shame this was not included on the 3D Blu-ray disc.

Special Feature: Disney Animated Special: Mickey Mouse in Tokyo Go [2013] [1080p] [1.77:1] [3:47] This is is supposed to be a homage to animations earlier years, Tokyo Go is a madcap adventure told without a single line of dialogue, but I think it is a right load of old rubbish. Mickey fights crazy commuting crowds aboard the bullet train in Tokyo, Japan. Set among Japans famously fast commuter trains and rendered with a retro, illustrated style, this slapstick short definitely doesnt need any words to get its story across. Also after he escapes, he jumps of the train and you can see ducks from Duck Hunt. When Mickey goes through a tunnel on top of the train, the scene briefly changes to that of a video game. This is a possible cultural reference to Akihabara, a section of Tokyo which is a hot spot for gamers. It is also a reference to Yo Gabba Gabba! Sadly I felt this animation cartoon was rather crude and I did not like the style of animation at all and if this is the route Mickey Mouse is going in the future, and then I can definitely give it a zero rating. Animators, please bring back the proper original stylised professionally drawn Mickey Mouse, as this one was total rubbish.

Sneak Previews: Here we get to see Three specific trailers and they are: Ratatouille: Adventure at DisneyLand, Paris [2014] [1080p] [1.77:1] [00:37]; Disney Infinity Computer Game [2014] [1080] [1.77:1] [00:30] and Inside Out [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [1:34]. With the Cinema Trailer Inside Out, you can view it either in 3D or 2D, but at the start of this trailer you get view clips from previous PIXAR Animation films that are now shown in 3D for the first time, that was only available in 2D, like A Bugs Life, The Incredibles and Wall-E. So does that mean Disney/PIXAR will eventually release those particular Titles onto a 3D Blu-ray disc, wow I hope so, as that would be absolutely fantastic.

BONUS: A Beautiful Designed Embossed Slip Cover.

Finally, if you are a fan of animated films, like me, you will definitely want BIG HERO 6 in your Blu-ray Collection, especially the 3D Blu-ray disc. Some more extra special features would have been nice, but we do have some excellent extras included. It is an animation film you can easily watch over and over again. It's a great family animation film with lots of moments that do get a little dark and heavy. You will laugh and cry in a very nice emotional way. And hopefully we will get a sequel soon? Don't forget the after-the-credits have rolled up the screen, do not miss the extra bonus scene right at the end, especially if you missed it right to the end in the cinema and obviously there is a hint that there will be in the not too distant future a follow up BIG HERO 6 animation film. BIG HERO 6 is the perfect animated film. It's packed with action, littered with strong characters, teeming with humour, and overflowing with heart. It's the epitome of the modern animated film and the superhero picture alike, standing tall against anything either side can throw at it and brushing off any unfounded criticism even the most jaded viewers may hurl in its direction. Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have a modern masterpiece on their hands. Very Highly Recommended!

6716454,3,B00O4ZC57I,Not as visually interesting as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Not as original from as FROZEN. Dialogue not as well written as TANGLED. There were some touching moments. And I did enjoy the Tokyo/San Fransisco city that was created for the film. I think that audiences - at least me - have come to expect more than the paint by numbers outline they wrote this script around. It was like maybe the writers thought - Hey! - must do the Disney stand-by and kill off a beloved character within 20mins of the start of the film - then were watching Power Rangers & Scooby Doo while writing the rest of the movie...,1433203200,,598,4.396396396396397

The animation can be really sharp (the landscapes especially are rendered with incredible detail, especially the sequences where the big robot is flying over the city) but yet at the same time the characters look artificial, and a few of them even look like recycled Elsa models (the mother-character, for instance, looks like Elsa with darker hair and a few wrinkles added. In fact most of the female characters have that 'Frozen'-style rabbit-like facial quality.) The story was cute but ridiculously predictable and the characters shallow. But I'll give credit that there were a couple laughs (including the end credit cameo by Stan The Man) but it just wasn't enough to salvage this one for me. Kids will enjoy it, adults will be better served by multi-tasking and doing something else more interesting like filing taxes...",1431820800,2,854,5.107142857142857

6716830,3,B00O4ZC57I,"Wd give this movie a 5 for the animation, concept & characters BaymaX & the nerd kids. Such a missed opportunity, however, in the storyline & adult characters. (Spoiler alert) As orphans being cared for by their cool Aunt, Hiro's inspiration of an older brother DIES in the first part of the movie & so does Baymax at the end. Why?!? The next-in-line would-be mentor (who also pretends to die) turns out to live only for revenge. It seems like the intent of the writers was to weave in an unexpected twist by NOT making the evil entrepreneur the obvious bad guy but in doing so, they sacrificed any redeeming qualities in those key characters and lost what could've been a much richer cumulative outcome. There are many amazing, amusing & very charming, high quality aspects in the animation & friendships between Baymax & the nerd kids but (to me) they are shamefully wasted & overshadowed by the depressing undertones & tragic deaths. Disney-Pixar has done better.",1431734400,,966,4.790419161676646

6716839,5,B00O4ZC57I,"My children love this movie. Baymax and Hiro have become household icons and they watch this movie repeatedly. There are two parts that were very disturbing to them... The brother, Tadashi, dies in this Disney film. I am not sure why this part was so necessary since it adds heartache without much power to the story. The children kept hoping that Tadashi would have been saved and reappear through the futuristic portal. I have to agree with my kids, that this part of the story was disappointing and rather unnecessary to introduce small children to sibling losses. Wasn't it enough for Disney to have the two brothers without parents??? This borders on the traumatic childhood memories of Bambi's mother being killed by hunters, and Dumbo being wrenched from his mother as a baby... I think young viewers should be prepared for this.
Otherwise, the action, humor and character development in the film is outstanding. Very enjoyable and engaging for all ages. Definitely takes you through a myriad of emotions. We are still enjoying it after over 100 repeat viewings, but we fast-forward through the death of Tadashi...

Big Hero 6 is a film you can take most of the family to and just about everyone will find something to connect to.  The plot may be a bit on the predictable side at times, but there are still surprises laced throughout.  The world the characters inhabit feels enough real world to relate to but at the same time also has surprises and nods to other worldly things.  The voice acting is superb as expected.  The graphics are fun and colorful.  Even when there are easy outs, both the filmmakers and the characters do not shy away from making difficult choices.

However, for really young or sensitive children, be alert to the fact that there are a couple of sad scenes. They' re handled well, but it doesn't negate the fact that some children may be upset.  Beyond that, the overall tone of the movie is uplifting and positive, and it ends happily.",1431648000,,442,4.419753086419753

6716930,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I am in love with this movie.

I'll admit there are some pretty predictable plot points, but that's just because I'm incredibly used to the superhero genre.

The movie, by itself, is a great origin story. It focuses on heavy themes, such as mortality and revenge, and doesn't spoonfeed any lessons to the audience.

This is a great movie to start with, if you want to get someone into the whole superhero boom.

The comedy relief, mostly from Baymax and Fred, are great. Nothing too series or childish.

Best of all, this movie gets kids excited about the possibility of science, which is a huge plus.",1431475200,,601,4.632075471698113

My son has enjoyed quizzing me on whether or not I saw the references to and from other movies throughout Big Hero 6.  And as we have discovered with most animated films, the more you watch it the more you catch.  It is a fun, warm hearted look at the moods and emotions of a single character surrounded by a small group of supporting characters in a robotics based imaginative futuristic city.  As seems to be the current trend in family based films, the villain is not necessarily a person and good versus evil is more a case of determining what is right and acceptable.",1431302400,,723,4.333333333333333

A school project just came up where the kids in his class had to build toy robots out of common household parts.  My son and I, using foam shapes, built the battlebot from the beginning of this film.  When we brought it in to school, all the kids in his class went nutts.  They all recognized it - apparently his entire class is in love with this film.

As for the film itself, it does a great job a tackling some deep emotional topics with incredible tact and to great effect.  There are several very important lessons to be learned from this film.  I would recommend it to anyone, at any time, of any age.

6717235,4,B00O4ZC57I,"I don't quite know what to say about this movie. It has a high production value, the characters are likable, but at the same time I cannot help but feel the directors dropped the ball.

To avoid spoilers, the directors don't appear to have ever had a clear vision of what their product was going to be. They've admitted to changing some scenes very late in production and even to the Stan Lee cameo as a last minute, rushed addition to the movie. I sit through it and I see some plot holes that break established continuity and in the end, I don't feel satisfied with the ending.

The movie IS still a worthwhile watch, but beware its not as fulfilling as other animated features (How to Train Your Dragon 2, the Box Trolls, etc). That were released around the same time. I think maybe the sequel will be a more satisfying movie.",1430611200,,829,4.411764705882353

The story touches on some mature themes, and it definitely had my son in tears at the end (my 4 year old daughter watched this at home and also cried at the end), but it deals with loss in way that kids can understand without overly traumatizing them.  Of course the majority of the film was filled with good humor, fast-paced superhero action and very likable characters.  Although CG animated movies seem to be the norm these days, it does a great job of separating itself from the pack and delivers quite a very captivating story with characters you can certainly empathize with.  Overall a very fun ride and definitely worth repeated viewing.  Recommended.",1430352000,,764,4.580882352941177

Standard DVD/Blu-ray combo packaging in a Blu-ray (blue) case. DVD is on the left, Blu-ray on the right. Code included for digital copy via Disney Movies Anywhere. I downloaded it on our PC and iPad without issues.

Review of the movie:
As a parent, I thought the emotional journey of the main character in this movie would be too intense/sad/complicated for my kids (3, 7, 8) to understand and process. Wrong! They LOVE this movie, with a vengeance. Okay, maybe the 3-yr-old doesn't understand the emotion, but he loves ""Baymax"" and my two girls appreciate the emotional struggle with good winning out in the end.

For adults, this movie is witty and my kids can watch it on repeat without driving me crazy. I also appreciate they're actually learning something about right/wrong, social skills, friendship, loyalty, dealing with depression and grief, etc. instead of just watching colorful animated whoozits for an hour. Bonus - watch (or fast-forward) to the very end of the credits. Fred's dad should look familiar.",1430092800,,1042,5.017341040462428

6717495,3,B00O4ZC57I,"It's not a bad story, and has some funny and heartfelt moments, but I was frustrated that terrible design flaws in Beymax were kept solely for marketing and product sales. It makes sense for Baymax to be puffy as a health care consultant, but once he becomes a Hero it's a serious problem to be a blow-up doll.  The only reason for it is to create a cute doll to sell to kids, and that's a terrible reason to change plot points.",1429920000,,428,4.219512195121951

Regardless, could this robot look any worse?  What is that the Michelin Man?  The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?  Oh no wait... it's Baymax, the dumbest looking robot in history.

I don't know.... maybe I'm just crazy... I just preferred it when you could actually make a cartoon with cool looking characters and designs.  Now we get some gender-neutral blob robot that doesn't even have any cool weapons because... you know... you could NEVER actually have guns in a movie... at least not anymore.

This thing is so stupid looking that it reminds me of some past Olympic mascots.  Have you ever looked at an Olympic mascot?  They are some of the lamest designs in the history of mankind.  Rule number one is to make it completely non-offensive.  There is no rule number two because rule number one guarantees it will suck and no one will remember it anyway.",1429660800,7,961,4.654761904761905

6717596,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Mainly it is just fun to watch as mindless entertainment when you want to just turnoff and enjoy something which does not require a lot of thought. The main theme in the plot is the relationship which develops between Hiro and Baymax as Hiro works through the grieving process. This gives the movie an emotional handle to hold the audience's interest. Worked in with this is a lot of humor just to keep the mood light despite the death and grieving which are constantly present. I am guessing the  target audience is late preteens.

The character development for Hiro and Baymax is better than you might normally expect for a children's cartoon, but the other characters have almost no development. Don't go into it looking for something exceptional, but if you have children around 8 to 11 and want to find something you can watch with them without being bored out of your mind this could be what you are looking for.",1429660800,,918,4.660493827160494

I've said this many times, Disney and Pixar are the best storytellers in the world, and this movie is a great example of that. My 5-year-old son also love the film. He talks about Baymax all the time. The dark depictions of the antagonist, a robotically-enhanced, masked, evil-doer, are a little intense for him and he will often come to me for security and support when we watch the movie, but he really gets into the plot of the movie. He even notes that the loss of a character near the end of the movie makes him sad (no spoilers here), but admits that he's happy at the final scenes.

The spirit of Tadashi Hamada really does live on in Baymax. Be prepared to cry a little.",1429488000,,888,4.613924050632911

6717699,5,B00O4ZC57I,"this came out around the same time as tinkerbell neverbeast. Both movies try to tug on your heartstrings and show the main character struggle with such life challenges. However unlike neverbeast this movie was sincere and warm. the scary moments were well played out and rationale such that though my kids were scared, they didn't have nightmares all night (which unfortunately neverbeast did do).

There are truly funny moments that we still laugh about when we think back on this movie.

The scenes near the ending brought tears to my eyes and show a strong and good human spirit. It inspires you to want to do good and to cherish those close to you. It gave me lots of opportunities to talk to my kids about adult-type issues and situations.

6717725,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I wasn't really expecting this movie to be very good.  I mean a robot that is all soft and squishy and friendly trying to fight a super powered bad guy doesnt seem like hed be very effective or very interesting.  However the movie did get great reviews and I decided I would give it a fair shot.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Right away I want to say the animation is top notch, the characters all look unique and everything looks incredible!

Now what can I say about the story?  Well its Disney so of course the kids parents are dead, and of course he loses someone close to him during the movie.  Lets face it, Disney loves to kill off family members of main characters either on screen or in their backstories.

So Hiros brother (Tadashi), is killed in an explosion and Hiro uses his brothers robot, Baymax to hunt down and bring the one responsible for the explosion to justice.  He also recruits his brothers college buddies to help him in his endeavor.  There are a lot of little jokes scattered throughout the movie that make you laugh and also some good action and fight scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat.

The villain in the story that Hiro is trying to fight actually has a great motivation for his character and in a way you almost want to root for him.

The story ends with our heroes of course bringing the villain to justice and striking a Power Rangers pose at the very end as they declare they intend to fight crime and bring justice to the city of San Fransokyo where they live.

Also make sure you stay until the end of the credits for a great little post-credits scene!

All in all its a great movie for kids, adults, fans of action, comic book fans, animation fans, and everyone else as well.  If you have the time and can find a copy, its certainly worth watching.

This is beautifully executed Disney animated fare with a refreshing edge.  The girls in the group are engineers, not princesses. Sometimes the line between good and bad gets blurry. Hiro makes some mistakes.  Even Bay Max has a dark side. But together the friends solve the problem of the man in the Kabuki mask.",1429401600,,586,4.605769230769231

Luckily we use whatever moments to teach our children slowly about the world.  Themes this movie brought up included losing loved ones to bad things, initial reactions/emotions, bad responses to things that happen to us, better responses to things that happen to us, asking for/needing help when dealing with strong emotions (like grief), and having to live with the consequences of actions you make.",1429401600,,596,4.881188118811881

6717784,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I'm tempted to say that children's movies or family oriented movies are getting better, but that would be tantamount to outright dismissing gems like The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, The Secret of N.I.M.H, and so many other fantastic movies from my own childhood. So, even though the movies today might not actually be better as far as subject content and narrative are concerned, there are a lot more of them...and that makes me happy.
Big Hero 6, which I just watched last night, was both sweet and adorable while simultaneously poignant with its handling of difficult subjects like the death of close family members and the grieving process. My favorite thematic element would be the focus on science and engineering as positive and pleasurable hobbies and occupations for children to pursue, a sentiment that is sadly underrepresented in the world today.
Much like Frozen, Despicable Me, and Monsters Inc., there isn't much that I could complain about where Big Hero 6 is concerned. The animation, like so often anymore, was fantastic and the cast of voice actors brought life to even the less pivotal characters on screen.
Like most, if not all of the family friendly movies coming out, this isn't just for children and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age, I think.",1429315200,,1309,4.954545454545454

However, knowing Disney's past patterns, I kinda expected an entertaining movie, but one that was too trendy to have lasting appeal.  I don't think I could have been more wrong.  Big Hero 6 manages to capture the heart and soul of Disney's greatest classics, and inject it into a modern (or rather futuristic) setting in a way I haven't seen them achieve before.

6717953,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I admit to having my reservations when this movie came out.  It was so enormously hyped that I thought there was no way it could live up to it, no matter how good it was.  I'd experienced similar disappointment with a few other movies recently -- ""Frozen"" was good but I'm quickly growing sick of it thanks to Disney shoving it in our faces at every opportunity, and ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" while decent, didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.  While ""Big Hero 6"" wasn't as relentlessly marketed as ""Frozen,"" it got its fair share of advertising, and I'd heard so many critics and viewers gush about the movie that I feared I'd go see the movie and end up disappointed.  And so I waited until it hit DVD before borrowing it from the library for a viewing of my own.  If it ended up not living up to my expectations, at least I wouldn't be out much, right?

I should have had more faith in the film.  It's easily one of the best Disney/Marvel team-ups, and one of their best recent animated films.

The film follows Hiro Hamada, a young robotics genius in the technologically advanced city of San Frantokyo (which is exactly as it sounds -- a mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo), who lives with his aunt and idolizes his older brother Tadashi.  Tadashi convinces him to follow in his footsteps and join a prestigious tech school... but at the science exhibition where Hiro tries to promote his new invention and get into the school, a fire breaks out and Tadashi is killed trying to save his professor from the inferno.  Saddened by the loss of his brother but determined to discover who's responsible for his death -- as well as who stole his invention and is using it to become a supervillain -- Hiro teams up with Baymax, an enormous but gentle medical-assistant robot designed by his brother, as well as with his brother's friends from school -- the bubbly chemist Honey Lemon, the tough and action-oriented mechanics engineer GoGo, the brilliant but neurotic plasma engineer Wasabi, and the goofy school mascot Fred.  But when the identity of their enemy is revealed, it forces Hiro to re-evaluate his plan for revenge... and inspires the team to use their genius to become superheroes.

The film looks amazing, with gorgeous shots of the city of San Frantokyo -- which draws plenty of inspiration from both its namesakes, though I noticed it tends to look more like San Francisco during the day and more like Tokyo at night.  Disney outdid itself on the animation, providing slick designs and movements and unique facial features for almost all its characters, even the background extras.  The villain (who goes nameless in the film until their identity is revealed) is especially well-done, his stolen technology giving him almost a shapeshifter look and fluid, eldritch-looking attacks.  And there are plenty of visual gags to spot in this film -- see if you can spot Hans from ""Frozen"" and Flynn Rider from ""Tangled"" in various places.

The characters are a fun bunch as well.  It's hard not to relate to Hiro, and many kids who feel out of their element at school or home will identify with him.  Baymax, though a robot and a fairly static character, is adorable, and is the source of much of the film's humor without being a goofy slapstick character -- he's simply funny being himself.  Wasabi, Honey, GoGo, and Fred are hard not to like as well, with varied personalities that don't fall into the stereotypical molds one tends to find in superhero teams in comics and other media.  I have to admit to liking Fred the best -- even though he has a typical ""stoned loser"" look and attitude, there are more layers to him than one would guess, and seeing as I have a soft spot for Kaiju, his monster-themed superhero outfit and powers appeal to me greatly.

Under all the action and visual style, however, this film has a genuine heart.  It tackles big themes for a Disney movie, such as revenge and its consequences... and is one of the best depictions of grief and the grieving process I've seen yet in an animated film.  At first I questioned whether this film deserved the Best Animated Picture award at the Oscars, but now I don't question it -- it has emotional depth to it that I genuinely enjoyed.  ""How To Train Your Dragon 2,"" which came out the same year, also featured the death of someone close to the main character, but it treated the subject almost as an afterthought, while ""Big Hero 6"" treated the subject with respect and wasn't afraid to make it the driving force of the movie.  And where many Disney movies tend to use dead family members as little more than a plot device, it was nice to see one not take the subject lightly.

Note -- watch the credits all the way to the end, or at least fast-forward to the end.  There's a final stinger at the end of the credits that's extra-hilarious, and helps tie this movie into the Marvel Universe.  It's nothing huge, but it's still fun to watch.

A fun and heartfelt animated movie, and a refreshing antidote to the ""Frozen"" craze that seems to permeate all things Disney anymore.  Perfect for kids who might still be too young for ""Avengers"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" though I'd be careful showing it to children younger than 8, as there's still some violence and scary imagery.",1428969600,2,5260,4.6126609442060085

6717961,5,B00O4ZC57I,"If you're like me and love a good Marvel story then this movie is for you!

Big Hero 6 started in the early 2000s, or 90s, when Marvel was branching out into Japan. BH6 is essentially Japans version of the Avengers.
BH6 members are underpowered in comparison to their comic book counterparts.
For instance:
-The blonde girl is seriously underpowered, her real ability is the infinite purse, which contains an alternate dimension which lets her use or have pretty much anything she can think of.
-Sunfire and Sunpyre are NOT in the team.
  -Sunfire and Sunpyre, Sunpyre replaced Sunfire when he left the team, were the first picks to be on the team because of their class 5 (Omega level) mutations.
-The guy in the lizard costume is actually suppossed to be able to turn into a lizard at will.

The villian isn't called by name:
-The villians name is ""The Silver Samurai""
  -The Silver Samurai is BH6s top foe in the comic books, although the face behind the mask is changed in the movie.

I'm glad that Bh6 was not produced by Marvel, knowing their history of movie production, and utter failures, they would've butchered the story up.
I'm glad Disney gave BH6 to Pixar for movie production, although this takes BH6 out of the MCU.",1428969600,,1231,4.645161290322581

The humans are good, each with their own unique ability - you don't just have 5 kids that all act the same, they each have a personality and their abilities correspond.

As you would expect from an animated Disney movie, the voice acting is impeccable. You are drawn into the story, and you are cheering as they go on their adventure. The big reveal (no spoilers!) is not life-shattering, and brings the story to a satisfying conclusion.

Of course the story is left open for a sequel.

If you have seen any of the comic this is ""based on,"" and I'm using the quotes on purpose, you will find few similarities. The character names match, and the abilities are close, but this is a kid-friendly story. The comics are more gritty, and more violent. I don't see Disney re-releasing the comics, as it would conflict with the IP they have created in the movie.",1428883200,,1061,4.481865284974093

I felt graphically that the animation was smooth and vivid--however, I felt the textures left much to be desired.  While the colors were incredible and the movie definitely popped on my F8500 plasma, I didn't see the detail that I see in Dreamworks Animation Movies--most recently ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"".  Perhaps it is the style-(since a lot of Disney's recent animations seem smooth as silk)-but I prefer a little more detail.

The soundtrack is incredible for this movie--however taking 7.1 and putting it into Stereo (I currently run two channels) provided some moments when you had to crank the sound to really get a good volume of the vocals--only to be blown away once the action started.

6718103,4,B00O4ZC57I,"I was really really surprised by how well done this movie is!  All the previews looked rather dull and boring, but the movie itself was engaging and clever.  It is an original concept with some funny moments and I wouldn't mind my kids watching it again.  There are some more adult scenes that I wish weren't in the movie.  Higher order concepts that little kids just don't understand and then you have to explain to them what is happening in the movie.  Keep in mind, in the typical Disney fashion, there is death in the movie. Sigh.  It would have been nice to have a children's movie that doesn't involve a loved family member dying, but apparently Disney is incapable of deviating from that script.  I would suggest this movie for children ages 8 and up if you don't want to have to explain certain parts.  My 5 year old daughter didn't really like it and left the room about half way through.  My seven and eight year old sons both liked it.  My husband and I enjoyed it.",1428710400,,976,4.402234636871508

6718215,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This movie was rated PG in theaters, but there are some things in it that may be upsetting to young children. It's really aimed at tweens and young teens. It takes place in fictional, futuristic ""San Fransokyo"". The protagonist, Hiro, is a 13-year-old boy genius who invents robots and goes around to illegal ""robot fights"" (like dog fights, but with robots) fleecing the more experienced gamblers who think he's just a kid with a toy. Cue scary people and chase scenes. His older brother Tadashi, whom he idolizes, convinces him to try to get into the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. At a show there, a fire breaks out. He and his brother escape, but Tadashi goes back in to rescue others, the building collapses, and he dies. So yeah. Not for little kids, and not for anyone who might be upset by these events.

Hiro finds a robot named Baymax that Tadashi left behind. Making a long story short, Baymax gets lost when his battery gets low; in finding him, Hiro uncovers a mystery; Hiro and some friends from SIT try to solve the mystery and get tangled up with a very scary character who turns out to be--well, I won't spoil it for you, but you'll be surprised. Hiro turns Baymax into a mighty flying fighting machine, and invents some equipment for his friends that gives them all special super-human abilities. SPOILER ALERT: Baymax sacrifices himself for the sake of Hiro and his friends, but manages to leave his program cards behind, so Hiro can make a new Baymax. The parting scene is hard to take, and again, younger kids might find it upsetting. Anyway, Hiro and his friends overcome evil (no surprise), and the ending leaves room for a sequel.",1428537600,,1662,4.67235494880546

After he lost someone so close to him in a major tragedy, he befriends a cuddly robot that helps him through this trying time... sometimes not the way the young boy expects. This movie is very cleverly done with showing how to handle death. It has some hidden Public Service Announcements that are cleverly put into the dialogue without being cliche.

This movie might be great for an 8 year old or older. I'm not an overly protective mom but I don't think this is the typical Disney/Pixar family movie. Cute concept & Baymax is great but the movie overall is very sad & the villain is just too much.,1428364800,,390,4.012820512820513

Only downside to this movie is that in typical Disney fashion tragedy has to strike Hiro before he can reach his potential for greatness. That kind of stuff can be hard to explain to little ones. But the action sequences, bright animation, and excellent soundtrack (whoever decided to use ""Immortals"" as the theme song for this movie is brilliant) more than make up for that downer.",1428364800,,547,4.5353535353535355

I watched part of Big Hero 6 with my 6-year-old granddaughter, then came home to re-watch the whole movie. I thought the story began as a fun, creative adventure, but deteriorated into a confusing story, with an irrational plot line. The director of the Institute of Technology in the story, transforms from being portrayed as supportive and mentoring, to becoming destructive and evil. Other reviewers commented on the awkward/confusing, and unecessary blending of the setting, from San Francisco, or Tokoyo, to ""San Fransokyo"" All in all, my impression was that the movie was intended to appeal to attention-disordered, hyped children, who spend too many hours absorbed with electronic games. Other reviewers also commented on this movie's relation to the Marvel franchise, which leaves this granny saying, ""WHAT?""",1428278400,,908,5.3125

I've always been a superhero fan. Comics, movies, games, you name it. I was expecting a fun although somewhat kid oriented movie about superheroes.
This is an unbelievable movie. I'm 42 this year. I found myself tearing up, laughing, and feeling the main character's emotions throughout the entire film. There are several times where the complete suspension of disbelief are absolute. There are few animated films that can suck in adults like this one does and wow does it ever.
I watched this by myself at 1:00 am thinking I'd start it and finish it the next day. I think I'll watch it with the wife tomorrow, probably again by myself, and add it to my collection.
Hands down, this needs to be commended for actually addressing major aspects of a child's (or anyone's) life. Loss, death, emotional trauma, dealing with hardships such as those... and absolutely fantastic encouragement of being smart and thinking outside the box as positive ideals.
I hope to see more movies along these lines as time goes on.",1428192000,,1055,4.802197802197802

6718517,5,B00O4ZC57I,"My son (age 8) asked me to write a review for what has quickly become his favorite movie. I said I would because, to be honest, it is becoming MY favorite movie. As animated movies go, I was pretty big on The Incredibles and WALL-E. I think BH6 combines everything that was great about those 2 films and goes even further. I'm not a comic book guy although I really appreciate the genre and will read them from time to time. To be honest I didn't even know BH6 was originally a comic. So I can't really speak to how close to the text the movie is. All I can talk about is how much fun it is to watch BH6, particularly when you watch it with your kids. My daughter (age 5) also loves it and took it upon herself to mimic the Beymax fist bump ""Balelela"" thing (when you see it you'll know). She'll do it 3 or 4 times during the movie. Melts my heart.

Anyhow, the movie is a spectacular event. The scenery and action are unparalleled and every character is unique and capable of having their own spin-off movie or TV show. Having a daughter I was particularly happy with the strong female characters who send the message that it is cool to be a strong girl and still be a nerd. The plot is fairly intricate for an animated movie and the pace keeps you locked into every scene. I didn't want the film to end (although the animated short ""Feast"" that follows the streaming version is well worth the wait). I don't want to give anything away so I will just say SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not be disappointed.",1428105600,,1501,4.229965156794425

I really do wish they'd stop traumatizing the main characters by killing off their family.

We need more of these type movies. I appreciate that Disney has been putting forth an effort to create diverse heroes as well. My grandaughters are completely ""color blind"" when it comes to heroes & heroines.  Before Fraozen, Tiana of The Frog Prince was their favorite princess. We just watched Home and they were enthralled and thoroughly entertained by that movie and its heroine and her alien companion, as well.",1428019200,,583,4.762376237623762

That and you'll notice the city is entirely empty at any point where danger has been presented. I don't know if this is explained in the comics but I find it interesting that a city named after two of the most populous cities in the world has like...7 people in it.

You'll like it. It's paced well and makes you feel good. They skip a LOT of tropes, minus one, that trop they keep raises a lot of creepy existential questions near the end.",1427932800,,612,4.368421052631579

My granddaughter will come crawl in bed with me in the evenings and ask if we can watch it. Who am I to say ""no""? Plus, the movie teaches a wonderful lesson About life, not causing harm and has also helped my (not quite 4 year old) granddaughter to understand death, heaven and where her Papaw has gone.

Baymax starts off as just a simple technological achievement and ends up being the most ""human"", the most ""sentient"" of any character you have ever encountered! Your emotions run the gamut, and the film leaves you emotionally drained, yet completely elated, by the end. Few movies have ever shown so beautifully how friendship and love can develop from the most unexpected places! One of the best animated films, ever!",1427587200,,557,5.065217391304348

6718949,5,B00O4ZC57I,"BIG HERO SIX is a slick, sweet and occasionally scary PIXAR adventure (Pixar...Disney...whatever) that upgrades THE IMPOSSIBLES morality modality and coolness into the 21st century's futuristic ""San Franstokyo"". Here, the14-year old Hiro (our young protagonist) must choose between his own maverick genius--and a prestigious scholarship at the most brilliant and geekiest university know to man. Outrageous fortune sends  Hiro and his faithful crew of geeky misfits in search of a murderer. That's all of the plot that you'll hear from me.

If I have tweaked your interest, all the better. Unless you have very young one's at home (or you are a dedicated Disney collector) I think that one viewing is all that you really need. I say RENT and don't buy this sweet little film. Regardless of how you get this on your HDTV screen, by all means SEE IT.",1427587200,,848,5.00709219858156

This was the first movie that we took our grandchildren to see as we believed they had reached the single digit ages when they would enjoy it.  They are still talking about it.

It's rare to find children's movies with this amount of ethnicities represented, and wonderful to see them as heroes to boot!  The only downer is that there is major loss for the main character, which is perhaps a bit mature for preschoolers.  Overall wonderful film and suggest watching it with your children to discuss some of deeper themes - loss and death, betrayal and attempted murder, evil intentions to harm vs. doing good.",1427500800,,600,4.98

6719107,3,B00O4ZC57I,"This was a cute movie. It was recommended as something a 3-4 year old child would enjoy. It was reasonably appealing in this way. I was hoping for a bit better storyline than I was presented with, though, honestly.

*** SPOILER ALERT***

The premise that the professor, who showed such great care and interest in his students, would so blithely attempt to KILL his former star pupils, for ANY reason, was rather absurd. That someone who had lost his daughter to a tragedy to the point of seeking revenge, and is an educated man such as this professor, would be utterly blind to the similarity and impactful nature of the death he inadvertently caused of his student, the older brother, was similarly absurd. This ""villain"" was not believable in this sense, and it was, honestly, distracting, as soon as it was reasonable to guess he was being made the villain in the story (and it was pretty obvious MUCH earlier than the reveal).

This movie was quite obviously aimed at much younger viewers, but it is unfortunate the writers couldn't do a better job making the story more appealing to older audience members by better closing some of the plot holes and better developing some of these characters to more believably portray their personal choices and abilities.

I'm sure others will say I'm being too judgemental of a movie of this nature, but I've come to expect more from a movie such as this, even if it is intended for a younger audience. Kids aren't stupid. And besides, many movies have proven that it is quite possible to appeal to younger audiences while still capturing the attention and suspension of disbelief for the parents as well.",1427328000,2,1648,4.751748251748252

6719145,3,B00O4ZC57I,"The first scenes drew me in like a thermal blanket on a cold winter night. The dark underbelly of San Fransokyo, where the underlings of the city gather to make quick scratch battling illegal bots under the fading streetlights of the dark side of town. However, for me, the narrative sort of lost it from there. And that was only five minutes in. Granted, I'm an Adult and this movie is not geared for me. Still, it seems the best cartoons speak effectively to both adults and children- (Iron Giant) and my attention started to wander after certain Plot Point markers were hit, that I recognized from other narratives. Evil Genius? check Feisty Asian Girl? check. Predictable plot twist in the first act? Check. Portal to Other Realms? check. Don't get me wrong- the graphics are stunning. There is...some character revelation and IT HAS A MESSAGE. WHAT IS THAT MESSAGE?  THE MESSAGE IS- ""WHEN YOU'RE UPSET, DON'T RUN AWAY FROM YOUR FRIENDS, BECAUSE THEY'RE HERE TO HELP YOU!!! Yeah, okay. But, as someone in Hollywood once said, ""If you want to send a message, use Western Union..""",1427328000,2,1082,4.786096256684492

The animation is first rate as is the amusing transformation of San Francisco into a mix between S.F. and Tokyo, San Frantokyo.  The story does ultimately become a rather overly familiar story of a determined band of plucky protagonists overmatched by an evil and powerful villain.  Destruction and chaos reigns until the good guys win.  A bit too formulaic, but good fun nonetheless.",1427328000,,446,4.906666666666666

I also think that this movie is wonderful I that it appeals to boys and girls. The group has two females, though they are not well developed, and the movie celebrates STEM.  It should be noted that it employs the usual Disney/Pixar plot device of killing family members.  My son was questioning the deTh and commenting why the main character was sad.

6719456,3,B00O4ZC57I,"I found this movie to be to be fairly inline with other good offerings from Disney Animation Studios.

The characters are fairly typical for kids' movies, bordering on derivative. You have the rebellious young hero with a sassy attitude, an innocent, naive Wall-E like robot, a few stereotypical nerd and stoner characters and some others that fade into the background.

There's lots of silliness, fighting and explosions to keep the movie fun, but not much that really made the movie stand out to me.

There is a bit more emotional complexity than average (an important character dies early on, but almost before you grow so attached as to feel too sad), but it lacks the humor and sentimentality of ""Lego Movie"", the experimental artistry of ""The Book of Life"", the dark mystery and beauty of ""BoxTrolls"" or the engaging storyline and tear-jerker quality of ""Song of the Sea"".

Nevertheless, it's a fun ride and a movie kids seem to enjoy. If you liked ""Bolt"" and ""Wreck In Ralph"", you'll enjoy this movie, too!

Oh, and as a small aside, I think it's a bummer that Disney isn't offering the 3D version of this movie in the United States. You have to order from the UK if you want the added fun of 3D.",1427068800,,1203,4.629107981220657

The one plot issue I had with this at the end was.....  um, did anyone think that backing up Baymax's program was something worth doing?  Considering that Hiro had these drives already and could write to it, did it ever occur to anyone to have a backup so you could make another Baymax should something happen?

And #2, you're in an interdimensional portal and yet have no problems breathing?

And #3, there's something at the end after the credits that has to do with that painting...... :)

Animation fans lucked into a treasure trove of films in 2014, with Disneys Big Hero 6 at the top with an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. That it won over entries like How to Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (not to mention The Lego Movie, which wasn't nominated but should have been), is saying something. Yes, some themes and plot devices are familiar, but the end result is a beaut.
Its got a bouncy soundtrack composed by Henry Jackman (Kick-Ass, The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but Big Hero 6 is no musical. You can let go of Let It Go. Jackmans work is perfect for this fast-moving, heart-of-gold adventure, and its great effects and sparkling dialogue  all delivered on an outstanding DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix.
The Blu-ray picture is equally fantastic, with vivid color and near 3-D detail. Detail, depth and contrast is so good, visuals look tangible. Sometimes enough to pull you out of the story. It CANT be real  but it LOOKS real. Real enough to touch.
And the story is golden. In the time honored fashion of many origin stories, a group of talented youths become costumed superheroes to avenge one of their own. Sounds clich, right? Except Big Hero 6, scripted by Jordan Roberts, Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird from a Marvel comic by Duncan Rouleau and Steven T. Seagle, plays to the heart. Directors are Don Hall and Chris Williams. Collectively, this group has worked on The Emperors New Groove, Monsters, Inc., Monsters University, Cars, and March of the Penguins.
We meet orphaned brothers Tadashi and Hiro Hamada, young engineering virtuosos. Hiro, 14, is a prodigy; hes already graduated from high school, but has nothing but trouble in his future. Big brother Tadashi, who attends the local university, introduces him to the world of science nerd-dom  and his creation, Baymax, a healthcare robot that looks like a giant marshmallow. Inspired to apply to the school through the annual science fair, Hiro creates an amazing project of his own  microbots that swarm into towering, moving structures. Everythings going great until a fire breaks out and Tadashi is killed.
That we learn to care for the brothers and experience Hiros loss is what sets Big Hero 6 apart from others of its kind. The story never shys from Hiros grief; we work through his loss with him. Still, the driving force is the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, the most lovable robot since WALL-E. The comedy and warmth is as strong as we found in Up, which also dabbled in high-tech. Baymax doesnt just come out of the box as a fully functioning caregiver. He is a robot; he is programmed  and he has lots to learn about human nature. Meanwhile, young Hiro has a lot to learn about growing up. These two are meant for each other.
And they are joined by a bright assembly of friends and family that help them on their quest.
Big Hero 6 is packaged in a Blu-ray/DVD combo, where all extras are found on the Blu-ray. First up is a terrific animated short, Feast, about a puppy named Winston. Created by Patrick Osborne (Bolt, Tangled), there is no dialogue, only action, and it is  WOW  so good.
The Origin of Big Hero 6: Hiros Journey is a making-of that takes us from the comic to the movie. Disney staff shows us the process of story building and design choices. Baymaxs face was inspired by the bells of a Zen temple; his walk by the most adorable creature on two feet: A toddler. Originally set in Tokyo, the story was moved to a near-future city of tech and art, San Fransokyo. Check out the detail on the Painted Lady Victorians of a revamped Telegraph Hill; the giant, kite-like flying turbines, where Hiro and Baymax pause to rest after their first flight together; the pagoda architecture of the old Golden Gate, now the new San Franskoyo Bridge, and the Lucky Cat Caf, home to the Hamada brothers, Mochi the cat, and their Aunt Cass, who cares for them.
Big Animator 6: The Characters Behind the Characters is a roundtable discussion between the talents who worked on the film. Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Directors Don Hall & Chris Williams are four extra scenes that feature two different openings. They are shown in animated-sketch format and demonstrate how writers choose one sequence over another for better story-telling impact.
Its a film with extras that will stand up for many repeat viewings. Be sure to watch through the credits, though, for an end-piece that will bring a smile to any comics fan.   Kay Reynolds",1426896000,,4564,4.7440100882723835

However, I have learned that they have already seen the movie.  Having watched it myself, I am a little concerned with the violence that I detected, and have some misgivings about the person who turns out to be something of a hero figure in the movie being portrayed as not wanting to get an education.  These misgivings not withstanding the story line of the movie is commendable and there are a number of features of the movie which present a good message.",1426809600,,596,4.5

An excellent addition to you Disney collection, and also might be a thoughtful, helpful gift to someone recently suffering the loss of a loved one. I would especially recommend this beautifully computer animated feature to anyone who is a fan of super hero movies, robots, or The Iron Giant, although if you have very young children with no grasp of the concept of mortality  it may be a bit over their heads and confusing or slightly upsetting, though not graphic at all.",1426809600,,633,4.504347826086956

6719652,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I had low expectations for this movie.  The trailer was uninspired and uninspiring and the title confused me.  I thought ""Big Hero 6"" was some strange Americanized Japanese name for the big white blob who was supposed to be the ""hero"" of the movie.  But I started watching it (a rented DVD for now) and was quickly sucked into the world of San Fransokyo and its denizens.  The characters are charming and wonderfully voiced, the CGI richly detailed, and many shots were obviously constructed specifically for 3D.  Even without seeing it in 3D the 'scapes were gorgeously rendered for something that is basically meant to be a cartoon, with rich depth and dimension.  It's a movie that you can watch more than once and still chuckle at the humor and find new details you previously missed, especially the wonderful flourishes in the behaviors of the characters that make them come to life as real people.  It was a little bit predictable for those of us who have been around long enough and seen enough movies to anticipate twists, but that did not spoil the movie because they put thought into the backgrounds and motives of the characters. (Watching it a second time, you pick up the clues you may not have noticed the first time.)  Even the big white blob made sense once Baymax (the big marshmallow-looking thing) was introduced and explained.  It was an ""Oh!  Okay, I get it now"" moment for me.  It is a story of loss and the desire for revenge, and the loss and reclamation of innocence.  It balanced action with heart and humor and I was thoroughly and unexpectedly charmed.  However, I will wait for it to come out in 3D before I hand over my money because I don't want to fall into the trap of buying a movie and then want to pull out my hair in frustration when the 3D version is released later.  Been there, done that, got tired of doing it.  I do wish they had made a better trailer for this movie because I'm certain many people, like me, thought the movie looked silly and stupid when judged by the trailer alone.  Sometimes it's nice to be wrong.  If you have any ounce of nerd in you, I think you'll find this movie a pleasant surprise.",1426809600,,2151,4.502577319587629

Cons:  None for the movie.  Amazon didn't bill for it until it actually shipped.  I'd pre-ordered the month before so I was startled when my CC showed the charge (I had forgotten about it).  I received it about 4 days after the release date due to shipping, though the wait was worth it for the savings (collector's edition for $19 instead of $28 - $32 at whatever-mart)

Thoughts:  First time I'd pre-ordered on Amazon, I'll do it again.  Fun movie.  We saw it in the theater and it was awesome.  At home was almost better.  Smaller screen, but cheap snacks/soda.  :D",1426723200,,775,4.588235294117647

It's not just by chance that they were amazing but because they actually use their brain.  The creators of this movie made such an excellent creative story outline, that it not only made it very engaging and exciting, but also very funny.  My 9 children love to watch this movie over and over again and it captures the attention of adults to little ones.  It's story line isn't extrmely scary like most super hero movies that give my little ones nightmares so I appreciate that very much.  It is so hard to find a movie that can do all the things these producers have.  I hope they create many, many more movies just like this.  It is truly the best movie I've watched in years.

Fortunately, he stuck with Big Hero 6 and it is now his favorite movie.  It's got everything a child can ask for in a superhero movie.  Cool male AND female heros.  A display of science that will captivate your child's imagination.  A robot who is a friend and protector.  And a team of people who work together to overcome the bad guy.

I didn't think I would like the robot character when I first heard about it, but it didn't take long for my heart to melt.

This Movie itself fits the bare minimum requirements of what a entertaining animation should be. The quality of animation and the Lighting of the world is top notch.
To me, a animated movie comes down to the story. And after Frozen, Up, Nemo, Incredibles etc. expectations are high. The story for this one is okay, very predictable and borderline boring. A kid would probably enjoy it. Scratch that, my 4 year old niece actually walked away from it. Now, this is a kid who is always glued to the screen, and she walked away from it.
The main robot character is cute. But for me, it's charm wore off less than half way into the film. The Film is full of Hollywood cliches.
Anyway, it fits all requirements to be a bare minimum enjoyable animated film, but nowhere close to the greats.",1426550400,,924,4.409356725146199

6720149,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Outside of just being another wonderful animated film from Pixar/Disney/Dreamworks/etc, Big Hero 6 has at its center a profound emotional literacy and moral maturity, one with depth that eclipses most of the CGI genre: No matter how exciting the action becomes or funny the comedy, Baymax, the puffy robot at the center of the story, has the primary purpose of caring for another during a time of personal loss, and unabashedly suggests the presence of loved ones and friends, physical contact and verbal reassurance, and stating or confirming the names of the feelings one feels. Big Hero 6 is a movie about the right and wrong ways to deal with death, and executes that premise successfully enough, I imagine, to be shown by healthcare professionals to young people who lose someone close to them.

6720190,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Spoilers ahead, so beware...

While this was a fun movie with a lot of funny moments, what tickled me most was that it (most likely unintentionally) hit on a particular truth that is almost never spoken of, and that is that Universities are just as greedy and exploitative as big corporations, if not more so.
I believe it was unintentional because it starts with the usually idea that everyone should be going to college, that Hiro was wasting his time by not going to college, etc. etc. (and I believe a number of universities were consulted on this project). Yet, Hiro was correct in his observation that college would just tell him things he already knows. He came up with the most cutting edge robotics technology in his garage. The big bad corporate man offered him billions for his invention (and would likely have been willing to hire him, give him his own lab and massive research budget, as well as salary, to continue his work).
The professor also wants the invention. He appeals to Hiro by saying that the corporate guy just wants to exploit the invention, while at the university, Hiro will get to work on it himself (yet, come on, in reality, would corporate man really not want such a brilliant inventor on their payroll as well?). Meanwhile, the university instead gets to exploit the invention, while Hiro gets nothing in return but a degree, so he can then go to work for corporate guy anyway. Of course, then the professor steals the tech for himself, kills the brother, and tries to kill his other students as well. At least corporate guy was honest in his desire.",1426464000,,1584,4.6571428571428575

The one thing he and I noticed without knowing anything and about who the creators were beforehand was that it had similarities to my son's favorite show, Ben 10. When the credits came on and we saw the name of the creator there, we both became even more excited. We will be buying this movie instead of renting it on Prime next time because of this. :)",1426377600,,507,4.183673469387755

Marvel meets Jules Verne:
Anyone who has ever visited a makerspace would enjoy the world that the writers developed.  I really like that this fantasy had more akin to a modern day Jules Vernes industrial punk than to the typical super hero powers found in Marvel comics that this movie is apparently loosely based.  While some of the technology is certainly fantastical, it was grounded in common day materials (servos, 3D printers etc.)
The writers did a good job (not great) of navigating and even turning the tables on the capitalism is evil theme that is prevalent in some anime.

The cons:
The writing didn't have enough for the adult crowd, but I think that this movie is still fun for all ages.",1426204800,,716,4.658730158730159

Professor Callahan wanted to get revenge on Doctor Cray whose experiment had killed Callaha's daughter. The plot is smartly built, ripple after ripple.

Was expecting state of the art computer animation but instead find this feature done on the cheap in some ways. This does not share the same exhausting attention to detail like, say, Tangled.

Hero has less lighting and shading critiquing. The hairs on the heads of characters have more blocks than individual strands.

Overall a fraction of what the latest software and techniques are capable of. Lazy, in my opinion.

How to Train Your Dragon 2 really set a new benchmark.

I liked the message about the importance of school and creativity, but as usual Hollywood movies spend little time emphasizing the work and study part is needed to create something. It is always think hard for 5 minutes and execute your great idea. Kind of a bad message for younger kids.",1426032000,,445,4.792207792207792

6720500,3,B00O4ZC57I,"For some reason I actually enjoyed FEAST better than the main feature. BH6 is great to look at, and has some exciting ideas, but the humor seems to be targeted towards juveniles, and for a lot of people, that is what cartoon animation is for. But Disney cultivated a unique outlook of family entertainment that was geared for everyone in the audience, not just children, and vica versa. It seems the Disney Studios are targeting young people and dragging their adult contemporaries along because the humor here doesn't affect me. In fact, I find very little to laugh at unless you like to laugh at nerdish outcasts and their funky ways.
""Ba-la-la-la-la"" doesn't strike me as much of a punchline in any joke inside or out. Only kids would probably like something like that because it's something they could probably share amongst themselves. I also find it hard to believe a 14 year old would have all that accumulated futuristic hardware in his garage at his beckoning call, enough to construct a team of Iron Mans.
So there you go. Ba-la-la-la-la. Now I get it.",1426032000,,1062,4.745945945945946

6720766,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Ahhhh, Big Hero 6. Easily in my Top 3 Favorite Movies of 2014. What a technological masterpiece!!! The animation, characters, and production design in this film is crazy, just crazy. I love just about everything about this film, and I couldn't wait to own it. Since a lot of reviewers review the actual movie, I'll review the product, the ""Collector's Edition Blu-ray Combo Pack"". First off, I love that Disney chose to include the blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy, and not make us decide if we want either blu-ray OR dvd like they did with the Marvel combo packs of recent (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc.). I love having the option of playing it on any device I'd like, and letting friends borrow the dvd if they ask. I also love that Disney has launched their Disney Movies Anywhere app, which now lets buyers watch their digital copies on any smartphone, computer, tablet, or smart tv/blu-ray player. It also links with your VUDU account, which is great if the device you wish to watch on doesn't have Disney Movies Anywhere. Great job for expanding your marketing demographics, Disney! Smart move! And as an Android user, I'm glad I can watch my Disney flicks on my devices now. Okay, I digress. Now, let's get to the real reason us movie collectors buy these packs, and that's the Special Features:
DVD: The DVD includes the theatrical short, ""Feast"", which won the Oscar for Best Animated Short this year. (And rightfully so.) It also comes with the Big Hero 6 theatrical teaser, which was the 01:40 long trailer that released before the film's premiere. It's essentially a condensed version of when Hiro develops the armor for Baymax and how he goes from cuddly and cute, to awesome and superhero-ish. There is also a 06:30 long featurette called, ""Big Animator 6: The Characters Behind The Characters"". This is a roundtable-style meeting of artists and supervisors talking about how they developed the characters for the film. Nothing too in-depth here, but it's a fun little segment to watch.
BLU-RAY: The blu-ray includes everything that the DVD does, but also has in my opinion, the best special feature in this pack. ""The Origin Story Of Big Hero 6: Hiro's Journey"" is a fifteen minute-long featurette detailing how the film's characters and idea originally came from the Marvel comic of the same name, and how it blossomed into something both original and heartwarming. This extra gives all sorts of insight into the making of the film, and is hosted by Jamie Cheung (voice of Go Go). This is a must-watch for everyone who loves this film or just animation in general. The blu-ray also includes deleted scenes which were okay, but I always wish for more in this category.
In summary, The Big Hero 6 Collector's Edition Blu-ray Combo Pack is a great buy for Disney fans, Marvel fans, animation buffs, and cinephiles alike. It doesn't have a ton of special features, which is unfortunate, but the film itself makes up for that deficiency.",1425945600,,2983,4.828125

I wish I had this movie when I was a kid because growing up there weren't many role models for me as an isolated Asian kid. What's especially great about the main group of characters is they are an intellectual, nerdy group and they are portrayed in a way that makes them appear to be so ridiculously cool. There are so many great lessons to be learned from the film that are taught by truly endearing and entertaining characters.

The visual and verbal humor is top notch, dry and subtle mixed in with in-ur-face.  There is plenty of kid's and adult humor to entertain everyone.  The scene shown in the trailer with scotch tape is just a hint of what's in store.  Great well-developed characters, charming plot and interaction, I am captivated by Baymax.  I want one of my own.

This is a great movie for both younger and older kids as well as adults too.  I liked that the storyline was a bit more complex than some of the other Disney movies.

6720896,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This movie is a little weird as it is set in a town that is a merging of San Francisco and Tokyo. That's a little scary as it seems to be a foreshadow of what's to come in America. But I won't go into politics here. This is a Disney movie, for entertainment purposes only. right?

This is much like traditional Anime that is usually non-Japanese looking people with Japanese names. It just feels odd because I am not used to 3 D anime from Disney.

Baymax, whose name sounds almost like Beta Max is charmingly voiced by Scott Adsit who sounds a lot like Robert England in his ""V"" days. The lead character is a teen named Hero. But you have to pronounce it with a Japanese accent as in Hiro, as the name is actually a Japanese name, and not a description of a person endowed with great courage and strength. What a clever use of the double meaning. You can be a hero in America, and named Hero (Hiro) in Japan.

The story falls a little short as Disney once again tries to play bait and switch with the villains. It didn't work in Frozen and it doesn't work here. Still, there is poetry in motion as the villain goes through his moves. I loved to watch him as much as I loved to watch Baymax.

The movie seems to be a prequel as it is about the birth of some new ""Teen Titan"" type kids. I'm not necessarily looking forward to that. I think this movie stands on its own.

I highly recommend it. it's lots of fun.",1425945600,,1410,4.169117647058823

The bonus features are worth watching if you can figure out how to turn off the Amazon movie suggestions that pop up at the tail part of the credits just as the movie would normally end, but stay in place blocking the bottom of the screen during the special features which follow the movie.  Perhaps that is something they only do to Roku viewers, but I wish I knew how to turn it off (anyone know?)  In any case, it's a good movie.  4 stars for the movie itself, the 5th for being something kids and parents can enjoy together.",1425945600,,661,4.214285714285714

Nice change of pace from most of the dark origin stories although there is a significant death at the beginning.

And of course ""FROZEN' which also was NOT in 3d here.  That makes FOUR movies in a row where they robbed us of a 3d release.

He just loves it.  It is fun, and, as you expect from Disney, very family friendly.  Now, as you should also expect from Disney by now, the family dies.  The family always dies.  I think there is no such thing as a Disney main character who has a happy, loving family.  The family always gets killed off.  If you have a younger child, get ready for that.  And the villain is pretty sinister.  This is a little more futuristic and a little darker than your typical Disney story. This is definitely not Frozen.  There is zero girliness.  NONE. No happy songs. No ""let it go"" moments.  This is a boy movie. The closest thing you will get to girliness is that Bay Max is cuddly.  That is it.  You have superheroes that are definitely not super. You have a villain that has a very complex story. People die. Sacrifices have to be made.  This is not a feel good film.  That being said, for an older child, it is just great.  My son is 12 and he loves it. It is just not for the 4 year olds. Bay Max is cute, but this is not a cutsie Disney movie.  There were some little ones crying when we say it in the theater.  Fortunately, there are none at my house.",1425859200,,1317,4.1673306772908365

6721403,3,B00O4ZC57I,"Good but with some, for me, really bad storytelling elements. And remember this is just my opinion.  I don't have kids, so I""m only basing it off of my own feelings and love of animated films. The movie has great animation and some wonderful fun or kind/caring moments, but it is also full of predictable and very tiring stereotypes (sad but not unexpected), which are also copies of other more famous films as well (again not unexpected but again, with something like this, you would think Disney would go the extra mile and try to break out of such copying).

But my main criticism and sadness regarding the film is that it has one glaringly false moment, where a character seems totally out of sync with that character's pre-established character...so acting completely un-empathetic to Hiro's brother's death made no real sense, and only seemed to serve as a way for Hiro to get angry and do something violent...and the motivation behind this supposed jeckel/hyde like behavior also made no sense.  Frankly, it seemed like very bad writing, and it could have been done another way with much the same effects but without the jarring moment that was just too forced and too strange.

Add the obvious red herring that was done simply to be a red herring.  In fact, that the person would have/could have been a better villain and one where the audience would have loved to see being 'beaten' by the good guys.  It would have been predictable, yes, but actually, a lot more believable and satisfying than what the writers did instead.  The writers could even had started with the one villain, but had him be apologetic and guilt ridden (not callous) and then had the red herring turn into the real villain.  That would have been workable, too, and more believable and satisfying.

Instead, they go for something that to me, at least, felt very jarring and dissatisfying and didn't do justice to the multi-millions and millions of man/woman hours that went into making this otherwise spectacular looking animation.  Very disappointing and instead of this movie being one that I want to hang on to and watch over and over again, it made it something I won't bother watching again.

Perhaps that's also why Disney management is putting it on sale everywhere. I bought my copy at FredMeyer for a lot below 'suggested retail' (which is very odd for a new Disney film).  Perhaps some at Disney feel also that the storytelling here has some faults and want to sell as much as possible before people move on to the next 'looks good in marketing' film.

So just as this one is likely to make a lot of money even with its faults, one like Disney Planes: Fire and Rescue, which is so much better than the first Planes entry (in my opinion) and also suffers from the usual stereotypes (but so many do), probably won't get the respect and sales it deserves sadly, but at least in my home, I'll be watching Fire and Rescue multiple times.",1425772800,3,2923,4.685546875

6721408,4,B00O4ZC57I,"In Big Hero 6, Hiro develops a bond with his plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax and team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes.

With this movie, I expected some light comic super hero action but I was totally surprised as this movie really hits on some heavy subjects considering it is a cartoon.  Touching on things such death, loss, revenge and healing and real life type issues.  I didn't expect it for sure but this movie handles the subjects pretty well and has a pretty good message too.

The animation is great, I commented partially through the movie at how amazing animation is in the movie.  The movie has a story that not only kids will enjoy but the adults did as well.  With a good pace that will make you laugh at times but at the same time dealing with the heavy subjects throughout the movie with style.  Not that it is a huge deal in a cartoon but the story is a bit predictable and formulaic and tends to borrow from other movies throughout but even with that I enjoyed watching it.

I appreciate that the violence was more implied and kept to minimum but be aware that there are still some intense moments. Worth viewing and discussing with your child especially the younger ones. I truly appreciate the non-violence message tied in and how the robot had a much greater mission than revenge. I have not been a Disney fan due to all the frequent sexist themes, but this was refreshing. Well done Disney.",1425600000,,589,4.566037735849057

I have purchased other Disney titles such as frozen and tinkerbell and the never land Pirates and both were compatible with the kindle.  Given my previous success I didn't even consider that this title would not be compatible. Disney advertises that the movie is available ""anywhere"" and ""everywhere"",but clearly that is not the case.  It is only supported by iTunes, google play, and vudu. Neither of these android apps are compatible or available on the kindle fire. False advertising Disney!",1425513600,,574,5.161290322580645

6721587,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Kudos to Disney for another movie with a great storyline that does NOT include another princess saved by a guy!  This movie is full of emotions and real-life references that are relative in today's world.  If you don't FEEL the emotion in this movie then I'd have to question if you have a heart at all.

This is not a mushy, boy meets girl love story and I like that.  Disney (and most any production company these days) puts out enough of those.  This is a movie that all ages and both boys and girls will enjoy.",1425513600,,514,4.257731958762887

So in my opinion we should be fair to those that have them reasonably priced. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one in the store someone said $25. How much do you think they are after taxes. So for someone to say rip off just because they didn't get one is wrong.

Granted the stories are very different but this movie gave me just a warm feeling like I just wanted it to keep going. It did end too soon in my opinion. Baymax's silly dialogue will have you chuckling throughout the whole thing. The characters are very colorful(Figuratively and literally). Just a fun movie!,1425513600,,481,4.4772727272727275

As an adult I enjoyed more than I expected but if I had to say something not so great about the movie I would say that it was a ltitle overly emotional but that doesn't take away from this sweet and fun movie.,1425427200,,404,4.259740259740259

6722207,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Great movie, but it definitely deserves it's PG rating. Do not simply sit young children in front of this and walk away. It deals with very personal loss and the effects it can have on people. The effect in this movie is the characters are willing to kill for vengeance. Not the sort of thing you want your children watching alone. I was shocked by the idea that these formerly decent members of society could be driven to level of rage that happens in this movie. I suppose it's a good topic of discussion in how we deal with loss when we feel someone was responsible for that loss. As with all these types of movies, everything works out in the end. Accept for the bad guy. He really blew it. Lots of great lines, voice acting, animation, and sight gags. Still confused on why San Francisco was sold to the Japanese, however. That part is not explained. Lol.",1425427200,,860,4.415094339622642

The writers did a wonderful job weaving this story.  My kids have asked to watch it several times since we purchased it three days ago.  After the first time they had seen it, I heard them upstairs role-playing the characters.  They have talked about the movie at every meal since we saw it.

And ""Ba-da-la-la-la"" has pretty much become rampant in our home.

6722384,4,B00O4ZC57I,"The trouble with reviewing a film as hyped and popular as Big Hero 6 is that there isn't much about the piece that hasn't been already said.  I suppose the place for me to start would be to confess that Ive been a little leery of the Disney acquisition machine.  If theres one thing the business world teaches us its that monopolies are dangerous.  Disney has been on a tear in the entertainment industry of late, scooping up entire powerhouse studios like Marvel and LucasFilms.  And while its true that they have pockets deep enough to do the properties they are inheriting justice, some of their sensibilities and practices are worthy of skepticism to be sure.

That said Big Hero 6 alleviates any such concerns quite convincingly and in fact can be viewed as one of the finer outings of either of the two companies of late.

Based on a lesser-known Marvel Comics title with strong anime ties and set in the fictional but scarily detailed city of San Fransokyo, we follow the exploits of young robotics wizard Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) and his big brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). After a series of events, Hiro ends up inheriting is older brothers masterwork; an innocent inflatable vinyl nurse robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit) as well as his brothers student colleagues from a prestigious robotics institute.

From there the plot takes a decidedly simplistic narrative turn in the great tradition of Scooby-Doo whereby a masked villain appears with evil intent that only the likes of a group of teenagers and their dog, er I mean vinyl nurse robot can foil.  However, while this would ordinarily sound like a slam, the fact of the matter is rich character development, beautifully placed (and timed humor) and one of the richest environments in the CG medium to date can make the fairly straight-forward plot motivations forgivable.

Even still there are a few pretty nice twists to keep viewers guessing and while the actual hero group itself doesnt quite evolve past the introductory phase, the core of this one hinges on the sincere relationship between Hiro and Baymax.  And what a relationship it is.  On the surface it is one of learning, growing together and the alternating roles of caretaker and receiver but dig a little deeper and there are themes of robotic ethics, the dangers of artificial intelligence and love that can transcend the definition of what we can consider an inanimate object.

Comparisons abound between this one and Pixars much ballyhooed The Incredibles but I tend to fall into the line of reasoning that these are two very different approaches to CG animated super-heroism film (much in the same way you could throw DreamWorks Megamind or Universals Despicable Me into the class).  This is a geek-laden robotics film with a slant toward the value of friendship first and foremost where the group superhero dynamic slowly manifests by the end.  The Incredibles, to my way of reasoning, was more like a superhero commentary film from start to finish.  It took a lot of the cliches and tropes of the genre and used them to create humor against the family dynamic.

At the end of the day though all that really matters is that its very difficult, if not impossible, to come away from the 108-minute visual feast that is Big Hero 6 without some manner of appreciation for the genre as a whole.  When viewed on its technical merit alone, the piece absolutely dazzles from the opening frame to the last shot (which takes place after the closing credits by the way).  Just a decade ago Pixar went on record as stating they shied away from trying to animate humans because there was far too much that could take away from the believability.  Yet here we have a piece that absolutely banks on the believability of its human characters expressions, mannerisms and interactions.  Not only that but it succeeds on a level so subliminally as to earn what is perhaps the greatest accolade to a good animated film in my opinion: at times its easy to forget that what you are watching is in fact an animated film.

I suppose my biggest complaint about the piece (and its pretty minor in the grand scheme of things) would have to be that the marketing potential for this thing is off the charts and its pretty difficult to not envision a world packed with BH6 action figures, backpacks, lunch boxes, bed sheets etc. Not to mention the underlying sensation that this film must surely be positioned to serve as the introduction to a franchise/ series.  Aside from these minor distractions, Big Hero 6 is a wonderful experience for viewers of all ages and proof that, unlike in the world of business, a Disney monopoly may not be such a bad thing after all.",1425427200,5,4673,4.771712158808933

6722409,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Different, but as good as Frozen, my wife pronounced it. Four stars, both of our teens said. And even before it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, Big Hero 6 was easily my pick for the top animated film of 2014.

Disney is a confident bunch, and they set Big Hero 6 in the fictional city of San Fransokyo, which combines a geological mapping of San Francisco with the visual and cultural look of Tokyoa hybrid that allows them to do pretty much anything, visually, rather than being locked into an anime style.

Big Hero 6 tells the story of a 14-year-old robotics prodigy named Hiro (Ryan Potter) whos already graduated from high school and hopes to be accepted into the nerdy robotics school his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) attends. He visits the school and meets some of the other students, a quirky group that includes a tough bicycle-loving woman named GoGo (Jamie Chung), the neurotic and overly self-protective Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.), and a fast-talking hyperexuberant chemistry wiz named Honey Lemon (Gnesis Rodrguez).
Its an origin story, really, about how this group of brainy misfits comes together to form a superhero group called Big Hero 6, but its also every bit as much of a relationship story between a boy and robot as a film like The Iron Giant. The plot is set in motion when Hiros project on microrobotics blows away the competition at a big school science fair, and Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) hands Hiro a letter of acceptance after warning him not to sell his idea to billionaire businessman Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk).

Like the best animated Disney films, Big Hero 6 has it all. Well, almost all. Theres no music in this film, but Big Hero 6 makes you laugh, well up, and gasp as only Disney animators can. Its a visually stimulating action film that has emotional content in every sequence. From an opening scene involving botfights to the emergence of a Kabuki mask-wearing villain who commands an army of microbots that shift alignments to form whatever shape hes thinking, the animation is enthralling.

Ill admit that the posters didn't enthrall me, though, nor did they entice my children. Pictured was a white blob of a robot that looked more like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters than anything original. But from the moment that the vinyl Baymax inflates and says to Hiro, Hello, Im Baymax, your Personal Health Care Companion, you're hooked. Baymax, whos programmed to be a caregiver that can scan bodies and identify, then treat whats wrong, moves like a toddler with a full diaper, according to the animators. And yes, his movements are hilarious. When Baymax tries to mimic a fist bump that Hiro always did with his brother, the result is a catch phrase and gesture that puts an exclamation point on a personality thats already hugesomething I never would have believed possible, just from looking at a photo of him.

Disney animators really make us care about the characters and their feelings for each other. And with an inflatable robot whos basically a home nurse, thats some feat. Our family collectively gave it an A.

It has a little moral lesson as well as just great fun.  There are some sad points and some scary(?).  None of the kids (even the 3 year old) was scared during or after the movie.  This being said I think the grand kids are exposed to movies that some their age might not be.",1425340800,,506,3.9504950495049505

It seems to have plenty for kids to love.  I especially like that my daughter now wants to invent new things and go to a university...that is a positive message to give kids.  It does have some Frozen moments, which my daughter loves and watches over and over again to see the statue of Hans blow up....If you blink you will miss it.  Not as complicated as ""Wreck it Ralph"" and I thought not as lovable as ""Frozen"".  But after watching six times with my daughter it is growing on me.  Some of it was too intense for my 4 year old, she does not want to watch it anymore.",1425340800,,719,4.166666666666667

All their movies have to have the same kind of elements.. there is always a tragedy someone and a supposed ""plot twist"". The kid in the movie kind of reminds me of toy man in the batman and superman movie. The kid from japan that's a genius robot maker.

It's full of techno-gizmo stuff (hello, kids and Millennials) and belief in oneself, good vs, evil, loss and grief, happiness and excitement, and on and on.  It must have been a dusty theater when I took the kids or something, because my eyes were watering something fierce.  Same thing happened at home.

Bottom line:  WATCH THIS MOVIE!! Put your phone down, get someone to snuggle with, press the 'Play' button, and enjoy yourself.  You'll thank yourself for it later.",1425340800,,652,4.626086956521739

All 3 of my nephews loved the movie, as well.  Also, had to purchase songs, from the soundtrack, that they couldn't stop singing along to.  It did have a very emotional, sad, plot point, but I've noticed more animated movies doing that, lately.

6722861,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Boy, did Disney pull a fast one!  My wife and I were captivated by the gently humorous trailer that featured the awkward and clumsy robot and the boy who seemed to be his inventor. This seemed to suggest a film centered around the two of them and their adventures. Not so.  Apparently the odd title is explained by the Marvel comic book, which I was not aware of.  The film turns out to be yet another superhero movie with a ""WWII platoon"" assembly of goofy and lovable side-kicks of all genders, races, and personalities. This doesn't make the film bad, just very misleading. One of the deleted scenes is an alternate beginning sequence that is less violent and frenetic than the one the studio chose to go with. The discarded ending dealt with the relationship of the two brothers but didn't feature a (ho-hum) chase.",1425340800,,819,4.63448275862069

Review of Movie:
Inspired by a comic by Marvel of the same name, Big Hero 6 is another great movie from Disney. From the diverse characters to the exceptionally beautiful world that the animators created, it is quite obvious why this film has received many awards including the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. The main character is 14 year old Hiro Hamada who is not unlike any other 14 year old...except that he is a genius in the world of robotics and graduated high school at 13. Big Hero 6 is a great film for all ages. It has a great balance of comedy and seriousness that allows it to portray very heavy topics in an entertaining manner. This film teaches children about loss, friendship, and courage in a way I've never seen before. The characters are diverse and entertaining while at the same time never taking away from the bigger picture. Points given for two great female role models found in Honey Lemon and Go-Go, as well as a racially diverse cast. My only complaint is that none of the female characters talk to each other. However, that still doesn't take away from the countless positive points that this movie promotes.

Brief overview: WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS
Hiro is very close to his brother, Tadashi, as their parents died 10 years ago. Tadashi, fearing that his brother is going to waste his gift, takes Hiro to 'the nerd lab' where he and his friends (Wasabi, Go-Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred) develop the latest in robotic technology in the hopes of inspiring his little brother to do something with his big brain. Tadashi's ruse worked, and shortly after Hiro is given a letter of acceptance to the same college as his brother. Unfortunately, there is an accident in which Tadashi dies, leaving Hiro alone with his aunt. In the aftermath of Tadashi's death, Hiro is trying to cope with the grief but seems completely uninterested in life until he finds Baymax, the robotic project that his brother was working on.

6723250,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Great family movie!

As a comic book fan I have always wanted to share my passion with my kids.  Cartoons are cool and it's even cooler to have Disney bringing all the action out of the pages I've loved for so long to the big screen.  Unlike most of the comic movies that have been getting produced as live action they kept this one animated and made it family friendly.  What better than a team of crime fighters with a giant fluffy robot?  This movie has so much emotion jam packed.  Dealing with loss, sorry, anger, revenge, forgiveness, and recovery.  It keeps you involved the whole way through.  You want to know who the bad guy is and you love seeing the characters grow.  It's one of those feel good movies that allows you to believe that anything is possible i.e; becoming a super hero which I would have to say I am not so compelled.  The main character Hero is admirable and his best friend Baymax a giant fluffy marshmallow looking robot makes you wonder what life might be like in the future when things like him are fabricated.  It's awesome to be able to utilize Amazon to stream video in a world where everything is becoming digital to have your library held with them makes watching easier.  No one wants to have discs taking up the living room any longer and you can watch it from anywhere that has internet access awesome feature.",1425254400,,1349,4.461224489795918

I'm all about teaching kids science, but not in the simplistic, un-creative way this movie does ... the main character Hiro can apparently create incredible inventions almost instantaneously, and without any design or effort -- I get that this is an animated kids movie, but I need to be able to suspend my disbelief (like I did for Shrek, Monsters Inc, or Over the Hedge, The Incredibles), and I just wasn't able to do that with this movie, maybe because the plot was shallow, predictable, character development non-existent, and the big white robot looks like Frost the Snowman -- very un-original?  ....see other reviews for this movie on amazon about that.
The quality of the animation was excellent, but the producers of this movie gave higher importance to animation quality, at the expense of story quality. If you feel compelled to watch this movie, DON''T BUY IT... rent or stream the movie.",1425254400,4,1126,4.715736040609137

Deals with some difficult topics (death of a sibling, revenge, vigilante justice, ethics of science) while not getting to deep to lose children. Kept all the adults in our house entertained.

6723268,2,B00O4ZC57I,"This movie is, uh, robotic. The biggest problems are that it is predictable and its characters are stereotypes. Predictable because it's everything you would expect from a Marvel superhero story, including the military project gone awry. The characters aren't real because they are invincible superheros. Take the 13 year old orphan wunderkind Hiro. To change Baymax into a fighting machine, he simply typed a few keystrokes on his terminals. I've never cared about him one bit, because there is nothing vulnerable about him. And a self-sacrificing robot with a soul? It's been done in 1991 in Terminator 2.

Much was made of Big Hero 6 as a ""Frozen"" for boys. It is not even close from a character-development perspective.",1425168000,3,723,5.07563025210084

6723274,2,B00O4ZC57I,"I was soooo looking forward to this film, but it really let me down.

There are too many things I don't like about this to type them all out, not to mention there would be tons of spoilers. But overall, I thought the story was too simple, and was littered (sort of like trash, actually) with immature tween humor. The jokes were for children (which isn't always a bad thing, I often find children films and stories endearing and fun; one of my favorite movies ever is WALL-E, and I love Pixar films, and How To Train Your Dragon one and two).

There were also a lot of illogical plot points, and bad plot jumps. The animation wasn't even that much better than films from 5 years ago. WALL-E is by far superior in terms of animation (actually superior in every possible way) and it came out in 2008!

Honestly, the 5 star votes for this movie faaaaaar outweigh all other stars combined, so I don't even wanna waste my time typing exactly why I don't like it....my 2 star vote will surely be ignored in the face of the 5 star votes, and probably not even read.

6723435,5,B00O4ZC57I,"It's stuffed with boring Disney tropes, it self-consciously mocks nerdiness while trying to subvert the perception of nerd as non-hero material, it reaches miles beyond its grasp to make a confused statement that boils down to ""it's bad when industrialists get people killed by relaxing standards, but they have good intentions. Scientists pushing the envelope in labs are much worse and capable of killing kids in a revenge scheme to persecute the aforementioned mostly-innocent executives!"" BUT the main characters are much more strongly written than most Disney fare, the robot is possibly the best character of its type ever made, the city and art style are  perfectly and gloriously realized, and the sense of wonder, experimentation and design feels so accessible and a part of this movie's universe that its merits triumph over its many flaws.",1425168000,,850,5.25

6723439,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Disney has officially adopted John Lasseter's approach to writing compelling storylines. Big Hero 6 bridges the gap between vintage Disney and Pixar savvy characters. Robots are the future, it is how we use them will be the real challenge for their success or failure. Big Hero 6 attempts to ask the question, where should we draw the line when inventing and creating new technologies and are we too technologically-dependent and relationally atrophied in our modernity. The story has a basic theme and plot but these subplots or social commentaries are thought-provoking which is in line with any venture that has John Lasseter's name associated with the production. I applaud Disney in not trying to make Pixar into a Disney product but using the elements and creative writing genius that brought us ground-breaking stories like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Up to mature the way Disney creates movies for both young and old audiences around the world. Keep up the great work Disney and congratulations on winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.",1425168000,,1059,5.127167630057803

6723466,4,B00O4ZC57I,"It's no Frozen, but the kids loved it just the same.  John Lasseter (executive producer) has a talent for picking talent.  He scores another hit with Big Hero 6. Kudos to the writing and directing staff.

Just be advised that this movie draws significant influence from the Japanese manga and anime cultural tradition - San Francisco and Tokyo are sort of merged into one wonderfully colorful and engaging city - so it's going to be a little different from previous Disney or Pixar fare. I think that's a good thing, but it might be a little disorienting for someone looking for Smallville, USA.

On a total nerd note, the heroes of Big Hero 6 are heroes because they apply themselves in the sciences and invent their superpowers themselves.  My kids are all girls ranging from less than year to over eleven years, and I look for every opportunity to present STEM materials in a palatable and engaging way.  Big Hero 6 is just one more arrow in my quiver.

I'm grateful to add this to the rotation of kids' movies available at the house.  Two thumbs up!",1425168000,,1053,4.593582887700535

The first thing I did when I got home was order it from Amazon.

I love Disney movies, and often will watch the same ones over and over again, but this one was a once-in-a-while watch.  This mostly stems from the fact that the characters weren't completely accessible to the viewer.  I felt as though something, though slight, was missing.  The story line did do a good job at pulling at my emotions and I teared up a time or two.

6723541,4,B00O4ZC57I,I think it was ok. I was expecting it to be funnier. They pretty much played all the funny parts in the preview. I also wish that it was directed a little more to the smaller kids. There were some parts mentioned that is more appropriate for a teenager or 12 year old I think that could be completely left out.,1425081600,,310,4.098360655737705

6723545,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This movie was great and in my opinion better than frozen and tangled. I liked the whole idea of the robot and how they used him. I have seen bad reviews about a poor plot yet frozen and tangled are the same stuff, all love stories. Finally Disney made something worth watching especially for the male population. Like wreck it ralph the concept of this movie is great. It has tons of humor and can touch the heart at the same time. FYI, If you read the reviews more than half that gave it 1 star complained about not having it in 3D. This is clearly not a 3D movie as it does not say it is, so most of the 1 star reviews are irrelevant. I don't know how anyone can be disappointed in this movie, unless you have no sense of humor or soul.",1425081600,2,739,4.068493150684931

It is a wonderfully done story that treats human loss with tenderness and hope.  The entire story was well done!  I hope we will see a sequel because I will most certainly go to see it when released and no doubt purchase it for my library.  It will be watched over and over again!

My only complaint is it could have used another half hour. Over 2/3rds of the movie is the origin story of the main character, while all the supporting characters....just sorta show up and jump into the action. This was disappointing because I wanted to know more about all of them and the final fight seemed rushed...very rushed. Avengers and Guardians it is not, but if you got kids they'll LOVE it.

My niece's comments that I am transcribing: It's the best movie ever. She loved Frozen, but she thought this was a little bit better. She thought that one of the most funniest parts was when Baymax was running low on battery life and kept saying, ""Hairy baby,"" while petting the cat. She thought it was cool that Hiro had a peanut allergy because she can relate--her brother has one too.

I loved the Japanese sensibility and visuals, also Hiro's friends from ""nerd school"" were well developed. Hiro himself is a realistic lead character who learns how to be human from his robot pal.",1425081600,,646,4.657894736842105

More ""not white"" characters depicted, and unusual twists to gender norms, I really hope Disney and Marvel keep this up.

So, while Big Hero 6 was chosen as the top animated movie for 2014, since my daughter saw the movie and said it was a lot of fun, I decided to buy it - when I found it on Amazon for just $18 I ordered it from them! So, last night we watched it and I agree with my daughter; Big Hero 6 is a lot of fun! Not only is it very funny, but it has some truly excellent messages in it . . . and a short which could actually have used my grandson Shane and his dog Gimli to film the end in live action!

Big Hero 6
Disney
Rating - PG

Favorite Features -
Excellent animation - love the color and details - adds to the fun of this movie!
Solid messages which families can talk about
Action will capture the interest of children - my grandsons watched this last night at their house with their parents and their dad said they loved it!
Animated movie with a story-line and humor adults will enjoy
Animated short is so funny - and the baby at the end could have been my grandson Shane . . . he regularly tosses his food to his dog Gimli and of course, Gimli is very happy to ""clean up"" after Shane!
Disney says; ""With all the heart and humor audiences expect from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Big Hero 6 is an action-packed comedy adventure which introduces Baymax, a lovable, personal companion robot, who forms a special bond with robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada. When a devastating turn of events catapults them into the midst of a dangerous plot unfolding in the streets of San Fransokyo, Hiro turns to Baymax and his diverse group of friends -- adrenaline junky Go Go Tomago, neatnik Wasabi, chemistry whiz Honey Lemon and fanboy Fred -- who transform into a band of unlikely heroes. Bring home Disney's Big Hero 6, featuring comic-book-style action and hilarious, unforgettable characters -- it's fun for the whole family!""

I totally agree; Big Hero 6 absolutely is ""fun for the whole family""! Action, characters and a story which will capture and keep your attention from the start and leave you cheering at the end, Big Hero 6 is sure to be a family favorite! But, more importantly, this grandma enjoyed the movie because it has some excellent, solid messages for families to talk about. Hiro has to make several choices throughout the movie; will he use his intelligence to bet upon and fight robots (the betting is illegal) or will he go to school to use his gift to help others? Will he respond in anger, hate and revenge or will he forgive and choose not to harm someone who caused him great loss and pain? Will he choose to put himself at risk to help someone who needs his help or protect himself? Throughout their lives our grandchildren will be faced with decisions, too. They will need to learn to make wise choices; choices which show they love God and others and while Big Hero 6 is not a ""Christian"" movie, it does give families the opportunity to talk about making wise choices.

I'm so happy to see this new animated movie from Disney is one which will not only be enjoyed - greatly - but one which challenges children to make wise choices! Big Hero 6 will make an excellent addition to your home movie collection. Tremendously well done, Disney!",1425081600,6,3298,4.42833607907743

6723856,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Pixar delivers again with their newest flick Big Hero 6. This is a visually creative movie about a young boy, Hiro, trying to find his path from the rough streets of robot fighting to an acclaimed university. He is a brilliant adolescent who faces both tragedy and triumph living in San Fransokyo (combo of Tokyo and San Francisco) in this epic movie that shows both highlights of American cinema and Japanese anime. The movie begins with a brief back story of a child living with his aunt and brother after suffering the loss of their parents.  His brother successfully shows Hiro his potential and gets him to apply, and become accepted, into the most prestigious tech school. Hiro suffers even more tragedy and enlists his fellow classmates and robot Baymax (who really stole the show) in his quest to uncover the truth behind a villainous plot that ****SPOILER ALERT**** resulted in the death of his brother.
  Hiro teams up with his class to become a team of super hero nerds that use their knowledge to create some crazy ""super powers"" to try and stop the mysterious figure behind the the evil plot.  It was a fun look at an new superhero team origin story where they were really new to leaving their labs and going to fight the villain.  Baymax was really my focus during the movie, especially in scenes where his battery was low and ended up acting like he had a few too many, if you know what I mean.
  This was a very entertaining movie that definitely kept me, and more importantly my son, entertained throughout the entire adventure.  It had a solid story line that had life lessons as well as childish and adult humor (though the adult stuff went over the head of most kids).  I would absolutely recommend this as a great family movie that follows in the footsteps of other great ones like Wreck it Ralph or The Incredibles. It had everything from the jokes, to the action and awesome visual animation.  This is The Mommy's Guide telling you to get to the theater!  Go Big Hero 6!

6723877,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Disneys animated version of Marvels Big Hero 6 comes home to thrill families. You can now own the movie which rightfully won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. A successful blend of relatable characters, life lessons, and plenty of hilarity and frantic excitement make for an enduring movie which will have you going back for repeated viewings.

In Big Hero 6, Robotics prodigy Hiro (Ryan Potter) lives in the city of San Fransokyo. Next to his older brother, Tadashi, Hiro's closest companion is Baymax (Scott Adsit), a robot whose sole purpose is to take care of people. When a devastating turn of events throws Hiro into the middle of a dangerous plot, he transforms Baymax and his other friends, Go Go Tamago (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller) into a band of high-tech heroes.

Imagine the Avengers if their powers were created and organized by a group of teen tech-geeks at M.I.T. If you can wrap your head around that idea, you know what to expect from Big Hero 6. Each costumed kid has his own unique place on the team. The voice actors who give life to the individual characters pour their hearts, souls, and charisma into each role.

The Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD Collectors Edition of Big Hero 6 features some great bonus material. The charming theatrical short Feast is included. There are also three featurettes entitled The Origin of Big Hero 6: Hiros Journey, Big Hero Secrets, and Big Animator 6: The Characters Behind the Characters for viewers to go behind the scenes of the making of the movie. Deleted scenes such as alternate openings and an intro by the directors are featured.

Big Hero 6 is rated PG for action and peril, some rude humor, and thematic elements. Things get a little deep and dark for younger viewers when the movie focuses on the deaths of some key characters. The comic book violence is less than what weve seen in the live-action Marvel movies.

Although the recognizable logo is nowhere to be found, theres no denying that Big Hero 6 is a Marvel movie animated by Disney. Its a perfect example of a flawless adaption of a comic book property aimed at both kids and adults. Serious subject matter like dealing with the death of loved ones and the importance of life choices are tackled, but made easier to swallow with a big dose of action and humor.

6723889,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I didn't know anything about this movie going in (my daughter dragged me to it). In retrospect I have to wonder what is going on with the Disney marketing machine? How did I not hear about this amazing movie beforehand? About halfway thru the movie I realized that there had not been one misstep in the movie so far (which is an exceedingly rare thing in any movie) and I wondered at what point the movie would falter (surely it had to falter at some point, right?). Well, much to my amazement it managed not to falter. This is a stellar movie and is easily my favorite animated Disney movie of all time. Of course the fact that this movie emphasized scientists over princesses and technology over magic and dialogue over singing probably goes a long way toward explaining my opinion.

Bottom line - this is on par with the best of Pixar.",1424908800,,838,4.477124183006536

It is an excellent story. The kid is a genius in the film, but he is wasting his talent. His brother shows him what he can do no excites him. He creates the ultimate robot. Has to fight an enemy to save the world, rescue the girl, and makes the best friend you could ever want and makes some friends that he will never want to loose. I think this is a more boy geared movie, but girls will like it too. Such a great story. it made me cry, I cry at a lot of movies but not like this one did. I haven't cried at a Disney animated film not like this since Dumbo visited his mom in her prison.

Big Hero 6 is actually a comic that was changed quite a bit to become a family friendly Disney version. The bonus content explains quite a bit about it if you're interested. I took my 2 kids to watch this movie in theater and my daughter (8) cried at the end. They both loved the movie so much that they told me I definitely need to buy it for them. I would have bought it anyways. Haha!",1424908800,5,533,4.037735849056604
6723927,3,B00O4ZC57I,"For Big Hero 6 to win an Oscar tells you something about how much control Disney has over the voting process.  Disney slipped up here; if they'd slapped a few Marvel logos on this it would have performed much better at the box office. Anything with a Marvel logo, no matter how bad it is, will sell these days.

I'm not sure what irks me most about this. The Japanification of San Francisco and 'all American' looking boys and girls with Japanese names seems odd, why not set it in Japan like the comic book or fully Westernize the story?  We have all the stereotypical Disney traits, the mother figure (in this case the aunt) is so annoying that I want to slap her right away.  The story seems a little thin and very well trodden; but most Marvel comics are recycled with tweaks so if you want something that feels familiar this is the movie for you. Big Hero 6 plays it safe, and ultimately that's a let down.

The animation is good, the colors and action pop, the relationship between Hiro and his robot is well rounded, much like Baymax.  It's just another superhero movie, and the market is saturated with them. There are enough redeeming qualities to drag this out of mediocrity, but its simply 'ok'.

As a postscript: it's unforgivable that there is no US release of this movie in 3D. Europe and Asia both have Big Hero 6 in 3D (coming soon). If you have a 3D setup, Big Hero 6 looks excellent in 3D (and would raise my rating by a half star). When the UK 3D blu ray is released I'll report back to let you know if it plays on US players.",1424908800,3,1545,4.3068965517241375

I could say that I bought it for my daughters but let's face it, animated movies rock and I would have bought it even if I didn't have kids.

I went to Comic Con with one of my friends and she was talking about it, so I decided to give it a fighting chance. I'm glad I did, this has all of the elements a movie ought to have. It was funny (without going over the top), serious when it needed to be, and was simply a slice of life. I don't know what else to say. I'm not the best at giving reviews, especially when I'm not trying to give away the plot, but this is something that I would recommend to anybody who needs a refreshing movie with all of the not-so great releases out there.

Yes, there's the typical Disney tragedy early on, but the story line is good, the animation is exceptional, and, most importantly, my kids loved it.

6724005,5,B00O4ZC57I,"We loved this movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect and since Disney movies rarely disappoint, we were excited to see it.  My son is 6 and the first was with a group of boys for a birthday party and they all loved it and were mesmerized by it.  I sat by a college student who teared up several times in the movie.  How I judge if I really like a movie is if I will pay to see it again.  This is one of those movies.  The second time we went the theater was much less crowded.  Even though we had seen it before, 'those' parts were still emotional to see.  I looked over and my 6 year old was wiping tears away several times.

It is a great movie.  It tugs at your heart strings and helps show how kids deal with sad and traumatic situations, how true friendships endure trials, and how the ones you love stay in your heart forever. It's about how revenge and anger can and will eat you alive if you let.  Even kids understand that.

The animation is awesome.  It's a movie you have to see in the theater at least once to get the full effect!  It's now at our dollar theater and I am sure we'll go see it again.",1424736000,,1109,3.981818181818182

6724077,3,B00O4ZC57I,"Loved the movie & I would highly recommend it. However like many other people here, I enjoy 3D movies & would have loved to have been able to purchase a 2D/3D Blu-ray version. I also will NOT be purchasing this movie at this time, as I will hold off purchasing it for as long as the 3D version is being held from sale in the USA.
I give this movie 5 stars for content, however am taking away one star for lack of release of the 3D version, and taking away one star for the disappointment I feel every time a good movie comes out, only to find out that the home release has been ""limited"" in some way by the motives of corporate greed. If it isn't holding back on the 3D version, then it is holding off on releasing the extended versions or some other small perk that they feel they can use to make more money by releasing the ""limited"" versions first, only to release the more ""complete"" versions later...expecting to make more money by getting people to buy both releases.
While I don't expect everyone to want the 3D version, this sort of tactic is like the release of only a DVD version of a movie, with a Blu-ray version being released a couple years later, at a hefty additional price of course...only to be followed with yet another re-re-release of another extended version with additional minutes/scenes, of course sold at a premium price & strategically marketed near some holiday or when the movie's sequel is near release.
Really good movie...really poor marketing & home release/blu-ray.
Reviews here are for the product listed. NOT just a movie review. Many people obviously forget that here, and seem to feel a need to complain about that fact. For a movie review, try a site like IMDB. For a product review, this is where to find one. Like others, I loved this movie, however am really disappointed & upset with how this movie was marketed & sold to us.
For this product, I give only 3 stars. And I am sorry to have to do that.",1424563200,18,1942,4.442577030812325

While I know 3D is not mainstream yet, you need to give it a chance. The people who say they don't care for 3D are mostly those who haven't experienced the new generation of 3D. My audio/video file father in-law said he didn't care for it until he saw this new generation of 3D. Now guess who thinks it's cool!!! Disney you made a ton of money from your 3D releases at the theater. Please follow through to blu ray.....",1424563200,2,555,4.245283018867925

The ending wraps up a little too neatly.",1424476800,3,358,4.430769230769231

There are so many moments of ingenious humor and wit; I was chuckling throughout the movie and constantly surprised with the jokes and plot development. As a technology nerd, I loved the use of the 'soft bot' and the research Disney did.

I never pay attention to bonus content (I bought the movie because i just couldn't wait to see it!) and the bonus content was quite well done too.

This is by far in the top 5 of my favorite Disney movies, if you like the movies I mentioned above you will also really like this movie! Enjoy!",1424476800,,657,4.368852459016393

6724604,1,B00O4ZC57I,"I had order the item months ago and just cancelled my order. My wife and kids saw it in the theater and were talking about how great the movie was. I was surprising them with the movie. I slipped and let my wife know I was ordering it for them and she asked if I got the 3D version because it was the one they saw in the theater. I had no idea it was in 3D. After doing much searching, I found that 3D wasn't available in this country. I decided to cancel my order after I saw that Disney has removed 3D for the US market. I didn't realize Disney was doing this until I started researching things yesterday. I'm saddened they would do this. I know 3D doesn't appeal to everyone but if they are already making region-free 3D prints they could still offer some copies for sale in the US. Obviously, they are doing it for a reason and I will no longer support Disney through media purchases. Well, except for maybe the new Star Wars if they get that right but that's the only tile I will buy after discovering the 3D news.

Save your anti-3D posts, I get that not everyone cares about 3D but I do care about shafting the US customers. The 3D disks are already region free so they are producing a product that could be used in the US. They are flat out choosing not to offer it even in small quantities which would cost them nothing since they can low ball the estimated 3D sales and base production off a lower number. I don't support companies like that and it's my right as a consumer not to support them.",1424217600,17,1504,4.186206896551724

6724609,2,B00O4ZC57I,"I watched this with my niece and nephew and for as good as this movie (kind of) was... I didn't like the fact that Disney made yet ANOTHER movie where the kid has no family. There's basically one adult in Hiro's life and, of coarse, he's smarter than she is because she's pretty much a complete flipping moron. Do they ever tire of making the same old story in different ways ('cause I'm tired of watching it)?! Look...  I'm all about trying to teach kids about real life and the inevitable tragedies that will befall them... as well as teaching them the importance of exercising their brains instead of sitting in front of the TV like mindless zombies, but for Pete's sake can we get a good movie that actually glorifies how IMPORTANT families are? You know like... mom, dad, kid/s, pets, that sort of thing? Without the parents being stupid? And, to all the Disney fan-boys out there who are hatin' on me right now for speaking the truth, please hold all your neo-political B.S. and psycho-mumbo-jumbo, because like a lot of people in this world, I came from a one-adult home AND I'm recently a widower.

Many of the 1 star reviews on this movie are due to the lack of a 3D release, so they aren't reviewing the movie, they are venting their frustrations.

If you are looking for a movie your child will like, this is it. Your child will probably love this movie, boy or girl.
If you are looking for a movie your child will like, that you can also enjoy, this is definitely it.
If you are an adult looking for a movie for yourself, you may have complaints, I don't think you'd hate it, but depending on how critical you can be, you definitely might not love it. Mostly if you are a Marvel fan, I'm sorry I can't comment in regards the direction this movie took, because I simply do not know enough to comment. I saw some Marvel fans who weren't thrilled with this movie though.

It's a good movie with great graphics. I like a good story and I like animated movies, and this is one that I plan to purchase when it's released because I did enjoy it in theaters and I can see myself watching it a few times. The movie carriers a good story and also good tale of family and morals and revenge. My husband and I both enjoyed this movie, and I found it was under hyped, it was better than I expected, but it also may be one of those movies you either love or hate.

I get that there are hefty Asian populations in either city and makes total sense.

Going the San Fransokyo route is just dumb, in my opinion. It's like the producers wanted to pay homage to Tokyo as the birthplace of anime, yet, since it's Disney and they want to cater to the US, let's bastardize San Francisco, so it's ""familiar"" with American audiences.

BayMax is pretty awesome and will melt your heart. Right from the beginning, this movie will have you laughing. Take a look at this movie. Better yet, buy it! Your kids (and I) will be watching this time and time again. Surely, this could have been almost as big as Frozen and it isn't in my eyes a Disney quality movie as they usually come out with Classics with little effort. This is similar feeling to the movie 'Bolt' but multiplied by three. It will probably just remain in the collection -nearly unwatched after a number of years... But it will still bring smiles to my girls playroom and the backseats of my truck and the wifes van for a couple of years to come.

It carries with it several messages regarding character, family, revenge, etc. Disney has done well with this and I was truly amazed at the 3D quality. I have read a lot of reviews stating no 3D. Gotta order from outside USA to get it. No, you do not! I am a subscriber not only to Amazon Prime (movies) but to, Vudu. Just subscribe to Vudu and there they have both the 3D and 2D bundle for sale. By the way, they also have Maleficent in 3D. Just a note to those who are seeking the 3D version. Now, back to the movie. A young genius and a brother, a close knit family until blam tragedy strikes and the world begins to crumble for his younger brother. A great twist using the robot and the conveying of his brother is here. To see how friendship and love come together to defeat evil is a lesson in itself. The ending is well done also with the bot- ah, well maybe you should see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed with the one. I only hope it leads to a sequel.  Oh, and by the way, do not shut the movie off until all the credits have rolled for like Iron Man there is a surprise at the end.

Among the nicely written characters, the nursing robot Baymax is an obvious highlight. The goofy Fred is also very entertaining, though. The setting, a mash-up of Tokyo and San Francisco, is brilliantly realized and modeled. As per the standard of Walt Disney Animation Studios, the graphics are top-notch and the animation is always either lively or spectacular.

The general plot is somewhat formulaic as it goes along the the usual general arc of an origin story for a superhero team. Many scenes, though, show real heart, adding up to a solid overall story. Of course the relation between Hiro and Baymax shows the most emotion. Surprisingly enough, the stereoscopy looks best when showing their fullness during such intimate exchanges.

The neural device he uses to commute with the micro machines would work by receiving a signal. He could simply build another neural device or something to jam that signal. At the end Baymax could simply hold on to the hand he is launching with his other hand in order to make it out of the wormhole.

Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old tech genius who spends his days bored and winning battle-robot matches, until he's taken by brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) to the ""nerd school"" he attends, where Hiro not only meets some of Tadashi's way-cool classmates ... but also Baymax, a ""plus-size"" inflatable vinyl robot Tadashi has created for the sole purpose of helping people who are hurt or ill.  Hiro, dazzled by the school, is determined to win his way in himself - but when a disaster befalls both Hiro and the school, the young genius soon learns his invention has been stolen, and San Fransokyo is under siege.  His answer?  Transforming Baymax and his new friends at the school into high-tech superheros to save the day.

6724666,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Inspired by a little-know Marvel comic book series of the same title, Big Hero 6 is in a way Disneys (or executive producer John Lasseters) stab at the popular superhero genre. But the best part of Disneys new animation is not the action or combat scenes, but the emotional bond between the hero Hiro Hamada, a 14-year-old robotics prodigy and Baymax, a marshmallow-looking healthcare robot his elder brother Tadashi has created. And with its simple design, Baymax manages to be very cute, or kawaii, like Hello Kitty.

Set in San Fransokyo, a futuristic city of an alternative universe, the films story is about a band of ragtag heroes (including Hiro and Baymax) trying to uncover a plot by a mysterious masked villain. Maybe the story is not very original, and the supporting characters tend to be stereotypical, but the friendship between Hiro and Baymax is genuine and very moving. Another merit of the film is the colorful visuals of the city of San Fransokyo, strongly influenced by Japanese pop culture.

Big Hero 6 is an enjoyable family picture with the main characters you can identify with. And don't forget the post-credits sequence, where a certain person makes a guest appearance. After all, this too is based on a Marvel comic.",1423267200,3,1243,4.914285714285715

In Walt Disney's own words, ""I do not make films primarily for children.  I make them for the child in all of us whether we be six, or sixty.""  And ""Big Hero 6"" is a wonderfully thought provoking, yet action packed and humour filled example of this.  Truly a film that anyone of any age can glean something of value from if they are open to it.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Honestly this is a very clean film with no foul language or outright sex.  There is only really one blatant pseudo-innuendo where during a segment where Baymax (who is a medical droid) scans Hiro trying to figure out what ails him (I won't say what his problem actually is, though, since that's a major plot point) .  After the scan, one of the diagnosis that Baymax comes up with is that Hiro is going through puberty and that one of the features is that he'll be growing facial hair, armpit hair, chest hair...and before Baymax can say the last ""area"", Hiro promptly forces a change in topic.

ABOUT THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT SPOILERS):
Overall, I found this film amazing and such a wonderfully inspiring piece.  It has fun characters, a great and well-done storyline, and honestly...it seemed like the production team was having a blast putting this together...that it was a project that meant something to them at a personal level.  It had a fair share of action, but tons of valuable introspective and heartwarming points, as well.  The film may be a liberal take on the original ""Big Hero 6"" comic...but it's a liberal take in the best sense.  Here are a few specifics of some things I liked.

Attention to detail -
The team spent much time in crafting a living, breathing, and vibrant world.  The lighting is stunning and close to believable, and some of the scenic aspects seem like photographs...the only thing giving away the 3D nature of the film being the caricatured characters themselves...but even they look ""normal"" and like they belong.  The scale to which they made the setting teem with life is astounding.  The fact they filled the world with so much traffic and extra characters walking around really amped up the vibrancy and ""life"".  It truly feels like the metropolitan city San Fransokyo was meant to be.  As to the main characters, I loved how elaborate they were.  Not only were their visual designs unique with fleshed out attitudes (which were greatly furthered by the voice actors), each of them also had unique physical mannerisms (i.e. walking, gestures, etc.) that helped establish their identities.

Visual Continuity -
When Big Hero 6 first get their superhero armor, it's totally brand-spanking new and fresh looking.  But as the movie progresses and they face combat situations, the armor suffers dents and scratches which gradually accumulate and stay throughout the movie (since the events roughly take a short amount of time...not enough time to make complete repairs and whatnot).

Team evolution -
Big Hero 6 (the name of the superhero team) take time to find their rhythm as a team...they aren't immediately cohesive.

Humour:
This film, is actually a very serious and thoughtful film...much more than the trailers suggest.  But it's not with out its moments of humour.  The timing and placement was some of the best I had seen in a long time.  And I loved that the jokes and gags were pulled off in a non-excessive manner...but in a much more subtle and natural way.  There are also tons of cute moments.

Thematic Elements -
The biggest draw for me, though, is the story and the themes it deals with.  The backbone of this film is the strong bond the brothers have.  I'm glad that they weren't stereotypically adversarial towards each other.  From the get-go they have each others back.  That set-up may sound ""boring"" on paper versus the cliched ""brothers-that-hate-each-other-only to-find-each-other-in-the-end""...but it proves to be very defining and lead to some of the most touching and inspiring sequences.  Their bond truly serves as a catalyst for many decisions made by Hiro.  I also loved how Hiro's situation is actually contrasted by another character.  it serves as a great way to present and discuss the themes of loss, support, and healing.  I loved also how it dealt with friendship and being each others backbone.  Such a variety of characters with their own quirks, strengths, and failings coming together to support each other was heartwarming to me.  Also, one of the most important themes to me from this film was how one person's life example can teach the greatest of moral lessons in a way that no textbook can.  Finally, I loved that Hiro was placed in a position where HE had to be the one to make a difficult decision...no one forced him, it was not made for him, no one acted impulsively before he could make a call...it was all in his hands...and that is a reality of life that isn't often seen in films.

Parallels -
This one, I can't really give specifics because I would have to do major plot spoils for that.  But I'll try and explain it this way: for some events that a character has to go through, another character serves as a foil to it.  Also, the film is circular...you begin to see qualities of a character introduced in the beginning in another character later on in the film.

Origin Story -
This film is very much an origin story, and I thought that was a really brilliant idea.  This is key since they took a lot of liberties from the source material (again, ""liberties"" in the best sense of the word), so it was important in helping build personal audience connection to the characters by having them gradually rise to their destinies rather than be straight up heroes to begin with.  Nothing does that better than an origin story.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
Included were several special features: Some deleted scenes, a 15-minute  ""making-of"" documentary, a 7-minute interview with the animation team, and the Film Short, ""Feast"".

This is actually one of the few times that I can say that all of the extras are valuable. I generally dislike deleted scenes...but the producers did so well in not only showing them, but introducing them and explaining why they removed it.  As to the Film Short, it was very heartwarming and cute...I shed a little tear for that one.  But the biggest gems for me were the documentary & interview.  They were very insightful though short.  Here are just three interesting bits I learned from them:

 This first one is quite amusing.  One of the animators on the team was tasked with designing a beautiful looking ""Aunt Cass"".  As he started sketching her out, he was subconsciously adding features that his own wife has...and he didn't realize it until his other fellow animators started commenting that ""Aunt Cass"" is looking more and more like his wife.  Second, to help define the characters' mannerisms, they did what they called a ""cafe test"" (and they show you clips, too, of it!).  Finally, director Don Hall doesn't have any brothers.  And since the film centers around that brotherly relationship, he wanted to find a frame of reference.  Thus, he called together a ""brother summit"" where everyone on the team that had brothers would discuss their feelings, experiences, and relationships with their brothers.  Besides helping him better understand, it also had the unexpected effect of the team investing personally and emotionally in the film as well.

ALL IN ALL:
All in all, this is such a wonderful and thought provoking film.  It legitimately feels like a superhero film...but with the Disney magic and qualities.  It has memorable and relatable characters and an intriguing storyline.  The quality of animation surpasses much of what they have done in past 3D features, as well.  This is one that kids can easily enjoy for it's action and humor...but for older or more introspective viewers, there is a lot of food for thought.  It is inspiring and heartwarming...and will leave you encouraged and refreshed knowing that you can be more than you are.  By the end, you realize that this film embodies another one of Mr. Disney's mantras: ""The greatest moments in life are not concerned with selfish achievement but rather with the things we do for the people we love and esteem.""

It is a story of self discovery and coming of age. It is a one of a kind Disney classic filled with great comedy, pulse pounding action and tons of heart. It is incredible to see a film with all of those elements coming together so perfectly. There are a few things in this film that aren't perfect and that is the lack of development of supporting cast members. While they still are likable, you would appreciate there being more to them. This film has a excellent voice cast and some of the best CGI animation I had experienced in a long while, especially from a Disney film. This film captures everything geeky from comic books to anime and it all gets wrapped up in a package called Baymax, who is undoubtedly one of the best creations Disney has added to their list of classic characters.

Disney has risen from the ashes of the post renascence era and begun a new and I am very excited for the next classics to be release from Disney in the coming years.

6724685,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Before we get to ""Big Hero 6"", lets talk about Feast, the new animated short presented before the feature film. It tells the tale of Winston, a little hungry puppy who is adopted by a man. The entire short depicts the man's life as seen through the food he feeds his ever voracious dog.

We never see the man, or any other humans, in their entirety, but we get all of the emotion of their life by what we glimpse in the periphery. And a lot of the story is also told through the human food Winston is allowed to eat.

""Feast"" is a fun, fast-paced, beautifully animated way to start off the show.

There is a lot of ""Big Hero 6"" that they don't show in the trailers, a lot they don't even hint at. Which is a good thing. The trailers really concentrate on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, the large, inflatable health care robot that Hiro turns to when he needs a superhero. This is to the film's benefit. This is the best part of the film and the trailer gets us hooked on their story before we even walk into a theater.

Don't get me wrong. ""Big Hero 6"", the first animated collaboration between Disney and Marvel, is a great hybrid, bringing everything you love about a Disney film (with some clear Pixar influences) to many of the great elements that make the Marvel action films so enjoyable. But some of these elements don't translate from live action to animation so well.

Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) is a super-smart kid living in San Fransoyko with his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Tenney, TV's ""Hawaii Five-O"", X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and their Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Bridesmaids"") in the upstairs apartment of an old Victorian, just over the cafe Aunt Cass runs. Tadashi, a student at the robotics lab of a prestigious university, is concerned that his brother is wasting his intelligence making robots designed for Bot Fighting, an illegal activity. He takes Hiro for a visit to his school and introduces him to Baymax (Scott Adsit, TV's ""30 Rock""). This visit inspires Hiro to enter the Academy's contest awarding a full scholarship as grand prize. The Academy's director, Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell) and a prominent businessman, Alistair Kriel (Alan Tudyk, TVs Suburgatory!, Frozen) are both very impressed by Hiro's invention, but for very different reasons. Soon, Hiro finds he needs to rely on his brother's friends, Go Go (Jamie Chung, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, TVs Once Upon A Time, Believe), a student working on a bike with magnetic wheels, Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr., The Other Guys, Lets Be Cops), who is working on a super laser, Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez, Identity Thief, What to Expect When Youre Expecting), the girly-girl who is working on creating chemical reactions and Fred (T.J. Miller, Transformers: Age of Extinction, How To Train Your Dragon), the skate board dude who hangs around just because he likes it, to help him fight the super villain who steals his invention, using it for no good.

Written by Jordan Roberts (""That's Not You""), Daniel Gerson & Robert Baird (both of whom worked on ""Monsters University"", ""Cars"", ""Monsters, Inc."") and directed by Don Hall (""Winnie the Pooh (2011)"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt""), ""Big Hero 6"" creates some of the most memorable characters to come out of a Disney film since, well, ""Frozen"". Okay, that's not that long ago. But the work in ""Big Hero 6"" coming so soon after ""Frozen"" proves the Mouse House may be experiencing another renaissance, much like they did a few decades ago with ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"".

Disney has a thing about their main characters experiencing patricide. Their most famous classics actually show us the moment when the loss occurs and this helps us immediately connect to the character. In ""Big Hero 6"", both Hiro (subtle. I didn't even notice that until now) and Tadashi live with their aunt  something happened to their parents, we just don't know what, we can only guess. So Hiro and Tadashi have a strong bond. Older brother naturally feels like the protector for his younger brother, but Hiro is an independent kid with a lot of smarts. Their relationship is fun and heartfelt and very moving.

The trailer concentrates on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, the inflatable robot who resembles the Pillsbury Dough-boy or the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. And once they meet and start to get to know one another, you really feel the magic the filmmakers  create. Baymax, designed to be a sort of Nurse Practitioner, is gentle, awkward and lovable. He also has great difficulty adapting to what Hiro wants him to do, so these moments add a lot of laughter, making the duo even more endearing.

But there is so much more going on. We first meet Hiro at a Bot Fight. Tadashi is upset that his brother is wasting his intelligence on something like this, he should join the academy where he studies and put his brains to good use. He coaxes Hiro into visiting his academy and Hiro's quick realization that he should, in fact, attend the school is a great illustration of the type of relationship these two share. It is also funny and inspiring. You kind of wish every young teen had the same opportunity to be influenced by something positive.

After the invention is stolen, Hiro begins to investigate and runs into some trouble that he can't handle on his own with just Baymax. He turns to Tadashi's friends, who are only too eager to help. They quickly adopt what each person is working on, with a few adjustments from Hiro, to create each person's super hero identity. Hiro and Baymax are two, adding Fred, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Go Go makes Big Hero 6. Forming the group, working on their individual identities and then training all provide a lot of great funny and exciting moments. Not to mention some great animation.

And the filmmakers have even included a few surprising moments in this sequence, giving a couple of the characters some unexpected traits and background. It is nice work.

The entire cast does outstanding work bringing their characters to life. Scott Adsit is particularly endearing and funny as Baymax. He brings a very innocent quality to the robot, helping him seem like a giant child, which makes him all the more lovable. And there are some great moments showing how Baymax adapts to his new mission and surroundings. Adsits voice work makes this character extremely engaging to watch. Its a bit like watching a more vocal E.T. Ryan Potter is also very good as Hiro. Because he is a pre-teen, Hiro is beyond the cutesy-pie stage of some animated heroes, and he feels he has to demonstrate his independence at every turn. Which is why he is so resistant to visit Tadashi's academy in the first place. Potter brings just the right mix of pre-teen pluck to the role of a boy who is super-intelligent but who still has to learn to communicate. Each of the other members of the band of heroes is very good and helps them stand out as individuals. For me, the real standout in this group is T.J. Miller. A lot of this has to do with the fact that there is a lot about his character that comes as a surprise, making him funny and unique. But Miller's slacker/surfer dude delivery helps to cement this image of him.

""Hero"" is set in San Fransokyo, presumably a little in the future and has a lot of Japanese influences (the people, the architecture, the lifestyles) which seem to be a nod to anime. I am not sure what the significance is of this choice, beyond the influence of Japanese animation. At times, it feels like one of those alternate realty episodes of a sci-fi show, the type where Kirk and Spock visit a New York reflecting the defeat of the Allies in World War II, with German influences and SS officers everywhere. I don't think this is the idea behind the Japanese influences, but without a more concrete explanation, I found my mind jumping here on occasion.

This isn't exactly a problem and it leads to some really beautiful shots. When Hiro and Baymax fly through the skies over San Fransokyo, we are treated to some beautiful shots of a Japanese-influenced Golden Gate Bridge. There are also large helium balloons flying over the entire city, representations of animals that look like they are pulled from a Miyazaki film. They dart in and out, around and over these floats. Again, not sure why they are included, but they look great and make the film more fun.

The villain, who wears a kabuki mask and uses Hiro's stolen invention, is a pretty threatening individual. But this is where the lack of information in the trailer begins to fall short. Because of the concentration on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, there is no hint that there is even a super villain. Of course, you have to expect such a thing, Hiro isn't designing a superhero suit for Baymax for no reason. When the villain first appears, it is a little bit of a shock. And as the narrative continues, he appears to be pulled out of the Marvel Universe, the clear influence. Looking back at Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" directed by Brad Bird (one of my favorite films), the villain in the superb animated feature seems to belong to that world, he matches the style, look and feel of the rest of the film. In ""Big Hero"", the villain seems more like he should be in a live action Marvel film. He doesn't match the other characters.

The big battle between Hiro, his friends and the villain also seems more at place in a Marvel film. ""Big Hero"" is the first collaboration between Marvel and the animation part of the Mouse House, so this makes sense, but the expected is not what you really want from any film, let alone one that has been so great and so unexpected to this point.

""Big Hero 6"" is a delightful animated film, with a lot of great stuff going on. Drawing influences from Marvel and Pixar, this Disney film is the first in a while to appeal primarily to boys. And it is really good. There are a lot of great, almost magical moments. And there are a few missteps.

""Big Hero 6"" is a lot of fun and worth a trip to the theater.

The action is, of course, stylistic and appropriate for a younger audience (this isn't the avengers after all).The film is packed with a full range of lovable characters, played by a very talented voice cast. Scott Adsit gives Baymax a personality that viewers will fall in love with, while Ryan Potter portrays Hiro with honesty and skill. T.J. Miller is just plain hilarious as Fred, and James Cromwell provides Professor Callaghan with rich talent. The film is packed full of cameos, visual puns, and Easter eggs. The observant viewer will notice references to James Cromwells previous role in the film I, Robot as Dr. Alfred Lanning, and a number of other hidden goodies. Although this isn't The Incredibles, Big Hero Six proves that Disney certainly knows what they are doing when it comes to CGI movies and superheroes. Some people may think this movie is too childish, but it depends on your point of view. If you like movies that your whole family can see together, you've found one!",1422230400,8,1640,4.778169014084507

Love the movie. Kids loved it. Has quite a heart and lots of humor and adventure and the 3D was pretty excellent -- in the theater of course.
This started for me with Frozen, which we saw twice in the theater and were pretty surprised how much the 3D presentation enhanced the experience. It certainly doesn't for every movie and we watch tons of 3D movies. Imagine my disappointment when I saw that Disney wouldn't sell the superior version of the film that was created, but only the flat version. This is a movie where the creators put some serious thought in how to use the 3D space to the point that it really enhanced the experience, yet it is thrown aside for home viewers. Just charge me more and stop forcing me to other markets and imports, please.

I don't usually support ""stunt"" ratings with 1-star, but I can't help feeling this might be one of the better ways to draw attention to the issue. Apologies to the creators of the film who had part of their vision crushed by the stripping of 3D from their home release.

Disney was all over 3D Blu-Ray when the hardware first came out, and was one of the reasons that I made the investment in 3D, now suddenly, they've essentially dropped support for the home 3D format in favor of digital streaming. Even more irritating is that most of these titles are available on 3D Blu-Ray in the European market. Why does Disney snub the U.S. Market in this way? Is their next move going to be shutting down the U.S. theme parks and making everybody travel to Europe or Asia to enjoy the parks?",1421971200,39,639,4.47008547008547

Just to help other customers, here is my own discovery list so far on other US made 3D movies that were withheld from the US Blu-Ray Market and (in brackets) where I bought them.

Ratatouille [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray]  (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Need for Speed [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray] (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Maleficent (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray) (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Frozen [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray] [Region Free] (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Oz the Great and Powerful [Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray] [Region Free] (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Up (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray) [Region Free] - Released in the USA much later. (Sold by: Amazon EU S.a.r. L.)
Planes 2 Fire and Rescue (Blu-Ray 3D + Blu-ray) (Available from the Mexico mail order market).
Big Hero 6 (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray) (Amazon in India, but not shipping to the USA yet)

I can confirm all the 3D discs marked as ""region free"" play fine in the US, but some of the 2D Blu-Rays included proved to be ""Region B"".  Some of these movies (like OZ) are simply outstanding in home video 3D and are a must-have.

Lacking any explanation from Disney on this, my guess is they are withholding these titles to bundle with exclusive hardware deals, streaming exclusives, or perhaps some future 4k UHD promotion.  If you are equally disgusted with this market manipulation as I am, I would suggest buying overseas or otherwise obtain them ""outside"" channels :)",1421798400,80,1542,4.647058823529412

6724701,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Disney has made VERY substantial business moves acquiring not only Marvel, but Lucasfilm as well. Upon my further research, I discovered that Big Hero 6 is actually a Marvel based team. And not surprisingly, Disney/Marvel have made a HIT with Big Hero 6.

The movie opens introducing us to Hiro who is at the moment battling an adult in a robotic war. Clearly possessing scientific/robotics knowledge, Hiro's older brother Tadashi takes Hiro to his university's robotic lab to try to convince Hiro to join college. It is here that Hiro meets Baymax, and little does Hiro (and Baymax) know, they are both headed for an unforgettable adventure.

Ryan Potter provides his vocal talents to character Hiro and does a great job being the primary lead role. Hiro is inventive, but has a sensitive side which blends well into the theme of the story. Scott Adsit lends his voice playing character Baymax and he is hilariously a joy to watch throughout the film. Baymax and Hiro's bond is strong and there are definitely some heartfelt moments between these two. Daniel Henney voices Tadashi and does a Fantastic job being a guide and a sort of mentor like figure to Hiro. Actor James Cromwell voices as Professor Callaghan and does a great job.

One thing that continues to fascinate me with Disney (especially the animated movies) is how close their movies can hit home. Big Hero 6 has action and comedy, but even with that Big Hero 6 displays emotional resonance in certain scenes that did cause me to tear up. And I like how a movie-no matter if it is animated or live action-can balance drama, action, comedy or whatever genre it may be, and be successful at it. The animation in Big Hero 6 is Very well crafted, and Big Hero 6 capitalizes off of a fun, uplifting story, insanely good detailed animation, and the actors who lend their voice to this Great film.

Even though I am none too pleased with the overall results of the Academy Awards(meaning there are more actors/actresses/films I would have like to seen nominated) I am eager to see who will win the Best Animated Feature Award this year. How To Train Your Dragon 2(which I will review in the coming weeks) had been my initial pick to win the Gold, but I could definitely see Big Hero 6 taking home the gold as well. At any rate, Big Hero 6 is

A Great Experience

To Disney's credit, they break new ground with an animated film where the protagonist hails from a single to no parent home. Oh wait a minute, that is just about every animated Disney movie now that I think about it. It is as if Disney is championing the practices of Planned Parenthood by glorifying broken homes.

Wasabi, is your total neat freak and is just a kind, awesome character (not to mention his name is hilarious). There's Gogo, the adrenaline junkie, with that awesome bad-girl attitude, she really adds to the movie.  Now, there's Fred.  He is basically the comic relief, and he has quite a surprise up his sleeve. Of course, there is your main character, Hiro.  He is a genius, although he is still fourteen, so he still has his limits.  Last but not least, there's Baymax.

Those friends of mine will be really surprised when they see it for the first time, and they will probably regret not have seen it in the theaters. Can't believe more people were interested in Frozen than they were with this movie. Don't get me wrong I LOVED Frozen but I thought sometimes people over did it. Like they hyped it up way too much. As for this one, we haven't hyped it up enough. Frozen was targeted for the little girls of the audience, but we all ended up falling in love with it because of the complex storytelling, characters, and of course the music! The same will goes for this movie except it's targeted towards the little guys and it's not exactly a musical. Very complex and awesome plot that no one will expect, and characters that are so lovable and real in the way they deal with their problems (even if this story is unrealistic).

6724718,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Set in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo, a hybrid of Tokyo and San Francisco, ""Big Hero 6"" tells the story of Hiro Hamada, a young robotics mastermind who participates in illegal robot fighting games. After Hiro's surprising win in a fight, he gets in trouble and is rescued by his older brother, Tadashi. Tadashi, who is studying robotics, takes Hiro to his lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology to persuade him to use his knowledge for better purposes. In the lab, Hiro is introduced to Tadashi's friends. Hiro also meets Baymax, an inflatable healthcare robot developed by his brother, and Professor Callaghan, the head of the robotics program at the university.

Inspired by Tadashi's friends and their experiments, Hiro decides to get into the robotics program by participating in the annual robotics exhibition. After weeks of hard work, Hiro invents microbots, a new type of nanorobots that can be telepathically controlled and form any shape or structure by joining together. When the day comes, Tadashi and his friends accompany Hiro to the exhibition. However, when a major accident occurs, his microbots seem to be destroyed. After a few weeks, he finds traces of the bots, implying that they may have been stolen. Hiro uses his expertise to find and stop whoever stole the microbots.

There are multiple reasons to like ""Big Hero 6"" as a teenager or an adult, mainly because Disney has worked hard to make sure that the screenplay and design are as realistic as possible. Although kids may not be particularly interested in the science behind the superpowers of the characters, a more mature and educated audience will enjoy the futuristic technology that is brought to life in this film.

""Big Hero 6"" enjoys the advantage of a script that has the essences of a Marvel film mixed up with the lovely characters of the Disney universe. Although follows the formula of many other successful superhero movies and rarely goes off the track, ""Big Hero 6"" recreates the pattern in a way that is fresh and satisfying. However, ""Big Hero 6"" has several plot twists and surprises that make it stand out among other familiar stories.

As far as the graphics and design go, ""Big Hero 6"" is a masterpiece. Disney has clearly been using powerful workstations with powerful processors in order to create the film's detailed characters and setting, which contains thousands of highly detailed buildings, vehicles, objects, and people. The city of San Fransokyo is a futuristic simulation of San Francisco with a Tokyo makeover, bringing together a mixture of western and eastern architecture. ""Big Hero 6"" presents a layered environment such that every scenic view of the city is detailed to the smallest bits, and with the 3D technology stretching the background and giving depth to each object, the audience can expect the visuals to exceed their expectations.

6724722,3,B00O4ZC57I,"This is an intriguing Disney film done in anime style with an anime storyline. Hiro Himada is a young teen with a gift for robotics. He idolizes his brother and inherits his own creation, a carer robot called Baymax. Baymax hardly seems to be a robot, he looks more like a marsh-mellow man, with a gentle disposition to match. His programming is to help his patient recover and feel better. There are some lovely moments here. It is quite amusing and also quite beautiful. Then there is a twist, where Hiro reconditions Baymax to be a fighting robot. A group of friends are also transformed into superheroes as well and together they all confront a villain who is misusing a truly remarkable robotic creation.

I saw this with my son, who is not quite five. There are a few strong themes, particularly death. He seemed ok with this and told me he was not frightened. He also didn't seem put out by the several big fight scenes in the second half of the film. To me it seemed a slightly strange film, with two distinct elements. It was odd to see the gentle Baymax become a warrior, though it was done with an eye to his true nature and with some very amusing passages. As such, I can say that the film managed to entertain us both, despite the 44 year age gap. I feel it is still best seen by children closer to ten though. I'm also not sure it'll bear repeat viewings as say 'Dispicable Me 2' does but it has some lovely elements and some heart. These do jar slightly with the usual superhero/villian violence but the fresh angle makes it something worth seeing. 3 1/2 stars",1420243200,18,1575,4.431034482758621

A young orphaned (of course) robotics prodigy faces a series of personal challenges that create a superhero team (once again of course).

What did I think?

Parents of sons are about to discover the intense fandom that parents of daughters have been going through these past 12 months with Frozen (minus the musical numbers). But what Big Hero 6 lacks in songs it makes up in characters, heart and sheer chutzpah.

A beautiful blend of action and humor will appeal to kids as young as 4 and to us slightly bigger kids at <age redacted>. Dripping with emotion, this film is actually more about grief than altruism but the lessons get learned along the way regardless. Albeit in a superhero costume.

6724733,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Though it does stray from the original source material, as a fan of the comic that inspired this movie, I have to applaud Disney because I liked this more than the comic! SanFranksokyo was an amazing world to look at, and throughout the film, many mature themes were presented. We were encouraged to look at education in a positive light, that girls can be both smart and beautiful instead of one over the other (and this is true in real life, that many beautiful girls are very intelligent) and that as painful as death and loss may be, we can always look to a brighter future. If SanFransokyo were real, I would LOVE to live there.

While Disney has disappointed me with recent films, I was very impressed with Big Hero 6, and its themes of redemption, revenge and loss. I really hope we get more films like this that embrace intelligence, tackle mature themes and still manage to give you that warm fuzzy feeling you used to get when their movies were the best. Highly recommended!!

Plus, we FINALLY get a movie that doesn't star white people! YAY! ( I am white, but come on, the world is made up of many different people. We need more diversity in our films.) Hiro and Tadashi have a very strong brotherly bond, and when something happens, your emotions will be messed with.

After the death and Hiro's invention being stolen, he vows payback...but how? He creates superheroes of his nerd friends, giving them powers based on their nerd-ness.

The film borrows some ideas and lines from other films and I wished I had seen more battle bots, but such was not the case. The film used/misused a lot of the new cutting edge nanotechnology extrapolating it to a fun degree.

So does it make me feel better when I hurt others? Good question.

Use your brains for something upbuilding and positive. Do something good for others. And if you meet angry people try to understand what is behind the mask and maybe with some help there might be hope to turn away from feelings of revenge and all those destructive traits.

It lacked so many things. There was no character development AT ALL, except for Hiro and Baymax. Why have the other four heroes? The super hero aspect was not needed; they could have stopped the villain (who also served as little purpose as the other lackluster cast) without being superheroes randomly out of nowhere.
The characters were stereotypical and cliched, in fact, the whole film was a cliche. There was alos nothing fresh or unique about this story.
A forgettable and unenjoyable film. WDAS's worst since Chicken Little.

Big Hero 6 was more like Big Hero 2 with their horrendously lack of creating and showcasing interesting and strong characters.

6724741,5,B00O4ZC57I,"I find it rather interesting that, in a year FULL of recognizable superhero faces in film, the two superhero films that will be remembered the fondest are the ones spawned from comic books that no one has ever heard of before.  Guardians of the Galaxy and Disneys latest gem, Big Hero 6, have the reviews to back up their critical appeal and audience support.  They have staked a claim in the box office race and have established themselves as two of the most memorable films of the year.  Who would have guessed that the world would forget that a Spider Man movie was even released this year or that the two worlds of the X-Men cohabitated for a few hours?  Instead, were all talking about the rise of Chris Pratt and the world of San Fransokyo!

Disney has been on a serious roll as of late.  Last decade they felt sort of irrelevant, with Pixar completely annihilating them in storyboards and visual presentation, but then 2010 brought them their biggest critical and commercial success in years, Tangled, and things started to change for them.  They followed that up with Wreck-It Ralph, which was such an incredibly inspired departure for Disney and, for me, established their newfound creativity.

Then they conquered the world with Frozen.

This year they delivered their first superhero animated adaptation since purchasing the rights to the Marvel universe, and it comes with a lot of hype, anticipation and, after their recent successes, expectation.  The world is waiting with baited breath to discover if Disney is able to follow up their biggest success EVER with a film just as worthy.  Big Hero 6 was a serious risk, but not the risk one may initially assume.  In fact, it was a smart risk.  Sure, your average superhero fan will have no idea who these characters are, and yet that doesnt really matter much, like it did with Guardians of the Galaxy (which really didn't matter much in the end since WOM was so strong and the film lived up, so it KILLED at the box office), because Disney already has a built in fan base and legions of children who will drag their parents to the movies regardless of whether or not theyve ever heard of Baymax.  Its a smart risk because tackling an unknown entity offers Disney the opportunity to basically recreate this world, Disney it all up for families and not really offend anybody.

Just Google the original comic series and youll see just how Disneyd up this whole movie really was!

The question is, does Big Hero 6 live up to the promise?  Is this a worthy follow up to the massive success of Frozen?  Did Disney succeed in officially reclaiming their place as the go-to studio for animated adventures?

Pretty much, yes.

Sitting in the theater with my son on my lap, indulging in his first superhero movie and watching his face aglow during the explosions of color illuminating the screen, it was evident that Disney had achieved something very special here.  This is a beautifully constructed film that appeals to everyone, young and old, does justice to a genre while bringing things to a level that feels appropriate for a certain age range (lets face it, most superhero movies are just not appropriate for the average Disney fan), never stripping the film of qualities that make it so exciting and accessible.  Yes, there are flaws, but those flaws never take away from the end result, from the reason to keep watching and to anticipate the inevitable sequel.

The film starts tells the story of young Hiro and his brother Tadashi.  Both are incredible smart and gifted, and yet only Tadashi has put his intelligence to good use.  His younger brother, Hiro, obviously still effected from the loss of their parents, uses his intelligence to engage in illegal bot fighting in some unsavory places.  Then inspiration hits and Hiro attempts to clean up his act only to face incredible tragedy with his brother is killed in a freak fire.

Then things get complicated.

A sinister force is lurking in San Fransokyo, and that force has a connection to Hiro and his inventions.  So, with the help of a robotic nurse known as Baymax (Tadashis great invention) and a group of nerds, Hiro forms a team of superheroes from the ground up, utilizing their minds too upgrade their bodies and fight this creepy man in a kabuki mask and his micro-bot army.

Visually, Big Hero 6 is rather remarkable.  The colors, the lighting, the use of CGI enhancements; there are moments when the cinematography is comparable to that found in live action films, creating an expanse and exterior skyline that is so rich with texture and life.  It breathes.  The character development is a tad clich&eacute;d, and I do find this a shame to a degree, considering the source material was so vastly different they could have used that inspiration to flesh out this group of characters past the obvious personalities.  Hiro and Baymax feel full-bodied, but the rest of the team is basically a series of odd names and personality stereotypes.  Tough girl, hyper girl, rich idiot, scaredy-cat.  There isn't any real depth other than the fact that they are all united by the bond of death (of a friend).  Still, the development of the relationship between Hiro and Baymax and the connection to Tadashi is rather beautifully conveyed, and it is that relationship that glows throughout the films running time.

In fact, my only real qualm here comes in the disappointment with the films score, which is so bland and never really ignites where it should, and this is a real shame since Henry Jackmans score for Disneys Wreck-it Ralph was so inspired and one of my favorites of the year.

Big Hero 6 is big, bold and exciting, and it makes the best use of its time by developing a story (and at least one beautiful relationship) AND delivering on the action.  The set up for the sequel is clear, and Im all in for it.  Sure, this wasn't The Incredibles and the final act of self-sacrifice was not as emotionally stirring as the one depicted in Wreck-it Ralph (like, I bawled), but Big Hero 6 certainly continues Disneys meteoric rise back to the top of their industry and confirms our already cemented love of all things Disney.",1418169600,11,6150,4.737089201877934

6724744,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a cute, family-friendly movie that had my 6-year-old nephew cracking up throughout the entire movie, and me laughing along in most spots as well.

The movie is based on a Marvel comic that I hadn't heard of until after I saw the movie. I thought the movie seemed to have a comic sort of vibe, and once I spotted a Stan Lee cameo, my thoughts were confirmed. Upon leaving the movie and looking up more info, I learned that the movie took a lot of liberty with these characters and this part of the Marvel Universe. However, the movie does set it up to possibly do more movies with these characters, and I like the idea of a Disney Animation Studios superhero series that is aimed at kids.

I've gotten off-topic, but the movie centers around Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, who live with their aunt. Tadashi goes to a robotics college, while Hiro is a 14-year-old genius that graduated high school at 13 and hasn't decided what to do yet. He loves making robots and entering underground bot battles, until Tadashi brings him to his school to meet some of his friends and see what kind of robotics they're developing at college, prompting Hiro to invent an impressive microbot in efforts to get into this school.

If you've seen any trailers you probably already know that Hiro's brother is going to die, but the movie takes the time to develop and establish Hiro and Tadashi's relationship first. Despite this, the death scene is treated in a way that isn't too in-your-face and emotional, which I appreciated because it didn't seem to faze or upset too many kids in the audience. It also meant that I wouldn't be crying like a baby like I did at the beginning of Up!, although I think that resulted in me not feeling quite as emotionally invested or connected to the characters in this movie.

After Tadashi dies, Hiro eventually teams up with Baymax, a healthcare robot developed by Tadashi that resembles the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man a bit, and Tadashi's friends to find the villain who killed Tadashi and stole Hiro's microbots.

This movie was funny throughout, and had some pretty neat gadgets and inventions. I thought this movie was a good movie for children because it addressed death and loss without being too emotional, and also showed how great it is to use all of your skills and not be afraid to be smart or creative. It had some good messages and surprisingly seemed to make kids actually think through the use of some plot twists that, while probably pretty obvious to adults, seemed to trick all of the kids in the audience in a thought-provoking way. (At my theater, I heard shocks of awe and exclamations of surprise from many children throughout the theater, and many kids nearby were guessing out loud whodunnit or how the mystery would play out.)

As is to be expected from Disney Animation movies of late, the visuals were really fun to look at. The setting was especially fun, as it took place in San Fransokyo, a hybrid Tokyo/San Francisco city. The city landscapes were beautiful, as you could recognize some of the most distinct parts of San Francisco, with some definite Japanese influences.

Overall, this was a cute family film. It wasn't too short or too long, and it seemed to keep most adults and children entertained. There were some really funny parts, and some good messages. I really liked all of the characters, but didn't feel as much of a connection to them as I do to some Disney or Pixar movies, and this one didn't tug on my heartstrings as much as others, so I can't give it a 5, but I would rate it 3 1/2 to 4 stars.

As an aside, there was an adorable short at the beginning of this movie called Feast, that is definitely worth a watch, if anyone has an opportunity to do so.",1417824000,5,3740,4.563338301043219

My only complaint (why i gave 4 stars not 5) is that there is zero to no clothes for girls!!! If you find any shirts or clothes its ALL in the boys section..i mean girls can still wear it as my daughter does but the fit is not the same :/  theres not much toys either..theres a good handful but again finding the 2 girl characters are kinda hard!

That said, the film isn't quite about what you might think from the trailers. It's not so much ""a boy and his robot"" as it is ""a boy helps form a super-science hero team, one of which happens to be a robot."" ""Big Hero 6"" doesn't refer to a person, it refers to the team of six heroes, all of them powered by cutting-edge sci-fi technology.  One of the powerful and welcome messages that comes through in this film is that the pursuit of science is important, but it is only as good or bad as the person wielding it.

Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a 13-year-old robotics genius who lives with his Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph) and older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney).  Hiro is fond of engaging in illegal robot fighting to earn some money, which Tadashi recognizes is the wrong path for a prodigy like his little brother. He encourages Hiro to apply to the robotics lab at Tadashi's university, where the entrance exam is determined by a science competition.  Hiro enters his nanobots.

Nanobots are game-changers and the power Hiro demonstrates is both breathtaking and terrifying. It's not long before a fire breaks out at the competition, a tragedy that results in the loss of the nanobots.  Hiro mopes about, listless, until he accidentally stumbles upon Tadashi's crowning achievement: Baymax, an inflatable medical robot dedicated to helping people. You can see where this is going, right?

Hiro slowly unravels the mystery behind the fire -- BIG SPOILER 6! It was no accident -- and creates a team of superheroes by retrofitting Baymax and drawing on the collective genius of Tadashi's colleagues.  There's Fed (T.J. Miller) the stoner who likes kaiju movies with a fire-breathing suit to match; Gogo Tomago (Jamie Chung) who uses electromagnetic wheels as skates and weapons; Wasabi (Damon Wayans) who wields laser cutters on his forearms; and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) who has a purse-full of sticky goo bombs.

The heart of the movie revolves around Baymax. He is a soft, huggable helper spawned from the ideals of Tadashi -- but his armor and weapons are all Hiro's youthful rage. Baymax waffles between these two ideologies throughout the film, but it's ultimately Hiro's choice to be a hero.

The superhero tropes don't always make sense (Wasabi's laser hands seem like the worst power) but it's easy to overlook in light of the beautifully rendered, diverse futurescape that is San Fransokyo. It also features a kid who overcomes his challenges with science. My son gave it five stars.",1417392000,3,2776,4.910256410256411
6724750,2,B00O4ZC57I,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

'Big Hero 6' is based on an obscure Marvel comic series that was adapted by Disney and reconfigured into a 3D computer-animated superhero comedy. The characters function in San Fransokyo, a mash-up obviously of San Francisco and Tokyo. At first I thought this might be a city in a future USA where somehow Japanese culture became overwhelmingly influential but it turns out the city is entirely mythical (wouldn't it have been more realistic to use China as a model for some kind of future transfiguration?).

Nevertheless, the protagonist here is Hiro Himada, a 14 year old Japanese-American robotics prodigy. I could buy the idea that the kid has developed a small robot that he uses to win cash in illegal, back alley robot fights, but what comes next strained my credulity. After Hiro's brother Tadashi saves him from a bunch of rough characters who have been engaging in robot fights on the streets, he takes him to the university where he attends, which specializes in advanced robotics. Since Hiro has a rebellious streak, he never got around to checking out the university, which is right up his alley. Oddly, to be accepted, academic performance is not considered, but rather the fledging thespian must develop a robotics project which impresses the faculty.

Hiro ends up developing a project involving 'microbots' which swarm together to form any structure imaginable. The whole idea of the university is to help the student create the next great technical innovation. Hiro, however, has already done it, so why does he have to attend a university to improve on his capabilities? Nonetheless, when he's offered the chance to sell out to tech guru Alistar Krei of the new rising tech company, Krei Tech, he goes with Professor Callaghan at the University.

'Big Hero Six' begins its march toward complete unpleasantness, when Hidashi dies in a fire at the university. Callaghan saves himself by encasing himself in a swarm of microbots during the fire. While at first Krei appears to be the villain, it soon becomes apparent that Callaghan becomes a much bigger antagonist. He blames Krei for the apparent death of his daughter during a failed teleportation experiment. Very conveniently, Callaghan uses Hiro's microbots to attempt to destroy Krei and his company.

Hiro attempts to stop Callaghan by enlisting the aid of Tadashi's last creation, Baymax, a robot that resembles the Pillsbury Dough Boy. Baymax has a computer chip that turns him into a kindly physician, who can both diagnose and treat virtually any illness. Hiro is also aided by Tadashi's team of student colleagues who morph into superheros with Hiro, replete with special costumes (a la 'The Avengers').

The last third of the picture involves tiresome battle sequences where the superhero team is pitted against Callaghan and the microbots. When the vengeful, obsessed professor is finally subdued, we're treated to the completely awkward discovery that his daughter was in stasis the whole time inside a worm hole, and is saved--only to see her idiotic father being hauled away by the police, and probably sent up the river for years due to his myopic thirst for revenge.

Hiro learns his 'lesson' after first switching Baymax's microchip, transforming him into a violent robot with enhanced karate skills, only to suddenly realize that he was echoing Professor Callaghan's proclivities toward vengefulness and realizing he needed to turn the robot back into a kindly, attending physician.

For aficionados of violent video games, a good deal of 'Big Hero Six' is for you. The painstaking animation goes all for naught when one discovers that the film is devoid of charm. Everyone and everything is obnoxious: from 'kick-ass' Hiro to Betamax, where the medical profession is put up on a pedestal. From brother Tadashi's death, to the most unpleasant Callaghan, who insanely attempts to 'get even' after an accident, this is a film that is hardly appropriate for children. If you must see it, do so for the excellent animation team--they, as opposed to the screenwriters, still have some integrity left.",1417305600,6,4126,5.09319526627219

6724754,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Disney decided to take their own crack at a Marvel comic, but instead of live-action they went with their non-Pixar animation department to make a full-length big budget movie. Even though the comics themselves have only really had about two mini-series, Disney went ahead and remade them in the more ""Americanized"" anime style similar to Teen Titans and Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Set in the fictional city of ""San Fransokyo"" which is some kind of Japanese-themed American metropolis, and young genius Hiro spends his time in underground mini-robot battles. His older brother Tadashi convinces him to instead attend the local nerd college, especially after meeting his quirky classmates. So Hiro creates a special swarm of microbots for the entrance exam/science fair that can unite to form any shape as thought be who is wearing a mental headband. But as typical in most Marvel stories, a fire breaks out in the lab during Hiro's presentation, and seemingly takes the life of Tadashi as well as his teacher, Professor Callaghan. After a bit of grieving, Hiro reactivates Tadashi's blow-up medical android he made just before he died by the name of Baymax which looks like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man merged with the Michelin Man. Hiro then discovers through one of his remaining microbots that a masked nameless villain is controlling an entire swarm of them, and has them poised to commit some major crimes. Barely escaping from the ""man in black"", Hiro brings together the rest of his future classmates from Tadashi's school to help him take down this masked menace. The team consists of the sentimental Wasabi who makes some laserblades for himself, Go Go and her giant-wheeled rollerskates, quirky Honey Lemon that uses a special purse that manufactures special orbs specifically suited for a variety of uses, and fanboy Fred who isn't a student at the school but rich pockets help supply the team with the gear they need as well as give him a special kaiju-themed mascot suit. The 6 track down the Amon-lookalike baddie, but his true identity possesses Hiro with wanting him bumped off instead of bringing him to justice. The rest of the movie has our heroes trying to stop the villain from carrying his deadly vengeance of deadly revenge, but comes to a satisfying conclusion. (P.S. Stay tuned for the post-credits bonus!)

The movie was directed by Chris Williams whose only main credit up until now was co-directing Bolt, but took a good enough hold on the production to produce an exceptionally good animated movie. There are parts that seem make Big Hero 6 like more of a Dreamworks film, but it fits well enough into the Disney warehouse. It might not appear like your typical Marvel movie, but the comic it's based on is outside the given regular comics continuity since the most of the X-Men related characters were left out. However, most generic comic geeks should appreciate it, especially if your a fan of The Incredibles!",1417132800,,2945,4.971602434077079
6724755,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Michael Turner was one of the greatest graphic novel creators ever to live, and it was a great tragedy when he died. 2 months before his death from terminal cancer I waited for hours in line hoping he would show up at the Wizard World Los Angeles, not because I wanted him to sign my comics (even though he did) but because I wanted to tell him something. I simply told him ""Thank you. Your work is the reason why I got into comics."" People were getting impatient with me for saying anything at all to him because of the hundreds of people in line, but I had to say it. I had to thank him. I used to call him the Walt Disney of modern comics and if you had read the Shrugged (which seems to have inspired Monsters Inc) and Soulfire (which HEAVILY inspired this film's world) you would understand why. While most people will probably remember him for his work drawing amazingly beautiful people, for his jaw-dropping comic covers, and perhaps for his masterpiece Fathom, I primarily will always remember him for his endless stream of amazing ideas and creative genius. It's a shame that more people failed to recognize it. This film is loaded with influences from all kinds of science fiction. You've got battling robots from Real Steel, powered body-suits from Bubblegum Crisis, and a super-hero team that seems like combination of The Incredibles and Stars and Stripes (Star Girl and her robot-suit-wearing-dad from the JSA). But what stuck in my mind as the credits rolled was something like...thank goodness someone still remembers Michael Turner and J. Scott Campbell (Wildsiderz). Seriously, read the parts of Soulfire completed before Turner's death. It's like the city in this film is that world breathed into life. This film may be based on a Marvel property, but it's Turner's work and classic anime that are the most obvious influences (to me anyway).

Apart from all that, this is arguably the first Disney animated film specifically designed to appeal to teens, and I can tell you that it succeeds spectacularly as a coming-of-age drama, a science-fiction/adventure, and yes, a super-hero film. The influences permeate everything about this film. It is so self-aware, so well-thought-out, that it skillfully calls attention to tropes, then averts them in smooth side-steps. The medical-robot-turned-reluctant-superhero is reminiscent of the robot from Robot and Frank. It knows what it was designed to do, and resists being changed into something else, but it's FEELINGS for its charge cause it do things that will make you smile, laugh, and cry.

Yes, this film has a lot of heart. It's well-paced, and entertaining. And the animation is absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. This and How to Train Your Dragon 2 are two very large leaps forward in American animation, because they are not cartoons, but animated films, designed not to please children, but to tell a story that teens and adults will find satisfying. They are mature not because of violence and sex, but because of intelligence and depth.

This is the first of the Disney animated films that I will be pre-ordering. It's that good. Long live great animated stories and long-live the memory of creative geniuses like Michael Turner who dreamed of a sunset-hued world of adventure.",1417046400,334,3255,4.946983546617916

6724757,3,B00O4ZC57I,"This is a cute movie that I'm almost entirely indifferent to. It's a kid's movie. I know that because nothing has time to develop naturally. There's more plot in the first half-hour than in all of Up. That 'walking-through-the-tropics-towing-a-house' scene could never have happened here; anything static would risk causing little minds to wander.

It's not that I mind plot. Finding Nemo had plenty of it. This plot, though, is terribly trite, and almost all of the dialogue exists only to move it along. The gist of it is about like so:

There's a brilliant kid. We know he's brilliant because he can make any random thing he wants, a deus ex machina the film employs at least a half-dozen times. His older sibling would have a heart of gold if he wasn't made of cardboard. Naturally, that guy's fated to die, an event that won't traumatize anyone because the accelerated grieving process has the gravitas of a Shirley Temple closeup. Sidekicks appear and immediately shed their defining personality characteristics, whereupon we follow our genius as he slowly unravels a mystery that's like an open box wrapped in an open box inside an open box.

Oh, before I forget: big brother left behind a Michelin Man robot with antiseptic spray and an onboard air compressor. Watching this thing awkwardly toddle around is the highlight of the movie. The filmmakers don't embrace that vulnerability for long; he becomes a non-entity when the kid turns him into an X-Men sentinel with 40 minutes left to run, which then leeches the emotional impact from their subsequent bonding. There's a villain mucking about too, but I don't care and you won't either.

That's the sum of my take on this movie. It's just: blah. It'll entertain kids and you won't actively hate it (unless you're allergic to hollow attempts at emotional manipulation), but don't go in expecting it to tug your heart or tickle your intellect. If the trip isn't in service of a kid (and perhaps even if it is), I'd vote to stay in and rent Wall-E for a second go.",1416873600,6,2022,4.785100286532951
6724758,5,B00O4ZC57I,"***This review may contain spoilers***

Basically a fusion of ""Teen Titans"", ""The Incredibles"", and one of those `60s Japanese cartoons featuring a boy and his giant robot (""Gigantor"" comes to mind), Disney's Big Hero 6 (hereafter ""BH6"")  is a  large-scale, comic-book action extravaganza that is on a par with any other ""superhero"" movie. However, BH6 delivers far more than the usual slam-bang hero/villain battles.  The movie illustrates and celebrates ""geeky"" creative, scientific, and technological intelligence and its valuable contributions to society. It cherishes familial, fraternal, and even mechanical relationships and friendships.  BH6 also examines the unthinking, dangerous pursuit of violent vengeance. Most unexpectedly but reassuringly, the movie is spiritual and convinces us that even robots and machines have souls (in their case, chips).

First of all, BH6 shows that without purpose and guidance, even the greatest, genius intellect is wasted and useless.  Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is just that person.  Gifted in robotics but aimless and unfocused, Hiro is content merely in pitting his creations against other miniature robots in illegal, underground fights.  He usually wins, but is nearly apprehended in a police sting operation before his older brother Tadashi Hamada (voice of Daniel Henney) zips by on his motorbike to save him.  Equally technologically adept, Tadashi has constantly berated the 14-year old Hiro for wasting his life and has constantly urged him to apply to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology (SFIT), a scientific academy he attends.  Tadashi's proudest achievement is a medical, health-care robot named Baymax (voice of Scott Adsit), a 7-foot tall white walking balloon figure that looks a little like Bib the Michelin Man or a man-sized Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, and sounds like HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  At the beginning, Baymax's sole function is healing and taking care of people, namely Hiro, who initially isn't too crazy about Baymax's protectiveness toward him.

After a little hesitation, Hiro, who's already graduated high school, agrees to put on a demonstration before the SFIT scientific faculty to show his credentials.  His invention is microbots (nanobots) that work like computerized LEGO blocks that can instantly combine to form almost any object, animated or stationary, from buildings to huge moving hands.  A mechanical headband controls the microbots' movements. The demanding SFIT Robotics Department Head Professor Robert Callaghan (voice of James Cromwell) is impressed and urgers Hiro to apply.  Tadashi had already introduced Hiro to his off-beat, nerdy, but accomplished robotics classmates: GoGo Tomago (voice of Jamie Chung), a brusque, stern, electromagnetics expert and extreme bicyclist, Wasabi (voice of Damon Wayans, Jr) a muscular but somewhat fastidious and cautious laser expert, Honey Lemon (voice of Genesis Rodriguez), an extroverted but sweet-natured chemist, and Fred, a happy-go-lucky (and surprisingly well-off) Valley Dude type who is a comic-book and dinosaur fanatic (and SFITs reptile mascot).

Tadashi's friends and the SFIT curriculum finally persuade Hiro to apply.  However, the SFIT robotics lab is set afire with Professor Callaghan inside.  Tadashi rushes in to save him.  The lab explodes.  Hiro is overcome with grief at the loss of his brother and he again goes off-course.  Tadashi's friends, and the suspicion that Alistair Krei (voice of Alan Tudyk), the Krei industry magnate who unsuccessfully attempted to purchase Hiro's microbots, killed Callaghan AND stole Hiro's microbots, rouse Hiro to action.

However, in order to capture the Kabuki-masked villain, who is using the microbots to spread havoc in San Fransokyo, Hiro needs a super-powered team.  Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred have their respective agility/electromagnetic disk, laser, chemical potion, and fire-breathing abilities.  But someone extra is needed: Baymax.  Baymax has neither the body (though he can lift over 1,000 pounds) nor the programming for super crime fighting.  Hiro overcomes these formidable obstacles with carbon-steel armor and a ""fighter"" computer chip.  The ""Big Hero 6"" team is ready to kick some evil butt.  But the team has some serious hurdles.  First, they are still uncoordinated and unfamiliar with fighting.  Second, despite his upgrade, Baymax is still a pacifist healer at ""heart"".  Third, and most shockingly, Hiro's desire to avenge his brother threatens to unbalance and consume him.  Can the team overcome these obstacles to not only stop the villain, but uncover his true identity?

BH6 eventually answers these questions with both vibrant, eye-stunnig action and quiet, contemplative scenes that demonstrate that blunt, thoughtless force and vengeance is not only not enough to solve problems, it may exacerbate these problems and cause still others.  Planning, logic, and creative thinking must also be used.  Even power and brains combined may not be enough.  Compassion and caring, as embodied by Baymax, must also enter the mix to solve problems without losing your soul.  Speaking of souls, despite Hiro's lament that his brother is gone, Baymax continually reassures him that ""Tadashi is here"" and points to his torso video, showing Tadashi's trial-and-error process in creating Baymax. This comforts Hiro (and us) Also, when Baymax is called upon to sacrifice himself to save someone, we realize that all may not be lost, because, as mentioned before, robots and computers have chips for souls.  I think BH6's ultimate comforting message is that since souls and chips live forever, people and robots can never truly die.  Thanks for that inspiring reminder, Baymax, Hiro, and BH6.",1416873600,3,5729,5.540229885057471
6724759,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a brilliantly crafted emotional and action-packed adventure that will leave its audience hungry for more. It is an enchanting blend of Marvel and Disney, two brands that could not be further apart, yet surprisingly they fit perfectly together. The film is charming, inspiring and unforgettable in every way imaginable. It is a film that will be hard to forget, and will be cherished for many years to come.

Big Hero 6, based on the Marvel comic book of the same name, centers around a young boy named Hiro and a delightful robot named Baymax in the fictional futuristic city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo). After a series of tragic events, Hiro goes from a technology-obsessed boy to lost, lonely and confused. But everything changes when he meets Baymax, the inflatable robot built to serve as a healthcare companion, and he transforms from boy to hero in a matter of minutes. Soon Hiro, Baymax and a group of unlikely friends are catapulted into a wild and emotional adventure filled with impressive visuals and surprisingly intense voice acting.

Big Hero 6, helms striking 3D computer animated graphics that were a result of two years of work by over 90 animators, and their work undoubtedly payed off. The animation looks better than anything Disney has done before, and at some points it was hard to tell it was even animated in the first place. The voice acting was done by a mostly unheard of cast, but they did it flawlessly. The characters are what made the film feel alive, and the chemistry between Baymax and Hiro brought laughs, joy and even tears. Throughout the entire film there was a bone-chilling emotion in the air that is rare among movies. There were even moments when crying could be heard throughout the theater. Big Hero 6 is unlike any animated film that has been made before, and a reminder that with a little bit of love, friendship and an inflatable robot, anything can happen.",1416787200,5,1950,4.766272189349112

6724763,2,B00O4ZC57I,"I was underwhelmed by this Disney superhero cartoon.  The plotting is predictable from first scene to the last.  Even though the main character is supposed to be a genius it seems to take forever for him to figure out why his microbots are still around after they were supposed to have been destroyed in a fire.  The characters and backgrounds have no flavor--each supporting character is given one defining trait and not developed any further and the animation seems very vanilla compared to recent releases The Boxtrolls and The Book of Life.  The robot has considerably less personality than the ones in The Iron Giant and Wall-E.  After Disney's recent winning streak with Tangled, Wreck It Ralph and Frozen it's hard not to be disappointed by this bland, completely by the numbers animated feature.

6724764,5,B00O4ZC57I,"First, I have to approve at least somewhat of any movie that promotes geek chic - and the good guys here are nerds at their nerdiest. Then, I found the first half touching, with two brothers bound by shared hardship and love of gadgetry. A bit over-the-top, maybe, but this is A) a cartoon, and B) a kid's power fantasy. A few moments really stand out, like that jaded cop when Hiro tries to report the villain, and Baymax's drunken ""low battery"" event. (For kids, it's safe goofiness, for most adults it's an amusing version of something that's happened to pretty much all of us, but anyone who is or cares for a diabetic might get a chill from the similarity to a low-sugar emergency.)

That power fantasy thing dials it up to eleven in the second half, where a day or two in the workshop transforms the raggedy band into superish-heroes. That one woman's purple super-miniskirt and super-purse struck me as a bit super-girly, but the other female character seemed to fit the theme better. There were a couple of big emotional scenes of predictable sorts, but most of it tended toward bloodless bam-pow excitement. And, if your kid is young enough, what's predictable to us won't be to her, so let her enjoy it.

You might have guessed by now that the kid is optional. Although kid-oriented, there's enough to keep a willing grown-up amused, too. So, if you want some safe, goofy fun, go ahead, let it amuse you. There are lots worse out there.

6724765,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Big Hero 6""

1. This is the most pleasant surprise I've seen at the movies in 2014. From the cutesy trailer and the stupid title, it's like Disney doesn't want anybody to know what the movie really is.

2. It's about a 14-year-old genius named Hiro Hamada who lives in the city of San Fransokyo. He's out of high school, bored, and thinks college is for nerds. He spends his time in the city's battle robot underground. Hiro's older brother, Tadashi, is a robotics engineering student who has invented a new kind of robot named Baymax that specializes in health care.

3. After some bad things happen, Hiro reluctantly teams up with Baymax and Tadashi's friends to stop someone from stealing Hiro's own invention of swarming microbots. But that quest opens up bigger problems.

4. There are themes of death and loneliness in the film that aren't obvious from the way the movie is marketed. I was more emotionally invested in the movie than I expected to be.

5. The filmmakers consulted about six universities and robotics research labs for help on this movie. I'm pretty sure this is the only animated film I've ever seen that uses the term ""tungsten carbide"".

6. The character of Baymax was inspired by actual research in a new field called ""soft robotics"". And the swarming microbots in the film are also based on real research and inventions. Of course, the movie takes those ideas and then leaves reality behind.

7. The animation in this film is so incredibly detailed that some scenes look almost like real life. The 3D is also worth the extra price, if you like that sort of thing.

8. The movie unabashedly promotes science, technology, engineering, and education. It makes the point that some problems are too tough to solve through brute force; sometimes you have to think your way to a solution.

9. If you are expecting an ""aww, that's cute and funny"" superhero movie, then you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is a fun movie for the family, but it's also a real movie with real issues, emotions, and problems. It's the most thoughtfully fun animated film I've seen in a long time.",1416096000,922,2138,4.695187165775401
6724766,5,B00O4ZC57I,"""Big Hero 6"" is a fun Disney movie with good animation and a surprisingly complex plot. In a futuristic San Francisco, a tech-whiz teenager named Hiro Hamada wastes his considerable talent hustling at back alley robot tournaments. His brother Tadeshi tries to set him on a different path by taking him to his university robotics lab. Hiro meets Tadeshi's diverse fellow students, and is introduced to Baymax, his brother's robotic personal health assistant. Hiro is inspired to do his own inventing, coming up with a new mini-bot that gets him invited to attend the university. However, in a mysterious explosion, Tadeshi is killed and Hiro's invention is destroyed.

All is not as it seems. Thanks to Baymax, Hiro discovers that his brother was murdered and that the killer has exploited his mini-bot invention. Hiro will leverage Baymax and the skills of his brother's fellow students to seek justice against the killer. The movie takes a superhero turn, and the action becomes quite dramatic, but there is a moral to the story and a very worthwhile ending. The action is a bit intense for very young children, but there is also lots of humor embedded in the characters and the storyline. The audience this reviewer saw the movie with laughed out loud at some of the sight gags, and clapped at the ending. Recommended as good entertainment.",1416009600,,1342,4.938053097345133

The visuals in the animation take the storytelling to new unexpected heights. The story inspires young minds to excel in academia for the correct pursuits and correctly casts a contrasting light on the wrong pursuits.  The lead character starts to make a wrong choice, but with the support of his friends, in the end he makes the right choice with a good unexpected twist.  So from both an entertainment and a virtues lesson perspective, this movie is exceptional; can't wait to buy the DVD.  Bonus: The movie starts out with an adorable short, so don't arrive late, its not to be missed!!!

6724770,4,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a movie that intrigues me on a lot of levels. It ought to have everything going for it.

It's based on a Marvel property (which I didn't even realize until I was seeing the movie (I can't say what gave it away (okay, I could, but that would be a spoiler))). That said, it's based on a Marvel property that I'm not actually familiar with so this is the rare adaptation (from a comic book) that I can see without having a picture in my mind of how it ought to be. Of course, I looked up the comic when I got home, and the path of adaptation they chose for this one is really interesting.

The comic is loosely set in the X-Men side of Marvel so has the full spectrum of mutants and all of that. The movie has removed everything that isn't technology based or transformed those things into something that is technology based. Basically, they made Big Hero fit into a slightly futuristic world in which people are still just people. And they did a really good job of it, too.

The movie does a great job with the exposition of the story. It's so typical of movies these days to just skip the exposition entirely, so I really appreciate it when a film takes the time to provide a foundation for the story they want to tell. Without having a way to check the timing on the movie, I'm going to guess the first half hour or so is all exposition. Let me re-say what I just said before: I like that!

Visually, the movie is incredible. Not just that it has great animation, but it has a great style. Actually, it looks a lot like The Incredibles, but that's not surprising considering that John Lasseter produced the movie.

Plus, it has the best drunken robot scene ever. Okay, that may not be surprising since it's probably the only drunken robot scene ever, but, still, it's hilarious.

The voice acting is adequate. There's nothing there to make any of it stand out except, maybe, for Scott Adsit, but it's hard to tell how much of that is him and how much is manipulation of his voice to make it work for Baymax.

The villain has a really cool look. That's all I'm saying about that. I mean, I'd be freaked out to have someone like that coming after me.

And the side characters work, too.

It has all the ingredients it needs for me to love it.

But I didn't.

Don't get me wrong; I really liked it; I just didn't love it. And I can't really tell you why other than that I saw the movie playing out the way it was going to go well before it got there. However, that was an interesting experience in-and-of itself, because my kids made the logic jumps the movie wanted them to make so that they would be surprised by what was actually going on when it was revealed at the end. I had to bite my tongue not to spoil it for them. For instance, at one point, my son said something about who the bad guy was, and I almost said, ""No, that's not who it is,"" but I managed to catch myself.

I'm not really sure if that was the problem or not. It might also have been that the main emotional punch of the movie happens toward the beginning, so I had no catharsis at the end.

Really, it's not that important. It's a really good movie. It's great, even. It's just not excellent. It's not a movie I left the theater wanting to see again, which, for me, is the hallmark of an excellent film.

The short film at the beginning, though, that was awesome, and I'd love to see that again.",1415750400,59,3380,4.22015503875969
6724771,4,B00O4ZC57I,"It's been said many times, and even mocked by Saturday Night Live, that Marvel can basically turn anything into a box office smash. The top-grossing movie of the year is Guardians of the Galaxy, for chrissakes, based on a comic book practically nobody read and less had heard of.  When Marvel and Disney essentially merged, it brought on a new challenge in territory that had yet to be conquered: animation. Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated feature based on a Marvel property, and it's both the strangest choice and the perfect one. Blending super-powered heroics with kid-friendly action and an ethnically-diverse cast, Big Hero 6 has something for everybody to love.

Big Hero 6 is based on a super obscure manga-influenced miniseries from years ago; so obscure it makes the Guardians of the Galaxy look like the X-men. While Disney has made some significant changes in the transition to the screen, honoring its Japanese roots certainly hasn't been lost. Shedding the typical Disney homogenization and honoring a merger of many different cultures, it's safe to say this is one of the best looking Disney animated films ever made, certainly unlike anything in their vast catalog of classics. Set in San Fransokyo, a futuristic combination of San Francisco and Tokyo, a gorgeous blend of new and old world charms, the story centers on robotics genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) and his equally brainy older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Orphaned at a young age, the two now live with their eager aunt (Maya Rudolph), using their intellect in very different ways. While Tadashi studies at a prestigious university, Hiro builds robots and earns money fighting them in underground tournaments. Sensing his little bro may be on the wrong path, Tadashi brings him to the school where Hiro is blown away by the awesome stuff being built by the other geeks: the spunky racer Go-Go (Jamie Chung) Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr) the laser enthusiast; Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) is a chemistry expert; and Fred (TJ Miller) is basically Shaggy minus his Scooby-Doo companion.

The character that is sure to become a phenomenon in his own right is the lovable, cherubic Baymax (Scott Adsit). Basically a giant stuffed balloon robot, Baymax is pretty much impossible to resist. Designed by Tadashi as a nurse robot, Baymax is clumsy, lumbering, and helpful to a fault. When tragedy strikes the university and Tadashi is killed, he becomes an outlet for Hiro's grief and a willing companion. Somebody out there caused the explosion that got Tadashi killed, its up to Hiro, Baymax, and his newly souped-up nerd pals to uncover the truth.  Basically, Big Hero 6 is a classic superhero origin story, one alive with energy, humor, and even a few dark turns. It actually works best as Hiro and his pals are hanging out, joking, and using their intellect to design their wondrous powers, and it's so much fun that we almost forget there's a bad guy out there to be caught.

While there are plenty of laughs to be found, mostly through the constantly-bumbling Baymax, there's also a serious journey of self-discovery that Hiro must endure. Learning to cope with loss, making new friends, and using his genius for good are all lessons Hiro must learn, but there are plenty more that the story merely touches upon. In fact there are too many messages the screenplay wants to get across, throwing them at us a mile a minute. It's a distraction from what we truly want to see more of and that's the relationship between Hiro and Baymax. Threatening for a while to become a pet/master situation, Baymax's ever-present connection to Tadashi becomes an emotional touchstone, one that never fades away through the robot's silly antics. As a healing robot it's his programming to help Hiro through his brother's death, but in a way he becomes a surrogate sibling. Its touching stuff, some of the most emotional Disney has ever dared in a film geared at young audiences. I dare you not to shed a tear when Baymax asks if Hiro is satisfied with his care.

Directed by Don Hall, who gave us the excellent Winnie the Pooh a couple of years ago, and Chris Williams (Bolt), Big Hero 6 looks amazing. A merging of Eastern and Western influences, San Fransokyo is both fascinating and a little bit scary, with new wondrous discoveries to be made around every corner. When Baymax gets his new winged battle armor, he and Hiro embark on a soaring test flight that actually surpasses anything we saw in How to Train Your Dragon. Unfortunately, his new armor also signals a turn away from the character work that was so enjoyable and an emphasis on standard superhero action. There's nothing technically wrong with any of it, but nor is it especially inspired. We just really want to watch Baymax try to squeeze his fat body in and out of tight spaces, or patch up holes with duct tape, or learn how to fist bump. Can we get more of that please? No seriously, can we get more of Big Hero 6? There's so much to adore here that a sequel is an absolute must.  It's another big victory for Disney and Marvel, and to think this is just scratching the surface of their potential. Yes, Big Hero 6, I am more than satisfied with my care.",1415664000,14,5195,4.791294642857143

6724776,5,B00O4ZC57I,"Big Hero 6 is a lot of things in one, which makes a lot of sense since the main characters (Hiro and Baymax) are also a lot of things in one. The movie is a great Sci-Fi flick, a MARVEL action movie, and a Disney film, and yes it meets the standards of each one.

As a science fiction movie, it uses science and technology as a centerpiece of the entire film, discovery and innovation not only start the entire movies events in motion, but help solve it, as the heroes discover new ways to use technology and science. This is NOT a Fantasy movie with robots as many Sci-Fi cartoons pretend to be, and I dare say that most of the technology and science is mostly rooted in near-future reality.

As a MARVEL movie, its perhaps slightly lacking, but thats to be expected to appeal to a wider audience of children and adult. Even by being one of the most adult PG movies Ive ever seen, it doesnt have the edge that the PG13 Marvel movies have, but yet barely loses a step because of it. With more emotional depth than other films like Iron Man and Captain America, and a more reasonable and logical explanation for suddenly being able to fight badguys, it certainly does a great job at filling the role as a Superhero movie, including a fun and surprising link back to the world of Marvel comic books (Stay to the end after the credits) even WITHOUT a link back to the rest of the MARVEL/Disney world. Its safe to say they are in entirely different universes, something that could be considered a positive or a negative.

As a Disney movie, it excels. It IS First and Foremost a Disney movie above being a Sci-Fi or MARVEL movie, and the hallmarks of that show. Like many Disney films gone are the parents of Hiro and Tadashi (who had more screentime than I thought from the trailers, thankfully) who are being raised by their aunt, and while another loss strikes Hiro deeply, we are seen once again how this loss can cause emotional struggle and eventually growth, something Disney does so well as of late. Also, Disney is known for creating exceptionally cute, extremely cuddly and especially collectible characters, and Baymax might be the ultimate of all three. A marshmallow-like figure that eventually puts on some shiny new armor, flies and kicks some ass might just be the creation of a Disney marketing scientist all its own, and even knowing that, its impossible not to inescapably fall in love. He soars above even the cuteness of Wall-E and the baddassery of Eve, with a fistbump catchphrase that will have kids and adults quoting and laughing for days and weeks after the film. Drunk, (or rather low battery) Baymax is one of the funniest Disney sequences ever, and done impressively well to incite laughter from all ages in the audience. Everyone I attended with wished for more of that sequence.

Visually, its just as impressive as any recent animated film on par with Frozens high-quality animation, with much darker imagery than is shown in the trailer, contrasted with high-flying action fare, all framed in the perfectly blended city of San Franyoko. While I worried a bit that this city would be a whitewashed or culturally appropriated Japanese city, my worries disappeared in the melting pot of these two cultures. By using an American city that has its own strong imagery and culture, the creators avoided any confusion on this point, with trolleys and a japanese-infused Golden Gate bridge looking great along side colorful Japanese worded billboards.

This also played well into the amalgamation of characters who seemed not be of any specific race, and did this without disrespecting any that did exist. The only real danger here being Gogo being a traditional asian-girl-that-kicks-ass (and the typical color streak in her hair) but avoided all the other tropes that wouldve sent her down to stereotypical levels (such as a school girl outfit or a kawaii-giggle). Her catchphrase of woman up shows her as being an independant woman, and bookended by the decidedly Disney Princess-like Honey Lemon (who was a fun combination of Annas goofy nature, Rapunzels overly-excited attitude and a dash of Tony Stark level genius). The other two characters that rounded out the 6 were Wasabi (again avoiding any stereotypes here by making the most physically strong character in the group a neat-freak who hilariously was also the most nervous among the group) and Fred, the comic-book reading loveably lazy school mascot whose foreshadowing sets up the second half nicely while also acting as a funny break to some of the darker and action-packed scenes.

Combine all these elements together and you have one great movie, one that touches us all with its themes of loss and growth, both in an emotional sense and with the science involved. Not lost on this parent were the way these characters were not perfect as heroes, how they had to try and try again to get something right, and even after the atypical Superhero training montage, they learn themselves and look at things in a different perspective to survive and win. There is a darker moment with the main character Hiro, who is seeking revenge above justice, that left the theater breathless, as it was shockingly powerful. Here is a character who has already dealt with loss, but as this movie shows, that does NOT mean that they can handle it again, or in the right way. It is a stark reminder that every loss is a powerful loss, and that we sometimes cannot control the way we feel. The trope that those lost remain with us are put to the test by Hiro, a much more complicated character than was needed for this movie to work, and this complication and his growth is what elevates this movie emotionally to sit among the best that Disney has to offer.",1415577600,5,5726,4.732464929859719

6724778,5,B00O4ZC57I,"This was a phenomenal movie.  The main characters battle with loss, grief, revenge, friendship, and forgiveness.  Teaches the value of trying to understand a different perspective on a similar situation and how a change of heart can help the healing process.  Definitely one the whole family will enjoy.  There are scenes that will make you cry but you will laugh through a lot of it as well.  Will be adding this to my home video library as soon as it is released.  Can hardly wait to watch it again.  I highly recommend it.",1415491200,5,525,4.580645161290323
