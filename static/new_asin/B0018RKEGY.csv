3420855,5,B0018RKEGY,The instrument fairies are really cute and teach a nice variety of instrument types.  My 2.5 year old granddaughter is delited with this video.  She talks alot about Big Jet taking Grandma Rocket's soup and loves to tell the story.  Great quality and highly recommended.,1230336000,,270,4.955555555555556
3420856,4,B0018RKEGY,My 3yo enjoys this DVD.  It's good classic LE.  Some of the music is reused from another one of their DVD's which is disappointing as there is so much great classical music about.,1229558400,,179,4.393939393939394
3420857,5,B0018RKEGY,"I remember tuning into Little Einsteins when my daughter was a little younger than 1 and thinking, I can't wait for her to mock the movements that they do repetetively on the show!! Well my now 18 month old is THRILLED when the show comes on. She hears 2 notes of the beginning music and drops what she is doing and flies over to the TV and starts patting her legs and saying ""pat, pat, pat"" and then begins dancing and screaming with excitement!! My husband and I LOVE her enthusiasm about the show. And what's more, we LOVE it too!! It's actually an educational program, that is fun and entertaining for not only our daughter, but for us too! I often times find myself at work humming the tune!! It's a great show and a wonderful educational tool. And the excitement my daughter feels, that spills over to my husband and I is priceless!! Highly recommended!!",1227225600,2,860,4.484076433121019
3420858,5,B0018RKEGY,"My kids love the Little Einsteins. If your kids love the Little Einsteins, they'll love this. I get the DVDs for in the car and on demand (as in my kids demand them) viewing. All of the LE DVDs have a ""play all"" option which gives you about an hour or so of viewing time--perfect for the car ride to the grandparents.",1226361600,,317,4.129032258064516
3420859,5,B0018RKEGY,Another great Little Einsteins DVD.  What's not to love about these smart kids who travel the world?! My 3 1/2 year old adores all the Little Einstein DVDs.,1221523200,,156,4.571428571428571
3420860,2,B0018RKEGY,"My 3 year old son loves Little Einsteins and watches the show every weekend, so we were kind of disappointed to find that most of the episodes on this DVD are reruns of the TV show.  Only ""The Flight of the Instrument Fairies"" is new.  You could simply record the other episodes for free (which we had already done!)",1220745600,5,316,4.338983050847458
3420861,5,B0018RKEGY,"My 22 month old son is a huge Little Einsteins fan, and so of course we had to get him the Flight of the Instrument Fairies DVD.  Included on this DVD are 4 episodes, including the never before shown on television (yet...LOL) Flight of the Instrument Fairies.  The other three episodes have been shown on Playhouse Disney several times, but all have a fairy tail theme - The Glass Slipper Ball, Little Red Rockethood, and The Puppet Princess.  Since my son watches episodes over and over it doesn't bother us that there are episodes we've seen before, plus it saves us room on the DVR!",1219449600,51,585,4.552380952380952

3420906,5,B0018RKEGY,Educational and entertaining. These videos tend to play classical music and have artists renditions of paintings involved in some of the videos. My daughter is a teacher and is quite choosy what she will allow her 2 year old to view. This along with Daniel The Tiger and Dora videos are just about all she will play in the home.,1455840000,,328,4.483333333333333
3420907,5,B0018RKEGY,"As annoying as I find this show sometimes, it's one of the few things I'll let my 11 month daughter watch. It's educational, and she loves the music. I love that they use classical music and real life art pieces as well. She's even learned the body movements they teach. We try to limit her screen time as much as possible, but when we do let her watch television, we like it to be educational. So this was a great pick for us!",1455840000,,427,4.156626506024097

3420925,5,B0018RKEGY,"Endless fun, one of my all time favorite children's cartoons. I love how the creators get little ones so involved in learning about instruments and famous composers. It's nice to see children learn important information about the Arts. Nothing makes me happier than watching my 2 year old twin Granddaughters pat their knees and say ""Pat, Pat, Pat"" along with the cartoon. They just love it and it's amazing to watch them learn and follow along with such a great cartoon. Totally recommend!!!",1445212800,,492,4.9397590361445785

As for this particular DVD, she liked the lesson that even the smallest, you can help the most.
