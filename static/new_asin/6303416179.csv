639297,5,6303416179,"Joe of Maryland is wrong.  This IS the second set from the Masterpiece theatre running in the late 70's of this epic story.  As one who saw it then, and relived it through the videos today, I highly reccomend it to  anyone interested in the England of the late 18th century.",956016000,17,274,4.333333333333333
639298,5,6303416179,"After having viewed the original Poldark on PBS and then, again, thru home video, I found myself eager to follow the cast thru their love, their  betrayals, George Warleggans relentless pursuit to destroy Ross Poldark and  the various new plots that would invariably present themselves in Poldark  2.  I am tremendously saddened that the series is over and no new episodes  were made. I truly crave this story line.
Excellent Storyline Excellent  Characters Excellent Scenic Excellent Costumes",929664000,6,493,5.337662337662338
639299,5,6303416179,"Ross Poldark returns from America and the in the Revolutionary war to find his fiance preparing to marry his cousin, his estate in ruins, and his father dead. When he adopts a thirteen year old street ruffian housemaid,  he is unaware of how she will further disrupt the life he is trying to  rebuild, or that she may muture to be more than a maid. The video is filled  with authentic Cornish coast scenery and venacular, a love story that holds  true to human nature rather than a script. Although the movie was originally  shown in the seventies, because it is a period piece it still holds its own  today.",926812800,3,608,4.4818181818181815

7845665,5,6303416179,Loved this series.  Thanks for offering the set for Poldark series 1 and 2.  Really enjoy watching the older version.  Videos were in great shape!,1444867200,,146,4.76

7845667,5,6303416179,the quality of the tapes was quite good and we love this story.  PBS/British dramatic soap at their finest.  the characters from the books come to life.  the stories follow the books very closely.,1356912000,,196,4.705882352941177
7845668,5,6303416179,"""Poldark"" was originally released on VHS tapes. Seems like it took a very long time for ""Poldark"" Series 1 (DVD) to FINALLY become available. Then it was over a year before ""Poldark"" series 2 (DVD) could be had. Now, how long will it be before the rest of Winston Graham's ""Poldark"" is available for those of us not living in Europe? It's not as if the movies are being created and filmed, they are being copied. Does anyone know the real reason for this stingy/frustrating 'release' schedule? Maybe it's simply a clone of the corporate America marketing model= 'follow the money' ?",1293580800,,582,4.715686274509804
7845669,4,6303416179,"Story takes place in Cornwall and the scenery and constumes during the times of the French Revolution and the closing of the copper and tin mines are breathtaking.  There are stories within stories of ruling families and families striving to become so.  The resulting famine and suffering of the cornish people and their struggles to survive (smuggleing, etc.) are shown.  The lead, Ross Poldark plays his part extremely well. There are, however, some characters who are such hams that they should have been reined in by the director early on.  I enjoyed it.",1281312000,,558,4.967741935483871
7845670,5,6303416179,"This was one of the most popular series on Masterpiece Theatre. Why Why is the studio not bringing this out on DVD. The videos are available, but are very expensive. The first Masterpiece series, The First Churchills is out on DVD I love that one, why not this one. Please everybody type in your information to Amazon to be contacted when the DVD's are out. Amazon states this is a vote for the product. We can let the studio know we Want ALL OF BOTH Poldark series out on DVD ASAP.",1202688000,,482,4.3076923076923075
7845671,5,6303416179,"Those of you who have already seen the first set of six tapes need no introduction to this wonderful Masterpiece Theatre series. In existence for  over a quarter of a century, time has not diminished the capacity of this series to entertain. This is simply a first rate period piece, set in late eighteenth century Cornwall. It focuses on Ross Poldark, scion of a well known Cornish family and a member of the established gentry,  and his wife, the base born Demelza. Be prepared to be glued to your television for the twelve hours it takes for this six video boxed set to tell their mesmerizing story.
Poldark's rival and arch enemy, George Warleggan,  is now married to Poldark's childhood sweetheart Elizabeth, widow of Poldark's first cousin, Francis.  Warleggan will stop at nothing to ensure the continued ascendancy of the house of Warleggan and the destruction of the Poldarks. Family ties that bind both may serve to join their houses, but George Warleggan intervenes cruelly, consigning others to years of unhappiness. Meanwhile, politics also plays its part, and Ross Poldark and George Warleggan find themselves battling for political power.
Meanwhile, Poldark's good friend, Dr. Enys, marries Caroline, the woman of his dreams, a beautiful and gloriously rich heiress. Ross and Elizabeth have a fateful meeting, one that threatens the sanctity of his home with Demelza  and fuels George Warleggan's insecurities over his wife's affections, as well as his hatred of Ross Poldark. Of course, Demelza has had enough of Poldark's mooning over the icy Elizabeth, and when a young naval officer sweeps her off his feet, Demelza's resistance is at an all time low.
As the eighteenth century comes to a close, the Poldarks and the Warleggans have undergone many changes and weathered many adversities. Ross Poldark continues to be a proud and stalwart man, bemused by his newly realized love for his feisty wife, Demelza. George Warleggan, alone and embittered by finding out too late what he should have known all along, has yet to put an end to the rivalry that has fueled so much hatred and enmity. The trials and tribulations of these two competing dynasties will have the viewer riveted to the screen.
Robin Ellis as Ross Poldark, Angharad Rees as Demelza,  Jill Townsend as Elizabeth, and Robert Bates as George Warleggan are superlative in their respective roles. Judy Geeson is magnificent as the independent heiress, Caroline. Unfortunately, Dr. Enys is no longer played by the charismatic Richard Morant. Instead, Michael Cadman takes over the role and, while competent, is not as romantically charismatic as his predecessor. Eileen Way also gives a very notable performance as Poldark's elderly Aunt Agatha. Kevin McNally gives a very moving performance as Demelza's brother Drake, whose romance with Morwenna, Elizabeth Warleggan's cousin, is star crossed due to the interference of George Warleggan. The rest of the supporting cast is, likewise, top notch.
This second set of six videos is every bit as captivating as the first set of six, leaving the viewer wanting more. Bravo!",1050969600,50,3097,5.122772277227723
7845672,5,6303416179,"Poldark 2 continues the story of Ross, Demelza, Elizabeth, and George through the next three volumes of Winston Graham's series set in eighteenth century Cornwall.  We continue to see the tension, both personally and in business, between Ross Poldark and his nemesis George Warleggan.  Several very appealing characters join the cast, most notably Morwenna Chynoweth, cousin of Elizabeth who falls in love with Demelza's younger brother Drake Carne.
This series is beautifully shot in Cornwall and, even though it is over twenty five years old, still holds up well.  This series ends tragically, with little room left for more sequels.  That's a pity, because Graham continued his Poldark saga well into the nineteenth century, focussing on the next generations of Poldarks and Warleggans.  Maybe someday we can see Poldark 3!",1032739200,15,826,5.323076923076923
7845673,5,6303416179,"As good today as it was all those many years ago. It's a love story, drama, and adventure all rolled into one. A really great portrayal of the late 1700's. Wonderful acting, great costumes and the scenery of the Cornish coast is spectacular. If you missed it the first time around, don't miss the opportunity to own these videos. Oh, and Joe was wrong in his review, part II is just that...part II of the the original Poldark, not a repeat.",1014163200,6,440,4.444444444444445
