7884321,4,630518318X,I was surprised actually how well made this movie was. Fast paced action in space. This was a fun exciting movie.,1414627200,,113,4.428571428571429
7884322,4,630518318X,"This movie starts out a little self-consciously with some gratuitous violence and T&A.  But it soon hits its campy stride.  With Matt Frewer (LawnmowerMan 2) thoroughly enjoying his campy-evil bad guy role as Max Durbin,
""Durbin, you're not God.""
""Yes, I know I'm not God...(sly smile)...not yet.""
C. Thomas Howell is hilarious as the billard cue wielding particle physicist, ""Go ahead, ask me about any particle!""
All these characters are aboard a Cryogenic Transport in orbit above an ecologically devastated earth.  There is a plan involving the Hubble and a solar flare to fix the Earth (don't ask).
This movie was fun to watch, I recommend it to open-minded Sci-Fi fans.",1031961600,15,675,5.063063063063063
