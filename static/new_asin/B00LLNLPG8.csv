8666388,5,B00LLNLPG8,"An excellent companion to the first 2 volumes by Maestro Martinez.  I like the continuation of the footwork presented here. If you have the first two DVD's in this series, I would highly recommend this one as well.",1530835200,,214,4.631578947368421
8666389,5,B00LLNLPG8,"These DVDs are a great source of information for those looking to learn more about the Spanish school of fencing. While no one can learn a martial art by simply reading a book (old or new) or by watching a DVD, this is a fantastic addition to anyone's collection of study materials and offers those without access to a qualified teacher the chance to begin their journey.

Based on many years of rigorous research by Maestro Martinez, the steward of a living martial arts tradition, he has put his unique combination of knowledge on the fencing arts and his fluency in many Spanish dialects on display. Given this, he remains the single most qualified person to offer an interpretation on La Verdadera Destreza and does so eloquently in this series",1530835200,5,748,4.753846153846154
8666390,5,B00LLNLPG8,"If you are looking for an introduction to, or to hone your skills in, the historical style of Spanish fencing known as La Verdadera Destreza, then you can do no better than to personally train with Maestro Ramon Martinez, or with one of the instructors who has been trained by him to teach this system. Live instruction is always preferable to a book or video. If that, however, is not possible, then the NEXT best thing you can do is to train using this DVD, ""La Verdadera Destreza: The True Art and Skill of Spanish Swordsmanship."" Maestro Martinez has an extensive background in traditional fencing (he studied under one of the last traditional masters who taught the old methods: Frederick Rohdes, a German born in 1897, who passed away in New York City in 1984). Along with many other systems, Maestro Martinez actually learned a traditional mixed doctrine system of rapier and dagger (as well as single dagger) from his teacher, that had been passed down to him by his own master. Since that time, he has devoted nearly four decades to the study, practice and teaching of historical fencing, and has specifically devoted over a quarter of a century to the research, reconstruction and resurrection of Spanish rapier fencing (Destreza). My own experience training under Maestro Martinez commenced in 2005. Previously, I had studied Krav Maga under an ex-Israeli special forces instructor (and former personal student of the founder of Krav Maga), western boxing at the Harlem Police Athletic League in New York City, and Arnis stick fighting under an indigenous master while I was living in the Philippines. I had great respect and admiration for all of these instructors. And yet, I somehow felt unfulfilled in these martial arts. What, exactly, was missing, I did not know. But I was fairly certain that I would recognize it when I saw it. And see it I did, when I finally visited the Martinez Academy in 2005. At that time, what I saw so impressed me that I decided to leave off my other martial arts and devote my training time 100% to the study of traditional fencing under Maestro Martinez. Since then, I have seen a lot of fencing in the world--whether under the banner of classical fencing, historical fencing, WMA, HEMA, etc.--at conventions, tournaments, online, and in person. Some was good, some was not so good. With specific regard to Spanish fencing, there is no one on earth that I am aware of, whom I would recommend over (or even remotely close to) Maestro Martinez. But, to paraphrase LeVar Burton from the show Reading Rainbow: ""You don't have to take my word for it."" Check out the DVDs, and make up your own mind. I don't believe you will be disappointed.",1530748800,5,2682,4.794816414686825
8666391,2,B00LLNLPG8,"I am a board-certified fencing master (2008), a researcher of the Spanish tradition, and I run a school which teaches the work based on the earlier authors of La Verdadera Destreza with an emphasis on Carranza, Pacheco, Figueiredo, and Ettenhard.

As I stated in the previous review of vol. 1 & 2, the first thing you should know about this DVD is printed on the back.  Ramon Martinez claims to be the ""world's preeminent authority"" for this tradition. If you have experience in martial arts, this should be a warning sign. Anyone making extraordinary claims deserves extra scrutiny and skepticism.

There is some good here but the entire presentation of vol. 3 is damaged by chaining it to the first 2 DVDs which are both a smoking hot mess.  It would have been far better to label this DVD vol. 1 and set the others aside as early work.  Its clear the work has improved but linking it to the previous DVDs forces Martinez into an untidy corner; anyone involved with his organization must pretend the previous DVDs are still correct.  That can create a sort of intellectual tension in which you must ignore the traditions source texts.

First, there isn't much here.  The DVD is about 54 minutes long so you are not going to see atajo, conclusion, any codified attacks, or generals.  Youre going to get right angle, footwork, and desvios which are then formed into time thrusts for counterattacks.  Thats fair since it is what the DVD promises but there just isn't much practical content for someone wanting to get started.

This DVD is organized into 2 sections; the first is an academic presentation about the right angle and the footwork.  The second is a practical series of demonstrations and exercises intended as a guide for the same two items.

**********************************
SECTION 1 - Academic Presentation
**********************************
This is actually pretty good and it is the best part of the DVD.  The video makes an argument for the right angle posture as a guard and for stately movement as opposed to modern athleticism.  These may be reasonable arguments but, even in the citations presented, it is clear that there is room for a counter-position.  (For example, Carranza says right angle posture is ""not essential"".)

Martinez highlights for criticism what he calls spasmatic movement, bobbing, and weaving.  His argument for stately movement is not as coherent which relies on a citation from Pacheco and then a collection of quotes from Viedma.  This is odd because it acts as if Pacheco and Viedma are standing side-by-side unified in the tradition and this is very much not the case.  Pacheco was the head fencing master in Spain and Viedma is a maverick within the tradition who irritated Pacheco.  Creating an argument by artificially aligning Pacheco and Viedma is odd.  Your argument could be right, but if it is you should be able to make a better case without mashing these two authors together.

As to athleticism, we can also observe in Grandeza (1600) that Pacheco, in the before tempo, attacks into an Italian porta di ferro stretta from MdP in a single step having no greater advantage than the time provided by the extended position of the right angle.  Pacheco expects his attack to threaten the adversary effectively such that he will draw a parry.  (He then eludes the parry and the play described progresses into a series of renewed attacks each taking advantage of the adversary's defensive actions.)  I would argue that you need to move very quickly to make that attack work and this kind of play is very athletic.

My suspicion is that both of these arguments (right angle as guard and stately footwork) are directed largely at the work of M. Alberto Bomprezzi and his school in Madrid which uses the right angle situationally and often uses a guard posture with the legs further apart and the weight lowered.  That's an interesting debate and I find myself more curious about the arguments than persuaded by them.

On my first viewing, having reached this point, I was feeling very positive about the work.  This portion of the DVD I strongly recommend to viewers because this kind of critical debate is the heart and soul of Destreza.

**********************************
SECTION 2 - Practical Fencing
**********************************
Part of what is baffling here is the large number of retroactive conversions (retcons) that take place which are required to hand-wave away some of the obvious problems with the first DVDs.  Martinez reveals to us a pedagogical strategy, I have chosen to teach the position of the hand as uas arriba as a pedagogical device.  The usage of the position is intended to teach the beginner student, and here I stress beginner, an awareness of the edges of his weapon's blade so that the student learns to always make contact and oppose the adversary's blade with edge-to-edge contact without asking them to rotate their hand.  It offers not only mechanical advantage but also provides the most tactile sensitivity, tacto.  After the student is sufficiently advanced, I stress usage of the position of uas adentro because by that time the student will have properly developed strength and suppleness in the hand and arm.""

The idea that this was always a beginners-only pedagogical tool is less than credible.  It is perfectly okay to find an error in interpretation, acknowledge the mistake, and move forward with better practice.  Thanks to the internet we know that Martinez and members of his school regularly fenced in the right angle with the fingernails up through at least 2011.  (He appears to be retconning faster than George Lucas putting together a special edition Blu-ray.)

He continues by explaining that the student will now rotate the hand for atajos and desvios and what we observe is a series of thrusts defeated by deflections both with the true and false edge while maintaining the point in presence [on target].  The problem here is that desvios are not one of the 3 defenses recommended by the source texts (right angle, atajo, conclusion).  Pacheco lists aggregation [engagement] and diversions [deflections\parries which are not atajos] as the 2 false defenses and these desvios with the point in line certainly fall into this false category.

As the DVDs progress the desvios move from parry-riposte into counterattacks by timethrust.  In 100 Conclusions Pacheco specifically warns against this type of play with desvios, , [desvios] are of notorious danger due to the power that one gives to the adversary with the methods that produce it, by means of the mixed movement, in order to form an attack with liberty of being able to execute it before they end and at the same time, without being concerned with defense, or doing it and remaining defended.

By abandoning the noble power of the natural movement [downward] which augments the atajo and sacrificing defense for offense by keeping the point in presence [mixed movement], the desvios used as counterattacks become notoriously dangerous.  This kind of change is typical in this family of DVDs, taught point-in-presence with deflections on both the true and false edge, it seems magically similar to classical French foil parries again.  There is no mention that the desvio is considered a false defense.

During the thrusts the hands are turned fingernails up.  The example attacks are directed at targets in the four lines ignoring the adversary's weapon and each time additional force is absorbed into the student's arm by lifting the hilt.  The problem here is that lifting the hand serves no purpose beyond forgiving the force of the hit and it further exposes the student's low line.

Likewise, turning the hand fingernails up during the thrust places the fencers hand in one of the extreme positions [fingernails up, fingernails down].  That compromises defense by forcing the student into larger movements if an immediate atajo is required.  By keeping your hand fingernails in (or close to it) the student will be much quicker when applying a sudden defense and this becomes more true when attempting to defeat an adversary that presents multiple feints.  That becomes a cringe-inducing example later when Kirby rotates the hand from fingernails up to fingernails down in order to laterally intercept a thrust while attempting his own timethrust.  Had he just kept his hand fingernails in, the atajo wouldnt have required any of that excessive rotation because he could subject opposing steel downwards by pointing into the attack.

As to the footwork, while Martinez demonstrates the lateral compass neither step demonstrated arrives with the heels in line.  That's odd because it isn't hard to do correctly, the heels in line is what we observe in the original diagrams, and you would expect the demonstration in a DVD to be particular about it.  It's still stranger because this is not a problem when he demonstrates the curved compass.  [SEE IMAGES]

The transversal compass is also weird because he does not pre-turn the foot toward the adversary but rather, arriving with his rear heel and turns the front toe towards the opponent at the end.  When you attack with a transversal, pre-turning to point the toe and knee into the line of the attack allows the joint to absorb force and it improves accuracy when placing a thrust because the body aligns in the direction of force.  Importantly, it is also what the texts tell us we should do.  [SEE IMAGE]

Ironically, later in the DVD Martinez echoes this advice, ""It's important that the lead foot is always facing in the direction of the lead arm.""  This is routinely ignored by the fencers in the demonstrations as the front toes are almost never pointed at the adversary.

""Admonitions that you should be aware of; never be double weighted and do not cross your feet.""  He says this twice so it must be important but the fencers demonstrating ignore this completely crossing their feet willy-nilly.

After the footwork section we see an example of coming into right angle on command.  Mostly, this works but, unfortunately, as soon as the drill is sped up, the right angle slips into something which is more correctly obtuse angle.  [SEE IMAGE]

Execution errors are part of the reality of fencing.  However, these errors contradict the express advice given within the DVD. In a fencing DVD you have only a limited bit of time to convey your information and cleaning up easy mistakes of this kind should be required.  I think these are obvious even to non-fencers and should have been caught by the editor because they become a series of self-inflicted wounds that compromise the material presented.

**********************************
FINAL THOUGHTS
**********************************
At the beginning of the DVD Martinez states, ""As I have stated in volume 1 this is my own didactic method.  The pedagogy and methodology of other schools of fencing cannot simple be superimposed over the Spanish school.  To that end I have developed my own pedagogy.  It has been and still is my conviction that La Verdadera Destreza can and should be taught using modern comprehensible language.""

Unfortunately, again were going to see a sort of hybrid sport-version of the tradition which relies on parries (or time thrusts) with the point in presence.  From the perspective of the True School this hybrid form is hyper-aggressive, sacrificing defensive necessity for opportunities to strike by counterattack.  It still looks remarkably like sport or classical French with Destreza window dressing.  Has he superimposed another tradition over the Spanish True school?  I would argue that he has and pedagogy becomes a sort of fig leaf to excuse his changes to the tradition.

The problem with changes of this kind are that an English-speaker with little or no access to the source texts has no way to verify the integrity of the presentation.  Whats presented here (and in the previous DVDs) is notably different from what is described in the books.

**********************************
TL;DR
**********************************
Some good, some bad.
The academic presentation is strong even if it wasn't persuasive to me.  (4-5 stars here)

The practical section is still pretty flawed with regards to the integrity of the tradition and some puzzling technical faults which should have been caught in editing.  None of this means that what he is teaching isn't effective or interesting.  Classical French fencing works great, but if you're looking for the Spanish True School you should be aware that the system presented here is compromised by unmarked changes, some of which the source authors specifically say are dangerous and contraindicated.  (1 star here)

Tying it as vol. 3 to the first 2 tragically flawed DVDs was a terrible idea.

8666392,5,B00LLNLPG8,"Okay, so for starters, I've been studying destreza for a good three years now. Ramon Martinez presents a great series for starting down the path of the system in the first two dvd's. He compiles information from Carranza, Pacheco, Thibault, Ettenhard, and de Rada for his interpretation, primarily using Thibault's circle for the major circle. This DVD is mostly for helping understand the source material for the information he gives in his lessons. The first half of the DVD is pretty much all the source material and its explanations. The second half, shows it put into play. If your interested in learning destreza, this is an excellent start and will give you good sources of information which you can then take and research further if you want. Its a beautiful method of fencing and the DVD's are well worth the purchase if you are interested in it.",1508716800,7,855,4.8231292517006805
