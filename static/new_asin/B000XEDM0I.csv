8228089,5,B000XEDM0I,"""Project Canada"" is a very strong travel documentary that gives a good glimpse of the various areas in Canada. ""Project Canada"" seems to be a creative labor love that was done by four American men (John, Tim, Dan, and Jake) that appreciate each other's friendship and trust each other to travel from the East Coast to the West Coast of Canada in the span of three months. The following are some of the exciting adventures that these man went on during their trip to Canada that is shown in the ""Project Canada"" dvd:

Newfoundland Norris Point: One of the most popular photography spots in the world.
St John's Newfoundland: The dvd documents that the population has at least 170,000 people, and one of the lowest crime rates in Canada.
Quebec City in Quebec: There is mention of this place being the heart of French Canada, and pop star Celine Dion's homeland.  It is stated that at least ninety percent of the population that live in this area speak French.
Toronto Ontario: Toronto is stated as a very diverse city that has one of the most multi-cultural cities in North America.
Calgary Alberta: Calgary Stampede: One of the biggest rodeos in the world, and is known to be an international event that draws people from various places. There is also a viewing of the nightclub called the ""Roadhouse"" that is mentioned as Calgary's #1 night club destination, and one of the hot spots of the Calgary Stampede.
Yellowknife Northwest Territories: There was a discussion of the long summer days, and there was a scene that showed the men outside in this area at 2:20 a.m. (very interesting to see that it was still light outside). This dvd provided a demonstration how this area is one to have long summer days (the ""midnight sun"" phenomena similiar to that of areas in Scandinavia). The Folk on the Rocks Music Festival was shown (a.k.a ""Free Spirit Festival"" of an eclectic blend of various musicians and music).
Vancouver British Columbia: There is a statement of this place being a beautiful oceanside city.
Kelowna British Columbia: Watersports are huge, and there is an exciting Duotone Arts Festival every year.
Squamish British Columbia: Squamish is known as the recreation capital of Canada, and is the host city for the Logger's Sports Show.
The men decide to bungee jump in Victoria, and it is stated that John was born in Winnipeg, and grew up in the states.

  There is more good footage shown in the dvd, but I had an urge to give a detailed and informative summary of the great scenes available in this ""Project Canada"" dvd.  This dvd is a great to own if you intend to at least visit Canada within the next year and/or you are interested in learning more about Canada.",1305331200,2,2681,4.717948717948718

8228096,5,B000XEDM0I,"This film was a blast. It's hilarious, and you really get to see a side of Canada that you'd probably never see otherwise. It's a great road-trip film, but you learn a thing or two at the same time. These guys do it all- nightlife, outdoors, concerts, festivals, a little bit of everything. Very well-done film.",1193616000,3,311,4.571428571428571
