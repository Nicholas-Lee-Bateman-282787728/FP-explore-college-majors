2825574,4,B000PMFRUQ,"This was a made for TV mini-series based on the Benchley book ""GREAT WHITE""... The book was MUCH better but the movie is still ""good junk""... Entertaining and just fun to watch... I liked it then when it first debuted and still like it now for fun... Glad it was finally released...",1216944000,23,282,4.4423076923076925
2825575,3,B000PMFRUQ,"I thought JAWS was one of the best movies of the 70's.
Which came from Peter Benchley's book JAWS which deals
with shark attacks that happened in 1916 off the coast
of New Jersey or thats where the idea came from.
This movie deals with a government project gone wrong,
Basically a creature that can go from sea to land & back again,
but it's half human half shark.
Which to me coming from Peter Benchley something went wrong,
this movie is stupid & very corny.
From JAWS to this movie Peter Benchley's creativity has
gone way down since JAWS!!
I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!",1198368000,,576,4.293577981651376
2825576,3,B000PMFRUQ,"Long before I saw this movie..I, being a fan of Peter Benchly's work, Read the book White Shark, which is what the movie Creature is based on. The book White Shark is one of my all time favorite books...but I was largely upset by Sci fi Channel's so called movie version of White Shark. They hardly retained any of the material that was in the book...they kept the island...the main character and his son...and the over all basis of what the creature was..but every thing else from the book was thrown aside..like in the book it wasn't the main character's exwife that comes to the island with the seals..its an entirly different female character...in the book you never even meet his ex wife..she is only mintioned by Max while talking with his father. Also in the book it was the Nazi's who performed the experiments that led to the creation of the creature...NOT the US Navy. By changing that ..they cut out my favorite character from the book...even though he was only in the book for a short time..he was still an intersting character. Also Max meets the island girl in a totally different way in the book...also in the book her character is deaf....the only real reason I gave this 3 stars is because the film's creature was pretty awesome looking. Pretty much how I had pictured it while reading the book. I know that sometimes when a book gets made into a movie some things from the book get left out, altered or completely rewritten...but too me all the things from the book that was changed in the movie shouldn't have been changed. I can only hope that someday some one will deciede to give the book White Shark a true transformation into movie form. I'm not sure if I'd ever buy this movie...but I most likely would watch it or rent it...then again..I might not.",1188086400,,1774,4.581761006289308
2825577,1,B000PMFRUQ,"Well what can i say? ,its too long and the the story is the only thing holding it together .
It just go's to show not all books should be made in to film. If you like a b movie with a week plot week pace and a acting content that is paper thin , go for it!. The best thing i can say is the cover art is cool. sorry",1187827200,,314,3.436619718309859
2825578,3,B000PMFRUQ,"I think this movie is about 3 hours long, it would have been far better at about 90 minutes.  Craig T. Nelson is a rather sanctimonious nature guy doing some sort of shark research on an abandoned military base out on an island.  His (ex?) wife Kim Cattrall comes to visit with their kid.  Local fishermen start having trouble with sharks and Nelson sanctimoniously criticizes them, blah blah blah.  There's a long dull subplot with the kid and his new-found friends on the island as they have occasional run-ins with the shark creature.  This eats up about a third of the movie.  There's also a mysterious guy who seems to be the local insane bum, but maybe he's got a secret?

Anyhow, lots of family crap, lots of nature guy sanctimony, marginally involving plot overall.  It would probably be far more enjoyable without the 75 minutes of commercials that the Sci-Fi Channel plays every time they broadcast it.  Creature is typical low budget looking shark dude type thing.  Tho only reason I'd buy this is that Kim Cattrall looks incredibly sexy throughout most of the movie.  They should put chapter stops on each scene she's in so viewers could skip the rest of this junk.",1187395200,4,1177,4.692682926829268
2825579,5,B000PMFRUQ,Just ordered my copy and looking forward to viewing. Just to see sexy man Craig T. Nelson!  I love the cover artwork.  Craig has a beautiful manly chest and the artwork displays it magnificently.  Thanks MGM for releasing and giving such a hot pic of Craig.,1185840000,4,257,4.543478260869565

2825621,5,B000PMFRUQ,"I liked this movie from the first time I saw it.  In my opinion it is much, much better
than Jaws.  I have played this movie over and over again and very soon I may
have to get another copy before they stop releasing it.",1405123200,,220,3.8666666666666667

2825624,3,B000PMFRUQ,"This seems as though it would have been a SyFy movie playing on Saturday afternoon or, better yet, Friday at Zero-Dark-Thirty.

Don't get me wrong, I love Benchley's books.  But some things are best left unfilmed.  Seeing the creature hack up it's lungs -- didn't we see that in Jurassic Park?? -- took the step from ""Geeze"" to ""You've got to be kidding"".

Craig T. Nelson did his best to keep the story afloat.  However, some pretty pathetic accents from supporting cast make this movie laughable.  Right, mon?

All in all, that was three hours of my life I'll never see again.  However, in the movie's defense, I have to say I intentionally watched it.  I could have chosen to knit navel lint into a hammock instead.",1396224000,2,718,4.590551181102362
2825625,3,B000PMFRUQ,"It's been a while since I watched this movie. This story comes from Peter Benchley-The author of Jaws. It's been a while since I have seen this movie. This is a Kim Cattrall movie that must have been shot just before she got her big break-through position of employment. This movie only offered part 1. I kind of hated that because, this movie had the feel of a 50's sci-fi without looking to cheap.
  The movie is about marine biologist working at a laboratory where something has gone wrong. What has gone wrong is the creation of a dangerous creature that appears to be amphibious in nature and also either really ticked off or possibly a man-eater.
I didn't get to see the the second part of Creature because it wasn't available. This movie is a B movie and might be even cult material, depending on the second part. I gave it a three because I need to see the second half which holds most of the action.",1391904000,2,908,4.398809523809524
2825626,4,B000PMFRUQ,"Amazon asked me to write my review here. I personally do not believe we should have to write so much, I believe we need to just give movies a star. Since they didn't ask me I guess I won't be rating any movies. We will see if this gets through",1389484800,,243,3.88
2825627,5,B000PMFRUQ,"Nelson has always been my favorite actor, so I admit I am pre-disposed to like anything he's in.  However Creature has enough of the thrill-factor moments that aficionados of the genre love, and enough of Craig's bare chest to please me.  There are also some stunning shots of ocean scenery that I enjoyed.",1388620800,,306,4.754716981132075
2825628,4,B000PMFRUQ,An interesteing twist of man fooling with nature theme. The concept is good but the  this time man messes with marine biology i search of a new type of weapon. Entrtaining.,1382659200,,172,4.548387096774194
2825629,5,B000PMFRUQ,"As I had mentioned on my review of The Beast, when i watched this movie on TV, I hoped it would come out on DVD and sure enough, it did.  Watching Craig T. Nelson go up against the main protagonist; he was fantastic.  And Kim Cattrell was fantastic as his wife who was always by his side to help him destroy this creature from killing more people.  The roles she has partaken lately don't do her justice and I would like to see her do more of this kind of movie than watching her frolic about in something like ""Sex and the City"".  Anyway, that's just my opinion; if she can't get cast in movies like this anymore, its too bad.",1368057600,,627,4.1570247933884295
2825630,3,B000PMFRUQ,"False start number 1: a strange mishmash of things to come, viewed behind the opening credits.

False start number 2: a flashback to the 70s and a ginormous underground 10 million dollar Naval complex where they are.....experimenting.  Of course, there are the experiments they want the Project Oversight Officer (Colm Feore) to see and one they do not.  That one (the BIG secret) escapes confinement, to be rescued by Lt. Thomas Peniston Werewolf (Giancarlo Esposito), who traps it in a cage that he then sinks into the ocean.

Actual start number 3: the present day, whatever that is, but figuring it's 25 years later, that creature must be at least a geezer and yet it's not, it's fresh as a daisy and raring to go.
Now comes the long part, as stories go, this one seems to go on forever.  The main character is Dr. Simon Chase (Craig T. Nelson), a single-minded researcher for a cure to cancer.  His excess baggage: an ex-wife, Dr. Amanda Macy (Kim Cattrall), and a son he rarely sees.  There's also the specter of a dead brother that spurs him onto finding a cure for cancer, no matter what the cost.  This makes him either heroic or incredible stupid.  What's the point in having a family if it's considered a distraction?  He is also a bit of a know-it-all and an insufferable crusader, not to mention a bit of a bully who always wants things his way.  The character is very easy to dislike.  Actually, there are a lot of characters designed that way: the spooky Admiral (Colm Feore), the local cop (Blu Makuma), the local poacher (Michael Reilly Burke), a nasty fisherman (John Aylward).  At times it's difficult getting past these irritants, to just take the story as it is.  When it's all about the CREATURE, it's fun and exciting.  When it's about sour people bitching and moaning, it turns into a bit of a drag.  One obstacle to combat would be reasonable, when they come at you from every quarter it feels contrived and manipulative.  If this was intended to make us feel sorry for the poor Chicken Little doctor, it failed miserably.  He fits right in with this group of malcontents, enough so to be their leader!  A more sympathetic actor might have made this work better.  Even so, the shark/creature is what makes this watchable.  That, and some of the sillier scenes, like the Spaghetti Western moment when they show close-ups of Craig T. Nelson's eyes then Sharky's eyes then his then Sharky....  All that was lacking, a harmonica and Jack Elam!

I'm keeping this one to watch again.",1313020800,2,2502,4.662100456621005
2825631,5,B000PMFRUQ,"I saw this movie on ""Sci Fi"" channel a few years ago. It's based on a novel called ""White Shark"" by Peter Benchley (of ""Jaws"" fame) but the movie wasn't as close to the book as I thought it would be. Still, the effects and story were very well done and the movie was interesting. There were moments that had me jumping and I would have chewed my nails down to the nubs if I still bit them. The creature in question is a genetic experiment (a hybrid of shark and human) and the design was very well done. You could believe that this was something you might run into. The acting was well done and I think this movie is a good addition to anyone's collection. (then again, I'm a horror film fanatic so I'm a little biased! ;)",1304812800,,722,4.164285714285715

2825633,1,B000PMFRUQ,"Are you old enough to remember the old SNL skit when Chevy Chase played the land shark?  Gilda Radner was always on the other side of the door, just naive enough to let the land shark in to bite her head off. This movie is an agonizing six hour continuation of that skit, but all of the actors seem oblivious to the fact that it is a comedy. Even the screenplay by the ever inventive Peter Benchley (oh, wait, is this yet ANOTHER story of a creature from the ocean gone amuck? ........ maybe he wasn't THAT inventive?) can't resurrect this drivel.  Kim Cattrall does not show enough TandA to offset her acting ""talents"", and Craig T. Nelson is the same brain-dead character he played on coach, but actually quite funny in THIS role , which is a departure for him. An interracial side story, (dream on white boy, dream on black girl) adds that extra bit of spice that elevates this story from the banal to the merely mundane. If you are a person who enjoys a good trepanning on a Saturday afternoon, this could be the film for you.
 I had to give it one star, there was no rating in the negative.",1302393600,3,1095,4.331707317073171
2825634,4,B000PMFRUQ,"I liked this movie because it is so entertaining and does pay off if you stick with it, it also has a good cast.

2825636,5,B000PMFRUQ,"CREATURE is a network TV mini-series from 1998. As such, it is far better than most of the junk on television! The story is interesting, the characters are fleshed out well, and the monster is incredibly realistic (thanks to Stan Winston) and menacing! Craig T. Nelson (POLTERGEIST) and Kim Cattrall (!!) are great as the scientists out to solve a series of mysterious deaths. The epic running time (3 hrs.) does tend to lag a bit, w/ sub-plots that meander along, but the core idea of a military cover-up / killer-monster is solid and downright fun to watch!

2825639,4,B000PMFRUQ,"I remember when this aired on network T.V in the late 90's as a mini-series, I was ready to tape it and while doing so a large thunder storm blew threw the Twin Cities and we had all these weather scrolls going across the screen, and then in the middle on night one we lost power...poof, so I had to wait until years later to see a blurry video copy a friend had just to catch the end so thanks MGM for the release on DVD so that takes care of that. This is an overly long film at almost 3 hours but I still love it, I mean it has it all, secret military research base, man-shark hybrid, sexy Kim Cattrall... Craig T. Nelson. Peter Benchley had great success with Jaws and this book came after the also popular "" The Beast "" and it is probably the weakest movie adaption out of the three, having said that I am still glad to own it finally as it is very entertaining. It is a little to preachy in the beginnig with the "" save the great white shark"" bit, and some of the early cheap military set ups don't look convincing ( The navy uniforms look thrown together from a thift shop) but the few good glimpses we see of the shark are very good, so although it has flaws it's worth a look, and if your like it check out Jeffery Combs in "" Hammerhead "" for a double feature.",1218153600,6,1269,4.0396825396825395
