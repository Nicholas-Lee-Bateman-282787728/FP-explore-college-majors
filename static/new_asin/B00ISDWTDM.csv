8645013,5,B00ISDWTDM,The Bride Wore Red was released in 1937. It starred Joan Crawford and it is her show all the way. A comedy with Joan playing a Bitch part. A strange combination but utterably watchable if you are a fan of Joan Crawford. Joan has to choose between two men. Fans of Joan Crawford will like this the most.,1505260800,,302,4.224137931034483
8645014,3,B00ISDWTDM,"The 2015 review by ""John Silence Is Golden"" is excellent. I agree with everything he wrote, but I have one thing to add ...

Joan Crawford's character isn't very likable. Anni is a gold-digger, and apparently has no qualms about busting up an engaged couple to snag a rich husband. It's hard to be sympathetic or identify with someone so self-involved and greedy.  It's true that she's played similar characters before and after this film but most of them seemed warmer and more human. Annie is a cold-hearted cash-seeking missile.

It's easy to understand why this is the film that got Joan labeled ""Box Office Poison"" back in the day. Still, any Joan Crawford fan should see it.",1503878400,,680,4.745762711864407
8645015,3,B00ISDWTDM,"Joan Crawford's peak period of popularity at the Box Office was between 1931 and 1936 where she made the exhibitors top 10 each year. From  1932,  the usual  MGM/ Crawford storyline formula was for Joan playing a the working class girl who meets one or more rich guys and after plot manuvers,  they  get married.  This MGM formula always included Joan being given  strong male co-stars including  Clark Gable in seven {7} of them. However from 1937 on, the public tired of the formula and Ms. Crawford's stardom entered a  prolonged decline that was not  arrested until she won the best actress honors for ""Mildred Pierce"" in 1945 after being dropped by Mgm in 1943, being off the screen for almost 2 years and now under contract to Warner Brothers.

This film adheres to the standard MGM / Crawford formula  scenario with its locale in Austria with the  plotline  a combination / blending of ""Cinderella"" meets ""Pygmalion"" meets  some uninspired MGM screenwriters. Ms . Crawford portrays a lower class diva of a low class cafe in Trieste ! who by some farfetched plot machinations gets her expenses paid for a 2 week jaunt at a swanky resort in the mountains  of the Austrian Tyrol  where she will get  to rub shoulders with ""high society"". Just why  ""high society"" would have been in the Austrian / Tyrol Mountains  circa 1937 is an unanswered question !  Like Cinderella she gets a new wardrobe and spiffy makeover and like Eliza Dolittle in  ""Pygmalion"" she gets to go to the ball and the chance to pretend to be something that she ""ain't"" - a society swell !

 She sparks the interest of two  polar opposite guys Robert Young {smooth and rich} and Franchot Tone { sardonic and poor}. If you know anything about 1930s  - 1940s movies Young and Tone are usually  the ""other man"" losing  the girl to Clark Gable or Robert Taylor so in this flick one of them finally will get  Crawford in the final Clinch ! . During her spiffy wardrobe makeover it will be a coveted red dress that she just had to have that  will be a major key to the whole situation in how the scenario plays out.

This is a mild comedy that is adaquently BUT only acted adaquently by its three leads with Ms. Crawford's performance in  particular lacking the light comedic touch necessary  for this  type. of film. The one outstanding performance is by  Billie Burke, excellent as  a  sharp eyed society matron who sees the ""grease spots"" beneath Joans spiffy makeover and their scenes together are the best things in the film.

 Director Dorothy Arzner { the only active woman film director in 1937 Hollywood} does her best to infuse some lively-ness in the proceedings and the production value are topnotch. So for Ms. Burke, Ms, Arzner and the nice production values I give this film a 3 star rating and  a lukewarm recommendation.",1445126400,2,2805,4.633401221995927
