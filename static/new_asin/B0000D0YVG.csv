1920373,3,B0000D0YVG,"One of the things that I appreciated most about this movie was its pace.  It has a great pace.  It keeps it moving without a lot of useless lag or irrelevant character building and it keeps it interesting.  It certainly recalls ""Deep Blue Sea"" and of course is not nearly as good but it still entertains quite well.  Also, I usually avoid any movie with the words ""Lorenzo"" and ""Lamas"" in them as I am not a fan but he does okay here.  There is overacting that is a bit humorous and unintentional (see: the submarine captain who only knows how to communicate and inspire by yelling) and the overall execution of the script with the budget they probably had was served very well.  The CGI sharks (no inserted shots of the real thing) are mediocre but definitely not horrible.  Also, we don't see a lot of them and that's okay because the plot is about survival, government conspiracy, and uncovering the past of the four main characters all of which is done decently.  I enjoyed this movie.  3.5 stars.

One last note: the movie is an ""R"" and it's not a very hard ""R"".  What cheeses me is that it didn't need to be an ""R"" at all as the elements that elevated to an ""R"" were some dude watching porn briefly in the beginning (and, unfortunately, we then did too), some light language, and a scene of Lamas in bed with a couple of blondes.  Taking all of this out wouldn't have made the movie suffer, at all, and could have been replaced with something else easily.  This would have made the movie a ""PG13"" and more accessible to a larger audience.  I mean, it would never become a classic, but it would have otherwise been a great movie for me to take and show the kids (juvenile boys) that I work with.  For that I am disappointed.",1347753600,,1729,4.359375
1920374,4,B0000D0YVG,"You know, I'm not a ""scary movie"" fan, so I almost never bought this, but I am a Lorenzo Lamas fan so I caved and bought it.  Surprisingly it's not a bad show, has some nice twists and descent action.  In my opinion the acting is descent and the story line not bad.  I'd watch it again.",1323734400,2,286,3.982456140350877
1920375,3,B0000D0YVG,"This movie was okay, but typical setting of scientists trying to create smarter sharks and trying to train them etc. If you like sharks, this might be for you.",1299542400,,159,4.517241379310345
1920376,5,B0000D0YVG,"hey, ok, its not a french artsy deep-thoughs masoquistic flick, its raw, bad effects, bad actors, bad NAVY uniforms, surreal situations (ex. why Lorenzo Lamas ask the girl to take out her shirt instead of him's to blood it for the sharks)... horrible computer graphics, but its so funny, makes laugh, its entertaiment , just for itself, really works. I saw it on TV once, and i purchased it, this is maybe the only DVD i have seen more than a couple of times. enjoy, also please notice on Stefan Lisenko shouting hysterically over and over and.. Simmone Mackinnon performs beatifully, as she is. (p.s. the sharks are soooo bad made, deserve further analysis)",1198540800,5,658,4.780701754385965
1920377,3,B0000D0YVG,"B Movies are meant to be ""guilty pleasure"" movies ... watched to satisfy those urges, instincts and desires that we're not always ready to admit to openly in public. Featuring various combinations of babe lust, wonton carnage, savage (or not so savage) brutality, far out locations, techno-junky-ism, monsters, weapon fetishes, space ships, mutants, armored vehicles and more babe lust, they come in Horror, Monster, Sci-Fi, Girly and many other sub-varieties. My reviews of such movies take this intentional ""guilty pleasure"" aspect into account and are written for people who enjoy either watching or making fun of this sort of entertainment at least some of the time. If you're looking for more than this from a B-movie ... (though it does happen occassionally), then you're not as smart as you think you are.

THIS movie probably wouldn't have held my attention for very long if it was just another ""scary"" shark movie, as my personal monster preferences don't focus on sharks. But Simmone MacKinnon is one of my all time favorite busty, Australian red heads. YEOUCH! Plot, script, production values ... who cares. If SJM is on screen (wearing bikini's and snug outfits that are more often wet than not) ... I'm game. Shallow, predictable, libidinous ... you bet. Life doesn't always have to be deep and thoughtful ... sometimes it can just be an experience of guilty pleasure. If you don't get that sort of thing ... well ... then WHY on EARTH were you watching THIS movie? : )",1128124800,5,1482,4.928
1920378,5,B0000D0YVG,"Some people might think that this is another stupid B-Movie with a ton of corny lines, crappy SFX, and a lame plot, but this was different.
  This movie has the best SFX for a B-Movie I have ever seen, and the sharks looked amazingly real, and the story well done. Hopefully, a lot of people see this show, because they deserve a taste of what low budget movies can be.
  Five stars.",1125964800,7,383,4.277777777777778
1920379,3,B0000D0YVG,"I wasn't planning on seeing an earth-shattering motion picture when I turned on ""Dark Waters.""  In fact, I was expecting to become bored about half-way through this flick.  Surprising to me, ""Dark Waters"" is actually a very good movie that suffers only from a lack of production funds and a modest script.  In short, it's a well above-average B-flick that is sure to satisfy even the stingiest and hard-nosed critic if they accept it for what it is.

It held my attention for its duration.  It doesn't get too completely outlandish, so far as the limits of a good B-flick are concerned.  Lorenzo Lamas is solid as the dashing hero of the film, and his supporting cast does well.  The sharks in this film aren't really the focus.  In fact, they are only around for brief flashes in the film, most notably when the trio of heroes dive into the realm of the sharks to escape their captors.  It's one of the most tense moments in the movie.

If you're looking for a good film that doesn't quite measure up to movies like ""Deep Blue Sea"" and ""Jaws,"" but is somewhat more entertaining than flicks like ""Project Viper"" and ""Sabretooth,"" I'm sure ""Dark Waters"" will suffice.

Recommended to fans of SciFi Channel movies that are above average when compared to most SciFi pictures.",1119225600,8,1272,4.6591928251121075
1920380,4,B0000D0YVG,"Others have compared this film to Deep Blue Sea.  That is slightly true in that there are several smart (well, trained, at least) sharks in this movie.  But it also borrows heavily from Shark Hunter (under water installation destroyed by sharks, down-on-luck scientist has super research sub, people smoke in rarefied environments, etc.).
In this movie we have a young scientist who is raising fake funds for an Atlantis mission, worries that he didn't sell enough books to cover the cost of the press conference, but owns a billion-dollar sub.  After being taken in by some seductive decoys, he is convinced to look into the destruction of an undersea base (located under a drilling platform).  The investigation takes his sub to its depth limit.  Enter coordinated shark attack.
Soon, ala James Bond, said scientist finds himself aboard a secret sub where they have been developing the attack sharks for the past 20 years.  He and his sidekick (a brainy, busty, oceanographer) baffle the crew with bluster before having to run for their lives.  Eventually we get to a cheesy ending involving reunited families, amazing discoveries, and credibility thrown out the window.
There are some odd bits to this film.  One is the offshore drilling platform.  At what should be where the shaft meets the seabed, there is an installation that looks like an underwater city (mistake or unexplained secret base?  My guess is the film makers didn't know anything about offshore drilling).  There is also the shark tank.  It is in the floor of the research lab with open water.  It also extends up in front of the lab so than an impressive window can be opened into it.  I shudder to think of the air pressure required to pull off this feat.
Still, there are some nifty shark attacks, a dead whale, cool subs, one of the stupidest rescues ever (it involves a raft and you have to see it to believe it), evil military, atoning scientists, a brainy busty oceanographer, and an amazing discovery.  Grade A cheese!",1082332800,13,1997,4.849557522123894

In this film, the U.S. Navy has trained great white sharks for weapons but cannot control them.  Okay, terrible plot, I admit, but, had there been a reason other than a government experiment gone wrong for wrongful purposes, this movie may have gotten a pass.

A C-movie with a dumb story, stiff acting, and some less than outstanding special effects, resulting in a film that can be enjoyed mostly for how inept and pretentious it is.

Lorenzo Lamas seems quite comfortable in these mundane slightly trashy roles, and he does them quite well, playing Dane Quatrell an explorer and conman trying to raise funds for a bogus expedition to discover Atlantis.  However he and his partner Robin Turner (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) are unexpectedly abducted, and roped into another venture involving the investigation of a mishap at a top secret underwater operation in the Gulf of Mexico.  While on the mission, Quatrell and Turner are taken prisoner on a submarine that is the breeding site for genetically modified sharks.  The laws of physics do not apply, as the heroes engage in a firefight, and manage to escape in a mini-sub, battling the giant sharks with a shotgun and torpedoes.

If you feel like slumming, and are in the mood for a ridiculous adventure, with some silly pretentious acting, and pretty dismal special effects, Dark Waters might just fit the bill.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1356048000,,1243,4.91866028708134
