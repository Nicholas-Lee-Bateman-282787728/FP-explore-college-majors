8027080,4,B0002E23IG,"This is a fairly typical hazardous mountain climbing story - which means that there is some spectacular scenery, as well as moments of suspense. The acting is good.

The film is in Russian, but there isn't a lot of dialog, so not a lot of subtitles to deal with for those who don't like them. In any event, if you imagined what they might be saying as the climbers face difficulties, you'd probably be pretty close to the actual dialog.

What sets this film apart for me, however, is the prominent appearance of Vladimir Vysotsky in the cast. He is an iconic figure of Soviet era music, film and theater. It was a treat to see him acting, and he also sings and plays guitar. If you love Vysotsky, as I do, you should see this. Without Vysotsky, I'd give the film a 2 or maybe a weak 3 - he makes the movie special.",1292544000,3,814,4.245161290322581
