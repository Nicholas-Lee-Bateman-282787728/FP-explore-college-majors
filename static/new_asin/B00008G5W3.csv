The movie begins with a boys choir singing about the Blessed Trinity in a church. Belle Boner has a nightclub and gambling resort in town. Judge Gray wants to shut down her high class joint. The boys choir sings again. Next the ""Sons of the Pioneers"" sing. Belle Bonner walks in to see Judge Gray, a man with a lot of pull in town. Belle offers a donation to the boys ranch if the Judge agrees to pull back. We learn that Judge Gray has a hidden past and an old real name when two men come to visit. They fight with the judge, there is a shot, then Springer and Madagan run out and drive away. After being pursued and shot at, their car runs out of gas. They get a ride to Bonner's place. The radio tells what happened to the judge. There is a dance for entertainment. The two men tell Belle about Tom Allison, the famous bank robber. Judge Gray says he didn't recognize the two men. It wasn't robbery, someone with a grudge, or mistaken identification.

There is a song. Belle has a personal interview with Judge Gray. She believes in ""live and let live"" but the judge won't play ball. Belle wants to get even. There is another song. An explosion attracts attention, two men robbed the Center City bank and made a getaway in their car. Did they leave a false clue? Judge Gray tells Roy about Springer and Madagan, and how he lacks an alibi because of a prank telephone call he received in the night. We hear the boys choir sing again. Terry Gray sends a letter to a friend in Boise, the state capital, to get a picture of Tom Allison. Frog has a plan to delay Bob. Roy brings the letter to Judge Gray. ""Its all right, Terry."" A prominent person is arrested for murder! Can the villains ensure the judge will be convicted? Can Roy and Frog save Judge Gray? [Note the use of dark filter to suggest night.] They hide in a canyon from the pursuing mob. Frog knows the two men.

Frog goes to Belle's place and drops an idea into Belle's and Duke's minds. They will hold-up the payroll truck to put the blame on Allison and Roy. But Frog was seen and is captured. Roy and Judge Gray follow them. Roy tells Bob about the events. There is a chase for action. The boys choir used their guns as the posse against the payroll truck robbers. Will the bad guys escape in that truck? Roy goes after them and uses a trick to derail their plans. There is another song. The J-bar boys ranch will get the reward for the capture of Springer and Madagan. Roy is back with the rangers, and wins Terry for a happy ending.

This is a complicated story about crime in the country. It could easily take place in some big city. The idea of a prominent citizen in town with a criminal past is unusual. Usually a trusted prominent person had a secret criminal connection. Having a woman as a villainess was unusual. Roy Rogers has gained singing skills. Smiley Burnette previously acted in Gene Autry's movies. Smiley and Gabby Hayes, comic sidekicks,  were among the most popular Western movie stars of that era. In this movie Smiley can't read a newspaper. In real life Smiley could play many musical instruments without being able to read or write music (like most musicians from earliest times).",1291075200,,3190,4.4
