The DVD is full of many different types of films about racism in the 20th Century. My favorite one is the one that compares the way we treated African Americans in the 1950s with facism during World War II.

The other clips make me realize that racism was much worse when my parents were growing up than they are today, but it makes me think about how we treat each other still.",1147132800,4,598,4.102564102564102
8174919,5,B0009RS0A6,"Racism is a difficult subject to deal with in a meaningful way. I'm intersted in the causes and effects of racism, but on the other hand it's hard to watch documentaries about racism without wondering about the racism of the commentator of the film.

I guess that's why these guys don't give us any real commmentary. Instead we see a bunch of films that document different types of racism - not just white on black, and lots of newsreels.

It left me with the responsiblility of figuring out where I stand in race relations and to what level I'm racist myself.

It's not a comfortable feeling, but it is a valuable one.",1146009600,3,619,4.508928571428571
