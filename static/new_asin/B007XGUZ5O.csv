5114105,5,B007XGUZ5O,"An entertaining and daring insight into the real world of ""diplomacy"" in the remotest parts of Africa. Great story -- excellent  filmmaking.",1354492800,,140,5.363636363636363
5114106,5,B007XGUZ5O,"Mads is the best docu-comedian I have ever seen. After seeing ""The Red Chapel"" I thought there would be no way for him to top his first feat of absurdist cinematic greatness. Luckily he does just that in ""The Ambassador."" The film is a fine expose of imperial Europe's reluctance to give up all of its old stomping grounds, and the eagerness of new world powers to move in on mineral rich territory. This is funny, tragic, and most certainly worth seeing. Also, with the amount that he spent bribing the shadowy underworld, Mads could probably use the money from fans. Enjoy!",1354060800,,575,4.647058823529412
5114107,5,B007XGUZ5O,"I thought it was scripted and acted, as no individual with a sane mind would film this cast of characters surreptitiously because if you are discovered, you are dead!  Throughout out the whole movie I was thinking how clever they were to script this film, get random people off the street to act, and use a crafty cinematographer who was able to give it a gritty, dirty documentary look.  That was an intriguing combination when mixed together!

But, nooooo!  After the movie I did a little digging and much to my surprise it was not acted!  Not scripted!  Was shot undercover!  I found a whole new level of respect for Mads, plus his secretary/production manager, and the movie moved up to the top notch after discovering how it was created.

AAAAA+++++  WILL SEE AGAIN.",1347062400,5,771,4.6940298507462686
5114108,5,B007XGUZ5O,"I saw this documentary at the Toronto ""Hot Docs"" documentary film festival.  It is the best documentary I've ever seen.  It is such an expos into the world of diamond smuggling and corruption in Africa, but it is also darkly funny.  You will be shocked while laughing at the same time, and shocked that you are laughing.  Watch it!",1346889600,2,331,4.559322033898305
8522892,4,B007XGUZ5O,"One of the most unique documentaries I have ever seen.  It's honestly pretty crazy and  while the New York Post claims it is real, it's hard to believe at times.  Still if you want a look into how corrupt, hard, and dangerous it can be to do business in a war zone, this is a great movie to watch.  The absurdities pile up on one another and while you are left with questions, (Where did this guy get the 10 million francs?  Did he actually end up selling blood diamonds?) .  There are hardly any films out there about the Central African Republic, but this one probably gives you a good glimpse of what life can be like there.",1482105600,,627,4.226890756302521
8522893,4,B007XGUZ5O,Very interesting visit to Africa. Makes me want to be an ambassador.,1481500800,,68,4.75
8522894,5,B007XGUZ5O,"You gotta watch this,  this guy attempts to pull off one of the craziest international business ventures I've ever seen or even heard of anything done like this before and to think he was able to film the entire process (mostly with hidden cameras) is unbelievable.  I don't want to spoil any of the story but let's just say this is just a regular guy who's not rich nor does he have powerful connections yet his ambition is to own a Diamond mine in Africa and is willing to meet his goal no matter what the cost.  This doc has everything, suspense, humor, adventure, it's educational, and very unpredictable.  Is an amazing story and a must see; I rate this as a rare 5 star... You're gonna love it.  http://docjunky.com/the-ambassador/",1426118400,,737,4.638461538461539
8522895,5,B007XGUZ5O,So real. This is what goes on daily behind the scenes.,1416960000,,54,4.0
8522896,4,B007XGUZ5O,"Amazing that it is actual real footage of the level of corruption in Africa.  The fact that you can buy diplomatic credentials is so disturbing yet fascinating as well.

The reporter is incredible brave to bring this story to world.  I'm not sure how it was financed because it seems that he had to actually pay quite a bit of money in bribes.

It's an important story that needs to be told; though it is not a gripping story because real life, including corrupt people is quite mundane.",1404345600,,487,4.5
8522897,2,B007XGUZ5O,"An interesting concept - a filmmaker takes his life in his hands impersonating a diplomat in a highly corrupt and dangerous country. Definitely an interesting concept. Unfortunately we got all that in the first 15 minutes, and the movie went on for more than an hour and a half. At about 1:10, we gave up and skipped to the last 5 minutes to see how it all turned out. No surprises.",1372550400,,382,4.394366197183099
8522898,4,B007XGUZ5O,"I am very pleased with the purchase of this movie.  I read a review of it in the New York Observer and decided to buy it, once it was released.  I will say, it is a very interesting and good movie.  For those who have traveled to and have knowledge of Africa, we can relate to corruption and how things can be done with bribes, etc.

I would recommend this movie highly!",1365724800,,370,4.097222222222222
8522899,4,B007XGUZ5O,"It is really hard to believe that a) anyone could be so bold or stupid as to film all the scenes that appear as certain death surely would lurk on every corner and b) that if indeed it was true he never seems to have been caught out. I am still uncertain as to how much is real and how much was added later. In any event it plays as if all of it could be true and we all know that much of Africa operates in such a way, the CAR is no exception, what about Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Congo as obvious examples.
Whichever way you look at it the film is an almost unbelievable romp. The disc has a few menu faults as the selections are cross linked and you have to try your luck to get the extras.",1365552000,,689,3.893617021276596
8522900,3,B007XGUZ5O,".....and though it's in Africa and perhaps somewhat more pronounced, it's probably no more abundant than it is here in the U.S.",1361491200,,127,4.818181818181818
8522901,4,B007XGUZ5O,"Loved the movie.  Mads takes lots of subtle jabs at just about everyone - the locals, foreigners, Europeans, Africans, and the law and those who break it.  Hilarious.  ...little conclusion at the end however. And the source of his money and presence of the cameraman while people tell secrets messes with your ability to believe it's all true.",1358553600,,343,4.879310344827586
