8329582,5,B001O4C6LC,"Fallen Angel draws controversial review, and I found it to be 4.7 stars worth of gripping, chilling, intrigue. It is the TV series adaptation uses the same renaming title of a trilogy originally called Roth Trilogy by award-winning British crime novelist Andrew Taylor. Although each of the 3 stories are shortened for 69 minute TV episodes, the author praises the work and its trueness to the theme. The novelist wrote his 3 novels in the same reverse chronological order to the epic story as is used for the TV series. Each episode is titled the same as the books. Altering time sequence is nothing new to novels, an intellectual aspect often causing the consumer more thought potential. Doing the same thing in TV is more daring, causing some viewers to feel lost.
Sudden criminal death seems to follow and consume every generation and the reversal of time segments adds to the mystery, turning WHO-dun-it into a psychological story of WHY-dun-it. It becomes a story of a murderess and how she psychologically developed. One could watch the series by viewing episodes in the order of 3-2-1, simplifying the storyline, but eliminating much of the mystery.

FALLEN ANGEL relies on well-developed characters driving the storytelling, and giant award-winning actors have been used for the TV episodes. Emilia Fox (Pride and Prejudice beginning to Silent Witness) stars as the older Angel/Rosie. Lead male, former vicar David (Charles Dance -Game of Thrones Bleak House) joins Wendy (Clare Holman Insp Morse) through whose eyes and memory the story is told. Other roles include a myriad of top-star acting careers of which only a few are noted here, with but a bit of their accomplishments. Mark Benton (Land Girls The Street), Rosie Day as the small child who can be seen now in an adult role in Outlander, Claudie Blakley (Grantchester Larkrise to Candleford), Emma Fielding (Cranford) Oliver Dimsdale (Mr Selfridge Grantchester), Donald Sumpter (Game of Thrones The Mill), and so many more that should be mentioned. A superior cast list.

SDH SUBTITLES for feature and bonus
[1] ""The Four Last Things"" ==Present Day and this first episode is truly a thriller, rather than just crime mystery. A bizarre psychological nightmare is unveiled as Michael & Vicar Sallys child is abducted. Police begin to find child body parts. Throughout the police investigation, characters are developed and their inter-connectedness revealed.
[2] ""The Judgement of Strangers"" ==1991. The story reverses back to Davids memories as Rosie as a teen. Lives are connected via the ghost of a dismissed vicar, some characters are driven to obsession over that past. Nephew Michael is living at the vicarage, a place of dysfunction and troubles. A church fete gets out of hand in so many despicable ways.
 [3] ""The Office of the Dead"" ==1979. Further back into time of the characters finds Rosie as a 5-year-old girl, being recalled by Wendy who came to join Davids vicarage when she thought her own marriage ending. She moves in, as does the father/grandfather suffering from early dementia. New problems in the extended family arise. Rosies relationship with her grandfather is a thing psychology will debate forever. There are ties even back then to the historically discharged vicar of the secret and rumored diabolical past.
[Bonus] Behind-the-Scenes films the author, cast, and others talking for 47 minutes about the psychology of this trilogy mystery. The bonus could be said to be the making of the making of a psychopathic killer.

Im keeping the DVD copy (purchased elsewhere) for a future second viewing, the story/acting is that good, although be warned, certainly NOT a warm-fuzzing series. Darkly themed, graphic, with nudity; adult orientation.",1481846400,,3734,5.14662273476112
8329583,1,B001O4C6LC,I bought this dvd because of the wonderful cast & all of the stars. It is ONLY because of this cast that I continued to watch it to the end hoping against hope that things would improve...things did not ever improve. This has to be the most poorly written story I've seen in a long time. Everything makes little sense. There are no natural consequenses to anyone's acts. Basically it follows two screwed up parents barely raising a really messed up daughter & a confused close friend protecting this same daughter. The repetitive theme of music & sound is unsuccessfully trying to give mystery to this silly story. Terrific acting simply cannot overcome the ridiculous script. Actually I don't understand everyone's great review...did we all watch the same story?????,1471305600,,767,4.953488372093023
8329584,1,B001O4C6LC,"This was not listed as being the cut version and even mentions on the box that it is the ""uncut version"" yet it is missing two songs/scenes that are only on the uncut version, one of which happens to be one of my favorite songs. As I feel this was not properly represented I certainly do not like that. This is the first rating I have left for an item, so I don't know if this reflects on the seller or on the product itself, so let me be clear about this. I ""Love It"" (5 stars) as the musical itself, but I ""Hate It"" for the false representation from the seller.",1364169600,,563,4.035714285714286
8329585,5,B001O4C6LC,I cant really put a review here with out spoiling it but it was awesome and so is Charles Dance.,1356480000,,96,3.85
8329586,2,B001O4C6LC,"This might be a thrill for certain people in a funk that want to exorcise their gnarly demons. I tried to enjoy this story, but conclude that there is a dark intention underlying the whole thing. It's very negative and Anti-Christianity, or whatever form of religion is being represented by the man in the collar. Hate to say it, but it seems like another brick in the Satanic wall. There are forces at work which aren't plainly visible to the eye. Having turned from a God of love, people are drifting into alot of junk. There is a strange noise throughout much of the program which is very unnerving. It's like a drawn out depressing version of The Omen, although I rate The Omen as a classic horror movie and Fallen Angel as NOT GOOD. There's that noise again!!",1286928000,2,764,4.503597122302159
8329587,3,B001O4C6LC,"It is a theme that is uncomfortable to contemplate, and despite an excellent cast, unconvincing. I don't think any of the actors were at fault. I do think it is very difficult to get that close to knowing or even having genuine understanding of the basis for pyschopathy, and being able to come from that mindset while portraying the lives of fairly ordinary people with generally good intentions with a psychopath in their midst.",1285459200,,430,4.824324324324325
8329588,4,B001O4C6LC,"I find it rare to see a story told out of order work so well. This BBC mini series tells the tale in three distinct parts, starting with the most recent events and going to the oldest.

We see the life of a young woman unravel to the point where she kidnaps a little girl, but her motives stem from her own childhood resentments. As the tale goes on, we see more how the older members of her family failed to get her the mental help she needed.

Emilia Fox plays the title role as Rosie 'Angel' Byfield. She manipulates a pedophile into helping her kidnap little girls and finally plots to take the daughter of her rival. In the second episode, we see her as a young woman struggling with a new stepmother and a mysterious drug using boyfriend. Finally, we see her childhood where her mother kills herself after being suspected of stabbing senile grandpa.

We need all three episodes for a complete picture of who this girl becomes. Each tale shines a light on a different corner of her mind, but leaves enough up in the air to draw us to the next part. It explores side plots of working mothers, relationship dynamics and faith without ever pushing any topic in your face.

I found it interesting and stimulating. I bet you will too.",1255910400,9,1234,4.422907488986784
8329589,3,B001O4C6LC,"This is a very nice series that has a very solid story. Found it unlike other ""crime"" dramas. The pacing is slow. Story doesn't drag but doesn't move at decent clip either. The packaging is unfortunately bulky. If you are a fan of English drama's check it out. This series is based off three books. I believe something was lost in the transition from book to film.",1243728000,4,364,4.447761194029851
