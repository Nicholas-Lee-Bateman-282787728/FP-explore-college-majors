2274851,5,B0009ALW5S,"Just need to say that this was the first Broadway show I had ever seen and from that time I was hooked. I was hooked on broadway, hooked on Melba, and HOOKED ON THE SHOW PURLIE.  I have this VHS and paid alot for it.  If you have the chance to get it I would if I were you.  I have met Melba and she said she doesn't even have it.",1154649600,4,330,3.619718309859155
2274852,5,B0009ALW5S,"Adapted from the play Purlie Victorious, this positive musical is a joy to watch, over and over.  I have always been an advocate for taping Broadway productions with the original cast before it all disappears forever.  I saw the play on Broadway with Cleavon Little in the title role and he was more dynamic than TV's Benson, Robert Guillaume, but that matter little here.

Purlie, has returned home to his sister's shack on a cotten farm in Georgia to try to get a building to be a church from ""Captain"" Cotchapee, who ""just loves his darkees"".  His scheme includes a young girl, Lutibelle Gussimay Johnson, who was a kitchen worker and is pretending to be a college-educated cousin of Purlie's.

Melba Moore became a star in the role of Lutibelle and her solo, ""I've got Love"" is an absolute show-stopper.  Moore, who looks like she barely weighs 90-lbs has the breath control of a swimmer and the range of Ima Sumak.  The video-production is excellent and the cast, outstanding.

Broadway fans will be knocked-out by this show.  A must see and a prize in anyone's collection.",1131926400,10,1078,4.752688172043011

8058933,5,B0009ALW5S,"I originally watched this version on Showtime back in the early 1980's.  I loved the storyline and the beautiful singing (especially Melba Moore's powerful rendition of ""I've Got Love."")  For people under 30, this play is a good example of just how far African Americans have come.  My parents grew up in a situation similar to what was in the play.  They told me that I have it made compared to their lives. The people in this play were victims of racism; nevertheless, they rose above it.  They didn't succumb to their predicament  (a great life lesson).  I was saddened by the passing of Linda Hopkins this year (singer of the opening song "" Walk Him Up The Stairs "" and the recent  loss of Sherman Hemsley (aka Gitlow).",1499904000,,723,4.550387596899225

8058935,5,B0009ALW5S,"This is an amazing piece of American Theater History.  Purlie, the musical version of the black and white film Purlie Victorious by Ozzie Davis.  The original stage play and movie starred Ozzie Davis and his wife Ruby Dee.  This is an excellent musical version starring Robert Guillome and Melba Moore.  A great story of the Black American south and white allies.  Saddly still relevant today.  This great performances version I used to have on Betamax and unfortunately the quality looks as if it was taken from a copy that old.  However this is worth watching and owning for future generations.",1435881600,,596,4.9
8058936,4,B0009ALW5S,"It would be hard to find someone who had ever heard of it.  I have had the LP cast recording for years and looked forward to seeing it, although I must have seen in sometime in my past because I recognized the scenes.  My only disappointment is the audio fidelity.  I know it was recorded in a theatre instead of a recording studio. Too bad.",1392940800,2,341,4.2153846153846155
8058937,5,B0009ALW5S,I did the musical back in the early 70's. It forever changed my life. We toured all over the country. This work shows the genuis of Ozzie Davis. I also saw the play with Clevon Little and Melba Moore. This is an excellent play and musical. Ozzie teaches as he entertains. If you can get this you won't go wrong.,1392336000,4,311,4.2
8058938,5,B0009ALW5S,"I saw the Broadway show back in the early 70s.  Don't know exact date.  I have the LP and music book.  I would love having the DVD, but I simply can't afford that kind of money.  Any suggestions?

8058939,5,B0009ALW5S,"I chose 5 stars because of the casting, because of the chorus which was fabulous, because of the dancers which were wonderful and because of Melba Moore whom I just love. Sherman was fantastic.",1386892800,2,193,4.705882352941177
8058940,5,B0009ALW5S,"My mom took me to see the show the day the show won a Tony Award that evening. I was also hooked on Broadway shows and great singers which Melba Moore's ""I Got Love"" went right through me.  We purchased the soundtrack and I played that album so much, my father and brother threatened to disable the stereo just to have quiet in the house.  Whoever is in charge of reproducing the video of the play with Melba Moore and Cleavon Little, please make it in the DVD format so everyone who watches it will experience theater at it's finest.  I am anxiously waiting for a copy of a DVD version but will gladly buy a VHS version.",1338681600,5,621,4.245762711864407
8058941,5,B0009ALW5S,"I watched this with my mother as a preteen, she has now passed on. I am working on sharing the reason for Black History month with my kids.  I referenced something from the play and my daughters looked puzzled. I then said, ""the play with Melba Moore"".  Seeking a copy to enlighten our youth. They both said ""Who's Melba Moore? 'nuff said---Contact me at disney3dee@yahoo.com, I want it on VHS or DVD.",1329350400,3,401,4.555555555555555
