It looks fine, but I haven't have the opportunity to watch it yet, so I don't know if all the dvds are fine and not damaged as it happened to me with one of the dvds of La Otra of Juan Soler. The last episode of the second dvd of that soapopera was damaged, and I had to switch to the third and last dvd that it was not in perfect condition, but you could still watch it.",1443916800,,416,3.8488372093023258

8258697,4,B0015I2S38,"The novela was beautiful something different for a change. I gave it 4 stars because the editing was horrible and I did not like when the other scenes were cut, its like you cannot even tell what is going on exactly. But other than that me encanta. :-)",1322352000,5,252,4.270833333333333
8258698,3,B0015I2S38,"Unfortunately, this telenovela looks like it has potential.  It has the usual plot elements that can make a telenovela fun to watch such as drama, comedy, and notable characters.  However, whoever butchered this from the original cut so many scenes making the viewer have to guess and try to infer what happened previously because of the blatant gaps that were taken out.  It is frustrating at times to know that a scene stops abruptly and to know that there should be more to the scene, that it feels unfinished.  Or to see arguments between key characters that seem irreparable and then moments later those same characters are reconciled without ever having addressed the issue.  There are quite a few telenovelas that are cut but are done in a way where a viewer new to the show would not notice and would be able to follow the entire show.  This is not one of them.  The show is good from what I've seen and that's why I give it the 3 stars, but it loses 2 because of the excessive editing.",1264291200,2,994,4.488888888888889

8258700,4,B0015I2S38,"Trpico es una Telenovela filmada en Repblica Dominicana con actores nacionales e internacionales.
En este DVD podrn encontrar la historia bien resumida de lo que fu la puesta en pantalla de la novela.
Los DVDs son tres (3) en los cuales encontramos toda la telenovela expuesta en 10 capitulos de una hora. Como  bonos especiales los DVDs tienen fotos de produccin, los mejores besos (que, de paso, recomiendo ver al final de todo para que no vean algunas escenas que adelatan el final) y el trailer.
Es un Gran resumen ya que la misma est supuesta a durar algunas cuarenta y tantas horas y solo vemos aca 10. Igual, es un bonito recuerdo.",1207526400,7,638,4.646017699115045
