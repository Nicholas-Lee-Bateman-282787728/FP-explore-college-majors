5382157,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"This DVD told me so much behind the scenes info I was amazed. The suit actors are great and informative. Following the making of a suit from beginning to end is awesome. It is a must have for any monster and/or cinema enthusiast. I'm buying a copy for each of my cousins. They are really interested in cinematic history and  this film will not only entertain but it will teach them a lot about their favorite characters from Godzilla to Predator; Alien to Hellboy and many more. In my opinion ""Men In Suits"" is great for all ages 13+; and in some cases for mature monster lover 8 year olds.",1354665600,6,590,4.363636363636363
5382158,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"Haruo Nakajima, Bob Burns, Doug Jones and others all great actors share their experiences on sets. Plus some behind the scenes stuff. A perfect gift for people who are interested in an art form of little recognition.",1370476800,,216,4.864864864864865
5382159,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"If you can, you're the audience for this DVD and I recommend it to you wholeheartedly.  If you can't name one (or give a vague description ""That guy that played the Predator...Harry Henderson?"") I'm surprised that you're reading this review at all.  Move along now.  Or not, you might still enjoy it.  What do I know?",1366675200,,317,4.607142857142857
5382160,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"This film highlights the history,advancment,and stars of suit performing. It shows the challenges of performing in  costume, and the skills needed to be succesful at it.

A must own for fans of creature design, and practical movie effects.",1366502400,,239,5.2631578947368425
5382161,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"If you love monsters, giant robots and aliens this film is for you. The filmmaker takes you behind-the-scenes on such films as Alien, Hellboy, and Pan's Labyrinth through interviews with the men who wear the suits, and those who make them. It's fascinating, funny and entertaining filmmaking. I highly recommend it.",1364860800,,315,5.196078431372549
5382162,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"While many genre fans may have some knowledge of the men behind the masks in their favroite films, the true back stories remain untold. This fascinating documentary touches on a subject that has been relatively unexamined until now. Obviously a labor of love, the creative team takes their time to flesh out the details, joys and agonies of those playing movie monsters inside suits. We are treated to a look at everyone from Bob Burns to Janos Prohaska. This is a loving tribute and an extremely well done homage to the men who brought some of our favorite screen monsters to life. Recommended!",1364083200,,595,4.786407766990291
5382163,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"This is a wonderful video with interviews from many of the hidden talents in the movies. The ones who play the creaturs, monsters, and non-humans in suits - and then do their very best to make you belives that 50lbs of latex and animatronics is the real thing.
Even in your only area of costuming is putting on a fursuit at a convention this video gives loads of tips on how to make your character really stand out.
For the movie lover there is loads of snippets and behind the scenes info on some of the most memerable films.
I'd definately recommend this movie for anyone who loved films, oir performing on costumes.",1364083200,,618,4.477876106194691
5382164,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"Men in Suits peels back the layers of fur, foam and makeup and gives us a glimpse at the actors who bring on screen creatures to life.  In a day and age where CG is so prevalent, this film celebrates the artistry of these performers who tax themselves mentally and physically to create memorable on screen performances.

The film tackles the subject with zeal and features interviews with some of the more memorable actors such as Haruo Nakajima (Godzilla), Doug Jones (Hellboy - Abe Sapien & Pan's Labyrinth - The Fawn), Bob Burns (The Ghost Busters - Tracy the Gorilla) & Van Snowden (H.R. Pufnstuff) and many others. You'll remember their characters even if you've never seen their face before.  The footage from many of these productions really put the actors and their work into context and gives the viewer a chance to look past the suit at the actor working inside it.  We also get a behind the scenes look as one actor goes through the fitting process then finally dons the final monster/demon suit for the feature film The Knights of Badassdom.

Stylistically there are a few choices that bug me in how the film was edited (such as an occasional key word on the screen or the random b&w profile shot of an interview subject) but the content is so solid I can overlook these pet peeves.

The DVD itself is great with a clean menu structure and a few bonus features such as some interview outtakes, panel discussion at the 2011 Monsterpalooza, and a still gallery.  Monster movie fans will love this film while they may know who these actors are, they probably have not gotten a chance to hear them talk in such depth and with such devotion about their craft.",1363132800,5,1666,4.608108108108108
5382165,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"This documentary is totally fascinating. I was glued to watching it from start to finish. Every stage is so well thought out, informative and entertaining. I learned so much and thoroughly and now I appreciate the men inside and behind the suits that make them so realistic. I cannot chose a favourite man (or woman) in a suit because they are all so varied and unique. I loved this work.",1362700800,,388,4.557142857142857
5382166,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"I'm a fan of monster movies, and this documentary was an awful lot of fun to watch.  Men in suits are not just background decoration on the stage or screen, they are hardworking professionals, bringing the monsters to life.",1362182400,,223,4.717948717948718
5382167,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"A fantastic look at the actors who wear creature costumes ranging from Robby the Robot to Alien. We get to not only learn about the costumes themselves but the performances that bring them to life. Did you know the original Godzilla was made from discarded auto tires? Or that one of it's wearer was trained to be a kamikaze in WWII?
We also find out how CGI is being used more & more to enhance costumes rather than try to replace them.
Definitely worth a look to any monster fan.",1361836800,,481,4.355555555555555
8546837,4,B00A5DJKWQ,"Dinosaurs. Monsters. Gorillas. Aliens. Creatures.
From the outset, this DVD brings a fresh, funny and enlightening approach to those unsung men and women of the Hollywood.
Learn about the guys who toiled and sweated under the fur and rubber of your favourite monsters, hear some of the classic creature stories from the mighty Bob Burns himself, and also more modern marvels from the likes of Hellboys' Doug Jones and Bryan Steele.
We also get to meet the man who was Godzilla, and it is very clear how much these people enjoyed their work, as gruelling and difficult as it must have been at the time.
An unmissable documentary, for any with even the slightest question of how they did that and who did it.",1434412800,,706,4.701612903225806

8546843,5,B00A5DJKWQ,"Then this is for you.  It's a documentary so there's a lot more talking than scenes from splatter movies, but that's what is supposed to happen.  You get to see suit creation, learn about the history of suits, and hear from the actors inside.  My only complain about it is that I wanted more.

Great documentary and purchase.",1394668800,,325,4.551724137931035
