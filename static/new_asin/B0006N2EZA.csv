2189846,5,B0006N2EZA,"Candice Bergen is Murphy Brown, a hard-nosed Washington D.C. journalist who is just returning from a stint at the Betty Ford clinic for her alcohol abuse. In this work-situation comedy our main character has lots of friends who will encourage her to stay on the proverbial road to sobriety.

Eldin Bernecky (Robert Pastorelli) is the handyman who never can quite seem to finish work on her (obviously pricey) D.C. townhouse---but can however find time to deliver good-natured quips.

Her boss, the neurotic Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) is a reccent Harvard graduate who is more nervous than tyranical. Something Murphy or one of the other journalists does always has him reaching for the stomach medicine. He's so cute when he's having one of many stressful moments!

Murphy's best friend is Francis 'Frank' Fontana, another journalist at this same series. Before she tangled with the likes of Dan Quayle, Murphy confronted having to work with somebody as chipper as young Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford), who would later add an element of soap by inexplicably marrying Miles. Of all the 'FYI staff', she also was the one person I could not stand. Sherwood seemed overly hyper compared to the other cast, and out of place in any Washington D.C. news organization.

Finally there is anchor Jim Dial (Charles Kimbrough) who really is a likeable guy, but comes across as unbelievably pompus and self-absorbed. He and Murphy are not close friends because they share some character traits (like always having to be right and get the last word in).

Much more jaded than Mary Richards (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) Murphy is the character whom you look to for inspiration when your own chips are down...but you never hope to tick off. The late 1980's/early 1990's fashions are a hoot, but I still like this series. It would be a cute addition for anybody wanting to put on a 'strong women' and/or 80's night.",1101945600,7,1898,4.91875
2189847,5,B0006N2EZA,"Dan Quayle may not be thrilled, but we are!

Miles is the young executive producer in his first job after graduation from Harvard.

15. Mama Said: Murphy's meddling mother comes to visit.
16. Moscow on the Potomac: Murphy prepares for a broadcast with a Soviet broadcaster.

My only problem with this purchase is that unlike most good TV shows, only one DVD is offered for sale. No clue as to why this limitation exists. Anyway, this is the reason for the four star rating, as opposed to a five star rating.

2189855,4,B0006N2EZA,"I loved ""Murphy Brown"" when it aired. Still do love it. The ensemble is perfect and a wonderful foil for Bergen. The scripts hold up even now - maybe politics doesn't change so much. Alas, Bergen's own performance does not add up. She's way too flamboyant, her vocal range is limited, and her acting range not too terrific. Nevertheless, she was brave to take on the part, and she must have gotten better through the years because I don't remember thinking of her as anything but wonderful. I would love to see another season or more to check myself on that.",1481241600,,558,4.534653465346534

Some of the junk released on DVD of old TV shows and ""film"" shame me and the industry! But you don't release good old Murphy and the gang, with their intelligent dialogue, snappy repertoire, great acting, that kept us laughing week after week?  I look fondly back on so many hilarious episodes -- like when Murphy had her baby? What about when she had a pain and Miles slid under her in a panic, with a pillow? Miles' face and voice, nursing his ulcer?  When Murphy and Frank ""died"" in a dream and Corkie dressed her in -- horrors -- a dickie!  Murphy says, ""I wouldn't be caught dead in a dickie! And look! There I am! Dead! In a dickie!""

Now, listen, I was, and AM, a political conservative, and if I, OF ALL PEOPLE, want Murphy back, think of all those to the left that would love it!!",1432857600,20,927,4.214689265536723

2189884,5,B0006N2EZA,"This show is fantastic! Excellent writing and great cast. I was young when the show first aired, so a lot of it didn't stick with me, but I remember my mom liked watching it and I liked what I understood when I saw it with her. I got a refresher the short time it aired on Nick at Nite and I bought this set not long after it came out. Though some of the current event references from the time it originally aired have to be googled, the show is still very funny! Getting Candice Bergen's behind the scenes commentary on the pilot episode was very interesting. I wish she would've recorded commentary for all of them on this set. I really wish more seasons would be released because I would much prefer popping in a dvd of a show I love like Murphy Brown than to watch some of the stupid shows making it on tv today. It's a shame to let a great show with a great cast like this just sit in history and not let it be enjoyed by newer generations.",1430524800,,945,4.113513513513514

2189892,5,B0006N2EZA,"I grew up watching ""Murphy Brown"" and was very positively influenced by the first truly strong, independent and intelligent female character on television who was more focused on career than getting married and having kids. That was huge for me as an adolescent and still affects me today. I love this series and am so disappointed they haven't released more seasons on DVD. However, as of this review, Encore Classic is playing ""Murphy Brown"" reruns twice a day-- thank goodness we can find it somewhere!

Each character is well-defined but not a simple caricature.  All the actors are very talented.  Diane English created a classic show.  Many of the themes were ahead of their time for TV.  It is very funny, but also can be poignant.  This show dealt with alcoholism, unwed mothers, definition of family, lots of taboo topic for broadcast TV, using a strong female character with her own flaws.
How many TV characters are lambasted by the Vice President of the United States (as if it is a real person)?

Now I am ACHING for the rest of the series to be released (particularly the season when Murphy finally has her baby).

I'd really like to know how many sets have been sold and how many it would take for the WB to think about giving us more.

I will not lie, I'm not a fan of the shotty cardboard slip case or the fact that the discs overlap each other, but if you can get past that, they did a good job releasing this show and the retrospective with the original cast is a nice touch.

Don't not buy this set if you fear owning just the first season!  If you want more of this show like I do, bite the bullet and buy this show, and maybe if enough of us do this, we'll get that long awaited season two!",1278547200,4,1079,3.944700460829493

The mainstream media is still coming up with ridiculous ways to increase ratings/profits, still hiring unqualified beauty queens as news anchors, etc.  The only difference is that real journalists like Murphy are a dying breed.

This is probably the only reason that could cause such a long delay.

It's a pity because this was an awesome show with a great cast and excellent writing. It was so original and fresh when it arrived on the television landscape. Hopefully the issues causing the delay of future seasons will become resolved one day soon.",1192665600,5,584,4.407407407407407
2189985,5,B0006N2EZA,"If you watched Murphy Brown like I did in the 1980s on Monday night television, it was groundbreaking with 5 time Emmy Winner Candice Bergen playing the title role as a brash, no-nonsense, tough talking determined and ambitious journalist. She reminds me of the wonderful Christiane Amanpour CBE in some ways. Murphy Brown does have her share of problems as well like she just returned from the Betty Ford Clinic for detoxication. She is greeted with the everchanging flow of secretaries, a younger executive producer played brilliantly by Grant Shaud as Miles Silverberg, and the Miss America turned journalist Corky Sherwood Forrest played by Faith Ford. She looks to Murphy as her mentor not a backstabbing journalist in episode two. The cast is perfect in their roles with Pat Corley playing Phil, the bar owner of Phil's which is a well-known established place in Washington D.C., Joe Regalbuto as Frank Fontana, the bachelor investigative journalist; stage veteran Jim Kimbrough as Jim Dial, who is the show's Dan Rather. Also, we can't forget Robert Pastorelli who was cast as Murphy's house painter who leaves years later. Sadly, Pastorelli died under tragic circumstances. One of the reasons that this show lasted eleven seasons with changes in cast and crew but the show always bounced back stronger than ever. This show was one of the best sitcoms on the air then and now. Too bad, they don't air it in reruns or repeats like they used too but you have DVDs to enjoy them forever.",1187913600,5,1491,4.920634920634921

2189987,5,B0006N2EZA,"The people have spoken (have you READ all these reviews, Warners?) and WE WANT THE REST OF THE MURPHY BROWN SEASONS ON DVD---COMPLETE SEASONS, NOT CUT FOR SYNDICATION !! Only a gnat-brain would question the quality of the ""Murphy Brown"" series. Do you remember, Warners, that it was the crown jewel of CBS' Monday night line-up? Ten seasons of good ratings don't mean anything to you? Didn't make enough dough on the release of the first season, Warners? Well---(forgive me, consumers everywhere, for I do something now that I never dreamed I would ever do)---try RAISING THE PRICE from that of the surprisingly inexpensive first season.  wow, what a concept!)Or a box set of all the seasons together---fans will buy it, Warners.  Limited release, maybe, if you're afraid to invest in a full-scale release.  There are a lot of ways to do it. We still have cash to spend on a quality product that is obviously in demand. You're intelligent, creative businesspeople at Warners, right? You do realize that not every product you send out is going to bring in the revenue of a major blockbuster. (We can just see you now, scratching your heads and going ""Hey, that's right !"") ONE of you should be able to figure out how to produce a decent profit on a treasure that's sitting on your shelf. What is WRONG with you????? ---- UPDATE: its now 2010.  The intrepid Brothers Warner are still picking their noses, releasing a lot of garbage onto DVD, while a high-quality, hip,award-winning, funny, popular, highly rated, well-produced series like ""Murphy Brown"" continues to molder.  And these WB people are paid salaries.  Go figure.  2011 UPDATE----STILL NO PROGRESS.  Here it is, coming up to 2012, and the Warner Weenies are still asleep. Still no ingenuity, no idea how to make a profit from a quality product...in spite of all the public clamor for the rest of this outstanding series. Sure, Warners, use your time to market the crud stuff, and leave the gold locked up in the vault.  And you went to college?  MORE UPDATE: January 2013----countless meaningless, puppy-poopie series are still being released on DVD, while ""Murphy Brown"" remains in exile. The highly-paid Warners executives continue to prove their artistic integrity......ANOTHER UPDATE:  September 2015.  Look, people are still commenting on this series now, many years after Season 1 was released. THEY WANT TO BUY IT.  WE WANT TO SPEND MONE-E-E-EY.  Will somebody in Sales and Marketing please come to life and do something?  Thank you so much.  UPDATE: this year is winding down, and we're coming up to 2017. There's been hearsay about a problem with the music rights. Boo hoo. As cool as Murphy's Motown sounds are, the songs played for a few seconds during the opening credits, and were not integral to the plots. So if the greed-mongers at Motown are stalling the release of this great series, cut the music out! It won't affect the show more than a percentage or two, and most fans would rather have that than nothing. It was the loyal fans who made it a success in the first place, remember ?

The only exception  to this seems to be ""Roseanne"" and that is probably because she still owns part of her shows and insisted on a schedule release  as part of the contract before the first season came out. Have you noticed that there are never many items of interest in the new and future  DVD releases anymore. Why? Because studios are to scared or lazy to take a chance. It only seems to be about the bottom line and has little to do with studio prestige and proper promotion...They keep recycling  the same things in different formats or lumping programmes/movies already released along with others of the same genre as a package.

On the website [...] an article appeared on June 17th, 2006 stating that because of low sales of Murphy Brown-Season One they have no intention at all of releasing any more seasons of the Emmy winning show, ever!

In other reviews I have spoke of Warner's negligence and lack of integrity in other facets of DVD production and releases, so this does not surprise me in the least.

It's quite apparent that Warner Brothers has become a company whose only interest is the bottom line! From their cheap DVD cases made of cardboard to their disinterest in producing a quality product, it's evident that Warners only interest is to squeeze as much money out of the consumer as it can, and as cheaply as possible, thus treating the consumer as complete utter fools!

Some serious changes need to be made in upper management of the company if this is ever going to end!

Therefore I urge as many people as possible to do what I have done the past couple of years. A complete boycott of all Warners material in the theatre as well as on DVD! Let them eat it as they have made US all eat it in recent years with their childish, infantile marketing strategies geared to idiots! Don't give them the satisfaction of making money being lazy and incompetent! Make them get off their slacking butts and start WORKING for the money! Make 'em sweat!!

As to why the other seasons haven't (yet?) been released, my guess is that it has to do with the rights to the music used in the episodes. The same thing happened with Laverne and Shirley.

I remember when it took Seinfeld over three years to hit their stride. Fortunately, Murphy Brown got even better the remaining seasons, with solid writing and a great supporting cast!!!

She just had a natural chemistry with each and every one of her co-stars, which seem to come across so easily. One of my favorite episodes was when Corky got married and Murphy had to wear that oversized hideous bridesmaid dress!!! Too funny!

To me,""Murphy Brown"" is the best American TV comedy/drama series ever made. I rate it only below the British series ""As Time Goes By"". The way the writers and actors present the combination of camaraderie and competition in the workplace is entertaining, insightful and addictive! Especially since the main character is a strong, successful and attractive career woman.

It helps, of course, that Candice Bergen is beautiful and wears an array of the most attractive clothes, which gave mature women like me some wardrobe ideas. But this is not the main attraction of the series, and indeed of Murphy Brown, the character. I love the ensemble acting, with the main characters so well cast, that over the years when I watched this series from Malaysia, they have become like old friends.

My son and daughter, now in their late 20's, are similarly addicted to this series, ever since they started watching with me in the late 80's.

2190014,4,B0006N2EZA,"MURPHY BROWN was a revolutionary sitcom.  Never before on television had there been a character quite like Murphy Brown, an anti-hero, anti-establishment news journalist who went through secretaries like Kleenex, and told it like it was.  Candice Bergen was the perfect actress to bring to life this complex, flawed but yet ultimately captivating character.  The show was set in the bustling world of the FYI television newsroom in Washington.

At the start of the series, Murphy has just returned to work after spending a month in the Betty Ford Clinic.  She gets more than she bargained for when she learns that FYI has a new producer, Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud), who has just graduated from Harvard and is completely green when it comes to the no-holds-barred approach to news journalism which Murphy is accustomed to.  Murphy also finds herself at odds with Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford), a former Southern beauty queen who joined the regular news team during her absence.  Adding further complications is Murphy's household decorator Eldin (Robert Pastorelli).  And of course there are Murphy's news colleagues: anchorman Jim Dial (Charles Kimbrough) and reporter Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto).

Two of my favourite episodes in this set are ""Mama Said"", when Murphy's imperious mother Avery comes to visit (with Colleen Dewhurst in an Emmy-winning performance); and ""Moscow on the Potomac"" where Murphy meets her Russian equivalent, anchorwoman Vladia (Robin Strasser).

This well-presented box set includes all 22 episodes from the first season.  Extras include commentary with Candice Bergen on the first episode ""Respect""; and commentary with creator Diane English on ""The Summer of `77"".  There is also a brand-new retrospective documentary which includes recent interviews with Bergen, English, Charles Kimbrough, Faith Ford, Grant Shaud, Joe Regalbuto, director Barnet Kellman and several of the writers.

COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:

2190015,5,B0006N2EZA,I have been waiting and waitng for this show to be released. But only the first season? I need all the rest!!!,1134950400,7,110,4.045454545454546
2190016,5,B0006N2EZA,"For all those who lament the quality of current television, this not-so-little gem of a 90s sitcom reminds us of the standard that was: superb, crisp, smart, satirical writing, brilliant, role-owning acting, and most of all, genuine off-the-wall laughs.  Television and film are marked by their dearth of quality roles for women: it must be said, then, that the character of Murphy Brown is among the finest roles written for any actor, male or female, in the history of television: here is a woman who is fierce, ambitious, vulnerable, flawed, awkward, temperamental, beautiful, and above all, unforgettable.  There had never been a character quite like Murphy Brown on television (the comparisons to Mary Tyler Moore notwithstanding) and there has never been one like her since (the comparisons to Will & Grace's biting Karen Walker likewise notwithstanding).

Murphy is one of the all-time great sitcom characters, ranking right up there with Lucy, Mary Tyler Moore, Cliff Huxtable and Archie Bunker.  She expanded exponentially the idea of the female sitcom lead, paving the way for the younger, independent generation of single woman neuroses.  But more than any of the characters which followed her, Murphy was a giant presence on TV, a larger-than-life persona who tackled big issues in a big way.

The first five years of Murphy Brown were undoubtedly its most brilliant.  Indeed, many of the episodes produced during these years rank among the finest television ever made, a claim that is hard to make in the case of one of the most uneven television genres, The Sitcom.  Seasons 6 & 7 were eminently watchable and frequently hysterical, though the showed veered away from its topical nature toward more conventional storylines (Miles and Corky getting married is the most obvious example).  The show suffered a heavy deficit of creativity in seasons 8 and 9, most of the episodes resorting to the conventional sitcom formulae that elicited only longing for the gem that once was.  The final and tenth season saw the show tackle the issue of breast cancer, a feat reminiscent of the show's earlier pioneering topical comedy.  Though it would be wrong to say that Murphy Brown was able to recapture the glory of its early years, Season 10 was notable in its own right.

Candice Bergen was outright genius in the titular role.  Here is a perfect example of perfect casting.  With five Emmy wins for Best Actress, Candice Bergen literally owned this role and made Murphy Brown one of the most dynamic, multi-faceted, substantial and resoundingly hilarious characters ever to appear on television.  One of the reasons the show worked for so long was that though it centered around the character of Murphy it was not simply an extension of it.  The supporting cast was a cadre of well-defined and powerful foibles set with and against Murphy.  As Murphy's boss, Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) was a perfect feeble foil for Murphy's aggressive sarcasm.  Murphy never took Miles too seriously and Miles almost always took Murphy too seriously.  The relationship between these two was sort of an inversion of the relationship between Mary Richards and Lou Grant.  Grant Shaud left the show at the end of the eighth season and it was never quite the same afterwards, though Lily Tomlin came aboard as the new executive producer Kay Carter Shepley.  There really was nothing like seeing these two try to manipulate the other into doing what they wanted.  Charles Kimbrough is an immensely gifted actor who is suited to the tee for the serious anchorman that is Jim Dial.  Jim was the only one who held any kind of sway over Murphy but he was one of the main sources of unexpected comedy on the show.  One of the great episodes of the show is ""Male Call"" where Jim, Frank and Miles all attend a Male Bonding Seminar to get in touch with their inner feelings.  Watching Jim, a stuffy Edward R. Murrow type old school newsman, slowly break down into tears as he recounts his father's cold behavior is truly hilarious.  As Corky Sherwood, Faith Ford underwent the most dramatic changes of any of the cast.  Early on she was simply a bizarre and cute dimwit (sort of the Anti-Murphy) who longed to be more Murphy-esque.  Later, she transformed into her own persona, a sleek and aggressive force that retained her innate sweetness and southern manners.  Corky never quite equaled Murphy for tenacity but she very much nearly leveled the playing ground between them as reporters.  Murphy's only real competition at work was Frank (Joe Regalbuto), a daring field reporter but an emotional klutz and a neurotic disaster who also happens to be Murphy's best friend.  Eldin, Murphy's house painter played by the late Robert Pastorelli, was the conscience of the show who gifted the frequently overbearing heroine some sage advice a la Jiminy Cricket.  Pat Corley played Phil, owner of the local pub restaurant that the FYI team frequented and father confessor of all the seedy goings-on in Washington.  Other frequent players on the show were Gary Marshall as Stan Lansing, the snarling President of CBS, his nephew Andrew (a most bizarre and hilarious whacko essayed by Paul Reubens a.k.a. Pee Wee Herman), and Chris Rich as Miller Redfield, journalistic ditz extraordinaire.  The show was also famous for Murphy's endless line of incompetent and hopeless secretaries who never did anything to help her and everything to aggravate her.

Think it's the case of most people who buy DVD, not just to this show, but to other classics TV programs.  You never knew how surprise I was when I saw that vertical blue line coming back from time to time.  More surprise was some of the scene were not even properly handled, I guess they just forgot to fix the color and enhance the clarity.  It's really pain to see how people disrespect the show.  I really want to see all ten seasons to be released in DVD.  But if such bad quality were going on to happen in the second seasons (if there was a chance to be released), I am afraid the series won't have enough sales support to the third season.",1128556800,16,737,4.006849315068493

Other shows have had 2-3 seasons released in that time frame. Murphy Brown was a cultural phemomenon, why the dragging of the feet when it comes to releasing other seasons.  Am I going to be in an old age home before I can buy all of the seasons? WB needs to hurry up, us MB fans are getting anxious!",1127174400,19,469,3.978723404255319

Yet worst of all, None of the characters on this show have a solid and unique personality. They're all neurotic with a twist of lime. You've got the neurotic Betty Ford reject, the neurotic investigative reporter, the neurotic-yet-steadfast newscast veteran, the neurotic young go-getter, and the neurotic former beauty pageant queen.

In fact, I'm sure of it, because quite a few of them still go over my head. But, I love the show. I've watched all 22 episodes that come in this first season DVD, and I'm hooked again. There is something about the writing that makes me really enjoy every episode. I feel like it's an educational sitcom. Not necessarily because I'm learning to dislike Dan Quayle, but because the writers write UP to an audience, and not down. How many sitcoms do that? This is a terrific one! Candice Bergen was my first crush, and now I'm about to marry a wonderful intelligent woman of my own. Perhaps Murphy Brown led me to that? Regardless, what a wonderful sitcom! If you're thinking about, do it. You'll love it. And with a featurette that includes present-day interviews with the cast, wow, it's a wonderful take-you-back experience.",1115856000,15,994,4.527777777777778

There are 22 episodes and bonus material including 2 episodes that can be watched with editorial from the producer.

They go through how they casted the show, the importance of specific shows, the political feel of the times and how it compares to today, how some storylines were born...etc.  This was a great sitcom.

Murphy Brown is an amazing character and I'm just thrilled that season 1 has finally been released on DVD. It's nearly impossible to find a strong female lead character on television. In fact, there are only a handful of shows centered around a female character in television history. Murphy was empowered, smart, single and happy. She was always inspirational and always hillarious. Plus the supporting cast was fantastic. You should definitely treat yourself to this DVD set.",1109376000,4,650,5.08411214953271
2190033,5,B0006N2EZA,"At long last!  Thank you Warner Home Video for your long-awaited release of the classic television series ""Murphy Brown"" on DVD.  I hope that Warner will see fit to release the entire series on DVD.

""Murphy Brown"" is one of the finest television series ever made.  I am so grateful to Nickelodeon for rebroadcasting this classy, still relevant comedy series which courageously and consistently displayed a SOCIAL CONSCIENCE within witty, sophisticated repartee impeccably delivered by a gifted and very appealing ensemble cast.

And what can one say about the beautiful Candice Bergen who embodied the intelligent, gutsy, rough-on-the-outside/soft-on-the-inside (except when it came to exposing crooks and phonies) title character of Murphy Brown?  She is unequivocally brilliant in the role.  Bergen invests this unforgettable character with the complexity and depth she so richly deserves.

Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, a conservative or a liberal, ""Murphy Brown"" tackled issues which should concern all of us.  Government corruption and waste; the damaging effects of pollution to our environment, wildlife, and ultimately to ourselves; the difficulties and challenges of single parenthood (And no, I do NOT advocate single parenthood.  However, it is a reality that needs to be dealt with); gender discrimination; TV network politics and ratings games:  these are timeless issues that still deserve our serious attention.

To everyone involved in the creation and production of ""Murphy Brown"", thank you for your brave and thought-provoking series which tackled difficult issues with humor, grace, and humanity.  This is one registered Republican viewer who is forever indebted to you!",1109289600,7,1705,5.587548638132295

2190035,5,B0006N2EZA,"I remembered watching a few episodes back in the 90s of this series, the character of Murphy Brown was very funny to me since she was a mature woman always cranking but in a way that make it very funny.
Now with the release of the Complete First Season we can enjoy the first 22 episodes of the series, including the pilot episode that won Emmys for Camera and Writing. Candice Bergan also won this season the first of her five Emmys for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, well deserved I might add.
For 21 dollars this set is a bargain, you will watch one episode after another in a single seating (well that's what I did) since the series is very funny and all the character are very likable in their own particular way.
To be honest I am not very expert with the quality of the DVDs, I just hope to buy a series and enjoy it, that's the way I gred these sets, and this one has 5 stars since it was not expensive, made me laugh and made me expecting complete my collection.
This was the first of 10 seasons that Murphy Brown had, from 1988-1989 season, won a total of 4 Emmys.

As a extras we have two audio commentaries, one by Candice Bergen in the Pilot episode (that runs 27 mins) and one by the Series Creator Diane English. Also there is a retrospective of the series that is very interesting and entertaining.",1108771200,11,1316,4.264
2190036,3,B0006N2EZA,"I'm surprised that so far the other review that comments on the poor picture quality in this collection has received mostly ""not helpful"" ratings.  Do people really not care about picture quality?

I concur with that negative review:  I love the show and am enjoying the material, but I am surprised at how bad some of the scenes look.  The last scene of the first episode has several vertical, colored lines running across the screen.  Another episode has a similar problem at the beginning.  One episode has a scene where some of the close ups look good but others look like they are out of focus.

I'm not sure what was done to transfer this material to dvd, but it is by far the worst handling of the transfer of classic tv to dvd that I've yet seen -- and I have a LOT of dvd's of old tv shows.

I don't expect perfection for the price (this set is certainly less expensive than many other 4-disc sets), but it seems like they could have done a bit better than they did in preparing these discs for release.",1108512000,88,1012,4.345744680851064
2190037,5,B0006N2EZA,"I love Murphy Brown, and I say this as a socially conservative Republican.  After Seinfeld and Family Guy, it is one of my favorite sitcoms.  Frankly, I think Quayle should have applauded her for taking the hard choice of raising the kid the best she could.  The character does not abort him, but takes the choice filled with difficulty.  In my world, that is a positive lesson, not something negative about the breakdown of the family.

Murphy Brown is a great comedy that, much like the short-lived Sports Night, makes you think.  It brings up issues and gets you to use your brain at the same time you take a break from the day's work for a laugh. This is not a show that will contribute to the rotting of brain cells.

You get to see the fast pace of the newsroom and the great human drama and wonderful interaction between the characters.

The stories are so interesting, it is definitely worth getting this DVD.

I am a tightwad, but I had to spend my money on this set.  If you are even a slight fan of this show, get the DVD set.  If you don't, they may not offer future seasons.  If there are not the sales worth producing future seasons, they won't produce them.

Buy this DVD.  For twenty bucks, the cost of two meals at Applebee's, it is certainly worth it.",1107993600,15,1269,4.367521367521367
