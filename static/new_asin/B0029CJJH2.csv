Who cares its just so funny in a characterization type of way. This collection is excellent value. Drawing as it does on the two writers wartime experience and set in India it's incomparable.",1305676800,,325,4.927272727272728
8357695,5,B0029CJJH2,"This DVD set was a gift for a couple who loved this television show while it was being broadcasted. They never expected to be able to watch it on DVD-- YEARS later!! Although I have only seen an episode or two of It Ain't Half Hot Mum' I must say, if people remember loving it-- they will love it again. It was such a joy to see them laugh and smile while viewing this (foreign to me) show!",1290384000,,390,4.012820512820513
