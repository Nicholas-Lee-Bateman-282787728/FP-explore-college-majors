That is my favorite part. You have to buy it just to see that part. There is also this wierd part where they are interviewing the principle of leo's high school and the guy keeps calling him ""leonard"" isn't that wierd? The guy doesnt even know his name! Anyway you have to buy it!!!!",1210809600,,445,4.068181818181818
