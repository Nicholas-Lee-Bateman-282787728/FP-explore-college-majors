8240637,1,B00115R2TA,"I have the ""This is the Sea"" videos and was expecting a similar type video with Pacific Horizons. Unfortunately something was missing, the video definitely has some cool sequences - eg the flat spin at Skook in a sea kayak but the general video narration was - people telling you over and over again that sea kayaking is fantastic. Yes I know, thats why I bought the video to see some cool scenery and kayaking on the north west coast to get some inspiration on planning trips there. It looks like they just didn't get enough good video sequences and when they put it together it was too short so they used a lot of filler material. Generally disappointing.",1203465600,3,657,4.529411764705882
