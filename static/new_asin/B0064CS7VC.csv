Each episode (I think it has 10 - I haven't watched it yet, but I do know the show's content from tv) is comprised of three bakeries (some are in several episodes) working on a specific cake and you get to watch pieces of cake and other edibles turn into these masterpieces, it's truly ""amazing"". Some are more astounding than others, but they're all works of art. Extremely impressive and for me I find it greatly enjoyable and entertaining. For those who want to learn - you can definitely pick up some good tricks and pointers here.",1459382400,,765,4.34965034965035
