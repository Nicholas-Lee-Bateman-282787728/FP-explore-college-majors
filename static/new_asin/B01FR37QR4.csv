The stray dog from the first film which became Maya's pet, is still around though, even though it hasn't aged a day and the monkey, just like it did in the last film, sneaks inside her suitcase.  Maya who got into the veterinary degree course at San Francisco University has just watched her welcome pack and become extremely disappointed with the course since it won't have her interacting with an animal for years.  She clearly had done no research into her chosen future career.  After talking a smelly old lady's cat out of a tree (the smelly part according to the cat) and getting on the news, a Paris Hilton reality TV celebrity type turns up at her house and wants her to fly on her private jet to LA and talk to her doggy who refuses to get out of its bed and tell her why it is being grumpy all the time.  She does, but the reality star's agent has plans to cash in on Maya and to do so needs her to stay in LA.  Of course she promised her mother in return for letting her go that she'd be flying back the next morning, but the promise of lunch with a cute boy who used to be in some TV show she loved, means Maya's going to disobey her mother once again.

This is honestly a pretty bad movie.  There's not a lot of talking to the animals interaction.  This is more of a what does a teen learn out this experience to become a better person movie.",1534550400,,1519,4.189003436426117
