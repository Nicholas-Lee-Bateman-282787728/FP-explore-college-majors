8193367,1,B000PUAIMU,"This is a series of 2 films. A man gets scratched by a radioactive cat and develops strength and the ability to light cigarettes with his laser eyes. He battles against a group of jungle thugs led by a Satan worshiper with a stick that shoots fire. People run around and beat each other up for no apparent reason while the bad guys talk about taking over the county (Thailand?) and then the world.

In the second episode, the remaining gang attempts to get a nuclear starter, whatever that is.

The films are poorly dubbed, almost to the point you were wondering if they didn't change the film. Guns would fire whenever someone would simply carry a gun, no pulling of trigger required. The martial arts aspect was more comical than serious. The same dubbed noise was made if someone punch the face or a body's soft part. The tales are idiotic. The cartoon front is a deception. These are not kid movies.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, pre-rape activities. No nudity.",1361491200,,960,4.635294117647059
