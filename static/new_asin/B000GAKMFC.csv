8129758,4,B000GAKMFC,"One man's meat is another man's poison.  The sexploitation films from 1980 are one of the best genres out of Mexico.
Campy with sex and nudity- totally wholesome in my opinion. Only four stars because ""Chile picante"" is too short.",1343779200,5,230,4.75
8129759,1,B000GAKMFC,"It's difficult to believe that this film was filmed in the same place where Luis Bunuel, Arturo de Cordova, German Valdez, Pedro Infante, and the Soler brothers.  It's a low class, vulgar, degenerate, and non-inventive waste of time.
The sad thing is that this is the type of film that dominated the mexican movie industry in that period.",1236470400,5,338,4.827586206896552
