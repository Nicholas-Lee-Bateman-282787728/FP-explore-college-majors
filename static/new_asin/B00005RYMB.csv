8218354,3,B00005RYMB,"They don't make them like this one anymore, unfortunately. This is a Mystique Films release from 1998, made for the Playboy Channel. It has the high production values, sophisticated (in genre context) plot and good acting typical of these films. However,  it doesn't bowl you over with sexuality and gets very ho-hum due to the small cast.

Only three actresses, and one of those has only one scene. The other two, Catalina Laranaga and Kim Yates,  are very familiar faces (and bodies) to anybody who has seen many of these films.  I wouldn't consider them to be top-shelf soft-core actresses although I know that some would disagree with me. And  neither of them  get explicit.  Lots and lots of toplessness, and Laranaga is fully nude  more often than not, but  unlike the Playboy releases of say 2000-2002, you don't get to see those startling, wonderful shots of the nether regions.

Because we're just seeing the same two women naked over and over again, and because neither of them are getting too graphic about it, this movie and its hour-and-forty-minute runtime gets boring less than halfway through.

For those  of you actually interested enough to wonder what it's about,  ""Loveblind"" doesn't tell you anything (and really doesn't fit the  film at all): It's about  a  photographer (Bobby Johnston), his  old college friend and publisher (Eric  Acsell), the friend's fiancee  (Yates) and a newfound model (Laranaga). If  you've  seen any of these movies you probably can guess the plot--coupling, copulation  and in the end,  sweetness.

I  can't really recommend this because I personally was wanting more than it provided, but if  you're not  as  experienced with these films you might enjoy it.",1389484800,2,1708,5.003571428571429
8218355,2,B00005RYMB,"The copy I got was the cut version. I know because I remember the naughty bits from this movie from back when. But every time anything started it went to the next scene. Virtually no nudity in my copy. A shame, I really like Kim Yates.",1303257600,2,235,4.130434782608695
8218356,5,B00005RYMB,"I'll be honest. I got bored with the story pretty quickly on this one and ended up fast forwarding through everything but the sex scenes. It appeared to be one of those ones where the mysterious, beautiful woman walks out the beach in her wet t-shirt, stays with a bunch of people for a few days and teaches them all how to drop their inhibitions and live out their sexual fantasies. And I think there was a love story in there somewhere as well. But nobody was actually blind.

There are eight sex scenes. Seven are boy/girl. In three of those the girl is Kim Yates, in three others, it's Catalina Larranaga, and one has Nancy O'Brien. There is one girl/girl scene with Kim and Catalina. All scenes are great. They've got some really nice sets and the cinematography is excellent. This is a good movie for Kim Yates and/or Catalina Larranaga fans. You get to see a lot of them and both are gorgeous. Since Catalina plays the part of a photographer's model, there are also three non-sex scenes where Catalina shows off her body. One of those scenes also includes Kim.

This movie could have been shortened and paced better and probably kept me away from the fast forward button. But it really delivered in the sex and nudity department, so I have no problem recommending it.",1105920000,5,1274,4.558951965065503
