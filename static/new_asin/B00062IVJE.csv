2161817,5,B00062IVJE,"Sherlock Holmes will forever enchant those who appreciate the

wonders of mystery and suspense. The Hound of the Baskervilles

holds dear memories for me, both in English and Spanish. As a child,

I heard ""El Mastn de los Baskervilles"" as a radio program, back in

Cuba. When I learned English, it was one of the first books I acquired

and read. While the movie is a comedy, seeing the movie was an awesome

experience for me, and now owning the DVD... is simply a dream come true.

The acting is rather funny. The interpretation... a bit silly, but enjoyable.

The episode is one of the best ever written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.",1163030400,,633,4.539823008849558
2161818,1,B00062IVJE,"Buyer Beware -
I won't comment in detail on the quality of this movie, Paul Morrissey was/is an awful director but the cast of ""Hound"" clearly directed themselves and, left to their own devices, what they came up with was a compendium of their tried and trusted comedy routines (much loved by UK theatre and television audiences through the years). In this sense, as a permanent record of Kenneth Williams, Dud and Pete, Max Wall, Irene Handl et al, the movie is a delight to own - but after amazon replaced a faulty disc - guess what ? The replacement has the same flaw - it freezes in the middle of Dud and Pete's hilarious ""medium"" scene (and probably in other places too but the disc freezes so completely you can't GET to other scenes). Double-sided discs seem vulnerable to technical trouble and my question is this - why the HELL do studios even contemplate putting a ""full frame"" version of a movie on side 2 of ANY disc ? Who on earth wants to see a dreadful pan-and-scan version of a widescreen movie ? The letterboxed side would have been all I wanted except - that's the side that has the flaw ! Obviously a faulty pressing and who knows how many of these flawed discs are out there ? Be careful !",1155859200,16,1209,4.401785714285714
2161819,5,B00062IVJE,This is the only satire version of the story I have found.  Most of the gags are verbal.  One is the cripples flocking to the shrine.  They are described as flocking cripples.  Another favorite is the deduction by Watson that a painting was done by the artist before he died.  Sherlock points out the difficulty of his doing the painting after death.,1144108800,,350,4.580645161290323

Some very funny moments, not least when Denholm Elliot's chihuahua urinates for about 3 minutes all over Dr Watson (played by Dud).

2161883,1,B00062IVJE,"The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1978 film

Three French nuns visit Sherlock Holmes to find a missing relic. Holmes explains his methods to find the thief. [Yes, this is a comedy.] There is a visit from Dr. Mortimer, who explains the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles and the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. They will meet the heir and go to Dartmoor. [Their behavior becomes tiring quickly.] Sir Henry returns to Baskerville Hall with Dr. Watson. Mrs. Barrymore shows them to a small bedroom - with standing water! Holmes visits a massage spa and meets ladies. Barrymore is flashing with the moors code at night. Holmes leaves that spa to visit his mother. This table doesnt hear too well. [The story drags on. So too the actors.] Who wrote this abomination? They deserve this flop. They cant do comedy or drama.

Watson meets Frankland who talks about hunting. He meets his daughter too. Holmes meets Spigot, a one-legged man, who wants the job of a runner. [Is this really funny?] Will he fall down on the job? Watson meets Stapleton and his sister. There is an auction of the contents of Baskerville Hall to pay the wages of the Barrymores. Is one picture a clue to the Hound? That night they go to dinner and walk over the moor. The likely suspects are gathered around the dinner table. A little dog is on the table (for comic effect). The hound follows Sir Henry. Some fall into the pit. [A pit stop?] Sherlock reads the will. Will the guilty party sink any lower? The Barrymores will migrate to Kentucky to raise chickens and potatoes. Then they show the actors and their roles. The cheers at the end are the most honest part of this movie.

Those who copy and distort an original story are not skilled enough to create their own. Yes, there are some who can copy an existing style to create new stories. This is not one of them. A. Conan Doyle was interested in criminology and must have used actual crimes as the basis for his stories (written over a century ago). If you read them in High School read them again to see what details you missed. Silver Blaze is one example, there are others.",1415404800,,2106,4.536842105263158

2161887,3,B00062IVJE,"You'll have to be an ardent fan of Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore to enjoy this film. The script is awash with awful puns and crass visual jokes. Sherlock Holmes(Peter Cooke) wanders arounds looking disdainful
and adopts a thick jewish accent for the part. Watson(Dudley Moore)gets the larger part of the movie and puts in some excellent moments. His scene as Holmes clairvoyant mother is Dudley at his best. Good support roles. Joan Greenwood does a marvellous spoof of the Exorcist. Kenneth Williams,Terry Thomas,Max Wall,Irene Handel all do their best to lift this flagging script into the realms of comedy. For those of you who want to waste their valuable time this is a must.",1382486400,,679,4.913043478260869
2161888,3,B00062IVJE,"I was very young when Cook and Moore were at their peak, so the humour for me is rather dated. However, this is a top-flight production in terms of pre-CGI production values. To quote Dickie Attenborough: 'spared no expense...'.

It is also a top-flight British supporting cast, featuring a who's who of comedic talent, including Prunella Scales (Sybil of Fawlty Towers fame), and a hilarious cameo from the one and only Spike Milligan (The Goons).

It is less a film than a series of set pieces, with some of the jokes telegraphed a few hundred kilometres in advance. But there are some genuinely inspired moments involving for example Kenneth Williams.

There are also some famous sketches, such as the one-legged interviewee, with Dudley Moore completely unrecognisable.

The highlight for me was their lampooning of The Exorcist (the original film) - it is still both pretty off and also hilarious.

Denholm Elliot (Harrison Ford's older pal in Raiders of the Lost Ark) also puts in an inspired cameo with a Chihuahua that let's say has an incontinence issue.

But one has to try to place oneself back in the time in which it was made - this would make it both somewhat appalling, hilarious and/or awful depending on your taste.

Comedy these days by many artists tend to go for maximum shock, and often toilet humour without any finesse (if there is ever any finesse in toilet humour, I am not sure) - in Cook and Moore's time comedy was as much about the sight gag and physical comedy as it was about what anyone said (or did not say).

Timing was and still is everything, as is playing it straight in patently ridiculous situations.

Needless to say, Cook and Moore were legends at such comedy - whether or not it transfers to a full-length feature film is I guess a matter of personal taste.

It is easy to I suppose look back on such efforts given what has come since, however some of the scenes are still inspired, rather uncomfortable, and even downright off (foul).

I will take a punt and say neither Cook nor Moore had much time for the British aristocracy, using the vehicle of this Sherlock Holmes chestnut to run rampart.

Dudley Moore is the standout - his one-legged applicant skit is a marvel, and it probably wouldn't have worked without Peter Cook as the other half.

I enjoyed this overall, however it is not probably something I would give a repeat viewing.",1372636800,3,2381,4.694711538461538
2161889,1,B00062IVJE,This is NOT the movie that is advertised. Amazon needs to monitor their movies more carefully. Other than that  the movie is probably OK.,1364860800,,137,4.708333333333333
2161890,3,B00062IVJE,"No coherent ""plot"" can be found lurking in this broad 1978 spoof of Conan Doyle's detecting duo, but hundreds of silly jokes and gags coming at you like handfuls of confetti could mean that at least a few will connect with your funnybone.

Peter Cook is amusing as a farcical Sherlock Holmes who occasionally goes home to his mum for food and to have his clothes washed, and Dudley Moore is clever in three separate roles (as Watson, as Holmes's mum, and as the piano player who provides music for the film). An array of well known British comedy actors and actresses - Denholm Elliott, Spike Mulligan, Terry-Thomas, Roy Kinnear, Penelope Keith, Joan Greenwood, Jesse Matthews - add to the general merriment. And then, too, British actress/blues singer Dana Gillespie offers a pair of unusual visual bonuses to round out the film.

The other reviews of this movie seem to be sharply divided, which shows that different folks enjoy (or hate) different jokes. To me, the funniest part of the film was when a tiny dog was peeing steadily on Doctor Watson for about four minutes, but to my wife this was ""crass humor,"" aka ""it's a guy thing.""

Maybe this loopy parody would be funniest for people watching it together with a six-pack or two. Certainly it has to be funnier to people who've already seen at least one or two other film versions of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, preferably Basil Rathbone's (1939) and/or Peter Cushing's (1959) earlier ones.",1364688000,,1451,4.772908366533865

However I live in New Zealand and the region for the DVD is North America so I can't play it on my DVD player. I can play it on my laptop but the reason I bought the DVD was to play it on our DVD player. I guess it's my own fault for overlooking the regional restrictions on DVDs but it is irritating.

Do I blame Amazon? I suppose not since I should have figured this out myself but anyone else (who don't purchase stuff on the internet very frequently) should consider this before buying DVDs from North America if you don't live there. My main reason for buying is that it's very difficult to get this video any more and I had a nostalgic wish to see Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in what I think is a very funny takeoff on Sherlock Holmes (incidently I also love reading the original Conan Doyle books).

The only thing that really dates this movie is a blatant parody of a scene from The Exorcist.
