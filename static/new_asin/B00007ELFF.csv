1807618,5,B00007ELFF,"When I first heard about this film, I thought, ""Harris and Quinn?""  How will they pull it off?  For one thing, there was the item of physical non-resemblance.  But with the addition of a little nose putty, I was suprised to be able to see Lennon quite easily in Harris.  Quinn's physical resemblance to McCartney is even more remote (you can add putty to a nose but you can't perform rhinoplastic reduction with makeup!), but factor in the clothes and hair and he comes closer.  But it's the body language and speech which make him convincing.  I didn't notice in the credits if there was a vocal coach, but if there was, he/she knows his/her stuff.  If the actors developed their own accents and cadences, that's even more to their credit.  They obviously studied these men assiduously.  In some scenes I found myself feeling horribly sentimental, being of a ""certain age.""  The picture is nicely staged, paced, and photographed.  Entertaining start to finish.",1075939200,23,961,4.8343558282208585
1807619,5,B00007ELFF,"A must-see for all Beatles fans.  This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't exactly resemble Lennon; his mannerisms, expressions, posture, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether Paul McCartney & Wings' ""Silly Love Songs"" is worthy of #1 status in America.",1075420800,4,426,5.173913043478261
1807620,5,B00007ELFF,"The movie started out very intersting and at the end, I wanted it to go on forever!  Quinn and Harris portrayed John and Paul so well, I forgot they were just great, under-rated actors!  I think that John and Paul had one of the best, most interesting friendships of the century and this movie certianly portryed that!  Harris did everything I've seen John do, the slang, the gestures and silliness.  A must see for any Beatle fan!!!",1060905600,4,433,4.584415584415584
1807621,5,B00007ELFF,"There is nothing revealed in this movie that the average Beatles fan doesn't already know. But Quinn shines in his portrayal of Paul McCartney. Literally EVERYTHING he says sounds like a question: ""You're looking well?"", ""Let's go for a walk?"". HYSTERICAL!",1056326400,3,256,5.2682926829268295
1807622,5,B00007ELFF,"This movie is exceptional in every way.  The actors are completely committed, and I fully believed I was watching Lennon and McCartney interact.  Furthermore--and something people have yet to mention--the screenplay is loaded with details of these two men from the period in which the movie takes place and written with a palpable warmth and love for John and Paul without being syrupry, cliched, or sentimental.  As a die hard Beatles fan who has read more than 40 books on these two geniuses, this was the movie I had always wanted to see.  The experience stayed with me for days.  I waited for a long time to see the release of this film on DVD.",1048118400,5,648,4.6
1807623,5,B00007ELFF,"This movie will touch the hearts of any Beatles fan. The two actors who portray Lennon & McCartney really nailed down the personaltities, if not, on some occasions ... their appearance. Going back to '76 .. a time when there was still that possibility of the Beatles getting back together .. we still had John, we still had George. This infamous meeting has been mentioned in books .. All throughout the '70s .. we never even saw a picture of John & Paul together! This movie is a real treat .. it's like taking that trip back in time & never wanting it to end. You want to go back & spend another day with your heroes ... you want history to be changed .. you want to GET BACK to where you once belonged!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! It really feels like you are witnessing John & Paul together again in a chance meeting in '76.",1044835200,4,822,4.309677419354839

1807625,5,B00007ELFF,"I rented this movie in Mexico while living there in the year 2001, and have been searching for it ever since returning to the States! I highly recommend it to any fan of the Beatles. 'What would it have been like if Paul and John got together after the break up of the Beatles?' Director, Michael Lindsay-Hogg will keep you 'glued' to the screen through the entire movie!  I didn't want the movie to end, and now I think about it all the time.. it moved me that much, and will move you too!  It's a timeless work into the minds of two of the greatest poets of our time and their minds like you have never known before.",1037404800,5,618,4.184873949579832

1807660,1,B00007ELFF,I can never see this happening. I don't understand all the good reviews cause this was simply stupid in my opinion. This is probably what we would all like to believe happened but history tells us a much different story.  What happened to the part where Paul returns the next day guitar in hand only to be told to go away by Lennon? Stop trying to make Lennon a nice guy during these years cause he wasn't. I like truth in a movie.,1418774400,,431,4.192771084337349

1807664,5,B00007ELFF,"A parody of Lennon and McCartney true.....but it is still a great film....I love it because it is about two friends, true friends, who seem to lose each other, but come back together. so it is just a charming film, one to be loved and seen at least once.",1409097600,,254,4.204081632653061

1807686,5,B00007ELFF,"I've been a fan of The Beatles for quite some time. Their music is a huge part of my life, and I am sure that it is the same for many of you.

This movie takes place in New York, 1976. While it's a fictional movie because it presents a reunion between John and Paul that didn't happen (at least not that way) I think it captures perfectly well their relationship. The most interesting thing is that while, as I said, this didn't happen, the dialogues presented in a movie are taken from interviews that John and Paul did themselves, so in the end the script writer took their very own words and managed to make of those excerpts an incredible dialogue between the two beatles.

I absolutely recommend this movie.",1399161600,5,712,4.427480916030534

1807688,4,B00007ELFF,While the guy who played John was an excellent candidate as far as looking like him he was some what shorter than the real John 'his voice some what dampens the mood of the movie also being as the vocal tone was no where near Lennons.

1807692,5,B00007ELFF,"I have read a ton on the lives of the Beatles dating back to when they were kids, through their fantastic journey in changing the music world and their breakup.  I have to say this is the best because it takes two iconic figures, breaks them down and brings them to earth.  It dispenses with ""Beatle Mania"" and all the fancy wrappings.  It's not so much about them as Beatles, but as two best friends who've had their friendship ripped asunder being Beatles.",1354752000,2,458,4.493975903614458

1807694,5,B00007ELFF,"It's easy to react with an ""oh great"" when hearing about this kind of movie expecting it to be ridiculous and a poor quality film. Honestly, I watched it a few times. I really enjoyed this. I was pleasantly surprised and I think it will satisfy Beatles fans who still mourn over the Lennon/McCartney breakup. But knowing Lennon did, in fact, tell a friend on the night he died that he loved Paul and would do anything for him is just as satisfying as this film. I recommend to any fan.",1339977600,2,485,4.34065934065934
1807695,2,B00007ELFF,"This movie is one long cliche after another. First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation ""it was always just the Two Of Us""! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either. Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something along the lines of ""Sure and while I croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin"". That made me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. Forget it.",1308528000,4,1141,4.464114832535885
1807716,2,B00007ELFF,"This movie is an amusing piece of fiction. The actors do a pretty good job channeling the personas of Lennon and McCartney, and giving obsessed fans a happier ending than ever was. The entire enterprise is strange; so beloved are the Beatles, that some fans must sit around imagining how wonderful it would be if John and Paul had made up completely in the seventies, palled around with feeling, ran around Central Park like schoolboys in ""A Hard Day's Night,"" sang together, etc. Fans take it all so personally. Can we not love the Beatles warts and all, as genuine flawed human beings who never entirely conformed to our image of what they ought to be and do? Must they be the friendly mop tops forever? The second half of Lennon's life was a difficult struggle against that image and the expectations of fame in general. Here all that is cheerily kicked aside, because the public would rather he had made peace with his old partner. Okay, there is some complexity in this film, and it isn't a hack job, but the underlying premise remains unsettling to me. This film does not claim to be fact, but the real history was so interesting that I don't like fictional rewrites of that history. Read Lennon's fascinating ""Playboy"" interviews from 1980 and you will get a much truer picture of this situation late in Lennon's life. Rest assured, this is pure fiction, and frankly kinda weird. Here is the heart-to-heart chat they never had; what are we supposed to do when we wake up from this dream? The dream is over, mate. If we want to enjoy the Beatles, we can always revisit work from their genuine collaboration in the sixties. If we want to enjoy the ex-Beatles, perhaps we could take them on their own terms.",1307491200,3,1711,4.613114754098361

1807719,5,B00007ELFF,"This movie sneaks up on you. I started not really liking this movie, feeling they could have used better actors. Especially Harris' portrayal of John Lennon.  Didn't really sound like John. Sure, he did a very passable scouse accent, but his personification was nasaly without the high tenor of John's voice. Quinn as Paul as well could have been better I thought. Yeah, he had Paul's hair style, but facially does not particularly resemmble Paul at all. But as the movie progressed I was involved, engrossed, and then enthralled. Harris and Quinn I discovered, and you will too when you view the film, captured the essence of John and Paul as we know them and in all liklihood accurately captured in essence what went on during that fateful meeting.

Quinn's personification of Lennon is dead on, as is Paul's interpretation of Paul, particularly how Harris captured Lennon's attitude and how Quinn captures Paul's mannerisms. More importantly, they both accurately reflected the bare inner essence of each musician: John, who displayed a hard exterior, but inside was a very vulnerable and wounded person; Paul, all sweetness and cutsiness outside, but inside hard as nails and solid as the Rock of Gibralter.

The dialogue sounds authentic. As the disclaimer of the movie states, this is a piece of fiction. The only people who knows what was said and what went on during that meeting are John and Paul, and I don't think Paul will say. The dialogue rings true, however, because parts of the dialogue appear to be based on the public pronouncements of the characters made in interviews and other public statements. That's OK. The movie is utterly authentic in portraying the milieu of mid-70's America. The mythology of that meeting says that late that night they  decided to appear at Saturday Night Live, but as we all know, never did. The aftermath of that decision, their indecision, the stage fright, the doubts and finally, their decision not to appear, all seems very very authentic and totally believeable.

The movie pays attention to detail. When Paul has first knocked on John's door he is still sporting an ascot worn in the beginning of the film. Realizing he is about to meet his old band-mate, he jerks the ascot off his neck. This little scene comes across as a completely human reaction. There are many little flourishes in this movie.

I compare the movie to ""My Dinner with Andre."" You don't have to be a Beatle fan, a John fan, a Paul fan, or whatever, to enjoy this movie. It should be seen by all.",1295827200,,2522,4.812933025404157
1807720,4,B00007ELFF,"This was an enjoyable dipiction of one day in their life.  Many of the facts are documented and many are stretched for drama sake.

I wasn't too pleased with the choice of Aidan Quinn as Paul.  He was a little over the top with the forced Liverpool accent sounding almost ""Yellow Submarinish.""

1807723,5,B00007ELFF,"I think Aidan Quinn (Paul McCartney), who I've appreciated in many different roles
down through the years, and Jared Harris (looks and acts like Lennon so much that
it's spooky at times!), did a wonderful job in this ""what-if"" movie that's supposedly
based on an actual impromptu meeting between ex-Beatles / musical partners / friends
Paul McCartney and John Lennon in NYC in 1976.
In this movie, the Beatles have been broken up since 1970, and it wasn't
a nice clean break either!---Many hurt feelings and bruised egos.
After not speaking for six years and throwing barbs at each other in
interviews (well, John at least!), Paul, who is at the peak of his WINGS period,
is in NYC for 4 sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden when he decides to pay his
old friend / nemesis John Lennon at visit at The Dakota.
John has been basically out of the music game (with exceptions) since
the early 70's, and has moved to New York with Yoko Ono and they have a
small child together..Sean Lennon, who John is more than happy to dote on and
be the father and husband that he could never be back in his youth when oldest son
Julian was born and his first wife, Cynthia were together.
He basically likes hanging out and living the life that he wants to live,
free of being controlled by the madness of Beatlemania in the 60's, and he and Yoko's
protest period in the early 70's. He could give two hoots about the record business
at this point, and works only when he wants to.

Paul, on the other hand, loves being who he is and making music, which John chides
every chance he gets as ""Silly Love Songs"" and ""Nursery Rhymes"", much to Paul's chagrin.
These two start off cautious and cool towards each other....Paul more warm than John.
Slowly the ice begins to melt as they reminisce and re-connect.
They laugh and joke and play music and sing songs one minute, then are
in heated verbal fights the next, running the gamut of emotions you might
(ehh-hem!) imagine (forgive the pun!) them to feel after seeing each other for
the first time in six years.  (-:
They even go out on the town incognito, dressed in ridiculous derby hats and moustaches.
John, ever caustic and sardonic, really reams out a fan or two who recognize the two
in a restuarant and come over with Beatles-talk and making ridiculous demands.
The scene is hilarious, and seems like something that John may have actually done.
Overall, this is a great little flight of creative fancy which gives us an glimpse
of what might have really happened in this alleged and fateful reunion.
I found it to be engrossing, humorous in places, and very charming.
If you're into The Beatles, Paul McCartney and John Lennon, you'll love this!",1286928000,4,2683,4.5875

This movie may not be based on a true story, but it is still a great film anyway. It feels like a Beatles fan's fantasy of what it would have been like if the two really hung out for the entire day together again. It also gives me a sad feeling, which it does all fans, to see John and know what was going to happen to him in just a few years. Wish that part of his life could be re-written in reality. Anyway, this is a really touching film for the fans.",1246406400,2,582,3.8181818181818183

""Two of Us"" deals with the themes and issues that many Beatles fans may want to know about or interact with, and the film does an outstanding job of fairly dealing with these issues in a reasonable manner. I highly recommend ""Two of Us""",1170547200,2,583,4.471698113207547

In fact, it is so pleasant to watch, you wish it really did happen. No one really knows what happened when Paul rang up John and Joko's pad on that day in 1976, but I'm sure it was not so wonderful as this movie would suggest. It is best to treat this film as 'fiction' and go on daydreaming about how Paul and John could've been close friends again in the post-Beatles era.

The only flaw in the story was the Saturday Nite Live bit, where John tells Paul that the two should shock the world by showing up at the TV studio to play a few tunes. Paul then hesitates and says 'What if we stink?'. First of all, John never would have made that suggestion (it would have been Paul to suggest that), then in return, John would have hesitated and said 'What if we stink' instead of Paul. Thats my prediction.",1141776000,5,924,4.133333333333334
1807749,5,B00007ELFF,"This is probably the best piece of ""Beatles Fiction"" ever made- because it might actually have some truth to it.

""Two of us"" is a fictionalized account of a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, six years after the Beatles' official break up.

Paul shows up at the dakota one morning when Wings are in town and John isn't particulary thrilled to see him. After some initial awkwardness (which pops up again throughout the film when they talk about open wounds) they unexpectedly spend the day catching up, leading to an uneasy reconciliation (personal of course, not professional)

This movie is great because it not only captures John and Paul at this particular moment of their lives, (Aidan Quinn surprisingly plays Paul very well and Jared Harris as John is even better)but it also effectively captures the feeling of seeing an old friend who you may have outgrown but still love.

It also captured the feel of 1976 well for a low budget production and beatle fans will enjoy the little snippets of beatle lore in the script .(the saturday night live offer was great as were the stories of Ringo and George circa 1976)

The only thing that didn't ring true was Yoko's total absence- which was unlikely but probably dramatically necessary. After all, this was ""two of us"", not ""two of us and the one who ruined our friendship!""

It would be nice if an interviewer someday asked Paul McCartney if he has seen this film. I would love to hear Sir Paul's opinion of it!

1807750,5,B00007ELFF,"The 1976 day long reminiscent reunion of John Lennon and Paul McCartney at Lennon's Dakota apartment in NYC did not actually occur. But according to former Beatles studio musician & manager George Martin's book, McCartney spontaneously buzzed Lennon's apartment at the Dakota lobby at some point in the '70s. Lennon reportedly did not allow him up to the apartment, & told Paul McCartney ""This isn't Liverpool  -- you can't come around like it's the old days."" Their long fued stemming from the Beatles' breakup in 1970 evidently left some lingering hard feelings, & it was common knowledge that McCartney & Yoko Ono could not stand one another. Their were many lawsuits between them that eventually destroyed Apple Records, & when I read that in Martin's book I was reminded of their song ""Sue Me, Sue You Blues"" & it's lasting mutual disaffection for the former megahit songwriting team.",1127952000,2,889,5.006756756756757
1807751,5,B00007ELFF,"Being the Beatlemaniac that I am, I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination. Having seen 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney - even with some make-up and proper hairdos - didn't help one bit.

But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised. It's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well, that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did. (The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know absolutely nothing; I feel confident that director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script.) Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles; it has very little plot, in fact, and takes place all in one day in New York City. What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. That meeting is entirely fictitious, of course - though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place. But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians - their intelligence, their sense of humor, their different reaction to stardom, and most of all their relationship; what made them such a great team, and what broke them up.

Since it's a talk movie, nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half, it's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles; but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching. For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life - so intimate and convincing is the script, and so committed are the actors. Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny. Most certainly recommended.",1127606400,6,2152,4.543814432989691
1807752,5,B00007ELFF,"Absolutely excellent! Having written about this episode in my book [pardon the plug!] YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION, I too have speculated about what might have happened. The scenario depected in this film is far better than the one I had in mind. For one thing, I didn't know that they went outside the Dakota -- in ""mufti,"" so to speak! And....of course....wouldn't it have been ""over the top"" had they actually taken Lorne Michaels up on the offer that ""Saturday Night""!",1125532800,3,473,4.710843373493976
1807753,5,B00007ELFF,"I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for good ""fan-fiction"" about my favorite bands and musicians, and that was the lure to me when I first heard about this movie. A ""what if"" story about a rumored meeting between the long-estranged band members, this film delivered more than I'd ever hoped for.

The lead actors may not bear the strongest physical resemblance to John and Paul, but they more than make up for it in the way they both seem to ""inhabit"" these ""characters"", and allow you to fall under the illusion they create for the film. And for a film that is primarily 90 minutes of two people talking (mostly in John's NY apartment, and then in Central Park and a tiny cafe), it is surprisingly engaging and swift-moving.  You don't need to be a Beatles expert to appreciate this film, although some basic knowledge of Paul and (particularly) John's personal histories do make the story that much richer.

The ending is bittersweet, but the only way the story really could have gone. As soon as I finished watching this movie the first time I knew I had to have it on DVD, as it's a story I'm going to want to revisit many times in the future, I'm sure. All in all, WAY more than I expected from a made-for-VH1 film.",1105056000,5,1212,4.45045045045045
1807754,5,B00007ELFF,"For anyone who loves the Beatles, (Half the population of Earth) you will be rewarded with a fictitious but very realistic account, of what may of happened on this infamous meeting. Paul's character played by Quinn was truly remarkable. Since his  death, so much of Johns place in history has been covered and magnified, while in many accounts Paul has been given an unfair shake on his place as an intelligent, sensitive and brilliant musician. I came off feeling how special and warm Paul is both in his humour and listening skills. Both actors though were outstanding. You walk away from this film wanting more. But unfortunatly we know, more did not happen. I would Love to see a movie of this kind be made of George Harrison's life. He is probably the most underrated musical genius of the modern era. Thank You!",1098230400,23,817,4.713286713286713
1807755,5,B00007ELFF,"Michael Linsey-Hogg, the director of Let It Be, weaves fact and fiction into a compelling movie about two of the greatest personalities of our generation.
McCartney comes off a bit too warm in this but its hard to see that as a flaw. Reputed to be a 'cool' person at the best of times perhaps we see through to the real Paul. Lennon on the other hand is accurately portrayed from the clowning to the acid wit he was so well known for.
While the actors don't physically resemble John and Paul that well they certainly come across as them if you just squint your eyes and pretend a little.
Best moments in the movie:
McCartney in a heartfelt moment telling John how during the break up of the Beatles he felt as though he was losing his best friend. Lennons acid response. ""We were never that close mate"".
A scene in Central Park with the two of them in disguise. Reminiscent of A Hard Days Night is the exchange between them and two mounted police. We laughed out loud at this one and the scene just felt right.
A scene in a restaurant when an elderly couple finally get there nerve up to approach John. They make the gaffe of requesting that he sing a few bars of Yesterday (Pauls song). Lennons response again had us laughing out loud and again it felt as though it really was John saying it.
The best moment of all is one with John and Paul on the roof of the Dakota. I won't attempt to describe this one but it brought tears to my eyes and confirmed to me that the chemistry between John and Paul was truly magic.
This movie brings back a little of the joy the Beatles brought to the world way back when. A celebration of John and Paul and the real world magic of Beatle music.",1079136000,34,1680,4.269592476489028

Look close to see the only person whoactually recognizes the 2 together and the knowing laughter old Beatlemania evokes in the greatest musical duo of all time.  There is also reference to a visit by Paul to John in LA where he was self destructing with Keith Moon, Harry Nillson et al.  The substory is Lennon's attempt to show off the freedom of NYC, where city folk aren't much impressed with celebrity.  That of course ultimately sealed his doom with an out of town fanatic at the doorway of his beloved Dakota.",1493078400,,686,4.644628099173554

7975450,3,B00007ELFF,"The personages of John Lennon and Paul McCartney are so etched in the minds of baby-boomers, and others, that we almost feel that we know them personally.  We know them from their music, movies, T.V. and radio appearances, and a million newspaper and magazine profiles and interviews.  Thus John is the acerbic and biting Mr. Witty Sarcasm and Paul is the mellow and agreeable Mr. Soft-Boiled Eyes.  This is a facile summing-up, but not without some truth, of two complex musical artists.  And ""Two of Us"" gives us exactly what we have come to expect.  It is a fictionalized drama with comedy about the real day in April 1976 when Paul, hard working and touring with Wings, dropped in unannounced on John, who was in the midst of a five-year loaf in New York's Dakota apartment building.  Yoko Ono and son Sean are away, ""shopping for a cow."" John is initially leery of his old partner, but after a cup of tea and some good weed, the awkwardness dissipates and they are exchanging jokes and banter like in the old days.  A swapping of information and recollections, familiar to Beatles fans, is spoken by the actors to establish their characters. John scorns Paul's #1 hit ""Silly Love Songs,"" and Paul questions John's ""painful"" songs and current torpor.  Eventually, they don Peter Sellers-type disguises and head out for a jaunt through Central Park, then drop in for some chocolate at one of John's favorite Italian restaurants.  There, a young man approaches Lennon with the expected trembling earnestness and bores him with ""You're a real hero to me.""  Mr. ""In-His-Own-Write"" fights the temptation to just brush the kid off, and actually engages him in a brief if tart conversation.  After this, the two ex-Beatles take a lift to the nearly medieval roof of the Dakota, where understanding Paul psychoanalyzes patient John as ""a scared kid who has become a scared man.""  John looks away and does not disagree.  As if!

Aidan Quinn does a tolerable Paul McCartney if you blur your eyes, but Jared Harris, who tries hard, does not look or sound much like John Lennon. Both actors mimic the familiar mannerisms and speech of their characters under the direction of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed the real Beatles' last movie, ""Let It Be"" (1970).  You will see how Lennon and McCartney almost accepted a offer to appear on ""Saturday Night Live"" for a $3,000 payment, which is a factual story.",1469664000,2,2397,4.82640586797066
