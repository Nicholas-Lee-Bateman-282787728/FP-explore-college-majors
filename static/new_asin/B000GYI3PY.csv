2621188,5,B000GYI3PY,"Joan Plowright gives one of her best performances in this deeply effecting little film.. I love all of the characters staying in the hotel..every detail is surprisingly well done.. This is no Harold and Maude tale as others have noted but rather a story of two people who seem to understand each other in a way that even their closest relations do not.. It is charming right to the end - even if somewhat predictable..

Joan Plowright has such a lovely presence and never has to force her acting at all - she is so natural and believable.. I am sure this movie will have a lasting power..",1169942400,88,588,4.444444444444445
2621189,5,B000GYI3PY,"I give this DVD 5 stars because I didn't want to stop watching. Plowright's acting is worth the view: she conveys complex emotions without saying a word or moving a muscle.  The rest of the cast holds up extremely well, and in fact many are stars in their own right.

Inevitably we'll be reminded of Harold and Maude but that's a mistake. Maude was a stronger character: she loved running around to funerals and she took charge of her life. No waiting around for nephew to call. No holing up in some dreary hotel.

I believe there are some misleading hints in the first half of the movie about what will happen in the second.

The movie would have been spicier and perhaps more entertaining if they had played out. But what we have is different and wholly deserving of praise in its own right.",1169337600,6,793,4.448275862068965
2621190,5,B000GYI3PY,"If you want to leave the worries of every day and consider the intimate moments of a life lived well, consider this lovely little gem.  Joan and her co-star will give you a delightful little getaway from the nasty and open a window into the sublime.  Relationships should be so lovely!",1168992000,14,285,4.568627450980392
2621191,5,B000GYI3PY,"MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT is an adaptation by Ruth Sacks of the book by British novelist Elizabeth Taylor (1912 - 1975) and directed with consummate skill by Dan Ireland. It is a showcase for the extraordinary talents of Dame Joan Plowright who owns the title role

Mrs. Palfrey (Plowright) is recently widowed and decides to move to a small hotel in London to spend her last years as a lady of independence. The Claremont is a crumbling old edifice that serves as a retirement home for a small but fascinating group of tenants: the fastidious but cranky Mrs. Arbuthnot (Anna Massey), a would-be suitor for Mrs. Palfrey's hand Mr. Osborne (Robert Lang), Mrs. Post (Marcia Warren), the nosy matchmaker Mrs. Burton (Georgina Hale), and a strange old couple, the De Salises (Millicent Martin and Michael Culkin). Once settled into her barely navigable room, Mrs. Palfrey meets her fellow 'inmates' at dinner, and announces that she has a grandson who will be calling on her at times. Yet despite multiple attempts her grandson Desmond (Lorcan O'Toole) doesn't respond and Mrs. Palfrey realizes she has entered a world of loneliness.

Out on an errand she falls and is befriended by a handsome young busker/writer Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend) who nurses her leg wound, makes her tea, and escorts her home. Ludo is a loner and lonely and when Mrs. Palfrey offers him dinner at the hotel he gladly accepts. But at the hotel the guests presume that Mrs. Palfrey's guest will be her grandson Desmond: Mrs. Palfrey hastily informs Ludo that she has erred and Ludo agrees to pose as her grandson. The guests at the hotel are charmed by Ludo, and Mrs. Palfrey and Ludo grow increasingly bonded - they share many likes and tastes and meld into a beautiful relationship that would be the envy of any grandmother and grandson. Mrs. Palfrey's loneliness is dissipated by Ludo and the effect is vice versa. How the two progress to the end of the film, finding new lives from old ones, forms the immensely touching finale to the film.

Though this film falls into the 'ensemble acting' category, so finely entwined are the performances of every actor in the cast, the film clearly belongs to Dame Joan Plowright whose performance once again proves that she is one of the durable treasures of cinema and stage. This is a film that will touch the hearts of even the most hardened viewers and this viewer cannot recommend it more highly. Grady Harp, December 06",1166918400,73,2446,4.805225653206651

The character studies were done well and although there could have been minor improvements, I thought it was an enjoyable 2 hours. I didn't want to say goodbye to them which is a testament to a good book or movie.

It also reminded me of what my 92 year old mother always says, about people her age being invisible, ignored by many and just ""one more thing"" for many in the family to deal with. We all need to have and be a ""Desmond"" to someone.",1500422400,,549,4.130841121495327

2621237,5,B000GYI3PY,"It's one of those movies that when it comes to an end you experience that one-hundredth of a second that happens when waking from a dream, and you realize you were a watcher instead of a partaker.  I would have done one more thing at the Claremont before I would have ended the movie and you'll agree after you see it.  You learn to love each character and wish that when you do wake up every day that they were still there; to invite over, to hear their voices and just to enjoy who they are.  By movies' end you wish that they were all ""your"" friends.",1499731200,,553,4.149532710280374

2621239,5,B000GYI3PY,"Ignore the ""be-raters,"" if you have even one romantic bone in your body, and watch this tender and moving movie.  The humor in it is subtle (very British) and sprinkled delicately throughout, making this fun, while still being a profound movie about the beauty and value of aging.  Joan Plowright acts the part of Mrs. Palfrey with amazing talent, and you can't help but fall in love with Rupert Friend (playing Ludovic Meyer).  He's a ""starving writer,"" as yet unpublished.  Their initial introduction and ensuing wonderfully deep and mutually beneficial friendship leave you feeling this is really no chance encounter; they both blossom and grow throughout the movie.  Without giving away the entire plot of the story, when Mrs. Palfrey passes on peacefully at the end, I was left grieving with Ludo the loss of a friend; the movie had that much pull on my emotions.  (Some said it was too long, and maybe so, but to really develop characters, it does take time.)  NOW, I just wish Amazon Prime would feature the original version of ""Brief Encounters"" mentioned in the movie (there's a remake out there, but it's not the one Mrs. Palfrey referred to)!",1499299200,,1153,4.8520408163265305
2621240,5,B000GYI3PY,"It has been a long time since a movie has enveloped me in its story and then brought me to tears.  This one did. On the surface, the story line is pretty simple and not terribly original. The true genius of the movie is bringing a character and her life alive to you so that you feel her life as if it were your own. With a lineup of some of the greatest character actors in British drama, every scene rings true and sincere with these quirky but very loveable characters.",1499212800,,472,4.186813186813187

2621255,5,B000GYI3PY,"I've seen Joan Plowright at work before and enjoyed her as a senior actress, she was really terrific here. This was Rupert Friend's first feature film and he handled it well. His balance against Joan was exquisite.  Her family members were poor seconds but 2 of the elders Anna Massey who is a multi BAFTA winner and Robert Lang a long standing stage and screen actor in the UK were great.  This movie was actually older than I realized but it seems timely- 2005.
Dig this Joan was married to Lawrence Olivier (1961-1989) WOOHOO!! AND She is Barroness Olivia, commonly known as Dame Joan Ploughright, DBE. Take a look at her early photos, she looks totally different!!",1498348800,,668,4.700854700854701

She is very lonely. She hopes to see her daughter in London and her grandson, but they do not visit. While walking in the city, she falls and is helped by a friendly young man.

I have to admit that I really have seen much of Rupert Friend's acting and now realize I need to catch up.  He is a wonderful actor.

I do wish that they did not have Mrs. Palfrey pass away in the end.  It seems so predictable to have the old person die.

So okay, the young ""Desmond"" is some nice eye candy, but there was much more depth to his character, which Mrs. Palfrey was keen enough to discover. It was a beautiful story, and makes one think about the twilight years and how to spend them.

This is where she is resigned to spend her remaining years as optimistically as possible. As we enter the dining room with her,  it appears as a setting in which individuals are quite solitary,  seated at their own tables, much like kids engaging in parallel play. But just as those children are still quite interested in what the other kids are doing, so are these seniors. The residents are a gregarious, curious, quirky bunch, who can't resist each other's company and stories. It's charming, amusing, and, yes, sentimental, in the best way. And that lovely mood begins when Mrs. Palfrey takes a fall on the street in front of the apartment of a kind, clever, gorgeous young man, Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend), a busker and aspiring writer. To say more would spoil. This is a smart, touching, glorious story, not to be missed.",1487808000,23,1080,4.821621621621621

2621493,4,B000GYI3PY,It is hard to give a movie a 5 star rating nowadays. I really enjoyed the movie. I understand how easy it is to become a Mrs. Palfrey. My husband could be the young man but not an author. He gets along better with people 20 or more years older than himself. It was nice to see their relationship as one of chosen family not just friends. It was sad to see her go but I was glad she her fake grandson for her last months. We all too often ignore and seem to forget our own family in the need to make a living. It was nice to see a young man enjoy life and make time for her. Not to ruin the movie but I wish my son watched this.,1486252800,2,627,3.757575757575758
2621494,5,B000GYI3PY,Not enough words to describe how good this movie was or how enjoyable it was to watch.

My neighbor came over and asked if I would watch it with her as her husband and grandkids had taken over the TV at her house.  That all  Grandmothers/people  would find accept, and respond to a friendship on that level, today, is probably only possible on the ""Silver Screen.""  Yet, the story was developed in a manner that I - we - found believable.  The ""true"" grandson AND HIS mother were also accurately portrayed. I might add, a little to realistically for my neighbor.

As humans, we need to give our elders time which in turn translates to love.  Because grandparents are in their elderly years, does not mean they are done living.  A nice dinner or outing now and then will give them a reason to dress up and LIVE.  Beautiful story! I love Mrs. Palfrey's  character and you will too.",1485820800,,598,4.6826923076923075

2621684,4,B000GYI3PY,"I always want to write more reviews, but I don't get around to it very often. The reason I'm writing this review for ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont"" is because I feel like this movie is one in which you could take a reasonable guess about whether you'd like it, if you know more about the tone, backstory, and pace of the story.

I really liked this movie, but this movie definitely isn't for everyone. I was watching it with my parents and my wife and I was the only one that was really enjoying it.

The tone is reflective, kind and old-fashioned.
I'm guessing that most people would define the pace as 'slow'. I would say 'leisurely'.
The backstory of how and why the movie was made was very interesting and inspiring to me. I definitely recommend looking into it.

If you want a story that pushes any sort of envelope, you might want to : take a pass
If you want a story that is action packed, you might want to : take a pass
If you like movies that inspire you to have more engaging relationships and interactions on a daily basis: watch this movie.",1485043200,4,1054,4.313131313131313

The scenery was wonderful . . London and evirons. I liked the characterizations of the different characters. There were some very sad scenes, but something that certainly occurs in life. This program dealt with life issues,such as loneliness, friendship, hope, ambition, and concern. The end of the feature did end on a positive and bittersweet note.

Well acted and draws the viewer in at the beginning and in the middle.  Various characters and their quirks are well done.  Amusing and touching story of Mrs Palfrey's nephew mix-up.  But then the story becomes very depressing with a real downer of an ending.  The earlier part of the film is almost misleading because the viewer is not expecting such an unexpected turn of events.

A chance meeting with a young writer broadens the widow's world again with a chance to reflect upon a life well lived.

The performances of Dame Plowright and Rupert Friend are enhanced by fine character portrayals by Anna Massey as the hotels dowager, and Timothy Bateson as the hotels doorman.

Director Dan Ireland has made a remarkable film dealing with relationship from the book by Elizabeth Taylor. Using natural settings and with fine acting this film becomes less one of sentimentality and more of heart touching kindness.",1480204800,,746,5.056910569105691

2622304,4,B000GYI3PY,"This is so far from today's action movies, that it was like finding a tiny gold nugget.  The story line is quite simple and predictable. A British lady of sufficient means moves to a London hotel so that she doesn't burden her daughter. At least that's what she says. The daughter is harsh and unloving, so I think Mrs. Palfrey moved to get away from her. Mrs. P. tells the other elderly hotel residents that she moved to London because her grandson worked there and she expected him to visit her.  He disappointed her. When she accidentally met a young man of his age, she asked him to pretend to be the grandson and have dinner with her in the hotel dining room.  I won't be a spoiler, but a tender, almost believable friendship develops between the lonely young man and Mrs. Palfrey.  The acting was excellent, but I think the young man was far too handsome for the part. I would have been more realistic if the young man was just ordinary-looking. Joan Plowright was marvelous in her role. This is a quiet, sad/sweet film that speaks to grandmothers like me who share Mrs. Palfrey's emotions.",1478131200,24,1096,4.548223350253807

If you have children and care, there is a 10-15 sec scene with a couple in bed. Other than that, it would be okay for kids and a good example for them. I have an elderly mother so it was probably more special to me. Older people really do appreciate all the kindnesses they receive as do all of us.

I'm a 66-year-old woman and think the movie would appeal most to older folks who know what loneliness is like, and what joy there is in making a new friend.

2622389,5,B000GYI3PY,"Laurence Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright (""Dance With Me"" and ""The Spiderwick Chronicles""), is Mrs. Palfrey. She is a Scottish widow who has moved to London to be on her own for the first time in her life. To her dismay, she discovers that the Claremont is nothing but an old folk's home where the elderly live quietly boring lives. She attempts to contact her only grandson, who is an archivist at the British Museum, but he doesn't return her calls.

One day, while returning from mailing a letter, she trips and falls. A young man (Rupert Friend! Write that down!) comes dashing out of his daylight apartment and helps her to her feet. He takes her inside, tends her injured knee, and makes her a cup of tea. To reciprocate, she invites him to the Claremont dining room for dinner the following Saturday.

When she announces at the Claremont she will be having a guest later on that week, the others immediately conclude that it is her mythical grandson, come at last! She fails to correct their error in time and realizes she has painted herself into a corner. She quickly warns the young man and he is sure he can play along and pretend to be her grandson. After all, he is a busker, an actor and a would-be writer, so feels he has both the talent and the wit to carry it off.

Their friendship grows and they both gain a great deal from their intergenerational exchange of ideas and points of view, movies and music, poetry and philosophy. Everything goes very, very well until her real grandson drops by to visit....and her domineering daughter gets involved.... and Mrs. Palfrey gets a proposal of marriage...and...

By the way, this is heartwarming in a sweetly poignant way...

It was a shock when I realized I didn't have this one reviewed here on Amazon. I have been recommending it for years! But, I must warn you...the DVD does NOT have closed captions, which was a big disappointment to me, as I rely on them far more than most of you. On the other hand, I must express my heartfelt gratitude that evidently British writers are forced to type with their shirts off!

2622396,5,B000GYI3PY,"Just a brilliant, precious, poignant film.  There are few movies that I add to my list of movies worth watching over and over again, but I am so happy to be able to add Mrs. Palfrey to my list.  I only wish there had been a series of films with this character.  I'm a GenXer who had rare opportunities to be with my grandparents, and how I would have loved to have had a Mrs. Palfrey in my life.  I would still love to have one, but I think the opportunity has passed me by.  The generation that follows Mrs. Palfrey's is too afraid to acknowledge the passing of time and believe that 70 is the new 30.  When they all turn 80, then 80 will be the new 30 I guess.  The pursuit of youth will never end.  And, for those who are actually still young, and who could use some Mrs. Palfreys in their lives - meaning wise old folks with more to offer than advice on how to deny the passing of time - it is a shame.  I had already long ago decided that I would strive to be one of those white-haired little old grannies some day, and that is still my goal.  Now, my goal has been tweaked a bit.  If I can accomplish becoming one of those white-haired grannies with even the tiniest bit of grace and some accompanying wisdom like the fictional Mrs. Palfrey, then I will be satisfied.  This film is one for the ""great films"" library.  I wish there were more precious gems like it. I highly recommend.",1477008000,,1389,4.138059701492537

2622616,5,B000GYI3PY,"This was a great movie and I loved every second. The acting was superb and the story very touching. I would wholeheartedly recommend.

March 2, 2017 - Just watched for the second time and, if possible, it was even more meaningful. I truly wish there were more movies like this gem out there.

Just a bit about the story-line itself. An elderly woman, Mrs Palfrey, moves into a long term hotel who caters to the elderly. Living there on a month to month basis she contacts her only grandson quite a few times and not only does he never show up to visit, he doesn't return the calls either. One day when 'Sa Sa' (the name her grandson had given her when he was a young boy) fell after leaving the library she landed right in from of a young man's apartment. He runs out to help her and a wonderful relationship is born. She considers him her adopted grandson and he is the only person in the world who truly and deeply cares about her. When her real grandson finally appears she asks him to leave, not wanting the other residents to know she has been lying about the young man who faithfully comes to see her known to them all as her grandson. It was beautiful, heartwarming, inspiring, lovely, touching, loving.....fantastic!!

Joan Plowright makes you feel for Mrs. Palfrey as you watch her make the best of the world she finds after what is essentially an error of incomplete research.  Her new friendships and the chance meeting of a caring young man enrich every life.  I am very glad I watched this video.

2623024,5,B000GYI3PY,"This movie may very well be one of the top ten movies of our century.

It has heart. Emotion. Character (and, frames CHARACTERS in fun clash of love and interaction with one another).

I feel i have glimpsed something wonderful... but when I go to pick it apart, it is as if Mrs. Palfrey's memories are my memories. And they dance like fireflies.. so enjoyable, so alive... so quotable... so full of lessons that is hard to define one exact moment from the movie to relate here in this review.

Just trust me that this movie is far more than a one time watcher.  It is chock full of wonderful acting, good writing, and deep story.

I was able to watch it free on Prime... but i think it is one i will need to add to my permanent collection

I should note that I know very little of Mrs. Palfrey's world, and relate much more readily with her ""grandson"".  I am not British.  I have not lived a long life.  But, in the end, find I share more with these characters than I knew.  That is to say, this movie is for all ages. As long as you have no need for filthy violence, or special effects that so often drive a trivial story. As long as you don't mind a thought provoking WONDERFUL film. Watch it!!  It's a grade A movie filmed with a grade B camera...  But, i implore you - whoever you are- give Mrs Palfrey a CHANCE!  you will love it!

Joan Plowright is very good, but she can handle roles like this in her sleep (her character is a bit like an amiable version of the one in Enchanted April), and the supporting cast mainly play, very engagingly to be sure, characters that are 80% stereotype.  Rupert Friend does a fine job, I think, in what may be the most difficult role, making a thoroughly nice guy interesting. Zo Tapper, who resembles Scarlett Johansson but not to a cringe-inducing extent, is appealing in an undemanding role. If you like movies of the Marigold Hotel-Enchanted April sort you'll probably like this, though it's a smaller movie and certainly not nearly as good as Enchanted April..",1467158400,,813,4.711267605633803

Widows or widowers, who could rely on their husbands', or their own pensions, used to check themselves into one of several hotels in the Bayswater, Lancaster Gate area where they were provided room and board for a pre-negotiated monthly rate. The English are not naturally gregarious and this leads to isolation and loneliness in this setting.

2623316,5,B000GYI3PY,"Such a sweet movie.""Destiny puts us on the path and then it's up to us"", Mrs Palfrey says (or something to that effect), and it must have been destiny that led me to watch this heart tug of a film. Rupert Friend is excellent in his attentively bittersweet role as the adopted grandson who rescues the elderly and plucky Plowright from the monotony of life among the declines of the Claremont crowd, and renews the love of her life. The family dynamic of irritated neglect portrayed in this movie is one that many seniors face, but the passing of gentile sensibilities that our elders can pass on to the youth of today so well inhabited by the friendship of Sasa and Luda is sadly rare in today's harried and self-obsessed world. If you yearn for a film with no gratuitous sex, blood and guts violence, explosive car chases, and glorification of greed, pour a glass of claret, curl up with the afghan your grandma made for you, and settle in for lovely journey.

My husband and I are in our late 80's  so we held hands while we watched it on the monitor. Fortunately, we have a large loving family nearby, but we can  relate to this movie because everyone is so busy with work, children, and other activities. We know that our ""children"" would come in a minute if we need help, but it is easy for us to feel that the world is too busy now and we don't want to be a problem if possible. We receive numerous invitations to do things with the family, but more and more it is not possible to make the drive to these things and return home  in heavy Interstate traffic. For us this is the kind of movie's we enjoy. They don't come to our Movie theater very often. Cathy Fleming",1461801600,,826,4.111801242236025

2623560,5,B000GYI3PY,"To those of you who felt the need to tell us all how boring this movie is and went so far as to give it one or two stars, I must say that I feel sorry for you.
This is a very poignant story about a young man, an aspiring writer, who chances to meet an elderly woman who has been abandoned by her family.  The story line progresses to show their relationship deepening as surrogate grandson and grandmother with much respect between the two.  No, there are no cars blowing up, blood or guts, or curse words, so maybe that is why it isn't appealing to some. But for those of us who have an appreciation for respectful relationships, it is simply a joy!
It isn't supposed to be 'fast paced'.  It's a story.  It's a delightful reminder that there really isn't much difference between the older generation and the younger, it is simply a circle of life that, at it's core, remains constant no matter how many years, decades, or centuries may pass.  We are born, we live, we love, we marry, we grow old, and then the next generation repeats our cycle to infinity.  In a short two hours, we get to see what that looks like and grow an appreciation for how, when the two extremes meet, it can be as beautiful and fulfilling as any relationship that we may ever have. It gives us purpose.  It feeds our soul.
It is beautifully written, expertly acted, and meant to be enjoyed by those of all ages, so just enjoy it.
We all can learn from each other, but it starts with recognizing that the other is there.  We have to be willing to take the chance.  This is a good lesson on how to do that and everyone winding up a winner because of it.",1456876800,,1628,4.242718446601942

2623824,5,B000GYI3PY,A sweet movie with a captivating cast.,1447891200,,38,4.571428571428571
2623825,3,B000GYI3PY,"First, Joan Plowright is an excellent actress. If I was to rate this movie on her acting alone, I would give it 5 stars. (I also found it interesting that a Mrs. Arbouthnot (not sure how to spell that) was in this film. See Joan Plowright in ""Enchanted April."" There was a Mrs. Arbouthnot in that too. Strange coincidence, or a subtle, private connection?) Nonetheless, there were many aspects of this film that I found problematic - unrelated to her acting.

It really is too bad that they do not write better scripts for a woman of her age. It seems that all of the films out there tend to go to younger stars, and it seems a shame to waste the talent of older actors who could really teach the younger generation a thing or too (and yes, I am still young, so I think I can speak fairly). As you may have guessed by now, one of the biggest problems with this film was the script.

It is not thoroughly dreadful, but it could have some terribly awkward moments, and by the end of the film, the minutes were dragging and I was practically begging it to end. Yet the overall concept was interesting - a young, struggling writer, without many friends, although rather ""handsome"" and extraordinarily polite, develops an unusual relationship with a lonely, yet poetic woman old enough to be his grandmother. There is nothing overtly romantic to their relationship, but some of the covert moments get REALLY REALLY AWKWARD.

From the start, there was something not right about his almost overly eager interest in her. Perhaps I am just jaded, but I almost kept wondering if his taking her into his home, offering her tea, and tending to her wounds almost the way a young man in a paperback romance might, hid some devious intent. Was he planning to spike her tea, run off with her money? Most young men would not go to such great lengths (in terms of being so overly eager and almost romantic), and it felt more as if he was treating her like he would a potential young love interest. I mean, the loooong, drawn out, almost sensual, tender blow of air upon her knee?? Really?? I just felt creeped out. He was going overboard, as if he had just met Marilyn Monroe, not a woman he should respect in a more distant way, as an elder. I even wondered if maybe he was some guy with a weird thing for older ladies.

Yet there were some genuinely realistic moments as well. It certainly is not impossible for two such people to form an unlikely friendship. It is just that they usually do not sit in the firelight, alone together at night, sharing a candlelight dinner and then one serenading the other with a look of longing in his eyes. They just seemed to keep crossing subtle lines that were making me so uncomfortable. I was almost afraid they might start kissing! He would have never acted that way if he had been with a guy his age - you could have easily swapped Joan Plowright for a young lady and it would have come across as thoroughly romantic.

But the premise was good, and I think that if you read some of the other reviewers, and think that it might be for you, then you might still enjoy it. All in all, I would have to stress again that it really is too bad that better scripts do not go to actors and actresses of Joan Plowright's age range. She really is a delight to watch. This film could have been much better if the script had been tighter and better developed, without those creepy overtones.

I hope that Hollywood wakes up and begins to realize that even younger people can enjoy a film with older actors. They have a lot to offer.",1447891200,9,3545,4.412844036697248

Thank you, Amazon, for making it available. Joan Plowright is ever so adorable in the title role: an independent elder lady that has a heart that has kept all the freshness of the years when life was just opportunities in front of her eyes to be grabbed. A brave, intrepid woman that is years ahead of the generations that come after her: her daughter and grandson have nothing to do with her.
Rupert Friend! Ah, Rupert Friend: that was the first time I saw him in any movie and he seemed to be amazing at first sight. His performance as a rogue killer in ""Homeland"" proofs me right!",1445472000,3,630,4.3474576271186445

2623966,3,B000GYI3PY,"Joan Plowright is a ringer for my mother, aunt and grandmother. Every time I see her it gives me a start. She's one of my favorites for bringing depth and humanity into every story, even dumb stories like this one.  I liked this film because she was in it.

I listen while I work, so I've seen three films this afternoon. All three were about getting old, being lonely or facing illness and dying. In other words, about old age = being pathetic and deserted. Stereotypes, no matter how well acted, are boring. Surely it can't have been written by anyone who knows what he/she is talking about!",1444694400,,593,4.481481481481482

2623992,4,B000GYI3PY,Darling movie.  Sometimes the people you can count on are not necessarily family.

2623998,4,B000GYI3PY,"An unlikely but uplifting friendship develops between a young person and an older person reminding us that we can add value to each other's lives if we forget the age barrier and see the person.
Joan Plowright is wonderful. The entire cast is great. We come to see the older folks as individuals not just generic old cranks. Rupert Friend as the ""grandson"" strikes just the right note - a little bit good, a little bit bad - so that the movie didn't head into the sugary sweet territory. The polar opposite of his role on Homeland, it's interesting to see his range of acting styles - and he's quite good looking.

This is the kind of movie you can watch more than once and will recommend to friends. No guns and gore or cruelty. Yes, some sad moments but overall a feeling of warmth and a good blend of old and young persons problems and promise",1443139200,,846,4.388535031847134

2624005,5,B000GYI3PY,"Joan Plowright plays the elderly widow who's taken up residence in a seniors boarding house.  Rupert Friend plays her devastatingly good-looking young friend, who starts out pretending to be her grandson and ends up doing a better job of it than her real grandson.

Joan Plowright does a wonderful job of saying a lot without saying much. Rupert Friend is charming and disarming. And I love the whole cast of quriky characters who also call the Claremont Hotel home.

This is a gentle movie about kindness, but it's never sappy or manipulative.  I've watched it three times already.",1443139200,,582,4.908163265306122

2624012,5,B000GYI3PY,What a gem!  I love the relationship between the two main characters.

2624039,4,B000GYI3PY,"The only reason I gave Mrs. Palfrey... 4 instead of 5 stars, is because I know this movie won't appeal to everyone. It won't appeal to those who are not interested in a story with a singular plot line, or that isn't action-packed. If you're looking, however, for a movie with main characters who will draw you in, if you want to experience the fascinating complexity of people who seem otherwise ordinary, then you, like me, may love this movie. The acting is wonderful. The story addresses a widow who finds herself in a situation, living at the Claremont Hotel, that turns out to be much different than what she anticipated; and, a young man who accidentally lands in her life. Often humorous as well as bittersweet, we are invited to believe that it is possible to find ""new"" family at any age.",1442361600,3,797,4.580419580419581

The casting was perfect -  Joan Plowright was a wonderful Mrs. Palfrey and it was awesome watching the friendship develop between her and the young artist/musician played superbly by Rupert Friend.  He was sooo handsome and was such a joy to watch as he showed so much kindness to Mrs. Palfrey and became her substitute grandson (her real grandson didn't have time for her).  I just loved him in this.  I've seen him in Pride & Prejudice, but he really did shine in this one.  I loved Joan Plowright too - she looked so classy & proper and lovable.",1442188800,,697,4.3984375

2624190,2,B000GYI3PY,"I'm baffled at the overall 4 star rating. I'm a Joan Plowright fan, so with the high ratings I felt sure this would be a good film. Instead, it was slim on plot and overflowing with earnest overacting. I ended up fast forwarding 15 minutes, watching 2 minutes, and repeating through the end -- and honestly don't feel that I missed a single plot twist or interesting piece of dialogue. Possibly my 82 yr old mom and her friends might like watching this Hallmark-channel wannabee, but I was quite disappointed.",1440806400,,509,4.666666666666667

2624194,5,B000GYI3PY,"Ms Plowright was cantankerous in Enchanted April and is gentle in this film. Sad reflection on too many families that are too busy to be bothered with the older members. Yet encouraging to think of those chance encounters that become friends regardless of age. Not a ""heavy"" or ""deep"" film, not a lengthy development of characters which makes it even more wonderful because you get to use your imagination and visualize a few too many actual people in  your own life in the characters.",1440720000,,485,4.773809523809524

2624196,5,B000GYI3PY,"You have to have patience to allow the characters to develop, but the pay-off in the end was worth it to me. The part I liked best about it was that it portrayed a loving relationship that was simple and innocent between a young man with parent issues and an older woman with child and grandchild issues. Everything doesn't have to be about sex! And it's refreshing to see real love portrayed that doesn't involve lust. This film moves slowly, so if you like action/adventure this won't do it for you. Don't bother - you'll fall asleep.",1440633600,,536,4.536082474226804

This is a quiet, sweet film that gives a view of a rarely seen relationship that does happen in real life...occasionally. 4-Stars because it is a sweet story that is worth seeing, but not a fantastic movie.

2624308,5,B000GYI3PY,"One of my best friends bought a DVD of this film as a gift to me and I could not believe that I had not watched this gem of a film before this. Dame Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Palfrey, a 70-something widow who takes up residence at the dowdy Claremont hotel in London, which is inhabited by many other elderly people. Everyone sort of keeps to themselves, and it is obvious that Mrs. Palfrey is not quite among like-minded people. She waits in vain week after week, hoping that her only grandson who happens to work in London, will stop by and visit. Weeks pass and one day, as she is out and about, she falls. A young man comes to her rescue and takes her up to his small apartment, where over a cup of tea and some sympathetic words, the two forge a bond that gets closer over a period of time.

The young man is Ludovic Meyer or Ludo (Rupert Friend) who is an aspiring writer. Ludo doesn't have much confidence in himself, partly because his own mother finds him a disappointment, but Mrs. Palfrey encourages him. Ludo also helps Mrs. Palfrey out by acting as her grandson to dispel the general belief among the hotel's residents that this grandson is non-existent. I loved the banter between the two: the older, genteel widow who shares her life experiences and imparts bits of wisdom, and the young man seeking to make a future for himself and gaining confidence, while also imparting one of life's greatest gifts - the gift of friendship and loyalty.

By the movie's end, I was in tears. There is such a bittersweet feel to this film, and I could not help  wishing that I too someday, in my twilight years will be blessed with a special friendship like that shared between Mrs. Palfrey and Ludo. Highly recommended.",1438387200,9,1720,4.4888178913738015

2624313,5,B000GYI3PY,"This is a story of a lady who goes to a ""retirement hotel"" to spend her last years.  There is a little something for every one.  And then there is the Desmond imitator.  This is a love story between generations. Mrs. Palfrey is the generation before the Boomers and Desomond is an era unto himself.  Every grandmother would want to have a grandson of the same caliber as Desmond Imitatior.  It is touching and leaves a lasting impression.",1438214400,,438,4.564102564102564
2624314,5,B000GYI3PY,"I thought it was a fun interesting show.  One being her grandson and how he was and the other being someone who truly was a friend.  How the young and old can mix  and learn from each other.  How they all three handled situations when they happened.  Some may find this uninteresting, but watch it and see.  I thought it had a good story line covering all of the characters that were in it.",1438214400,,390,4.202702702702703

She was in ""Enchanted April"" which I had to own. It's also a wonderful film that I love to rewatch and also read the book. I also love Rupert Friend. It's a good two hanky film. I wish there were more of them out there. If you enjoy a lovely, sweet, heart filled film that isn't at all cheesy but has adorable, sweet people in it, this is the movie for you. It's just one of those films you can cuddle up under a blanket with a glass of wine on a rainy day and just enjoy to the fullest.",1438214400,,641,4.015625

Family is not about genetic ties, its about people who love and values you. Just because you a related to someone by blood do not mean they are family, or will love you in the end. In the end your real family can come from unexpected places. Mrs Palfrey found this in her last developmental stage, moving into the Claremont, a casual meeting with a young writer opens her life to a wonderful world of meaningful friendship that sees her through the rest of her life.

2624383,5,B000GYI3PY,"A heart-warming film about nice people doing their best while suffering from an incurable disease: age. Yes, as some reviewers have said, the young musician/writer is too good, too good-looking, too charming to be real. But after all these people are not real, this is a movie. Most movies are made up of equally unreal but really nasty people, these unreal people are really nice. For those of us at or near their age, moreover, we note that these people, while obviously not rich, have enough to afford a decent retirement home with table service in the dining room and a pleasant, supportive staff. Most retirees in the UK, and even more in the US, can anticipate a much bleaker last chapter to their lives. A very nice film which fully justifies suspension of disbelief where necessary.",1436572800,14,790,4.773722627737226

It certainly gives a very accurate account as to what it is like to live in a body that has grown.  The love between Sasa and her late husband radiates from her.

Brief encounter of aging grandmother and strange young writer made their lives changed dramatically. It is possible and believable. Heartwarming, delightful and somehow emotional great movie. It shows sometimes real friend could be better than family relationship. Mrs. Palfrey was played well together with young writer-to-be friend.

Even though improbable, it all seemed so natural and London never looked better.  ""Brief Encounter"" also is improbable but that doesn't take away the charm.

Without Joan P. and some of the words written for her, the movie would be just a downer but instead it is a mixture of charm, wit, sadness, and love.  Can't really decide if I love this movie or hate it for making me wonder about my own life.",1434931200,,543,4.444444444444445

2624483,5,B000GYI3PY,"There are far too few good human interest stories like this well done Mrs Palfrey. The acting is excellent by all. Joan Plowright is outstanding in this
role, as she is in every other role she has undertaken in the past. This is what life is all about; one day immature minds will wake up to realize that
they are about to play such a role themselves. I mean the Mrs, and Mr Palfrey type role: time flies away far too quickly. Ludo was an ideal role
for Rupert Friend; almost every widow and widower, would benefit by such a loving and sincere friendship. It is unfortunate that two of the other
very good performers, Robert Lang and Anna Massey, have passed on before they were able to give us more outstanding performances. I have
observed first hand, the dining habits of mostly widows, in the wonderful Arizona Inn, in Tucson, in the 80s and 90s; they sat alone, seemingly
enjoying their delicious meals, and their phantom partners across the table. The Claremont type of old fashioned environment is not for everyone
but there are probably such establishments that still exist throughout the world for those mature people who wish to live independently, amongst
like minded people. Hopefully there are a few Mrs Palfrey type personalities to stir up the pot of boredom. I highly recommend this movie.",1433808000,,1305,4.728070175438597

Mrs. Palfrey is a realistic woman who meets a needy and charming young man who is kind and fascinated by her life.  They get to know each other in that truly very special way that some of us have been lucky enough to have with a grandmother.  There is a connection of souls that are generations apart, but sometimes as near as a heartbeat.  Their story is delightful, charming, based in reality but played out in their need for each other.

All I can say is he is one handsome guy and made the whole film worth watching. Although I cannot see this happening to this extent in real life it was a fun escape.,1433721600,,447,4.149425287356322

But it turned out to be the MOST beautiful movie EVER and is now NUMBER ONE on my top 10 list. Given that True Grit has been at number one and never been pushed of that spot since I first saw it when I was just a girl, that is really saying something.

I have no words for this movie. It is not what it appears to be at first... it is however deep, divine and moving beyond words. There is no category for it and I hate romances. However, it is altogether romantic but in a different way than you could ever imagine.

I thought Pay it Forward was one of the most inspiring movies ever... but no, this one has inspired me more. Perhaps it is just me, but Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is the most inspiring and moving movie I've ever seen.

Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont.

I loved it so much on Hulu, I'm buying it immediately now from Amazon. This is a keeper to watch time and again and probably learn every line. This is true art... story telling at its best.

Mrs. Palfrey proves it.  She brings the viewer into the lady's life and experiences with a gentleness that also shows a take-charge attitude at times. The relationship between her and the young man who happens into her life one day blossoms into a truly touching part of the movie.
The story provides humor and a touch of sadness, too.  What a surprise and blessing to watch a movie about the older generation forming a wonderful, warm relationship with a kind and caring young man.  There is the usual obligatory bed scene (totally unnecessary, in my opinion) with
the young man and his girlfriend, but otherwise this was a delightful one-of-a-kind movie.",1431993600,,804,4.925925925925926

I don't recommend this for cold and insensitive people, unless perhaps in the hope that it might change them for the better. Needless to say, this is a touching film and a real tear jerker (especially at the end). I think the acting is superb: Joan Plowright did a great job as the leading lady, even though she is more well-known as a supporting actress. Rupert Friend was also very warm and charming, and I must confess that I enjoyed him much more as a caring adopted ""grandson"" in this piece rather than the Nazi he played in ""The Boy with the Striped Pyjamas. The plot is nothing new: it's the typical story of two people who unexpectedly become friends, but it is also a touching portrayal of loneliness, friendship, growing old, living and dying.",1425081600,,852,4.6490066225165565

Certainly an odd couple, the elderly Mrs. Palfrey is treated so well and respectably by the young Ludovic ""Ludo"" Meyer. I was enchanted by the sweet friendship between these two. She, seemingly forgotten by her own family and the young writer who behaves as though he is from another time. We never do really find out his background, or learn more about her family's but we do not need to. The exchange between these two characters is enough to carry the entire film.",1421280000,,566,4.6138613861386135

2624587,2,B000GYI3PY,"Elizabeth Taylor's (not that Elizabeth Taylor) novel, which is good but deeply depressing, is set during the early '60's. The huge problem with the film, is that it doesn't seem to know exactly when it's taking place. So when Ludo, the character played by Rupert Friend mentions Terence Rattigan, a great British playwrite who was at his peak during the 40's, and is little know today; and who is also familiar with a song that was written in 1933, all credibility goes out the window. If they'd set it when it was written you'd possibly buy it, but unless you're a hopeless romantic, the lack of authenticity makes it very difficult to swallow. And why are the frantic streets of London so empty? On the plus side, Rupert is pretty in a weak sort of way, and Joan's relentless gurgling is under control. So we can be thankful for that.",1411344000,,836,4.58

2624592,4,B000GYI3PY,"This is a unique film.  It was very well done, the acting very good, and a very poignant film.  It was a story of a wonderful relationship between a young man and an older woman (grandson type relationship).  It is a relationship that anyone in their last years would love to have; a thoughtful young man who can see through the wrinkles and appreciate another human being for who they are - period!  No motives.  Unfortunately, it is also sad.  The movie has the ability to draw in the viewer to the reality of old age.  Another words, we can very much empathize with the characters in this movie.  Overall, it sends home a clear message and is very well done.",1408924800,,661,4.404958677685951

2624601,1,B000GYI3PY,"I am a true fan of Ms. Plowright's work, but I want my time back on this one. It starts with a mediocre and barely believable script about a proud, gentle lady in her third act who has just lost her husband and has been inexplicably abandoned by the entire rest of her family and friends. Apparently without much research into it, she moves into an ""hotel"" full of miserable people who, by the admission of one of them ""have come here to die"". And die some of them do. If you love Ms. P the way I do, please rather watch ""Enchanted April"" or ""Tea with Mussolini"" and skip this one.",1405641600,,581,4.196428571428571

2624604,4,B000GYI3PY,"Great little film...and a great escape yet not too unrealistic in the sense that one day we may all face feeling a lonely displacement in old age when the people we once knew has moved or passed on and younger relatives seem to not have time for us anymore. Joan Plowright is spot on as a dignified senior who now lives at a retirement place of sorts. Each person has their own little room or compartment and while relationships between residents are brisk and shallow and definitely unexplored, Mrs. Palfrey is just around the corner from meeting a new friend from outside who begins to fill that gap. The actor who portrays her friend is devastatingly handsome btw!
I enjoyed this movie quite a bit... though was left with what I usually feel of slightly quirky films; that I wish there were more 'enchanted aprils, Mrs. Palfreys, tea with mussolini and ladies in lavender' type people around to come together and to truly care about each other! It just seems so simple to do and yet the reality is, life isn't this charming! Which is why I guess these kind of movies engage the part of us who wishes life could be this way - more simple and straightforward.
Another noticeable thing (and not to be a damper) in films like this is ...most of them depict characters who've some degree of financial security or even wealth. Unfortunately, especially in the US - many elderly do NOT possess enough income to live in these settings and must rely on family members, live in situations where they are isolated and without help and tend to live a much lesser quality of life. I wonder if in the U.K. the quality of life for seniors on limited incomes is better than here in the states???",1403136000,,1682,4.554455445544554
2624605,5,B000GYI3PY,I had never heard of this movie. It's wonderful. Teaches us all about caring and kindness. Joan Plowright is fabulous and knows just how far to carry her role into the viewer believing she's Mrs. Palfrey. This movie is lovely and worth watching.,1400976000,,245,4.72093023255814

2624610,5,B000GYI3PY,"This is a delightful movie, rather slow-paced, but in a good way. You can savor every moment. It's a sweet platonic romance between a twenty-something man and an elderly woman who just moved into a not-quite-seedy retirement home. It reminds me of Harold and Maude, but it's not as offbeat. I won't spoil the ending, but I'll offer that I've watched it 3 times now. A very nice way to spend a couple of hours.",1398384000,,409,4.466666666666667

One day she falls and a young man, Rupert Friend, befriends her.  He is lonely, too, and they cultivate a friendship.  This movie shows the joys of friendship.  He needs some mothering, or grandmothering, and Mrs. Palfrey enjoys the companionship of a young man who reminds her of her grandson.  Her grandson is too busy for her.  This film is primarily a study of their friendship, and is a sweetly sentimental story.  I liked it as I enjoy Plowright and London.  It's not a complex plot and not particularly buoyant or upbeat.

Mrs. Palfrey's first disappointment was the Claremont; it was a far cry from what was advertised in the brochure.  But, being the pleasant and stalwart individual that she is, she swallowed her disappointment and made the best of it.  The next disappointment was her grandson - a self-centered, immature lad who did not see beyond his own wants.  And then came the bright spot when she made the acquaintance of a young man  who is, in essence, what she wished for in her grandson.  We should all aspire to have the attitude of Mrs. Palfrey in our lives.

Love for the reasons all the Gods of all the original religions circumscribed it.

2624666,4,B000GYI3PY,"This is the story of an older woman, a widow, played magnificently by Joan Plowright, who moves into a residential hotel for retired people in London.  She has hoped to establish contact with her grandson who lives in London but he never returns her calls and she finds herself increasingly lonely.  One day she slips and falls in the street and a young man rushes out of his basement flat and helps her.  He is as lonely in his own way as she is, and the two form a strange but lovely friendship.  The young man is perfectly played by the very romantic looking Rupert Friend.

The story is simple and well told. I found the scene where the fellow sings ""For All We Know"" to the woman quite beautiful.  Plowright's tears will bring tears to the viewer, I guarantee.  Personally I got a little tired of Plowright's character's  saintliness and I found the ending quite syrupy/sentimental.

Who can predict what people will have that magic something which translates into deep friendship. In these days, we see alot about love, true love, romantic love, and let's not forget the ""the opposite of love""... this movie is different in that it portrays friendship love... a deep, precious and comfortable love that transcends age. When I was a young mom, I had a close and dear friend named Esther who was in her late 60's. We were truly BFF's... this movie reminded me of that relationship.

2624670,5,B000GYI3PY,"Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is one of those films I can curl up with on those days when a bit of comfort is needed. It's about getting older, seeing one's mortality, and yet always reaching out generously to others. Joan Plowright must be in her 80's now, and not a typical ""romantic"" lead actress, but this part allows her to use her considerable talents, and to great effect. Ignored by her family and missing her late husband, ""Mrs. P."" moves to a seedy residence hotel in London, where she interacts with the usual suspects, who are aging and each very strange in their own ways. It's very amusing and poignant, but there wouldn't be much of a film to report about without her chance meeting with a poor busker who comes to her aid after a fall in the street. The way in which the friendship which follows is developed by the actors, the writer, and the director, is what makes this gem what it is. In other hands, this plot could have gone over the top in many ways, but with perfect British restraint, the story of Sarah Palfrey and her young rescuer unfolds in a sweetly natural way. Rupert Friend is 100 %, in looks, acting ability, and he even sings. Joan Plowright shows that she still has it, in every way. The rest of the cast is excellent. Bring your hankies, but prepare to smile through your tears. This is a love story you don't want to miss.",1334102400,3,1360,4.400793650793651

In this gem of a movie the main character (played beautifully by Rupert Friend) develops a friendship with an older woman who teaches him a bit about life and not giving up on your dreams. Their relationship reminds us that the spirit of a person is not diminished by age, that wisdom is a treasure to be valued as much as friendship itself, and that our words and actions are not insignificant even if we aren't aware of their effect on someone else. There is so much we don't know and can't see beyond ourselves and our own life experiences, and we all have so much potential- more than I would guess most of us even realize. What if one small move on your part gave someone else the encouragement and inspiration they needed, and made a life-changing difference for them? What if someone did this for you?

2624683,5,B000GYI3PY,"'You never call, you never write.'  That lament is probably uttered hundreds of times a day around the world.  And that's exactly the situation Mrs. Palfrey finds herself in when she moves into a hotel-cum-retirement home, the Claremont.  It's a severe change of pace for Palfrey, but she gamely makes the most of it.  Meanwhile, she's told the residents that her grandson has promised to visit, but he never does.  Some suspect that this mysterious grandson is just a figment of the older lady's imagination.

A chance encounter with a struggling writer leads to a visit to the Claremont, where he can get a nice meal and a nice chat.  Assumptions are made that this is Mrs. Palfrey's long-rumored grandson, a rumor Palfrey does nothing to dispel.

Joan Plowright adds another great performance to a long and distinguished career in the titular role.  At times a bit daft, but mostly just sweet and a bit lonesome, Plowright fits the role to a T.  The audience has no trouble in believing her to be exactly whom she is playing.

Rupert Friend plays Ludovic Meyer, a down-on-his-luck aspiring writer, and beautifully fits in as the long-absent grandson.  He's a bit puzzled at first, but true affection blooms between the two, and he makes a better and more dutiful relative than the real grandson obviously is.

This is a sweet, poignant movie that is definitely worth watching, mainly for the performances of Plowright and Friend, but also for the bittersweet tale of love and loss, of the worth of the older person, who may have a hard time getting around, but has had a rich life and much to teach their younger compatriots.

Strongly recommended.  Appropriate for most ages, but probably best targeted to those neglectful children (and grandchildren) who just can't seem to make any time for those who sacrificed so much to raise them.",1289606400,,1840,4.833865814696486

A woman  recently widowed moves into a London hotel with a distinguished name --the Claremont--but not much else.
She is placed in a tiny room and eats from the marginal menu with each occupant at a separate table, watching each other. And yet, each of them would seem to want nothing more than a friend, some companionship.
As described in the Beatles ""Eleanor Rigby"" ---""All those lonely people, where do they all come from?""

The widow, played by the ever-lovely Joan Plowright, finds unexpected friendship with a young writer played by Rupert Friend. While the snoops in the hotel dining room are persuaded that this is the grandson who has been ignoring her, his charm wins not only Plowright, but all those lonely people.

For seniors reading this review, let's hope we do not spend the final  period of our life alone. Keep reaching out, not only to family but to friends and potential friends.
Even the residents of the Clarmont Hotel somehow manage to be a comfort now and then.

She has been favorably compared to Jane Austin writing 11 novels before she passed on in 1975.

The natural process of aging was taken head on, which is more than I can say about any other aspect of the entertainment/marketing industry.

This sort of charitable, unselfish behavior is encouraged constantly at my church and I've actually seen many examples of young (and middle-aged) people befriending and being kind to elderly people, and I don't mean just a yearly trip to visit a nursing home (although that's a good start).

This movie is inspirational and it promotes love and compassion.  Unfortunately the people who most need to see it probably won't watch it.  Still, this story is so heart-warming that it will have a lasting impact on many.",1236124800,,932,4.612121212121212

We may never meet again

We won't say good night until the last minute
I will hold out my hand
And my heart, my heart will be in it"" Sam Lewis

Mrs Palfrey, played by Joan Plowrighty and her husband, loved the song 'For All We Know' and it is sung by Rosemary Clooney to the closing credits. The film is a delightful British film that is particularly special because of the actors.

 Mrs Palfrey leaves her home in Scotland to move to London. She wants to be partially independent after her husband dies, and she needs to get away from her overbearing daughter. She chose London because her grandson worked there in the archives of the British museum.  The Claremont is a hotel paid for by the month, with a room, three meals a day with white tablecloths and filled with various and sundry older people all waiting to die, but they are not allowed to die at the Claremont.

Mrs Palfrey has hopes that her grandson will come to visit her, but the ingrate never answers her calls.  One day she inadvertently trips, and a young man stops to help her. He brings her to his apartment to cleanse her wounds. He is a writer with multiple part time jobs and they form a friendship.  Ludvic is his name and he comes to dinner at the Claremont. Mrs Palfrey becomes the grandmother he never had, and Ludvic becomes her grandson. They recite poetry and visit museums and castles. Ludvic geos out one day to find the film 'Brief Encounters' that is Mrs Palfrey favorite film. He meets a young woman who loves the film, watches it with her, and fal in love. Mrs Palfrey becomes part of their lives.

This is a lovely film, with brilliant acting. The older folk at the Claremont are the ones you might expect to meet. Joan Plowright is exceptional ss Mrs Palfrey.  Everyone who has a special bond with their grandmother would like this film. Beautifully filmed.

So nice to see that there are still some decent movies out there without all the flashy nudity and vulgarity that most movie makers these days think are needed to sell a film - except for one profanity (which was so obvious because it was so out-of place in this movie), a clean movie which kept our interest, made us smile, and happy that we made the purchase.",1234656000,,483,4.260869565217392

2624722,5,B000GYI3PY,"I discovered this fascinating film while reviewing Joan Plowright's filmography at imdb.com. That I missed it at my local art house is unfortunate, for I'd have loved to witness it on the big screen.  Still, it has become one of my very favorites, and I watch it often, happily.  I somehow feel cocooned in a warm, comfortable blanket while I watch the interplay of the main characters, almost as if I was ensconced before a fireplace.

Ms. Plowright is one of the finest actresses I know, going all the way back to ""Enchanted April,""  Here she is wonderfully matched with Rupert Friend, who I'd never seen before, as the leading man.  Somehow they create an ersatz familial love of the most wonderful sort!

This one ranks right up there with ""An Affair To Remember"" in my book!",1230508800,,779,4.649635036496351

Plowright's appearance was the only other redeeming factor.

The cast is magically interwoven in such way that all become family and create the very best outcome for a story that is alive within society each day, yet seems to be unseen and not acknowledged. Our elders are not supported or respected as well they should be.

Joan tells the story through the greatest piece of acting I have seen for many a year, between herself and her young friend, they wrap the viewer safely within the story, so safely, that understanding about growing older fills one's being. A wonderful movie and ever so true to life.

I loved Joan Plowright's character, Mrs. Sara Palfrey, a lovable, smart, independent widow, who wants to be involved in her adult daughter & adult grandson's lives without be a burden or bother to them. Mrs. Palfrey takes up residence at The Claremont Hotel in London, which she reads about. While at the Claremont, Mrs. Palfrey quickly makes friends with the other elderly people living there too. Mrs. Palfrey hopes her grandson, Desmond, will visit her at the Claremont, but he seems too busy with his own life to be involved with his grandmother, so see very little of both Desmond or his mother during the movie.

Fate has it that Mrs. Palfrey should met and become friends with a young writer named, Ludovic Meyer. The two make an unlikely pair of friends & they become closer then many family members do. Ludovic Meyer's dad died long ago and Ludovic isn't close with his mom. With Mrs. Palfrey, being widowed and not close with her daughter or grandson, Mrs. Palfrey & Ludovic Meyer spend many a memorable times together and are great friends.

When widowed Mrs. Sarah Palfrey (Joan Plowright) decides to not be a burden on her daughter, she moves into the Claremont Hotel in London.  It's quite a disappointment from what she was hoping, but she makes do with amazing spirit. Unfortunately, neither her daughter or her grandson have time to visit her or even return her calls.

One day a fortunate fall places her in the hands of young writer, Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend).  The pair are drawn to each other from the beginning and when she invites him to dinner, the other folks at the home believe that he's the grandson she's been extolling.  Neither Mrs. P. nor Ludo are willing to dissuade them, so they keep up the relationship.  Mrs. P. gets a chance at seeing the world through a young man's eyes and Ludo learns about the classics including Mrs. P.'s favorite film, which coincidentally gets him introduced to the love of his life.

This ia a grand tale told only as the British could with elegance and understatement.  Watch out for Rupert Friend.  We will be seeing him again and I hope for big things from this talented young actor.

Truth is, the Claremont has seen better days!  The place is seedy, her room very small and there is not a comfortable chair in sight! The residents are a mix of elderly and very lonely people, just like her.

Mrs. Palfrey (Joan Plowright) is a pleasant woman. Living in London seemed like a good way to connect with her only grandson, who works at a museum and in her mind she pictures him lunching with her on Sundays.  After the move, she tries and tries to reach him by telephone, but weeks go by without his returning her phone calls. She settles in to thinking he will never visit her.

Good things are never completely the way that we picture them to be and Mrs. Palfrey does make a few friends with the residents.  She also meets and is befriended by a young man who is helpful to her. When she eventually has her grandson  to visit, it's more than wonderful.  He's charming, handsome and the other residents are delighted to have the chance to get to know him too. Trouble is, there is much more to the story

Widowed, and definitely genteel and aristocratic, she moves to what the advertisement leads her to believe is a grand and pleasant hotel in England. She has moved in hopes of being near her daughter and grandson, while still retaining her independence. She soon finds that the hotel is a dreary, uninspiring place.

By chance, our heroine meets a kindred spirit, the young musician and writer, Ludwig. This meeting results in an important, significant friendship, and he decides to write her story - ""Mrs. Palfry at the Claremont.""

Among other things, this story seems to relate how our relatives, and those we think of as our friends, may not always be the most loyal, intimate person, at all, but sometimes new acquaintances and friends turn out to be the ones who are really understanding, really present, and who make all the biggest difference in our lives.",1191628800,2,1054,4.943502824858757

The permanent guests are an interesting assortment and a ""family"" atmosphere emerges. Mrs. Palfrey's family leaves something to be desired (her daughter is wrapped up in her own life, and her grandson isn't any better).  Feeling the need to present an errant grandson to her fellow guests, Mrs. Palfrey ""adopts"" a young man she mets in London, and the story takes off from there. Personally, I found it refreshing, funny, sad, and left me feeling good after watching it. If you like a film that will touch your heart and leave you with a good feel - this is it!

Everything is a stereotype: the elderly are mentally defective and dying to be sexy and fun; the young hippy in the story is ever-so-sensitive and good; the ""words of wisdom"" by the major character (Plowright) are superficial to the point of being humorous.

I enjoyed the handsome Rupert Friend's perfect portrayal of the kind, young stranger who befriends his new neighbor. I enjoyed the lovely Claremont hotel. I enjoyed both the residents and employees of the hotel. I enjoyed the neighborhood, which appeared to be a natural setting. I enjoyed the story of a grandmother who lives alone, has difficulty connecting with her family, but finds reason and goodness in others. I was very comfortable in that story, in that setting, with those people. I could have stayed longer, but the story ended just as I got settled in. It ended quickly and quietly, before I was prepared for it to end. In most movies I can see the end coming. This one surprised me, maybe because I was so comfortable.

2624764,5,B000GYI3PY,"She came from a world of sensible choices;
nothing in her life had prepared her for the loud confusion of her
unexpected present.

 So begins the enchanting journey of ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"" a journey of discovery, renewal, affirmation and connection.

 Mrs. Palfrey is a widow of some years, just moved to London to take up residence at the Hotel Claremont upon, of all things, the strength of a magazine ad which ""mentioned excellent cuisine.""  Hoping for elegance in spite of the Claremont's unexpectedly doughty appearance, she arrives in the dining room on her first night in her going-to-theater best, eager to make a good first impression on her fellow residents.  But rather than the storied salon of the Titanic, she finds herself in something of a commissary for cast-offs, a sparse room thinly populated with oddballs at assorted tables-for-one.  An eternity later she realizes that only ten minutes have in fact passed, and Mrs. Palfrey comprehends that she may have gotten herself into something other than that which she expected.

 But before the deadening gloom, maddening sameness, and reruns of Sex in the City can fully mummify her, a chance accident brings a young man, a seemingly aimless 20-something writer, into her life...and everything changes.  Too embarrassed to correct them when her fellow residents mistake the young man for her long-awaited and decidedly absent grandson, she finds herself playing surrogate grandmother when their ruse becomes permanent.  In him she finds the first friend of her new life; in her he finds the reassurance to be and believe in himself.

 Beautifully filmed and scored, intelligently written and acted, ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"" is warm without being sappy, insightful without being preachy, and clever without being silly.  The cast is simply perfect.

 Nothing in her life may have prepared Mrs. Palfrey for what she found at the Claremont; but she nonetheless faces it with an inspiring and infectious gusto that will make any viewer from twenty to seventy quietly pray that they will have half as much spirit in the December of their years.

 This is, quite simply, a movie not to be missed.",1181606400,11,2176,5.081690140845071
2624765,5,B000GYI3PY,"""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont"" really couldn't miss with Dame Joan Plowright in the title role, but Rupert Friend is also a treasure.  The story reveals the loneliness of the human condition and the joy of a true connection between individuals, no matter how diverse their lives.  The film also highlights the need to belong and the fear of self-exposure that sometimes overshadows that need.  Highly recommended for those who can enjoy the quieter, more character-driven film.",1181347200,2,478,5.181818181818182

2624767,4,B000GYI3PY,". This is a warm tale of change and friendship. The acting by all the supporting members of the Palfrey is fully developed. My favorite was the character played by the always estimable Anne Massey. Joan Plowright is at the top of her trade as the lonely and ""what am I doing here"" widow. She is ablely met with Rupert Friend. I would have liked more of the grandson ,more than just the typical ""twit""By and large , it was fairly predictable but it was done well and without being too syrupy",1178928000,4,490,4.336956521739131

For those who don't think the story is realistic in that a young man would befriend an older woman - you're very wrong as I know several young men who are very comfortable in the company of motherly and grandmotherly types and while they haven't been called upon to masquerade as someone they are not, they delight in spending time with older people.",1172880000,7,535,4.383838383838384

The only thing wrong with it is that it didn't get the attention and acclaim that it deserved and that too many people called the plot unrealistic because the characters were so nice to each other.  There's something deeply wrong with the world when a story of friendship is deemed unrealistic and movies made about serial killers aren't.

We should try to remedy that by supporting this movie and others like it and emulating the behavior in it.  Buy several copies of this one and give them as gifts.",1172793600,6,664,4.5
2624776,5,B000GYI3PY,"One chance meeting, two changed lives. I suggest before you watch the DVD you listen to the narrative of the producer and director which is a value add on the DVD. It will give you great4er insight into this delightful film that seems timeless. An elegant wido Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Paltrey who moves into a residence hotel called the Claremont in London. Instead of it being a cosmopolitan boutique hotel, it turns out to be one of those forgettable places with the bath down the hall. A chance meeting with a dashing young writer Rubert Friend changes both of their lives. They were meant to meet. NO this is not a may/december love story but it is a romance of a certain kind. A nice valentine to any age who doesn't know that love comes in many places and ways in our lives. And it's important to embrace it and accept it and be grateful for what crosses our path. Family of choice is sometimes so much more meaningful than family of chance (the one you're born into). This was an indy film made for $1 million on location in London -- amazing quality and a charming script. Bravo.",1171152000,100,1089,4.45
2624777,5,B000GYI3PY,"After the film came to an end (I'd rented it on DVD), a friend who had enjoyed it with us said, ""Where did you hear about this movie?""  And I wasn't quite sure where I'd first seen mention of the film until, in watching an extra on the DVD, Joan Plowright's acceptance speech as winner of a best actress award from AARP, I realized it had been in a recent AARP magazine I'd received.  If we lived in a just world, then Joan Plowright's performance as Mrs. Palfrey would have received an Academy Award nomination last year.  When one considers what passes for entertainment nowadays, this film can stand head and shoulders above so many.  No sense giving you a rundown on the story itself; suffice it to say that, if you've any curiosity as to what ageing will be like, if you've any curiosity as to how those moving into their later senior years deal with the good and bad of growing older, this movie will enlighten you.  And this chance possibility of paths crossing, lives changed, the opportunity to grow from a chance encounter and a friendship formed are all beautifully explored in this wonderful little film.  Rupert Friend delightfully holds his own as he and Ms Plowright form what might seem like an unlikely but beautiful friendship.  There is nary a false move in his performance nor hers.  I'm buying a DVD copy of my own to share with my many senior friends who, I'm sure, have yet to enjoy this story.",1171152000,236,1417,4.529411764705882
2624778,3,B000GYI3PY,"This is the sort of movie you want to like - and it does have some touching moments. But in the end, the intergenerational friendship portrayed here is just not believable. How often would a handsome young man rush out to help an elderly woman who has fallen in front of his apartment, scoop her up, invite her inside, bandage her bruise, serve her tea, and then befriend her and serve as her proxy son? This is especially true if the older woman turns out to be rather uninteresting.

Yet that's what happens here. Joan Plowright is a distinguished actress with limpid, expressive eyes - but she isn't given much to do in this movie other than to be accepting and relatively sane compared to some of the mild eccentrics arcing around her in the hotel where she takes up residence. She really doesn't have anything profound or funny to say. The young man, and we the viewers, have to do all the work of imputing wisdom to her.

This film does provide some interesting backward glances of pockets of old-fashioned London that staunchly persist into the modern world. There is the retirement hotel itself, where people still come down to occupy their reserved places for breakfast, in that Terrence Rattigan ""Separate Tables"" way that one of the characters remarks on. There are the drizzly London streets flanked by the black wrought iron grills.

However in general, this is a sort of forced fairy tale, right through to its sanitized ""Love Story"" scene. It holds up the possibility for the sort of unlikely friendship that a lot of us, me included, might wistfully daydream about. But unfortunately, this movie doesn't have much to say about the real world.",1170892800,9,1658,4.75
2624779,5,B000GYI3PY,"Just when you think that most current films preach, frighten, annoy and frustrate with their subject matter, along comes what could be described as an old fashioned ""feel good"" film.

Joan Plowwright has always grasped her characters with an intellence that ranges from bright humor to deeply felt human emotion.  One marvels at her ability to get into whatever role she is portraying and often rise above the material and in some cases her fellow actors.  She is wonderful to watch.

Mrs. Plafrey at the Calremont reminds one of the wonderful stories one read as a child or young person with sharply defined characterizations and lovely exterior and interior scenes.  The interaction of the various characters mirrors life story elements which everyone can idenify with and be sympathetic with.  First, this is not a film which focuses a ""tied up with a ribbon"" story.  It covers the ambiguious nature of relationships and compels us to think about our own lives and how we react and respond to others in our lives.  Most importanly, it allows us to celebrate the magesty of caring, love and regard which makes life truly worth living.  A very refreshing element of this film is the beautifully balanced act the ensemble of actors perform.  Even though there are many well know Brit actors we have seen on Masterpiece Theatre and other British films who are first-rate in their own right, none trys to outdo or overshadow even in what might be termed ""cameo"" roles. This is special in itself.
