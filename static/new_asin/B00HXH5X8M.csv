First, let me say that I am a fan of Movie Serials from the 40s and 50s, especially Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, the Green Hornet, the Phantom, etc, but I had never heard of the ""Adventures of Smilin' Jack"" (and quite frankly the name kind of turned me off), but I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Plenty of action, great sets, great cliff hangers, and the acting (well it is a movie serial from the 40s after all)......

One device that I really liked was the re-cap at the beginning of each episode. On several other Movie Serials, the last 2 -3 minutes of each episode is ""exactly"" re-run in the first 2 - 3 minutes of the next episode. When this was run in theaters on a weekly basis I guess this was fine, but when you watch serials today (usually several chapters in a row), this gets very monotonous. However, in this serial, the beginning of each episode is a brand new scene, usually with the actors discussing / recapping what has just taken place (either explaining to another actor or talking to someone on the telephone), followed by maybe 20 to 30 second of rerun footage. While this is still a rehash of what just took place, it is a  fresh new approach, and feels like the creators of the serial made a effort and spent a little extra time and effort to enhance the story.

A couple of personal comments, for those not familiar with movies from the 40s, there are some references to the Japanese (and to a smaller extent the Germans)  that is not exactly PC (by today's standards), but after all we were at war at the time (and I have heard and seen far worse).

I am sure that someone else can explain the sound and look of the picture in much more technical detail then I could, I can only say that I had no problem viewing or hearing the film, with maybe some very minor issues (but after all it is over 70 years old).

Once again great job by VCI Entertainment, keep up the great work guys....

Finally, if you are not a fan of Movie Serials (or Black and White movies in general) than I cannot help you, but if you are a fan of old movies / old Movie Serials, then give this a try, you will not be disappointed.",1413504000,3,3637,4.509118541033435
