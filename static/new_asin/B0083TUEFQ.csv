5126697,3,B0083TUEFQ,"If you're a fan of Todd Barry, then you're no stranger to Todd's delivery style and ""gay timing."" However, his material in Super Crazy wasn't doing it for me. It's not that you won't laugh at all because it's still Todd and you can't beat his raspy sarcasm. But the jokes didn't go far enough and stayed too linear to get the big laugh.  It's all pretty much new material, but i didn't take away the jokes like i did with his classics previous bits such as the Ramada In, i <3 roe vs wade,  sisqo's bidet, and  Coke vs. Pepsi. Which is ironic because i looove Todd Barry, but i didn't love Super Crazy.

...I can hear it now how Todd might complain about this review on stage, ""i was reading the first and only review on amazon for the last special i did, it was 3 stars, and the guy used the phrase ""too linear""...

Anyways, if you're a fan you should buy it and support him. If you're new to Todd, i would start with his earlier albums because those are his masterpieces.",1344384000,5,973,4.209677419354839

5126711,5,B0083TUEFQ,"Can't find the words to express how really crazy Todd Barry is.  His gags are always in my mind.  ""Always been this way? Then why do you DO it this way? I think it must not be a GOOD way!""  ""I just thought of a smoking hot idea how to get a little old lady's purse"".  ""I once supervised a transgender lawn crew"".  It never ends.",1431734400,,328,3.909090909090909

5126714,5,B0083TUEFQ,His first album nailed his approach and this album parodies it with more of the same. I love it and can't get enough of it. He can't write fast enough. It is comforting to know he's such a good actor and equally hilarious.,1381708800,,222,4.186046511627907

Having said that it still had enough laughs and Todd Barry to be a hit.
If you like this you;ll love Todd's other CDs.",1375660800,,189,3.75
5126716,5,B0083TUEFQ,"This is a classic comedy DVD.  It would work as a CD, too, but his facial expressions and body language add a lot to the humor.  I hope you does more Comedy Central specials!",1359504000,,174,4.088235294117647
5126717,5,B0083TUEFQ,"I'm not normally compelled to write reviews, but as a Todd Barry fan who enjoyed the show I felt it necessary as there was only one other review and it was 3 stars.

I'm ashamed it took me this long to know it was out, but I have watched it the past two days and have enjoyed it thoroughly. Any Todd Barry fan should not think twice and just pick it up.

As the performance goes, stellar delivery as always and I really enjoyed the new material.  It didn't have me slapping my knees a lot because of the way I was sitting, but there were plenty of knee slapping moments.

I will say that he did have a lot to say about New York City, I'm so over that city.",1355356800,,656,3.984732824427481

8524742,3,B0083TUEFQ,His delivery is like Dennis Miller on Quaalude. He is very funny but had a tendency to drag some jokes out too long. I was disappointed that I had already heard most of the jokes on the radio.,1474675200,,192,4.078947368421052

8524744,1,B0083TUEFQ,"One star is supposed to indicate ""I hate it"" but,  I think ""I hate it"" is too harsh a rating to give for anyone that chooses a comedy act in lieu of a movie. Now, I have to sarcastically ask, ""Are there any comics out there that use jokes in there act now a days? It's simple; set up the crowed, throw in a twist, relate it to the set up and if your delivery is worked out - you got a punch line! I love it when a joke is complex enough for me not to be able to repeat it with the same results, ""You have to hear him say it for yourself, he was funny!"" That's what I want to say  more that only 10% of the time.",1464566400,,611,3.6564885496183206
