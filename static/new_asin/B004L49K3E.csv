8433814,2,B004L49K3E,"Michael (Ty Jones ) and his wife Tina (Mandy Bannon) appear to be stressed out for no other reason than they want to be. He buys an abandoned warehouse to start his own concrete business. As the unhappy couple walks it down, they are taken prisoner and tortured by a man who has apparently targeted them and knows all about their lives having recordings that are not possible.

The torture scenes are long and drawn out. There is blood, but it was boring, lay flat blood and nothing that squirts. Michael's affair seems to be at the heart of the matter.

The film is confusing as to what is going on, even with the modest slasher clue in the beginning. Once I found out, I felt major league disappointment.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Near sex scene. No nudity.",1403395200,,758,4.518248175182482
8433815,3,B004L49K3E,The movie rolls after the first half hour of exposition then kicks posterior until resolution which is largely contrived.  If I were this director/writer I would keep at it.  There is promise in there.,1371340800,2,201,4.882352941176471
8433816,4,B004L49K3E,"Ive seen this film a couple of times. I saw it last at the 2010 Estes Park Film Festival where it won a Best Feature award. Check out the link to the movie and you'll see that its won the same award at several festivals.

Its got a great bad guy character that Aaron Laue brings to the screen. Ty Jones plays the Lead Actor but he entices the audience through this film telling them a story with a meaning via a Horror Film as the Director.

There are some pretty intense moments via a torture scene and a couple of really well filmed gore scenes...

I prefer a great story on film, like this one, as opposed to 30 million bucks wasted on lame CGI and bad acting.

This film is going to leave you looking for more Ty Jones titles.",1302739200,10,730,4.119718309859155
