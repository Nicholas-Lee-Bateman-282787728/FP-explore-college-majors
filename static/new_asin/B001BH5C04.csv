8283199,2,B001BH5C04,"This is my favorite depiction of the life of Martin Luther. Focusing on his life between about 1510 and 1522, it depicts his developing theological awareness, his critique of the indulgence system, and his growing disaffection with the Roman papacy. It ends with his decision to come out of hiding and take leadership of the Reforming movement in Wittenberg in 1522. For the story and the acting, I would rate it five stars. However, this DVD was copied from VHS. Its visual effect is muddied and uncomfortable to watch.",1470960000,,520,4.853932584269663

8283201,1,B001BH5C04,The quality of this was not what you'd expect from a legal copy.  It would be nice to have the assurance that we are buying legal copies of movies on Amazon.com.  The photo of the packaging is misleading.  You only get a bare slip pocket for the disk and a black and white title burned onto the disc by anyone's disc burning app.,1425340800,,329,4.190476190476191
8283202,3,B001BH5C04,"This movie was a very well made introduction to some of the most tumultuous years of Martin Luther's life. It's comparable to the more recent movie, Luther, though this story doesn't shy away from out and out theological discussion.

My only complaint is that the quality of the picture on the DVD is about that of a well worn VHS tape. I almost wonder if they took the movie from youtube...",1395619200,,391,4.507042253521127
8283203,5,B001BH5C04,"This is the best dramatization of Martin Luther I have seen. Although apparently low-budget, it is well acted and scripted. It centers on the main issue of Luther's life and the Reformation: the gospel. It does an excellent job of describing the theological issues at stake but in a way accessible to nearly everyone. I've watched it repeatedly and screened it repeatedly for my church and church history classes. It was made by the BBC in 1983 for the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's birth. Only recently have used versions been available in the US. It's worthy of wide distribution.",1287705600,9,589,4.9
