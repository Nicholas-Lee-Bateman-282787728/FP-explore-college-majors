8548809,5,B00A9YBW9K,Well written. well acted police drama.  Holds my interest and seems to have fresh material.  This is an excellent series.,1513468800,,121,5.0
8548810,4,B00A9YBW9K,"Let me get this out of the way, mads is horrible on tv's hannibal, ( only experience I have had with his body of work,) in my opinion, so i wasn't expecting much. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because, I wasn't immediately smitten, from the beginning, the way i have been with shows like wallander, beck, a mind to kill, arne dahl, montalbano. brunetti,  etc. by the second dvd, I was on board.
Well written-stories, fr the headlines, like law and order, but since they occurred in denmark, they are new to us. Love the characters/their outside stories, and of course the beautiful scenery. this is keeper. Enjoy",1432857600,,621,4.544642857142857

8548813,5,B00A9YBW9K,"This series was broadcast on a local MHZ channel which is no longer around. The 12 or 20 episodes I saw were terrific! I am waiting to see if it will be available in a USA DVD format so I can buy it and watch it again and share it with my son. I bought a PAL format DVD a while ago and it went ""defunked"" so I am not doing that again. So I will wait and hope it becomes available. I highly recommend it because each character is very acted and well developed... it's not your typical USA crime drama where the story lines are weak and their series rely more on how pretty the actors are, and not on how ""realistic/fully developed"". I also followed the series with a map of Denmark because they mention specific, real locations so you get a good impression of the Danish landscape. Great for people who have not traveled there. In 2002, Unit One won the International Emmy Award for best drama series. You can read more about it on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejseholdet",1405728000,3,982,4.430939226519337
8548814,5,B00A9YBW9K,"I bought this because I'm a huge Mads Mikkelsen fan. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of acting and the engaging story lines. The dvd is in Danish with English subtitles, but is easy to follow. I have already seen series 2 & 3, and will be ordering 4 when it's available.",1400025600,2,299,4.172413793103448
8548815,5,B00A9YBW9K,"As an American I find it extremely interesting to see another take on a cop show.  Loved the program and the cast.  Especially my ""boyfriend Mads"". LOL",1381276800,9,151,4.555555555555555
8548816,5,B00A9YBW9K,"I am enjoying this series (a KIND person gave me an 11 DVD set of it -- no English subtitles, though).  The actors are terrific, and the stories move well.  The crimes are based on real-life crimes, so that they are not as sensational as what we see in THE BRIDGE or GIRL WITH A DRAGON TATTOO.  In fact, often they are depressingly familiar.  But that also means that the cops occasionally feel bad for the criminal (not always!!), and the events may be presented as much as a tragedy as a crime.

As another reviewer noted, one final strength is the fact that this is about a top notch crime team that gets sent all over Denmark to solve crimes where the locals are stumped.  Especially after the first few episodes, which has some annoying crosscutting which prevents you from seeing much of anything,  we get to see a lot of different locales: landscapes, villages, small towns, and depressing working class neighborhoods.  Denmark sure is not all Hans Christian Andersen!

Aside from the core group of cops (who are all excellent), you get lots of cameos from different actors.  Finally a young Mads Mikkelsen delivers some solid proof of why he deserves his successful career.",1380585600,10,1181,4.689320388349515
8548817,3,B00A9YBW9K,"Those who enjoyed ""the Killing"" will be quite disappointed.  This series is far less interesting.  The writing is mediocre as is the acting.",1379808000,,140,5.043478260869565
8548818,5,B00A9YBW9K,"This series is of the same quality as the more recent ones from Scandinavia (The Bridge,
The Killing, Irene Huss, Maria Wern). Actors are great, as well as the filming and the
sceneries. This ones lets us see a bit of Denmark outside Copenhagen, it also has
a bit of humor, such as the cop asking a talking bird in a bar if he's seen the suspect
(third episode). Each episode is upbeat, with lots of energy, but not without this touch
of European subtlety generally lacking North American production.",1371340800,8,500,4.566666666666666
