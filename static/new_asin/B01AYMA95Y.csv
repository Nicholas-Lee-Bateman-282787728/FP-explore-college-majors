7614362,5,B01AYMA95Y,"First and most important: Yes, a 19 year old guy can see this movie in theaters. By himself.
 I saw this movie yesterday, and it was a pretty good continuation of the series, near perfect. Like the previous Kung Fu Pandas, there was quite a bit of humor, some of it unnecessary, but it didn't get to much in the way of the dramatic story they were trying to tell. Since this story is about Po finding his real father, it takes some time to slow down, and let you see what the life of the pandas is like, but even with that, doesn't disappoint if you are looking for a great action film. The animation, and scenery is awesome as well, and obviously is cool.
 My biggest problem with the film though, is the portrayal of the spirit world, although cool in appearance, it sort of seems like a depressing place to spend eternity in, even if you don't believe that sort of thing. Actually, thinking about it, (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the biggest problem may have been the timing. The film opened up in the spirit world to show Kia's escape, but maybe it would have been much better to have waited to show the spirit world (HUGE SPOILER) later in the film to when Po arrives, and let you see it the first time there. (END OF SPOILER) Now that would have been awesome. I recommend skipping the first scene the first time you watch it, and watch it later, I don't think it's too necessary the first time.
 So right now, I'm giving this four stars, but maybe I'll change it to five next time I see it on DVD.

UPDATE: I just gave it 5 Stars. The first scene is a problem still, but you probably only need to avoid it if you're watching it your first time, or if you're planning on watching all the films in order.",1454284800,2,1698,4.263975155279503
7614363,5,B01AYMA95Y,"Went to see it with my wife and 2 year old Friday morning, then again the same with my 8 year old when she was out of school.  My wife and I really enjoyed the last two and this one did not disappoint, although I was a bit tired the second time and one can only have so much popcorn.  We were in the theater laughing out load. My 2 year old lost interest and took a nap in the last 20 min, but then again she is only 2.  My 8 year old love it as much if not more than my wife and I did.  It's a great family movie, highly recommend. Will definitely be getting the DVD.",1454284800,11,568,3.7083333333333335
7614364,5,B01AYMA95Y,"Stop and go see this movie on the big screen. Great story, and the best animation I have seen in quite some time",1454198400,,112,3.9130434782608696
7614365,4,B01AYMA95Y,Continues to impress with great direction by Alessandro Carloni. A great followup for everyone to enjoy. You can read my review here at: thecinemascore.com,1454198400,,155,5.5
7614366,5,B01AYMA95Y,"this is a awesome movie. i think that this is the best one in the series so far. the story is great, the animation is great, and  the characters are awesome. in this third installment of these series we find po finding his roots when his real dad comes to china to find him. meanwhile a old rival of oogway's is planning an escape from the spirit world to take over china and everyone's chi. this is such a great movie. can po defeat this new threat. you will see when you go see kung fu panda 3. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1454025600,3,552,4.0181818181818185

7614382,2,B01AYMA95Y,Mmmm..... not so much. I didn't like some of the language that my kiddos started quoting from this. Definitely not as good as the first one.,1515542400,,140,4.423076923076923

7614385,4,B01AYMA95Y,"Note that I am /not/ in the target age group. For them, this film is probably even better!
It is well-done, tells a story, and points a moral. What more could a PG-aged person want?
This follows on the end of /Kung Fu Panda 2/, reuniting our hero with his family.
Meanwhile, a villain appears (this should be no surprise; a villain always appears) and eventually threatens Po's Panda family.
Can Po defeat an enemy with the power of all the other kung fu masters?
See the film and find out!",1515369600,,490,4.395604395604396

7614387,5,B01AYMA95Y,"More legends of awesomeness as the happy Po enlarges his family when reunited with his biological panda dad and an extended panda enclave.  The little bits of anxiousness and over-protectiveness from Pos adoptive goose dad are spot on and speak to the fears of the adoptive parent when the child theyve given their life and love to finds their genetic connection.  But as sometimes happens there is room enough in everyones hearts for more family and Pos naivety works in everyones favor.  The bullish villain is again just a device to bring people together and help them, and Po, see the secrets and strength that is already locked inside of themselves.  This movie is a far better sequel than the second iteration but what a great and fun series.",1513987200,,748,4.775193798449612

7614414,2,B01AYMA95Y,"Big fan of the first two films; the second was a masterpiece in its own way. The third, however, was uninspired and felt more like it was merely an obligatory installment. I didn't care for what they did with Master Oogway's character and thought the ending was just too over the top to have any emotional impact or payoff.",1498953600,,323,4.491525423728813

I googled the issue to find out that the settings will allow the switch four times and will then permanently lock on your last selection.

7614466,5,B01AYMA95Y,"Without a doubt, Kung Fu Panda 3 is the best installment of the Kung Fu Panda franchise from DreamWorks! I loved the story and the characters! The other pandas in the film, including Li, Po's biological father (voiced by Bryan Cranston of Malcolm in the Middle and Breaking Bad fame) are exceptionally cute and they have nice clothing! This installment does with its message about the importance of family (especially your biological family)! Makes me wish I had a family as awesome as Po's! Also, you've got an awesome villain voiced by Oscar winner, J.K. Simmons, you probably recognize him as the spokesperson for Farmer's Insurance, Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum!)!

All in all, this an exceptionally well done sequel and is a much better sequel than the second one! If you haven't watched Kung Fu Panda 3, check it out! It's exceptionally well done for both kids and adults!",1488758400,,876,4.7631578947368425

7614471,4,B01AYMA95Y,"Should there be anyone left in the world unsure of DreamWorks incredible sensibilities when it comes to producing quality, endearing computer generated feature films, a dose of Kung Fu Panda 3 should be all thats required to squish any doubts.

The third edition of the Kung Fu Panda film franchise (not counting a host of holiday themed mini movies, shorts, an animated series etc.) came to us on January 29th, 2016 with a run-time of 95-minutes.  It was built on a budget of $145-million and managed to gross $521.2-mil worldwide by the time it completed its theatrical run.

In most film series the third iteration begins to feel a bit tired but Kung Fu Panda 3 avoids all of the usual trappings by offering up perhaps the strongest emotional connection of the franchise to date.  The story opens with the happenings of the spirit realm and the late Grand master Oogways (Randall Duk Kim) ongoing struggles with an enchanted-blade wielding yak named Kai (J. K. Simmons).

Kai, it turns out, has mastered the ancient art of capturing chi and turning the life force of those hes imprisoned into emeralds that he keeps on a chain.  It is only in capturing the chi of Oogway that Kai is powerful enough to enter the mortal realm where he finds Po (Jack Black) in the awkward transition from student to teacher.

Things get ugly in a hurry when Po discovers training the Furious Five; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Monkey (Jackie Chan), isn't near as effortless as Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) made it look.  Stymied and humiliated, Po is taught that he needs to find himself to fulfill his destiny as the Dragon Warrior.

Further complicating things, he discovers his real father (Bryan Cranston) in a chance encounter in town just as Kais zombie minions begin to unleash their havoc upon the land.

Under the fluid and beautifully paced direction of Jennifer Yuh Nelson (who helmed Kung Fu Panda 2) and Alessandro Carloni, the third film is never in danger of feeling like a retread; but instead offers up a whole new dimension to the established mythos with poise and grace.

Perhaps most impressive here is the depiction of an older, slightly wiser Po without ever compromising the characters immature enthusiasm.  Thankfully, there was no need to demonstrate the passage of time here by making Po married with children or any other such similar cliche, rather an ending sequence where Oogway passes the proverbial torch onto Po with pride beautifully says it all without having to say much.  You feel the maturation that accompanied Pos journey from the first film all those years ago.

Add to this a perfectly written score from Hans Zimmer and the entire experience feels soaring, tense at times and always laced with just the right amount of comedic relief.

Back in 2010, DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg announced that the Kung Fu Panda franchise was planned to have six movies, or ""chapters"", altogether.  If thats still true, were only halfway through the saga and while DreamWorks can be known to stretch things out a little longer than necessary at times (Shrek or Madagascar, anyone?), the truth of the matter is Kung Fu Panda has proven some series actually get stronger as time goes on.",1488326400,,3273,4.88086642599278

7614608,4,B01AYMA95Y,"Up next in my continuing saga of missing movies in the theater comes Kung Fu Panda 3.  Since Id enjoyed the first two, I really did intend to see it when it came out, but somehow, that didn't quite happen.  But now thats it out on Blu-Ray I was able to catch up on the adventures of the Kung Fu Dragon Master Po.  As always, they are fun.

Po (voiced by Jack Black) is about to get the surprise of his life.  His master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has decided to retire to pursue the next level of enlightenment through meditation.  He feels that Po is ready to train the rest of the Furious Five.  But when the first training session ends in disaster, Po heads to his fathers noodle restaurant.

And its at the restaurant where Po gets another surprise.  In walks Li Shang (Bryan Cranston), his long lost Panda father.  While Po is thrilled to finally meet him and travel to the panda village, his adopted father Mr. Ping (James Hong) is less than happy.

But the timing couldn't be better.  Kai (J. K. Simmons) has returned from the dead.  This Kung Fu master also desires to master meditation.  While he doesnt have everything down, he can bend others to his will, something he starts doing to the Kung Fu masters he meets on his travels across China.  The pandas actually hold the secrets, but can Po learn them in time?  And can Po teach them enough Kung Fu to defeat Kai when he shows up?

Lets get my complaint out of the way first.  Weve seen this movie before.  Not only is the plot familiar from other similar movies, but it is the basic plot of the first two movies.  Change the villain and what Po must learn, and we have this sequel.  But it is a sequel after all, and thats what most of them are.

And thats not to say that it is a bad thing.  The plot still works.  While I wasn't caught up in every second of it, I was certainly anxious to find out just how Po would wind up defeating the villain.

Naturally, the characters help.  All the old characters are back, and we meet an entire new batch of pandas when we get to the village.  They are adorable and a wonderful addition to the franchise.

But the best part?  The humor.  There are lots of laughs as Po learns the way of the panda and teaches them Kung Fu.  The jokes come effortlessly and are delightful.

While this movie doesnt have any money shots like Pixar films often do, the animation is great.  The voice actors are just as wonderful as always as well, and its easy to get caught up in the characters and the story they are telling.

So if youve enjoyed the franchise, don't hesitate to see Kung Fu Panda 3.  Youll laugh as you enjoy catching Pos latest adventures.",1481241600,,2643,4.292089249492901

The methods he and his friends use, makes your heart glad. Great Family movie  and worth keeping on your library.

There is always a great lesson to be had, while they teach you don't have to be perfect to be great. That lesson is invaluable now a days. To use a force of characters to inhabit different personalities is a great task. At the same time they don't use crude humor to entice adults to watch it at the same time. The movie is good enough for all ages to be entertained and keep watching each series and not be disappointed. After all, who comes out with a part three and it is still great! So kudos to Kung Fu Panda for putting out a great concept that all ages can love and enjoy time after time.",1475884800,,755,4.006622516556291

I saw the first two films in the series, and while I loved the first and not the second, this was as lovable as the original. The humor, the story line, all were very well-crafted in this one.
I loved the story, especially. It actually went somewhere and I saw a few good teachings that I would hope small kids would catch. (Even if I had to point them out... lol)
The action was there, and there was tons of it, but it was put in a way that isn't going to make your child think they need to beat everyone. On the contrary. It may have them wishing they were a panda though.
Definitely a hit, and definitely one to make the choice for family night!

It is always fun, entertaining, and since we use Amazon instant video, there isn't a disk to scratch, break or lose.

I identify with Po, being as out of shape as I am and look a little like him too, so any time I feel ridiculous in dance, yoga, and other classes, I just think of him and it works for me.

My son has started working on his kung fu moves, and although he could sharpen up his technique, it is nice to see him so inspired as well.",1473465600,,607,4.0

7614943,5,B01AYMA95Y,"This time around Po the Panda is the teacher but he's bumbling through that (as usual).  When his long-lost father appears, he's overjoyed though his foster father isn't. Immediately a menace arises, keeping everyone busy as Kai, a threat from the Spirit World escapes to capture the spirits of all Kung Fu masters and rule this world by turning them into jade automatons doing his bidding.  Since Po's father is from the secret village of pandas where the secrets of Kung Fu are taught, they travel there, where Poo is to ""learn to be a panda.""  Alas, no one remembers the teachings and it's up to Po to help them regain their knowledge while he, in turn, learns too become the true Dragon Master he's prophesied to be.

Beautiful animation and good voice acting by the original cast with new ones added.  A lot of laughs along the way, also, as the panda penchant for eating...dumplings, noodles, whatever...is exploited and used as a defensive weapon.  Some may complain there's nothing new and the franchise has run its course but it's still a fun movie and a good one to add to your collection, whether or not you have the others in the set.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1472860800,,1249,4.599099099099099

7614961,3,B01AYMA95Y,"The only reason I watched this movie was because, it was in the house and I had the time.  I didn't particularly like 1 and didn't like 2 at all so I had a low bar to hurdle with 3.  Nope, didn't make it.  I will admit that the animation from Dream Works is magnificent and lacked nothing.  Truly colorful, that alone will entice the youngsters.  The problem with this film, as with its predecessors, is that I found very little humor, at least that would tickle the funny bone of a grown up.  Yes, I realize the movie isn't made for an old dude like me but, so many other animated films keep us in mind.

The story as it were, consists of Po the Panda (Jack Black), now the Supreme Dragon or something is called upon to take over training responsibilities from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman).  Hes not interested.  An otherworld refugee named Kai (J. K. Simmons) needs to capture the chi from the earthly worlds population in order to return.  While hes doing that, Po has been reunited with his real father, Li (Bryan Cranston).  Li tells Po he can give him the power to defeat Kai, but must return with him to his village and hundreds of other Pandas.  He must learn to live the life of a Panda.  Pos adoptive father Ping, the goose (James Hong) goes along to look out for his son.

Life as a Panda consists of being lazy.  The the middle section of the movie has Po rolling down hills, sleeping and eating a lot.  Yawn!  Finally things get rolling when Kai comes to take on the remaining folk and absorb their chi.  Outnumbered, Kai does a pretty good job until Po finds his power thanks to his father (the Panda, not the goose).  In the end, I felt sorry for Kai, the water buffalo.  He just wanted to come back to Earth as a regular animal.  But he was beat up by all the Panda power.  Boo Hoo.  With all the great kid movies that have come out in 2016, this one has no business on anyone over 10 years olds best list.",1472688000,,1923,4.236914600550964

7614969,5,B01AYMA95Y,"This is a series that continues to exceed my expectations, being far better than they have any right to be, especially with a premise like ""Kung-Fu Panda"". But the writing is sharp. The stories keep improving with each subsequent iteration. And the art direction? GORGEOUS. I mean, seriously, absolutely incredible. If I had to describe it, I would say hand painted 3D models. Sometimes, it looks like a painting in motion.

Technically, the bluray is an excellent transfer both in visuals and audio. Lots of fun extras, too.

You won't be disappointed. And if you're already a fan? It's a no-brainer.",1472601600,,601,4.9405940594059405

7615088,5,B01AYMA95Y,My son and I both really enjoyed this movie. It explains Po's past and the reason why he was adopted by the duck. The producers did a great job at making sure the animation was colorful and entertaining. I rented this to watch with my 6 year old son and we rewatched it about four times. My 6 year old did not get bored with the movie at all. He was able to understand what was going on and sat still through the whole movie. Other movies like Box Trolls are so boring that he lost interest in them but not with this movie. I found it easy to pick a favorite character besides the main character. The supporting characters are made to be very interesting and their personalities are very entertaining. I feel this movie is one that even adults could enjoy watching without kids. I know a lot of adults who do not like kids movies but this movie is the exception to the rule. We will be watching this movie again as it is one of those movies you won't become bored with.,1470873600,,969,4.21505376344086

In the film, Po meets his real Panda dad, and he goes with him to a hidden Panda village to try to learn how to master his qi in order to defeat a villain Yak called Kai.

This movie is adorable. I love how sweet the film is, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. The film is much more innocent than the first two films, and it plays out like a Saturday Morning cartoon. It has beautiful visuals, great fight scenes, and great writing. Also, the villain Kai is likable, funny, and VERY cool.

Po, his Panda dad, and Kai are all chubby, adorable, and awesome. I also really love the fact that Guillermo Del Toro was involved with this movie.

This movie is terrific, and I definitely recommend it to anyone.",1470441600,,915,4.428571428571429

In true villainous form, the bad guy tracks Poe to this village where he intends to slaughter him and everyone with him.

7615225,4,B01AYMA95Y,"The first two movies were great, however there is something lacking in this third installment.  They added way too many plot lines, and should have left out the panda dad entirely.  (Besides, the duck dad is funnier and more interesting)  The bull was not enough of a threat, or maybe they just spent too much time dwelling on the panda village to make the bull interesting enough.  Animators are spending so much time trying to solve ""what makes the world go around"" and not paying enough attention to the main plot. Example:  The panda is a teacher, then he learns his biological dad is alive, then he travels to meet all of his relatives, then goes to the spirit world....and then.  Everything came way too quick and way too easy.  We knew he was going to find the village and knew he was going to beat the bull.  Why not give us some unexpected plot lines.  Animators tell children in the end all is well and good wins out over evil.  In the real world this is not always the case.  I am not saying make a doom and gloom animation movie...just make one that is believable.  I would have enjoyed the movie if they all went to the spirit world and stayed there through the entire movie.  They could have made the spirit world better looking and with strange looking characters that would challenge them till the end, or they could have spent the entire movie on the panda traveling to the panda village with his father and meeting perils along the way with the bull trying to follow in the snow.  That would have made a more in depth storyline for both children and adults.",1469836800,2,1575,4.442508710801394

7615278,4,B01AYMA95Y,"These films have distinguished themselves by being openly silly, joyful, and full of heart. I admire the way the writers and creators and actors can produce truly dramatic, touching, and memorable moments and then undermine them a few seconds later, but always with good humor and good fun. The broad humor is thankfully not allowed to run fully wild, but is kept in check. The drama is likewise not maudlin or forced, but genuine and at times truly heartbreaking. That gives this series of films more weight than just some kid-fancy-of-the-moment eye-candy that might be assumed by the cover and the title. For those who have ventured this far, we're familiar with the story, and the characters, and have been eagerly awaiting the fulfillment of the teaser from the end of the second film. Po's father is alive and there are other pandas out there, and now we find out what that means for Po. The plot of this movie follows the same arc as the previous films; Po discovers something new about himself, there is a deadly threat to him and his friends, he's the only one who can stop it, etc. It doesn't feel quite as fresh this time, with the film having to go bigger and deeper and grander, but it's still a solid story with excellent performances and touching moments, though some of them feel a little more forced and not quite as genuine as in the previous films. But needless to say this will satisfy all the little panda warriors out there, and most of the bigger ones, too.",1469491200,2,1480,4.609848484848484

However, one thing that the Fu Series has been good at has been that you do not /have to/ see the previous ones to understand the gist. They do a great job in filling you in without bashing your skull in with the previous movies and doing a gross re-hash of details. I would recommend seeing the other two just to watch the path of Po learning and growing into a Kung Fu master in his slap-stick manner. I recommend that kids and adults alike see this series, and 3 is the best addition so far.",1469404800,,548,4.121495327102804

Wonderfully animated with fantastic music to go with it.  The movie is immersive and you will feel very much like you have been teleported to another place and time.  This trilogy capper is less dark than the predecessors but still tickles many emotional buttons.  Showcases true heroism and that each and every one of us has the ability within us to be great.  I true appeal of the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise is highlighted in this 3rd edition and that is the enormous affection we feel for Po, that seemingly bumbling good guy who rises to the occasion.  If you enjoyed the others, you'll love this as well.",1468800000,,861,4.538961038961039

7615515,5,B01AYMA95Y,"I surprised my 4 special needs children with movie night.  Did I mention that this was movie night at home?  Way less expensive then the theaters now a days.  They loved seeing Kung Fu Panda in the theaters but with 4 special needs children sometimes the theaters is not a good idea. Kung Fu Panda 3 was terrific.  Po was hysterical.  2 of my children were saying they look alike, really?  You both are looking for the same thing. (Don't want to give it away) Anyway they still laughed when minutes later Po figured it out.  The action scenes were great especially  the slow motion ones that they do with the karate.  My children were enthralled with the slow motion.  This is huge as they generally don't pay attention to the little things.  The moral shown was that if we are stick together even when only one is in trouble, then we are stronger united.  One person may not be able to accomplish the task but united, well that is a different story.  Also that self esteem, believing in oneself really does make a difference.  The rolling instead of walking because that is what pandas do, again my children were belly laughing.  We of course had to let them know that was pandas not people. :) They loved the movie and will be watching it over and over.  We love the morals taught through fun and action. We absolutely recommend this movie for anyone who wants to sit back and relax away from the cares of this world.",1468627200,3,1419,4.441860465116279

My son however did seem to enjoy this movie, but not so much he asked to see it twice, which is what he usually does with a 24 hour movie rental. He likes the humor, especially the tenders part. Over all the message is sweet, and the plot good, but the movie lacked a little excitement. The animation is excellent of course, and Jack Black as the Panda is pretty entertaining. I would say 3 out of five, and would recommend it the little ones that get the humor, and who maybe liked the first two movies in this franchise.",1468540800,,606,4.058333333333334

It's got a central theme that it sticks to pretty closely.  It can get a little redundant for the grown-ups in the audience being beaten over the head with the same message over and over again, but the little ones will really enjoy it.

7615666,4,B01AYMA95Y,"3.5 Stars. Jennifer Yuh went from the animation department of Kung Fu Panda (2008) to the director of Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011). She works alongside Alessandro Carloni , who worked in the animation department of Kung Fu Panda 2, to bring to life the continuing story of the dragon warrior, the dumpling eating panda Po (Jack Black). Pos master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), has task Po with teaching the Furious 5; Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross), and Viper (Lucy Liu). Po fails miserably and while wallowing at home, he meets another panda, Li (Bryan Cranston). Much to Pos foster fathers dismay, Po and Li, realize that they are father and son. Po heads back to the secret Panda village to find out who he really is. Meanwhile in the afterword, the fierce warrior Kai (J.K. Simmons) has been taking the chi of the faded martial arts masters. Once he collected master Oogways (Randall Duk Kim) chi, Kai returns to the real world after 500 years to collect the chi of more masters. Using the collected chi, he can send the martial arts masters out as jade warriors to do his bidding. Kia soon discovers that he must defeat Po and the rest of the pandas, who once possessed chi. Po is tasked with teaching the lazy and freewill culture of pandas how to fight back. He also must discover who he really is, so he can defeat Kai. Like the previous movies this one is filled with action-packed adventure that is fun for the whole family. Relying on the same principles of the first two movies, Po must master something new to defeat a powerful enemy. It hits on similar lessons and themes that he learned in the previous movies, but the movie continues to shape Po into a martial arts master.  Because of this the major storyline of Po meeting his father and the other pandas fails to amaze the way that it should. In Kung Fu Panda, Po learned that he was the last panda. In Kung Fu Panda 2, Po learned that the rest of the pandas were killed off, until a spoiler at the very end. Po has always longed to know where he came from, and the meeting of his father and the other pandas was less than dramatic. That said movie once again is visual feast and with the same formula of the previous movies it definitely works. If you're a fan of the previous movie, check this one out too.",1468454400,4,2324,4.481132075471698

7615697,5,B01AYMA95Y,"Hello, my name is Taylor and I was selected by product testing USA to do a review on the movie Kung Fu Panda 3. On July 5th I had seen a post on Facebook that product testing USA had posted for a !movie review, so I filled the page out for it on their website and sure enough the next day o received an email saying that I had won! The movie came a week later from the day I won, on July 12th. It came in a manila package. No damage was done to the movie. Although I had thought it may come sooner, being that we have an Amazon just an hour away that my husband works at. Nevertheless though, it came in just as good of shape from a different facility.
Now a little more about the movie. Kung Fu Panda 3 is rated PG because of some mild humor. I received the DVD version of the movie, which also says ""awesome edition"" because of all the extras that it has. Some of the extras include, two all new Kung Fu Panda animated shorts, karaoke with Po, make a paper Panda pal, the origin of skadoosh, and so much more!
A few of the actors/actresses I recognized on this movie were Jack Black, who plays Po, Bryan Cranston, Po's dad, Angelina Jolie, tigress, and even Jackie Chan playing the monkey! So it has some great actors/actresses.
Now to the actual movie itself. I watched this movie with my husband and my son, who is five. We all enjoyed it! In the beginning of the movie a lot happens. A supernatural villian, named Kai shows up after gaining the chi of all the past masters that were in the spirit realm. He wants to absorb all the chi, so starts searching for Po to take his. In the meantime, Po is just meeting his real father, who tells him there is a secret land of pandas that can teach him the chi. While being honest about the secret place of pandas, his dad lies about teaching him chi because they didn't remember how to do it. So Po decides that he doesn't have long before Kai finds them. He tries to train the others in Kung Fu as Kai shows up. Kai turns out to be too strong for the others so Po decides to take him back to the spirit realm alone. There Po regains himself and gains the power of chi, turning him into the ultimate dragon warrior he was always meant to be. Po defeats Kai, and everyone returns to where they belong. He returns home as well, finally succeeding his own master of Kung Fu and becomes the teacher to all his new Panda family and friends. Who all know how to find their chi.
All in all, it was a good movie. My husband and son both enjoyed it as well as I. I honestly think I wouldn't have bought this, being that i really haven't sat and watched the other two of the Kung Fu Panda movies. However, it turned out to be a great movie. I would recommend seeing this movie, especially if you have seen the others.
Finally, I would like to say thank you again to product testing USA for giving me the opportunity to test and review this movie for absolutely no cost to me! It was well worth the five minutes I spent filling out the form. Thank you!",1468454400,,2989,4.13745704467354

7615703,2,B01AYMA95Y,"Whats it about?

Po discovers not only his long-lost father but an entire village of pandas. In karmic payback, he has to train the lazy and clumsy brethren for an upcoming battle.

What did I think?

Full of frenetic energy and color, the third Kung Fu Panda installment won't disappoint the younger audience but adults will struggle with the fact that weve seen it all before. With no real character development since the first movie, KF3 is just the same characters doing the same things in a different setting with new action figures I mean friends. Nothing inherently wrong but just feels a bit tired. Kids will love it ,though: Kung Fu Panda  now with more pandas!",1468281600,,670,4.700854700854701

7615818,4,B01AYMA95Y,"When the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" was released, I was initially skeptical.  Both the titles and the trailers made it seem like the movie was going to be just another goofy animal-based comedy meant for little kids. But thanks to word of mouth, I was convinced to give the film a chance, and was thoroughly surprised at the mature themes lurking just below the surface, and was blown away at the gorgeous animation. The sequel proved to be even better than its predecessor, exploring the origin of Po the panda, and his shockingly tragic backstory. So when a third movie was produced, I eagerly dove in, wondering how and if they could top the previous two entries.

While I still consider the second film to be the best of the trilogy, this new movie manages to complete Po's journey with the same level of humor and heart, with some of the most gorgeous visuals you'll see in an animated movie.

Picking up not long after the events of the previous film, Po continues to defend villages and save people alongside the Furious Five; a task that becomes more complicated when Master Shifu retires and elects Po to become the new teacher at the Jade Temple. But Po's disastrous first day on the job makes him question who or what he really is. His uncertainty is soon answered by the sudden arrival of his biological father, who takes him to a secret village where all the pandas have retreated to. There, Po hopes to master the secrets of channeling the power of chi--something he'll need to do in order to defeat Kai--an old foe that re-emerges from the depths of the spirit realm to steal everyone's chi (or life energy) and make himself the ultimate warrior. Can Po defeat this new enemy and discover who he truly is on the inside?

It's been a treat getting to know all these characters and watch them learn and grow, both as fighters and as people. And although the Furious Five kind of takes a back seat this time around, it's great that the producers were able to keep all the same voice actors. This time, it's Po's adoptive father Mr. Ping who gets a bit more to do, as he butts heads with Po's real father, Li Shan, over what's the best thing to do for the son they now have to share.  Both have their individual ways of caring for their kids, but both are united in their love for Po, and will do anything to protect him. As for Po, he, of course, sees the most development, going from bumbling-but-well meaning student, to a kung fu master who embodies the concept of yin-yang:  a teacher who can bring out the fullest potential in anyone by helping them adopt a fighting style that compliments their own personal talents. Such themes of finding balance, discovering who you are, believing in yourself, and staying true to yourself all come full circle, and it makes the viewer proud of how far Po's come in his journey.

As for the technical side of things, all the fight scenes are well choreographed, with fast and fluid animation, and utterly beautiful locations and visuals (both 3D AND 2D)--some of which blur the line between cartoon and real life photography. It really makes me want to take a trip to China and see all these similar locations for myself.

Simply put, if you liked the first two movies, then you'll also enjoy this final installment, which wraps up the story nicely and makes me happy that I gave this series a chance. Here's to hoping we can all someday unlock our inner chi and become the best person we can be.",1467590400,,3448,4.532154340836013

7615856,5,B01AYMA95Y,"I've watched this film twice, so far, and intend to watch it innumerable times in the future.

The villain in this sequel is more powerful than any of Po's previous antagonists; he's a bull with dread locks from the spirit world.  SPOILER ALERT:  The villain captures all the Kung Fu Masters in China and the spirit world except Po and Tigress, and threatens to capture all the pandas, including Po. Po's secret move doesn't work on opponents from the spirit world, so he uses a trick to take his opponent back to the spirit world, and his fellow pandas and other friends who remain in the real world use their chi to save him from the villain.

The Dream Works animators went crazy with the panda animations in this film.  Not only did they create Po's biological father (and thus an asexual love triangle as his goose father becomes jealous of his panda father), but a whole village full of pandas of all sorts of pandas, young and old, male and female!  If you love pandas, Dream Works' animated versions of pandas, then this sequel may be your favorite!",1467504000,3,1057,4.5661375661375665

This made me feel the entire rainbow of emotions from insanely elated to completely despondent. As a Giant Panda myself, I can identify with Po's struggle to belong and find his own kind. I think more bamboo-munching would have been much more pleasing to my species, but until there is a panda-produced CGI movie I can't really complain too much, Jack Black's soothing Bob Ross-esque voice calms the soul and massages the ear holes.

7615957,1,B01AYMA95Y,"Horrible movie. No solid plot at a third of the way through the movie and I had to turn it off. I'm not from eastern Asia and have no upbringing or interest in eastern mysticism, which is a huge factor in this movie. Kids' movies seem to have alot of magic to completely prop up the storyline; granted- talking pandas and other animals are far-fetched but they have always been a standard in kid's shows. I get that, but this movie, like many others goes way off the deep end.",1466553600,2,476,4.3

7615985,4,B01AYMA95Y,"Kung fu panda 1&2 were fantastic, and I had been really disappointed to miss the third one in theaters.  Sadly, the third one comes of as silly and formulaic by comparison.  The signature touches of the series (e.g., stylized animation flashbacks) had less life in them than before, and although it's hard to complain about the design, it felt as though the animators were scratching their heads a bit trying to figure out what to do after the second movie.  That said, it's still beautiful to look at and the action is inventive and compelling.  A let down, but still enjoyable.",1466121600,,579,4.702970297029703

He should not be white it should be outlawed. or at lest he can change his name to something hebrew so we know who he is (that he's safe). Next they have these weird bears""pandas"" that are segregated, on their fur.  The black and white are separate instead of mergd into gray and I cannot stand for that. Racist movie overall and I wil not watch a white man. I thought Jck Black was african american until I saw him then I though he was white.

7616152,4,B01AYMA95Y,"I'm always shocked, bewildered - a little lost at sea - after watching DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda films.

I come expecting empty-headed, childish prattle. After all, these are monstrously budgeted $130 million-plus tent pole productions aimed at the biggest, broadest global mass audience imaginable. Those kinds of films usually can't afford to be anything but loud, flashy vehicles for bland content.

Yet, I leave the theater in awe - of the films' sheer beauty, their pure, unspoiled heart, and their openness to engage with young viewers without patronizing them or treating them as mere consumers.

It happened again Wednesday night at a screening of Kung Fu Panda 3, a 3D American-Chinese production that takes franchise hero Po (voiced by Jack Black) on an epic existential journey that reunites him with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston) and reconnects him through his dad with his inner pandahood.

A gorgeous visual treat, the film doesn't fetishize its 3D effects, but uses them in service to story and characters.

And such characters! We've already grown to love them from the first two films: There's the lovely and deadly Tigress (Angelina Jolie), the wise Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), flirtatious dancer Mei Mei (Kate Hudson), friendly slitherer Viper (Lucy Liu), and playful Monkey (Jackie Chan).

The story opens with a deadly battle in the spirit realm between Master Shifu and Kai (J.K. Simmons), a power-hungry bull who has defeated dozens of martial arts masters. Instead of killing them, he steals their chi, or life-force, using it to make himself stronger.

Master Shifu loses, setting the stage for Po to take up the fight and save the world.

But the Kung Fu Panda films aren't really about punches and kicks. They're about facing up to your fears and discovering your inner strength.

Kung Fu Panda 3 is especially insightful because it shows that inner battles aren't resolved by gazing at your navel, but by connecting to others. Po, who has always believed he was the last panda, learns this when he discovers a whole village of pandas.

It's easy to mistake the simplicity of plot and theme here for simple mindedness - this isn't Pynchon or Proust. Kung Fu Panda 3 has the economy of a Zen koan, not to mention its inner harmony and wisdom.",1464912000,,2290,5.002631578947368

However as you read too many comments, its clearly from those people not in the age bracket for this and many other G and PG rated cartoons. This is not Anime people and please if you didn't enjoy it then fine, but if you are not in elementary school then hey it wasn't meant for you nor was the first or second installment. This was a fitting edition to conclude Pos journey of becoming not just the Dragon Warrior, but ultimately finding his true self and where he belonged. When my childs Kindergarten class went , not only did NOT ONE child needed a Time-Out or a potty break, they all sat at the edge of their little seats feet kicking away until the very end when they all jumped and yelled yah! Can we see it again. That people is who this movie is for, KIDS and the KIDs at heart who just want a Fun movie to watch, not exploit plot holes, no couch potato directing just enjoyment of what's given.

7616193,5,B01AYMA95Y,"I greatly enjoyed the first two ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies -- the first was a lighthearted romp that, at the same time, carried a valuable message and served as a homage of sorts to old-fashioned kung fu movies; the second continued that tradition, but also wasn't afraid to shy away from giving the titular panda a dramatic backstory and fleshing out the world of the series.  Said second movie, however, also ended on the mother of all sequel hooks, and it instantly made me wary.  It's a rare franchise that's able to keep up its quality for a third movie, and while it can be done (the ""Toy Story"" franchise and, to some degree, the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, managed this), it happens seldom enough that I went into ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" with some trepidation and rather low expectations.

I needn't have worried.  ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" continues the tradition of blending goofy slapstick with exciting action and moments of genuine drama and emotion.  And it's a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

Po, the clumsy and wise-cracking panda who somehow became China's Dragon Warrior, is confident in his abilities as a warrior... but finds himself completely out of his depth when Master Shifu assigns him to be a teacher.  But before his ""teaching"" can completely destroy the Jade Palace and his Furious Five teammates, a visitor comes to the valley... the panda Li Shang, who reveals that he's Po's true father.  In an effort to discover who he really is -- and to discover the secret of chi, the life energy that pandas have supposedly mastered -- Po travels with his father to the hidden panda village, where he learns the arts of napping, rolling, big eating, and other arts.  Before he can get around to mastering chi, however, a threat returns to menace all of China -- Kai, a warlord from the spirit realm who seeks to absorb the chi of every kung fu master and resume his reign of terror.  China needs a hero... but what they get is Po and his roly-poly kinsfolk.  Can a village of untrained pandas stop a vicious warlord bent on destroying every hero in China?

The animation in this film is phenomenal.  Dreamworks has come a long way in its 3D animation, and the lush backgrounds and fantastic effects for this film are proof of that.  Up-close shots of Po and his father astound me, as the fur textures look amazing enough to reach out and pet.  Special effects such as the chi powers are well-done as well, and the backgrounds and scenery are amazingly rendered and detailed.

The voicework for this film is well-done as well.  Jack Black continues to provide us with a comedic hero that you can still love and feel sorry for, giving Po more depth and emotion than one would expect from a hero that's primarily meant to be funny.  The returning big-name cast (Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, David Cross, and James Hong) have really grown into their roles, and it's great to see them returning to continue their roles in the film series.  Newcomers Bryan Cranston, J. K. Simmons, and Kate Hudson fit well in their respective roles as well.  (Rebel Wilson was credited as appearing in this film in the trailers, but sadly had to back out -- it's quite obvious which character she was supposed to represent, however -- Mei-Mei is just sassy enough to fit her.)

""Kung Fu Panda 3"" also has plenty of callbacks to the previous films, and not only fleshes out the backstories of several characters (especially Master Oogway, the tortoise kung fu master of the first movie), but adds depth to the world and characters of the series.  In places the film does feel a little ""World of Warcraft""-ish, especially in the panda village (which feels like something out of ""Mists of Pandera"") and in the aesthetics of the villain Kai.  But that's not a flaw, I think -- if anything, I feel that means this film has managed to achieve something epic, and become more than a kid's film, but also an epic adventure film.

A splendid conclusion to the series, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a film both kids and adults will enjoy, and is just as good as the previous two films.  I feel it's a fine note to end the series on, and just hope DreamWorks doesn't milk the franchise dry...",1464652800,,4200,4.620457604306864

The bottom line is that sight gags were substituted for substance.  Much of the soul and charm that made the first two movies so endearing was gone.  It's like the characters existed mainly for jokes and gags.

Spoiler alert...

The villain was contrived and came out of nowhere (OK, the ""spirit realm"" which is much like our realm only with floating rocks instead of land), and the solution was superpowers that came out of nowhere when Po realized who he really was.  So the lesson is: figure out who you are and you get super powers with no work.

It's fine for an evening's entertainment, but I don't care if I never see it again.  And if I never care to see it again, it makes no sense to own it.",1460851200,3,849,4.25

7616291,4,B01AYMA95Y,"Po, our beloved Panda is back with his antics and underdog heroism in his latest adventure in Kung Fu Panda 3. I have to admit, I have been an avid fan of the Kung Fu Panda franchise movies and dedicatedly watched and re-watched each movie, enjoying it every time and am so happy to say that the third installment is again an entertainer.

In this movie, Po is challenged by Kai, a Yak warrior from the spirit world who has come back to our  world to rule and the only obstacle in his path is Po, the Dragon Warrior. While strong, Po is no match against Kai's strength and will have to train himself and evoke new hidden powers inside him to battle this new villain.

We meet Po's long lost father in this movie and while the movie could have been serious, the makers have succeeded in making this one a funny, entertaining, sometimes emotional, sometimes adorably cute and totally action packed.

The movie is not your usual serious superhero flick but made with children in mind so it's never very serious and any somber mood is instantly lightened with a comic event or a cute antic from the characters who are all so memorable that I had them in my mind long after watching the movie.

The narrative is strong, the plot well executed and the voices rendered to the characters flawless. Dreamworks have employed their very impressive skills in bringing to us spellbindingly realistic imagery and effects that are memorable and whether you are kid or an adult, you are sure to fall in love with the images. This movie has some impressive 3D effects so I would suggest that you watch it in 3D to get the full impact.

All in all, Kung Fu Panda 3 is full of entertainment, fun and promises a time well spent. Suited to both kids and adults, this one is a slightly goofy, sometimes emotional and other times inspiring but always entertaining story of Po, the beloved fat Panda who became the Dragon Warrior but still cant climb steps without panting! 4 out of 5 to it from me. Go watch and enjoy this movie with your family.

7616292,5,B01AYMA95Y,"In the third installment of the popular family film series Kung Fu Panda, you will find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster, with just enough action, comedy and love to go around.

Large and adorable panda Po (Jack Black) realizes he has a lot to learn if he wants to surpass his next obstacle from his role-model instructor. During this long, adventurous process, he finds himself reunited with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston). Po must find a way to morph into the teacher he was always destined to be. With help from his new panda family, the martial-arts masters come together to fight the envious and malevolent Kai (J.K. Simmons), a warrior who came back from the spirit realm, in order to steal everyones chi.

I have always been a kid at heart but watching this film truly made me feel like it was my first time ever watching Kung Fu Panda in the movie theater. Since it brought back a ton of memories, I couldn't help but notice all of the fantastic, quality changes the film has gone through. This has always been a great series from the start, but this movie takes the gold when it comes down to storyline and visual effects. There is no doubt in my mind that the creative directors and graphic designers behind this film spent tons and tons of hours developing such amazing oriental scenes within this movie. Every single color, movement, saying or setting in this film truly embodies what Kung Fu Pand is all about, which makes the meaning and experience for an avid movie-goer all the more understanding and worthwhile. Because of the sincere storyline, it will hit home to lots of viewers and family members. One thing I do wish I had the opportunity to see more of are the famous and Furious Five (voiced by Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, David Cross, and Seth Rogen) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman)  in action altogether, especially when attempting to defeat the evil Kai.

Ultimately, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a hilarious and charming film for everyone in the family to enjoy. Whether its moving you to tears from laughter or gloominess, youll find it hard not to smile with satisfaction when the credits begin rolling. This movie is rated PG for its martial arts action and some mild rude humor, so I think this will be just perfect for kids ages 5 to 18. I rate this film 4.5 out of 5 five stars.

7616295,2,B01AYMA95Y,"If you're a fan of the first two Kung Fu Panda movies, you'll probably have to see this one as well.  Just be ready for a lackluster story that will leaving you wondering if the franchise has lost its direction.

You'll get to see your favorite characters and there are a couple little jokes that are worth a chuckle, but sadly the comedy aspect of the film is also lacking vastly.  It seems like they wanted to add another movie to the franchise but didn't have a good, solid direction to take it in.  Rather than put the bad ideas out, the chose one of them and moved forward.  The end result was unsatisfying at the very least.

I feel most people will find this film to be of average quality but going into it with low expectations will help you enjoy the experience a bit more.

I watched this film in the theater and as such this review does not pertain whatsoever to any features specific to the disc release versions of the film.",1458518400,7,937,4.32

So unnecessary, and so wrong for kids to see, especially when it's everywhere else.  I bought the first two movies, but won't be getting this one!",1458172800,10,295,4.528301886792453
7616297,5,B01AYMA95Y,"DreamWorks presents the third in the series of Kung Fu Panda  The weight is over and it is truly a sight to see. It is bold on the big screen with its trademark nonstop movement. We felt as if the film flew by in a matter of minutes with all that was happening around us along with the unending laughter from everyone around us which included all of us too; it actually brought tears to my eyes in places as it is as funny as it is meaningful and warm in places.

The music, by Hans Zimmer, is never-ending and enthralling with pieces of tunes that you will recognize and be happy about. While constant motion is happening right in front of you, this was impossible to look away from  at least for me. As the movie begins, Po exclaims Justice is about to be served because of Kai - The beast of vengeance (J.K. Simmons) has come onto the scene to do mighty battle with their village. This sends all of the characters (so many vocal performances to list individually!) into frenzied motion but they know that they can count on Po, a now warrior Kung Fu Panda, learning to be a Master Dragon Warrior himself with a little teaching... hopefully.

Upon the otherworldly Kais exit, Po then jumps into a bubble bath and is seen by his adoptive father who cannot understand the response from him, I come home to find you playing with your dolls? Po then shouts loudly, Action Figures. The reason I mention this is because I have heard this response over and over myself and found it interesting with boys and their ""action figures"", Not Dolls""... Oops, from me! This is the point with these wonderful dialogs of DreamWorks pictures; they are just as entertaining for adults to watch along with their children which are a definite bonus. This particular film is chock full of one-liners that come at you quick from especially Po - (Jack Black) - who is known for this in any film he does and I always appreciate a movie that can entertain any age group being all together.

An older Panda named Li comes to say many years ago he lost his son and Po returns the sentiment. They quickly find each other again exclaiming that Its like looking in a fat mirror with their likenesses and he soon learns that the Universe says there is a whole Panda Village where he belongs. He meets his relatives, learns what it means to have a Panda family, and really learns how Pandas live Not like he once did, but he adapts as this is a happy and uplifting movie. As I said, the film is in constant motion along with dialog and sound from the very beginning until the end. It grabs your attention with Kai and Po, then your heart and never lets loose. And, yes, there was a warm and happy feeling once at the end of Kung Fu Panda 3. This film is Recommended for the Family or anyone who wants to experience - once again - a good time",1457740800,14,2809,4.363288718929255

This is a great finale to the series and a film that parents neednt dread taking their children to.  (Sweet Jesus, I do not want to see the Angry Birds movie.  Thank God I managed to dodge The Road Chip.)  The beautiful animation even incorporates some old school 2D cartoon elements.  The voice talent is top-notch as all of the old cast returns.  Veteran character actor James Hong gets a lot to do in this installment and deserves special mention for voicing Mr. Ping, the crane who adopted Po, in such an appealing manner.  The Kung Fu Panda trilogy deserves to endure as a childrens classic.",1456617600,,801,4.719424460431655
7616304,5,B01AYMA95Y,"I have to admit I went into this somewhat reluctantly.  It was family movie night with my four year-old and this was the only viable option.  I had seen the first two and liked them, but just wasn't really in the mood for an animated kids' movie, but my wife and son talked me into seeing it with them in 3D.  Good move, because I absolutely loved it, probably more than they did, and was genuinely moved by its heart and wisdom, not to mention the stunning 3D animation.

The storyline follows Po as he continues his journey of self-discovery, trying to understand who he is, how to become a teacher rather than a students, and fulfill his destiny as the Dragon Warrior.  All of this becomes very complicated when his long-lost biological father enters the picture and all of his friends and mentors are vanquished by the vengeful supernatural villain Kai, who absorbs their spirit energy to make himself more powerful.  To stand up to him, Po must face all of his fears and insecurities and discover the secrets of harnessing his chi.  Obviously, there are a lot of references to Eastern mysticism and spirituality, but I felt they were handled very well and without being dogmatic or offensive to people who do not share those beliefs.

As far as visuals go, the animation here was top notch and I have a hard time remembering a movie that made such good use of 3D.  The colors were magnificent and there was such depth to every little detail that it's hard to imagine Dreamworks improving on the level of the animation here... just amazing.

Another strong point is the vocal performances.  The level of talent lending their voices here is very impressive:  Jack Black, Bryan Cranston as Po's long-lost father, J.K. Simmons as the evil Kai, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Kate Hudson, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, David Cross, the list just goes on and on and they are all excellent here.  the jokes are funny, the writing is sharp, and most of all, the comedic timing is right on.

I left the theater in a great mood, genuinely moved and impressed by what I had seen.  As a parent of a young child, I've had to sit through so many crass, poorly conceived, badly written kids movies that substitute pratfalls and fart jokes for story and character, so it was so refreshing to see something like this.  It has a strong and uplifting positive message and everyone involved seemed very invested in it and at the top of their game.

In short, I can't recommend it highly enough.",1455753600,97,2485,4.611363636363636
7616305,3,B01AYMA95Y,"While live-action martial arts movies are pretty rare nowadays, at least good or successful ones, Dreamworks has discovered that kids really love kung fu. Or at least they like it animated and when performed by a jolly ol' panda. The first two Kung Fu Panda movies were delightful surprises, with the superior sequel adding something extra by really digging deep into Chinese culture, both narratively and visually. Kung Fu Panda 3 continues that trend, as well as the high level of quality seen by the entire franchise.

Once envisioned as a 6-film series, this third entry feels a lot like a franchise-ender, completing Po's (Jack Black) quest for self-enlightenment, as well as resolving one key mystery about his past. Picking up where the last film left off, Po has learned that he's not the only panda out there in the world, and that his father is actually alive. It isn't long before his biological pop, Li (Bryan Cranston) comes strolling into the village looking for his boy, which naturally upsets Po's noodle-vending adoptive duck, Mr. Ping (James Hong). After bouncing bellies off one another for a while, and causing some playful ruckus in the dojo of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), Li invites his son to the hidden panda village where the rest of his kind live. There he promises, Po will learn to harness his chi into a powerful force.

It's a power Po will need as he's about to face his most dangerous enemy yet, Kai (voiced perfectly by JK Simmons), who has cut a path of destruction through the afterlife. The film has opens with a fantastical, jaw-dropping cosmic battle between him and sage old tortoise Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) that sees them harnessing their chi in amazing displays right out of Dragon Ball Z. It's worth noting the 3D is tremendous here, as it is throughout the entire film.

Kai's probably the most one-dimensional villain the franchise has had, but it's made up for by the threat he poses to Po and the people he loves. Capturing the ""souls"" of everyone he defeats and passing through into the real world, Kai scoffs at the idea of losing to the Dragon Master Po, and threatens to destroy not only him, but the entire panda village. There isn't a lot of meat on those bones, so much of the story's focus is on Po as he reconnects with his father and the panda lineage he never knew. In the village he finds that panda life is even more relaxed than he already is, and that his father still harbors secrets that could affect his future. But with Kai looming and already having faced Shifu and the Furious Five, Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), Po must finally learn what it means to be a teacher and not just a student.

Guided by co-directors and longtime 'Panda' collaborators Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni, the film always stays happily light on its feet, even when the circumstances turn dire and beloved characters begin to fall. That said, it would have been nice to see a little more dramatic weight put behind the reunion of Po and his father given how tragic their separation had been. From a technical standpoint these movies are top of the line, and the way they bring real martial arts styles into vivid animated life is truly beautiful. It's clear the amount of research the directors and Dreamworks put in to channel the many Asian influences, with the panda village a colorful interpretation of Chengdu.

Kung Fu Panda 3 doesn't quite raise the bar but that's only because the first two films set such an incredibly high standard.  It's still likely to end up one of the year's best animated features no matter what Pixar may put out, and hopefully this doesn't spell the end of Po's great adventures. There's always a new lesson to be learned and a new foe for the Dragon Master to fight.",1455667200,8,3845,4.714285714285714

7616308,3,B01AYMA95Y,"I LOVED the first two Kung Fu Panda movies. They were funny, had heart and even had some really dark moments with intense action scenes. But Kung Fu Panda 3 seems to completely erase the action, darkness and just left humor and heart.

And what you get, is a VERY weak kiddy movie. It's great for kids, but if you're an adult Kung Fu Panda fan like me, then its very weak. and theres lots of adult fans for this.

The only thing I can say I enjoyed was the fact we see Po's father, but other than the the plot is very weak, kiddy-like and not near as dark or even just cool as the previous two films.

I'm not sure if parents complained that the second was too dark or what, but wow what a downgrade. Even the DVD cover is kiddyish. We just see Po and a baby panda. It honestly looks like Brother Bear. No cool Kung fu poses, nothing.

The first two films were awesome. They made a perfect blend of humor, heart, darkness and action for both kids and adults to enjoy.

But with Kung fu Panda 3...idk, it just felt so much weaker and underwhelming. The first two had GREAT villains and awesome writing.

But..the villain in this is just...boring. He's not intimidating and his character is not that interesting. I remember being actually intimidated and amazed by how strong, evil and badass Tai Lung was.

And Shen, from the second film. His design and voice was so...threatening. And it made it work, it made a GREAT threatening villain.

But this villain...sighs, its the same thing we've seen. I've seen a bull with horns villain so much its becoming annoying. In Narnia, in My Little Pony, etc. The villain just is not scary or threatening.

Even the background characters aren't scared of him. Another thing I didn't like was how they did Po. At least in the other two films, even though he made jokes, he still knew when to get serious.

In this film, he just makes jokes through the whole thing. He rarely gets serious, and it just really downgrades his character. Also, what was the point of the 'love interest'?

She only appeared twice in the whole movie, she's very unlikable and is more like a creepy stalker rather than someone who actually loves Po. What was her point? She did this ribbon dance, freaked Po out, and then never showed up again. Only briefly during the battle. But BRIEFLY.

I don't hate the film, Its just REALLY disappointing when you compare it to the first two. Its great for little kids, but if you're an adult fan, you might feel the same.",1455062400,2,2475,4.439293598233996

This is a really fun movie to watch, and I didn't think it would happen for the third time, but the animation just keeps getting better.  Great colors, epic scenes and fantastic music that hits the mood of this movie.  It's not perfect, some cliches, but which film doesn't?  The pro's far outweigh any cons.",1454716800,,462,4.4
7616311,3,B01AYMA95Y,"The Premise:

Following the events of the first two movies, Po and his friends live a largely peaceful life protecting the Valley of Peace. The greatest challenge that faces Po is the sudden call to become the master of their dojo training his fellow warriors in the arts of Kung Fu, which he is lousy at.

However, before this line can be followed too far, he is surprised by the sudden return of his biological father. He doesnt have too long to digest this turn of events, however, before the real trouble reveals itself. For unbeknownst to them, a figure from long ago, formerly trapped in the spirit world, seeks revenge on Master Oogway by destroying everything he had built, and that means them, and the life they have been leading in their valley.

The Short of It:

""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a fun, lighthearted conclusion to the Kung Fu Panda trilogy. The movie benefits from exciting action, great design and music, and a well characterized villain. All the same, some of the sheen has worn thin, and the heart of the first two films has faded somewhat. Furthermore, structural problems hurt the dramatic satisfaction of the end of the story, and Po doesn't seem to gain any real character growth aside from a serious power level-up. None of these things will hurt most kids' experience, but for adults in the audience the silliness won't have the deeper level to cover for it and it will be all the more grating. Despite that, they will probably have a decent time anyway. It's a good film that, while shallow, will provide a fun time for families and fans.

First though he learns his father ""voiced by the great Bryan Cranston"" is alive and the two bond in some hilarious scenes. In order to defeat a new villain; Po must learn a new move called that only pandas can teach him.
  While I found the movie funny and touching. I did find that Po not complaining too much during a long journey to the hidden Panda village was out of character. Shifu suddenly wanting to hand over his teaching duties to Po was out of character for him as well.
  My biggest problem though is that the Panda village is supposed to be so well hidden. Yet when anyone wants to find Po in the movie they easily make their way to the village.
  With so many 3rd movies being disappointing duds though I didn't find it hard to look passed the problems. Since the movie is highly enjoyable and likeable. A 4th film isn't really necessary though since the movie has a fitting and satisfying conclusion.",1454457600,,990,4.406593406593407
