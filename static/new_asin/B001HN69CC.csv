3631433,5,B001HN69CC,"I was not sure how this movie would be.  My mom and I see movies sometimes.  She told me this one looked good.  So, me, her and my step sister went to see it.  The movie is about a man.  The man can travel in time.  Though he cannot control when or where he goes.  He will just disappear, and appear in a different place and time.  Did I mention he loses his clothes when he does this?  He has to find a place to get some fast.  One day he travels somewhere and a girl says his name.  As if she knows him.  The man though does not know the girl.  He may have met her when he is older, and she much younger.  She always wants to get married to him.  Maybe it will happen.  Eventually, the man marries someone.  I will not say who.  They try to have a baby.  The lady keeps having miscarriages.  Turns out that the baby may be time traveling as a fetus!  If that makes the movie sound stupid, don't worry.  They don't go crazy with it.  That may not even be what's wrong.  It may be the stress of the mother.  She does all she can to relax and eventually has a baby.  But can the baby grow up to time travel as well?  I guess only time will tell.  Then, one day, the dad sees himself.  Something is wrong though.  He seems to be hurt.  Then he travels away.  The mom and dad try to think if the man is going to die.  If you knew when you were going to die, would you feel relived, or afraid?

The movie was great.  It had humor, romance, drama  and sci-fi.  He gets really deep in the middle.  When the father talks to someone who may be important to him.  They told a little about how they may could travel in time.  But they didn't really explain that much.  You still get the feeling that you understand enough to understand the movie.  Also, you kind of wonder, If something were to happen to the man, would another version of himself be able to travel to the time when he was gone, and live his life then?  Sound confusing?  Well, don't worry.  It really wasn't.  This was such a good movie to see on a warm day.  All the actors do a great job.  You really get into it.  They could probably make another movie about this.  I won't say why.  I even think they could have a TV show about it.  Guess I am thinking Quantum leap.  But what if they had a show where they tried to find out how to stop it?  Guess the last thing we all need is another TV show that isn't very good, based on a great movie.  I would say if you like sci - fi or romance movies, than you will probably like this one.  We say it at 2 and almost every seat was taken.",1250208000,5,2540,3.950199203187251

3631525,5,B001HN69CC,"I love to read. I devour books in days, sometimes hours, especially novels, romance, thrillers, mysteries, etc. I received this book from my husband as a gift which is the only reason I finished it though it took me 3 months. I could not get into this book as I was so confused trying to keep the time line straight with one dimensional characters. I did not come to understand much less like the characters, felt I could not relate to them and really felt kept at arms length the entire time. I did not find it elegant, moving or romantic and struggled the whole way through. Honestly I hated the book for its lack of character development and over complicated story structure. The story itself could have been an easier read and the characters could have been better developed to make them more real and allow the reader to care about them.

I begrudgingly watched the movie and found that I loved it, totally related and cared about Henry, Clare, Alba and cast and it even made me cry. I won't spoil it but I will say that the movie cut and edited parts from the book and made this a great story! This is a case where the movie trumps the book.",1522454400,,1147,4.359813084112149

3631537,5,B001HN69CC,"Ive watched this numerous times. A love story that spans a lifetime. The negative reviews all compare it to the novel (does ANY movie ever measure up to that standard?). The acting is authentic, given the subject/plot; the settings, filmography, and dialogue are exquisite. Not an Eric Bana fan, but here, he is good, and Rachel McAdams steals the screen anyway; as do the complimentary characters. Kudos to the writer of the novel: great love story with a twist.",1518220800,,463,4.8734177215189876

3631628,4,B001HN69CC,"I enjoyed the book very much and was looking forward to seeing how it would translate to film. In general the movie was good and fairly faithful to the book, though much was omitted and the sequences were rearranged. But one of the most powerful moments in the book was the ending, which this movie omitted in favor of their own version which was weaker and had less impact. I've seen this happen before and am always insulted by script writers who think they can write better story lines than the original author. There's a reason books become popular and there was no reason to change what was originally there.",1498694400,2,613,4.581818181818182

I've purchased other movies that have multiple movies on one disc, this however only played the Lake House - so it is not user error. There was no menu screen, just auto play of that movie.

3631870,5,B001HN69CC,"Henry (Eric Bana) a research library is greeted by a young lady named Clare (Rachel McAdams.) Clare knows Henry. In fact, she has been in love with him all her life. Therefore, Clare knows Henry. However, Henry does not know Claire. Yet Henry knows the Clare knows him and why.

After we dispense with who knows whom and why, after we dispense with how it is possible or improbable. We get to the point this is an extremely complex and intriguing love story without all this sappiness that distracts from a very good viewing experience.

I have had the good luck or misfortune of watching this movie before reading the book. You can see from the pacing of the movie that there was a terrific effort to adapt and include the highlights and the essence of the book to the point that they are duplicates and not trying to just make a movie with the names and places.

I have only seen the Blu-Ray version. They took great pains to describe how wonderful Blu-Ray is before the movie starts. However, there is an appalling lack of DVD goodies or extras like a voiceover by the actors or directors.

Some movies just deserve top billing without having to dissect it to find out why.",1480809600,,1176,4.507042253521127

I was prepared to be disappointed by the movie, but actually I think they did a very good job getting across the core of the story in a very different medium.

It's a movie that never truly feels like it ends.  There are characters introduced that you think are going to play more of a role like the Dr. or Gomez that end up just being peripheral characters.

Having my entire cognitive map re-written by Mr. Curtis' [genuinely]  brilliant work, I'm merely scared.  For the sake, not only of the author, or the actors, but for the audience:  a large collectivity of consent-engineered rats in a world-wide Skinner Box.

If you've already encountered both the documentary and this movie, you'll know what I mean; if you haven't, then you need to see the former to understand my comments about the latter.

I never could imagine that romance and time travel could mesh at all, but this movie does a decent job of doing so. The things that take away from the movie are parts of the script.

My Frau and I still like to watch it occasionally even though we know the plot thoroughly by now, mostly because the acting is so well done and compelling, and Rachel McAdams is very pretty.  The story takes an impossible (in our current understanding of spacetime) science fiction idea and makes it seem completely natural to the characters -- nothing forced or contrived about it.  If you're a healthy, emotionally sensitive person, you may find that this even brings a tear to your eye.

3632842,4,B001HN69CC,"This is a nicely done film, acted beautifully, photographed with subtle brilliance and edited with a tenderness reserved for bathing an infant. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" was a well regarded novel and brilliantly written. Having read the novel first, the movie was a slight let down; nothing could be placed beside Audrey Niffeneger's novel and come out an equal. The subject of time travel is a well visited topic from H.G. Wells to Stephen King, but it is only Niffeneger who has managed to create a plausible frame of time travel and then have it be the white canvas on which a remarkable story is created.
  The film is by Robert Schwentke, a well respected film maker, and well known. In two hours he tells the story of Henry and Clare. Clare is played by Rachel McAdams, who has prepared this role with an Oscar level proffesionalism. Henry is played by Australian actor (with a flawless American accent) Eric Bana. At age six, Henry survives a car accident that kills his mother. It also triggers a neurological malfunction which causes him to jump time-only within the span of his life- with no warning and no control. He meets and falls in love with Clare. Though because her time is linear and his is not, an already deeply in love Clare sees Henry in a library and overwhelms him with the thrill of finally seeing him. She knows him because he has been visiting her since she was six, helping to guide her, so she is ready and waiting for him. Henry knows things about their future and tries his best to protect Clare, but Henry's life is hard and frustrating, always anxious to get back to her. The editing, make-up and acting through their wedding is remarkable. In that one day we see Henry as young as 23 and as old as 41. When Henry goes, leaving Clare to wait, sometimes for years, his clothing remains behind, losing shape and weeping to the floor. It's a visual that beautifully reflects the let down that Clare feels. Henry appears, naked, at another time, in all kinds of weather, immediately facing the challenges of being an outlaw.
  When they have a child (who has inherited this genetic code but has more control over it) Henry takes her aside and quietly tea hes her to cope- from lock picking to how to learn WHEN she is. No more details are needed except to tell you this is a story about the challenges involved in a relationship. There are both disadvantages and advantages to this malady and they are explored without taking away from the purpose of the film: love.
  Some may call this a ""date movie"" but their eye isn't as good as mine. There are details to this film that put it on a level far above a ""chick flick"" or a ""sci-fi geek"" film, despite having elements of both.
  The film score by Mychael Danna, is glorified in the hands of Nicholas Dodd, who did the orchestrations and conducted. The music is used to maintain a thread of story line when Henry jumps from 1987 to 2002; then musical idony and foreshadowing is clever and abundant. Again, many won't notice the music.
  An autumn pasture is an integral setting and the colors of that set are used through the film, like a painting.
  This is a subtle film and well made so the millions of remarkable details blend together to wash over us and gently lead us along with the story. It works: at no time do we wonder, ""How did they DO that?"" or, ""Great make up cause three seconds ago he had no gray hair and wasbclean shaven"". Nothing is overdone so nothing breaks the spell.
  Is this a remarkable piece of art? No. But we don't always want to see ""The Hours"" or ""Silence of The Lambs"" or ""Sophie's Choice."" Sometimes we want to be able to converse without a lump in the throat or a recurring image of a dry well in a basement. Buy the film. You do need to seek out the details and enjot the discoveries that multiple viewings will bring.",1438905600,6,3835,4.483500717360115

I think the movie had a good start, and had SUCH potential if the storyline hadn't went into deep south mode.  His travels leapt across time - past, present, future - and I never saw that he was of any benefit to any time he found himself.  Why would an author (playwright) even think that there would be any ""purpose"" to travel from a happy moment to another moment where the outcome is running, hiding, fighting, stealing, breaking and entering and arrests only to travel back to the happy moment left behind???  There are a few beautiful moments in the movie, but they are almost lost in the absolute absurdity.  I was clinging to the thought that maybe the author would give everyone their happy ending at the end.

3633144,4,B001HN69CC,"An intriguing love story that attempts to answer the question of what lies beyond our mortal envelope and whether love endures outside the bounds and limits of our physical bodies. McAdams is as fresh and likable as you can possibly imagine as the young woman searching for her 'dream man' from childhood and Eric Bana is very believable as the often lost and confused,  but determined 'time-traveler' who loves her.

Take a chance on this one and see if you can suspend your cynicism about romance long enough to enjoy this refreshing take on romance",1421193600,,551,4.7894736842105265

3633194,3,B001HN69CC,"While being somewhat poignant and touching, THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a largely contrived affair that telegraphs the emotional beats from miles away, robbing it of a great deal of the impact it otherwise could have had. Eric Bana plays Henry DeTamble, a man with a genetic disorder that makes him involuntarily time travel. Over the course of the movie he meets a young girl, Clare (as an adult, played by Rachel McAdams), who he tells this to and he continues to meet her at different stages of her life until they eventually get married. Of course, being that he sometimes disappears for days, even weeks, at a time this isn't the easiest relationship to be in, and this is where the film mines a lot of the emotional content. The audience is spoon-fed plot details as is seen fit, but you'd have to be blind not to see where things eventually go. This is actually my biggest problem with the film. There was no spontaneity to it, and it was extremely predictable. Granted, there are a number of scenes which are touching, not least of which is the opening scene where Henry loses his mother, but they all feel overly constructed. Also, given the tricky subject of time travel, there's a lot of logical holes in how things work because they never attempt to explain it and there are (seemingly) inconsistencies in how it is used, especially when Henry has a daughter with Clare. It seemed like the writers thought this would be a cool gimmick to use as a plot device rather than think out the logistics of how it would actually work. Overall, the performances were decent. Eric Bana and Rachel Adams do a great job in the roles they were given to play and their relationship was fleshed out enough to be somewhat believable. The supporting characters, however, aren't given too much to do and there is a plot twist involving one of them that almost came off as a throwaway moment. The score, while beautiful to listen to and having an appropriate amount of magic and wonder befitting the subject matter, was somewhat manipulative and helped a little too much in telling the audience what to feel. There were moments when I could start to feel myself welling up, but then I'd just remind myself that the music had a large part in that and the feeling would go away as the moment passed. Overall, I do feel like this was a well-made, if unspectacular, film on a technical level, but it fails to tell an emotionally truthful story that stands on its own without a ridiculously silly plot construct. Fans of romantic dramas will probably enjoy this, as might fans of the book, but for me it was merely watchable instead of great. (2.5/5)",1418515200,2,2637,4.6127659574468085

The premise is obvious, a man bounces around uncontrollably in time, and meets his wife to be when she is still a child, but neither of them realize it at first.

We see his life in the sequence that he lives it.

It would be interesting to see a movie from the wife's point of view, childhood up through all of their shared life. (Sort of like Robert Heinlein let us see Lazarus Long's life from his point of view, including when, 2000 years later, he went back in time to meet his birth family, then in a later book, he let us experience his mother's life, including that same period of time when her 2000 year old son came back in time to visit, not knowing who he was.)

I look forward to a sequel, seeing life as experienced by

3633657,5,B001HN69CC,"Some SPOILERS ahead:

I absolutely love this movie. Every time I sit down and watch it, I have a smile on my face all the way until it starts to get sad. It has romance and sci-fi, and I enjoy both of these, but I do enjoy the latter mostly. I would definitely recommend this movie, but it is not for everyone. So, maybe rent it first just to make sure you will enjoy it.

Also, the blu ray makes the movie that much more enjoyable :)",1399248000,,434,3.9770114942528734
3633658,5,B001HN69CC,I purchased this based upon my liking of the one seen on television and would prefer to see it again and again without commercials.,1399248000,,131,4.5

A love story for all ages!
You will remember this one for a long time.",1398902400,,102,4.15
3633660,5,B001HN69CC,Loved this movie.  It is a great rendering of the book.  The story line is thought provoking especially the aspects of his daughter and self meeting and working together.  Usually science fiction says that a great calamity will occur if you meet your earlier self.,1398643200,,264,4.822222222222222
3633661,4,B001HN69CC,"First of all, this is in no way, shape, or form as good as the book, which is an absolute favorite of mine. It isn't easy putting actors in place of the characters in my mind. That being said, I was comfortable with the casting here. It started a bit shaky for me, but once I settled in, it was abundantly clear to me that while you cannot transfer all of the pages of the book into a mere two-hour film, you can do it justice. And this film did. It definitely got across the depth of pain and angst and emotion Clare feels in falling in love with a man who is helpless to the whims of the universe... Because it isn't about him and the amazing gift/curse of his time traveling. It's about the woman who waits years to meet him, who falls hard for him, who loves him even knowing that at any time it could all come to an end.

I watched this with my husband who is not a reader, and it was really nice to share this story I loved so much with him. Again, not nearly as good as the written word, but notably well done nonetheless.",1398556800,,1029,4.044117647058823
3633662,5,B001HN69CC,"Saw it in theater in 2009.  One of the best time travel movies I have ever seen, and the actors' chemistry is wonderful.  Not bogged down in the sci-fi at all, but concentrated on the drama.  And a different take on time travel than you probably ever saw before.  If you have not seen this, at least rent it and you'll love it.",1397779200,,327,4.142857142857143
3633663,2,B001HN69CC,"There didn't seem to be a plot to follow or purpose, or lesson, resolution, or anything, I felt like the storyline floated aimlessly, couldn't follow what the intention was getting at. I felt like it was fundamentally missing some big aspects to a film or story.

3633866,3,B001HN69CC,"This review starts with the usual caveat: The book's better.

The movie seemed obsessed with jumping from on ""time travel episode"" to another without ever putting them into context.  I think they got all the book's time travel episodes into a 1:45 movie.  As a result of all this frenetic disappearance by ""Henry"" there was never time for characters to develop.  No time even for a storyline to develop for that matter.  While the ""threat"" of disappearance hangs (in a good way) over the entire story there were very few scenes in the movie that didn't include at least 1 disappearance.  The last scene of the movie had Henry thanking Gomez for being such a good friend and I think they had 2 conversations in the whole movie and this was his ""best friend.""

They tried to do the time travel episodes justice without giving the story a chance to develop.  I will not critique the performers as I think they did what they could with a bad script of a great story.",1391904000,,962,4.520231213872832

I can't reveal it without a spoiler, but the ending in the book was much more poignant, while this was just a big ""Oh, no, he didn't."" Rachel McAdams hit her acting high in ""the Notebook"" and her acting in this one was just so-so.

3634008,5,B001HN69CC,"I began watching the movie just a few hours after finishing reading the book.

This movie was really well done. Most of the dialog came straight from the book. I can understand that a lot was left out. A lot of the steamy scenes were toned down and a lot of the content was a bit sanitized for the big screen.

I was kind of disappointed with the end because the end of the book was really well done. But again, I can understand how this wouldn't have looked as good on screen.

The chemistry of the leading actors was great... but a few of the scenes on the beginning looked a bit out of sync it didn't look as convincing. You could notice the actor's intention a bit too much in a few of the scenes. As if the director didn't bother to do one more take to have it ""just right""

In all I think the adaptation was quite a challenge since the book was so rich. I thought some important parts of the plot were left out... or if you didn't read the book you would have a different interpretation of it.

Still, I think this is a solid movie and it gets 5 star on entertainment value. One of those movies that you don't mind watching again.",1379635200,,1136,4.122171945701357

Then a few weeks ago, the movie came on tv, I only caught the last hour of it, I cried in the end, picked up the book and finished it that night and the next day, then ordered the movie from amazon.

better, are more likely to appreciate the story, which is basically a romance with a
Sci-Fi base.  The reviews are interesting.  It appears the can't sit still, attention
deficit, and/or emotionally immature types could not appreciate the emotional depth of
the film.  Not enough bloody action, gratuitous sex, or grab-ass sophomoric humor for
them I guess.  The acting is realistic, well in character, and believable.  Loved the
music, a bit unusual in its construction, but which added much to the film. I will buy
the DVD for my film library.",1376956800,,631,4.915094339622642

While unrealistic, there were twists and turns in the plot which came together well in the end.

I thought their voices were appropriate for the characters in the book.  Not the best book I've listened to but I didn't find myself checking to see how much longer I had to go to finish the book, which is my indicator that the book should be rated a one or two star.

3634698,5,B001HN69CC,"The easiest, most helpful way to describe ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is to call it a Sci-Fi Chick Flick. Here's why:

Sci-Fi:
Involves time travel
Delves into the psychological, scientific, and familial issues related to time travel

Chick Flick:
It's primarily about a romance
It's slightly cheesy

If you're okay with all those traits, I'd highly suggest it. Yes, it's a little cheesy at times, but because of the depth of the issues it deals with it ends up being a worthwhile watch.",1354492800,,486,4.831325301204819

3634829,1,B001HN69CC,"You really must have a yen for drama on the unfulfilling and dour side to enjoy this movie. It's not that the whole of The Time Traveler's Wife is dripping with sadness, but there is a great deal of unfulfilled longing throughout the whole of the movie.

The Premise:
Henry has a genetic mutation that makes him travel through time. He can not control it. He has no clue when he'll make his next jump through the space time continuum. And oh, just for added fun, he can't take his clothes with him so he always arrives at some unexpected time naked!

Even for a science fiction movie that would be too much of a stretch. Isaac Asimov, the great science, history and science fiction writer, said that the difference between science fiction and fantasy is that a science fiction world is a scenario that we could at least conceivably get to with appropriate changes in technology, but a fantasy world is exactly that.

The idea that a genetic mutation could make Henry time travel is just too far fetched, even for a fantasy movie.

As far as the plot goes, there's just not much there. Most of the movie is about what a drag it is that Henry travels through time without warning. The rest of the movie is about their daughter Alba and discussing and discovering if she will time travel as well, except for the ending. The ending seemed like it was quickly written to be pointlessly dramatic and sad, like a distilled few minutes of the rest of the movie. I didn't think it was sad because it just wasn't believable. I just thought it was too contrived and it was a poor ending, like an airplane that can't quite get off the ground. Then it does a quick nose dive and that's the end of Mister Airplane.

On The Up Side:
The actors are superb! Eric Bana played Henry, the main character. Rachel McAdams played Clare, his wife. Hailey McCann played Alba, their daughter, at the ages of 9 and 10. They are all incredibly talented!

Hailey absolutely shines! She's glowing with energy and zest for life. She was the best part of the whole movie. She deserves to be in movies with subtly nuanced stories and happy people.

From the other reviews, I gathered that many people actually liked this movie. Well, for people who like dramas with simple stories, I can see them enjoying it and that's fine. To each his own. But if you're a creative type with a strong imagination, and/or you like stories with some complexity, this movie will look so two dimensional to you. And if you like movies with some humor and a few happy scenes, this is definitely a movie that will leave you hungry for something that's sprinkled with laughter and happiness.

To quote Danny from The Gradual Report, ""Final summation!"" This definitely is not a good date movie or a movie to watch with your significant other. You want a movie with more depth, at least a few cheerful scenes, some real excitement and a happy ending but The Time Traveler's Wife just doesn't deliver that.",1342137600,5,2949,4.540489642184557

3634885,4,B001HN69CC,"I love movies about Time Travel, and I loved the refreshing premise of this movie, namely, what it would be like to be married to someone who time travels involuntarily, sometimes at the most inopportune and important moments. Indeed, what would it be like to be that time traveler?

The natural metaphor to real life would be when your loved one is not present in your life, and how would you deal with it. If you take it for what it is without exploring it too much, this could be quite an interesting movie, a time travel story and a love story.

If you're like me though, and you do explore, it's a different story. I like that the author breaks the mould of Time Travel stories. For example, in Back to the Future, Marty McFly can travel back in time, and he can see but not meet his previous self, because that would be like matter and anti matter colliding and would be potentially a catastrophic encounter. Also, McFly can do things in the past which alter the reality of now.

In TTW, Henry can travel and meet and give his 5 year old self a blanket after his first traumatic time travel experience, yet things he does in the past cannot change the way things are now.

Even though he cannot change history, he attempts to do so a hundred times.

Henry says he cannot control when he travels or where he goes, yet when he meets the girl in the meadow, he says: 'I will see you next Tuesday at 4,' and he does. How can he do this if he cannot control his TT experiences?

When Clare meets him as an adult for the first time in reality, he does not recognise her, yet she has all these memories going back to 6, this makes no sense whatsoever. If he cannot change history by going back into the past, then how can he meet this girl at age 6, and be able to influence her to seek him out as an adult who has not yet met her? Also, this meeting in the meadow business between a middle aged man and a little girl, a wee bit odd.

Other than that TTW did sustain my interest to the end and does have some touching moments.

TTW stars Rachel McAdams of The Notebook, a top 100 rental on a leading online site for the past several years, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Eye-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B000BVM1SC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Eye (Full Screen Edition)</a>, an outstanding thriller which I own.

 The storyline is attractive and the movie is emotionally fulfilled. I wonder why Clare is willing to spend her life with a time-traveler who always keeps her waiting, and she doesn't even know when he would disappear and when he would be back. The story shows that love could be so hard: The distance between Henry and Clare because of Henry's uncontrollable time-traveling; Clare's continuous miscarriages; and the portent of Henry's death, all these are heartbreaking and poignant. It is remarkably distressing when Henry knows he is getting closer and closer to the death. The last moment when Henry appears again after his death sticks me most, since the family can at least have a reunion!
 A fly in the ointment of the movie may be that there are little confusions about the jumping in time. I look forward to reading the novel version to find out what is elided from the original and to get a better sense.",1321574400,,936,4.736196319018405
3634939,1,B001HN69CC,"Some spoilers ahead

After reading a lot of other reviews here which suggest that the book is fantastic, I'm thinking that maybe this is a book that just doesn't translate to film. I did not read the book and I thought the both actors did a great job with the material....I just thought that it was obvious that the screenplay was working too hard to explain everything that the whole thing seemed contrived. So instead of concentrating on the the characters, what they are experiencing...you are too busy putting together a plot that really isn't the right kind of plot for a movie. This movie lost me at the  time travelling fetus. Maybe this works in the book, but the way it's presented in the movie it's just ridiculous. So then he doesnt tell her but gets the operation which is also ridiculous--its an obvious plot trick because no one does that in real life without discussing it with their spouse. Then she cheats on him with an earlier version of himself...this was like desperate housewives meets back to the future when I was expecting The Notebook.

By the time I got around to wanting to see it in theaters, it was already gone. It's really a shame because it's a wonderfully crafted love story, using a touch of sci-fi as a backdrop for the plot. I'm a guy and don't normally go for love stories. Without the sci-fi angle, I probably would not have gone for this film. I like hard science fiction, space battles, and aliens, but most of all, I like an interestingly told story. Here you have a really well told story with likable and implausibly good-looking characters.

For her, there's the bare-butted Eric Bana (Henry), who arrives naked with each jump. For him, there's the gorgeous Rachael McAdams, who sadly, we do not see in extended stretches of undress.

The premise is simple. Because of a genetic anomaly, Henry jumps uncontrollably through time, along the timeline of his life. He meets people in his past and sometimes himself, but he can't change the past. Just like other time travel movies, don't think too much about paradoxes, contradictions, and logic bombs. If you do, you'll have a horrible time. Just go with it and concentrate on the love story instead. The chemistry between Bana and McAdams is electric. There are some touching scenes at the end as well, but I won't say more than that.

Not twist endings or last-minute gotchas that are so in vogue these days, or anything groundbreaking in terms of cinematography or style. This is just a good ole-fashioned romance done with innocence and charm, much like Forest Gump and Benjamin Button. It's entertaining and light-hearted -- definitely worth the time to watch it.",1317600000,8,1941,5.139240506329114

3634944,2,B001HN69CC,"This might be a case in which the book is better than the movie. I hope it is.

I like good romances, and the premise of this one has potential. But I never get a sense of why Clare loves Henry. It's easy enough to understand why Henry would fall for Clare: She is beautiful, intelligent, and she loves him unconditionally, from early childhood, in fact. It's been said that Clare must learn to love what is ""essential"" about Henry, no matter what his age. But I couldn't get any sense of what was essential about Henry. I couldn't even figure out how he managed to work as a librarian, since he can disappear without warning at any moment. In fact, how does he manage to hide his problem from any of the people he knows and works with?

Spoilers: In order to introduce some kind of pathos into the story, Clare has a series of miscarriages. Henry's intentions are good, but he stupidly gets a vasectomy so that he and his wife no longer have to go through the anguish. He should have realized that Clare could still get pregnant from his pre-vasectomy self. The movie does not explain why Henry never sees his future daughter until after she is born. Neither does the movie explain why he only seems to go back and forth between being with Clare or being in a back alley or in the snow. Well, one time he shows up in a lion's den at the zoo, but that is the exception.

I've heard that the book doesn't get into explaining the mechanics of the time-traveling, and that is fine, but I would hope that it provides more insight into Henry, Clare, and that biggest mystery of all, Love.",1313452800,5,1583,4.359322033898305

3635016,4,B001HN69CC,"The Time Traveler's Wife was released in theatres on August 14, 2009 and on DVD February 09, 2010. It stars Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams and was directed by Robert Schwentke.
Henry DeTamble, played by Bana, is five years old when he discovers, in a most tragic way, his amazing ability to travel through time. As Henry ages and continues through his life, popping in and out of different times, he meets Clare Abshire, played by McAdams, as a young child. Realizing that he often visits the same location more than once, the two become fast friends, he as a man and she as a child. They continue to meet in a meadow throughout Clare's life. When the two finally meet as adults, Clare already knows the details of Henry's unusual gift and has loved the man her whole life. Together they begin anew and embark on a journey of love and family, all the while seeking some sense of normalcy in their awkward circumstances.
The only question that remains is, can love endure the tests of time and time travel? Eric Bana plays a magnificent role as Henry the time traveler and Rachel McAdams is sweet and endearing as Clare. I believe my advantage with watching The Time Traveler's Wife, was that I had not read the novel prior to seeing the DVD, therefore it was easy to view the film and not be biased by any prior knowledge of the book. The Time Traveler's Wife is romantic and beautiful and it's characters complex and memorable.
I am giving The Time Traveler's Wife a 4-star rating. Do I think you should see this film? A thousand times 'Yes'.

""Due to a genetic disorder, handsome librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) involuntarily zips through time, appearing at various moments in the life of his true love, the beautiful artist Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Also starring Ron Livingston as Gomez, the soul-stirring romantic drama was adapted from the best-selling Audrey Niffenegger novel by Bruce Joel Rubin, the screenwriter behind the beloved weepy Ghost.""",1310342400,,683,4.921739130434783

3635019,4,B001HN69CC,"The Time Traveler's Wife, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger's enchanting second novel of the same title, is the story of Henry DeTamble (the Time Traveler) and Clare Abshire (the Time Traveler's Wife). Clare first meets Henry when she is six years old and he suddenly appears, naked, in the Meadow near her home: he's thirty-six at the time. On the other hand, Henry first meets Clare in the library where he works, when he's twenty-eight and she's twenty. Henry has a condition called Chrono-Displacement Disorder, which has him disappearing and reappearing into various times in the past and future. This is ultimately a beautiful love story with a time-travel twist, which adds a different dimension to the story: humour in some parts, horror or heartache in others. Whilst no movie can encompass all of a book, this one is none-the-less fairly faithful to the book. While I might not have picked Eric Bana for this role, he portrays Henry very well, and Rachel McAdams brings Clare to life beautifully.

I don't recall the Red Box DVD having special features, but the DVD that Amazon shipped had a great behind the scenes featurette about adapting the book to screen.

So many people who gave this movie a 1 star rating, did so because the movie did not live up to the expectations the book set for them. If they watch the featurette they would learn about the decisions which were made in the process of adapting the story for the silver screen. I thought it was great. And I loved that Rachael McAdams was a huge fan of the book and fantasized that she would play Clare's role when/if the movie was ever made.

The thing which I liked best about this movie was how the time travel can be seen as a metaphor for so many things that happen in a regular marriage. A real tear jerker for me. (and my husband likes it too)

To give my opinion simply: The book is amazing - one of my absolute favorites, but the movie is a disappointment.

3635100,3,B001HN69CC,"Overall it is a reasonable love story with a twist of science fiction (though I'm not sure I would consider it a sci fi movie by any stretch).
The story follows one man (played by the talented Eric Bana from ""Blackhawk Down"", etc.), who has the ability to travel through time (if you're looking for some deep and scientific reason as to why he can you might be disappointed), and starts visiting his wife (played by the older Rachel Adams from ""The Notebook"" and ""Wedding Crashers"") when she is still a little girl.  The story flashes back and forward (depending on how you track your time) and develops a friendship with her (she of course doesn't know yet this is the man she will marry though she does develop a crush on him).  The main focus of the story, is their relationship, and how they deal with him popping in and out of her life.
While I understood the story, I didn't see the point of it.  Normally there's a point to every story, something you leave the movie with.  This one, it seemed like the story was, if you truly love someone, then be prepared if they are a time traveler?  I got a tad confused with the jumping around in time.  I almost felt I needed a flowchart to keep track of it all.  I consider myself a somewhat intelligent person, and it was slight overkill popping back and forth without giving us a title timeline.  I doubt I was the only one that had a problem with this.
Obviously great acting, and nice directing.  My issues, were a lack of stronger purpose to the story, and a stronger delivery of that story onto the screen where it doesn't hurt my head to keep track of what time period I'm in.  If it had been me, I would have spent my money funding another project.
If you're looking for a romantic movie, time traveling doesn't bother you, and you don't care bee-bopping around in time, and you don't need to come out of the movie with any revelations, or you're sick in bed and just want something somewhat interesting to pass the time, this might be just the ticket.",1296604800,,2008,4.388140161725067

He was perfect in that role because he expresses emotions so well on camera and looks great, too (there are some impressive shots of Eric sans clothes.) He really captured the heart of the character. I loved Rachel McAdams in this movie, too. I really connected with both of them in this movie. Anyway, I much prefer the movie to the novel because read the book back in 2005 and one part of the book really bugged me (with Gomez) and I thought it ruined the novel, which I had thought was awesome up until that point. I was thrilled to see that they nixed that scene when creating the screenplay used for the movie. And with Brad Pitt as the producer... now that was just too cool! Again, great love story. Great acting. Movie not ruined with a scene that should've been cut from the novel. Loved this!",1294444800,,1024,4.366492146596858

This story was unexpectedly thoughtful and poignant; and it offered up surprising ideas and concepts. The pacing was non-Hollywood-style (i.e., patient); the dialogue was not glib or superficial; the characters were believable; and the story presented unanticipated plot-twists which I will not spoil for you here.

The ending (which could have been convoluted and confusing, a la ""Lake House"") engaged both my mind and my heart.

Must have been author Audrey Niffenegger who made up these names, right?  I loved the movie and cried real tears at a certain moment towards the end, but I kept thinking, those names have got to mean something!

Finally I thought, they've got to be anagrams, and it didn't take two minutes to cut up little pieces of paper and write C and L and A and R and E, etc., on one set, and then write Henry's name on another set.  Instantly I could swap the letters in Clare's name and form that of ""Isabel Archer,"" the heroine of Henry James' 1881 novel THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY, one of my favorite books!

I still have my little scraps of paper for Henry's name, but I am embarrassed to say, I can't make them say anything (except ""Tremble Hayden"" and that doesn't mean very much!)--now probably fans have already worked out these names and I'm a johnny come lately but, if anyone has the answer could you post it to me please?",1294099200,4,1083,4.315270935960591

Top three, easy, and most days it takes the #1 spot. I also really, really like Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, and indeed, my opinion of them did not waver at all after watching this movie.

My big problem with this movie was the screenplay. It was too sad. It's not a terribly happy story in the book, of course, but there are a lot of very light moments that provide a much needed levity that the movie just ignored. So instead of a well-balanced movie of light and dark moments, we get a movie that only hits the low points of the book. One specific example I can think of from the book is a spontaneous dance party to ""1999"" with ""baby punks"". Or the scene where Henry saves the dinner that Clare tried to make. Little tiny scenes that didn't mean much on their own, but that balanced out a lot of the sad.(Of course, if you've not read the book, I know this is hogwash to you, and I apologize).",1293408000,,1025,4.1767676767676765

While the novel is certainly a little more edgy than the film, the movie does not try to cover up the shear audacity to tell a story where the character spontaneously travels through time. While it does take some libertys with the story, I appreciated this because it added surprise when you're least expecting it. McAdams is wonderful but Eric Bana truly makes this film.

3635163,3,B001HN69CC,"I ordered this movie because my wife said that she'd like to see it.  And, since I'd been subjecting her to a rather lengthy parade of explosion and war movies lately, I felt some obligation to lighten things up a bit.

I generally like the theme of time travel, and if the movie looks good, I'll give it a look.  This movie seemed to have too much of the time travel element, though...almost to the point where it became irritating.  It was as if the main character had absolutely no control over when he was going to be transported to another place and time.  If he lost control of his emotions, it was WHOOSH...off he'd go!  Then, he'd have to hunt for a new set of clothes when he got there.  The little girl/later lover/later wife got to the point where she'd just leave clothes out in the woods for him.

In general, the movie is OK, but I think that it could've been much better done.  Without giving too much away, there is a time travel scene in which Eric Bana meets some hunters, and the technical aspects of the scene are such that it's incredibly cheesy, as well as obvious that it was contrived in a studio and in post production.

Even my wife apologized for making me buy the movie.  She agreed that most of my action and war movies were much better done.  It's watchable, but it'd be a better Netflix or Vudu rent than a Blu Ray buy.",1289174400,,1350,4.292490118577075
3635164,5,B001HN69CC,"Alright, I had absolutely NO idea what to expect when I began watching the Time Traveler's Wife.  Oh boy- I'll never forget the experience!

Ever wonder what would happen if you had a boyfriend or girlfriend that, for some unexplainable and confusing reason, just disappeared at random?  Let's say from the time you were a little boy or girl you were led to believe that your future girlfriend or boyfriend disappearing and reappearing whenever is totally normal?

Wouldn't this actually get *really* annoying after a while?  Wouldn't it start becoming more of an inconvenience as you plan events ahead of time and then they get abruptly cancelled all because your girlfriend or boyfriend simply disappeared without any kind of warning?  It SHOULD get annoying.

Apparently however, according to the writers who came up with such a concept, it's actually adorable.  At least, that's what we're led to believe during the first half of the film.  That it's every girls fantasy.

Eventually the girlfriend gets fed up with her boyfriends frequent little inconvenient disappearing act when she becomes pregnant.  Then things change a lot.  ""No more disappearing acts for you, Mr. Boyfriend!  It's time to raise a baby together"" cries the girlfriend.  Okay so the events don't unravel *quite* so hilariously, but as a viewer sitting there trying to make any logical sense out of time travelling, well, it only seems normal to find some kind of humor in something so silly and unbelievable.

The storyline jumps through numerous events throughout the girlfriend and boyfriends lives, and it even gets insanely confusing whenever you see a grown man talking to his girlfriend when she's still a *child*.  Then throw in numerous events involving the daughter and the disappearing mans own mother and... WOW, haha (hence my title!).

What's particularly interesting about the whole thing is how the film doesn't really focus on one specific genre- it's funny at times, filled with drama elements other times, and get THIS- there's even a subtle element of horror!  Yes it's true.  This is because quite often you will actually get to see the boyfriend disappear before your very eyes.  There's a couple other scenes that really DID mess with my head that only the most effective horror storylines are capable of doing.  Weird and shocking.

The humor comes in the way of where the boyfriend will turn up next (and naked) whenever he disappears.

Overall, you have to be somewhat patient, understanding and perhaps a little bit bonkers to really fall in love with a movie like this.  ""What WILL that crazy disappearing boyfriend do *next?*"" is a question you will be asking yourself several times over.",1289088000,,2692,5.024830699774267

To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The setting was absolutely gorgeous and the actors did a great job.  The romance was a bit rushed (as compared to the book), but the love between the two still felt strong and their relationship was still just as beautiful.  I sobbed throughout much of the last 30 minutes!!
My main complaint is similar to what I did not like about the book - the whole issue of time travel was not addressed too well.  There are dizzying aspects to time travel that the book just completely overlooks.  But I cannot rate the movie too harshly on this negative since it is trying to stay true to the book.

I feel like there are no real feelings or ""chemistry"" between the characters of McAdams and Bana. It was all about the sex or something. Supposedly they knew each other in a past time or a future encounter, but it didn't come across at all. It felt like they were strangers most of the time.  Clare (McAdams) admits she doesn't even know him well. There will never be a stable relationship in this time traveling business. The conflict between Henry DeTamble (Bana) and his father is a bit more interesting. I knew Henry was going to disappear before the wedding. The reception was so bleak. How much did they spend on that set? One thousand? For some odd reason Clare begins to get upset with Henry about his coming and going. I thought she knew what she was getting into. Then if things weren't confusing enough, Henry's daughter time travels and her daughter time travels. I found Dr. David Kendrick (Stephen Tobolowsky) entertaining. Overall, this film is a bit depressing for me, and not in a good way. It also runs a bit slow. Also, the lighting was so dark, adding to the depressiveness. I am sure the book must be finer opposed to the film. I just didn't buy into the ""romance"". Wasn't a tear jerker for me.

3635229,3,B001HN69CC,"I did not read the book and I knew next to nothing about the film plot when sitting down to view this film. But I'd heard the title a thousand times and thought it sounded interesting. I tend to multi-task when I watch films at home so this movie viewing session was not an exception. About 20 minutes into the film I asked my husband if folding laundry was keeping me from getting what was going on. He said that the movie was confusing and laundry folding was not the problem.

Then after a few more naked guy shots I started to follow the plot. Skin shots? Henry, the time traveler, leaves his clothes behind him, landing naked wherever he's sent. And the odd thing is, that wherever he landed, it seems the whole plot point was to find clothes and hope to get back home. And home would find him landing naked and finding the clothes left for him and sometimes being swept away elsewhere, hoping to survive the whole process again. Survival? It's dangerous? Apparently some folks didn't like naked guys stealing their clothes, suddenly appearing in their homes, or the natural elements weren't necessarily friendly, not once did he land on a nude beach.

The time jumping lasted varying bits of time. Sometimes mere minutes passed, other times, weeks. I also struggled with liking the characters enough to suspend disbelief over the fact that Henry was able to hold a job for a portion of the film. Or that his landing, naked, in the woods behind the meadow of his future wife's home, when she was but a wee little lass, was anything less than just creepy-wrong. The marital disputes were a little too frequent and the back and forth future/past/future/present/past visits got tedious.

There were some intriguing moments like the scientific parts and pieces. Henry was born with a genetic flaw that whips him back and forth through his life and he is able to visit himself at different points.

I'm not recommending the movie, but i could see fans of the book wanting to see this film. The film, for me, was not an enticement to read the novel, though.",1284595200,2,2056,4.624657534246575
3635230,2,B001HN69CC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

All romantic movies chronicle the progress of a romantic relationship as it (usually) triumphs over many small obstacles, or one major obstacle. In romantic fantasy movies, the obstacle or obstacles are supernatural. However, regardless of the nature of the obstacle, a romantic movie will succeed in moving us only if the couple portrayed is multifaceted, complex, sympathetic, sensible, and endearing. If the couple is not, they are in danger in being upstaged by the obstacle or obstacles opposing their union. In my opinion, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" suffers from the latter condition.

""The Time Traveler's Wife"" chronicles the tortured progress of the romantic relationship between Chicago librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and heiress/aspiring artist Clare (Rachel McAdams). The obstacle that dogs them before and after their marriage is a diabolically tragic doozy: Henry is genetically predisposed to time travel randomly and unwillingly throughout his life (called chrono-displacement in the movie) whenever he is stressed, drunk, or emotionally distraught. Even worse, he must do so stark naked (a la the Terminator) because his clothing is not organic and therefore must find clothes in the time period he lands in (past, present, and even future) before he suffers social embarrassment, arrest for indecent exposure, or sickness like hypothermia. As I said, it's a doozy of a problem, and it detracts from Henry and Clare's relationship, sweet and gentle as it is.

Of course, the time travel angle dredges up all the usual paradoxes (e.g. you can't change the past, alternate time-lines, past/present/future versions of yourself). But the movie complicates the paradox even further by having nearly infinite versions of Henry (from five-year old child to middle-age adult) flitting back and forth through time. Sometimes, implausibly, these different versions meet each other (wouldn't they explode on contact, like matter/anti-matter). Furthermore, Henry's appearances and disappearances are unpredictable. Not only does Clare not know when Henry will return from his bare romps, she doesn't even know which Henry will return. But she has the patience of Penelope waiting for Odysseus, and she treats Henry's condition mostly as an inconvenience.

Clare's cavalier attitude towards Henry's condition is stupefying, even for a romantic fantasy. Doesn't she realize Henry is subject to a tragic curse? Why haven't the couple tried to find a cure earlier on in the relationship? Why didn't Henry and his father, who knows his son has the condition, try to cure him when he was a boy or a teenager? Life must have been hell growing up. Still, Henry amazingly appears to be a fundamentally well-adjusted and stable person. One would think his condition would have eroded his sanity and made him suicidal.

Some posters advise to treat the time-travel angle as a plot device and just enjoy the budding romance and marriage. I couldn't. Without the suspense of knowing when and where Henry would vanish, the romance is actually pretty vapid and pedestrian. Henry and Clare certainly make an attractive, sexy couple, but they seem to be boring, ordinary people leading boring, ordinary lives. Even their creepily precocious daughter Alba is interesting only because she has inherited her father's time-traveling ability and can even control it to some extent. More detrimentally, Clare at times comes across as a slightly whiny, precious princess a bit too focused on her own needs. For example, she gets upset at Henry when he reappears after having missed Christmas and New Years. Honey, the dude can't help it. At that point, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"" should have been playing on the soundtrack. Also, she wants a baby so desperately that even though one version of Henry (""the"" version, I guess) gets a vasectomy to avoid having a child who will suffer his curse, she ""cheats"" on that version with a younger, ""fully functional"" version of Henry and conceives Alba in a car in a Chicago parking lot.

Not even death can really bring poor Henry release; toward the end of the movie, Henry reappears naked in the meadow where he first met his future bride when she was six. This time, however, it's winter and Clare's boorish hunter father mistakes him for a deer and kills him. No matter, there will always be another version of Henry (young or old) to visit and comfort Clare. So immortal love conquers all! Does it makes your eyes tear up? Oh, please, it made my eyes roll!

If you want to see a better constructed and involving romantic fantasy involving the undeniably handsome and magnetic Eric Bana, I'd suggest watching Ang Lee's Hulk. His relationship with Jennifer Connelly's character is more intricate, plangent, and affecting. Besides, he gets to keep his pants on (most of the time) even after he transforms into the Hulk.

P.S:  I theorize that Henry's chrono-displacement genes must be recessive, because neither of his parents could time travel.  Therefore, both parents must have been chrono-displacement gene carriers and gave their recessive genes to Henry when he was born.

3635231,5,B001HN69CC,"I just got done watching this movie.  I have been a fan of the novel for years now, and I had put off seeing the film because I was worried it hadn't done one of my favorite stories justice.  The film was met with mixed reviews, and I wasn't ready to see it if it was a trainwreck. Now, having seen it finally, I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with the movie, and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to a fan of the novel.  I think it should hang together very well for anyone who hasn't read it, but I honestly can't say that for 100% certain, since I just don't have that perspective as a longtime fan of the novel.  I am a huge sci fi fan, and I love that this story uses a sci fi concept to drive it places very little sci fi ever bothers to go (the pure love story).  It's certainly a love story first with an almost subtle sci fi element.  It's also a story about family, and, as a father, I found it quite emotionally poignant.

As a person who knows the story, I found the movie faithful to the original material and the actors cast as perfectly as could be hoped for.  The acting was excellent, and the decisions that had to be made to condense this story into just under a 2-hour movie were the right ones.  Very little is changed from the book, but, most importantly, the main thrust of this basically tragic love story is kept intact.

I have to say, where the novel seems to me to have an almost gritty feel in a lot of places, the movie defaults to a much more beautiful, and also somber tone.  Gone are the references to 70's punk rock and the more rough and bizarre nature of some of Henry's travels are not focused on so much.  Even so, it worked.  It still felt like the same story, and it still worked just as well--though slightly differently, on you.  The settings are rich and emotions are sincere.  It is a gorgeous film.

I am not sure what someone who hadn't read the book would make of it if they weren't open to a sci fi twist, however some reviews here indicate that it works very well even without having read the book.  I think the film and the novel version are almost complementary.  I do like them both equally well.  I am dumbfounded by some of the extremely uncomplimentary reviews here calling the film ridiculous or too silly to get through.  All one can assume is the sci fi element the story is built around just isn't somewhere some people's brains can go.  It's a classic sci fi movie disconnect with a large chunk of the viewing public, though, and should have been expected.

Bottom line: if you have been putting off seeing this movie because of the mixed reviews, forget them and just see it.

Basically, the review ends here except for the comment below, which is a possible minor spoiler . . .

 ::: Possible Spoiler Alert - Don't Read Before Seeing Movie ::: There may be some who weren't sure about the way the ending was handled, but readers of the novel are still left with their, or ""the real,"" ending by how/where the movie left things.  I thought it was perfect, especially because it leaves the book's ending completely still intact, but a special thing only readers of the novel get to appreciate.",1283904000,,3167,4.316412859560067
3635232,5,B001HN69CC,"I know this is not a typical ""guy movie"", and I'm a fairly athletic, un-feminized 55 year old male.  I've NEVER read a romance novel.  I've traveled as a consultant for way too many weeks of the year for years, as I'm such a specialist in a niche profession (customizing and implementing major clinical information systems) that there is no work for me in rural S. Illinois, so either we move (lots of issues there) or I travel.

I saw it on HBO, twice actually as I caught it the 1st time a little bit in, so watched it again the next day.

Triggered a lot of thoughts about my wife and our relationship.  We met my freshman year in college and I never went out with anyone else after.

I ended up calling her several hours after the 2nd viewing, letting her know I'd been thinking about her and that I missed her.  I periodically say ""I love you"" or ""I've been thinking about you"", but I can't honestly say I can remember the last time I said ""I miss you"".

I have read some reviews of this movie that panned it, that came across as the viewpoint of at least partially jaded purists.

I've never commented on a movie before and would never envision myself as a critic.

The movie works, and I believe it touches heart.  In the process (watching, thinking after), it makes you reflect on the things that ultimately matter much more that what unfortunately frequently occupies our attention.",1283731200,,1391,4.437007874015748
3635233,3,B001HN69CC,"I like Rachel McA and I am so-so with Eric Bana ('Hulk' notwithstanding), but that wasn't enough for me. I've never read the book, so I can't comment on what was missing or changed. I don't read a ton of books or watch movies using time-travel, but this one was a little hard to grip. I didn't really understand the movie until I went to the trusty IMDb boards. Basically the main thing you need to know is (((((((SPOILER COMING UP)))))))) is that there's a Past Henry, a Present Henry, and a Future Henry. HOWEVER, it is ALWAYS the PRESENT for whoever (Clare, Alba) in whatever timeframe he's in. So for example, when he meets 6 yr old Clare...that's HER present, but he's a FUTURE Henry. When he goes back, he's PRESENT Henry with PRESENT Clare. Also, regardless of everything, ""life"" has already happened or (for 6 yr old Clare) is scheduled to happen.

Or something like that. Honestly, my mind still hasn't totally grasped what I watched.

The movie was easy enough to watch, and one of the things I found interesting was that Future Henry never tried to influence past events. For example, he ""meets"" his mom on the train (FUTURE Henry meets the mom of 6 yr old Henry--again MOM'S present), but doesn't indicate to her that she's going to die. Also, he doesn't try to influence the outcome of his own tragedy.  However, at the same time, when Clare got the winning lottery ticket, he told her that she was going to win. So for me, it seemed like the movie influenced the events that it wanted to.

Again, ""life"" in this movie is going to happen regardless and the knowledge that Henry doesn't alter anything sort of makes for a confusing experience. Sometimes a jumbled mess. So the idea that just by being there Henry alters history is non-existent. Apparently, he's also unable to know where/when he will be when he travels, although he conveniently comes to the rescue (wedding day and the vasectomy day) on a couple of occasions.  One other thing that wasn't clear to me was at the end (((((SPOILER COMING UP))) when Henry travels to the future and sees Alba and Clare and tells Clare not to wait for him. Is this before or after Alba informs him of his death? And does that also mean that eventually he will stop appearing to them...once Present Henry actually dies? I guess I'd just be curious to know if death ends the time travel bc if Alba is 11...he should be dead and in theory, Clare shouldn't be waiting for him. Right?

Who knows. When the credits rolled I had tons of questions. The performances were decent, and I especially loved using two sisters to play Alba at ages 4/5 and 9/10.",1283558400,3,2605,4.543710021321962
3635234,1,B001HN69CC,"One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, featuring a complicated but ultimately stupid plot.  I had to stop it about once every fifteen minutes on account of being so dumbstruck by its inanity.

It's a time-travel story.  Sure, all time-travel stories have fatal contradictions at their core, but the best ones (e.g., Heinlein's ""The Door into Summer"") can at least get some good mileage out of the premise before things break down, as they inevitably must.

But this movie doesn't manage get an inch of mileage.  Instead the viewer is assaulted by the contradictions full on; they're shoved right in his face to the point where it's impossible to think of anything else.  Chiefly this is a result of their having made the script too complicated.

I supposed I would be more forgiving if the filmmakers had had enough presence of mind to develop the allegorical aspects of their premise more boldly (say, time-travelling as a metaphor for someone who cannot deal with his problems and when weighed down by life's fardels chooses to live in the past or simply daydream).  But if the authors of this script meant anything like that, the actual execution of the film really dropped the ball with it, as the director instead chose to focus on the quotidian difficulties of time-jumping (e.g., having no clothes) instead of any metaphorical meanings.",1283558400,3,1346,4.898678414096916
3635265,2,B001HN69CC,"Time travel should be intriguing--not goofy.  A genetic disorder that causes involuntary time travel, whereby the traveler arrives in the past, or future, in his birthday suit, and he has no control over how long he stays?  Plus said traveler must resort to breaking and entering to find clothes for his person, ticking off countless property owners and law enforcement personnel.

Like I said, goofy.  Pass the Pepcid.

Thus we have the silly mess that is THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  A confused-looking Eric Bana is the time traveler, a mild-mannered Chicago librarian who turns into a WWF brawler when he has to go find something to wear.  His ""disorder"" supposedly is beyond his control--he doesn't know when he'll disappear to travel in time, nor how long he'll be gone--yet at one point he tells his future wife, six at the time, the exact day he'll be back so that she may leave some of her father's clothes in the bushes for him.

This thing is more uneven than my latest P&L statement.

At the center of this silliness is a love story--the marriage of the time traveler and his starry-eyed wife (Rachel McAdams).  It goes without saying his popping in and out of her life produces considerable strain on the relationship.  A missed Christmas here, a zany wedding there, an image of him fatally wounded in the hallway for melodramatic effect, and that pretty much sums it up.  McAdams's character exhibits the patience of Job, which sets a good example for anyone wanting to watch the spectacle that is THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  Be prepared to be dazed, confused. . .and bored.

3635266,4,B001HN69CC,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" takes a simple approach to a time travel gimmick, and uses it to explore a very unique character study. Essentially, a boy learns that he travels in time when an older version of himself shows up at a traumatic moment to explain to him what is going on. Through his life, he is unable to control the mechanism of his time trips, which happen at random and often inconvenient moments.

In the process, as a young man our time traveling hero meets a little girl on a solo picnic. Over the years of her childhood and teenage years he appears several times, and she of course develops a crush on him. When they finally encounter each other as young adults of about the same age, they fall in love and marry. The movie's mechanism has two characters encountering each other almost randomly at various ages of the two people. This is a unique concept and was very interesting.

Complexities arise when it turns out that his time traveling curse is of genetic origin, and attempts at having a child result in unexplained miscarriages, and concomitant pressure on their relationship.

I found this to be a very sweet story. It promotes the interest of the viewer without the overly dramatic devices that most movies have to resort to. Tension is provided almost solely by the consequences of unexpected time travel incidents, rather than through character conflict. Although there is some character conflict, it is really minimal. There is a very simple story, a very simple romantic relationship, yet a very compelling movie.",1283040000,,1545,4.8226415094339625

3635268,4,B001HN69CC,"From what I'd been hearing THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE was a must see movie. I thought often about purchasing the book, and reading it first. I thought often about seeing the movie. My busy life didn't allow me to get to the movie theater, and the stack of unread books I have kept me from purchasing the book. Besides, I'm growing leery of reading a book prior to a movie. At least right before I know a movie is coming out, and it's in book form. When a book is so fresh in your mind, and the movie makes some major changes, and or leave some amazing parts out, its' hard to take. It's a whole other circumstance when I've read the book, and some time later, usually years; it comes out in movie form. I then HAVE to see it...if the book was good, of course.

While at the library the other day, I spotted THE TIME TRAVERL'S WIFE and didn't think twice about grabbing it. That very night I watched it.

After seeing the movie, though I know books are ALWAYS better, I'm glad I didn't purchase the book and read it. I believe I would have been thoroughly confused. But more than that I was a little mystified of what the story clearly missed in my eyes.

Why was he traveling back in time?

The movie was good in that it kept you interested. The acting was great. I even cried, yet I felt I was cheated. Cheated out of knowing the meaning to his travels. Why the author didn't make that know is beyond me. Or maybe it's me. Maybe I missed something. I just feel that if there was a clear reason for his travel, the story could have been hugely powerful; instead it left me wondering what'd it all mean. Why...

I'll still rate this movie high, and tell others that it was a good movie...just not great. Not great because the author missed their chance to make it great in my eyes. What a shame. But it was a unique romance if nothing else.

3635270,2,B001HN69CC,"The novel by which `The Time Traveler's Wife' is adapted is a lengthy one.  The film is barely over an hour and a half.  This is a problem.  The problem is that, with such a uniquely engaging prose, `The Time Traveler's Wife' needed that extra time to develop its characters and their relationships in order for us, the audience, to care.  When all was said and done, I simply didn't care enough.

The film tells the story of Henry, a man who has a rare genetic disorder that causes him to time travel without warning.  He can't control it, and this causes him to disappear and reappear at different stages of his own life.  The film follows his love affair with Clare, a beautiful young woman who falls in love with Henry at the very moment she meets him, when she is only six years old.  She grows up fantasizing about him (or so we are told) and when she finally has him all to herself she realizes that she has to share him with his disease, waiting for him to reappear in her life at the `right' moments.  They love one another, but there are always strains to those affections.

Like I said, the concept here is rather engaging.  I actually LOVE the idea.  I have yet to read the novel, but I gather that it is very good and I am intrigued to read it since if the concept is done justice (and given room to develop) then it should prove itself marvelously entertaining.  But that is the main root of this film's problems.  Some ideas and or stories are not suited for the big-screen.  You simply cannot establish in an hour and half the kind of love needed to sustain this film.  The script is lazy and clichd instead of rich and meaningful.  The editing is a problem for it leaves much to be desired, giving us scenarios that don't quite finish themselves.  We are always waiting for the film to come to life.  The dialog becomes stilted; the performances become generalizations as apposed to real, living, breathing people.

This film needed to be something more epic in scope.  It becomes hollow because of lack of depth and structure.  While it is, at times, beautiful and even haunting visually, the impact of this film wares off very quickly.

Personally I think this film would have been better suited as a mini-series.  Forget the time restraints of a motion picture (although some films transcend those restraints by pushing the envelope), give me six weeks of two-hour segments.  That will flesh out this story.  That will make Henry and Clare real to the viewer.  That will prove their love and cause us to fall head over heals for them as well.  This film just fails to deliver any emotional relevancy, and because of that it fails; period.",1279584000,4,2658,4.50418410041841
3635271,4,B001HN69CC,"After reading Roger Ebert's review which skewered ""The Time Traveler's Wife"", I was reluctant to watch the film, but I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did, it was much better than anticipated.  I haven't read the book, which probably worked to my advantage in enjoying the film - I didn't have any preconceived notions on what the film should be about.

The movie is a good old-fashioned romance.  The actual time-traveling isn't treated in any depth whatsoever, except to acknowledge that the time traveler has no control over when he travel through time, he's learned to cope with it (mostly), and his clothes are unable to travel with him, so he always arrives naked (which is one of the main challenges of his time travel, he's constantly breaking into places and stealing clothes).  Somewhat surprisingly, everyone in his life that he trusts accepts his time travel as just a ""condition"" (which is what he calls his ability to time travel).

His wife is the most understanding of everyone, she just accepts the fact that sometimes, her husband will just disappear, then come back a few weeks later like nothing happened.

I think the time-traveling is actually a metaphor for marriage.  Sometimes, spouses just up and leave without warning.  Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't. And sometimes, people can be there physically, but emotionally, they are far away and in another time (they are ""distant"").

The Time Traveler's Wife is a very satisfying movie, and it makes a great ""date movie"".  I saw this with my wife, and she enjoyed it as much as I did (let's face it, the movie was made for women, not so much for guys). Big thumbs up.",1279497600,,1662,4.7595818815331015

People about to make a purchase have the right to know what to expect from an item, especially when they're about to buy something with a very inconvenient and irritating feature that is unadvertised in the product description.

I'm giving this DVD one star because of the large number of trailers at the beginning that you can't skip. Playing the disc completely disables the fast-forward, skip, menu and stop buttons. This happened in my Mac and in my expensive new DVD player. It's about fifteen or twenty minutes of advertisements for other movies. This is unacceptable. Unskippable previews are never okay, but to have this many of them is ridiculous.

I would have bought this DVD if not for this foolishness. I'm glad I only rented it.",1277942400,7,1177,4.649038461538462
3635374,2,B001HN69CC,"I guess I am surprised by good reviews but I am always at odds with general population.
 Let's just say I expected something a bit interesting. The gist of the story is that main character has a genetic defect that allows him to travel in time(kind of like magic, I guess). The entire movie consists of him going and coming back from his travels. It never explained how or why he is able to do that. Poor girl that he falls in love with spends her time waiting for him to come back from his ""travel"" and then they get a daughter who is ..whoops, a ""time traveler"" also. That's the whole movie for you. I love Sci-fi but this is a pretty poor attempt(and a boring one at that). There is a love story in there but frankly I couldn't have cared less. I found all the characters rather annoying and superficial. I think if you like movies that don't explain anything and don't go anywhere, this one is for you.

3635377,4,B001HN69CC,"All many of us do is occupy space but sometimes its special because of the space we occupy in someone's life. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" based on the popular novel focuses Henry (Eric Bana) a man permanently unstuck in time--he's born with a genetic defect that causes him to move through time unpredictably. That makes life a problem when it comes to holding a job or falling in love. Early on though he meets Clarie (Rachel McAdams)as a child in a field near her family's home. It seems that while Henry may randomly pass through time he at least goes to places that are somehow important to him acting like gravity's pull giving him a tether regardless of whether he's in the past, present or future. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" tells the story of their difficult love affair, marriage and life.

We all often can feel like we drop in and out of our own lives but Henry doesn't have a choice because he can't control his condition. Luckily, he finds someone who can provide him with unconditional love even as he faces hiccups and disagreements with his wife over having a child (that might possibly inherit the defect)or even having a life together.

MAJOR SPOILER PARAGRAPH:

Directed by Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan""), ""Wife"" begins to fall apart when it isn't consistent to it's own internal logic (how can he travel outside of his own lifetime during the two incidents that he witnesses? The only reason I can surmise is that his daughter who DOES learn to control her ability to move randomly through time somehow wills him to appear outside of his own life (since the two times he moves forward outside his own lifetime are moments exhibit some unusual characteristics it's the only possibility aside from dramatic license that I can think of). Those two points to stretch the film's own internal logic and rules that it establishes but if you're willing to overlook these two missteps you'll enjoy ""The Time Traveler's Wife"".

END OF SPOILER PARAGRAPH:

Director Schewntke does a good job of creating a warm and comfortable atmosphere for the two unlikely lovers in the film and the screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"", ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Last Mimsy"")manages to include the important events/moments from the original novel and stay relatively true to Audrey Niffenegger characters. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a delightful, moving and touching story that will resonante with you. Is it perfectly told or logical? Nope but go with it and you'll enjoy it.

Extras include a 25 minute featurette is included as an extra although it's a bit disappointing that we don't get a commentary track on the making. We also get a featurette on the difficulty of adaptating the novel to film.

The Blu-ray looks extremely good with nice detail and color reproduction.",1273708800,,2777,4.870762711864407

3635379,3,B001HN69CC,"Well, I messed up.  I watched The Time Traveler's Wife last night before reading the book.  Guess it seemed fitting since I did a bit of time travel myself for work last week...flying to Detroit and working in Ohio which is an hour ahead of us, and then flying back.

At first, I was a bit confused.  It was like walking in on a movie and everyone else but me knows what has happened.  But I watched right from the beginning, so the actors on the screen knew what was happening and it was left up to the audience to just figure it out.  And I think I eventually did.

I admit I was utterly confused when Henry (the time traveler) would go back in time and visit his wife-to-be when she was a little girl.  Had he actually done it when in her world that time was the present?  If so, did she remember?  Most of the time it seemed she did so it had actually happened.  The movie begins with a scene where she's caught up to the present time in his own life and he doesn't know who she is or that they are going to marry, but she knows.  But if he'd been visiting her when she was a little girl, shouldn't he know too?

Then there are the scenes where he goes in the future and meets his little girl when she is ten, but in his current life she hasn't been born yet, and later is only a baby.  I was a bit intrigued by this and admit it made more sense to me than the earlier travel scenes with the wife.

We're not really treated to a reason for Henry's time travel disorder.  He doesn't even know why it happens.  And most of the time we don't know where he's gone.  At one point, he's gone for two weeks.  On his wedding night, he's gone two or three times but seems to have returned each time.  It was almost as if time stood still....or it was a really long honey moon!  Besides the scenes where he's visiting his wife in her past, we also don't know where he goes or why.  But we're not really supposed to know.  The theme is based on the turmoil the traveling causes his wife and how she copes with it.

I didn't like this movie though I wanted to.  I can appreciate it, but it's not something I'd probably recommend to a friend or would want to see again.  Yes, I cried in the end, but not because of the way the movie ended.  It was because of the way it made me feel and my own inability to travel back in time and see what I've missed.  We will never be younger than we are right now at this moment.  And we can't change that.  Henry couldn't even change the past in the movie though he tried. And I'm sure I'm not the only one to feel this way.

I do appreciate the fact that the movie didn't try to make this out to be magical or any type of fantasy.  Despite the scenes where Henry fades into thin air like the invisible man, leaving behind a pile of clothes.  Or the scenes where he was in the same place twice because he'd gone into the future at some point and then the future became the present but he was already there.  It was all just matter-of-fact, like it was a pretty common thing that could happen to anyone.

So yet another book that was probably better than the movie!  I'm sorry Audrey Niffenegger.  I'm sure your book was beautiful and I probably would have enjoyed it more.  But I'm not going to read it.  I do have Her Fearful Symmetry over there on the shelf though.  Dare I wait for the movie? Probably not.  I owe Audrey that. But...

3635381,5,B001HN69CC,"Was thoroughly impressed with both the story line and the execution of this emotional roller coaster. I love time travel stories and this one goes in a different direction than any I've come across before. The production was excellent and the 'time travel effect' was unique. I will admit to being a bit concerned when that effect included the traveller showing up naked - I don't need obligatory nudity / soft porn in my movies. This however, was tastefully done and not offensive at all - more like a classical museum piece than the soft porn we are usually subjected to by the Hollywood crowd. [That being said, when we watched the 'Making of...' bonus section, it is mentioned that there was a moment in the book where the main character meets himself and has sex with himself - we won't be reading the book and I am grateful these types of scenes were not included in the movie - it would have fouled it completely for us].

Given where this movie COULD have gone and where it actually went, I have no hesitation in giving it 5 stars. Kudos to the writers and the director for portraying an amazing vision of time travel that could have been very uncomfortable to watch. If you were turned off by the book, but intrigued by the concepts, I highly recommend you forget what you may have found offensive in the book and enjoy the concept having been given a tasteful and sensitive treatment that portrays in a powerful way the essence of the story and concept without offending the sensibilities.",1272499200,,1499,4.593283582089552

3635383,2,B001HN69CC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  While the concept of 'The Time Traveler's Wife' appears pretty clever, the actual execution proves quite inept. Eric Bana is Henry DeTamble, a Chicago librarian, who has some kind of genetic mutation which causes him to skip around in time. The twist is that every time he jumps in time, he loses his clothes. You might think that the image of the naked Henry scrambling around for new duds as he appears in different eras might have the potential for some neat comic possibilities--but humorless director Robert Schwentke opts for a completely heavy-handed, serious approach.

  The way the time traveling works is that Henry is apparently drawn back to the significant events of his life. Chief among them is a car accident in which 6 year old Henry survives but his mother is killed. Henry still gets the opportunity to see his mother prior to her death as he time jumps into a pre-accident encounter on a train. Later, he visits his father who is now an alcoholic as he never got over his wife's death. The father knows about Henry's time traveling and berates him for not being able to prevent his mother's death. Henry states that he's been to the scene of the accident numerous times and despite his efforts, is never able to alter the events of what occurs (it's interesting that there are no scenes in which Henry does try and prevent his mother from being killed). Nonetheless, despite claiming that he's unable to change history, midway through the story, Henry jumps into the future where he buys a lottery ticket, providing a five million dollar windfall for he and his wife, and guaranteeing the family's financial security for the rest of their lives.

  One of the givens in this movie is to accept the absurd premise of a genetic mutation that can cause time travel. Since the story is a fantasy, it's a perfectly acceptable conceit. But even within the fantasy concept there has to be some kind of internal logic. It's posited that Henry has no control over his time-traveling forays. He supposedly never knows when he'll be leaving or returning to a particular place and point in time. What's more it's not one Henry who is traveling--there appear to be numerous incarnations of Henry (at different points in his life) who pop up all over the place. So how is it, that these different Henry's conveniently know when to pop back up a critical dramatic moment despite the fact that they supposedly have no control over their time hopping abilities? I'm thinking particularly about the wedding scene where the younger Henry disappears right before he's supposed to get hitched and then is replaced by the older, gray-haired Henry at the altar.

  In reading various postings on the internet regarding 'The Time Traveler's Wife', a fair number of people are disturbed by the scenes in which Henry visits his future wife, Clare, as a child. To them, the scenes are unsavory as there is perhaps an unhealthy relationship between a child and a grown man suggested. For me, there are no suggestions of an underlying sexual relationship between the characters. Fortunately, the filmmakers did not deal with the problem of the time traveling daughter--wouldn't she have also lost her clothes when hopping around in time? Now that would have been truly disturbing and I can see why the issue was not dealt with at all--despite adding to the entire implausibility of the plot.

  Speaking of the plot, there is little tension as the story moves along. Part of the problem is that Henry is such a non-heroic sort of character. One wonders how he can hold a job as a librarian with all his time hopping. And then we see that he's not very industrious at all when he takes the easy way out and purchases the lottery ticket (Clare also comes off badly as she goes against her gut instincts and agrees to keep the ticket and cash it in). Henry never develops as a character and we find out little about him. He's too busy losing his clothes and disappearing all the time. There's a bit of tension when Henry's best friend tells Clare not to marry him but then he disappears until the end of the movie. Also completely underdeveloped is Dr. Kendrick who potentially could have developed some kind of cure for Henry's predicament but never does.

  The central moment of the story occurs when Henry decides to get a vasectomy because he fears that his child might end up with the same genetic abnormality. Clare outwits him by having sex with a pre-vasectomy Henry and gives birth to Alba, who of course also is a time traveler. The dark moment occurs when Henry is shot by Clare's Republican hunter father who mistakes him for a deer out in the woods. But since there are still time hopping Henry's out there, he pays a visit to Clare and Alba after he dies and makes them feel better.

  The Time Traveler's Wife does have an intriguing premise and holds your interest to the end. Ultimately however, we don't care about these characters precisely because they are not fleshed out as real people. It's a film that failed at the box office as both critics and the public agreed that the fantasy plot had too many implausibilities and none of the characters proved at all compelling. No amount of crocodile tears and whining by the Time Traveler's Wife that her husband never spends enough time at home, can save this flick from devolving into what it is: a predictable soap opera.",1272067200,6,5425,4.7135306553911205

3635437,4,B001HN69CC,"I saw this movie 2 days after I finished reading the book. Going into this I knew that there would be many things that would be changed or left out due to the book being almost 600 pages and the movie was 107 minutes.  I had a realistic expectation about the movie - I have learned from past disappointments.

Henry DeTamble is played by Eric Bana and Clare Abshire is played by Rachel McAdams. Both actors looked a lot like what I pictured the characters to look like in my head. I also think that they had amazing chemistry together. I also LOVED the little girl that played Clare (age 6) when she first meets Henry - she was great.

My feelings for this moving are slightly above average - the parts that were included from the book were done very well. They stuck pretty close to the events of the book but left out a lot - which made my boyfriend, who hasn't read the book, ask a lot of questions about the plot holes. I think if you had read the book before seeing the movie it would be easier to follow what was happening. I had been wondering how they would show Henry evaporating from one time and appearing in another - I think they did an AWESOME job at this - some amazing CG.  Beautifully rendered.

For anyone who has read the book - the ending is not the same. It evokes similar emotion - and those who have not read the book, have told me they loved the ending. I was a little disappointed because I loved the book ending.

Overall, I would give this 3.5/4 stars. I would still watch it again!",1271721600,51,1509,4.222222222222222

With a good actress like Rachel McAdams it was easy to allow this topic to pass, a drink might even help, but the annoying cheesiness was difficult for me. The other facts you should know about time travelers are: they are romantic, have money to buy a wedding ring even though they can't keep a job, and most importantly; they lose their clothes when they move in time so they have to stay in shape!

You can swallow large doses of anti reality drugs but still can't miss the lameness and emptiness of this movie's pointless need to create some romance, what a waste of time!",1271462400,3,741,4.323741007194244

For example, Star Wars is not really purely sci-fi, but a blend of sci-fi, western, adventure, and drama.  Likewise, the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are a blend of fantasy, action, romance, suspense and comedy.  This is also the case with The Time Traveler's Wife.  Part romance, part drama and part suspense, and overlaid on a fantasy context; this is another great movie based on a book.  The plot is simple enough; Eric Bana plays Henry, a man who inadvertently travels thru time without any control over when he travels, though its always to a time and place that is great emotional importance to him.  The suspense part of the movie deals with his death.  Thru his travels, he befriends and then falls in love with Clare, played by Rachel McAdams.  The story then is how they deal his travels, and the family they form.

3635535,3,B001HN69CC,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is your typical tear-jerker romance.  Think about every Nicholas Sparks adaption you've ever seen or any movie where one of the main characters has a chronic, life-threatening disease.  Because essentially, that's what this movie is: the ins and outs of a relationship in which one partner is afflicted with a devasting illness.

Henry, played by Eric Bana, is a special collections librarian who has a unique and devasting illness: he randomly travels through time.  He has no control about when or where it happens, or when or where he ends up.  Clare, played by Rachel McAdams, is the girl that the future Henry has been visiting since Clare was a little girl.  When Clare and Henry finally meet in Henry's present (they've previously met in Clare's past and Henry's future), they begin a typical Hollywood romance complete with tossed sheets and fights that involve one or both parties storming out, only to be brought back togther to make up within five minutes.

That said, without the time traveling, this is yet another Hollywood weepy-romance.  The only shock is seeing Eric Bana naked from behind when he pops into the past/present/future.  And like every other Hollywood weepy-romance, it is entertaining enough for you to see it once, but not necessarily something you feel compelled to view repeatedly.

3635575,1,B001HN69CC,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" was directed by Robert Schwentke and the screenplay was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and the novel by Audrey Niffenegger. It stars Eric Bana as Henry, a man with a genetic disorder that makes him unable to stay in one place in time and so he time travels. Rachel McAdams plays his eventual wife, Clare.

I found the premise of the book interesting and exciting seeing him pop around in time, never knowing what was going to happen next. But just as awkward as it was in the book, I have a little trouble with him showing up naked places, particularly in front of the 6 year old version of Clare. That being said, I think this script was well adapted and well ordered from the book. Starting with him as a child and covering the most important events in Henry's life made the movie easy to watch and understand, even for someone who hasn't read the book I would think. It never stops you from wondering though, how happy this couple ever truly is. Their lives are plotted out in advance seemingly without choice and one of the main conflicts is that she is always having to sit around and wait for him to come back and can't predict when he will. I think the ending of the movie is better than the ending of the book. If your friend or girlfriend really likes romantic dramas, then they will eat this up. But for me, it has to be something pretty special or I lose patience with it.

Eric Bana is always hit or miss for me. Liked him in ""Troy"", didn't like him in ""The Incredible Hulk"". I thought he did well enough in ""Funny People"" and ""Star Trek"", but I'm not a huge fan of ""Munich"". For this movie, he was so busy disappearing and reappearing that when he had scenes with his co-star, I didn't feel like he was THERE connecting with her very well.

Poor Rachel McAdams, first ""The Notebook"" and all that drama and now this, even more heartbreak. Do we as film viewers just like seeing her in romantic turmoil? She's very talented, but give the girl a break! I hope she got a good paycheck here. She's very beautiful and has a great smile and I have to admit, when her eyes well up with tears, she almost gets me. But their relationship together was never sold for me, not in the book and not on screen with these two actors.

Bana and the Girls spend endless hours staring into each others eyes; everyone says ""I love you"" ALL THE TIME; there is no conflict, just Bana constantly re-explaining why he pops in and out of different times, while the people around him make the most obvious and banal (no pun intended) comments about his inconsitent appearance and behaviour; it's called the time traveller's WIFE, but we spend most of our time folowing HIM around.

The opportunities for something smart and romantic are all over the place -- all deftly ignored in favour of the most trite eighties MOW product.  In the hands of Charlie Kaufman (or even Donald Kaufman) this might have been a minor masterpiece (at least on par with Benjamin Button), but now it is just a major mediocrity -- something to put on the shelf next to ""Wicker Park"".

Obviously it's supposed to be a love story of sorts, but it has such a different background with the time travel premise that it offers something a little different which makes for an interesting viewing experience. As many have pointed out, the time travel aspect is very implausible and not very well explained. You just have to sort of accept it as a premise for the film. The movie begins with great romantic enthusiasm which eventually goes through periods of great frustration and ends with feelings of reluctant acceptance. There were two things that made the movie less than five stars for me. First of all, I think the time travel aspect was quite underdeveloped both in the explanation of it and in the episodes themselves. They seem to happen quickly without much development of what happens during them. Second, I think a number of possibilities go undeveloped such as the potential of changing the future. This is the type of movie in which you expect the happy ending to involve everyone being together in the end through some twist, but it doesn't quite work out that way.

3635694,3,B001HN69CC,"Though it has a storyline of a time-traveling theme, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" should best be enjoyed as romantic fantasy. Based on the novel of Audrey Niffenegger, and adapted by Bruce Joel Rubin, Oscar-winning writer of ""Ghost,"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a romance slightly reminiscent of ""Somewhere in Time,"" where familiar sci-fi element serves as backdrop to the film's bitter-sweet romance.

The film follows a charming but strange love story between Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and Claire Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Henry is a Chicago librarian and also is the titular ""time traveler."" One day Henry meets Claire. She says to Henry, who looks puzzled, she has known him since she was a little girl. Their complicated love story defies easy summary. In short, they fall in love with each other, but Henry's involuntary time traveling, without which they might not have met each other, can also be a great obstacle in their relationship.

For his time traveling is pretty unique and even troublesome. For example, Henry has to be transported back and forth through time, naked. (This turns out a very important part of the story.)

""The Time Traveler's Wife"" could have been a much more moving romance. It has beautiful photography and fine performances from the supporting actors Arliss Howard and Ron Livingston. What the film needs is a better director who understands some simple rules of romance: characters. Despite the considerable chemistry between the leads, the two main characters do not come off as interesting as they should be. The concept of Henry's time traveling is original and unique, but the confusing storytelling of director Robert Schwentke (""Flightplan"") lacks the emotional depth, preventing us from relating to the characters we really don't know much about.

The potential for good romance is always there, buried in the weak script. In the last 30 minutes ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" finally picks up, as we know where their romance is going to. That is when I really started to care, and I really liked the conclusion, though this may not be exactly what you want.",1267056000,,2100,5.078260869565217

This movie sucked. I'm sorry to say so, because I'm a big fan of Rachel McAdams - ""The Notebook"" was amazing, and I hoped that this one would prove equally heart-warming.

The first problem is the premise. Henry is a time-traveler; it's a compulsion he has no control over. He pops in and out, always naked, always in search of clothes - for no real reason. Regardless, McAdams' character falls in love with him (after first meeting him as a child) and marries him.

When things get tough, Henry buys a lotto ticket and wins millions. They buy a new house, with a studio so his wife can work on her art. She miscarries several times, evidently because the babies are travelers, too. Henry gets a vasectomy, but it doesn't matter because his YOUNGER time-traveling self sleeps with his wife and she becomes pregnant.

They end up having a daughter, who's also a traveler (of course). I would try to explain further, but I just can't get excited about writing this review. This movie was a disappointment. I recommend renting instead of buying, if you still want to see it. Don't waste your money.",1266451200,4,1106,4.656410256410257

Now, I am huge Sci-Fi guy and recognize the implications of time travel and own many such DVD's displaying the theme in many unique ways, for example, of course Star Trek episodes and movies, but the original Time Machine, and yes - Back to the Future, but there's Millennium as well, and the Terminator Series, and Somewhere in Time, and The Land That Time Forgot (in a sense), and many many others.

However, this one broke a few rules, for example talking with oneself in the present when meeting between two time periods, but overall, it was enjoyable and thought-provoking.

I did not read the book, but I hope the doctor's role was more important there. My husband, teenaged son and I watched this last night.  My husband joked ""is anything going to blow up?""

3635741,3,B001HN69CC,"THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is a diversion.  At times what works well in a novel doesn't translate to the screen: the magic of the reader's imagination can be more powerful than the visualization of a screenwriter and director. Such is the case of Audrey Niffenegger's novel - an escape into a world of the unknown (time traveling) that played well on the page largely due to the writing skill of the author. Bruce Joel Rubin's screenplay makes a mighty attempt to make visual the imaginary magic of the novel and thanks to CGI it pulls off the rather strange effects of appearing and disappearing of a time traveler.  Robert Schwentke directs with a hefty dose of saccharine though, making what could have been a delicate story somewhat lugubrious.

Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has the genetic code that allows him to travel backward and forward in time - a trait that requires a certain degree of acceptance on the part of the audience. We see Henry as a child, as a young man who meets a girl who will on a different 'trip' be a woman Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), and witness a bizarre courtship between a couple whose match seems made in heaven....  Along the way Clare's friends (Jane McLean as Charisse and Ron Livingston as a vastly different Gomez than in the novel) figure into the quasi-normal relationship/marriage that takes place.  The tale can be confusing if the viewer is not willing to enter the realm of 'possible' and the main guide of the film seems to focus on the fact that whenever Henry time travels, he ends up in his new destination naked (there are many scenes of Eric Bana just searching for clothes).  Of course the film can't have a logical ending, but the ending selected, corny though it is, fits the story.  Lots of sugar to swallow here, but if you're in a Valentine mood it is a pleasant diversion.  Grady Harp, February 10",1265846400,25,1857,4.640243902439025

And what started the whole thing...Claire and Henry meeting in some present, and then Henry going back because he had already met Claire?...not stuff for fifteen year old boys.  But for the forty something moms, a perfect escape movie with pretty people, an intensely romantic premise, and just enough weepiness to make it real (even though it couldn't possibly be real).",1265673600,4,953,4.642857142857143
3635796,4,B001HN69CC,I re-read the book many times and obviously am enthralled with it. I trust the film to be as well done. I know that there are some elements that can't appear on film due to time constraints and subplots that would only tangle the very big story as it is. One thing I have been thinking of since I have read and re-read is that this almost seems to be a metaphor for the life of many couples-absence from some aspects of a relationship-where women may be present and the man is out of phase-the longing the woman fells to have her man get a clue.

Normal you can look past problems in the plot but when the movie is so disjointed as this one the rules of the movie has to be fallowed. A man who knows the future and lives in the past will change it just from being there so when one of the rules is you can't change the future that is very hard to pull off, and they don't. So it is really frustrating to watch him change certain things and then act like he can't fix stuff when he gets a chance. I watched this on a flight and by the end I was just frustrated and ready to walk out. The funny thing was that all the people around me felt the same way. The best part of the movie was how fun it was to make fun of it for the last hour of the flight.

3635799,4,B001HN69CC,"I noticed that alot of people who've read the book that this movie is
based on really have negative things to say about it, but isn't that
always the case when it comes to Hollywood taking a well-liked literary
work and juicing it up for the entertainment masses? The book version
never translates well (in most cases) because the masses have short attention
spans, and are not going to sift through subtle symbolisms...they want
the story to get to the point and do it with flair! (-:

As for me, I really enjoyed this movie and it's mix of romance and sci-fi.
And I don't normally go in for gushy romantic-type films unless they're very
intelligently done with a minor helping of mush & gush, so there you go guys!
This movie is a very uniquely & intelligently done and also a well-acted story
and Eric Bana & Rachel McAdams gave brilliant performances in my opinion.
As for the mush & gush factor, I say it was well balanced within the context
of the story-telling and didn't make me dry heave like some of these type movies do!
In other words, the intimacy is very natural and not over-the-top.
This film runs the gamut of emotion and life experience and if doesn't touch
you on some level, then you need to check your soul, see a shrink, or
switch your meds, because you are stunted emotionally!
I think what throws alot of people off about this film is trying to
keep up with the time traveling aspect and how his younger self seems
to loop back over his older self and interact with his future self, etc.
Well if you think that's hard to keep up with, in the book, it was even
more intricate and confounding. (-:
Brad Pitt's production company, PLAN B, was the producer behind this
project and I heard he was actually considered for the Eric Bana role,
but he was working on ""Benjamin Button"" at the time.
It was very smart of the powers that be to release this film to DVD
during the Valentine's Day season, because it's perfect for that.

3635801,3,B001HN69CC,"The Time Travelers Wife begins and ends a perplexing misnomer, without any real insight or resolution.  A somewhat disjointed story, it's more about the time traveler than his wife.  I haven't read the book, but the film focuses more on the novelty of its unique circumstance than on the characters plight, forsaking the romance it's billed as for shallow sci-fi fiction, as if the uniqueness of circumstance were more important than the story being told, if there ever was one bigger than its base idea.  We really don't get to know the characters as well as is needed for the kind of connection that is most requisite of the genre.  Rather this story seems to levy it's budget on trying to attract a more masculine audience to the genre, as if men won't enjoy a romance any other way.  It is indeed a novel idea mixing time travel with the romance genre; and the added depth is intriguingly astute in application.  But the trade-off of characterization for the implausible, while fresh, still probably isn't going to be enough to appease male-centric audiences longing for more action in their entertainment.  While The Time Traveler's Wife isn't the best romance, despite semi-shallow character development and a lack of payoff, in that there's no real explanation and you have to virtually inject your own rhyme and reason, it still manages to prove moving in the end.",1264809600,2,1372,4.8626609442060085

3635854,4,B001HN69CC,"Let me just get this out of the way right up front. Eric Bana, the time traveler in THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, also played the time traveling Romulan in the latest Start Trek movie. It occurred to me that his biggest concern in both movies was ""What year is it?"" Poor guy. Let's hope he doesn't get type-cast.

THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE is an entertaining flick with good acting. I was afraid that it would be sappy, based on the title, or that the science fiction tenets of time travel would be horribly abused, but neither is true. They established their time travel rules and stuck to them. There was romance, but it wasn't a romance film masquerading as a sci-fi movie. I was very pleasantly surprised.

The problem is that I can't really tell you much about the story of THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE without giving chunks of it away. Let's just say that his life is not linear. He fades out uncontrollably, leaving his clothing behind, and reappears in random times and locations, naked. Madcap mayhem ensues - not. It is mostly a quiet, romantic film, with things unfolding as they need to. I struggle to tell you more, but I can't think of anything that wouldn't reveal a secret.

The acting is solid, the plot twists are amusing, sad, delightful, and romantic, and the overall concept is unique. I read a lot of Sci-Fi (as opposed to SyFy) and I liked this one a lot.  And, no, I have not read THIS book, but it definitely is going on my list.

I finally watched it a few days ago and I was very disappointed. I had incredibly high hopes for this movie. I thought it would be magical, filled with good drama and romance and fantastic story....

WOW! Was I wrong or what? I watched it with four other people and a little over halfway through the movie I fell asleep. I waited months for this folks.  Months and months to finally watch it on my pc and wow it was completely weak.

The main character, the time traveler. Now how many of you thought he was a big creapo aka pedophile? Some of the scenes in this movie was really weird and makes the main character look like some sort of child stalker. The movie's storyline was all over the place. I continuously got confused and then when I finally did get it, it was still weird. I hated the story and, though I like the actor in other films, in this one it was just horrible. They really made him seem like some sorta creepy stalker out for little girls.

So out of 4 of my friends, 2 of us thought it was plain horrific and the other two thought it was no better than ""ehhhh..""

As usual, I go straight for the complaints. The movie was lame and the character development was weak and the storyline had no ultimate purpose to it. This movie had no soul. Will never ever watch again.",1262476800,7,1454,4.2690909090909095

Unfortunately, the silliness at the heart of the novel was accentuated in the movie and I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Many movies fail to live up to their literary origins but this went a step further -- it made me like the book less than I had before seeing the film.

Things that I glossed over in the book -- the way the protagonist loses all his clothes whenever he time travels -- now seemed ludicrous. The creepy nature of the relationship between the two lovers who meet when he's a grown man and she's a little girl, was accentuated by seeing them together on the screen.

The film stays pretty true to the book except in its final scene, but the growing, brooding threat that hung over the latter pages of the book is absent here. There's something absurd about the way the actors solemnly go through the motions. One doesn't root for them because the whole situation seems too ridiculous to believe.",1261267200,4,1112,4.467980295566503

The story line was intersting, the characters were really well developed and you really care about them. The acting was excellent, and we found ourselves really pulled in throughout the entire movie.

Contrary to some of the reviews I read, this movie was easy to follow. I don't understand what the problem was. I had never read the book, yet it was completely clear what was going on. I don't get why anyone would have had a problem. Also, there was nothing strange or wrong about the traveller visiting the younger version of his love interest. It was very innocent. One reviewer's mention that there was no plausible explanation for the lead's time travel abilities doesn't make sense to me. There was a very sufficient and even detailed explanation given in the movie. Keep in mind that we're dealing with a fiction scifi story here, and it was plenty adequate. I found I was able to buy into the concept and really immerse myself, and ultimately I enjoyed the story very much.

This is a really fine movie, and I'd recommend that anyone who enjoys scifi, time travel or romance view this.",1253404800,103,1210,4.676056338028169
3635863,4,B001HN69CC,"In reviewing the Time Traveler's Wife, you have to address two types of viewers, people who have never read the book, and the passionate, opinionated fans who have read the bestselling novel that the movie is based on. If you have read the book, you definitely will be dissapointed in the movie. The book is so in depth and contains so many layers and different characters that it is impossible to include it all in one normal length movie. But on its own, the movie is pretty good.

I have read the book and found the movie quite enjoyable. Eric Bana is perfect as Henry DeTamble, the man suffering from chrono-displacement disorder which causes him to time travel on a whim. The beautiful Rachel McAdams is Clair Abshire, the woman destined to love Henry.

There is good chemistry between the pair as the film moves quickly to their marriage and the difficulties they face as they try to live a life when Henry may have knowledge about their future that could be painful. If you haven't read the book, this is a really good movie. I don't think the time travel elements are too confusing, and the movie is filled with great acting and emotional scenes (Alba, Henry and his mom.)

One thing the movie misses by skipping over so many parts is the true characterization of Henry and Claire. The movie never really gives us a picture of the two other than their lives revolving around Henry's condition. We don't learn about their careers, or how Henry developed a great relationship with Claire as a child and a teenager.

As with all novel adaptations, the film version leaves a lot out. But I enjoyed seeing this story told as a movie. While it has flaws, fans of the book and people looking for a good romance should enjoy it.",1252886400,3,1728,4.564516129032258
3635924,5,B001HN69CC,"""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" based on the best-seller novel by Audrey Niffenegger, is a beautifully realized, poignant romance that makes the viewer thing a lot about love, time, space, devotion, and many other lofty topics.

Eric Bana plays, Henry, a librarian who has a genetic disorder that causes him to randomly travel in time without any notice. He arrives and returns from his travels naked, and has no control over when he leaves and returns. His travels find him at various ages, reliving events like the death of his opera-singer mother in a car accident, or experiencing events for the first time, like getting to know a young girl name Clair. When he is in his late twenties, Clair, who is exactly twenty(played by Rachel McAdams),finds him. At this point, he doesn't know her, but she has known him since she was a little girl.

The rest of film details a relationship fraught with the unknown. Henry leaves and returns without any warning, takes a few close friend into his confidence regarding his secret, struggles to maintain a romance, then a marriage with Clair, and struggles to start a family and remain hopeful, knowing that the future is uncertain and likely to remain unstable.

Bana and McAdams are wonderful in the roles of Henry and Clair. This movie wouldn't work at all unless the characters were perfectly played, had chemistry, and were able to make you focus on the struggle of their relationship rather than the fantasy element of their problem. But the skill of the story is that time traveler ends up being such a perfect metaphor for the uncertainty and difficulties of romantic relationships.

This movie is wonderfully moving in ways that have to be experienced rather than described.",1252281600,15,1721,4.903780068728523
3635925,4,B001HN69CC,"A good adaptation of one of the best books of our time. This was a hard act to do and the movie did a rather faithful and strong capturing of the spirit of the book if not a play-by-play retelling of it. Having said that, it's also worth commending the filmmakers on the smoothness with which they handled the disappearance and reappearance of the main character and the CGI that was involved with him dissipating into thin air during his time travels. Eric Bana does justice to Henry, whereas Ron Livingston is perfectly cast in the role of Gomez, Henry's friend and Claire's ""protector"" (in the book Gomez is obsessed with Claire and wished to spend the rest of his life with her, whereas in the movie his relationship isn't as clearly defined - he is mostly a concerned friend). It's sad that this movie was shelved for so long and it's very reassuring to see it do well at the box office (so far the movie has grossed about $30 million domestically and the theater I went to tonight was sold out for the 8 pm showing - always a good sign for a film).

Disclamer: It's also worth noting that as a huge fan of the book, my opinion about this movie is rather skewed - I tend to fill in the gaps and care about the characters because the book had done a great job of developing the characters. The movie, however, hardly makes the characters relateable, and someone who sees the movie without having the book as the plot background, might find the Claire-Henry relationship a bit offputting.",1251158400,31,1491,4.481617647058823

3635927,4,B001HN69CC,"Based on a novel by Audrey Niffenegger, this sci-fi/romance/drama movie explores the problems a couple experiences when one of them (Henry, played excellently by Eric Bana) disappears without warning for varying periods of time, while Claire (the radiant Rachel McAdams) deals with life and waits for his return.

The thing is, not only is Henry gone, but he's also gone in time, and the Henry that returns may not be the same age as the Henry who left.  To compound it, he has no control over when or where he makes the jump, and his clothes don't make it, leading to many dangerous and embarrassing situations.

Short attention span summary (SASS):
1. Girl  meets boy she's known all her life for the very first time
2. He doesn't know her yet
3. Together they try to work it out

Although not exactly a chick-flick, this movie may appeal primarily to female audiences, and it would be a definite plus to read the novel first.  The chemistry between the lead characters is wonderful, and the ""disappearing"" special effect is rather cool.

I thought that the rather complex premise was handled very well, given the fairly short run time, and was impressed by the acting and direction.  Not for everybody, but certainly good by me.

3635928,1,B001HN69CC,If no stars were an option I would have chosen it that. This movie is awful. It is such a downer. I was leary of going after seeing the review in my local paper. ALWAYS go with your gut! What a waste of a date night!,1250294400,5,216,3.717391304347826
3635929,4,B001HN69CC,"While the story for ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is not at all interested in plausibility or logic, it is interested in making an emotional connection with the audience, and so it does. Make no mistake--this adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's novel is about as preposterous as it gets, telling the story of a man who can go back and forth through time but lacks the ability to control when he goes and for how long he'll be gone. There's no adequate explanation for his condition, and maybe it's for the best; this a love story, after all, not a supernatural commentary on evolution or expanded consciousness. Besides, if you were to stop for a moment and really think about the idea, the inevitable questions will eventually be so numerous that you'll end up with a headache. For this particular story, you'll be much better off just blindly buying into the premise.

Only then will it be possible to appreciate the more engaging aspects of the story, the most obvious being the romance between the time traveler, Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana), and his wife, Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams). Actually, it would be more accurate to say that sometimes she's his wife--it all depends at what point in time the movie shifts to, and there are many of them. They meet back when she was only six years old and playing alone on her family's vast meadow. From out of nowhere comes a man from the future without any clothes on, and after she gives him his blanket, he tells her that he will officially meet her years later, at which point she will be a college student in a library looking for an art book. You see, during that first encounter, he was older, nearly forty; in the library, he will be younger, say twenty-five or so.

Anyway, as time goes on for Clare, Henry will repeatedly come into and shift out of her life, and they will fall deeply in love and get married. Imagine what this must be like for Clare, never knowing when her husband will appear and disappear out of thin air like a ghost. One second, he's there carrying dishes to the table for dinner, and the next second he's gone, leaving Clare behind to sweep up broken pieces of ceramic. A marriage like this really gives new meaning to the vow, ""To have and to hold for all time.""

One of the unfortunate side effects of his time travelling is that none of his clothes travel with him, so wherever he goes (whenever, rather), he's forced to steal some by breaking into a store or someone else's home. And at what age will he be when he gets back? One of the film's more clever segments incorporates a fair amount of humor and takes place on their wedding day; a younger version of Henry is getting ready for the ceremony, only to disappear in the bathroom. Fortunately, an older version of Henry arrives just in time, albeit with graying hair. This man disappears after the ceremony, right as Clare's father (Philip Craig) invites them to the dance floor. Fortunately, that's when the younger Henry returns, and even though he was technically there, he apologizes for missing the wedding.

I told you this time travel gimmick was better left unquestioned. Attached to it, however, are emotional issues that are genuinely touching, and this definitely includes Henry and Clare's attempts to have a baby. I will refrain from going into detail here, but here are some questions to think about. Is it reasonable to assume that Henry's condition can be passed along to his child? If so, then is it fair for that child to even be born? There comes a point when he seeks the help of David Kendrick (Steven Tobolowsky), a geneticist, and while the results of his various tests do little to shed light on why Henry is the way he is, he does play a pivotal role in helping him and Clare conceive. Henry, by the way, tells Dr. Kendrick that his condition is known as chronoimpairment, a term Kendrick has not yet coined.

One other emotional issue that serves the story well is the broken relationship between Henry and his father, Richard (Arliss Howard), who hasn't been himself since his wife's untimely death. Henry was only six at the time, but as a time traveler, he continuously goes back to the days before her death and holds brief conversations with her as a stranger. This naturally begs the question of why he can't simply prevent her from dying. This itself begs the question of why, ""I've tried, but there's nothing I can do,"" is the best explanation he has.

Deep human drama runs through this movie, and that's what I found the most compelling. Henry's ability to time travel, however, is conveniently left unexplained. We're only meant to pay attention to the relationship between Henry and Clare, and indeed, we do. The concept is inherently absurd, but the chemistry between the main characters is not; we able to see them up on screen and actually believe that they're in love. That's what's so fascinating about ""The Time Traveler's Wife"": It's an absorbing drama based on a premise that's impossible to take seriously. How did it achieve this? Much like Henry's condition, it's probably better to not question it and just accept it for what it is.",1250208000,105,5117,4.661129568106312
3635930,1,B001HN69CC,"I will preface this review by stating that ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" by Audrey Niffenegger is my favorite book of all time. Coming from someone who reads an average of 60 books per year, that's saying a lot.

I eagerly awaited the release of this film for years. Also, I tried to approach the film adaptation with an open mind. Even though the trailer looked very good, I knew that the movie would never be as good as the book, at least not with my ridiculously high expectations. I did hope, however, that the film would take the most touching moments of Clare and Henry's amazing story and turn it into a tender, romantic film. Unfortunately, everything about this movie failed miserably. It is a complete disaster, and I think that goes for fans of the book as well as for people who aren't familiar with the story.

The plot revolves around the relationship between Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) and Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams), which is a bit unorthodox, to say the least. Henry is a time traveler, which means he has the nasty habit of up and disappearing at any time, with no notice and through no fault of his own. He journeys into the future and back in time, which is how he and Clare first meet when she is six and Henry is in his 30's. Theirs is a love story that spans multiple decades and dimensions. Together, Clare and Henry experience deep passion, bitter disappointment, and heartbreaking tragedy, but through it all, their love for each other manages to carry them through.

I won't spoil more of the plot for those of you that haven't read the book. I also won't waste a lot of time complaining about all the random things that were changed from the book for no apparent reason. (Lincoln Park Zoo instead of the Art Institute? Temporarily wheelchair-bound instead of amputee? And why isn't Clare's hair red as an adult, for god's sake?! Her hair is such a huge part of the book! But I digress.) However, as an adaptation of a great novel and as a stand-alone romantic drama, this movie fails miserably.

First, from the perspective of a fan of the book, I hated the film's screenplay. I knew within the first five minutes that the movie was going to be a disaster. The film attempted to explain Henry's condition in the first three minutes, and that set the tone for everything else. Events happened at an insanely fast pace, never allowing the audience to grasp the full extent of what was happening. Obviously, whenever a book is adapted for the big screen, a lot of material needs to be cut. However, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" clocks in at roughly two hours, so there was definitely room to include some pertinent info that was severely lacking from the movie. I especially thought the scenes that revealed Henry's ultimate fate occurred much too quickly, and often the most tragic events in the characters' lives seemed to be sugarcoated...especially that ridiculous, watered-down ending! It also bothered me that the film made it seem like Clare and Henry spent most of the early years of their marriage fighting, because that wasn't the case at all.

Additionally, it was impossible to feel any sort of emotional connection to the characters on screen. I am actually fans of both Bana and McAdams, and I didn't care for either of their performances in this film. I'm not sure that's entirely the fault of the actors, though, considering that they were working with such an awful script.

My husband watched this movie with me, and he has not read the book. His overall impression of the film is that it was incredibly depressing (which is hilarious to me, because the book is so much darker, but better!). He also had a hard time keeping up with what was going on in the movie because everything happened so quickly and numerous important details were glossed over or very poorly explained.

I really thought this film would be able to capture at least some of the beauty and magic of Niffenegger's novel, but it didn't. What a terrible disappointment.",1250208000,43,3980,4.677142857142857
3635931,5,B001HN69CC,"I rushed out to see this movie, pretty much for Eric Bana, but I found myself swept away by the beauty of the entire film.

While some in the audience sobbed, I left with a silly grin that I don't think I'll be able to get off my face for quite some time.",1250208000,8,438,3.9886363636363638
3635932,3,B001HN69CC,"Hey, its not as if I don't enjoy seeing a good-looking man in the buff, especially when he's as boyishly attractive as Eric Bana.  However, in Robert Schwentke's adaptation of Audrey Niffenegger's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Time-Traveler-s-Wife/dp/015602943X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>,""  even this incredible hun(l)k (all bashful and more than a little angst-ridden ) cannot make this combination romance, sci-fi melodrama work without a sense of prevailing doom and a bit of creepy undertones that are more than strange with regard to adult Bana and his relationship to the child that becomes his wife.  But then again, I had a problem with this when I read the book and I confess to a confusion over the bestseller's popularity--at the time it had been one of those Morning Show recommendations.

While there are some similarities in tone to the equally somber Pitt/Blanchette vehicle, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Curious-Case-of-Benjamin-Button-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B001U0HBPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Single-Disc Edition)</a>,"" at least `Button' forces you to explore the theme of love and dependency--dependency as a child for its mother, as a mature adult desiring affection and then as an elderly person at the end of his/her life needing the love and support of those who love him/her.  Not so with `Traveler.'  Sadly, other than the exploration of the idea that in our universe time and space really do not exist and that perhaps we are able in some way to slip back and forth to various time slots within our lifetime--be it through memory, imagination or on a molecular level--""The Time-Traveler's Wife"" serves no function for me other than to depict the entrapment of love--for surely Clare (Rachel McAdams) from the moment she meets the ill-fated Henry (Bana) is snared as surely as the deer that wanders the woods on her family estate--just waiting for that decisive moment when an arrow or bullet will find its heart.

Let me clarify.  Henry has some rare genetic disease that causes him to zip around the space-time continuum in an uncontrollable way that would have baffled an already bemused Einstein.  Not that Einstein would not have laughed or at the very least shook his head to see buff and buffed Bana lurking around meadows, train stations and the like sans clothing (as fabric does not slip through whatever unknown wormhole Henry uses as his time tunnel/portal.)  Claire's life serves as the standard for chronology--she first meets Henry when he materializes behind a clump of bushes in the meadow by her home when she is around seven years old.  However, Henry does not actually meet Claire until he is a librarian and she a student that requires his assistance in finding a book.  Already Claire wins the prize for Miss or Ms Dependence--hooked at such a young age--and collapsing every other probability curve out there while she waits for the Time Traveler to enter her life--or re-enter her life at a point in time when pedophilia would not be an issue.

That's not to suggest that there is any of that sort of stuff going on.  Not at all.  Henry's atoms supposedly are attracted to certain locales no matter what the time slot and so, he frequently pops back and forth to places that hold special significance for him.  Claire, no matter her youth or her age, draws him like a magnet.  Nonetheless, a naked man hiding in the bushes while a young girl picnics in a field could presumably raise a few eyebrows.  Obviously, Claire's parents did not teach her not to talk to strangers even though she was born in cautious 1972.  Go figure.  Any other child would have run screaming on the wings of an eagle.  Not our Claire.

Bana plays Henry well as a sorrowful boy/man with the frustrated angst of someone with a dark cloud hanging over his head.  McAdams, while undeniably pretty--all big eyes and Madonna (not the rock star) forehead does not generate enough gravitas for me as the besotted, concerned and dependent Claire.  Blanchette in `Button' would have been better in this role of doomed from the start--she exudes maturity that Claire would have needed.  McAdams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Notebook-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000683VI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Notebook (New Line Platinum Series)</a>as vulnerable child/woman works well initially--but her older Claire doesn't quite register with any depth and as a mother to Alba--the couple's time-traveling child--she seems more an older distraught sister.

Bottom line:  ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" combines science-fiction, romance and melodrama in a two-hour slot that for this reviewer captured the feel of the book with all its somber overtones of the generic woman having to deal with the absence of her man in a world designed to accommodate only him.  Add insult to injury and imagine a man that cannot control when he's bouncing out of town and leaving his wife with all the responsibilities and not even leaving a contact number.  The naked Bana popping randomly around to glimpse the prepubescent and precocious young Claire may be a bit strange, but then again, the whole premise of the film has little meaning other than to suggest that wrapping around one person so intensely will only bring misery and a wistfulness that cannot be accommodated with anything real for long periods of time.  Parents take note that there is some blood in the scenes where Claire miscarriages and that Bana and McAdams both reveal some posterior cheekiness that although lovely and blemish free may offend.  Recommended if you loved the book.  I did not.

Postscript: In retrospect, this whole concept of the time-traveler flitting in and out of the events that encompass his life and go beyond his lifespan would make an interesting television series.  The romance between the husband and wife would be both romantic and poignant and like all good episodic shows there could be a one hour resolution to that week's story while the larger story of Henry searching for something that will allow him to control his disappearances would keep the momentum going.  Think ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001AZIRZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series</a>"" where Vincent and Catherine shared a doomed love and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk-Three-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001DHXT2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk (Three-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;where the search for a solution to being green is paramount.  Now if any television writer out there uses this idea--I want my percentage.

3635933,5,B001HN69CC,"I have to say The Time Traveler's Wife is one of the best love story movies I have seen. This movie starts with Henry as a child who learns in a way that he can travel in time. the catch? He never knows when it's going to happen or where he will wind up at. Henry (is played by Eric Bana who does a very good job) works in a liberary when a woman softly says his name and he has no idea of who she is. her name is Clare. Clare (is played by Rachel McAdams who is also very good)knows who he is and what he does and she asks henry to dinner to explaine. clare is the one person who understands him and he allows her into his heart. with that said, it was a great movie and I will be getting when it comes out on dvd.",1250208000,,715,3.7417218543046356
