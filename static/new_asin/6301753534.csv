369037,5,6301753534,Our 15 month old son Matthew is just in awe at this video!!  We are big WDW fans and we enjoy it just as much as he does!  He will actually sit down for 30 minutes to watch the entire video.  Often times he will get up and clap his hands and dance with the characters.  This is a must have!!!,982972800,,292,3.737704918032787

369180,5,6301753534,"This is what you want in a Disney Sing-along. I used to watch these as a kid and I recently discovered them on Youtube. I decided I wanted to 1. Own them for my own nostalgic need (my parents refused to buy them as kids- so now I get to buy them for cheap. Jokes on them), and 2. I wanted to share them with my God Children. They love it, I loved it- good times all around. It has Disney songs, and new songs. Yea, it's kind of dated, but it's not so much it's distracting. Rodger Rabbit is a little odd to have as a character....but he doesn't distract.

Bonus! If you switch to the French voice- it shows Disneyland Paris! Granted it's in French...but a neat hidden gem :)",1506988800,3,674,4.106060606060606

369254,5,6301753534,"Flash back to the early 90's!!  My siblings and I watched this sing along on VHS throughout our childhoods.  Now my 9 month old LOVES it!  She watches it at least twice a day.  We were watching it on youtube, but I figured having a hard copy would be good.  I don't find the songs annoying (probably because I grew up with them).  They are all Disney songs from classic movies.  It's always fun to watch before a trip to Disneyland!  It's fun, and the songs are catchy.  It encourages little kids to get up and dance and sing along.  We just love it!",1497916800,2,550,4.201923076923077
369255,3,6301753534,"So, this sing-a-long is from the 90's (which I knew before purchasing) and there is a grinning ghosts segment that can be pretty scary for little kids, but it arrived exactly as desciribed.

369257,5,6301753534,"When my oldest daughter was 1 year old, I purchased Happy Hauntings around Halloween to get her in the spirit. It quickly became a favorite, and she watched it year round. I had no idea there were other Disney Singalongs out there, as I was in my teens when the VHS videos came out. I recently became a new mom again and found Disneyland Fun while browsing Amazon. My twins (now 11 months old) LOVE it, and my older daughter enjoys watching it with them. Sure, it was filmed before their time...but who cares? They love the songs and the characters. We are a Disney loving family, so it is perfect for when we want to see our home away from home. My kids love Small World, Grim Grinning Ghosts, and Rumbly in my Tumbly the most. It keeps their attention and my babies dance to all the songs, even the opening sequence!",1495843200,,818,4.352941176470588

369609,5,6301753534,"This is a classic Disney sing-along!  A must-have for any Disneyland fan.

It starts off with Disney characters getting the park ready for opening... all while singing Whistle While You Work, of course. You then follow a group of kids, accompanied by the characters, as they go on the attractions throughout the park.

From the park's daily opening ceremony/""ribbon cutting""; to the busy walk down Main St.; to riding the Jungle Cruise, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, The Mark Twain Riverboat, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, teacups, Autopia, the now-removed Skyway and old version of StarTours; to having Disney lunch treats; to watching the Parade; to watching the fireworks; this movie has it ALL, and it captures the magic of each land perfectly.
Another great thingn about it is even though it looks like it's set in the 90s (mostly due to attire, haha, but also few rides that no longer exist), the attractions, the joy, and the magic of Disneyland will always be the same.  Therefore, this movie it will never be outdated.

This DVD is exactly as I remember the VHS being...actually, it's even better because it comes in English and French.
For the French, I was expecting it to be just like the English version but dubbed... I was wrong! The English version takes place at Disneyland and the French version takes place at Disneyland Paris (with the same songs, but also other songs that aren't in the English version)!  So it's almost like two movies in one ;).

I don't know why every single rating on here is not 5/5 stars.
It's lively and fun for kids to watch or dance to.
Even now, as an adult, I get so excited whenever I see and hear parts of this sing-along playing at the Frontierland shop at Disneyland.

It's pretty much a Disneyland vacation in your living room.
Every kid should have this movie in their home.",1468022400,,1828,4.744479495268139
369610,5,6301753534,"If you are planning a trip to Walt Disney World OR Disney Land and have children this is a must have.  It has the bouncing balls with words. How great is that??

Plus everyone can see several of the rides in action. This makes this dvd so exciting for families 'before they go' on their vacation. We used this as a ""GUESS WHERE WE ARE GOING"" moment. I think we were just as excited as the children.
I had it on VHS 20 years ago and now we just ordered this for the Grandchild. ""guess where we are going""?

Ordering is easy, shipping was on time AND the DVD was in mint condition.

She just kept saying WOW!!!  It was so cute to see.  This is a perfect smallish gift to get a child, something that she will enjoy along with her siblings for a years to come.  Their family has been going to Disney World every year, so hearing these songs keeps Happy memories alive.",1438473600,,458,4.170454545454546

We watched it before a Disney vacation to get them excited about the park and watch it now to reminisce.

There is one song that features Disney villains at the Haunted Mansion that is a bit scary for my little ones, but they try to be brave. They really love the Splash Mountain segment for ""Zip a Dee Do Da."" We all love the main street songs and were thrilled to see the Main Street Singers perform the ""Right Down the Middle of Main Street"" song on our visit to the Magic Kingdom. We sang along!

Highly recommend this for any Disney fan, young or old.",1438041600,2,730,3.9591836734693877
369852,3,6301753534,"The movie itself is pretty much as fun for my grandchild as it was for my kids many years ago.  What is highly disappointing is the quality of the video itself.  The DVD version looks very ""washed out"", no blue skies in this movie.  Purchase this DVD for some silly songs the kids will have fun dancing to; don't purchase it if you expect high definition or good sound quality for you will be disappointed.",1438041600,,406,4.386666666666667

It's just the characters running around Disneyland and dancing to classic disney tunes. There are lots of other dvd in this sing along collection but most of them are cheesy and focus more on the kid actors rather than the characters.

Roger Rabbit is in it which is a little random for my kids because they are 2 and 5 so they don't know who he is, lol!  Also the country bears, lol, which are no longer at Disneyland.

My nephews (5 and 3) absolutely love watching it as well - they are big Disney fans but have not been able to visit the parks yet. Some of the songs aren't as well known and the ""great outdoors"" song with the bears is a little outdated, as the bears aren't really used that much in the parks in my experience. Also, when the boys watch it I usually skip the Haunted Mansion song, although that will be good to help them prepare to visit the parks when they're a little older!",1434412800,,573,3.905982905982906

369920,5,6301753534,"In the early 1990s, my much younger little sister got this on VHS and I, as the dutiful big sister, had to watch it with her.  Thousands of times.  I'm not kidding.  She loved it - it was her favorite Sing Along Songs episode, and soon my teenaged self enjoyed watching it with her.  Now I have a son and I thought to look for it, and was happy that the exact same one is still being sold!

For SoCal kids who grew up going to Disneyland in the 80s, this is a beautiful time capsule of the Disneyland of childhood.  The Peoplemover, Tomorrowland Rockets, Tom Sawyer's Island, Sky Buckets through the Matterhorn, and Jungle Cruise drivers that shot the hippos with guns - they're all still at the Disneyland in this video.  Roger Rabbit was the new character at the time it was filmed, to provide a frame of reference for how pre-Princess, pre-Pixar this is.  The songs mainly feature characters from Alice in Wonderland, Mary Poppins, and Winnie the Pooh, and the original classic characters like Chip n' Dale, Pluto, Donald, Goofy, Minnie, and Mickey.  I confess find it somewhat refreshing to see all the old characters, though I'm sure kids of today will wonder where Lightning McQueen and the Princesses are.  The image quality is not the best.  I'm guessing it was dubbed directly from the VHS, so things are a little fuzzy.  But my son doesn't care.  He loves it too, just like his auntie.  I'm glad I have it, as no matter how much Disneyland changes, I will always have this to remind me of how it was when I was young.",1432252800,4,1527,4.465703971119134

My son and I have watched this approximately 50 times and we never get tired of it. I just wish they would release a new version!

This was one of the only videos they all sat still for when they were 18 months old and I needed to keep them busy for a short time.

I saw lots of negative feedback on this item and realized it was the parents opinions, not the child's on this DVD. So with that being said this video is very enjoyable.

Although the video is very dated, it still reminds them of many of their experiences on the trip.  I would love if Disney created a new video that incorporated the new rides and areas of the park, but the kids love this video, so I have no major complaints.

We conviced our 3.5 year old daughter that the Haunted Mansion song was silly (instead of spooky; she had to watch it from the other room the first couple of times), and it is now her favorite song on the dvd.",1383091200,,591,4.113043478260869
370352,5,6301753534,"Here where I live, when Disney released the Sing Along Song collections they only realeased 14 of its 34 volumes. My parents bough them all. Sadly, Disneyland Fun was not one of those fourteen, and it was only in recent years that I found that it and nineteen others existed. So what was I to do? Were the twenty I've never known any good as the fourteen I grew up with, or was the reason that they were not released was that they were so bad. I decided to take a gamble by buying this.

I chose this one to begin with the missing twenty because I have been to Disneyland USA once before when i was fifteen, and thus far it was the happiest day of my life, and ever since I've always wanted to go back. I've wanted to relive those good memories.

I got more than I bargained for. Starting with the traditional beginning of the Sing Along Songs video, we had the animation with Professor Owl and his students, and then Tinker Bell comes along and changes the scenery to a live action day at Disneyland where the hosting is then taken up by Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Minnie, Daisy, Chip 'n Dale, and Roger Rabbit. What follows is the presentation of classic songs such as Following the Leader, It's A Small World and Grim Grinning Ghosts set against footage of children and families spending a joyful day at Disneyland alongside the Disney characters.

Disneyland Fun thus has provided me with three things, the first being reliving the happy memories of my one day there at Disneyland. The second is that it has helped me make up my mind into getting the rest of the missing twenty, and I will. And the third and most important thing of all, it has deepened my wish and desire to return there for Fun, Magic, and More.",1379116800,3,1725,4.401253918495298

I can't tell if she likes it, but she it quiet while she watches it so I am calling it a win. It features most of the major Disney characters- Mickey and his crew. Bizarrely Roger Rabbit is heavily featured, I guess a sign of the time it was filmed 1990. Which brings me to my next point, the video quality is very poor and styles of the people in the crowd are hysterically outdated. We're talking Magnum PI moustaches, big crispy perms, fanny packs and acid wash galore. It's a fine DVD, but could stand some updates.

Now that I have my 9 month old IDK what made me think to search for it on DVD with Amazon I had searched in the past a few yrs ago with no luck. Watching it now brought back so many memories of my childhood and as cheesey as this sounds it almost made me cry watching it again with my kids who by the way loved it. My first trip to Disneyland I was about 5 or 6 and have wonderful memories with my father as well as my husband with his father who passed away when my husband was about 13 from Cancer. We recently made a trip to Disneyland and had so much fun and looking at it now its definitely changed these past 20 yrs. from whats seen in the video( roughly made around the 1990's). Our most memorable ride although short is the Peter Pan ride which we both share that memory with our fathers and the dumbo ride too. Now when our our 9 month old has his 1rst birthday we plan to take him so we can now share that same experience on those two rides like we did with our parents.

Yes it is outdated (bad hairstyles from the early 90s give me bad flashbacks!), however Disney is timeless.

I really thought he would be bored with it and we would watch a song or two (my husband even joked that I really bought it for ME and not my son LOL).

Well, we have watched it about 8 times in four days -- and if my son had any say we would have watched it even more. He is fascinated with it -- he either sits on my lap or sings and dances for the entire show (depending on how tired he is).  He yells all the character names as they come on (some I didn't even think he knew) and loves to see the kids.

This is the first non-animated show he's watched and I am so surprised at how into it he is.

My only drawback is (as previous reviewers have said) it is VERY dated. I can't complain too much though, I'd much rather have these songs in my head than anything Barney sings. Give me a silly-ole-bear over a big purple dinosaur any day.",1310860800,,1042,3.919431279620853

The greatest thing about this DVD is that if you change the language to French (which we're trying to teach our toddler), they completely refilmed the video in Disneyland Paris.  Some of the songs are the same (but in French), but the French version includes several songs that are different than the English version.  So, when we watch the video 3 and 4 times in a row, we can switch back and forth between English and French and not have to watch and listen to the same thing over and over again.

Possibly he still has a presence there in Toontown, I wouldn't know.  No matter either way.  Our whole family enjoys this, it is our daughter's favorite DVD and the only one she will ask for.

As for me, I was born and raised in Orlando and went to Walt Disney World at LEAST twice a year from 1973-2003. I am a Disney fanatic and I love the theme parks. And a lot of adults wrote positive reviews here about this video. So I figured there was no way I wouldn't enjoy this, but I have to say I really didn't! It was... hmmm... well, tacky. It didn't bring back 'fond memories' of my trips; instead it seemed like a bad late night infomercial for some little rinky-dink attraction. This might partly be because it's for Disneyland and not the Magic Kingdom, but they aren't THAT different. It seemed like its creators were so determined to make it seem like ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" that everything was WAY overdone, and everyone including the 'guests' were overacting to the EXTREME for the video. It was clearly made in the late 80s or early 90s so the people looked goofier than Goofy. It would be great if Disney would do an updated, modern version of this and make it classier.

I'm almost tempted to buy it for my 3-month-old cousin. It is outdated and some of the rides are now long gone but kids aren't going to notice. Disney should do a new one, perhaps for the 20th anniversary of the video with some of the more recent rides.

I grew up watching these Sing Alongs over and over, so much that the VHS tapes were ruined (lol).  So for all you Disney and Disneyland fans this is a must have.

I wish people would understand that this Sing Along is called ""Disneyland Fun""... so for the entire DVD to be about Disneyland is more than expected... plus if you had seen this when you were younger than it should be no surprise to you.  As well as Grim Grinning Ghosts and how some feel it should have been cut out of the DVD... the Haunted Mansion is a huge part of Disneyland, so if Disney would have cut that segment out of the DVD... well I would have been outraged. Sure its scary if your like two years old, so then fast forward it if thats the case...

We played the French version one day and she loved it (eventhough she doesn't know any French words except Bonjour!).  The French version is done at Euro Disney so the scenes are very different and are lovely.  She loves the English one and the French one equally....so it is like having two DVDs!
I have to say that there is one song in the haunted mansion that is a bit scary but she doesn't mind it at all.  This song is on both versions but is slightly different.  But Donald duck is funny in that song since he is pretending to be a ghost so he makes her laugh, and she doesn't think it is scary.",1247184000,,722,4.16546762589928

There is a spooky song outside the Haunted Mansion but they have never been scared of it (and they are afraid of other spooky things). I think because there are characters they know (ie Donald) in the song it helps.

Yes, it is dated...but kids don't notice or care. And I think it's refreshing. Nostalgic for the parents to see the way Disneyland used to look and kids and parents are modestly dressed.

370974,5,6301753534,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a great DVD, especially for little ones.  I shared it with my infant daughter once or twice a week three months prior to our Disney World vacation.  Even at nine months, when we recently visited, she seemed to recognize the characters and music and while other babies her age cried or hid their faces from the costumed characters, my daughter readily hugged them and shook with excitement.  I give this DVD much of the credit.

I am writing this review to alert buyers that, even though it is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging, this DVD edition also offers a terrific half-hour bonus program.  On the Language selection page, one has the option of choosing ""French"" instead of ""English.""  This launches a completely different 30-minute program filmed at Disneyland Paris and even features a couple of different songs.  Of course, the voices and lyrics are in French, but it's a terrific glimpse at the Paris park in the early 1990s and is equally fun for my infant daughter.

This ""special feature"" is unique to this one singalong DVD, but I am thrilled to see it included.  It doubles the running time and makes it really worth while as a purchase.  However, it is so well hidden (on the Language menu), that I'll bet that half of the people who own this DVD don't even realize that it's there, waiting to be enjoyed.",1231113600,,1366,4.654166666666667

It was shot in the early 90's right about the time I was graduating from high school so the scenery and fashions really bring back some memories. It also provides a time-capsule look at rides gone past like the People Mover, Skyway, the OLD Tom Sawyer's Island, Tomorrowland before the makeover and more. The kids love it too and seem to really enjoy the ""Main Street USA"" and ""Step-N-Time"" sequences. Good production values and fun for the kids.

I should also note there is an Easter egg. Select soundtrack options and French and you will be treated to a completely different version recorded a few years later at Disneyland Paris, and of course all the songs are in French. It a great look at a beautiful park.",1212278400,,805,4.513698630136986

I bought this one because other reviews said it helped get their children excited for a trip to Disney, being filmed in the park. I turned it on for my daughter, watched for a few minutes, and then went to cook dinner in the kitchen. About 20 minutes later she came running in with tears streaming down her face, terrified of the ""bad guys."" When I watched the DVD later, I realized there is a song from the Haunted Mansion that features the Disney villians including the always scary witch from Snow White, as well as a variety of ghosts, haunted trees, and even the floating witch head you see in a crystal ball while on the Haunted Mansion ride. Yes, too scary for a little kid.
I think including this segment was totally unecessary and showed VERY poor judgement on the part of the Disney producers. Now my daughter refuses to watch the DVD (not that I'd let her), and is adament that she does NOT want to go to Disneyworld where the ""bad guys live."" Not exactly the outcome I was hoping for!

My wife & I bought a used VHS copy of it, and from the moment we first put it on for him, he was enthralled and his eyes rarely move away from the screen whenever it's playing. We were surprised to find that it was available on DVD, so we bought it for our son's birthday recently, because the 17-year old tape was quickly wearing out!

""Disneyland Fun"" was originally part of a 14 volume VHS video series released in the late 1980's; this particular video was filmed on location at Disneyland in 1990, and follows a singular group of children around the park as they participate in the various song sequences alongside many of the classic Disney characters. Even if you didn't know when it was shot, the time period is quite easy to detect with the brightly colored clothes and big hair on display everywhere, as well as the appearance of the then-new character Roger Rabbit, hot on the heels of his popularity from the 1988 film.

But as dated as the proceedings may be, there is a great deal of fun to be had, and the songs are timeless & downright infectious; they'll stick in your head like glue and you'll find yourself singing along them, even when you're not watching it!  My son's favorites are ""I'm Walking Right Down The Middle Of Main Street U.S.A."", and the all-time classics ""It's A Small World"" and ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", complete with an awesome, show-stopping fireworks display.

I'd recommend this video highly to anyone with children, but also as a way of appealing to the child in all of us; great fun!",1176854400,4,1575,4.535211267605634

Daddy hated it -- 'cuz yes, it's an ad. Lots of sweet food, the Disneyland parades and rides and characters; like many reviewers he didn't like the concept of paying to watch an ad. But I honestly believe this helped our daughter enjoy the family trip to one of my favorite places ;-D  Especially the teacups ride and Small World!

But now, several months after our trip, I appreciate a few additional things. This video is the only place I've heard a rare Sherman Brothers song, Makin' Memories, written for a Kodak-sponsored pre-show to a Disneyland attraction. It's simple, but the smooth bridge melody acts as a counterpoint to the rest of the song, it's really interesting. It's also the only full Rumbly in my Tumbly we've found, and Pooh Bear is now her favorite.

She's now three, and she still likes to watch the Disneyland video. She mixes up her own experiences with the movie's, for example she says she didn't like riding Thunder Mountain (which of course she didn't ride.) She does say There's the boats, on the Jungle Cruise.

This show taught her that the characters she loves are big. As big as Daddy. (Which translated later into ""Goofy's like Daddy!"" my favorite quote of the whole trip.)

It taught her that they like hugging kids. She still didn't want a hug, but she was happy to stand right next to them as opposed to running in the other direction screaming.

It prepared her for sitting still to watch shows and parades. It prepared her for the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Haunted Mansion. (Yes, we took her on those; I wasn't scarred by my early visits either. She held tight to our hands and knew she was going in a dark place but she'd seen it before.)

My main advice to Disney is to make a new version. This was made before Toontown, before the Disney Princesses made it big, before the complete revamping of Tomorrowland, before Bear Country became the Hundred Acre Wood, before Toy Story and the Pixar collaboration. Yes, parents will bring their kids to Disneyland anyway, but an updated video showing kids enjoying the favorite Disneyland spots will make it easier to introduce the tiny ones, which in turn is easier on the parents, which makes them want to return sooner ;-)",1150934400,12,2389,4.620283018867925

I LOVE Disney and all that comes with it. The past years have been crazy with so many changes that were done to the magic.

Walt would roll over in his grave.

But we all come back and want more. No matter what they charge and change.

My 2.5 year old one has been wanting to go to Disney World.

I hope to take her soon.

This DVD is Disney Land but it doesn't matter.

I wished they had more characters in it. The people/ kids that take part in this DVD are not too bad. Most are acting with genuine joy and glee. At least we don't have to stare at fake smiles.

I do like they put Mary Poppins in. THat was a nice surprise.

But where are the princesses?

I saw Snow White ones... but come no.

We love Mickey of course and Minney and Goofey.

I know what people say with the murchandise. I expected that they would show something. It is okay. Not too much. They show what they have to offer on Mainstreet and how kids love to purchase the hats etc.

Keep in mind this is a Disney Land DVD. Not a Sing along Tape of  movies.

So of course they show some of their amusement park and what all can be done with it. It actually serves as a great introduction to the park. This DVD.

It moves really fast and Donald even shows up. How neat is that?

Why did I give it a 3 star?

HUNTED MANSION.. be aware.

It took me by surprise here. Before I knew it she was watching the Hunted Mansion. They do a song and dance in front of it.

I believe this is the longest dance and sing along number of the entire movie. Go figure. And it is really enticing for little eyes.

THey show brief clips of the ride at the mansion.

They show close up of the faces and grimaces dancing in front of the house in the yard. It doesn't feel like Disney.

Disney to me, I can turn on ( especially a sing along DVD) and if needed walk away to take care of something and return knowing my daughter saw nothing bad or scary.

So this took me by surprise. And I disliked it.

I wished they had not made this lengthy song and dance out of it.

Now I can't just turn it on for her instead I have to skip which makes her mad. Therefore it only gets a 3 star from me.

There are many other songs they could have used instead and it would have enticed more to sing along but this is what they chose and it is a fine DVD. With some issues.",1143676800,3,2333,3.9400428265524625

371178,5,6301753534,"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old in 11/05. We went to Disney World in January and I had read that the characters sometimes scare preschool children so I got this so she could see the characters interacting with children and also get an idea of what Disney World was. Disney Land is featured in the video, but since the Magic Kingdon in Disney World was modeled after Disney Land, it still did the trick. It quickly became a family favorite. My husband likes to do the silly rap version of ""Zipideedoodah"" and my daughter's favorite is ""Following the Leader"". When we got to Disney, she had no fear of the characters and anticipated the rides. She seemed a little afraid of the Haunted Mansion on the DVD, but recognized it when we were there and rode it without incident. Since our trip, she still loves to watch it and points out who she saw and what she rode. I don't know that she would like it as much if we hadn't associated it so much with our trip, but I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone wanting to show a child what Disney World or Land is all about. One funny note, I had never heard the song ""Walking Right Down the Middle of Main Street"". When we walked into the Magic Kingdom and onto Main Street, there were street performers ""singing"" and dancing to the song and we knew every word!",1142553600,4,1314,4.345528455284553

Extremely catchy, memorable songs that everyone (not just kids) will end up singing and delightful footage of all corners of the theme park are the biggest reasons to own the video. Costume-character people, from the main Disney gang to Chip and Dale, Roger Rabbit, Pooh Bear, & various movies such as Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book, Peter Pan, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and lots of others dance around with happy children and have a blast like no other running willy-nilly all over Disney--riding things, eating things, and watching a sweet parade.

Not only that, but the fact that it is live-action with super cheesy kid actors and characters in costumes really dates it.

The songs are performed by favorite Disney characters and a group of kids who are there to add to the show instead of ham it up for the camera, all perfomed against a backdrop of 1989 Disneyland, complete with crowds. Grown up afficianados of Disneyland will delight in revistiting attractions (and fashions) long gone. As for children, out of all the sing alongs, this was the only one my 2 year old would watch, and the only one that kept her attention begining to end. The songs are catchy, some original and some related to the park, and never boring. There is a loose storyline to keep to keep the action rolling, starting with the characters readying the park for opening and wrapped up with a very well staged ""When You Wish Upon a Star""...which gives a bona fide finale!

The video is one of the best Disney videos ever made and should be included in any video collection.

When I can't be in Disneyland or if I am planning to go soon, I pop in my tape to get ready for the big event.  The film is pretty short (only 29 min.) but features all your favorite characters, rides and attractions at the Anaheim Disneyland Resort.  There is a good dose of Main Street USA activity with parades, Pooh and his friends get rumbly in the tumbly at the Riverbell Terrace restaurant, the Grim Grinning Ghosts come out to socialize in and right outside of the Haunted Mansion and so much more!  My true favorite is ""Zip a Dee Do Da,"" since Roger Rabbit is in there going on a bunch of the rides (some of which are now retired and long gone).

Watching this makes me want to go straight to Disneyland, although I think this was filmed at Disneyworld, as Main Street looks different on this.  Anyway, the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the Haunted Mansion selection was a poor choice for the video, since the viewership would obviously be little kids, the music is scary, and I don't care for the whole haunted spirit theme of that ride to begin with.  That part is scary for my toddler and I have to fast forward it every time.  I wish that part was not in the video.

We bought a couple other Sing-A-Longs after this (Campout at Walt Disney World, and the Disneyland: Happy Haunting one), and they don't compare to this one.  Those videos star cheesy kids who ""act"" for the camera and try to be cute.  The kids in this video are really there to simply help create the environment, even though you see the same group of kids throughout the video.
Plus, this video concentrates more on the characters and the attractions, than the kids (during the Haunted Mansion song, it stars only the Villians and you practically ride the entire ride!).  Which makes it fun for adults and fans of Disneyland - it plays like a Disneyland home video!  Also, this was filmed around 1989-1990, just after Splash Mountain opened. Which means you get to see several attractions and restaurants that are no longer there: the Rocket Jets, People Mover, and Submarine - all in pre-1998 Tomorrowland.
