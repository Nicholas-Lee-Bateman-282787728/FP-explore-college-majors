8425312,2,B002MWB332,"If it wasn't for the fact that this was the first feature film directed by Stanley Kubrik (1928-99), this film would never be viewed at all. A completely amateurish project, even Kubrik was ashamed of it and spent a considerable amount of time and effort buying up prints and destroying them, and jaw boning people not to allow it to be shown. But thanks to the efforts of the George Eastman House the film was saved and restored in 1988.

For those of you who aren't familiar with Kubrik's works, he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing 5 times (""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""2001"", ""Dr. Strangelove""), as Best Director 4 times, and his films were nominated for Best Picture 3 times. His only win was for Best Visual Effects for ""2001"". Among his 12 feature films were also ""Paths of Glory"" (1957), ""Spartacus"" (1960), and ""Lolita"" (1962).

But all of this came later. Here in 1953, on a budget of $30,000, he made his first feature, an allegory about war in which 4 soldiers caught behind enemy lines try to make it back to safety. The allegory is heavy handed as is his camerawork, the acting is just terrible, and the audio tract is dubbed and it's easy to tell. None of the characters look, sound, or act like soldiers, nor are there any ""special effects"" or even any ""effects"" at all.

FWIW - In 1953 $30,000 wasn't a small sum. You could buy a house for that amount.

It's certainly a good student project, but there's nothing here to even remotely hint at his coming greatness as a director and writer.

If you're a big Kubrik fan (as I am) you may find yourself watching this film for historical reasons, in which case, enjoy the appearance of noted director Paul Mazursky (1930) as a disturbed soldier. This was Mazursky's first film, and while he continued his acting career (50+ films) he is best known for writing and/or directing such Oscar nominated films as ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" (1969), ""Harry and Tonto"" (1974), and ""An Ummarried Woman"" (1978).

Look for noted actor Frank Silvera (1914-70) as the Sergeant. Silvera started acting the previous year and made a memorable appearance as Huerta in ""Viva Zapata"" (1952). He transitioned to TV shortly after this film and had a long and successful career with the occasional film (""Valdez is Coming"", ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"")",1323993600,,2338,4.67639902676399
8425313,4,B002MWB332,"As the raft cohered out of the fog before the credts, I realized that I now knew what one of Rod Serling's half-hour teleplays would look & sound like if expanded to fit an hour slot. Mixed results, to say the least. Nonetheless, ""Fear & Desire"" is required viewing for those who (as I do) revere Kubrick, & worthwhile for those who decidedly don't. It's been suggested that this earliest of his oeuvre foreshadows ""Apocalypse Now"" rather than any of Kubrick's own later work-- point taken, but only as a string quartet may resemble a symphony. There is concision here, although seemingly endless shots of downed airmen walking through the woods may bring the glaze to one's eyes. Imagining these fellows as apes or droogs doesn't help. Nor does the way-too-zealous score, the stream of consciousness babble, the sonorous narration. This is still apprentice work, which the director later tried to suppress. Yet here in nascent form are many of the themes & cinematic tropes that marked the films to come: the bleak take on human nature, the over-determined pacing, the visual symmetries, the stylized action, etc. ""Paths Of Glory"" appeared less than ten years after ""Fear & Desire""-- not a bad learning curve, that.",1323907200,,1216,4.9365853658536585
8425314,2,B002MWB332,"The rating here is for both the print and the movie. Stanley Kubrick's first full-length feature is difficult to come by in a decent print form, but although the picture quality on this Echelon Studios DVD is washed out and wobbly like a TV transmission from the Horsehead Nebula, and the running time is 10 minutes under the one stated on the box, at least the image is watchable and can be improved with a bit of tweaking of the TV display settings, and the time anomaly turns out to be a small mercy rather than a shortcoming. Conversely, the sound is crystal clear, which doesn't compliment the director's life-long penchant for post-production looping too well. As for the film, aside from the menace evoked in the scenes involving a captured peasant girl, the story of a handful of military-plane crash survivors making their way back through enemy lines is much more redolent of students playing soldiers in the undergrowth than it is an indicator of Kubrick's extraordinary future work. Strangely, some of the best shot scenes prefigure Apocalypse Now rather than Full Metal Jacket, though the first-person narrative observations are less Michael Herr than they are pretentious hogwash.",1258243200,5,1194,5.005025125628141
