5578471,5,B00BCMT4D4,This was a gift for my grandson. He loves this show and was thrilled with this collection..I know he watches this over and over.,1391126400,,128,4.375
5578472,5,B00BCMT4D4,I haven't had cable/satellite for years. This is the only show that I have really missed seeing.thanks for a good quality program.,1388448000,,130,4.954545454545454
5578473,3,B00BCMT4D4,"One of my favorite shows, this collection though was filled with mediocre episodes.  I do wish that these releases were a bit larger as well, or had more of a theme to them since in the history of the show they have had many episodes that sort of overlap.  Such as the duct tape episodes and the alcohol myths",1386115200,,309,4.220338983050848
5578474,4,B00BCMT4D4,"With they, The Discovery Channel, would get the entire season on DVD. The collections do have a good set on episodes.",1378944000,,117,4.619047619047619
5578475,5,B00BCMT4D4,"This is collection nine of the long running Mythbuster series.  Nothing really to say at this point.  Either you like Mythbusters, in which case this is just another in a solid line of dvds, or you don't and I am not sure why you are reading this.

That said, if you don't know Mythbusters, I would recommending starting from Collection 1, but 9 isn't a bad jumping off point.  It is a nice mix of varying myths from silly myths like ""table cloth chaos"", to more serious myths like ""inverted underwater car"", and even the movie special episode for ""the green hornet"".  A nice blend to get a feel for the series.

Worth a buy, imo... but I'm bias, I own the other collections already.",1375833600,2,683,4.424
5578476,5,B00BCMT4D4,"This new Mythbusters Collection set consists of eight episodes from season 7 on two dvds, and two episodes that I'm guessing are from season 8. (Not surprising, as the last two collections were episodes from season 7). In fact, if you were to buy Season Seven from the Discovery store (as I did), the eight episodes would be on discs five & six of that set. The only difference between the discs is the order the episodes are in and the 'Mythbusters Top 25 Moments' special from disc 6 (season 7) is not included. The discs that come in the Mythbusters Collection 9 set have subtitles, something the season set doesn't have. I find it really strange that the season set doesn't have subtitles. The screen image is anamorphic widescreen - so it fills the whole screen.

Episode List
* Disc One:
* Reverse Engineering
* Table cloth Chaos
* Mini Myth Madness
* Inverted Underwater Car
* Bug Special

Disc Two:
* Green Hornet Special
* President's Challenge
* Operation Valkyrie
* Mission Impossible Mask
* Running On Water

Personally, I'd like to see them adding a few of the episodes from older series to these collections, they skipped over a number of them with the earlier collections. Would especially like the elevator drop episode.",1369872000,22,1236,4.712962962962963
5578477,5,B00BCMT4D4,"Like all Mythbusters, these episodes are both fun and interesting for the whole family. I always would recommend Mythbusters as a great choice.",1369440000,,143,5.260869565217392
