1776905,5,B00006IRH9,"This was a great show... reviews called it the 'best show no one was watching'. From the same man who does 'West Wing', 'Sports Night' is a witty, humerous, and clever sitcom, which rises above many others in terms of both acting skills of the group, and dialogue.
I beleive this set will contain the entire multi season run of the show - a great collection if truth be told.  Great cast, great writing... my only complaint - it got cancel when it should not have. Some of the best TV ever done.",1029801600,,495,4.32258064516129
1776906,5,B00006IRH9,"If you enjoy the West Wing, An American President, or any other of Aaron Sorkins work, and are a sports fan you will love Sports Night.  The series is written with intelligent adults in mind, and is both funny and thought provoking.  Hailed by critics but buried by ABC, this show should have had a much longer run. HBO tried to purchase the show, but that fell through when  Sorkin decided to move on to the West Wing.  Great cast with Peter Krause, Felicity Huffman, and several episodes with William H. Macy.  Anyone looking for smart entertainment will enjoy the  two seasons of Sports Night.",1029801600,4,596,4.628571428571429
1776907,4,B00006IRH9,"Just so you know this is a brilliant show.  It was written by Aaron Sorkin who created and writes ""The West Wing.""  It's faster and more romantically driven than the West Wing, with tight writing and excellent acting.  Well worth checking out.",1029801600,2,243,4.738095238095238

1776918,5,B00006IRH9,"I am an Aaron Sorkin fan and for me this is, in many ways, his second best series after the West Wing. Enjoy the mixture of social commentary and character development. Also, a critique of network domination. But this show piloted so many of the Sorkin innovations to TV series, even if if you don't like sports, this is a series for you",1456531200,,337,4.365079365079365

1776921,5,B00006IRH9,"It's early Aaron Sorkin and contains his signature style.  You can see the beginning of both ""The West Wing"" and ""the newsroom"".  The show combines comedy, drama and social commentary.  Highly recommended.",1451952000,,205,5.34375

1776943,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night is one of those well-written, well-cast TV series whose time never came, but, should have. I never gave it a chance in first-run episodes because its title suggested something I wouldn't have been interested in. Once Comedy Central started airing reruns and I happened upon it one day, I realized what I had missed out on, hence, the purchase of this DVD. This is a smart, sharp, adult comedy series and it's not all about sports. I found a romance between two of the characters to be particularly charming.",1420329600,,520,4.725274725274725

1776957,5,B00006IRH9,"Highly under-rated at the time. A little uneven (couldn't seem to decide when to use a laugh track or not, which was unnerving sometimes) but the writing was amazing, and look at the cast and writers and everyone else related to this, and see what they all went on to do. Love it. Also fast shipping, perfect condition, thanks!",1403049600,,327,4.559322033898305

Once or twice it has just stopped.

1776973,4,B00006IRH9,"Witty, fast-paced dialogue. Pretty good acting. Enjoyed seeing Robert Guillaume and also Peter Krause of Six Feet Under. Some meaningful scripts about unsung heroes in sports. Gets repetitive and just too cutesy after a season or less. Aaron Sorkin is a hero to me, but he gets a little too much into ""will those 2 ever get together."" After enjoying the first season I passed on the others and gave the DVD away to my apartment complex library.",1397001600,,444,4.705128205128205

1776979,5,B00006IRH9,In one half hour this show never fails to make me laugh and cry. I watch it over and over. One way to tell how good it is is to look at where all the folks acting in it are today. I have bought copies of this for friends it's that good.,1390608000,,236,3.5576923076923075

1776982,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night had the deck stacked against it.  It was on against established hit shows and it's name implied it was just another sports show.  The truth is, it was the best show no one watched.  Everyone I've shown the DVD's cannot believe the show was cancelled.  We regularly have SN marathons and laugh through episode after episode.  Many great lines from this show have become part of our regular lexicon.  This collection is a treasure.",1389312000,,442,4.75

1776985,4,B00006IRH9,"I'm a big fan of Aaron Sorkin, so this show was a must-have.  It's clearly a precursor to the West Wing, both in terms of the cast, and in terms of the pacing, which is a bit uneven in places.  However, the characters really grow on you.  I'm not a sports person, but this show is only tangentially about sports, and it actually made me appreciate some of the reasons people do like sports.  Robert Guillame is great in this, too, and the way they handled his stroke and made it part of the show was really inspiring.",1383782400,,517,4.244897959183674
1776986,5,B00006IRH9,"First, to get over the only negative:  It has a laugh track--but it's so minimal it is perhaps a real audience responding to good writing; laugh tracks, typically, laugh harder than any human would.
The writing and direction are great (of course) and the acting is uniformly competent, often very, very good.
The half-hour format produces a pacing unlike other products of Yorkin and Schamme.  It has a different feel from their hour shows--a touch more frenetic but not really hassled.
The delivery was faster than expected and the condition as new although purchased as used.",1382918400,,577,5.0

1776989,5,B00006IRH9,"The seller shipped this item quickly as promised and even refunded a portion of the purchase cost to me because an episode skipped in the middle. Great service from a quality seller.  Thanks!!

The series is fantastic. If you're a fan of Aaron Sorkin's work this won't disappoint. It's clever, funny, fast-paced, intelligent and humurous at the same time.",1372377600,,355,5.0
1776990,5,B00006IRH9,"There is no one today that writes brilliant, sharp, witty and rapid fire dialogue like Aaron Sorkin. The only thing wrong with Sports Night is the title. It really doesn't have that much to do with sports - it's a sitcom that demonstrates how the written word really comes to life when spoken by talented actors.",1372377600,,312,4.589285714285714
1776991,5,B00006IRH9,I absolutely LOVE this show! The dialogue is fast-paced and witty and I rewatch it from time to time because I enjoy the characters so much! I'm not really a sports fan but I'm definitely a Sports Night fan.,1361232000,,207,4.333333333333333
1776992,5,B00006IRH9,"A must have if you enjoy superior and intelligent writing with actors able to not only meet the level of the writing but become inspired and enhance the writing with their acting skills.

1776995,5,B00006IRH9,My son introduced this series to me when I was visiting him in another state. We stayed up very late one night (into the morning hours) watching episode after episode. I had to buy the set when I returned home so I could watch them again with my hubby. I can't believe this series was ever canceled. Worth the investment.,1358208000,,321,4.366666666666666
1776996,5,B00006IRH9,This is a classic Aaron Sorkin series with great plots and classic dialog.  The new edition adds behind-the-scenes features and outtakes.,1356998400,,137,5.523809523809524

1776998,5,B00006IRH9,"Another great series by Aaron Sorkin! The laugh track was annoying at first, but they got rid of it after a while. Good series! Wish there were more seasons :)",1354233600,,159,4.333333333333333
1776999,4,B00006IRH9,"I owned the original release of the Sports Night DVDs. These were just the episodes of the show, which I wanted after seeing a few on Comedy Central.

While there are good special features on this release, they aren't really 10 year worthy, they're what I would have expected on a first release. I checked it out and this set was released in 2008, yet it has annoying DVD menu navigation that I thought had died out (Stupid fake animations, you have to select episode by episode to see if has director's commentary. It shows each episode on a ""fake"" control room monitor....)

I like the set but it is overpriced and misnamed. A must for a Sports Night fan but be aware, like everything else with the show, some executive meddling will annoy you.",1354147200,,746,4.518518518518518
1777000,5,B00006IRH9,Love the chance to watch one of my favorite TV shows again.  It was quirky with a good cast.  Worth the purchase price.,1352419200,,119,4.130434782608695
1777001,5,B00006IRH9,"I think ""Sports Night"" is the best series Aaron Sorkin ever did - better than the overrated ""West Wing"" and much better than any of its ratings-challenged successors.

The cast is stellar (a whole bunch of future stars came out of this series), the writing taut and the tone generally light, although it falls into Sorkin-preachy sometimes.  I bought the anniversary release for the extras, which are terrific, having already bought the series the first time the series came out.  (I'll give that copy to a friend.)

I still think of Felicity Huffman every time I hear ""My Boogie Shoes"" on the radio.  ;-)",1345420800,,605,4.778846153846154
1777002,4,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night is a great show, but the video quality on these dvds could be a lot better considering the show isn't that old.

The dvd extras aren't anything special.  So I doubt the 10th Anniversary is an improvement over the original release (but I haven't seen that one to be certain).",1328400000,,287,4.5
1777003,1,B00006IRH9,Loved this show when it was on TV and loved the original 1998 boxed set -both of which are closed captioned - so I was shocked that the special 10th anniversary edition did not have closed captioning. If you need this vital feature buy the 1998 boxed set!!!,1328054400,6,257,4.375
1777004,5,B00006IRH9,Sorkin is a genius. One of the best shows ever. I highly recommend it to anyone who watched and loved West wing.,1324944000,,112,4.136363636363637
1777005,3,B00006IRH9,"The muted laugh track was annoying (but not some belated DVD addition as others allege ... it was gradually toned down throughout the season, but was always broadcast that way).

But mid-season 2, I was done with this series. Quite simply, the show (like the dialogue) goes round and round in circles. The best example is ""The Giants won the Pennant..."" Presumably some massive injoke among the writers led to characters constantly repeating the same exchange three times - perhaps in tribute to the famous broadcast line the show was named after - like other episodes on steroids.

It was excruciating and, as the show contantly tried to negotiate the passage between drama and comedy, it became increasingly incapable of either.  Here's an exchange from another episode:

Natalie: Dan did you see the revised schedule? I put it on your desk.
Dan: I'll take a look at it.
Natalie: There's a supplement meeting at 4.
Dan: I'll take a look at it.
Natalie: And then we go live at -
Dan: Natalie?
Natalie: Dan?
Dan: There's a schedule on my desk?
Natalie: Yes.
Dan: I'll take a lok at it.
Natalie: Thankyou.
Dan: That girl generates a lot of paperwork.
Natalie: I heard that.
Dan: You generate a lot of paperwork.

(and on and on and on ...)",1323129600,,1238,4.660550458715596
1777006,4,B00006IRH9,"I can't say enough good things about this ground-breaking show. The casting, writing and everything about it was excellent. Unfortunately, this show was about ten years before it's time and it only lasted for a few short years. The dvd's bring back all the memories of this amazing series. I only have one gripe and a few other's have mentioned it. This show was not filmed before a studio audience and the one thing I hate about dvd's, especially a series like this, is that a laugh track was not required. The series was pure genius and the laugh track detracts, ever so slightly, from the brilliance that is sports night. I can recall another really great series from Ireland called Father Ted. It was a brilliant series but that dang laugh track drives me nuts!

Now that I've got that off my chest let me say this about the laugh track. It's not overdone. The added laugh tracks selectively so as to detract slightly to the final product. So, you won't be bombarded with laughter coming from the dvd's. The majority of laughter you hear will be your family sitting around you watching a brilliant show that didn't get a chance to realise it's full potential. Aaron Sorkin did though. He created the West Wing a year later and the rest is history. All of the principal actors have gone on to other successes. Peter Krause has been in a number of tv movies and was in Dirty Sexy Money and most recently Parenthood. Josh Charles has been starring in the Good Wife for the past few years. Felicity Huffman turned in an Oscar-nominated performance in TransAmerica and has been starring in Desperate Housewives for years. Joseph Molina starred in The West Wing for most of it's run. Sabrina Lloyd played in Sliders and has done a few other things. Robert Guillaume still pops up from time to time on television but I think he may have retired at this point in his life.

So, after all this do I recommend this series? That would be an unequivocal yes!",1318550400,,1950,4.5685714285714285
1777007,5,B00006IRH9,"I remember Aaron Sorkin in an interview, discussing his fight with the network over the Sports Night laugh track. His description was that it ""feels like I've put on an Armani tuxedo, tied my tie, snapped on my cuff links, and the last thing I do before I leave the house is spray Cheez Whiz all over myself."" But even with the laugh track, this is SUCH a great show.",1315094400,,367,4.257142857142857

This little gem of a show has finally gotten the treatment it always deserved.  There is a full disk of extras for both seasons.  Cast intervies, commentaries galore, it's all here.  Thanks to Rhino for doing right by ""Sports Night"" and thanks to this seller for delivering such a pristine product!  Often I've received merchandise from marketplace that said ""New"" that was anything but.  I'm so proud of this set!  I would readily do business with the seller again.

I think the show still holds up, although I don't love the laugh track on there, mostly because it isn't needed. And there are some serious pacing issues on the dialog and storyline. But this is still a wonderful show with rich characters. It has that fast paced Sorkin feel, and I love the sports center feel. Oh how I wish this show had ran longer than it did!",1311033600,,471,4.2444444444444445
1777011,2,B00006IRH9,"When this show first aired on network television it was freshly original.  I do not remember a laugh track.  However, the dvd has added an annoying laugh track that makes it almost unwatchable.  Unfortunately there is not a menu item to remove the laugh track.

1777015,5,B00006IRH9,"A friend of mine recently told me that she was watching ""West Wing"" on DVD, and what with Aaron Sorkin's recent Emmy win for ""Social Network"", it was fun to get the historical view on his style of writing.  I told her that I had one problem with ""WW"" and that was it led directly to the demise of his earlier, and quirkier and in my opinion, better show, ""Sports Night.""  This conversation prompted me to get out the set and in short order, about a week or so, I watched the entire two seasons.

It's just as fresh and as funny and surprising as it was 11 years ago (I believe the newer editions of the show do not use the World Trade Center as their Manhattan establishing shot, the only glaring image that belies the age of the show). It's great to see this great cast get thrown into that walk-in-talk Sorkin style, and also see a show whose technical virtuosity - the long tracking shots that take you seamlessly through the sets from one end to the other - is still state of the art to this day.

The cast, many theater-trained, gave life to scripts that crackled with wit and intelligence.  What always amazed me was how something funny would be turned into something heartfelt, and how I quickly grew to know and love each of these characters.  Casey and Dan, brothers in front of the camera, Casey (Peter Krause) as socially awkward as the younger Dan (Josh Charles)was smooth; Dana (Felicity Huffman)- the nervous and quirky Executive Producer, Natalie (Sabrina Lloyd), Dana's assistant and line producer (always one step ahead of Dana), and Jeremy (Joshua Malina) , the staff writer/assistant producer whose eye for a story verged on the Melvillian; and Issac (Robert Guilluame), the paternal, veteran newsman who ran the sports department and held the whole gaggle together.

As other reviewers have noted, Sports Night isn't about sports, and knowledge of sports really isn't required. However, sports is such a great metaphor for some of the best human virtues - overcoming adversity, making a comeback, following a dream, toiling in obscurity to do something laudable better than anyone has done before - and all are used to dramatic, and often moving effect.

There are few shows that have packed so much into a single 22 minute episode as this show did.  I highly recommend it.",1301961600,,2293,4.698254364089776

Couldn't have been cast better.  This show was largely unknown at the time and was just starting to get its legs when some important current event happened (can't remember what) and every TV station's coverage abandoned whatever they were doing to cover it.  It's too bad.  I think this show had easily another 2 years of great viewing it could have shared.  Aaron Sorkin, not wasting any time during the break, began to develop The West Wing, and Sports Night never came back.  If you haven't become hip to Sports Night, do yourself a favor and grab a copy.  It will not disappoint. It's cast went on to Six Feet Under, Desperate Housewives, The Good Wife, In Plain Sight, Backwash, Ed, Numb3rs and many movies and other series.  Josh Charles, Peter Krause, Sabrina Lloyd, Felicity Huffman and Josh Malina all went on to do other outstanding work, but as a cast, they were golden.",1294963200,,1042,4.776536312849162

1777025,4,B00006IRH9,"In the light of the ultra-slick West Wing and even slicker Studio 60, Sports Night seems almost quaint.  But all the things that made West Wing great, and all the things we would now expect of a Sorkin/Schlamme project are evident in this, their first collaboration.  The witty and intellectual dialogue, the rallying cry of the characters (""Quality will win over flash""), and the real emotion are all hallmarks of Sorkin's writing.  Add in the kinetic visual style of Schlamme's direction and you have an engrossing and fun half-hour of television - both in the watching and in the listening.

This set has the complete series of shows and includes some commentaries from a variety of cast members and from Sorkin and Schlamme as well.  For my money, the two Joshuas' commentary is the most fun, and the S&S commentaries the most informative.  There are also many extras featurettes that are interesting (if sometimes repetative with the commentaries), including some reflections on the shows and how their favoured actors have moved on (Felicity Huffman remains the biggest star with her Desperate Housewives fame).

But it's the shows themselves that is the reason to buy these DVDs.  The cast's convincing delivery of rapid-fire dialogue in long shots that include physical action could not have been easy to do.  It's hard to pick out a key performance within the ensemble - this cast is truly the definition of an ensemble, with all characters needing to interact with all other characters (including the ""extras"" whose names are not in the opening credits).  What's almost as interesting is watching the development of the Sorkin-Schlamme style: in this show it is clearly not as polished as in their later collaborations, and the painful laugh track in Season 1 is ample proof that they didn't have all the creative control they needed.  Similarly, in Season 2 there are some plot developments that would be more at home on Three's Company, being artificial/arbitrary developments that don't seem to fit the characters as developed in Season 1 (Dana's plan for Casey to date other women, Dan's pychoses, and Jeremy's ""relationship"" with a porn actress).  It's not the way the characters deal with the problems: these are universally funny and moving.  No, the problem is that these plot developments feel arbitrary to the point that it's like someone went to the ""random sitcom plot generator"" and had it spit out some ideas.

But overall, this is a better series than just about anything else.  I give it 4 stars because it will be compared (rightly or wrongly) with later, better Sorkin fare such as the first 4 seasons West Wing and most of Studio 60.",1271116800,2,2662,4.937219730941704

I only wish that Sorkin could have continued to write Sports Night along with West Wing. I think many people thought that it was a real sports show, when it is actually a show about a show about sports.  Each character has their own sarcastic charm and the banter between them is hilarious. Mostly comedic, but the show has it's serious points, but no drama that causes that annoying soap opera feel.

His last show Studio 60, I was never able to schedule to see but have since bought the series and it was well done as well.

The characters are professional sports fans and they realize fully that they are not in the business of preserving democracy. But for all the escapism that sports entails, the show reminds us that at sports are also about human excellence. The characters themselves know it and they see their jobs as making sure their viewers remember it too. They don't speak like anyone I've ever met, many come off as neurotic from time-to-time, and they never seem to go anywhere besides the studio or the bar downstairs, but I love watching them all the same.

The best thing about it was also, for some people, probably a weakness: it's not a drama, not a comedy. It doesn't fit any customary category.  A typical half-hour espisode is a drama that makes you laugh for 20 minutes because the people in the drama love to make one another laugh (and you laugh with them). And then, in the last 5-10 minutes, it will nail some truth about human beings in a way that will probably bring tears to your eyes.

The story arc where Josh Charles' character was forced to apologize for remarks he made regarding drug use - brilliant.  Just one of many examples that could be sited.  Though I was sad to see this show go, in retrospect where would we be without Peter Krausse in Six Feet Under or the promising Dirty Sexy Money or Felicity Huffman's amazing Career. And I wonder if Sabrina Lloyd would have found the time for her work with Hal Hartley. What we are left with is an incredibly tight 2 season set with a beautiful singular vision and execution comparable in quality if not subject matter with Lynch's Twin Peaks.  Just like that show, its end was inevitable and beautiful.",1221696000,3,947,4.482558139534884
1777048,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night was a frequently brilliant show that aired for two seasons in the late 1990s and had a hard time finding an audience because it was a ""smart"" show. I'm still curious as to when that term became pejorative. I didn't watch it at the time, though I caught it on Comedy Central and on DVD when it first came out. Lost the DVDs some time ago and I was daunted by the $100+ prices for a used copy. So, I'm glad that the series is getting reissued, and with special features to boot!

Sports Night doesn't really require any knowledge of or interest in sports to enjoy. It's like other Sorkin projects in that an appreciation of witty dialogue, compelling characters and strong plots (especially in Season Two) are all that is really needed. And the show goes above and beyond just these elements as well: has there ever been so cutting an exploration of male friendships and the competitiveness and jockeying for position that occurs within them? Has there ever been so thorough a deconstruction of a broadcasting professional (outside perhaps of Larry Sanders) as that of Josh Charles's Dan? And how hilarious is Peter Krause? That one has an answer: pretty darned hilarious. One sees within these two seasons the potential for a great show--the second season, in particular, is absolutely brilliant. So many intense emotions coming in waves--it cut far deeper than most television shows, perhaps because it asked more of us.

This is not to say that the show is perfect--it isn't. For one thing, Sorkin really doesn't write well for women. While Felicity Huffman and Sabrina Lloyd are both quite good in their roles, the roles lack much in the way of femininity. Sorkin has women characters that basically act like men, for all intents and purposes. Not that it's a deal-breaker for the show--one would imagine that women who work in the domain of sports would be just a bit tomboyish--but one can't help but wonder whether or not Sorkin really gets women. The usual Sorkin caveats apply: plot threads are picked up and dropped haphazardly, characters drop off the face of the earth. And someone ought to tell Aaron Sorkin that having one character come in and repeat what another person said is technically not comedy. Regardless of all this, the show is a work of genius, and both it's flaws and virtues are unmistakeably Sorkin's own. It might as well be his own personal manifesto.",1220832000,9,2394,4.766265060240964
1777049,5,B00006IRH9,"Writer/creator Aaron Sorkin and director Thomas Schlamme went on to develop NBC's ""The West Wing"" during the second season of this wonderful series.

From the beginning, ABC had no clue of how to handle this show. First, they insisted that the producers ad a laugh track, because you don't know when to laugh. Then, they started to promote it like a soap opera, because it had serious issues to deal with at times.

Ultimately, the quality of the show came through. A fabulous cast provided excellent performances. Josh Charles (""A Few Good Men"", ""SWAT"") and Sabrina Lloyd (""Sliders"") are the MVPs here, consistently giving the show it's heart. Peter Krause (""Six Feet Under"", ""Dirty Sexy Money""), initially stiff in his ""on air"" role as Casey McCall, settled in well mid-first season.

The real gem here is Robert Guilamme (""Benson""), his Issac Jaffe is an excellent character brought to life with his gentle touch. Guilamme's real-life stroke was written into the series, and when he returned in the second season made for some wonderful moments and sly dialogue delivered by the veteran actor.

Unfortunately, try though they may, Shout! Factory has been unable to provide the option of killing the laugh track in the set. Fortunately, they have provided a great new set which beats the original cheap, no-frills set that Disney provided several years ago.",1220572800,10,1359,5.026666666666666

The original show, when it aired on NBC, was not filmed in front of a studio audience and therefore there were no audience laughter, etc.  When Comedy Central aired it they added a laugh reel as if it were filmed in front of an audience.  I don't want help with where I should laugh so hopefully the new box set will not have that.

That boxset will now be going to one of the many friends who has borrowed it over the years.  Thankfully we finally get a feature filled release of this great show.  The features look interesting, especially the comments from the real Sports Center anchors.

As for the show, it is just great.  The acting is well above what you see on most television shows (especially at the time).  Of course Robert Guillaume (Benson) is great.  Several of the actors have gone off to make their name on other shows, highlighted by Peter Krause and Felicity Huffman.  I am waiting for Josh Charles to get his big break.  His character Dan Rydell, was easily my favorite on the show.

The writing is excellent.  Aaron Sorkin certainly lives up to his reputation here.  The dialog is fast paced and enjoyable.  It can get repetitive at times, but it never bothered me.  I love the rhythm that the characters use to talk to each other.  Especially Dan and Casey.  Although the show is funny, it is more a ""dromedy"" more then a ""sit-com"".  The show bounces between serious issues and comedy usually quite naturally.  There were a couple of story lines that I could have lived without, but overall the episodes are engaging, humorous, and very well done.  Sports Night is a great show.

In its place was a genuine revelling in the human condition, faith in the basic goodness of we wonderfully flawed mortals, and more wit than television has ever seen.

I am so grateful it was on the air.

And now, there's this new set, which (according to the press release) includes the following:

""2 discs of exclusive bonus features that reveal the genesis, life and afterlife of the series with all-new interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, gag reels, deleted scenes, and commentaries featuring the principal cast and creative team.""

The one bonus the press release specifically notes is, ""Real vs. Reel: ESPN employees compare their real-life experiences with the characters on Sports Night.""

A 10th Anniversary book is also part of the package.",1215388800,19,1310,5.126760563380282
1777053,5,B00006IRH9,"I of course cannot comment on the actual box set, since there is little information provided by Amazon on disc details at time of writing (early July 2008).

However, this was one of my favorite shows when it was on in the late 90's (I cannot believe it's been 10 years already!!!).  And, it is still in my top 5 of all time to this day.

Why?  Well, for one thing, just look what some of the key people involved have gone on to do after making Sports Night: The West Wing (Creator/Writer/Producer Aaron Sorkin, actor Josh Malina, plus guest spots by many SportsNight regulars), Six Feet Under (Peter Krause), Desperate Housewives (Felicity Huffman).  For each of these pros, 'Sports Night' was a key launchpad for the rest of their careers.

(And, of course, the already well-respected Robert Guillaume was a key member of the cast. He suffered a debilitating stroke mid-production and still gave bravura perfomances on his return.)

This show is one of the rarest of TV gems:  a comedy that does not pander, that challenges you to keep up.  Anyone who regularly watched the first few seasons of 'The West Wing' will recognize one of Sorkin's favorite devices, the fast-talking, no-pauses, walking-down-the-hallway conversation.  This device is not to everyone's taste, but it's a great one for the right actors and writers, and a certain species of TV viewer.

And yet, the show rewards even casual viewers with witty, incisive, insightful commentary and critique of just about everything.  It's just plain funny most of the time.

The tagline was ""It's about sports. The way Charlie's Angels was about law enforcement"".  And that about sums it up.  Its focus is on human relationships in that most volatile environment, the workplace.

This workplace just happens to be an even more of a pressure-cooker than most:  a TV studio producing live sports news shows.  Think 'ESPN SportsCenter'. Yet, it's not supposed to actually be SportsCenter, since they wisely wink to reality and refer to ""Bristol"" (the actual city where ESPN is headquartered) as their competition. I always thought this was a clever device, since ESPN is a sister company to ABC, the network 'Sports Night' ran on.  Eveyone else (Fox, CNN, et al) has tried to beat ESPN at its own game, and lost, and 'Sports Night' keeps that feeling of being a decided underdog.

Though the stakes aren't as high for the rest of the world, the pressure of the environment to the people in it (and therefore by extension to the viewer) is much like Sorkin's 'West Wing' -- not as many dramatic world crises, but still plenty of ""must react NOW!!!"" raw material that Sorkin and team mine for sublime comic effect.

Yes, it's funny, very funny in fact.  But what appealed to me most is that quite often Sports Night could be poignant, even at times dramatic.  Again, not the faux-gavitas that most sitcoms try to attain with that corny, ""a very special episode of..."", ripe-for-satire phoniness.  When there is deep human emotion to be felt, the show portrays it in just the right quantities.  Breakups, lost career opportunities, even some of the ficitious ""real world"" storylines have just that much more feeling of real human emotion than do just about any other TV comedy, or even many TV dramas.  Most of that reality is due to the characters being portrayed as fleshed-out human beings, at least as much as can be done in a 30-minute TV format.  They aren't exactly true to life, but they aren't just cardboard cut-outs either.  An excellent example is how Robert Guillaume's real-life stroke, and subsequent return to the show, was handled onscreen: brilliantly, of course.

In the end, if you are like me, you will love Sports Night mainly for the charcaters themselves.  I really came to like them, a lot.  I wanted to know more about them.  Even the guest spots were intriguing, like Felicity Huffman's real-life husband, William H. Macy, as a show ""fixer"".  That's why the cancellation was so painful for so many.  I had to wait another five years for another TV comedy that could rival it -- 'Arrested Development', another cult fav that was killed too early.  I think if a show like 'Sports Night' was pitched today, it would probably find a comfy home on cable, and live for many seasons.  However, it was at least five years ahead of its time for that.  And network TV is notorious for handling quality shows badly.

If you watched it while it was on, this box set is a great chance to relive its greatness.  If you never had the pleasure, please take the opportunity now to explore something very special.",1214870400,50,4575,4.779617834394904

Yet, almost every episode I watched felt like it was somehow special.

But then I thought, well, maybe my memory is flawed.  So I did, in fact, rent the 6 discs and re-watched.  After a slightly slow start, by mid-first season, I was hooked.  And by the last episode, I was furious: why, how could this gem of a show just end?  While I liked West Wing, the lighter atmosphere of a sports studio (as opposed to the White House) was perfect for the foibles of this outstanding ensemble cast.  Typical Sorkin style (its origins, in fact), with humor, pathos, romance, sweetness, tartness, and just plain humanity.  If your tastes run to some of the old shows I mentioned, you cannot help but think this show brilliant.  A keeper indeed.  I'm ordering this set for my collection now.

I found the series positively addictive (and at 23 fast-moving minutes per episode, they were like potato chips ... I couldn't have just one at a time)!  I then had to order it from Amazon.com in order to have it in my collection.

The writing is fantastic, the pacing is terrific, and the characters are wonderfully quirky.  It's a workplace that you want to join!

The acting, of course, is what you would expect from Felicity Huffman, Peter Krause and Robert Guillaume - just amazing.

What an unbelievably bittersweet feeling I was left with (which can only compare to the short-lived FIREFLY series)...as cornball & mushy as it sounds, over the course of the series you grow to love these people as if they were best friends you'd known all your life. When I think of how truly class acts like this get cancelled after only 2 stellar seasons, and other LESS classy shows take their place and remain on the air.....well, to put it bluntly, it's sickening.

There are about 236 reviews ahead of mine, so I don't know what else I could add but to say this show reached a level of perfection very few ""dramedies"" ever could. Hear what I'm saying, you doubters: This show, IMHO, can easily stand alongside M*A*S*H, Hill Street Blues, All In the Family, The Practice, Seinfeld...you get my point. This is not an exaggeration. I remember watching the last episode on network TV and noticing a renegade tear running down my face, and whattayaknow, the same thing happened again tonight. And I'm the farthest thing from a sports fan you could even imagine. Casey, Dan, Isaac (<==the best role Robert Guillaume has EVER played), Jeremy, Dana & Natalie, in the course of the show's life, left indelible impressions that ANYONE who appreciates quality TV could relate to.

You hear this phrase far too often (and used loosely far too often, I might add), but IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

1777073,5,B00006IRH9,"Aaron Sorkin, best known for his intelligent and witty hit shows such as ""The West Wing"", and (most recently) ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"", started out with this small and beautiful diamond in the rough. ""Sports Night"" was Sorkin's first big project, and it shows in the sharp, fast-paced, satirical wit present in every line of dialogue.

The show follows a team of newscasters, producers, and writers who work on a late night sports news show called ""Sports Night"", a mock up of ESPN's SportsCenter. The interpersonal relationships this small group of people have are always fascinating and fun to watch, and one of the best things about this show is that even if you have no real knowledge about sports, you can *still* watch this show and not get lost at all! As a woman with very little knowledge of most sports, I *still* fell in love with this show, and I imagine it's even more awesome for a man who actually *knows* what they're talking about when it comes to all the sports lingo and statistics they ocassionally throw out there.

This show even has a little star power, and some very recognizable faces among the cast. The most obvious of which is Felicity Huffman, who is now starring on the hit show ""Desperate Housewives"" as the strong-willed soccer mom, Lynette Scavo. Felicity's husband, William H. Macy, also guest stars in a few episodes of ""Sports Night"".

This half-hour dramedy only lasted 2 seasons before it's cancellation (which was a very sad day in television), but it lives on through this incredible DVD box set. Since each episode is actually a little less than a half-hour (since there are obviously no commercials on dvd), it's really easy to start watching them and get so drawn in that you don't realize you've gone through half a season in no time at all!

Bottom line, I highly recommend this show, and I still cling to the tiny hope that network execs might someday realize their mistake in cancelling it, and bring it back on the air....but alas, that will probably never happen.",1169078400,7,2019,4.711048158640226

The show is very similar to The Larry Sanders Show in how it provides insightful details on how a television show is created from the on-screen talent to all the people who make the show go.  Sports Night also features Sorkin's trademark liberal leanings, which can sometimes be thought-provoking and other times, just some guy standing on his soap box.

The cast is pretty good, including a pre-Six Feet Under Peter Krause.  Best in the cast, however, is Josh Charles, who starts as a casual, funny anchor and then evolves into a deep, heartbreaking character.  The show is pretty funny with great dialogue.

1777083,4,B00006IRH9,"Before ""The West Wing"", before ""Studio 60"", there was ""Sports Night"". Aaron Sorkin's first foray into weekly television. ""Sports Night"" was a tip of the hat to ESPN's Sports Center. The premises followed the cast and crew of Continental Sports Channel (CSC) as they worked through office romances, gossip, and egos to put together a nightly sports show entitled, appropriately enough, Sports Night. Originally meant to be a feature film, ""Spots Night"" ended up working better as a serial and lasted for two years on ABC from 1998 to 2000. The cast included such well-known names as Felicity Huffman (Desperate Housewives), Peter Krause (Six Feet Under), and  Robert Guillaume (Soap/Benson)

The show never took off as well as Sorkin's ""West Wing"" would a year later. Though the intelligent fast paced banter between characters walking through and around their work environment was nearly identical to that of ""Wing"".  Even the topics of this half hour comedy, again like ""West Wing"", served as a sounding board for Sorkin as he spoke out against the celebrity system, the press, and racism. He would even write in Robert Guillaume's 1999 stroke into the series, which would prove to be a touching and very  sincere look at that debilitating condition.  The show would hit it's stride however when it addressed office politics. As a third placed sports show, the production team of Sports Night was always fighting against upper management, an out of touch owner, and a cranky ratings expert, played by William H. Macy. The charm of the show was derived from the relationship between Sport Night's two anchors, Dan (Josh Charles) and Casey (Peter Krause). Though both characters were straight as an arrow, their relation was the best love story on TV. Through fights, egos, and a heavy work schedule I came to understand and love their relationship of trust and commitment.

""Sports Night"" took it's time with it's audience, which was probably why it fell off the ABC schedule in 2000. Reviews were still strong, the show seemed to find it's pace, and other networks were interested but Sorkin choose to put the majority of his time in ""West Wing"" and ""Sports Night"" took it's final bow on May 16th, 2000.

The DVDs contain the entire two-year run, but there are absolutely no extras to speak of. Perhaps ""Sport Night"" wasn't as ground breaking as I remember or perhaps ""The West Wing"" stole it's thunder, regardless the show deserves better in it's DVD packaging.

I am a huge Aaron Sorkin fan and his dialogue is not for the faint of heart (perhaps one reason it didn't make it past 3 seasons on ABC back then).  You have to actually listen to the words being spoken and come to grips with the fact you are not going to be spoon fed comedy.  The comedy is there, but it is character driven through witty dialogue...no cheap jokes, no cute kids, no pratfalls, just pure genius!

The show is so much fun to watch because of the quality.  And it's the kind of show you can watch over and over again.

If you never even watched the show during it's all too brief television run, but appreciate great ensemble performances and witty writing....this is one of the best around!",1142121600,5,974,4.372222222222222

1777088,5,B00006IRH9,"I actually did it--I watched every episode of The West Wing in sequence, several episodes per day, after which I watched every episode of Sports Night (which took much less time). To those of you who are familiar with both, you probably have an opinion on which is better. So did I, but I flip-flopped after re-watching all of these. I'll let you know what it was.

Originally, I preferred West Wing, although I have, as I indicated, turned around. I enjoyed Sports Night after discovering it two years ago, however I had a number of problems with it. I felt that it veered too often toward soap opera, that it was somewhat repetitious, and that the plotting was a little loose. Although I enjoyed all the performances (especially Peter Krause as Casey and Josh Charles as Dan), I felt that the female characters never quite felt right--I chalked it up to Sorkin having trouble writing for women, just like the characters of Mandy and the First Lady in the West Wing, a little over-dramatic and aren't-I-cute-ness that frankly irritated me. The West Wing, on the other hand, was fueled with political passion, with well-constructed story arcs; it was more mature and polished. This was my unequivocal view upon original viewings of both. However, having watched them both, I realize that I was wrong.

I don't know what it is, but Sports Night just holds up better than West Wing, in spite of the greater amount of pop-culture trivia Sports Night uses. Sorkin ended Sports Night because he felt that West Wing had more potential, and he might have been right (who knows what a third season of Sports Night might have included?). However, some of my complaints about Sports Night have gone by the wayside. Take the soap opera comment--West Wing is as guilty an infractor as Sports Night on this, especially in the final two seasons of WW. It just didn't bother me as much. I found that it wasn't so much repetition as iteration in regard to the humor and plotting, the latter of which was my biggest turnaround. There's something to be said for character-driven stories which de-emphasize plotting and increase interaction among the performers. In general, Sports Night is more romantic than its successor: not in terms of love (although that too), but  in the sense of breaking the rules--and it does that in many ways. It's a dramedy, mostly without a laugh track, which manages to center itself on characters instead of plot--there is actually plotting, but we are almost convinced that there isn't one, that it's all spontaneous. It's a slight-of-hand that The West Wing never managed to pull off. The woman comment, also, was wrong. The offending scene I found was the scene where Dana, the executive producer, confronts her archnemesis Sally about her amorous relations. Upon first seeing it, I thought it way over the top and melodramatic, but now, I think that it would be how someone in that situation would react. Finally, with The West Wing, the writing and performances were polished and excellent, but in such a way that it was impossible not to notice that both were excellent. It was a show built, intentionally or not, to win awards. With Sports Night, it's not the same. The acting is so good that there is no need to show off. Josh Charles never cries or yells or displays the sort of intense emotion that wins Emmys, but his performance in the role of Dan Rydell is about as complex and pathos-ridden as any I've seen. All in all, the things that make The West Wing better the first time it's seen are the same things that make it somewhat less interesting the fourth or fifth time. With Sports Night, though, one is free to notice new things: a glance, a frown, a reference, etc. that add to one's appreciation of the show. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of moments that are positively spine-tingling in West Wing that still retain a great deal of power after repeat viewings. Bartlet's limo ride to the MS press conference, for one. Yet there is something more that Sports Night has to offer, even if it's difficult to define.

I could talk to you about the performers, or the dialogue, or the camerawork and direction, but, honestly, both shows share the same general parameters. I hope that this convinces some of you to at least give this show a chance. It is well worth it.",1131667200,23,4303,4.702917771883289

In this series and in The West Wing, Aaron Sorkin's other major creation of which I'm aware (there had better not be another Aaron Sorkin show lurking out there being awesome without me), the dialog is fast and humorous, and the punchlines are delivered deadpan.  The episodes leave you wanting more, and they tie together pretty well.  The 22-minutes go by very quickly.  They used annoying devices in the first season like a laugh track and ""to be continued"" endings (the work of network suits, no doubt), but they drop those things after a while and find a unique style that works.

A Comedy that isn't, Sports Night will give you big belly laughs while at the same time provoking meaningful thought.
Raising such issues as steroid use and the Confederate Flag, Sorkin manages to input plenty of substance into his comedy, whilst keeping the atmosphere light and very watchable.
There are plenty of similarities between Sorkin's later work of ""The West Wing"" and Sports Night and although the similarities are noticeable, it doesn't make watching Sports Night any less enjoyable for fans of The West Wing.
My only critique would be how much the laugh track seems out of place on the show, especially in the early episodes.  Still that's a minor issue that results from the uniqueness of Sorkin's writing and in the end doesn't detract from a really great series.",1124409600,,882,5.0

A lot of the show revolved around personal lives, unrequited love, separating those personal lives and Sports Night. The show had a hard time figuring out whether it was going to be a comedy or drama, which was odd for it being 30 minutes long. After two seasons, it bit the dust.

The best media comparison I can make is to the screwball comedies -- think Clark Gable/Catherine Hepburn/Spencer Tracy movies with great crazy characters hurling fabulous lines at each other at a breakneck pace. Just put it in the modern setting of a live nightly sport news show.

1777104,4,B00006IRH9,"I missed ""Sports Night"" during it's 2 year run, but I bought this Boxed Set just to see what Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme were doing before ""West Wing"".  I see all kinds of reviews here fawning all over Sports Night, most of them awarding the title ""Best Show You Didn't Watch"" to the show.

The show is good, even worth dropping 30 or 40 bucks on a show ""you didn't watch"".  On it's best episodes Sports Night is INCREDIBLY good - but the ""best"" episodes are mixed in with many that are little more than prime-time soap operas.

Almost every character gets a romantic interest - or two - over the course of the two seasons, and I was frankly bored by a lot of it.  The epitome was the ""will they or won't they"" atmosphere that surrounded the characters of producer Dana (played by Dangerous Housewive's Felicity Huffman) and anchor Casey (Six Feet Under's Peter Krause).

The famous Sorkin dialogue is often in evidence as the characters swagger through their make-believe world bolstered by language witty beyond reality.  The show is best when the characters get to show off their passion.  Joshua Malina (later on Sorkin's West Wing) gets many of these passionate speeches, beginning with one of the best speeches I've ever heard about why hunting is not very ""sporting"".

These characters have principles, but they're also flawed and funny.  Out of 45 episodes only about a dozen are superlative.  In fairness, the ""worst"" episodes are as good as anything I've seen on most prime-time programming, but I wouldn't say it is at all accurate to claim  Sports Night is ""as good as West Wing"".

1777106,5,B00006IRH9,"Fans of ""The West Wing"" are almost sure to love ""Sports Night"". Fans of sports are almost sure to love ""Sports Night"". People in general are almost sure to love ""Sports Night"".

Yes, Aaron Sorkin's first comedy, which was loved by critics but canceled by ABC after only two seasons, has its drawbacks. The laugh track that was forced on the show by ABC executives for half of the first season is jarring, and makes these early episodes much less enjoyable. The dialogue is often repetitive, and Sorkin seems to have a limited number of ideas and themes roaming around in his head - viewers of the West Wing will recognize familiar plots, character names, and even lines of dialogue! But ultimately, the show triumphs because of its wonderful characters.

The friendship between the show's two sports anchors, Dan and Casey, is one of the best relationships ever seen on TV. Like all great partnerships, they have their share of problems, but ultimately the two of them truly love each other, as is revealed throughout both seasons. Casey (played by Peter Krause of ""Six Feet Under""), who at the start of the series has just been divorced from his wife, Lisa, is the star of Sports Night - a fact that Dan has considerable issues with. Dan (played by Josh Charles of ""The Dead Poet's Society"") is the emotional heart of the series, and receives some of the most touching and dramatic plotlines during both seasons. Dana (played by Felicity Huffman, now on ""Desperate Housewives""), producer of Sports Night, is a woman who is strong in her professional life but emotionally weak when it comes to her personal life. Her fierce love for the show and the people who work on it is inspiring. Her ""will they or won't they"" relationship with Casey is a running theme throughout the series, much like Josh and Donna on ""The West Wing"". Natalie (played by Sabrina Lloyd) is Dana's second in command, and her best friend. Her relationship with Jeremy (played by Joshua Malina, now on ""The West Wing"") provides some of the funniest and most touching moments of the show. Jeremy is the show's moral center, and gets some of the best ""Sorkinesque"" speeches. Joshua Malina is excellent in this role, able to be both incredibly funny and incredibly touching at the same time. Isaac (played by Robert Guillame) is the executive producer of Sports Night, and serves as a sort of father figure for the Sports Night group (much like Martin Sheen on the West Wing). When Guillame suffered a stroke in real life, it was written into the show, and the result is some amazing television. Even minor characters, who aren't in the credits but appear in every episode, are well rounded. Guest stars don't appear for one episode and then disappear - they appear many times, sometimes in both seasons, are talked about when they aren't there, and effect the show's characters in real ways. Both seasons feature some great guest stars, including William H. Macy (Huffman's husband) as a ratings advisor brought in to help the show, and Teri Polo as Rebecca, Dan's love interest. Many guest stars later show up on the West Wing - including Janel Moloney, who guest stars in the show's touching Christmas episode.

The DVD set is visually appealing, but ultimately disappointing. It's presented very nicely: the box set holds 3 separate DVD cases; each DVD case contains two disks. Each disk is decorated with the silhouette face of one of the main cast members, and the menu on that disk features that cast member's scenes from the show. Unfortunately, you can't play individual episodes - the disk allows you to ""play all"", or to choose an episode, but once the episode is done the disk goes on to the next episode instead of returning to the menu. The DVD set offers no special features, and mine skipped a few times, even when it was brand new.

Even with these drawbacks, I highly recommend the Sports Nights DVDs. The characters are easy to fall in love with, and when you reach the end of the second season you will be desperately wishing for more.",1110758400,12,4023,4.734664764621969
1777107,5,B00006IRH9,"I just finished watching the entire run of Sports Night and was devestated when it ended.  The same feeling one gets after reading a great book and realizing the journey is over.

I could go on and on about the average viewers intelligence (I am also a huge Arrested Development fan) but I think that is an easy route to take because the writing was so crisp, the swing from tears to laughter so quick that it is inevitable that some people who just want to be entertained would be quick to dismiss it.  Plus it just makes me sound superior to offer that as an excuse which is not the case.

I don't think it is just a coincidence that Sports Night and Arrested Development are produced by the same people. Both don't have a laugh track (although Sports Night started with one and talk about out of place).  Sports Night was simply brilliant and probably does not adhere to a comedy or a drama.  It would've developed it own niche.  If I had to compare it to show I believe it would be along the lines of MASH.

I have to lay the blame soley on ABC.  They botched it by not advertising what it really was.  I believe women in particular would've been turned off by the title.  Moving it from night to night and missing weeks at a time did not help.

Peter Krause has always been one of my favorite television actors, being that he is a very versatile actor, being able to fit in with this show's humorous atmosphere, but also excelling in the more thought-provoking yet morose undertones in Six Feet Under.  Imagine where this show could have gone.  Would Dan get back with Rebecca?  Would Dana and Casey ever get together?  How would Sports Night be under new ownership?

Unlike West Wing, Sports Night does not often delve into political issues.  It is a comedy about people and the situations they get into. If you are turned off by West Wing, don't automatically dismiss this show: I don't like West Wing but love Sports Night.

A thinking person's TV comedy is a rarity to find.  Most comedies dumb down to the audience. Sports Night does not yet is able to make me laugh at every turn. Think the mental level of Wilson Wilson (Home Improvement) under a deadline, and you have an episode of a show known as Sports Night.

The cast of fresh faces have since shown that they had what it took to make a good show. The constantly stressed out Dana was played by Desperate Housewives Felicity Huffman.  Peter Krause's Casey McCall has gone on to win a SAG for his work in Six Feet Under.  Joshua Malina of West Wing also stars.

From excellent pacing to a wonderful cast this is one series I watched on first run, rerun and now DVD.  The cast was tight, and well developed.  You feel like you know them as they slowly show the people behind the personalities without having to take the viewer to 'serious dramatic scenes in a restaurant/bar'.  When they needed to spice up the show and William Macy joined the cast, the producers managed to avoid jumping the shark and instead used the opportunity to enrich the show. Sorkin was also able to incorporate Robert Guillaume's stroke without turning the show into a pity party.

I like this show so much that when I saw it on sale at the local store, I bought it before I even checked the price.(On a student budget I don't make a habit of doing this).  Looking at other DVD boxed sets, how many can you buy for under 50 dollars and get over 2 seasons worth of episodes?

Unlike many boxed sets, with Sports Night you won't burn out watching the same episodes over and over simply because you get so many for your price (45).  For this reason alone I would recommend it.

1777111,5,B00006IRH9,"My husband had been trying to get me to watch this set of DVD's for as long as I can remember.  We rented them through Netflix, and I have to say I am a little depressed that such a great show was cancelled after only two seasons.  We've been hanging on to the last DVD because we just don't want to admit that it's over.  I am going to surprise my husband by buying the boxed set for him for Christmas.  However, I know that I will enjoy them as well.  I would recommend this show for ANYONE -- not just sports fans or West Wing fans, etc......ANYONE!",1099353600,8,552,4.074074074074074
1777112,3,B00006IRH9,"I tuned into this show by accident one time when it was on the air, and what caught my attention was Sabrina Lloyd (""Hey!  That's the chick from Sliders!"")  I couldn't remember the time or channel it was on, so I never caught the show again.

Later the DVD set came out, and as you can see Amazon's site has been flooded with countless rave reviews with scores of 5/5.  This rekindled my interest, but since I wasn't willing to buy a box set based on user reviews alone, I hoped to be able to rent it.  Unfortunately, no local Blockbuster rented out this relatively-unknown series, and none of my friends had even heard of it.  Recently, I joined Zip.ca (similar to Netflix in the U.S.) and I was finally able to rent out the first disc in the series.

I must say that this series is psycho-crazy & busy!  I've never seen a TV show that tried to cram in so many sub-plots into a 22 minute-per-episode series.  The worst of it is in the first 3 episodes, which quite literally gave me a headache to watch.  It was incredibly difficult to follow what was going on, as the pace was incredibly fast - too fast for my poor brain to process.  The craziness reminded me of when I tried to watch the very first episode of The West Wing, which after 20 minutes I changed the channel and have never watched the show again.

Anyway, the second episode of Sports Night is the most difficult to follow... Dan is accused of taking a pro-drug view (I think?), but the origins of this view are cloudy.  Did he say it in the magazine?  Did he say it while on the air the day before?  They practically skipped over this entire prologue and went straight to talk about the consequences.  Then there's Sabrina Lloyd's character (Natalie) who starts whoozing over another character named ""Jeremy"" (I hadn't realized that she was talking about the nerdy guy at that point - was I supposed to have memorized his name after the first episode?)  This craziness in the first few episodes is not the right thing to do so early in the series as it doesn't help in grabbing new viewers.

Fortunately, things start to settle down by the middle of the 3rd episode and begin to form a much more cohesive storyline from the 4th episode and onward.  The episodes start to stitch together beginning with Natalie's brush with sexual harrasment from a football ""star"" (was he real or fiction?  I don't watch sports so I have no idea...)

Despite the fact that the episodes were getting better (and I'm sure discs 2-6 also reflect this improvement), I can understand why the show was cancelled.  You can't name a show ""Sports Night"" and expect to have many different demographics tuning in.  As I mentioned, the only reason the show caught my attention was because Sabrina Lloyd was on the screen at the same time I flipped to the channel.  However, my infatuation with her has worn off considerably since Sliders first aired almost 10 years ago (where is she now?)

I suppose if you love the West Wing, you'll love this show as it has that same crazy/busy style.  If you can't stand the West Wing, avoid this DVD set (which is getting to be hard to find anyway as it's not exactly a best seller).  I'm sure I'll get flamed for ""tainting"" this review list filled with 5/5 ratings, but hey I gave it a fair 3/5 as the series was starting to show potential in the middle of the first disc.  I may even rent the rest of the discs sooner or later, but it will most likely be later as I've got many other TV series to check out from Zip.ca.",1097366400,9,3497,4.404984423676012

(If you're still left wanting, the show attracted enough talented fans that not one but two well-written and funny series of followup ""episodes"" can be found online.)

Take one genuinely gifted writer and show-runner, six terrific actors, and a joyously flagrant disregard for the traditional boundaries between comedy and drama, and you end up with ""Sports Night.""

The only complaint I have is that the DVDs contain the versions with the laugh track.  When the show was originally shown, it was without a laugh track.  This was good.  I hate laugh tracks, and especially when this show isn't quite a sitcom, it just really grates.  When the show was rerun, some idiot thought adding a laugh track would dumb it down enough that it might do better in the rating.  That person was wrong.  Very, very wrong.  Unfortunately, like I said, the laugh track version is the version they chose to put on the DVDs.  I wish they'd not done that.
With that complaint, I give it 4 stars.  The DVDs are otherwise excellent, just as the show is excellent.  If they hadn't had the laugh track or had the option of with or without, I would give it 5 stars.",1088985600,21,915,4.286549707602339

If you enjoyed the writing on West Wing for the first few seasons, but are not a big sports fan buy this collection anyway.  You really don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this show, because it's more about the people who make the show than it is about the content of the show they are making.  You will also notice quite a few similarities between the two shows.",1087862400,5,720,4.4393939393939394

Give it a chance, get to know the characters, Dan and Casey, the on-air talent, Jeremy, the stats guy, Dana, the savvy producer, Natalie, her competent assistant (my crush), and Issac, the seasoned executive producer. The episodes guest staring William H. Macy, the ratings consultant, have some of the best scenes in television history. The genius of Sorkin's dialogue is communicating what is not said.
The only warning that I have for those of you who haven't experienced Sports Night...is be prepared to be disappointed in the final episode because that is when the show was just getting its legs. It's a shame that this show got cut down in the prime of its life.",1087257600,2,1018,4.890173410404624
1777118,5,B00006IRH9,"I do not own the DVD boxed set but caught as many episodes as i could during a bout of insomnia when it was aired on Comedy Central. I must admit here however, that i only watch 2 of the 4 major sports on TV (football and hockey... basically the more injured someone can get, the more entertaining it is). Given thati usually only watch the finals of each series. I was just too lazy to change the channel when Sports Night came on though, and i am glad.
The characters and humor were wonderful. I wondered why i couldn't see it anymore. I think, if ABC screwed it up, and comedy central showed it too late, perhaps NBC should pick it up in their Thursday night line-up. The plot was easy to see, but the characters were the driving force. Heck, i started seeing it as ""Friends"" but with a studio instead of a Coffee Shop.

I'm amazed at how wonderfully written this show was, and how well the chararcters were thought out.  I always liked how in the tough times Isaac could always give his wisdom, and it seemed to always make things better for the staff at Sports Night.
Aaron Sorkin is a brilliant writer, and I'm hoping that he'll create more new shows that can at least compare to the intelligent writing of Sports Night.  Anyone looking for an entertaining, quality TV show, should definitley check out Sports Night.",1084752000,3,767,4.659259259259259

I was up late one night and caught an episode and was instantly grabbed by its unique style and keen intellect. I purchased the set from Amazon.com after watching The West Wing Season 1 on DVD and instantly fell in love with Aaron Sorkin's writing. It will truly grip you. You will become attached to the characters as you watch them work and deal with a number of complex social and personal problems. You will honestly laugh and cry in the same episode. Perhaps the best part of the show is the way it constantly surprises you, not with cheap storylines which are cliched, but with the plot turns these characters face not only in each episode, but more so over the course of the whole set. The only regret I have is that there are only 2 seasons. This show really is a masterpiece, and I'm not one easily won over.

1777121,5,B00006IRH9,"[I rate it 4.5 stars.]
""Sports Night"" is about an eponymous fictitious hour sports news show on the fictitious Continental Sports Channel.  It's a sit-com targeted at an audience who knows what ""eponymous"" means without consulting a dictionary.  But this comedy isn't really about sports at all.  It's about intelligent, articulate people who use humor to relieve the pressures that their demanding jobs entail.
Aaron Sorkin is the creator of ""Sports Night"".  He also created ""The West Wing"" a year later, and when he realized that it was a lot easier selling viewers a fictitious White House administration than a fictitious sports news crew, he dropped ""Sports Night"" like a hot potato.  Most everyone knows that ""The West Wing"" isn't really about Washington politics; instead it's about intelligent, articulate people who use humor to relieve the pressures that their demanding jobs entail.  But few people have even heard of ""Sports Night"".  It's a shame, though, because ""Sports Night"" may be the funniest show you never watched.
There are plenty of valid criticisms of ""Sports Night"".  For supposedly intelligent people the characters adopt a large number of unreasonable prejudices.  These are all politically correct prejudices, of course.  In the world of ""Sports Night"" when a homeless man flicks open a switchblade he's only cutting a sandwich to share.  Aaron Sorkin certainly has trouble writing multiple character voices.  Without seeing which characters recite which lines you'd be hard pressed to match characters with dialog from a script; the phrasing and delivery are largely interchangeable.  And fully half of the humor of ""Sports Night"" comes from a predictable formula of repetition.  Here's my pastiche of a ""Sports Night"" dialog:
A: ""We need to talk.""
B: ""Is it about X?  Because I'm tired of talking about X.  We can talk about anything you want, as long as it's not about X.""
A: ""OK, then.""
B: ""It's not about X?""
A: ""It's not about X.""
B: ""OK, then.""
A: ""It's about X.""
B: ""I've got to tell you, if I could make your head explode using only the power of my mind, they'd never get the stain out of the carpet.""
""Sports Night"" in its 2-year run won quite a lot of awards, but none of them were from the writing.  It's good that there's still a lot of comic meat left after you strip away the repetition schtick, and much of that comes from the talented cast: Josh Charles (who got his start in John Waters's ""Hairspray), Peter Krause (now in ""Six Feet Under""), Felicity Huffman (""Out of Order""), Joshua Malina (who followed Sorkin to ""The West Wing""), Sabrina Lloyd (""Sliders""), and Robert Guillaume (""Benson"").  But the most significant people on ""Sports Night"" weren't the writers or actors, but rather the impressive crew behind the cameras.  Here are just the award ""Sports Night"" won (skipping the 22 other nominations):
1999 DGA Award, Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series: Thomas Schlamme
1999 Emmy Award, Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series: Janet Ashikaga
1999 Emmy Award, Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series: Thomas Schlamme

2000 TV Guide Award, Best Show You're Not Watching
Do you remember the first episode of ""ER""?  This was ground-breaking television; it pulled you into the story by its technique of using moving cameras to record an action-packed scene in a single continuous piece rather than assemble lots of short cuts together.  It's not surprising that Thomas Schlamme directed several episodes of ""ER"" before bringing this technique to ""Sports Night"".  Continuous action is very expensive to shoot as it requires the sets to be contiguous, the lighting to be in place for all the places the camera will move to, and most importantly all the actors and camera and sound people have to avoid mistakes for the duration of the scene.  But the payoff is a superior viewing experience.  This show really delivered.
I could go on about the great recurring guest cast, with people like Teri Polo, Brenda Strong, William H. Macy, and Jayne Brook.  Or the great music that ends most every episode.  I could tell you that you'll be disappointed by the extras on the DVD collection (none at all).  Or that Sorkin bowed to network pressure and added a laugh track for about half the first season before it became clear that the viewers were people who didn't need a laugh track to get the jokes.  But the most important thing I can tell you is that you really should check out ""Sports Night"".  Despite its several flaws it got many things right.  ""Sports Night"" is good entertainment.",1083456000,150,4981,5.053789731051345
1777122,5,B00006IRH9,"Like many of the other reviewers, I did not see this show when it first aired.  Mostly because I could never find it, because it never seemed to air when it was supposed to.  This should have aired on ESPN!
I really enjoyed watching the box set and only wish there were more episodes to look forward to, as the series only came to a ""semi-end"" when the (imaginary)  network was bought out.

1777124,5,B00006IRH9,"They say you should never talk about politics and religion at the office. The characters of SPORTS NIGHT tackle religion, politics and much, much more on this great and eternally underrated TV show (marketed as a standard comedy sitcom but is much more complex, probably had the wrong original audience).
With a mix of characters ranging from the elderly and very (albeit grudgingly) fatherly managing editor played by Robert Guillume, to the neurotic executive producer played by Felicity Huffman, the shy and tightly wound pair of associate producers (Josh Molina and Sabrina Lloyd) to the two byumbling but not superficial anchors of Peter Krause and Josh Charles. You can't get a better conglamoration of characters or better actors to play them with the right amount of comedy and splendor this side of ""The West Wing"".
From a slow news day to personal feelings about ethics in sports as well as the role sports play in society this show covers them all in conjunction with the everyday office gossip, problems with management and interpersonal relationships. That this show is still funny and smart at the same time is a true testament to the writing skills of Aaron Sorkin.
Notable guest appearences include Peter Reigert, John de Lancie (for all you Star Trek fans) and William H. Macy (who is married in real life to Felicity Huffman).

...but I think it's safe to say that if you watch this show, you will care about it. You'll care so deeply you'll feel a pang of pain in your heart when you think how there never will be another episode, how this specific ensemble will never be back together, and how a show that could've been one of the greats never got out of the sophomore slump (even Cheers got 3 seasons to establish itself before getting decent ratings!).
You don't need extras on this DVD, you'll be fine with the ""play all"" feature, because watching this show from end to end is the most we could ask from television.",1077235200,2,897,4.345238095238095
1777126,5,B00006IRH9,"First, a disclaimer. I happen to work in the television industry,
so I probably see more in this show than the average viewer.
That having been said, I would recommend this box set to anyone who wanted to see truly incredible comedy, witty dialog, characters you WILL care about, and writing that should have its own category in the Emmy Awards. From the rapid-fire joke delivery, to the character development that begins in the pilot and never stops, to the drama intertwined with all, this has to be one of the best shows ever to grace ABC's lineup. (It is truly unfortunate that ABC chose to move it around; that this show was killed by such treatment should be ample evidence to ABC that such show-shuffling is A Bad Idea If You Want To Build Audience Loyalty.)
An aside to one of the other reviewers who wanted the cast members to come back to do a proper ending to the series; I have to say that, having lived through a situation very similar to the anguish that was central to the last two episodes, I can think of no better ending. The last five minutes of Episode 45 brought tears of joy to my eyes, just to know that their pain ended on such a happy note. It should stand as it is.
We've seen some of the other actors in other roles recently (notably Sabrina Lloyd, Joshua Malina, Peter Krause, and Felicity Huffman), and have heard Robert Guillaume (for whom I have nothing but admiration) as voice talent in the new Lion King movie, but I will always treasure sharing Continental Sports Channel and ""Sports Night"" with them.

This is such a great series, probably one of the best I had the fortune of watching (first DVD boxset too).  The acting and the witty dialogue is just a beginning to the brillence that is Sports Night.  It can pull emotions out of you that you never knew you had and cover topics that shouldn't even be funny or dramatic.

There are few things about the show you should know before you decide to buy the boxed set:
-You will laugh (and cry) hard
-You will (and I mean this) care about the characters
-You will go into withdrawal after you finish the 45th episode
-You will agonize that it was cancelled

1777129,5,B00006IRH9,"For those that might see this title come up while searching for the West Wing DVD, I fully recommend this amazing box set.  The characters, plotlines and dialog are brought to life with such a glow, a special X factor, that you can't help but be engrossed.  I have to say that if this show had been given the chance that Cheers had received when it was tanking in its' first few seasons, I know that this would be one of the most watched TV shows on ABC.
There are few shows that give the viewer a real palpable sense of satisfaction simply by watching them.  Something beyond a woman picking a husband on TV, or cops solving a mystery.  Sports Night is TV at its finest.  The characters are intelligent, and they exude a vulnerability that allows the viewer to be saddened by their struggles as well as revel in their triumphs.
This show has an exuberance and zest for itself that makes you care about it.  A wit and style that make you see the characters as multi-dimentional, not just cardboard, static stereotypes. Aaron Sorkin took Sports Center and gave it a soul.  Gave it something special that the viewers never see.  Then he brought it to everyone.  You do NOT have to like sports at all to enjoy this show.  Just don't be surprised when you find yourself caring about men climbing a mountain or a pitcher throwing a no hitter, because it's all seen through the wonderfully human eyes of the characters.
In short, this show is at the top of it's game when it's funny, as well as dramatic.  It's just a shame that ABC didn't know how to market that.",1073174400,4,1558,4.4125874125874125

I agree with the other reviewer who said the ABC exec who cancelled this show should be shot. If the networks realized that *long-term* financial gain is actually a good thing, and often can only come via word of mouth promotion, they might actually give a show like this a chance.
The reason I never watched it myself when it was on the air, was that I thought it was ""a show about sports"". (I'm a sports fan, by the way, just not a fan of dopey sit-coms.) I clearly remember some ads in the NYC subway which conveyed to me: ""Another stupid TV comedy, but this one's about sports."" I put a lot of blame on ABC's marketing department for the show's cancellation.

This show is incredible and is a must for people who love great television.  What I love about this show is the continuity from one episode to the next, which is something most 1/2 hour shows lack - they restart every week as if the last week never happened.  This show allows you to follow these characters and you actually care about them.  Watching these dvds is like reading a book you can't put down.  I finished the entire set within a few days and found myself quite saddened when I reached the last disc and knew there would be no more after this.  The last line of the series said it best, something along the lines of ""Sports Night is a great show.  If you can't make money out of it, you shouldn't be in the money-making business"".

Yes, the programming exec that decided the fate of ""Sports Night"" should be taken out back and shot.  But what makes this ""good show"" so great is how all the great pieces come together to make such a moving piece of television history.  The show was not without flaws, but it worked through them.  The changes between the pilot and the next episode were incredible!  The whole ""dramady"" thing obviously created a lot of anxiety about how to use a laugh track or whether to use one at all.  After overuse in the pilot, the laugh track was slowly disolved more and more into the background.  Thankfully.  I know I didn't need to hear any fake laughter to rattle my funnybone!  And the almost maniacal Jeremy and Natalie (and a few others) were toned down appropriately from the pilot for the rest of the series.  I love movies and TV shows with great characters, and this show made me care about its characters remarkably quickly.  I heard that Aaron Sorkin had a deal to recreate the show on Showtime but ABC stepped in to prevent it.  So, the network not only knocked out the show, it pulled the plug on its life support.

I would think that they would take a show that isn't doing so well of the air.
Anyway, the show is a great mix of seriousness and humor. Every episode had a plot and all 45 episodes were perfectly sequenced. The thing about this show is you have to watch the episodes in order. Even though you could watch one episode and understand what was going on, you would watch all 45 episodes and see a stroy from beginning to end. From the endless love between Casey and Dana to the ratings of the show from start to finish. I also noticed that even though the show went off the air. It did leave an opening to come back for another season. So I am assuming that when the writers wrote it they weren't 100% sure that they were going to end.
But the one thing I think you should take notice from in this show is the humor and sarcasm from the show's Executive Producer Isaac Jaffe. He is the epidomy of what a boss should be, his wit and humor make this show one of the best I have ever seen. I say buy it and watch it from start to finish. It will only take 14 hours with breaks and changing discs included. lol Anyway I give this show the greatest rating in the world.",1069545600,,1442,4.063157894736842
1777136,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night was a show that, despite its quality, never seemed to find its audience.  Though it aired on a major network with decent publicity, the public largely ignored this superb show, writing it off as a show about sports.  I am embarrassed to say that I was part of that ignoring public.
Visiting the show later in reruns on Comedy Central, I came to understand why this show was almost universally praised by critics: Sports Night is, through and through, one of the most tightly crafted shows to ever hit the airwaves.
Sports Night focuses on a fictional sports show with the same name, broadcast nightly on a third-place cable sports station, and hosted by two intelligent, witty men who put up good appearances on the air, but who are each struggling with their own demons behind the scenes.  Added to the mix are a domineering executive producer (brilliantly portrayed by Felcity Huffman), as well as a cast of neurotic characters, all anchored by the sanity of Isaac, played by Robert Guillaume.
What makes Sports Night so incredibly watchable is the accessability of the show to any type of viewer, sports fan or not.  In fact, the sports references are kept to a minimum, as the show--like The Larry Sanders Show--focuses more on what happens behind the scenes.
The dialogue is extraordinarily snappy, and moves along at a rhythmic clip that is almost melodic in nature.  It's a banter whose music rivals that of the best David Mamet scripts.
Perhaps the only mistep Sports Night made was the inclusion of a laugh track early on in the show.  Not only was this extremely obvious as canned laughter, it also seemed out of place, as this is not a comedy with dramatic elements, but rather a drama with a hint of comedy every now and then.
Sports night is a true gem.",1069027200,10,1779,4.685897435897436

The cast is smart and energetic and the writing is vintage Sorkin with witty reparte ruling the day.

From the witty writing to the incredible acting and chemistry between the actors and characters, Sports Night can't get much better.  I also highly approve of the fact that it does not make much use out of a laugh track, as that would just get in the way of the quick lines that play perfectly off of one another.

Everyone is wonderful.  It is a shame that it was cancelled.  I really think it had the potential of becoming a stronger show and maybe get moved to an hour instead of only being a half hour long.

When it started on ABC in 1998, not many people knew what it was about -- is it a comedy or drama or is it a satire on sports? Well, I can say it doesn't belong to any one category. It doesn't matter what category Sports Night belongs in; it is just an excellent show, and that's all that matters. What makes this short-lived show great was the great acting by every single cast member. My favs were Josh Charles who played Dan and Joshua Malina who played Jeremy, but every cast members gave unforgettable performance in each of the 45 episodes.

The only problem with this show is that the characters all have the same personality.  I feel that people in this profession (Sports newscasters and production team) would all have had the same interests, but not have to have the same sarcatic joke-cracking personalities.  It is fun to watch but it takes away from the over-all feeling of the show.  I want to love these characters (and I do) but they are all the same.  It's very hard to pick a favorite.
The show does posess many heart-touching moments and keeps you interested from beginning to end, male or female.  That is the best aspect of the show.  Aaron Sorkin has taken something that is supossed to appeal to a male dominant audience and made if so it is non-gender specific.

1777148,4,B00006IRH9,"'Sports Night' is a show which will always polarize the viewers who watch it.  It is a dramedy is some ways not unlike 'Ally McBeal' (when it was at its best) with clever and witty (yet oftentimes precious) dialogue and a very distinctive style which refuses to compromise itself.  Its characters are complicated and realistically frustrating in their hectic and wishy-washy personal lives and romantic realtionships. It may have been pushed as a comedy from the start, but (as the rather awkward and hesitant laugh track for much of the first season highlights) 'Sports Night' makes it very clear each episode that the main objective of every script is not to be laugh out loud funny, but to develop characters and relationships in a unique setting and with a unique perspective.  This isn't to say the show is not humorous, with its often endearingly quirky characters and situations and rapid-fire Aaron Sorkin brand(TM) of dialogue which may occasionally be too circular (and thus trying), but more often than not produces some wonderful punch lines and triumphant speeches whose poetic energy most viewers cannot help but be swept up in.  Knowledge of sports is not a prerequisite, as the symbolism of sport related stories the show mentions but does not dwell on and the passion these people have for both athletics and their work reporting the news offers character development and surprising poignancy.  As for the oft-talked about dialogue, repeated back-to-back viewings do highlight the fact that Sorkin tends to have his characters talk an awful lot while saying rather less  - his trademark fast-paced and repetitive dialogue is alternatively invigorating and aggravating.  It's very stylized, distinctive and often realistic writing, but it can get redundant at times.
This show's casting was sublime, headed by Josh Charles and Peter Krause portraying two highly likeable, complicated and passionate sports anchors.  The rest of the main cast, rounded out by the excellent Felicity Huffman and Robert Guillaume as well as Sabrina Lloyd and Joshua Malina inhabit characters who are eminently watchable, even as they struggle to conquer their own faults and everything from poor ratings to network pressure, personal tragedy and women named Sally.  Effortless performances and unique, intelligent writing powered this series, and elevate it above mere cult status or a footnote in the careers of people who have and will go on to bigger things.  Though a couple storylines in the last half of season 2 are not entirely up to par, the show thankfully has an agreeable finale which provides enough closure to dampen the sting of a premature cancellation by ABC.
The DVD is bare-bones, with 7 or 8 episodes per disc and chapter stops at the beginning of each episode.  The picture and sound quality is very good, and highlight the award-winning technical prowess with which every episode was crafted.
Indeed, this show has received an enormous amount of critical praise, for rarely is television's writing so focused, so smartly realized onscreen and so refreshingly different.

People may turn to this show because it's from the same creators as The West Wing. It's better than that show in my opinion.  Imagine the West Wing without the politics or the  pontificating; with only the humor, cameraderie and heart. That is what Sports Night is. And yes it does help a bit to be a sports fanatic to appreciate some of the more esoteric points of the show (which is after all about a bunch of sports-crazed people producing a sports news show) but you can be a sports hater and it still wouldn't matter.

When I heard that ABC had cancelled it after only two seasons, I was heartbroken.  This show has SOUL!  It's also got six disks, and I watch them constantly.  By the time you finish the sixth disk, and the final episodes of the second season, you're completely ready to start all over again.
I don't know how Sorkin does it, but after watching a few shows of Sports Night, you will fall in love with these characters.  You won't be able to wait to finish the two seasons, and trust me -- you'll wish ABC had realized their goof in letting this one get away.  I really think the only reason this show didn't do well in the ratings was due to it's scheduling problems (ABC slung in around to at least a dozen different time slots).  It might be a dream, but I'd love to see these characters come together to finish the series in a more satisfying way -- Peter Krause is in Six Feet Under, Josh Malina is ""Will Bailey"" on The West Wing,  Sabrina Lloyd on ""Ed,"" Felicity Huffman on ""Frasier"" and some new series on Showtime.

1777159,5,B00006IRH9,"... When ""Sports Night"" first aired, I assumed it was a show about sports and didn't watch it.
I knew of Josh Charles from ""Threesome,"" which didn't endear me to him, and I'd not really heard of Peter Krause. I thought Felicity Huffman probably wasn't as talented as William H. Macy, her husband. And I thought that Robert Guillaume was a has-been, rather than a still-viable talent. I thought the repeat appearances by Ted McGinley meant the show was as low quality as his other projects. I thought that the show was an ESPN-fused ""Murphy Brown"" wannabe, and I didn't watch it.
I was wrong. I was really, really wrong. I was so massively wrong about ""Sports Night"" that, should they invent and introduce a time machine, I would go back to Fall 1998, sit my then-self down in front of a TV and force me to indulge in this quick-paced, witty masterpiece of a show. It's got comedy, drama, well-developed characters capable of incredible depth and great, great acting.
Some shows in the series were so good, so compelling that I wept openly. The friendships portrayed were realistic and touching. The relationships were both daffy and affecting.

1777160,5,B00006IRH9,"The proof of the pudding for the value of ""Sports Night"" is probably the fact that my wife, who usually refrains from attending sporting events with me and invariably walks out of the room if I turn on Sports Center, loved ""Sports Night.""  This Aaron Sorkin creation aired for roughly two seasons worth of episodes between 1998-2000, and it provides the same sort of witty repartee and verbal sparring that we get on ""The West Wing,"" albeit without the political overtones that make it a hit or miss with the ideological sensibilities of the viewer.  On this show the outrage comes out of the casual dismissal of Babe Ruth as the athlete of the century, if you are really concerned about such things, but mostly this show is about the glories of frustration.

On one level the frustration comes from the wonderful and wacky world of being the 3rd rated 11 p.m.cable  sports news show, where live prize fights do not go as long as planned and a newly signed baseball free agent disses the Big Apple in an interview.  This is a world where how to stretch a story 15 seconds to the next commercial break raises the distinct possibility of destroying lives or at least careers, but not as much as the grim possibility that the network will be bought by somebody who will immediately kill off the show.  Unlike ""Murphy Brown,"" the most obvious fictional show to bring up for comparison, such crises might be a source of biting humor but they are not comic situations.

But more importantly there are the love lives of the main characters, which produce considerably more frustration on the part of the viewers.  Casey McCall (Peter Krause), the anchor on the right is recently divorced and has strong feelings for producer Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman), who reciprocates them.  However, these feelings do nothing to preclude the couple from putting every obstacle possible in their way.  Dan Rydell (Josh Charles), the anchor on the left, falls for Rebecca Wells (Terri Polo), who he learns is not only married to a jerk, but interesting trying to work things out with him (the jerk, not Dan).  Then there is Natalie Hurley (Sabrina Lloyd), the associate producer, who waits with pretty much no patience for Jeremy Goodwin (Joshua Malina), the walking encyclopedia of sports and other trivial matters, to notice that he is smitten by her.

Overlooking both areas of frustration is Isaac Jaffe (Robert Guillaume), the font of all wisdom and chief buffer with the CSC network, even if he does not always understand what his young charges are complaining about at any given moment.  But when Isaac says something, like when he tells Dan that he loves him, but that he is never going to be impressed by a young white man comparing himself to Jackie Robinson.  ""Sports Night"" is one of those works were you need to remember that God is in the details.  Example: When Isaac gives Dana tickets to see ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, she returns all excited and quotes the lines of the character who summons all the animals; Robert Guillaume did the voice of Rafiki in the 1994 movie.  So be open to deep and hidden meanings when you work your way through these six DVDs.

If you actually have a true appreciation for sports and if breaking a world's record or remembering the career of a forgotten sports figure have deep personal meaning for you, then ""Sports Night"" is an even richer tapestry.  But the chief charm here is the verbiage flying back and forth at high speed (it does for the half-hour sit-com what ""Moonlighting"" did for the hour long sit-com in that regard).  I only caught a few of these episodes the first time around, when those who cared about the quality of network programming were screaming that a show worthy of praise was going down the tubes, and I knew it was good, but I did not know that it was this good.  Oh, and if we are making suggestions for vastly under-appreciated and greatly lamented television shows that should be released in their entirety on DVD, I want to vote for Hugh Wilson's ""Frank's Place.""

1777161,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night is one of my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time. It is probably the second best-true 'dramedy' ever (""The Wonder Years"" being the first in my opinion.)
Three things make this show one of television's best ever. The first and foremost is the dialogue writing. Throughout the whole DVD boxed set, one can count the physical jokes on one hand. In this show, the humor is in the dialogue, and it is very fast paced and very witty. Because of this, the writers of ""Sports Night"" are not limited to typical sitcom rhythm.
The second great thing about 'Sports Night' is that, for the most part, the plot is driven by the characters rather than by the situation. In the strictest sense of the word, I wouldn't call 'Sports Night' a sitcom. This is a show about people dealing with their problems such as intra-office romance, competition, loneliness, illness, uncertainties, and various other neuroses.
Third, I was really impressed with the acting on the show especially that of Josh Charles (Dan) and Peter Krause (Casey). The series has many emotional scenes where I felt that a lesser actor would have not shown the restraint required for the show to remain believable.
Another good thing about this boxed set is that they didn't include a title and theme song with each of the 40+ episodes in the set. The show wasn't meant to have a laugh track, and unfortunately some of the first season episodes have one included. Also I think the fans of the show would have enjoyed some bonus feature material, but unfortunately none were included. But if you're a fan of innovative television, don't let those minor flaws deter you from getting this boxed set. Just be glad that it was released.",1049587200,4,1696,4.694630872483222
1777162,5,B00006IRH9,"Between '98 and '00 I somehow missed the two-season run of Sports Night.  I'm an avid TV watcher, but it somehow slipped beneath my radar, such that I'd barely heard of the show until a couple of months ago.  And this despite the fact that the show won three Emmys!
That's when I learned that one of my favorite TV writers (Aaron Sorkin, The West Wing) had also written this half-hour ""dramedy.""  (I hate that word, but it's better than ""sit-com,"" which doesn't do Sports Night justice.)  I'm such a huge Sorkin fan than when I saw that the (unfortunately short) series run of Sports Night was available on DVD, I bought it without having ever seen a single episode.
And I wasn't disappointed.  While it's clear that with The West Wing Sorkin has polished his dialogue style, it's still unmistakable here: sharp, smart, staccato exchanges between characters, so quick and lively that it makes the characters seem even more intelligent than they are.  It's not exactly realistic, but it's what I WISH reality was.
Like The West Wing, there's a great ensemble cast, too many to list individually.  Most have gone on to other projects.  And like The West Wing, Sports Night has its heart in the right place, as characters struggle with love, friendship, and work.
A great show.  Though the DVD set isn't heavy on special features, it does pack all 45 episodes into six discs and one three-box set.  Well worth the money.",1049068800,23,1417,4.700404858299595

After perusing the available shows and finding nothing that seemed satisfactory, I decided to start into Sports Night.  I was immediatly thrown into the ebb and flow of the witty dialog and found myself laughing as hard as I have at any other sitcom in quite a while.  What a wonderful show.  I'm still in the first season, and can't wait to get to some of the later episodes that I remember (particularly looking forward to the arc with William H. Macy).  Great show, great cast, great dialog, too bad it ended so soon.

As for the laugh-track that others mentioned...that exists because the show was filmed in front of a studio audience during the first season, and was filmed in an empty studio in the second season.  So, you notice, as the series went on, that there's no laugh track in the later episodes.
But take that with a grain of salt, as I've not seen this package yet.  So I can't say for certain that one wasn't added for the 2nd season episodes on the DVD.  But I will know in about 3-4 days!  ;)

I do love West Wing, also Alan Sorkin's work, but Sports Night was my all-time favorite. In view of the current (2002-3) obsession with ""reality shows"", it breaks my heart that a quality program like Sports Night was canceled, especially after such a short run.

An incredible viewing experience. The characters are real people, with faults and high points. The dialogue is true and funny. Try not to cry when Dan ""apologizes"" on the air for a magazine article in which he was quoted. Try not to cheer when Isaac does his on-air editorial on the ""Southern Gentlemen"". Try not to laugh at Natalie's efforts to cure Dan of his writer's block. Try not to be mesmerized by William Macy's scene stealing efforts during the few scenes he had during the series' second season. I'll tell you now that all these are impossible. The writing and acting are just too good.
If you don't like sports... you'll love this show. If you do like sports... you'll treasure every episode.

Only one problem: what's with that PUTRID laugh track?

Also like others, I wore out a few tapes recording and re-recording episodes in the hopes of collecting all of them.  The complete set on DVD is a great, great buy, a peerless addition to any quality-TV lover's collection.
The show itself is absolutely fantastic; every episode is not only consistently funny but also moving - and occasionally goose-bump-inducing - at times.
However, I have a few problems with the DVDs themselves that many others (below) seem to have had...
- stuffing too many episodes on each disc in this ""dual-layer"" format does indeed cause occasional skipping, and initially my high-end DVD player (a Denon) wouldn't even read them.  (A free tune-up by the Denon people has solved the problem for the most part.)
- no extras.  As someone below pointed out, it was quite a long time between the end of the series and the release of these discs - it would have been a nice gift to fans (who are going to be the ones buying this, after all) to have some bonus material - outtakes/deleted scenes are the easy ones, but commentary by the busy Sorkin - the best possible bonus - was probably too much to hope for.

We have been finding it tempting to pull an all-nighter to watch all six DVDs. Since the show was only 30 minutes the time just blows by and with all the commerical breaks deleted it shows you just how well written the episodes are.
The cast of this show were an excellent team and I love the way they play off of each other. We were also surprised at the number of bit parts characters we recognized. The only flaw to this set is the laugh track; although I will compliment the way they left the track out of episodes that clearly were too serious for a laugh track. (I think that was probably done in the original broadcast.)
Sports Night is even better than I remembered. A great combo of comedy and drama (with some slapstick thrown in). I highly recommend this set and for this price you just can't beat it.",1041984000,6,1061,4.2835820895522385

And why does everybody have to be sarcastic & have the traditional ""Tough Guy"" chip-on-their-shoulder?  Everybody!  Why?!  I think its obvious as to why it was cancelled after, like, one season.
I know that very few agree with me, but rent this first, there's a good chance you'll laugh a couple of times, but nothing to justify buying it.  Its not for everybody (obviously).
Its pretty obvious that Aaron Sorkin is unoriginal, as I've even seen an episode of ""The West Wing"" with one of the same character dialogs.

The laugh track is annoying (I don't need to be reminded that this is a funny show), but the worst part is that the disks skip repeatedly.  I'm not sure why they skip, but I suspect it is as a result of pushing too many episodes onto each disk.  At first I thought it was my player, but after trying it on three different players of three brands that were each less than a year old I am forced to conclude it is a product flaw.

""Sports Night"" (courtesy of Aaron Sorkin) always trusted the smarts of its audience. It could show a staccato sequence of verbal insanity between ten people in a control room one moment, then a bitter backstage fight with the show's anchors the next. There have been complaints about the laugh track, but mercifully it was kept to a minumum; at least there weren't any excessive audience howls, as is usually the case with sitcom track, and the track was severely reduced by the second year. One critic complained that it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or drama; that's because it was a ""dramdey-"" though I never really liked that hybrid either.

Sports Night is about a cable sports network that stuggles to compete against the larger companies like ESPN and FOX, while dealing with regular personal problems like office politics, work relationships, and the bonds of friendship. The cast consists of two co-anchors who are long-time friends, a producer that's also a friend of one of the anchors, an editor/boss who keeps getting sucked into his office's soap opera lives while trying to fend off the company's bureaucratic sharks, and two associate producers who have a sweet office romance.  Plus all the supporting technical people.  It's not really a sitcom, nor a full on drama, but kind of in between--a dramedy I guess.

1777201,5,B00006IRH9,"Could this be one of the greatest sitcoms of all time?  Yes!  Sports Night is a show that doesn't talk down to it's audience.  All of the scripts are smart, funny, and touching all at the same time.  All of the actors are great.  From Joshua Charles and Peter Krause (Dan and Casey) down to the guys in the control room, everyone is great.  You don't even have to be a sports fan to appreciate the show.  It is very rare when a television show reaches perfection.  This show did it early and stayed that way through it's woefully short run on prime-time television.",1037577600,,565,4.365384615384615
1777202,5,B00006IRH9,"It amazes me after watching the shows again why this show never took off.  A successful meshing of the best qualities of Northern Exposure and The West Wing, Sports Night presents one of the most dynamic and likable ensemble of characters in the past 10 years of television.  The characters faced real issues and bounced off each other (sometimes literally) in their furious rush to make the most out of their lives.  They are torn between their love for each other, their love of sports and the love they hold for the show they work on.  If only we were all so dedicated to each other and our chosen professions.  If I have any complaints about Sports Night, it simply became formulaic towards the end.  The cyclical and furious rants and conversations between characters really work as you weave about the office, but after a while, you relish a sit-down, straight-faced conversation.  When they do arrive, the messages in them hit home powerfully.  The Christmas episode in Season 1 is one of my favorite shows all-time with poignant messages, amazing dialogue and a touching sentiment that captures the spirit of the season.  I hope people will buy or just rent this series and see how dynamic the writing and character development can be on TV and dream of a time when more sitcoms and dramas can be as interesting as Sports Night was.",1037232000,12,1340,4.716738197424893
1777203,5,B00006IRH9,"I remember catching on to Sports Night at the end of its run and thinking it was a good show, had not seen it sense. So after reading all the reviews bought the set yesterday and I watched the first disk out of 6.  What did I see out of a comedy: a man disillusioned by a divorce and hating the police blotter that has become sports have his faith reborn, a person coming to grips with how he effected his brothers life that lead to a horrible crash causing his death, a female reporter get harassed in the locker room by a star football player and then face him down, a devout non-hunter express his opinion on why he thinks it is wrong and why he caved in and didn't speak up when given the assignment to produce a segment on a hunting show, and how the news of a pitcher from the Negro league got pulled from his car and beaten to death in a car jacking.  Gee I am giving it all away so far.  As well as witty fast paced humor mixed in with the issues that effect the world during the time of the show as well as today.  Some very well written shows with actors that make you believe they care for each other and in the characters they are playing.  Who turns out to be the leader of the 3-Ring circus that is the CSC Sports Show? Robert Guillaume, giving leadership and coming across as a father figure and giving what should be a classic line ""Stupid people surround themselves with smart people. Smart people surround themselves with smart people who disagree with them.""  If this show had been on Cable instead of broadcast television it would probely still be on and thriving today.
The one thing I did not like was the idiotic broadcast laugh track added in to try when you should find something funny.  First it is annoying and is thrown in at interval times.  I find many places in the shows that are quirky and funny and found myself laughing in many places and when the laugh-track came in many times I was sitting there wounding why they hit the button at that point.  A classic example of how the heads of broadcast TV must keep to their formulas that make modern day broadcast TV mostly unwatchable.
A big point for me was over 70 reviews and everyone one of them gave it 5 stars.  That is what helped me to make the final decision to make the purchase.  I am very happy with my purchase so far and can't wait to get back home and see what is going to happen next.",1037059200,,2380,4.220264317180617

Why ABC (and all the networks) couldn't make this a long-term series is beyond my understanding.  When you see what shows we have to watch today, you wonder why we can't be watching new episodes of Sports Night.  Oh well, at least we have these episodes on DVD to watch as we wish.  Don't miss out on this chance to have this fine collection.  It is worth every penny.",1036972800,,533,4.227722772277228
1777205,4,B00006IRH9,"The upside is that one of my favorite TV series ever is now available for DVD.  Even if you aren't a fan of Aaron Sorkin or ""West Wing"", this is one of the series that initiated the kind of comedy that you see a lot of TV sitcoms doing now.  Even the serious episodes have the quick wit and funny banter that the series is famous for.
  The downside is that this DVD set has ONLY the shows.  No extra footage at all.  They had no room after cramming up to 8 episodes per disc.  I would love it if the disc had outtakes, or interviews with the cast, or some commentary from the cast or the crew, like a lot of the other TV series DVDs have, but there's nothing like that on this one.
  Plus they made these DVDs kind of funny.  If you select one episode to watch it will show you that episode, and then continue to show you the rest of the episodes.  Apparently the DVD makers thought that most people would want to see all of the episodes on the DVD because they have a ""play all"" option on every one of them.  As much as I love the show, I don't usually have time to sit there and watch 8 episodes in a row.

  I still gave it 4 stars though.  I only took away one for the downside.  Now that I have this pristine, commercial free DVD set I can throw away all the videotaped recordings I've kept since the show went off the air.",1036972800,2,1329,3.9923954372623576

Perhaps this should have been a warning; a back cover blurb stating ""Dual-Layer Format:Layer transition may trigger a slight pause"".
Slight? It sputtered continually on my Samsung player that had performed well before.

I considered sending the whole thing back.
Luckily, I had another DVD player and the discs play perfectly so far on a first generation Toshiba 3109.

So, be prepared that this particular set could annoy you because it may skip worse than a bad record. The back label warning shows that Disney knew that there would be problems on some players, but still put this series out anyway.

But once I did see it (and fall in love with it) I realized I'd been a victim of the poor marketing that resulted in its cancellation. This is a beautiful DVD set; the only shortcoming is a lack of extras (some commentary tracks would have been nice) & there's no scene access -- the only chapter stops are at the beginning of each episode so you have to fast foward to particular scenes. Aside from that it's perfect! Thank goodness the DVD industry has finally realized that people WANT to buy complete seasons or entire runs of their favorite series! They've been releasing them this way in England for years. Until recently all we were lucky to get here in the States were ""best of"" compilations while the bulk of a series' shows had to be caught in synidication (if it were still being aired at all). And, maybe it's just me, but I hate having to watch my favorite shows through the constant barrage of network logos & ""watch this show next"" banners plastered on the screen. And don't get me stated on how a show's tag scene usually gets bumped for an ad for some upcoming TV event I'm not even interested in! Or the networks that squeeze the picture so they can run a constant black bar of trivia & other nuisances along the bottom of the screen.

1777208,4,B00006IRH9,"This series is wonderful.  I don't like most sitcoms and am not very fond of sports so I can't believe I am recommending these DVDs but in all honesty I can't praise the series highly enough.  It is very well written, has great drama and some of the best serious plot lines and yet there hasn't been an episode that has failed provide laughs and at times I've laughed so hard I've had tears running down my face.
As far as the DVDs are concerned, despite the fact that there are absolutely no extras and no scene selections, they are really good.  You can choose the individual episodes or if you're in the mood for a marathon you can put a DVD in and watch the shows back to back.  Even better you have the whole series at your fingertips not just one season!!!!
The only thing I really dislike about these DVDs is the packaging.  They are put together with two DVDs to a plastic case with three plastic cases in the box.  Despite the fact that the only paper inserts they include are a couple of advertisements with the first DVD (all the information about the individual DVDs is on the outside of the cases themselves) they left the area open for inserts and put one of the DVDs on a swinging arm in the middle of the case.  This really isn't a problem but it definitely looks odd almost like they couldn't make up their mind what they were going to do so they chose this awkward way of leaving all their options open.  I currently own 8 TV related box sets in a variety of styles and I guess I have come to expect a certain level of visual care being place in the design of the set as a whole.  I was really disappointed when I saw the way they put these together.  Still as complaints go this one is very minor one.
As a last thought I read an article about the people who put this series out on DVD and it said that they felt it would appeal more to men then women. As a woman, who isn't into sports, I must say that I think that if a woman gives this a try she won't be disappointed and that it would be a great series for couples to watch together.

1777210,5,B00006IRH9,"I've thought often about the reasons why this show meant so much to me and all I can do is talk about snatches of dialog and brief scenes from the show and how they've touched me.
I'm a Manager of many, many people; Isaac Jaffee's philosophy of surrounding himself with smart people who disagree with you is something I've adopted as my personal creed. I show the videotape of this episode in Management Classes I teach to show new supervisors what type of Management style I want to happen in my department.
I love the music of Brian Wilson. I think the word Genius is used too often in the world of entertainment but I do believe Brian is as close as you can get. The pure emotion The Beach Boy's are able to deliver in a song is almost unmatchable by any other artist. The episode that ends with Jeremy trying to deal with his Parent's divorce and Dan is going to go watch
baseball and be with Rebecca the first time, you hear the sounds of Sloop John B, I cry and get goosebumps each time I see the show.
Speaking of crying and goosebumps, I knew that I was addicted to the show when I watched the end of ""The Apology."" The heart filled speech giving by Danny and then when Casey goes to talk to him, instead of comforting him or saying something that would seem hollow or cliched, he starts talking about the ""coolness factor"" of the Starland Vocal Band and you hear the sounds of
""Afternoon Delight."" This moment shows perfectly the relationship between the two men.
I love the spotlight and I love being in charge, but the episode ""Six Gentleman"" reminds me that there are many people working very hard to help my Department succeed and I need to make sure that I not only thank them but make sure they have their moment in the sun.
So these are just a few reasons why I think that almost anyone would enjoy these DVD's.  My only regret is that there are no extras on the discs but when the shows are this good, do we really need extra stuff.
Good show Everyone!",1036540800,4,1969,4.321621621621621
1777211,5,B00006IRH9,"I waited until I had the DVD collection to write this, because there's nothing I can say about this show that hasn't been repeated here 50 or more times. This is, without question, one of the true highlights of network television.

The disc set is simple: 45 episodes spread across six discs, with the division between seasons one and two falling neatly at the end of the third disc. With so much programming packed onto the discs, there's really no room for anything else, so there are no special features.

Thankfully, ""Sports Night"" requires no special features to be special.

Tops on my ""it would have been nice"" list, though, is the removal of the laugh track.  It didn't do anything for the show and, thankfully, it's reduced to almost non-existent by the end of the series. If only Buena Vista had gone back and excised it altogether before putting out the collection.

It's fullscreen, as expected--not many shows were filmed widescreen at the time (""Babylon 5"" being a notable exception), so that's only a complaint because I have a widescreen TV.

I can't say enough good things about this show--this might well be the most positive, uplifting show ever produced...the thinking person's ""Touched by an Angel."" It's populated with good people who are struggling to become better people, with tight friendships of the variety most of us wish we had. As much as Isaac would like to claim otherwise, the line between job and family blurs into obscurity on this show, resulting in closeness, warmth, and inevitable infighting. I care about Dan, Casey, Dana, Isaac, Natalie, Jeremy and all the rest mostly because they care about each other.

The only real complaint I have about this collection is it takes 18 hours to watch the whole thing, which is what I want to do every single time I pick up the box.  I guess I'll have to settle for watching 3-4 episodes a night, taking a couple of weeks to get through what I once waited a couple of years to see.

Thanks to everyone involved in producing this wonderful show and DVD package. This is truly a priceless piece of entertainment--at a retail cost of just over a dollar an episode, it's a bargain of epic proportions.",1036540800,2,2176,4.720316622691293
1777212,5,B00006IRH9,"""Sports Night"", which ran on ABC from 1998-2000, was a brilliant 1/2 hour sitcom in the same vein as ""M*A*S*H"". Created by Aaron Sorkin (writer, ""THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT"" and ""A FEW GOOD MEN""; creator, ""The West Wing""), this Emmy-nominated show was a brilliant, underrated and overlooked gem that took a hilarious and sometimes serious look at the lives and loves of the people behind the scenes of cable's #3 rated sports show (ala' SPORTSCENTER on ESPN--often mentioned as competition). The fiction kid sister of fictional network CSC, the show is run by Managing Editor Isaac Jaffe (Robert Guillaume of ""Soap"" and ""Benson"" fame) and Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman, the former Mrs. Mamet seen in Mamet's earlier films ""HOUSE OF GAMES"" and ""THINGS CHANGE"" as well as his later masterstroke ""THE SPANISH PRISONER"", not to mention the brilliant 3 hour mosaic of misery, P.T. Anderson's ""MAGNOLIA""). The show is anchored (pun intended) by the stars Casey McCall (Peter Krause of ""Six Feet Under"" fame) and Dan Rydell (Josh Charles of ""DEAD POETS SOCIETY""). Then there's the ""help"", Natalie Hurley (Sabrina Lloyd of ""Sliders"") and Jeremy Goodwin (Joshua Malina of ""THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT"" and ""BULWORTH"", currently on Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" in a recurring guest role). This show is an exquisite morsel, a tasty pastry of a 1/2 hour and the final DVD treatment of both seasons of this shortlived masterpiece is a treat for both the longtime fans, the confused who came to it late, and those looking for a good time now.

  The Six disc set is great, including the first season on the first three discs and the second season on next three.  The menus are well set up, playing the familar Sports Night theme.  Let me give big points to person who included the play all function.  So many season sets miss this and it really is a great feature.  I hope in the future more people use it.  (Hint hint, people doing the simpsons collections over at FOX.)  Also each disc is done with the sports night logo and a black etching of a character from the show.
  NOW FOR THE FLAW:  This is a common problem with Disney company based films, the freezing up due to the thin density of the discs.  DVD's work on reflection and if you can see through them, its not a good thing.  When disc three began freezing up on me I pulled it out of my player and looked at it.  My friend who was there then comment that it was a funny mistake how they printed all the logos and pictures backwards on the disc.

In a way I'm really upset about the timing of Sport's Night's cancellation. One more year and they could have inked a much better cyndication deal than Comedy Central gave Imagine.

The other reviews' thoughts on the wonderful acting, snappy directing and terrific camera work are all correct, but this show is all about the dialogue, pacing and pathos which falls from Sorkin's pen.  Fans of The West Wing (I'm one, of course) will find this show to be even more tightly wound than our Wednesday-night wonder.  The half-hour format may be the reason for its edge, or it might be the more-universal subject matter. It's definitely not about sports.

Usually I intend to watch one or two episodes, but I invariably watch more like five or six.

1777226,5,B00006IRH9,"Some people use TV as a soporific, others use it to be engaged, challenged, surprised, inspired, and energized.  Sports Night (SN) was a series for those who appreciate the latter. SN redefined how television shows could engage viewers without pandering to or insulting their intelligence. It offered a humorous, realistic and thoroughly engaging view of intelligent, human and witty career professionals working in a high-pressure environment.
Given that nowadays ""character driven"" on a television show means ""stereotypical,"" these characters live and breathe, and week-to-week, I couldn't wait to find out what they'd do next.
One of the many interesting things about the way SN evolved, was that the ER-style camera work and interwoven, fast-paced dialogue made the traditional network TV model of having a laugh track punctuate every ""funny"" moment woefully inappropriate. As the episodes progressed, ABC wisely allowed the show's creators to drop the laugh track and let the story unfold without such unnecessary commentary.
Another surprisingly well-handled aspect of the show is how it embraced the fact that actor Robert Guillaume had a stroke midway through the series by enabling his character to tackle, onscreen, the questions of competency, careerism, and identity such a crisis might engender.
I don't know if I'll ever forgive ABC for its lack of courage and vision when it came to canceling the show, but with this DVD set SN is finally free of their unappreciative clutches.
If you like your entertainment to do more than offer you a preview of this fall's fashion offerings, Sports Night is for you. Any fan of television that rewards paying attention, like the West Wing, Six Feet Under, or  M*A*S*H* should give Sports Night a try.",1035244800,8,1752,5.253571428571429
1777227,5,B00006IRH9,"Like many fans of this show I wondered why ABC would have cancelled this show after only two seasons.  If you watched this show from the start you would have seen the characters develop and the actors on-screen chemistry surpass that of any other show in ""sit-com"" history.  And just when you get attached to the characters and begin feeling for them...they go off air.
Off the bat, like others, I have to push the fact that interest in sports isn't necessary to appreciate what this show has to offer.  Rarely does the show rely on sports to keep your attention.  With that being said here is some non-biased thoughts:
This is the story of the interactions of a handful of people behind the scenes of a 3rd ranked sports show.  It deals with the stress of real life, family, significant relationships, others, unreturned love, addiction, health problems, etc.
While that may sound like every other show on television, Sports Night does it with a style and flair all its own.  Rather than banking on cheap humor and obvious punch lines this show gets its laughs from fast paced and intelligent rebuttles.  The humor quite a bit like The Royal Tenebaums if you are looking for something to compare it to.

I just put in my pre-order for the DVD set so I can watch it again and again.
The people who compare this show to M.A.S.H. are spot on.  This is a funny, funny show that doesn't aim for the lowest common denominator.
Its sad ABC pulled it after season two.  I guess they thought it didn't fit in with their line up of total crap.",1034294400,3,843,4.128834355828221
1777229,5,B00006IRH9,"I watched the first season when it was on ABC, only because at the time it was on just before NYPD Blue on Tuesday nights.  What started as a time killer became an obsession/addiction.  I just love this show.  This is one of those rare comedies where the writers and actors don't shove the comedy down your throat.  The writing is superb, the actors are great, and you can't help but to fall in love with the characters.  Unfortunately, I missed the entire second season due to various factors, including not knowing when it was on, or if it was on.  I'm so excited that Sports Night will finally be on DVD.
HBO tried to pick up the show from Buena Vista, but BV started playing hardball during negotiations and everything fell apart.  It would've been great to have seen Sports Night on HBO, where the writers could get away with some expletives and sexual subject matters that ABC would not allow.  It would've added even more bang to the show.  Sadly, we will never know.  Hopefully they'll do a reunion movie or something down the road.",1034035200,7,1040,4.5133689839572195
1777230,5,B00006IRH9,"Like others who've written reviews of ""Sports Night,"" I am not a sports fan, and that is why I never tuned in when the show originally aired on broadcast television.  Fortunately, in one of my flipping-through-the-channels moments I caught the tail end of an episode on Comedy Central, and needless to say, I was hooked.
The show has next to nothing to do with sports; instead, it's about the all-too-human interaction going on behind the scenes of a low-rated, ESPN-like network, struggling to make its mark.  It's funny, touching, quick-witted and extremely well written.  This probably had the most to do with its demise in network prime time:  Viewers looking for quality programming most likely weren't expecting to find it in a show with ""Sports"" in the title, and viewers who tuned in because they saw ""Sports"" in the title probably weren't interested in a show this sophisticated.
If you're a fan of fast-paced dialogue, snappy repartee, and storylines that will have you laughing wholeheartedly one moment and reaching for the Kleenex the next, you won't want to miss a single ""Sports Night"" episode.",1033430400,14,1109,5.010869565217392

1777239,5,B00006IRH9,"When Sports Night was first being aired on ABC, I never watched it.  In fact, I never even heard of it.  I sort of remember seeing commercials for it - like the turkey falling on the anchor desk, Dana running into someone and video tapes falling on the floor, but I just never thought about watching it.  At the time I was trying to graduate highschool and was listening to U2.
Even when it went off the air, and Comedy Central picked it up, I --still- never thought about watching it.  It wasn't until last November when I moved into an apartmentm, and I had a night shift that I would watch tv at midnight.  I always watched Comedy Central and while I was online Sports Night came on and I figured what the ... , I'll watch it.  The fist episode I saw was the penultimate show to the end of sports night.  Immediately I got hooked, and I watched the series finale...or what is the series finale since the show is done.
Hoping and thinking the show was still on ABC or whatever channel had new episodes, I went online and found sadly, that it wasn't.  When Comedy Central started the series over I recorded them from the pilot on.  Unfortunately I missed an episode in the first season and after the second episode I wasn't watching it cause I lost my cable.  So I have YET to see the second season, save the first 2 and last 2 of the season.  And now I can't wait until it is released.
I always seem to get into things when they are over or getting over (Sports Night...introduced to U2 in 1997).  It's a sad thing that I had wished I watched the show in it's original run and that it was still on the air.
Yes yes....ratings are important....but screw ratings...the fact is everyone who has ever seen this show has loved it!  There were just people like me who never watched it when it was on because it never crossed their mind!
I will say I am VERY happy it is being released on DVD.  I receieved an email that they are only making 75,000 copies of it.  So if we can get them all sold in the first week MAYBE they'll do a special edition.",1032393600,,2043,4.215938303341902

Never a sports fan until this show, I found myself feeling more alive when exposed to these characters, these people of good conscience doing their best to create something of value. There was none of the formulaic cynicism that mass media generally affords us. In its place was a genuine revelling in the human condition, faith in the basic goodness of we wonderfully flawed mortals, and more wit than television has ever seen.

1777246,5,B00006IRH9,"Sports Night, as most other reviewers here have already said, is a great sitcom written by Aaron Sorkin, who also wrote the movies ""The American President"" and ""A Few Good Men"", as well as the current tv hit ""The West Wing"".  This show is quite a bit more light-hearted than West Wing, and doesn't delve into deep political topics, but it does occasionally touch on a subject that will make you think, and quite possibly inspire you.  It earned several Emmy nominations, and was declared by TV Guide as ""Rookie of the Year"" and ""Best Show You're Not Watching"".

YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SPORTS FAN TO LOVE THIS SHOW!  I have friends who don't care for sports at all, but would absolutely never miss an episode (in fact, it was one of these friends who told me this DVD set was going to be released).  Sorkin masterfully integrates sports as a background, and weaves it into an occasional amusing subplot; but this show is about the relationships and interactions among the characters, not about the sports they cover.

Sports Night is an intelligent comedy that rarely uses ""slapstick"" antics for a laugh, but relies instead on clever, witty, rapid-fire dialogue.  It's 45 episodes of great television.

RATING/CONTENT: I don't know what the TV people gave the show for rating/content, but here's my assessment:
--Violence: none, except when you get laughing so hard your sides hurt.  TV-G
--Language: I can't specifically remember any swearing; if there is, it's certainly mild compared to many tv shows.  TV-PG
--Sex: referenced in dialogue only, no graphic scenes at all; this show is about relationships, not sex, though some sexual references are made.  Probably TV-PG, at worst TV-14",1030492800,13,1687,4.88421052631579

At the end of an episode, you'll be left itching to see the next. Throughout the unnecessarily short two seasons of the series, the characters actually develop and change - so much so that you'll be terribly saddened to bid them farewell after such a short time together.
Thanks to DVD, however, a whole new group of people will be able to experience what has to be one of the best, most overlooked television shows ever, and those that were privileged enough to see it the first time will be able to relive it.

It's short life on the air is a shame, since it was a true original, featuring dynamite performances and smashing writing by ""West Wing"" creator/writer Aaron Sorkin, whose brisk, sharp dialogue style was developed to perfection here. Of course dunces like the first reviewer on this page didn't get it, because it was not a conventional sit-com. Just as ""West Wing"" is a drama with some truly funny moments, ""Sports Night"" was a comedy with an emphasis on character and conflict, rather than the easy set-up/punchline. It also contained beautifully played moments of high drama as moving as anything on any ""ER"" or ""Law & Order"".

From the beginning, ABC had no clue of how to handle this show. First, they insisted that the producers ad a laugh track, because you don't know when to laugh. Then, they started to promote it like a soap opera, because it had serious issues to deal with at times.
Ultimately, the quality of the show came through. A fabulous cast provided excellent performances. Josh Charles (""A Few Good Men"") and Sabrina Lloyd (""Sliders"") are the MVPs here, consistently giving the show it's heart. Peter Krause (""Six Feet Under""), initially stiff in his ""on air"" role as Casey McCall, settled in well mid-first season.
The real gem here is Robert Guilamme (""Benson""), his Issac Jaffe is an excellent character brought to life with his gentle touch. Guilamme's real-life stroke was written into the series, and when he returned in the second season made for some wonderful moments and sly dialogue delivered by the veteran actor.
