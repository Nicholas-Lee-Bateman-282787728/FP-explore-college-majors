6492712,5,B00LN488NS,"How to Train Your Dragon is a great story. Kid safe/friendly but grown up enough for anyone to watch. Loved it in 3D at the theater. Not the jittery overkill special effects, but caught myself brushing ashes off my pant leg. Silly self depreciating humor keeps the story rolling.",1420329600,,279,4.714285714285714

6492726,1,B00LN488NS,"Maybe it was the seller but the item I got matched the image. This is not a US copy. This is a European copy of the dual blu-ray only discs. Maybe you'll be lucky and get a US version of the collection. The movies themselves are amazing, I have them on DVD. Just wanted to have the clearer Blu-ray versions too..",1491782400,3,312,4.131147540983607

I bought this back in October for my son as an Xmas present so of course we just barely got around to TRYING to watch them and there is no regular DVD copy only blue ray so he couldn't watch it on his portable player in the car while traveling over the holidays. Then we we got home the blue ray discs wouldn't even work in my blue ray/DVD player! And I can't return it because it's past the return date!,1483142400,2,416,4.024096385542169

6492740,1,B00LN488NS,"Product doesn't play, both discs are defective. After looking closer at the movies, they seem to be European, so I don't know if that's why they won't play or they're just some crappy copy. Item being returned.",1476230400,2,210,4.702702702702703
6492741,5,B00LN488NS,"Both of these movies are absolutely beautiful to watch in blu ray.  Amazing visual effects, and good movies the whole family will enjoy.  I actually liked the second movie better than the first.  How often does that happen?  I don't say that to take away from the first, I just enjoyed the second more.  It was even more visually stimulating, and I enjoyed the story more.  If you are thinking of getting either of these movies, I recommend getting this set.  You won't be disappointed.",1473033600,2,486,4.647058823529412

6492745,2,B00LN488NS,"The movies are great, but it appears this is a non-american version of the disks - it plays ok, but the digital version redemption code won't work, it says wrong region.  :(  If I'd realized that I would have bought the two separately for $5 more to get codes for both movies.  :(",1469664000,5,280,4.245283018867925

6492751,4,B00LN488NS,"I purchased this movie for my son and it was a great price for the two movies together plus you get digital copies. The movies are great for young children and adults. I received the movies in a timely fashion and everything was great until I tried to redeem my digital copies.  The 1st movie does not come with a digital copy & the second movie the digital copy is only valid in UK, RIO, CHANNEL ISLANDS & ISLE OF MAN ONLY.

The first one was great, and the second one has so much action, and the music by John Powell is so good. I would recommend this Blu-Ray set to anyone tired of the poor DVD quality lately. Also, you would need a Blu-Ray player and an HDTV. Overall, this is a must-own collection, just like the box advertises.",1525996800,,400,4.207792207792208

Other then that there is little that could be said about purchasing dvd's online. They came sealed like how you would find them in a store, they played perfectly fine and will be continued to be played on occasion for as long as my blueray player can last.",1515715200,,474,4.654761904761905
