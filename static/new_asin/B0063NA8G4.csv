8492154,5,B0063NA8G4,The DVD course arrived after having been on order for about 10 days.  The container was packaged well in all respects.  I'm currently working on the first Volume of this DVD training series.  Mr. Gibson does do an excellent job explaining the various facets of electrical engineering and technological information.,1475193600,,314,5.24
8492155,5,B0063NA8G4,The tudor by Gibson is very excellent - I'm very happy.,1453852800,,55,4.090909090909091
8492156,5,B0063NA8G4,"As with all of Mr. Gibson's Tutorials, they are very well done and no matter which one I watch (on whatever subject it happens to be), I can understand the way he puts things, even when someone else teaching the same subjects, can make it seem confusing .. These ECA videos are NO exception to that.

I go out of my way to recommend Mr. Gibson's work to people",1425254400,,360,4.217391304347826
8492157,2,B0063NA8G4,"A bit boring, but he's an expert.",1418774400,,33,3.857142857142857
8492158,5,B0063NA8G4,"This is a great course for people who want to understand the math behind complex circuits. It assumes very little in the way of the student and the instructor is easy to follow as long as you have some basic understanding of algebra and circuit diagrams. Even if you are not sure of your math ability, the instructor gives you step by step instructions on how to solve the equations. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in electronics.",1413763200,,451,4.65
8492159,5,B0063NA8G4,"I have purchased most of Jason's DVDs (aside from the very basic math sets) as I have progressed my way through what I have finally decided will be an electrical engineering degree.  As Jason has started to make tutorial DVDs full time he has branched out from just doing math courses to covering engineering, chemistry and even computer programming.  He now has 5 (and is currently working on a 6th) circuit analysis sets.  The first DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Engineering-Circuit-Analysis-Tutor-Volume-1-10-Hour-Course/dp/B005EN6XQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Engineering Circuit Analysis Tutor: Volume 1 -- 10 Hour Course!</a>&nbsp;introduced Ohm's Law, the Kirchhoff current and voltage laws and series/parallel reduction.  Anyone who knows circuit analysis either from having taken the class or from what you get exposed to in physics, knows that Kirchhoff equations can get very cumbersome very quickly.  After you get past that introductory material you start getting into alternate methods for solving circuits that just have resistors in them (before you start transitioning to circuits that have other kinds of components).  That is where this set picks up.

In this three volume set Jason extensively covers the Node Voltage and Mesh Current methods of solving circuits.  They are modified versions of the Kirchhoff laws that require less equations to solve.  As with most of his DVDs Jason does a bare bones introduction to the concept.  He does not delve deeply into theory or derive equations, he just teaches you what you need to know and then does a lot of example problems which get increasingly more difficult as he goes.  Along the way he takes you through each step in detail so you can follow his thought process.  Unlike Algebra where after you get to a certain point you can do some steps in your head, with circuit analysis you really have to write down everything in painstaking detail because keeping the signs straight is critical.  And there are so many sign conventions in circuits depending on what you are looking at and in what direction you are looking at it, that if you try to do something in your head and do it wrong the entire problem is messed up.  So on every problem Jason walks you through every step to drill the concepts in.

What makes Jason's material different and in some ways better than a lot of the free sources you can get on the internet (although some of those are good too) is that he goes through the material in the same order you will get it in class.  He does not always touch on every concept (which is why you still have to go to class) but he hits the main points that you are most likely to see in a timed quiz or test environment.  His teaching style is learn by example.  Unlike most books and even some teachers, who delve into theory then give one or two easy examples and leave you to your own devices for 50 problems, he shows you how to actually do the work and explains what theory needs to be explained along the way.  Which is great for those of us who are visual and auditory learners.  He also identifies problems that make for really good test problems because they take the ""simple"" ideas and add twists that can trip people up.  The one subject that he does not cover which is usually introduced right after the chapter on Node Voltage and Mesh Current is the Operational Amplifier circuit (or Op-Amp).  It is however really just a twist on Node Voltage, so if you understand that well you have most of what you need to understand the Op-Amp material.

I personally find Jason's style very easy to follow and think he has a knack for making things easier to follow.  He shows you the things you need to know to be able to go to your textbook and work through the problems (which he constantly encourages people to do) and provides a great alternate voice if you do not understand your teacher.  In all, between this volume and volume 1 of the circuit analysis set you get about 1/3 of the material you will see in a first semester of circuit analysis.  While it is not a substitute for going to class, it is great for those who want to prepare ahead of time, or to use as exam prep.",1375488000,,4224,4.7837465564738295

(The Engineering Circuit Analysis Tutor: Volume 1 -- 10 Hour Course!}
It Starts off where vol 1 ended with introducing you to Disk 1
Sect 1: Introduction to the Node Voltage Method of solving circuit equations
This disk covers more material a bit faster than the first vol did.
Disk 2 Sect 7: Node Voltage with Dependent Sources - Part 1
Then you move on to Sect 10: Introduction to the Mesh Current Method
And end with disk 3 and Sect 18:Part 4: Mesh Currents with Dependent Sources -
And that ends the course.
the title indicates it should take one 9 hours to complete all 3 CDs. Again it depends how much time you sit in front of the computer and watch the computer and understand what is being tough.",1341187200,,1181,6.7254901960784315
