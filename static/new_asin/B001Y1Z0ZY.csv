8347945,5,B001Y1Z0ZY,"Three early 60's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (no dubbing or sub-titles) adventure films.  Neutron is a mysterious masked hero (no super-powers and thankfully no wrestling ring matches) who fights the evil Dr. Caronte, or some other bad guys.  Dr. Caronte has a loyal dwarf henchman and a cellar full of UGGLY zombies to do his muscle work.  Caronte is always after some atomic weapon or other super device.  Also in the mix is a beautiful singer and her three ardent suitors, one of which is supposed to be Neutron.  Silly stuff but played straight and entertaining.  A couple of the films has some nice musical numbers in a nightclub.  The black-and-white photography is very good and the quality of the DVD is excellent.  Highly recommended.",1458345600,3,746,5.008130081300813
