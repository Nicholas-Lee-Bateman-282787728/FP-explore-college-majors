7928699,4,B0000507OI,"Any fan of ""Music for the extreme generation"" aka ""Earache Records"" will definately enjoy this DVD/CD.  Plenty of live and production video footage of your favorite ""Grindcore"" bands.  It isn't the ""surround sound"" spectacular you might expect on DVD, but is well worth having if you are a fan of hard to find and watch music such as this.  If you like Napalm Death, Carcass, Morbid Angel, et al, you should not be disappointed with this work.",993427200,,443,4.7272727272727275
7928700,3,B0000507OI,"... But if you still care what I think, read on.  This DVD has a whole lot of potential, and at times it really is decent.  But I've got a number of problems with it: 1) The side labled ""music"" is the DVD side and the side labled ""DVD"" is the music side.  Maybe mine is mis-pressed or maybe Earache thought this would be funny.  2) After playing a video, the DVD is prone to stopping altogether, which means you have to start from the very beginning and go through the introduction.  Maybe my DVD player is trash, or again maybe Earache thought this would be funny.  3) The quality of the Morbid Angel video is really inexcusable; it looks like they made it from a second generation video cassette.  4) The Berzerker - ""Reality"" video is censored.  5) Linea 77 is trash.  Apart from that, I can't complain.  It's good to have Cathedral and Carcass videos.",979516800,,855,4.388535031847134
