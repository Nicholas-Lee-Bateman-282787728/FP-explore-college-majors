2955177,5,B000VWE5OY,"Having seen this program from the first BBc showing, it is the finist the Beeb has yet done.  NOT FOR CHILDREN the language is very street, and some words are being changed for the US TV release.  13 episodes leave you wanting more, and the drama that starts with the return of a group of air passangers from the 1950's is unbelevable.  Having seen teh end of the trird season of the New Dr. Who, now we knnow more about Captain Jack and his background. With lluck this will help others understand this person leading Torchwood better. CSI + X-FILES just don't do it justice. As stated above this show is not for children, The BBC has stated Dr. Who can have Torchwood on it, but due to the adult nature of Torchwood, the Doctor will not be allowed on it.  The Dr is for families, this is not. The Sci-Fi is very hard-core, in more ways than one, and if your looking for a friendly new spin-off of Dr. Who try ""The Adventures of Sarah Jane"", which should be on DVD soon, it just finished in the UK. If you like Battlestar's new look, and can deal witht eh fact the world is not going to be green and happy every episode this show is for you. I'm very much looking forward to season two, and hope you will also.",1190246400,17,1210,4.225108225108225

2955182,1,B000VWE5OY,"Worst writing in recent memory.  Plots are idiotic, characters non-existent, motivations absurd, acting poor to bad (though some is due to the writing).  I made it through 4 episodes, and I challenge anyone to tolerate ep 4.  Wish I had not tested my will power that far.  What a come-down for a Dr Who spin-off.",1507248000,,312,4.618181818181818
2955183,1,B000VWE5OY,Smug always perverse reviews of modernity with a rabid unsettled sexuality carapace. Shagging in the street.  It's pathetic really.,1506729600,,131,5.894736842105263

2955185,2,B000VWE5OY,"I have mixed feelings.  I've watched 11 episodes and feel I probably have to abandon this series, which is sad because the stories are interesting and the cast of characters engaging. To say this is an 'adult' program is an understatement. It's so 'adult' that it leaves me feeling dirty, morally conflicted and a range of other emotions from sadness to anger over some of what is espoused. For example, on a recent episode, 3 people fall through a rift in time from the 1950's.  One of the characters, a middle aged man, falls into despair because he can not get back to his loved ones.  Understandable.  Where it takes a pretty sick turn, is that this character discovers his son, is now an old man, in a nursing home facility with advanced dementia.  The son had no children and therefore there is no one to care for him.  The father, who was still plenty young enough to have cared for his son all the remaining days of his life, ensuring he is loved and protected, instead decides to commit suicide. The main character, Jack Harkness, helps and supports this and that is touted as showing care and compassion.  Somehow this is portrayed as a loving act, to help this man escape that responsibility and duty of care to his son?  Where was the concern for the son and what in practicality amounts to abandonment by the father? This episode was an affront to all parents of the mentally disabled and the mentally disabled themselves. I am a parent of a mentally disabled adult.  It would be a DREAM (in a weird way), not a nightmare, were we able, at the end of our children's lives,  to shave 50 years off our age and be young enough and strong enough to care for our children to their last day.  Our greatest fear is that we will pass and leave our children, here alone, with no-one to love them and protect them. What an act of weakness and cowardice that this show presented as an act of mercy from Jack Harkness?  A TRUE, admirable act on Jack's part would have been if he looked that man in the eye and said ""Yes, this all sucks, but grow a pair, step up to the bar and go take care of your son!!!""  This is but one of the moral standards this show promotes that is egregious.  The language is not just profanity but sexually shocking at times.  A couple of sexual scenes almost rise to the equivalent to soft porn; uncalled for.  So the bottomline for me is that although this series COULD have been outstanding, the constant moral offenses make it one that I can not recommend.  Note to the writers.  Simple premise...you have the gift of story telling, creativity, etc.  Use your power for good, not evil.",1504742400,3,2616,4.446540880503145
2955186,2,B000VWE5OY,"This series just didn't do it for me.  Maybe some of the hype lifted the bar too high.  Certainly not in the tradition of great science fiction, British or otherwise.  Some characters have potential, but the writing seems to overshadow them with their overrated counterparts.  Captain Jack Harkness: One small splash on the screen of today, a meaningless drip in the deep sea of theatrical history.  Seriously, leave the stage. your four screaming fans don't represent the four hundred that want to see the next act.",1503532800,,516,4.953488372093023

But after five episodes, the lackluster acting and pathetic scripts... along with characters who were about as likable and empathetic as zombies... I couldn't do it any more.

2955189,5,B000VWE5OY,"I'm a super huge fan of Doctor Who so course I had to start watching Torchwood I became a ducted Captain Jack Harkness is an amazing character and I'm on my fourth time watching this series I kind of wish there were more seasons, however I do understand cat and jack isn't supposed to be aging but you can definitely tell he's not as young as he was in the first season of this so I got it I adored all seasons they were a number one top grade",1500854400,,443,3.9887640449438204

2955192,5,B000VWE5OY,"Like many I didn't see this when it first came out, and now I understand the intense devotion by the fans. This is a very adult series especially for those who have only seen the heroic side of Captain Jack Harkness on Doctor Who. John Barrowman isn't afraid to show off some of the darker edges of his character (there are times when you either don't agree with his decisions or don't like him very much, even if he gets things done). It was great training for his most recent role as Malcolm Merlyn on Arrow.

Note: this is for mature children on up due to adult content, and episode 6 (Countryside) can be downright horrifying even to adults.",1499817600,,645,4.420168067226891

2955194,4,B000VWE5OY,"Gwen personifies the typical 21th century woman with a sexual drive and liberal view  that allows everything or anything. She is fornicating with men and women from left to right, cheating on her partner all the time and maybe she loves other creatures as well!.She wants to have  sex with everyone she encounters, I mean this girls is a sex addict and magnet!.",1498176000,,361,4.714285714285714
2955195,1,B000VWE5OY,"Emotionally and morallyy stunted characters, lackluster performances and extremely stupid storylines combined to make this a real loser.",1497052800,,136,6.611111111111111
2955196,1,B000VWE5OY,"I really wanted to like this show. It was like a British Warehouse 13 with aliens. But after the adultery in the 6th episode I had to stop. The characters don't seem to actually develop; Tosh is a generic computer tech character that is bland and boring; Owen is unlikable by design who is such a fuck-up it's inexplicable how he keeps his job; Ianto is given backstory yet remains very stubborn and 1 dimensional, and becomes a useless sobbing mess in any kind of slightly stressful situations; and Gwen is supposed to be the ""human"" one of the group, yet she cares about herself first, and others only if they're in immanent danger. None of these characters seem to learn from their past experiences, and all of these people regularly wave guns around willy nilly. Jack is the only decent character with depth but even his character feels shallow at times.

Finally, I'm no prude, I don't mind sex scenes or same sex relationships in media, but Torchwood builds up a female protagonist as a heroine and role model for women, has her commit adultery, rationalizes it with excuses, and has her boyfriend forgive her after she confesses, then makes him forget the whole thing via an amnesia pill. Not acceptable. That one event soured the entire series for me.",1496793600,,1259,4.6968325791855206

2955206,5,B000VWE5OY,"This spinoff from ""Doctor Who"" is much darker, more violent and sexier than the prior series. ""Doctor Who"" shows mostly the lighter side of contact with aliens (although some storylines are pretty dark/intense), while ""Torchwood"" shows pretty much only the dark side.

It's also full of  -- as one of the special features is titled -- sex, violence, bllod and gore.  Be warned, the sex is of all varieties -- straight, gay, sex with aliens and more.

It was established in ""Doctor Who"" that Captain Jack Harkness ""swings both ways"" but it's shown here in much greater detail.  I like it!",1486857600,,587,4.772277227722772

I am currently watching season 1 on Prime because it's so much easier than digging out the DVDs and trying to remember which episode I'm on - Prime just automatically knows where I left off.  Captain Jack is very charming - a character that was first introduced on Dr. Who.  If you're a fan of Dr. Who, you should like Torchwood, too.  Love the Welsh accents of Gwen and Ianto, too.

2955452,3,B000VWE5OY,"Imaginative, often witty and iconoclastic and occasionally imbued with a good dose of cruelty and amorality, Torchwood offers a flavor that American TV is incapable or unwilling to emulate. The serious negatives for me: with the exception of the newest member of the Torchwood crew and its immortal captain, there is practically no character development or growth. Consequently, the series as a whole seems a bit two-dimensional: one could watch the episodes with no concern about the order of viewing them. Worst of all, despite the introduction of new props and gimmicks in each episode, their underlying structure is always the same. After having watched 6 very similar episodes, I'm ready to quit.",1470528000,,701,5.212389380530974

2955458,5,B000VWE5OY,"I just discovered this show via Amazon Prime.  It's that combination of cheesy/cool sci fi that's carried by its characters and keeps you watching even though some of the storylines are terribly contrived.  It's fun and has an unusual setting (Cardiff, Wales) that adds to the show's visual appeal.  It's a spinoff of Doctor Who, which I never watched, so I can't make a comparison on that score, but it does stand on its own.  It's sort of an ""X-Files"" with alien tech and a mysterious backstory.

The characters are flat, and the storylines range from ""well, I kind of liked that episode"" to just plain terrible. Definitely nothing that made me sit up and think ""wow, this is a GREAT show"" unlike some of the stories on Doctor Who. Captain Jack doesn't even feel like the same character as he did on Who.

There ARE also quite a few sexual encounters, and it seems like the intent is to make everyone feel bisexual (except maybe Owen) with no real plot reason. They also seem to like to show Rhys naked for some reason.  I've heard that it gets better and season 1 feels like a whole other show so I'm going to give the rest of it a try (plus, there's only 4 seasons and it's fairly short). Here's hoping the addition of James Marsters (even if only for a few episodes) helps make season 2 better.",1468454400,,926,4.255681818181818

2955583,5,B000VWE5OY,"As a fan of both Dr. Who and The X-Files, I cannot get enough of Torchwood. The show follows one of the most memorable characters from Season 1 of Dr. Who in his own blend of the Dr. Who imagination and a more grounded, adult look into the Earth that inhabits the Dr. Who universe. The exploration and adventures that Captain Jack Harkness and the rest of his small crew at Torchwood make for a really unique and engaging experience. The added adult nature of the show makes it a bit more mature and relatable for older viewers and fans of Dr. Who. One of my favorite things about Torchwood is the constant references to the events that took place in the main Dr. Who series. These little details reward you for paying attention to both shows and drawing connections between them. Now, that is not to say that you need to see Dr. Who in order to enjoy Torchwood, because Torchwood is great entirely on its own, but it definitely has tie-ins with the major series. I have to admit, I might recommend Torchwood over Dr. Who to people who want to see some quality British sci-fi and aren't quite ready to suspend their disbelief and watch Dr. Who. Perhaps if you found the main Dr. Who series to be over the top, check out Torchwood for a more grounded and relatable glimpse into the Dr. Who universe and you might find that you've become a fan of all things Who just like I have.",1465776000,5,1377,4.3828125

Torchwood is the hip & sexy team of geniuses formed to identify & study anything/anyone who travels through the portal.

Rose and Dr. Who are attempting to defeat ""The Empty Child"", something that would not have been achieved without the help of Captain Jack. From 2005 to 2010, Captain Jack traveled with Dr. Who through 11 adventures and 2 doctors (Charles Eccleston, Dr. Who #9, and David Tennant, Dr. Who #10).

Meanwhile, in late October, 2006, Torchwood emerged as a series. The first season took its viewers into the mysterious world of the Cardiff of the Time Rift! The viewers are introduced to myriad never-before-seen creatures and to the concept of a wonderful potion that wipes the memory of anyone who imbibes it! Weird, wild, and wonderful!

2955715,5,B000VWE5OY,"A spin off worthy of being in the Dr. Who franchise universe. The fist season starts out a little slow and I think they should have tied in more of the episodes with each other as they started to do more at the end. I like a show where there is a story arc that goes throughout the season. That concept is teased a lithe here but seems like it was written and filmed assuming the worst - that it would be a one season and done show. I am biased as I am a fan but in short I would recommend giving it a try even if you know nothing about Dr. Who or the backstory, it might even be better that way. Great entry point into someone wanting to get into Who but not sure where to start. Current and future Dr. Who show runners take turns at Torchwood episodes so it gives one an idea on how a Dr. Who episode would go.",1463616000,,812,3.897590361445783

(Though for a man who comes from the ""future"" seems to have no clue where or how something is going to happen, but must investigate, seems more of a from another dimension, than future)Talk about secret service. With Gwen unwittingly stumbling upon a device testing, that could help her solve the mystery of a dead man. Amongst the mystery, there's the alien devices, pills that make you forget the past 24 hours, and a magic lift (wish I had one, not to mention the pills and one of the devices...).
If you enjoy movies like Men in Black; tv series similar to X-files, but with a comedic skew, you'll love Torchwood.

2955801,3,B000VWE5OY,"I initially liked the series, but found my interest flagging as the series progressed. Jack's character has a brusque leadership style and seems to alienate his team. I found myself wondering why they bothered to follow him. Then, and this going into the second season, Jack's character development seems to be unfocussed. He had a touching love for a woman in his past, and he seemed most human at that time. The later divulging of the original Jack whose name he took, seemed a peculiar an unexpected twist, and the entrance of a past partner in the second season was annoying. Tosh's character seems rather weak and doesn't seem to hold her own in this team. You would think this team would need to be a tighter working group. The young man who seems relegated to clean-up and the geek of the group is such a sidelined undeveloped character that I cannot remember his name. I felt that the writers started off with a great idea, but didn't know where to go with Jack and his immortality, so threw unexpected plot twists in that pulled the series down.",1463184000,3,1054,4.611702127659575

2955822,2,B000VWE5OY,"If you skip episodes 1,2,6,7, 12, and the first episode of Season 2, you might find a show that almost deserves to be in the shadow of Dr. Who.  The aforementioned episodes are just skank and gore.  The mind-reading episode misrepresents the Welsh when their thoughts are exposed as being so shallow and disgusting.  Which leads me to believe the writers must hate people, and their product confirmed it.  ""So there's no decent script, budget or expectation of acting ability?  Just throw in two men kissing, nobody will know the difference.""  Owen reminds you of a very non-discriminating daycare with too many kids without shots, which would make Jack the equivalent of a male prison shower floor.  Lots of skipping ahead this season.  But something behind the scenes happened at the second season, they got new writers in or something.  The Dr. Who brand alone was enough to carry Torchwood one season, but obviously they had to get wise.",1463011200,,941,4.867924528301887

2955878,1,B000VWE5OY,"The writers of this show consider Torchwood the grown-up version of Doctor Who. So, let me get this straight. Grown up means swearing a lot, acting stupid and immature, and sleeping around indiscriminately. Is that what we are brainwashing people to believe? Doctor Who is far superior than this show for adults. Having watched John Barrowman on Doctor Who, I had such high expectations for this show. In Torchwood, he is serious, pathetic, and an emotional wreck. It's difficult to feel sorry for him or anyone on the show. Except for the episodes that were written by women, there was too much graphic violence, especially Countrycide and Cyberwoman. Also too much graphic sex and too many same-sex scenes. I'm no homophobe but give me a break. Is everyone on this show is either bisexual, gay, or confused? Hard to tell and I don't care anymore. They act like they are in a college fraternity but are suppose to be running this important organization. Not believable. It's not just the same-sex scenes. All the sex scenes are drawn out to an embarrassing level. If I wanted porn, I'd watch porn. This show is also very dark and depressing. No wonder society is messed up. Shows like this give you nightmares and you with a bad feeling and sad. There's enough sadness in the world. The show also seems to be anti-Christian. In Out of Time, Jack tells a guy who wants to commit suicide that there is nothing after death. Everything goes black. Then he helps him commit suicide. Nice. An episode that had promise but turned depressing. No happy endings here. No thank you. I'll stick with Doctor Who.",1461715200,,1600,4.738351254480286

2955940,2,B000VWE5OY,"While the potential of this series is high, it utterly fails to satisfy.  Plots end without satisfying conclusion.  Few characters are likable.  Too much time wasted on childish melodramatic subplots.  There is no consistency, such as, gratuitous flings in one episode then unconvincing serious love from the same character in the next episode.  The science fiction elements sometimes show promise, but most are silly, and therefore, the serious plots when they do arise feel awkward and out of place.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell what the series finds more important, good stories or gay relationships.",1460678400,,609,5.291666666666667

2955944,1,B000VWE5OY,"This is a tedious and boring little series, typical of the British who refuse to waste money on things like quality writers, good actors, and realistic side effects.  This is like a bad spin off of Dr. Who with the same disjointed attempt to make ordinary things appear fantastic and bizarre.  The props are something you would expect in a high school play and for that matter so is the acting.  To top it off, this series blasts you with some loud dissonant music at the opening and closing of each series.

God Awful is being too kind to this series.  It even lacks the obligatory hot blond that such bad productions usually rely upon.  Instead we get a short plump gal with a huge gap in her front teeth.  She is slightly cute but she lacks acting skills and sex appeal, which means there is not much there to keep the watchers interest.

Oh yes, it does have an inordinate amount of woman on woman kissing, but even that is obviously contrived for effect.",1451606400,,959,4.44

In one world we see like live Doctor Who, but in another world, brave and immortal Captain Jack Harkness is fighting against aliens. Torchwood is not sentimentality. This is drama series where every character is individual. The staff of Torchwood aces of their profession. I have the feeling that they can do everything and they're not afraid of anything. But they, like every person, has its weaknesses. And often this is contrary to the Charter of Torchwood.

Actually, there are episodes when the cast has male relation ships with other males and females kissing as well. If this bothers you then I would suggest to be prepared. Its not until the last few episodes that it takes a turn. I started the second season had to switch to Netflix because Amazon started to charge for it and it is free there and its the same kind of thing. It has a good story about a team that hunt aliens so it is science fiction I did enjoy that part and especially the free first season. But, if you decide you like it.

The HD quality seems to go up and down depending on connection or how you size the window. I've seen Torchwood look excellent to very bad. The Silverlight plugin works most of the time but its not as fast as Netflix. Sometimes the window is playing sound but video goes blank and I must pause and play. The shows don't move onto the next video in your watch list or the next episode. Amazon cut this program out in the middle of the month and it pissed me off. Torchwood was the only thing I've watched this year. I can't watch the show with a membership anymore, so 1-star.

Too much a kiddie show. Been a long long time since I was a kid. So I tried this spinoff with reservations. It's okay. I like that it's set in Cardiff. The acting is competent in that British tv way. (The actor playing Jack Harkness is a better fake American than you often see on UK tv, though he still slips up.) But the stories are kind of silly and almost-kiddie-Who, despite the attempts to sex it all up, and the effects are low budget in a distracting way. I take it Who cultists react differently, but I can't get past a lukewarm response.",1418601600,,717,4.128571428571429

2955993,3,B000VWE5OY,Started watching this series because of Captain Jack in Dr Who. The show is just ok and Captain Jack isn't the same on this show (stern) as he is on Dr Who (outgoing and loveable).,1418515200,,180,4.171428571428572
2955994,5,B000VWE5OY,"I had never seen so much as an episode of Torchwood when it was originally airing - oh how I wish I would have.
Thanks to John Barrowman being on Arrow I started to search out videos online of his convention appearances, came across many that were Torchwood cast / him talking about the show, so I decided to watch a couple of his Who episodes, LOVED them, had to see Torchwood... By the middle of season 1 (streaming on Prime) I ordered the entire series on Blu-ray (first ever blu-rays ordered)

The show is very well written, it is smart, it is cheaky, it has a wonderful cast and great characters. It is somewhat built on the Dr. Who mythology, but it stands on its own feet. You don't have to know the Who world/episodes to be able to enjoy this show on its own - but they are well worth watching (Christopher Eccleston and David Tenant seasons at least).
I find myself watching the episodes over and over, on the computer or on Blu-ray, over and over. They don't get old, the jokes stay funny, always enjoyable.",1418169600,,1017,4.380952380952381

The characters lack the cohesiveness that the characters in Dr. Who have, but their setting is not the same as in the Tardis. Torchwood headquarters is definitely not bigger on the inside.

Episodes

1~ ""Everything Changes""
The story is told from the perspective of Gwen Cooper, who comes across the Torchwood team through her job as a police officer with the South Wales Police, who are investigating a series of strange deaths. Through Gwen's discovery of Torchwood, the audience are introduced to team members Owen Harper, Toshiko Sato and Ianto Jones. Suzie Costello, as played by Indira Varma, had also been billed as a series regular prior to transmission, though in a twist the character was revealed as the murderer and killed off at the end of the episode, with Gwen replacing her as a member of the Torchwood team.

2~ ""Day One""
The episode centres on Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) working her first case with Torchwood Three in Cardiff. A purple alien gas is loose in the city and takes Carys Fletcher (Sara Lloyd Gregory) host; the gas kills its victims by orgasm, leaving behind a pile of dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her. In the end they track her down to a fertility clinic; the gas leaves Carys to take Gwen host, but is stopped by a portable prison cell and dies out.

3~ ""Ghost Machine""
When Gwen retrieves an alien object from a fleeing man in a hoodie, she's haunted by a vision of a lonely young boy. As the team tracks down the object's owner, Owen experiences an even more terrifying vision and a long-buried crime resurfaces.

4~""Cyberwoman""
In this episode, Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) is revealed to secretly house his girlfriend, Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), a half-converted Cyberman, in the basement of the Torchwood Hub. Ianto wants to turn her into a human again, but by doing so her Cyberman influence takes control, and the rest of the team must stop her before she could become a threat to Earth. However, Ianto still believes she can be saved.

5~""Small Worlds""
Jack encounters monsters from his past: fairies, with the ability to choke people and change the weather, make a series of killings centred around a little girl, the Chosen One. He also reunites with an old friend, but will Estelle Cole be safe when she starts to get a little too close to these fairies? And how can Torchwood stop a force from the dawn of time, masters of Earth, their domain? More importantly, what is so crucial about a little girl named Jasmine, for whom these creatures will gladly tear the world apart?

6~""Countrycide""
Concerned that the space-time rift is spreading, Torchwood investigates a series of gruesome deaths located in a small village in the Brecon Beacons. What sort of creature could cause such shocking injuries? Stranded without communications or equipment and isolated from one another, the team confronts a terrifying enemy.

7~""Greeks Bearing Gifts""
Tosh is given an alien pendant which lets her hear other people's thoughts. As the Torchwood team puzzle over a centuries-old skeleton, the pendant forces Tosh to question her commitment to Torchwood. Is her new-found ability a blessing or a curse?

8~""They Keep Killing Suzie""
Torchwood is linked to a series of brutal murders around the city. As Jack and the team investigate, it becomes clear somebody wants their attention. What is Pilgrim -- and how is it connected to a figure from Torchwood's past? The resurrection days are far from over. They have no choice but to bring back Suzie.

9~""Random Shoes"" A hit-and-run victim, obsessed with alien life, realises only one person can solve the mystery of his death: Gwen Cooper.

10~""Out of Time""
When a plane from the 1950s lands in modern Cardiff, courtesy of the Rift, the passengers are reoriented by the Torchwood team, who becomes drawn closely to their lives.

11~""Combat""
Still wallowing from the end of his relationship with Diane Holmes, Owen fell into depression. Likewise, Gwen Cooper had grown sick of her affair with him after this change in personality and the buildup of guilt toward cheating on Rhys Williams. It was in this episode that she called off the affair and tried to right things with her husband in a ""dress rehearsal"" speech, where she confessed to Rhys all her goings-on with Owen, only to supply him with Retcon so he would remain in the dark. Instead of being forgiven, he reacted maliciously, causing her great pain.

12~""Captain Jack Harkness""
While investigating an abandoned dance hall, Jack Harkness and Tosh find themselves having slipped through time and stuck in 1941, where the dance hall is being used for service personnel. Jack meets the real Captain Jack Harkness, the man whose identity Jack took after his death, which Jack learns will be the following day at a training exercise. Jack and Tosh recognize that they must find a way to open the Cardiff Rift from the present day in order to get back, and Tosh begins to work out ways of leaving the necessary equations to the rest of the Torchwood team. Jack manages to talk to Captain Harkness, and learns that the officer is attracted to him, though such demonstration in that setting and during those years, is socially unacceptable. The two talk more, Jack asking if the Captain would like to go elsewhere, but he refuses, acknowledging that Jack has obliquely told him that his remaining time on Earth is limited.

In the present, the rest of the team come to realize Jack and Tosh are missing in time from photographs taken during the dance, and also determine that the Rift is the only way to bring them back, though Ianto believes it to be too dangerous. As they investigate the dance hall, they meet its proprietor, Bilis Manger. Unknown to them, Bilis is also present at the dance hall at 1941 and has attempted to alter and change the messages that Tosh is leaving for the Torchwood team. After finding the Rift key that Jack placed in a clock in Bilis' office and Tosh's equations, Owen is prepared to take the chance to open the Rift. Ianto holds him at gunpoint to try to stop it, but Owen refuses, and proceeds to open the Rift. As the dance in 1941 winds down, Captain Harkness invites Jack to dance with him, shocking the other partygoers. During the dance, the Rift opens. Jack says his goodbyes to the Captain, giving him a passionate kiss before he and Tosh step through the Rift. Bilis is also pulled through the rift. In the present, they are met by Gwen and return to Torchwood, where Jack and Tosh share a toast to the late Captain Jack Harkness.

13~""End of Days""
During Gwen's (Eve Myles) morning off with her boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), they both see news reports of UFO sightings over the Taj Mahal, and an armed clash between CO19 officers and English civil war era soldiers. When she returns to the Hub, the team learns that they are caused by unstable rift activity after it was opened to rescue Tosh and Jack.[1] Torchwood has its hands full; Tosh and Owen (Burn Gorman) investigate cases of the Black Death in a local hospital, where Tosh sees a glimpse of her mother, while Jack and Gwen are alerted by PC Andy to a Roman soldier in a police custody. In that time, Gwen sees a glimpse of Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin). Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) sees Lisa (Caroline Chikezie), who tries to convince him to open the rift. During a heated argument, Jack fires Owen. While at a bar, Owen sees Diane (Louise Delamere), who tries to convince him to open the rift.

Jack and Gwen go to Bilis' clock shop, ""A Stitch In Time"", where they learn that Bilis can step between eras in time. When Jack leaves, he shows Gwen a vision where Rhys dies. Gwen rushes to Rhys and has him imprisoned in Torchwood for protection. However, Bilis causes a power cut to raise a security breach in the Hub, releases Rhys, and kills him. Gwen and Jack find Rhys' body in a pool of blood, just like in the vision, and Gwen screams in horror. Jack tells her that they cannot bring him back, but she knows the only hope of restoring him is to open the rift. All but Jack agree to this, and attempts to stop them by holding the team at gunpoint. When he insults them, they attack and kill him, scan his and the team's retinas and open the rift. After Jack revives himself, they discover that Bilis has manipulated the team to open the rift, in order to release Abaddon, a creature similar to the Beast,[2] whose shadow kills anyone who touches it. This gives Jack an idea; he cannot die, so it can feed off his life. The shadow attacks Jack, but a blue light flows out of his chest and destroys Abaddon, killing Jack, seemingly for good.

The rift is now closed. Gwen is relieved to see Rhys alive. After several days, Jack is still dead, but is brought back to life after Gwen kisses him goodbye. The team welcome him back, (Tosh gives Jack a hug, Jack hugs and kisses Ianto, Jack forgives Owen and hugs him). Later Jack announces to Gwen that the rift is now more volatile than ever. Gwen questions him: what would tempt him to open the rift to which Jack replies ""the right kind of doctor."" As the rest of the team go for a coffee run, Jack sees the Doctor's severed hand glowing. He then hears a familiar whooshing noise coming from above the Hub, and runs towards it. The rest of the team are perplexed at Jack's sudden departure, believing something has taken him.",1409356800,,9667,4.675294117647059

2956114,4,B000VWE5OY,"Season One is a good introduction to the characters in Torchwood while building a backdrop of who they are and what they do. All actors bring their best in an enthusiastic performance. Rapport with the characters is built quickly. The indiividual episodes of Season One goes here and there, sometimes with almost cartoonish aliens popping in and other episodes on other chores. The entire cast is enjoyable and work well together.

One word of caution, this is NOT a series for children. There is violence, language, and a surprising amount of sexual conduct. And that irrestible twinkle in Captain Jack's eye swings both ways - he is bisexual, though his sex scenes are gay. I was surprised by this and none too pleased as were a number of others according to critics. Apparently, writers felt that a series based in Cardiff, Wales, to be interesting, needed a swinging group. They were wrong. John Barrowmen gives a charismatic performance that allows one to overlook these unnessary personal details; his character is powerful and his goal is for all things good for the world.

2956122,4,B000VWE5OY,"I debated 3 vs. 4 stars because I think I would really give it a 3.5 if I could.  The basic premise of the show is not ever really written into the storyline.  The idea that something big is going t hit in the 21st century and they are preparing for it, really?  How?  When?  None of the characters know what they are preparing for but jack, just dealing with stuff that comes up.  By the end of the season they have at least professed to be collecting alien and alien technology in preparation, but we don't really see a lot of aliens or alien tech.  It is focused on a rift in the time-space continuum in the writing, and in the shows plots.  There is no real character development in the traditional sense of writing, other then Gwen.  Some with Jack, but more in regards to that he is a mystery.

So get past that you just jump into a story full speed ahead, and that the assertion of the shows introduction doesn't really align with the writing, and you still somehow get a show that is entertaining to watch.  Given this is entertainment that isn't so bad.  The mystery to Jack in coming season makes you ask why, when revealed who cares?  People die, weird stuff goes on from catastrophic to x-files weird but show just clunks along and basically entertains episode to episode making it worth watching.  So don't worry about the overall mismatch of overall story and actual stories and it is entertaining enough and good enough to watch and enjoy and not get caught up in the many anomalies because in the end It does what I want any show to do.  Entertain me.

Can understand the lack of awards coming for any aspect, but entertaining enough that it got by for a while and kept getting funded.  So just don't look to deep and enjoy what you can.

I also love the different types of aliens and the main aliens, ""The Wevvils"" are very human-like which is great. It gives an in-site on the creativness of the human mind, that until I watched ""Doctor Who"" and ""TorchWood"", I didn't know an adult could have -Not that I would recommend you let your child watch this or any child for that matter, given their not as mature minded as me- Its great to know that adults may just be as imaginative as me.

Jack Harknas is a sexy hilarious blisexual man that's around 150 years old, and can never die (SORRY FOR THE SPOILER). He's shown as the leader of TorchWood, but also an amazing friend. He goes through many hardships and has more secrets then comprehended in season 1. He makes for one of my favorite characters.

Ianto Jones is a irresistible (in my opinion), bisexual, sarcastic, mature, and serious young man. He's known  the Tea-Boy or butler, but soon proves to be capable of much more. He is most defiantly my favorite character out of all.

Owen Harper is a charming, seemingly bi-curious (As shown in the first episode), snarky, cocky, confident, smart young man. He's the TorchWood doctor. He's also a very good fighter.

Tosh(Toshika) Sato is a young, beautiful, bisexual, technological genius. She's TorchWoods computer freak. She's also secretly in love with Owen. She's also good on missions.

Gwen Cooper is a pretty, brave, caring young women. Personally, I think she's a bitchy, to curious, slut. She's just a girl who goes on missions. She's dating Rhys Williams. She's unmistakably my least favorite character (Which sucks because it's mostly in her POV)

Here are some of my absolute favorites of season 1:

#1, ""Everything changes"":

Episode summary (In my words):
Gwen Cooper is a regular WPC who sees TorchWoods craziness on a particularly crazy murder investigation. Being a genuinely curious person, she goes on her own investigation of mysterious sexy babe Jack Harknas and the rest of the TorchWood crew. She gets into more then she bargains for when she actually meets Jack Harknas and learns the inside workings of  TorchWood headquarters.

My review:
We meet the amazing characters of this ""Doctor Who"" spinoff. Unlike alot of other shows there is no awkwardness between the characters in the first show, which is amaZing.

My favorite quotes from ""Everything Changes"":

""Love this planet. Still at least I won't get pregnant, never doing that again."" - Jack Harknas

""I walked. I bloody walked."" - WPC Andy.

""Well that lasted No .2 seconds."" Suzie.

""And he looks good in a suit."" - Jack Harknas (Because it's true)

""Careful. That's harassment, sir."" - Ianto Jones.

#2, Cyberwomen:
Episode summary (In my words):
In the basement of the TorchWood headquarters, Ianto Jones hides a horrible secret: His girlfriend, Lisa who worked for TorchWood 1.and was converted into a half-Cyberwomen.

My review:

This one really hit me in the emotional territory, because Yan (Many people's nickname for Ianto) couldn't bear to live with out Lisa. I love how in this episode he proved himself to not just be a coffee boy, but is also hste the fact that Jack aimed his gun at Ianto. AND it has Gowens (Gwen and Owen ship name) and Jantos (Ianto and Jacks ship name) first kiss.

My favorite quotes from ""Cyberwomen"":

""Gwen, this is for you, baby."" - Owen Harper

""OOH! Come to daddy!"" - Owen Harper

""Girls, get your own bags."" - Owen Harper

""Some times in order to save what we love, we have to risk losing it."" The doctor trying to fix Lisa.

""Sure, take ten seconds."" - Jack Harknas

""The human race is weak."" - Lisa

""Ianto, I need to here those beautiful Welsh vowels."" - Jack Harknas

#3, ""They keep killing Suzie"":

Episode summary (In my words):
Suzie gets resurrected, when people are murdered to get ""TorchWood""s attention. She doesn't die right away and almost kills Gwen.

My review:
Bloody awesome. Although, I wish Gwen AND Suzie would've died. No offense to Eve Myles, she's an amazing actor.

My favorite quotes:
""My team bitch about you all the time."" The police captain

""Are you always this dressed up for a murder investigation?"" -  The police captain

""Why? Would you rather me naked?"" - Jack Harknas

""If it's someone we pissed off that narrows it down to, oh, four or five million?"" - Owen Harper

""And that's just the humans."" - Jack Harknas

""Then, you better stay away from sharp objects."" - Jack Harknas

""The Riz-Miz."" - Ianto Jones

""Give Ianto a stopwatch and he's happy."" - Owen Harper

""It's the button on the top."" - Ianto Jones

""Meaning of life, does God exist, all that stuff."" - Tosh Sato

""Rules and regulations."" - Jack Harknas

""Well stash him away too."" - Jack Harknas

""That's all we are in the end. A stash of boxes."" - Tosh Sato

""All right, so we kill her again."" - Gwen Cooper

""Life knife."" - Ianto Jones

""Yeah, You frighten the s*** out of me."" - Owen Harper

""I had a boy friend who use to walk into a place like that. A grand entrance. Got kind of boring. Though he was one of twins, so I put up with it. Twin acrobats. Man, I gotta write that book. Maybe, even illustrate it. You know, I can talk for a long time. A very long time."" - Jack Harknas

""I must be mad."" - Gwen Cooper

""Nice work, Ianto."" - Jack Harknas

""Nothing. Just nothing."" - Suzie

""This is. Driving through the dark. All these stupid, tiny things. We're just animals howling in the night 'cause it's better than  silence."" - Suzie

""Lots of things you can do with a stopwatch."" - Ianto Jones

""That's the thing about gloves, sir. They come in pairs."" - Ianto Jones

That's my review. Hope it was useful! :) <3

2956161,4,B000VWE5OY,"As a fan of Dr. Who, you will often find this as a one off from Dr. Who. After much catching up on Dr. Who, I decided to give this a try.

As many others have written a reviews complete with spoilers, I will simply share a few thoughts here.

I completely enjoyed this series. There are many differences between this show and Dr. Who. There are a few similarities. Those who enjoy Dr. Who but would like a little bit more darkness in their shows will most likely enjoy this.

Why did I rate this a low five? Mainly because it is a bit more risque than I prefer. It addresses adult issues such as same sex couples, bisexual preferences etc. And really, it doesn't address them so much as it is a way of life for many of these characters. For me, the good thing was that it didn't turn this show into a political statement - it just simply was a part of this show.

Torchwood is more like one of those shows that would be shown after nine here in the U.S. when I was a kid. It has enough scenes that indicate sex is occurring or has recently occurred to be risque.  Some examples might be- Gwen walks in on the main Jack Harkness and another man and you can clearly see buttocks and male on male kissing.  There is some drug use. And even some alien cruelty, which completely bothered me- much like hearing about someone being mean to the neighbor dog. There is also swearing. While these things might not bother some/many people, it is worth noting prior to watching this series, that there will be some who find it offensive.

I loved the aliens and I loved the mysteries that they solved and the problems they solved. It is a fairly fast paced show with quite a variety of shows in each season. To be honest, I would have continued watching this show if there had been more seasons/shows to watch.

Enjoy.",1398816000,,1806,4.291176470588235
2956162,3,B000VWE5OY,"This show is a mix of Doctor Who camp and typical crime drama gore and sex.  Some explicit sex scenes might attract some viewers but they do not fit with the rest of the show.  At least three same sex / gay interactions occur that are just confusing. Is the character really gay, or is he just being nice to the guy who is going to die tomorrow ?????

The characters are so flawed, selfish and childish, I think that the serial killer Suzie would have been forgiven and would have kept working on if she had not shot herself.",1398816000,,525,4.23
2956163,5,B000VWE5OY,A great series with riveting stories to satisfy your science fiction needs. Each episode has as much drama as any full-length motion picture.,1398729600,,141,5.173913043478261

When I saw the pilot, I thought to myself, not promising, then they added Eve Myles, AKA Gwen Cooper to the team, and I concluded, that was the end. The Gwen character is the most annoying character I have seen in a story of it's type. She is silly and unconvincing. The Owen character is almost as bad. The rest of the cast does a good job. They finally wrote off Owen. I think it is way past time to write off Gwen. Torchwood needs a rethink, and a rewrite to make it the good SiFi show it should be. If you are going to do a spinoff, of what I consider to be one of the best SiFi shows of all time '' Dr Who ''  you have got to do better than that.",1395360000,,767,3.9483870967741934

Torchwood may be a spin off, but it is surely capable of standing alone. There are a few mentions of ""The Doctor,"" but aside from those non-spoiler mentions, this series is really standing alone. I'd say there is nothing like it on tv, at least not in America, nor that I've found on the BBC. This series has a lot of cursing, sex, blood, and some good violence. The acting is superb, and I'd make a special note to the actor portraying Owen, I'm looking forward to finding more things with him in it. He steals the show in quite a few scenes I dare say.

I don't want that or need that added to the program to make it attractive or interesting.  As a matter of fact, due to the sexual content I find watching Torchwood unpleasant.

Season 1 starts out a little slow with character development.  Jack, Ianto, Tosh, Owen and Suzie are all grouped together in Torchwood Cardiff Wales.  Exit Suzie and enter Gwen.  That's when the fun begins.

2956243,4,B000VWE5OY,"I am torn between three and four stars for this because It isn't really a very compelling ensemble drama (not entirely realistic and the script often seems artificial and forced), while as a Dr Who spinoff it has way to much adult content to be kid (or work) friendly and while most episodes make sense in terms of the typical Dr Who sensibility - but with NSFW adult content a couple of episodes are just too grim.  The cast is constantly complaining of burnout, which would make sense in terms of the depressing episodes, but often they do so in the context of personal victories which again feels forced.

That said, the show gives you plenty of opportunity to each of the characters other than Jack go through some fairly transgressive experiences that provide some interesting acting challenges.  Too bad several of the characters are so hard to like.  As for jack, he's the main link to the Dr Who / Saturday Cartoon sensibility in that he gets to act the hero with no personal consequences.  They occasionally try to portray him as haunted, but it just doesn't work.  In the end this is a guilty pleasure in which you get to see several Welsh characters having a lot of gratuitous, but semi realistic sexual experiences in the context of an otherwise completely unrealistic fantasy situation featuring famous Welsh landmarks.

And why the heck would such a small crew with some much going on be working on their own with no support staff or interaction with offsite colleagues at other locations and still be working with the knowledge and deference of traditional law enforcement.  Dr Who is more believable than that, when you think about it.",1394064000,,1651,4.748251748251748

2956290,4,B000VWE5OY,This was a different type of Sci- Fi show to watch for me. I compared it to other  sci fi shows and It ranked above average in my taste. However it is not something I would pay per episode to watch..,1392422400,,199,3.8536585365853657
2956291,4,B000VWE5OY,"I like the character development, and the story lines are interesting. There is lots of action without being overly bloody. If you can accept time and space riffs, the stories are credible.",1392422400,,189,4.9375
2956292,3,B000VWE5OY,I was enjoying the first year but by the fifth or six episode it became to sexually oriented for my taste. I though the story line behind the show started ok but not after the sixth episode.,1392336000,,190,4.162162162162162
2956293,5,B000VWE5OY,"When I first started watching Torchwood, I thought it would be the British version of X-Files, but it's turned out to be so much more. They've covered so many odd and quirky paranormal topics that I now can't wait to load the next episode to see what's next on their agenda! The Temporal Rift is one bizarre goodies chest! What's going to come out of it in seasons 2 thru 5 (psst... I already know about season 2 but I'm not telling! *smirk*) The larger principal cast on which to focus has turned out to be a real bonus. I've loved each and every character development episode. Oh, and how I do so love the Brits' more relaxed attitude about portraying sex on TV... OMG, the episodes with Jack and his wartime namesake and Owen with his lady out of time were the HOTTEST things I've seen outside of a theatre and even hotter than most of those in this (U.S.) country! [Note to England... next time you repress a group of people into leaving and forming their our country, could you please make it a group of sexual libertarians??? This bunch of Puritans you unleashed on us is no fun at all! *LOL*] But anyway... Torchwood has turned out to be a most delightful surprise. I'm enjoying every minute of it. I just wish your 12 & 13 episode seasons were more like the 22 episode seasons of Farscape. I'm really going to hate it when I've seen them all, knowing that there will be no more coming. *sob* But I think I'll get over it. ;-)",1392336000,,1433,4.350746268656716
2956294,2,B000VWE5OY,"I love sci-fi, but after 3-4 episodes I'm throwing in the towel. I like the Jack Harness character, but I can't stand Gwen Cooper. I think that character is totally miscast, there is nothing compelling about her. None of the other characters are interesting either.",1392249600,,265,4.911111111111111
2956295,4,B000VWE5OY,"Interesting premise and entertaining to watch. The writers want us to believe that an agency like this could exist with some sort of public funding, only a few key members and seemingly no outside interference from the funding arm of the operation... It's easier to believe all of the alien stuff than the totally autonomous existence of the team.",1392249600,,347,4.898305084745763
2956296,2,B000VWE5OY,"Eh...cheesy.  Ok, but nothing great.  Good mindless background show while working, but nothing I would go out of my way to follow.  The characters over-acted, and were way too one-dimensional.  The cinematography was decent, but un-original in any way, and the supposed sexual tension between the two main characters was way too forced, making it just awkward.",1392249600,,360,5.2631578947368425
2956297,4,B000VWE5OY,"Watched the first episode of the last season one night and my wife and I stayed up till 2 am watching the whole season. Just tried it on a whim and ended up really liking it. Nothing against the leading guy being gay but I have to turn away as I'm just not into seeing the sex scenes of that. But hey, to each his own. Still like the show and all the characters. Hope it comes back. We started watching it from the beginning just to understand the whole thing better and it helps. The last season stands on it's own though.
We love it would like to see a few more seasons. Think there is a lot more places it could go.",1392163200,,618,3.9919354838709675

2956301,4,B000VWE5OY,I am enjoying this series because it is a different kind of story line. Chasing aliens is not new but this puts a different twist on things. Also the characters are well suited for their roles.,1392076800,,193,4.388888888888889
2956302,4,B000VWE5OY,"It's not exactly Doctor Who, but still a great series for ""sci-fi"" fans.  And it's got some humor in it.  Some of the sexual content makes it inappropriate for family watching.",1392076800,,176,4.645161290322581
2956303,4,B000VWE5OY,"I really enjoy this - but I love Sci-Fi.  It's really entertaining - suspenseful, funny, sexy - lots of fun!  It can be a little corny at times but that's part of the fun of it.  I never heard of this series before Amazon Prime - a hidden treasure.",1391990400,,248,4.020408163265306
2956304,4,B000VWE5OY,"This series is a Dr. Who sort of spin-off. It isn't related to that series in character or theme, but it reminds me of it. I could have done with a little less explicit gay sex, a little less nudity period would have been nice as we have children in the house. Still, sex is not the over riding theme here, and there's a legitimate story to be told. Unfortuantely, I watched the 4th season first, and the sex increases in that season substantially. I'm not a prude, I just don't want my 9 year old to walk in the room asking a question while 2 men (or 2 women) are fornicating.",1391990400,,577,4.160714285714286
2956305,2,B000VWE5OY,"Cheesy dialog, contrived romantic moments, and underdeveloped characters/plot lines = boring for adults.

Kids of a certain age don't mind that stuff and would enjoy the wacky science fiction plot lines. But the episodes have scenes that are either too racy or too scary for young children. Wouldn't want my kids watching it.

This show doesn't choose an audience and produce for that audience. It's confused.

Americans stereotype Brits as having bad teeth. I think the Brits are fighting back with the lead American actor whose upper teeth are so perfect they look actually really weird, like dentures or something.",1391990400,,617,5.15

2956311,3,B000VWE5OY,"Overall, I like this series, but as a spinoff from Doctor Who, I find it lacking in many respects.
The series is supposedly about countering alien technology and incursions, but only a few episodes actually introduce any alien elements.  The plots are predictable, almost completely lacking in suspense.  Doctor Who is full of likeable, engaging characters, but most of the characters in this are bland, with nothing to get the viewer vested in their experiences.
The production values, especially the cinematography and lighting, are much better than average.  The set decoration leaves a lot to be desired, with seldom more than some dark tunnels and stairs to look at.  The sound quality is full and dynamic, but the use of music to set the mood doesn't quite get the job done.
The actors do a fine job with what little they're given to work with.  The writing is seriously lacking in character development, which may be why the characters are so hard to get engaged in.
I will probably watch the entire series, in the hopes that it improves, but if it continues at the status quo, I won't be watching it twice.",1391731200,,1114,4.751295336787565
2956312,2,B000VWE5OY,"I was a bit disappointed with Torchwood, I expected it to be fun like Dr. Who.  But it is too dark and subjects that weren't worth watching.  Only tried to watch a few but had to skip through lots of them.",1391731200,,205,3.975609756097561
2956313,4,B000VWE5OY,"Science fiction helps my mind focus away from life's harsh realities. I like that Torchwood tends to be more grounded than Doctor Who without being so serious as to be stressful. In particular, I am impressed with the character portrayed by Eve Myles. Captain Jack comes across as a less than serious hero who is quite interesting, but less than convincing. Despite my criticisms, anyone who enjoys science fiction should like this show.",1391644800,,437,5.0
2956314,5,B000VWE5OY,I love all of the Torchwood gang! I have watched 16 episodes in 6 days... addict :-) Cannot believe how awesome this show is. Looking forward to watching Sarah Jane Adventures as well.,1391644800,,184,4.606060606060606
2956315,3,B000VWE5OY,I decided to watch this because of Dr. Who!!  Well...  Nothing like The doctor .  It fell short for me in the first two episodes. Maybe it gets better but I just can't hit play on the 3rd episode.  Slow and clunky.  Just not really interesting .,1391558400,,245,4.127659574468085

2956318,4,B000VWE5OY,"It has started very well and it grabs your attention, but the writers suddenly starts to go a bit away from the initial proposal. So, from alien lives and equipment, it went to Rift based central thing.
The character Owen is the best char in this story, but it is centralized more over Gwen (extremely dull character)",1391385600,,317,4.578947368421052
2956319,5,B000VWE5OY,"I have only gotten about half way through the first season but I am anxious to watch the remainder. I am a very devoted fan of Dr Who and I watched the Torchwood mini series Children of Earth and also Miracle Day, I loved them! Very engaging, and as most of these shows do leaving you wanting more.
I'm always anxious to watch more. Can't wait for the new Dr Who, Is there more Torchwood after Miracle Day? It sort of left it open for the possibility.",1391299200,,451,4.195402298850575

Set in Cardiff, Wales (NOT London) for a change.  2d in command is a policewoman with no training in paranormality, whom everybody tries to bed, often successfully despite being engaged.  Small band of emotionally troubled denizens of 2007 form rest of team that always solves (sic) the major crisis at the last minute through skill and luck--of course-- whilst often laying the ground for the next improbability. despite burnout, deceit, sleeping with each other in sequential pairs M/F.

2956324,4,B000VWE5OY,This is a very lite SciFi show.  They are really not concerned with the science of things and are not for the Heinlein or Asimov follower.  The characters are believable and episodes deal with their day to day lives as well as aliens.  They do leave a lot of questions unanswered even to the end of the series.  For Americans the accent will get in the way of understanding what is being said. However this is an easy show and enjoyable to just relax and watch.  I would recommend it to any that do not demand total accuracy in their Science Fiction.  If you are a Dr Who fan this is the show for you.,1391299200,,601,4.182608695652174

2956360,5,B000VWE5OY,"TORCHWOOD (or DOCTOR WHO in another spelling) was and is a great series. More adult than DOCTOR WHO and filmed in Wales the show was filled with everything needed to make a good watch. Captain Jack, (gorgeous!) along with the rest of the team are a great ensemble who fill the hour with everything from aliens to ghosts to time travel and always a little bit of humor thrown in. I loved this show when it first aired on BBC America and was thrilled to find it available on Amazon Prime. Although I seriously doubt I missed any episodes I will enjoy watching each and everyone again and hopefully catching one or two I missed. A great show that I recommend to everyone! Watch it and be entertained.

The story line is very good, good action and good character development. I have only begun to watch the first season, but I know I will keep watching.",1390176000,,281,4.127272727272727
2956362,3,B000VWE5OY,"I like Dr. Who and the interactions with Torchwood were always good episodes but the organization seemed more competent and organized than it does in this series.

Torchwood seems more like Scooby-Doo episodes with a team of amateurs figuring out the villian of the day and killing, imprisoning or having sex with it.

A lot of adult content, not graphic, except for language but you might have to explain a lot of gay innuendo and sexual situations.",1390176000,,450,4.8311688311688314

It can also get seriously gross and have graphic violence; which is strange because the science and realism of the show is often just dumb.  Never the less I am drawn to the shows intense overacting and dramatic intensity (so far).",1390089600,,406,4.5479452054794525

I originally decided to check out the series via Amazon Prime (where I got all episodes FREE!) because of my knowledge of Torchwood--although I found, much to my surprise, that prior knowledge was totally unnecessary to enjoy the series!

2956386,5,B000VWE5OY,"Great show with a tie-in to Dr. Who.  The more you watch the more the characters grow on you...even Owen.

The Torchwood Institue is a ""secret"" organization (with a flashy Land Rover with sirens and lights and the authority to take over any crime scene they feel falls under their jurisdiction).  Cardiff is the convergence for a lot of weird activity and apparently has been for some time as some of the stories take you back hundreds of years.

As with any show, there will be some episodes that leave you asking ""Why?"", but overall I have been impressed with the storytelling.  Campy, strange and creepy, will all be covered in various episodes.

I was highly entertained by the entire series and hope you are as well.  Enjoy!",1389657600,,729,4.6484375

Apparently there is a rift in the space/time continuum and their job is to contain the threat.  Quirky characters and frank and very un-American treatment of bisexuality make this a unique and refreshing change from the usual TV fare offered in the states.",1389657600,,350,4.915254237288136

2956389,5,B000VWE5OY,"First the characters were interesting.  They all had flaws and like a family they made mistakes that had to be forgiven.  The plots were plausible, if sometimes fantastic.  They also exposed the way in which our insane government thinks, that is, keep the people in the dark, they cannot handle the truth and ""alway protect your own personal interest, even at the expense of the public. I think they had a nice balance between exposing government for its faults and weaving a good story.  Capt. Jack was an interesting character.  Clearly a mans man on the one hand and clearly homosexual on the other. Socially making the statement they are not mutually exclusive.",1389657600,,665,4.849557522123894

THEY FOCUSED ON THE PEOPLE AND HAD A LOT LESS VIOLENCE AND GORE.  I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL INVEST ANY MORE TIME IN THIS SERIES, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE LAST SHOW OF SEASON ONE!  IT WAS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.  ALSO I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSORY TO MAKE CAPTAIN JACK GAY!!  I KNOW IT IS COMPULSORY NOW TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE GAY CHARACTER IN EVERY SHOW ON TV BUT, REALLY?  IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE INTERESTING IF THERE WERE SOME SORT OF ROMANCE BETWEEN GWEN AND THE CAPTAIN.

2956403,4,B000VWE5OY,"Overall, I'm hooked! It took me a few episodes to get over my Americanized/Hollywoodized television expectations. The protagonist, Gwen, has a large gap between her front teeth, and it appears there's no attempt to cover her facial freckles. At first, that was extremely distracting; now, I find it charming. (And wish Americans were as comfortable with ""imperfect"" characters.) The basic concept is okay: aliens, time travel/warp, anything paranormal being investigated by a special team. Captain Jack is an American with a mysterious past. He's intriguing. NONE of the characters are stock! Each one of them is flawed. There's no reservation with adding a little ""bad guy"" to the good guys. Sometimes it's funny; sometimes it's a bit cheesy. My American sensibilities are often tested with the open sexuality...but I get over it! I look forward to whenever I can squeeze in another episode.",1389139200,,892,5.244755244755245
2956404,4,B000VWE5OY,"I just discovered this show (in 2014) while doing a couple of art projects that require media distraction and was pleased to discover that, while some of the story lines seem a little repetitive, the BBC was presenting same-sex relationships as equal in dramatic weight and meaning to straight relationships... even in 2006.

By following one character's introduction and eventually membership in Toarchwood, the viewer learns about the Institute so often referred to in Dr. Who. The writing and some of the content are meant for adults. This is not sci fi for kids. There are references to Dr. Who as well.

It's actually entertaining, and even Americans can understand them!  The female lead in this series has a mouth full of... crumpets, or something.

Plus, there is no accent I love so much as a Welsh one.  Bonus.

And did I mention sexy?  Well, not much else to say except this is a really smart and sexy show.  And can I really mention often enough; sexy?

2956447,5,B000VWE5OY,"Edgier that Dr. Who, from which it was spun off, Torchwood uses the science fiction format to explore multiple aspects of human relationships. Although each episode could be viewed individually, it's better to watch the entire series to follow the evolving stories of the characters.  The actors deftly make their encounters with aliens, alien technology and sometimes bizarre human behavior seem entirely believable.  They are also easy to identify with in their conflicts with, and compassion for, each other.  John Barrowman is great as the decisive and enigmatic Captain Jack Harkness who can also can also betray moments of frailty and self-doubt.",1388275200,,652,5.372549019607843
2956448,2,B000VWE5OY,"This one is just an unbelievable plot, if you can call what they have a plot.  This kind of trash just shows that anyone can make a film for BBC airways.

2956457,4,B000VWE5OY,"Even though this has a markedly different feel (perhaps not so much as some of the more recent Doctor Who storylines), it stands well on its own.  The plots are rather on the bizarre side, as befits its lineage.  And the characters are fun to watch.

2956460,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a story I would recommend.  It truly makes one think about what it would be like to live through the centuries.  It is a spin-off of a Dr. Who sort of show however Torchwood was more for older people, not so young; meaning those who stayed up after 9pm.

The members of the Torchwood Institute, a secret organization founded by the British Crown, fight to protect the Earth from extraterrestrial and supernatural threats.  It tells a story of not the ""original"" start of Capt Jack Harkness, but maybe it began on Dr. Who interchanges.  I have throughly enjoyed this series as it tells a story to which you cannot wait till the next episode.",1387670400,,653,4.594827586206897

2956463,2,B000VWE5OY,"I'm an avid Doctor Who fan, but I'll be honest and say I didn't do my research before starting into Torchwood.

I liked the premise and enjoyed the pilot - a bit more ""R-rated"" language and a dash of violence I was willing to accommodate for a solid storyline in a universe with which I'm already acquainted and friendly.

But ""Day One"" quickly killed my hopes with the leap into pretty gratuitous sex almost right off the bat.  I even read the brief description and chose to be (naively) optimistic, thinking that the sexuality would at least be semi-obscured in that ""something's happening, but it's mostly off-screen"" kind of way.

Nope.  It's all right there, on the sink in the ladies' room.

I'd expect that from an HBO or Cinemax sort of show, but after watching several seasons of Doctor Who, I suppose I just wasn't expecting that from BBC.  Now I know better.

That isn't to say there isn't a lot of quality stuff going on.  But I set out for something lighthearted and entertaining and not explicitly sexual.  I found that in the pilot, but in the next episode it turns out I signed up for softcore porn instead.

After reading a few more reviews that lead me to believe that this is this series's M.O., I'm disappointed to say I'm opting to go find another series to watch.",1387411200,,1285,4.51948051948052

Overall, it is an excellent production and will be enjoyed by those who favor police-type who-dunnits as well as the sci-fi crowd. However, I found the utterly unnecessary promotion of homosexuality disgusting and inappropriate for viewing by younger audiences. I am not a homophobe but on the other hand, I think it tasteless of the writers to force the audience to endure scenes of male to male fondling and French-kissing which contributed little or nothing to the plot or theme of the story. I would wager that there is a homosexual writer on the staff of the Torchwood series who enjoyed taking the opportunity of shoving his lifestyle down the throats of the audience (no pun intended).  Not recommended for adolescent audiences. Just my 2 cents.",1386201600,,816,5.08955223880597

2956476,1,B000VWE5OY,"Despite the fact that I absolutely adore the Dr Who franchise I tried to temper my expectations.  It is a spinoff after all and those rarely live up to their source.  However, instead of a watered down Dr Who as I was expecting I ended up with one of the most god awful television shows in recent memory.  I don't mind the swearing or the violence.  It's quite honestly never really offended me.  I enjoy a number of very graphic shows like Spartacus and Game of Thrones, but in this abomination we're introduced to one of the main protagonists as he uses an alien aphrodisiac in order to rape a woman at the bar. Granted, because of certain events he doesn't follow through with it, but it was definitely not a moral turnaround.  The rest of the crew isn't much better.  Little jealousy fits and love spats between all of them.  It's almost as if they decided to take an idea introduced in the Dr Who franchise and hand it over to a day time soap opera writer and this is the result.  I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to cheer for characters like this.  there should be some attachment to characters in shows you watch.  If a primary character perishes it should hit you, make you feel something.  There isn't a single character on this show that I would shed a tear over.",1385596800,9,1276,4.382978723404255

2956480,5,B000VWE5OY,"After watching seven seasons of Doctor Who within 3 months, I decided to check out the Torchwood series. For the most part, Torchwood is an awesome ride that I really enjoyed. Watched it all within a month, it's probably better this way. Season 1 will probably be more enjoyable when I go through and watch it again. It took me a while to really appreciate Gwen, I didn't dislike her but it seemed like the amount of time spent on Gwen's life outweighed the other team members. As sometime who already watched Doctor Who I'm curious if viewers were supposed to catch on to exactly who's hand was in that jar Jack had back when this first aired. My only real complaint is we never find out HOW exactly Jack ended up with the hand. Moving on, Torchwood season 1 was a lot of fun to watch, there are some darker episodes, the finale was absolutely great, the box set is beautiful. I'd recommend catching a rerun on BBC America or watching it for free somehow, somewhere before committing to buying the sets.",1384473600,,1004,4.491803278688525

2956483,3,B000VWE5OY,"Season 1... I liked it and it was okay.  I'm liking season 2 much, much more because the cast seems more cohesive and the story lines aren't just about who's sleeping with who and Jack shooting people/aliens.

My daughter watched every Dr Who episode and is a big fan, nothing inappropriate just a little creepy. It would have been nice if they had a heads up 'sexuality content' disclaimer.

2956511,4,B000VWE5OY,I like that the series is streaming for Prime members.  Like the convenience of being able to watch it almost anywhere.,1380844800,,119,4.666666666666667
2956512,5,B000VWE5OY,"Good science fiction show with a witty script.  This is what many shows have tried to do but Torchwood, Buffy and Firefly set the mark that other show can only hope to match.",1380844800,,174,4.2727272727272725
2956513,1,B000VWE5OY,We started watching this with some excitement that we might have found a clean show. They dropped the f-bomb in the first five minutes with no need or reason. That killed it for us.,1380499200,5,181,4.352941176470588

2956516,5,B000VWE5OY,"Even though the ""monsters"" are a bit cheezy, the storylines are believable and the characters sympathetic. By the end of the second series it gets a bit old.",1380412800,,157,4.642857142857143
2956517,2,B000VWE5OY,"I thought this might be an interesting series to watch but it seems to be headed for every campy SciFi theme that I ever saw from the 1960's. Gas that is alive (was't that on the original Star Trek series?), a cyborg that looks like it was designed by a kid going through adolescence, and on and on. I kept hoping it was going to improve but it hasn't yet after 5 episodes so I guess this is what the whole series is like. That is too bad. Better writing could have made this one interesting.",1380412800,,492,4.135416666666667
2956518,5,B000VWE5OY,"This British series is a super star. It really deserves more than five stars! It is a cheekier version of the X-files. Scully and Mulder move over you have met your match! Picture a super squad of specialists keeping the world safe from all manner of aliens and cosmic anomalies. Torchwood comes in to save the day when an event or crime seems something beyond the usual. They are lead by the daring Captain Jack Harkness who has some secrets of his own. This is an adult series with adult themes but it is a pure pleasure.
You will laugh, you will cry and it will make you think. What more can you ask for! Bravo!",1380412800,,614,4.301724137931035

2956524,4,B000VWE5OY,It's an interesting show. I have never seen a single episode of Doctor Who but this show was a good introduction to the universe and I highly recommend it for anyone who liked the X-Files.,1379980800,,188,4.4
2956525,4,B000VWE5OY,I have enjoyed this production.  Lots of fun and the writing is exceptional.  I enjoyed the character development and it is refreshing to see a successful professional life and a successful personal life even it borders on the fantastical.,1379980800,,239,5.102564102564102
2956526,1,B000VWE5OY,"I saw it suggested that if people don't want their science fiction to be full of this bizarre, pointless sex, we must be repressed, but I love gay men, I love Barrowman, and this show is just dumb.  The stories make no sense and I wonder if Torchwood makes situations worse instead of better.  Gwen certainly does, and apparently she gets away with it because she's so good-looking -- seriously?  Seriously??!!!  Even if I thought she was really hot I wouldn't let her work in a place where she keeps screwing up and destroying lives because of her immaturity, immorality and idiocy.",1379808000,3,583,4.686274509803922

2956530,5,B000VWE5OY,This is a great show. I would recommend it to anyone who like SYFY. The plot & characters do a great job to keep the show interesting enough to stay with it to the very end & stiill want more.,1379203200,,192,3.825
2956531,5,B000VWE5OY,The first time I watched a Torchwood show I was hooked.  I love the characters and the wacky stories for the series. You don't have to be a Dr. Who fan to like this.,1379203200,,165,3.8529411764705883
2956532,5,B000VWE5OY,Enjoy the actors and characters.  Spin off of Dr. Who series.  Love the episodes because they are raw and smash mouth.,1379116800,,118,4.571428571428571

2956537,2,B000VWE5OY,"The writing was poorly crafted and many of the plots straight rip-offs. The biggest problem I had was with the continually fluctuating sexuality of EVERY character in the show. I am not a homophobe and I have no problem (not much anyway) seeing gay lifestyles depicted on television if it done in a normal and natural fashion. The scenes in this show were about as natural and welcome as a prison rape. Nearly every character in a majority of the episode flip-flopped their sexuality with the casualness and frequency of changing their socks. It was so over-used that it became the central theme to the show and the plot of fighting aliens secondary. I kept hoping the writers would get it back on track but 5 minutes into episode 1 of season 2 it was clear they were going to continue and I will not return to the show, which is a shame because I was really excited when I finished Doctor Who and saw it listed amongst Amazon Prime's offerings.",1378944000,,945,4.5321637426900585

2956541,4,B000VWE5OY,"Being fans of Doctor Who we have been wanting to watch Torchwood for some time. Most of the stories are pretty good but there is way too much sex between, well, everybody. Sometimes it seemed as though the show was more about the sex than fighting aliens and obtaining their technology.",1378512000,,286,4.627450980392157
2956542,5,B000VWE5OY,"This is my second time in watching the series, this time via Amazon Instant View.  The characters all have their strengths and weaknesses and although the series is about taking on aliens that come to earth, the most appealing thing are the characters.  Eve Myles, playing a British police officer, joins Torchwood, headed by the immortal Captain Jack, played by John Boorman, who first appeared in the Doctor Who series.  She has to forget her history as a police officer, although that training does have its use at times, and learn to deal with a world unknown by most people.  The interaction between characters, some times amusing and sometimes tragic, and the magical world that Torchwood touches makes this an incredible adventure worth experiencing again and again.",1378512000,,773,5.062992125984252

2956546,5,B000VWE5OY,"I was expecting a sci-fi or paranormal program and this came out of left field. The idea of a secret agency chasing aliens is not original but Captain Jack Harkness and his wonderfully flawed cohorts make it a watchable program. Captain Jack is a cross between Kenny in South Park, Mulder in the X-Files and, well, you have to watch it.",1378339200,,336,4.524590163934426
2956547,5,B000VWE5OY,An interesting combination of characters. Captain Jack Harkness keeps everyone wondering- gay or straight or bi. Any way about it the man is a super talent. I hope this will continue to be produced though I hear it is on hiatus at present.,1378252800,,239,4.5813953488372094
2956548,4,B000VWE5OY,It is a very good series.  It sure isn't an American series; since it has some different sexual situations you would not find on US Tv.  A good spin off from Doctor No.,1378252800,,168,4.0606060606060606
2956549,4,B000VWE5OY,"While providing an intersting travel through the time-locked Cardiff of the Doctor Who universe, the sets were distractingly poorly made and the acting was occasionally over the top. Otherwise a very well written and executed series",1378166400,,232,5.472222222222222
2956550,4,B000VWE5OY,Sci-fi from the BBC for all to see here in the USA. Since cutting the cable cord we have had to find other sources for TV viewing and Amazon Prime seems to be great so far. Torchwwod is one of my favorites.,1378080000,,206,3.9285714285714284

2956552,5,B000VWE5OY,I enjoy it.  Nice fantasy and it is predictable enough so that I can just listen to the audio and glance at the video once in a while without missing anything.,1377734400,,159,4.129032258064516
2956553,5,B000VWE5OY,"Very capturing and funny and lovable characters.  Scary enough to Kee my attention and love the far out imagination of the writers.

2956555,5,B000VWE5OY,"This is a graphic, sexy, syfy drama that hits you right in the gut. Dr. Who alumni Captain Jack Harkness leads a team of special ops that keeps the world safe from ghosts, aliens, monsters, and any other weird stuff. Captain Jack is more of an anti hero to Dr. Who's feel good story. Jack is willing to handle the dirty work that frankly would turn Dr. Who's stomach, but that's why Who knows he is necessary.

2956561,4,B000VWE5OY,"I can't understand why they couldn't have toned the content down just a tad, so that at least
older teenagers could watch the show (as it was with Doctor Who), but the story lines are
excellent, the dialogue is good, and the actors are quite good.",1376956800,,247,4.391304347826087
2956562,3,B000VWE5OY,"I would have given it 1-2 stars but embarrassingly, I'm a sucker for the current day sci-fi.  There are just so few shows even close to replacing X-files/alien investigation type plots that I would not want to turn anyone away that's looking for this type of show.  Surprisingly, it has more plot than say Primeval (currently showing 2013).  It is just that some of the lines in this show are hilariously tacky, that unless you a die-hard for this kind of alien thing, you'll probably settle for some other kind of sci-fi.",1376870400,,522,4.6521739130434785

2956565,3,B000VWE5OY,It seemed to go okay.  The story arc needed some more help though.  It was told decently but something wasn't resonating very much as I watched the first episode.  I think they needed a plot first and then introduced the characters and the settings.  Seemed to be a little bit more reversed than it should have been?,1376438400,,316,4.491228070175438

2956567,5,B000VWE5OY,"This spin-off is a darker, more grown-up show than its parent show, 'Doctor Who'.  But it is fantastic!  The charming Capt. Jack Harkness is a much more complete character, full of mystery, anger, sexuality, and resolve.  His team at Torchwood is a socio-psychological study in PTSD.  But it works.  All the angst, terror, pain, sex, and play create a team that the watcher is at turns delighted with, frustrated with, and always fascinated by.

And John Barrowman as its star is absolutely, fantastically, wonderful.  Were he not the embodiment of Capt. Jack, he would be nothing short of the Doctor himself.",1376352000,,609,4.97029702970297

The American lead actor of the team is pretty good, but the British police women is kind of goofy and sleeps with quite a few guys in various stories. The stories keep you watching the show and not the sex scenes",1376179200,,386,4.22972972972973

Its Dr Who (10th DR style...), but with more death, more violence, and highly sexually charged at times...both hetro, homo, and bi-sexual...Torchwood holds no preference or grudges.

2956591,2,B000VWE5OY,"After me and my husband watched all the episodes of Primeval on Netflix we thought we would give Torchwood a try.  We assumed it would be similar to Primeval with a sci-fi edge.  You know what happens when you assume!  First of all, I cannot even watch the show without subtitles.  Being an American I had a hard time picking out some of the characters dialogue, especially the Welsh actors. I could catch some words but definately not all of them so we had to watch with subtitles so I wouldn't miss important dialogue.  Secondly, as we have only watched 6 to 7 episodes so far I find the show to be one of those that you either love or hate.  It is not very engaging like I hoped it would be, it is somewhat dullish at times and some of the acting is either too much or too little?  The story lines are interesting enough but the execution of them isn't phenomenal.  I think the one with the evil fairies is the only one I have liked.  I don't care for the barrage of language or the unnecessary sexual comments but that's just me!  I think at this point my husband and I will abandon the show if some viewer can assure us it will get better as episodes progress.  Comments very welcome!",1374278400,,1189,4.263392857142857

2956596,4,B000VWE5OY,"I'd say, the first two episodes were good, or interesting, then there was a drop for 2-3 shows where they struggled with identity (Did they want to be Dr. Who(ish) or not?) Then, everything settled down and the show took a wonderful turn for the better and established a reasonably unique identity they can be proud of that is more Alfred Hitchcock meets The Twilight Zone in nature than the comic strip sci-fi of Dr. Who.

By the 9th show of the season Torchwood took off on a sprint.  They tossed off any likeness to US produced shows like ""Fringe"" or ""The X-Files"" and embraced the odd, sci-fi human drama that I remember from the black and white TV days of the Twilight Zone where Burgess Merideth played the last man on earth, finally having all the time in the world to read any book he wanted...before he broke his glasses and could not read with out them. I'd say that they were more like Alfred Hitchcock Presents except with a returning cast, setting and characters.

I would not say that these shows are ""like"" the twilight zone"" only that, in the same way that the ""Twilight Zone"" could air an episode one week that is more Action Adventure and Science Fantasy (as John Wyndham of Triffods Fame might call it), the next week the show would be a dark, quirky human story about how ""one should be careful about what one wishes for.""  This isn't slip shod and peace meal either, as one might think from what I've said so far.  Like most modern suspence/thriller/sci-fi shows, there is a multi-layered plot at work keeping the entire plot organized and effecitve and various sub-plots to work out that keep things interesting that last for 2-3 episodes before working themselves out in an entertaining and interesting way.

This is GOOD STUFF.

And when it gets to episodes 8, 9 and 10, make sure you bring a box of tissues.  If this show had been in the US, it would have been a challenger for Best Full Length Show at the Academy Awards.",1373500800,,1947,4.527065527065527

However, there is too much gratiutious and graphic sex and violence (like an episode about cannibals, complete with a butcher shop full of human body parts or another episode about a giant, docile extra terrestrial that is caught in a meat shop and slowly butchered alive).

2956616,5,B000VWE5OY,"I wandered over to Torchwood from Dr Who and the shows share the same ""universe.""  Capt Jack Harkness, the head of this investigative unit based in Cardiff, Wales that supersedes both the police and the govt, first made his appearance in a Dr Who episode.  An enigmatic charming character who isn't at all shy about his sexual interests (both sexes), he is one of the biggest draws for me for Torchwood.

In the first episode, we are also introduced to the other members of Torchwood, who are also each fascinating and strong-willed in their own right and so don't always get along as a team.  Great fodder for the show, definitely, as we explore these characters and their interests and quirks over the course of the series.  They aren't perfect and they don't always get along and they keep secrets from each other.  Plus there is always the mystery of Capt Jack to keep us guessing.

My second favorite, after the incomparable Capt Jack, is Gwen Cooper.  A former cop, she stumbles across Torchwood and just can't leave it alone, eventually finding herself drawn into the world of aliens, alien technology, time travel, and the like.  She is a breath of fresh air, warm and determined, one of the better female tv characters in a long, long time.  She tries to balance her own ""normal"" lifestyle with her boyfriend with the demands and strangeness brought by her association with Torchwood and the people she ends up working with as they deal with the ""rift"" in space and time that sweeps all sorts of oddities into their little pocket of Wales.

The show has adult themes to it at times, so it may not be best for younger viewers without parental oversight or approval.

Highly recommended.  Way more than just a spin-off of Dr Who.",1371168000,,1736,4.671052631578948

You can watch this show without ever having seen ""Dr Who"" but those who know that show will find this much more adult themed with WAY WAY MORE SEX (of various types, pretty graphicly shown) and some pretty strong VIOLENCE too, which is OK for grownup's but you prob do NOT want kids watching this.

I'm Welsh on my father's side, so a show set in Cardiff, with some of the actors having that lovely accent...I was hooked.  And, ""Jack Harkness"" is lovely. :-)  The show is never dull.

2956623,2,B000VWE5OY,"With the exception of two or three episodes, the entire first season is utterly disappointing. How did the original Torchwood team ever get together to begin with?! They don't respect their boss Jack, they don't work well together, they, to a person (except Jack), are out for themselves and do the most STUPID things imaginable for a group that supposedly are professionals and have dealt with aliens and alien technology for at least some time. Gwen, at least, has an excuse for being stupid - she's new and she can get away with it for a few episodes, but neither she, nor any team member have ANY growth or maturity over the entire first season. Almost every problem situation they bring on themselves for being plainly reckless and stupid. The potential for a terrific series is there, but the writing rarely lifts the show beyond marginal sci-fi. If the writers think that because this is a BBC show shown and advertised as 'adult', that by making almost every cast member omni-sexual, adding colorful language and bedroom scenes that this could possibly lift the drama out of the quagmire of painful writing and ridiculous story lines - they are SO mistaken. It's too bad, I actually like the cast, the show looks great in HD, the Torchwood set and locations are nice, the directing is good - but the writing cripples what should be an enjoyable earth-bound sci-fi show. Let's see if season two can redeem the show. If you want to see the show at its best in season one, check out Countrycide and Random Shoes. Then follow that with Captain Jack Harkness and the finale End of Days (although pretty awful, it gives the minor tie-in at the end to Captain Jack's re-appearance in Doctor Who - for you DW fans, like myself).

2956634,1,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is supposed to be this uber-elite team protecting the world from the alien menace.

If they we need them for protection, we are doomed!

They act like a bunch of untrained middle school kids (and no offense to middle school kids, actually I would rather have you protecting us than this pathetic ""team"").

I put team in quotes because they never act like a team. They constantly bicker and feud and turn on each other. And it is obvious that they have never trained to efficiently and professionally undertake the missions that they are supposed to be doing. They seem to just show up at the ""crime scene"", randomly run around, get very lucky, allow the death of multiple civilians and then solve the mystery, more or less.

They're supposed to outrank the police and the military, but they could benefit from taking a little basic training from both.

The worst part of the show is that there is very little consistency from one episode to the next (and sometimes not even within each individual episode).  In one of the early episodes, one of the team members endangers the entire team, directly causes the death of two innocent civilians, directly disobeys the direct orders of the team leader, threatens to kill that same team leader and by his actions threatens to destroy humanity.  Again, the team gets lucky and the menace is dealt with.

Now in real life, the errant team member would be punished. At best, he would be kicked off the team.  But in the world of Torchwood, there are no repercussions.  Even worse, the offending team member exhibits no remorse.

I could go on and on in great detail, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Of course, I shouldn't worry, because I would not want to inflict this nonsense on anyone.  I recommend you not waste your time.

I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I have always like the Doctor.  I liked Jack Harkness' character when he appeared in Doctor Who, but I do not like him in this.

If you want a show that does an excellent job of showing trained and talented individuals protecting humanity from the alien menace, I recommend ""Fringe"".",1368835200,16,2115,4.624664879356568

Also, the aliens are well done. But there are some major drawbacks: too much sex, for one thing. I'm no prude, but all the casual hooking up just detracts from the story line. Also, the fact that Captain Jack is gay is sort of shoved in the viewers' faces repeatedly. We get it, he's gay! Can we move on? The episodes themselves range from excellent to ""meh."" I was either watching breathlessly or stopping after 10 minutes to go to the next episode. Also, the Owen character seems to sort of go off the rails as the season progresses, which is distracting. The fact that Gwen is cheating on her live-in boyfriend with Owen is again something that just pulls you out of the story.

It can be a little bit Graphic at times, which I don't like but I still loved the series. Oh and at least you actually get to see the monsters / aliens and what not.

2956652,3,B000VWE5OY,"I like SciFi stuff. One of the advantages of a Roku with Prime and Netflix, I can try most of them.

I will admit, Torchwood was a slow start for me. I would watch an episode and not find it too interesting. The shows seemed kinda cheesy. After several attempts, it finally got my attention. Mid first season, character development really improves, the writing gets better and some of the cheesiness declines.

Capt. Jack is somewhat irritating at first. He gets less irritating as the show progesses. Also, if you are offended my gay male leads, then you might want to skip this series. However, I think the episode regarding his namesake, where they kissed, was well done. It was one of the best episodes of season one. At the conclusion of season one, the character of Capt. Jack seems to be the biggest negative distraction to the series for me. I am not sure why, he seems almost transparent and does not come across well. His character improves in a few episodes, then the mannequin type acting restarts. Maybe this is one of the side effects of not being able to die.

The other characters do a fine job. No problems.

Some of the 'monsters' have this bad Halloween costume type appearance. Thankfully, these do not dominate the series.

When it comes to mysteries and crime dramas, the UK produces some of the best, if not the best. When it comes to SciFi type shows, the UK puts much less effort into the quality. This spinoff of the Dr. Who series could have been much better done. The writing and special effects are lacking and those accustomed to the US produced SciFi shows will probably be somewhat disappointed.

The first season gets three stars. Not the best but not bad. The last half of the season is by far the better half. I hope season two continues this improvement and turns out to be at least a four star season.

The first three seasons of Torchwood are included with Prime. Season four is not. Season four has ten episodes that cost $2.99 each. So, $30 for season four. Also, Netflix deleted season four for some reason.",1366588800,,2048,4.564032697547684

2956672,5,B000VWE5OY,"Cast very much in the light of ""X-Files"" and ""Fringe,"" the Doctor Who spinoff ""Torchwood"" (an anagram of ""Doctor Who"") follows the adventures of a shadowy team assigned to investigate and, if necessary, prosecute alien interference in current-day England.  From a secret base in London the group deals, in Series 1, with everything from deadly wood sprites to an alien sexual predator.  As might be inferred from those examples, ""Torchwood,"" especially in Series 1, deals regularly with adult themes and is most certainly not for children, but for the young at heart.

Although ""Torchwood"" was introduced through the Doctor Who show, where the lead character, Captain Jack Harkness, was seen in several cameo appearances, this show is not a mere recast of its venerable predecessor.  Rather, Torchwood presents stories from a world in which the Gallifreyan might as easily be perceived as an enemy as an ally, were he to appear, which he does not.

I have a hard time understanding this but the ""butler"", don't remember his name, was responsible for the murder of two people-an innocent woman too! and threatened to kill the team but Jack Harkness and crew had no trouble forgiving him and welcoming him back. The plot is a rehash of the Borg from Star Trek, but the writers made a fundamental mistake, there was no internal struggle for her to be good, even though she wasn't completely upgraded.

He took Torchwood Captain Jack's words to heart and he didn't care what anyone else thought about him dancing and falling in love with a man. You could tell the room respected him for it even though it was so far in the past where it was basically forbidden or it was horrible to be gay.

Torchwood as a show represents many good things. The Torchwood team represents loyalty. The relationships represents many things...it shows it's okay to be gay or bi or straight or (for Captain Jack) omnisexual. It tells people to do what the hell your heart tells you to because, like Captain Jack said, you don't know what day will be your last. Tomorrow you might not wake up, so have a damn good time tonight.

The scene was beautifully orchestrated in every sense. The whole episode was top-notch, but what made this my favortie Torchwood show of all time was the ending.

This second episode sealed the deal for me on watching the rest of the series on Amazon Prime, it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy Doctor Who and want something a little more adult. The beginning sequence says ""The 21st century is where it all changes"" and it doesn't lie, taking place in the 21st century you better believe that we're becoming more accustomed to the thought that sex does, in fact, exist, and it sometimes happens out of marriage!(GASP!SHOCK!)

The plan that the character Suzie thought of is actually very well thought out and complex. It's sort of like a mini full-circle ending, if that makes any sense. Everything that occurred in the very first episode was vital to Suzie's plan. She meant to die...killing herself was all apart of the plan.

The way the writers wrote it and the way the plan and the plot all plays out is very well put-together. It's organized in a way where you don't suspect a thing until...BOOM!!...they reveal the scheme of Suzie's, at the same time surprising the hell out of you. It makes you start thinking and connecting the dots just as they speak. I have to say, this episode is the best I've seen so far of Season 1. I also must include how I think each episode gets better than the one before, like the show, Torchwood, is still a work-in progress. I feel like the directors and writers are telling me ""The show is new, it's a work-in prgress, and it gets better...DONT WORRY!""

The actor who played Ianto, I thought, convinced me of his love for the cyberwoman (although half the episode I was thinking and shouting about how stupid he was...but then again love does make people do stupid things). I liked how Jack was taking charge and forcing everyone to make hard choices. He understands way more than everyone else, especially traveling with the Doctor (that is involved...right?) so i thought John Barrowman's acting was good, as well. This episode was the best so far. At parts it made me sad, angry, and nausiated (especially when Ianto hugged the pizza girl with Lisa's brain...that was really creepy).

I don't really understand the other reviews...I actually liked this episode.",1341792000,,807,5.022388059701493

I figured out that this was because the way film is shot in Europe is different from how it's shot here in the USA. Something about the lines of resolution or some other techie gibberish. Regardless, I like it.

I really love the story lines and the characters; however, I'm still trying to get used to how fast characters are killed off in British shows. I was first introduced to this maddening act in MI-5, and now I'm seeing it in Torchwood. Other than that, the show is a great sci-fi show.",1341619200,,643,4.31404958677686
2956720,3,B000VWE5OY,"If you want, you can skip this season entirely and go directly to the superior Season 2, which makes enough sense without having seen this one.  This Doctor Who spin-off (watching Doctor Who beforehand is not required) concerns a semi-secret (all the locals know they exist, but not what they do) organization called Torchwood, whose mission is to defend Earth against alien invasion.  There's a time-space rift in Cardiff, Wales, so most of the action is based in that area.  The team is led by Captain Jack Harkness (apparently all of this first season takes place before Jack first meets the Doctor.)  We're introduced to Torchwood via Gwen Cooper, a cop, who is recruited into the team in the first episode.  Rounding out the team are Owen, who performs the autopsies, Toshiko (""Tosh""), hacker and gadget girl, and Ianto, who's a... ""tea boy""?

There's apparently a contingent of Ianto fans.  This must be based on later seasons, since the character simply doesn't have much to do this season, with the exception of ""Cyberwoman,"" and the less said about that episode the better.  However, there are two or three lines in that episode that makes it worth watching once.  But only once.
My favorite episode would be ""Out of Time,"" involving 3 folks from the '50's falling through the time-space rift into the present day.  Fans of horror movies may prefer ""Countrycide.""
Ratings wise, there are two ""sex"" (without nudity) episodes, as well as gore, violence, swearing, and Gwen's boyfriend's naked backside, so I'd put it at about an R rating, but a light R,  more towards the PG-13 end of the spectrum rather than the NC-17 end.

But this has definitely been one of the better episodes so far, storywise. They weren't horribly depressing, there wasn't sex for the sake of sex, and the acting wasn't miserable (also I agree with the previous rater and that without Owen this episode got better for me).",1338422400,,635,4.72972972972973

Add it all together you have 'Torchwood'. I watch it somewhat with the same eye that I use when passing a traffic accident. You don't want to look, but you still crane your neck a bit and keep watching. It is very sad.

Ianto should have been terminated at the end simply because he has shown that his own emotions are far more important than the lives of others. He fought for what he wanted to be, not what was. that is dangerous in even an average life, but to put a person in a position of power who is motivated by their sexual rage rather than reality is stupidity. those who can identify with this group are sad and beyond redemption.",1336521600,,612,4.2844827586206895

I really like scifi and powered my way through five seasons of Primeval without a second thought about the usefulness of the time I spent on it but this episode made me feel silly for watching.  The previous reviewers aren't lying, the acting is bad in this one (except the Japanese guy, so the guest actor with the fewest lines did well at least).

Some positives: To be fair, they did a really nice job on the fake body with all the metal stuck through it.  Aces to the prop team, and even though Lisa's metal suit design would look at home on the set of Power Rangers (or Xena) it was at least really well built.  Oh, and the actor who plays Jack was good at acting like he was being electrocuted.  That's all the positives I've got.

As a fan of the Whedonesque shows, as well as other strongly character-driven things like Battlestar Galactica, it was easier to do a lateral entry into Who. Torchwood was perfect for this. The ensemble cast and the Jack Harkness character prepared me for the strange Whovian world. Great monsters of the week, great season plot arcs, brilliant dialogue!",1329868800,,442,4.986486486486487
2956729,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a team centered on its leader, a mysterious man with an unusually long history given his apparent age, and the team he has assembled to manage aliens and deal with apparently supernatural events, some but not all related to a rift in the time-space continuum, which just happens to be located in Cardiff, Wales.  Some sci fi, some fantasy themes, and some truly original ideas.

There is a LOT of variety in the episodes.  Part of this is that they use a variety of writers who have different ideas, but I wonder if perhaps they were instructed to NOT try to make this look like it was all the same writer.  The characters are developed across all episodes and they still make sense with these differing plot lines, but the subject, mood, and purpose of the episodes vary wildly.

Sex plays a role in some of the stories.  It is never very graphic or revealing, but it certainly is not restricted to heterosexuality.  Indeed, the team leader is openly gay, and there is a very romantic story about him and a lover that never quite was, in his distant past.  If it would disturb you to see a romantic or lusty kiss shared between two people of various gender combinations and orientations, this show isn't for you.  I thought it was very nicely done.

On finishing the first season, we decided to go through the various show recaps, which give background about each episode, including details on how they created the visual effects.  I would not call them ""special effects"" in that there is not a lot of computer-rendered animation, rather they show how, for example, a man is hit by a car and goes flying over it.  It is very convincing, and it is interesting and educational to see how they did it by filming various parts and then edited them together carefully.  Although I enjoyed watching the episodes, the recap deepened my appreciation for both the stories and production, based on what the cast and creators had to say about them.

I love listening to the characters speaking the local dialect and with the local accent.  There are phrases and expressions that use English words that are outside of my understanding, thus something to learn.  The downside is that at times I miss what they are saying.  This problem is solved by turning on subtitles, something we do for shows where the local accent sometimes overwhelms understanding (The Wire is another example).  But having the words up makes it easier to learn from the way they talk.

Overall it is a very good series, and we're enjoying it a lot (now in Season 2).  It makes up for its flaws with truly creative ideas and acting.  It is not destined to find its place among my all-time favorites, but it is very entertaining and well worth watching, though quite variable.

Torchwood is an anagram of a famous and long-running BBC serial in which the central figure of Torchwood was first introduced.

In one of the episodes, no less than three of their team members have guns on the bad guys and they STILL get disarmed by their own incompetence (namely, one of the characters is having a conscience issue with shooting a self proclaimed mass murderer).  The dialogue is idiotic and the plots are what you'd expect from a 6th grade sci fi fan (I'm thinking like beevus and butthead, ""heh, heh, let's make a female alien who kills people with sex, heh, heh...).

We see all of these fantastic personalities at work in this episode. The tension throughout is fantastic and the dialogue and acting is to die for. If you're wondering where to start to get you really hooked on Torchwood this may be the perfect episode for you.

The cast members don't play the extreme melodramatic parts that this episode could have devolved toward, and they really seem to struggle to come to their decisions and to stick with them.

He's not quite a Time Lord yet, just another schmuck caught in a bizarre loop of cosmic wonder while carnage and Armageddon storm down a shadowy alley. They get rid of narcissus-lizard Owen, which is an improvement, but they also get rid of Sato, not so great. But Jack is still around, and his maddeningly perfect features make up for his maddeningly perfect features. Gwen evolves from curious imp into bossy denmother, and sadly the sexual tension between her and Jack is put on the back burner because of faulty contraceptives. But Torchwood: Miracle Day promises more of the same but with palm trees and probably American guest stars.
My absolute favorite parts of Torchwood are the graphics and the theme music. The opening theme has got great spooky vocals, the closing theme is this amazing eclectic mash-up that uses elements of the original Dr. Who theme. But the show is OK.

As for the service -

I am someone who has been a regular Amazon customer since 1997 and, yet, I have avoided Amazon Prime.  It now appears that there is some kind of advantage to being a Prime member where video is concerned.

The actor himself was raised in Illinois so he should have an American accent right?  So then why does he pronounce some words like the brits do?

Examples:

In episode 1 he pronounced the word Estrogen ""E-stro-gen"" instead of ""eh-stro-gen""  and in this episode he said ""Pee-do-file"" instead of ""Ped-a-file"".

2956760,1,B000VWE5OY,"There are two traps into which a spinoff of a popular show can fall.  It can either lean so heavily on the show off of which it spun that it never escapes that show's shadow and becomes nothing more than a pale imitation of a much better program (Sarah Jane Adventures), or it can go to the other extreme and bear so little resemblance to the original that there's nothing to draw in fans from the parent show.

Torchwood here falls into the latter trap.  You've got Jack Harkness, the always bad-ass part time companion to the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, to attract DW fans; but once you get past him, there's no Dr Who here.  There are stray references to this and that minor element of the revival; the hand which the Doctor lost in ""The Christmas Invasion"" is kept in a jar in the background; and Jack makes cryptic reference to his desire to find ""the right kind of doctor"" in the pilot and again in the finale.  There's an episode that's about Cybermen . . . sort of.  (Actually, it's no less about the Cybermen than most of the Cybermen episodes of Tenant's run were.)  But this Doctor Who spinoff bears no meaningful resemblance to Doctor Who.

That's not a bad thing necessarily, of course, if the show can turn into something interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, it doesn't, not in this case.  The cast of characters pretty much kills it. Of the four original characters, Owen is an unlikeable jerk who's got the obnoxiousness of half a dozen Donna Nobles and all the redeeming virtues of John Simm's--no, Eric Roberts's!--Master, while Gwen, Tosh, and Ianto (Geez, who came up with these names?) are just uninteresting dweebs. As for Jack, Barrowman makes the character such a joy to watch when he's in a Doctor Who episode, but for the most part he seems to be just phoning it in here.

The season does manage some good episodes. The pilot was certainly an enjoyable watch, and the next episode, which chronicled Gwen's first day on the job, was interesting.  (Gwen joins Jack as a first-tier character; the other three are distinctly less important. I won't say they're the Scotty and Sulu to Jack and Gwen's Kirk and Spock, but if you watch the opening titles and notice that the other three actors' names appear to be separated from Barrowman's and Eve Myles's by several blank lines, you'll see what I mean.)  This episode was about an alien who had a sexual obsession, and it was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, the sexual obsession set the tone for the rest of the season, but more on that in just a bit.

From there on out most of the better episodes are driven by guest stars--and there are some good guest characters in here.  There were a couple of episodes whose plots didn't rely on any characters, but on phenomena. One dealing with fairies felt like it could have been an okay Doctor Who episode, and I suspect it would have been quite good if it had brought in DW elements, but Jack tries to solve it on his own and it leaves the episode with the sense of a potentially good idea not realized.  There's the Cybermen episode I mentioned above, which was only so-so on an objective standard but shines a lot brighter due to its less-than-lustrous companions.  ""Countrycide"" is a disturbing one.  (By the way, according to the Wiki it's the first episode in the DW universe to involve no science fiction elements other than a time traveller who's not what he seems since the Fifth Doctor story ""Black Orchid,"" which was itself a throwback to the straight historicals of the William Hartnell era, when the show was supposed to be educational.)

Most of the episodes focus on a regular character and try to kick off a character arc.  This makes sense for the first season of a new show, but the results are not pretty.  We don't really get an episode on Jack, partly because we already know him from his Doctor Who appearances and partly because, for the purposes of this show, he's got a real air of mystery about him that would dissipate if his teammates learned what makes him tick.  (And maintaining this mystery for the characters without frustrating curious audiences is almost the only thing that this season does well.)  There IS an episode titled ""Captain Jack Harkness,"" and that one features Barrowman to about the same extent that the various character episodes starred the actors playing the characters being focused on, but it's not about Jack.  It's about the other Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity was stolen by the Jack we all know of love when he first landed in the Battle of Britain to attempt to con the Doctor, right before the events of ""The Empty Child.""

Each of the other four gets at least one episode to try to develop their characters, but this is where the show really falls apart. As I alluded to above, there's a tremendous amount of sex here. Now Torchwood is specifically advertised for adults-only audiences, so that's not objectionable in and of itself.  Sex is often a useful tool for advancing the plot of adult fiction, and certainly a little gratuitous sex never killed anyone, but they go way overboard with it on this show.  Sex is the only vehicle used for any kind of characterization, and it REALLY wears thin.  (Interestingly enough, Jack--who's notorious among the Ninth and Tenth Doctors and their companions for flirting with any man, woman, or alien he meets, unless duty has forced upon him some urgent need to keep his mind on other things--shows no more interest in sex on this show than most normal real-world adults, despite being both surrounded and WRITTEN by nymphomaniacs.)

Gwen has a season-long subplot in which her lover--a genuinely nice guy named Rhys, and the only recurring original character a viewer is likely to develop any sympathy or affinity for--gradually grows less and less willing to accept the unpredictable hours of Gwen's new job--all he knows is that she's working for a kind of ""special ops""--and especially the evasiveness and dishonesty that creeps into their relationship as Gwen's life becomes increasingly affected by stuff that's confidential.  This very nearly worked, and would have, if the writers had portrayed Gwen as being torn between the equally valid demands of love and duty.  Unfortunately, on this show, anything interesting gets traded in for an extra dose of sex, so Gwen uses this secrecy to conceal the fact that she's taken another lover.  (That's not a spoiler, by the way; the audience learns of it almost immediately.  Only poor Rhys is left in the dark.)

The three second-tier characters each get an episode where a lover pops up out of nowhere and leads them to question their loyalties to Torchwood. We learn next to nothing about the characters this way.  In fact, I'm having a hard time thinking of a cheaper way to do characterization, and that's made even worse in the cases of Tosh and Ianto, whose characters are more or less reset to what they'd been originally almost immediately and go through the remainder of the season only minimally changed.  As for Owen, he becomes an even bigger jerk after his short-term lover leaves him, setting up a two-episode arc which I'm going to spoil below because it illuminates just how badly these characters can ruin a story.

As I said, Owen's short-term lover leaves him and this drives him to become an even bigger jerk. In the penultimate episode he goes against Jack's orders and does something incredibly stupid and dangerous, killing hundreds of people in the process. In the finale, the ripples of his decision quickly get away from him and he indignantly demands that Jack clean up his mess.  Jack starts by firing him for insubordination, though the other Torchwood members make half-hearted attempts to save Owen's job (instead of standing up and cheering, like the audience is doing).

Jack's having no luck fixing things, and then Owen barges back in and proposes doing something that will make the situation even worse.  Jack is prepared to use force to stop him but Owen gets the other three to mutiny. Jack reminds each of them why they suck and they respond by killing him--something that's happened quite a few times this season.  You'll recall that ever since Time Vortex-possessed Rose revived him after he bought it against the Daleks in ""The Parting of Ways,"" he's been immortal and recovers from all forms of deadly injury in seconds.  In this one case, though, he stays dead for several minutes, which gives Owen and Friends the opportunity to release a spawn of Satan on the Earth, as per Revelation--which seems pretty out of place considering that a good deal of the season was spent not-so-subtly pushing an atheist agenda.

What follows is a five-minute fight with a fake-looking city-stomping monster.  The whole thing feels more like an episode of Underdog than either Doctor Who or any of the other shows to which Torchwood has been favorably compared: The X-Files, CSI, a few others. The ending is pat. Jack dies and undies again, even more slowly this time because he'd run the immovable object of his immortality up against an irresistable force, the Death Lord. Then he again makes reference to ""the right kind of doctor.""  Almost immediately, the Doctor's hand starts glowing, we hear the sound of the TARDIS, and Jack runs off.

Since I watched all of Doctor Who before turning my attention to Torchwood, I know he's running off to return to a much better show and to take part in one of its best story arcs, the return of the Master for the twenty-first century revival. (I had always wondered where he was coming from in such a hurry in the opening scene of ""Utopia."") Unfortunately, no sooner did I remember this than the disappointment I felt when he turned down the chance to resume being a companion at the end of ""Last of the Time Lords"" was retroactively enhanced by realizing that he was just going back for another season of more of this crap.  I doubt I'll be joining him.

Sorry to spoil the season finale, but I feel it was necessary to show just how bad this season was.  I wouldn't quite say it should be avoided at all costs, but if you watch it expecting anything other than bland sci fi adventures and oversexed losers, you're in for a big disappointment.",1308441600,9,10227,4.7044307347167695
2956761,3,B000VWE5OY,"I watched this episode thanks to Amazon's streaming and it was worth the price ($0).

While there were some interesting twists in the plot, it seems as though I've seen the devices in many of the horror movies that I used to think were originals (a notion that age and experience have helped alleviate). The trapped couple fighting against a maniac, the rest of their crew of unsuspecting campers trying to figure out what's going on, a village overtaken by a combination of madness and (perhaps) hereditary insanity, and a truncated ending are not very original. Such things, to me, point to a show that is in decline or is trying to ""reach out"" to those who might not be familiar with the show's heritage and its plot divergence (thanks to Captain Jack) from Doctor Who.

All told, it's not a bad episode. But for me, at least, the trite cliches and absurdly predictable plot leave a lot to be desired. From its heritage I would have expected social criticism and an hour of de-tangling them from the overall structure of the story once the narrative was over. This is not the case--less than 10 minutes later I'm writing this review.

For the price of $0, it's not a bad episode, but packing a bunch of old ideas in a shiny new box doesn't impress me as it used to. I'm starting to feel like this series is more like a soap opera and less like something I'll remember after I finish this review. Perhaps it's my age, but hasn't entertainment evolved since such limited contrivances?",1308268800,,1485,4.575187969924812

I am very glad that I have procured this seven (7) disc set with thirteen (13) episodes.  I found this season to be most exciting with many splendid and ""eye popping"" special effects and some very fascinating characters.  I especially adore the character of Captain Jack Harkness, as played by John Barrowman who is the leader of the ""Alien catching"" team.  Barrowman is very tough but so suave--he's great.

It was painfully bad, lots of overly dramatic acting in emotional situations.  Characters were either completely emotional or completely unemotional from scene to scene.  The exception is that the Captain was more well acted.  Camera work is certainly sub-par, though it is comparable to others of the BBC in picture quality it is not in handling.  Somehow I watched episode 12 rather than the 1st but I think this gave me the best idea of how bad it could be.  While this is not going to matter to everyone the main character, the Captain, is gay and you will at least watch men kissing.  I know that doesn't matter to everyone but if it does bother you there is the heads up.  Overall I think the show is a overly dramatic version of Doctor Who",1307145600,3,904,4.430303030303031
2956764,5,B000VWE5OY,"Like, the title of this review says, just...wow.  I have just finished watching the entire series and I LOVED it.  I had heard of the show before, but never gave it much thought.  I've always been a fan of the X-Files and CSI, which this show is somewhat similar to, but I just never really watched it.  I'm glad I decided to give the first episode a try...I was hooked from the start.

What I especially love is the writing and the acting.  Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper is great.  She is probably the heart of the show.  Sure, John Barrowman is the lead character, but Eve somehow just gives the show heart.  Don't get me wrong; John is incredible in his role as Captain Jack.  I never saw the show Dr. Who, so I can't really compare him to what he was like on that show.  I think that the episode that stands out for me is ""The Keep Killing Susie"".  I loved the twists and turns in that episode; just when you think she (Susie) is dead...she's not and we have no idea why until the final 20 minutes or so of the episode.

Torchwood is definitely a darker drama/action/sci-fi and every now and then humorous show.  I just hope I am able to watch the fourth season in some way.  It's going to air on a channel that I do not get and hopefully BBC America will still be able to pick it up (or it'll maybe be available on Amazon Instant Video...???).

2956766,5,B000VWE5OY,"Often touted as the ""darker/more adult"" Doctor Who (which, to be fair, is more ""family-friendly"" than for children _per se_), Torchwood is arguably a different sort of show in its own right. The setting is Earth and the focus a group of humans grappling with the unknown in the form of a rift in space and time--situated right on Cardiff--that regularly spews forth all manner of alien species and technology. Originally formed by Queen Victoria as a counter to the supposed threat to the Earth represented by the Doctor and other alien life forms (and with an agenda of British imperialism above all else), Torchwood has since been reformed by Captain Jack Harkness in tribute to the Doctor's more humane, multicultural and egalitarian ideals.

Which doesn't make the ride an easy one for our protagonists--as one might imagine, with relative free reign (few even in the government are aware of Torchwood's purpose and existence) and powerful tech at their disposal, moral conundrums abound. The very first episode demonstrates the temptations of the job, as well as the moral and mental toll it can take upon fallible human beings.

In accordance with the show's opening narrated by Jack, that ""the 21st century is when everything changes"", expect your prejudices and beliefs to be somewhat challenged by this show. Moral ambiguity, hard choices and fluid sexuality abound (not entirely surprising for a show broadcast during the ""watershed"" time period for more adult fare). The Welsh setting adds colour and reminds us of the regular people and everyday routines of life being protected by Torchwood (and, I must admit, has caused me to fall a little bit in love with this part of the world).

To sum up, a somewhat darker offering than some Doctor Who watchers may be accustomed to. But like a good chiaroscuro painting, the moments of darkness make the moments of light stand out that much more--particularly through the character of PC Gwen Cooper, recruited in the first episode as much for her empathy and humanity as for her bravery and perseverance. Make no mistake, these are the ""good guys"", warts and all, putting their lives and sanity on the line for the sake of the human race.",1303516800,5,2194,4.940379403794038

Here in the USA (mid-USA anyway) Doctor Who has always been a show that I could recommend to families.. where the parents and Kids (and now my grandkids) can watch together and laugh at the old special effects and the jump at the new ones. I know of many Families who wouldn't be watching if Doctor Who had the crap of Torchwood going on!

I really don't even want people know that I watched Torchwood! But I must WARN others!
I bought it cause Capt. Jack was on Doctor Who. I thought it would be clean (sheeesh!)
 When I got online and complained to someone in a WHO talk thread somewhere else...
They said it got ""way better"" in the ""Children of the Earth"" .. well ...
I guess.... ""Way Better"" is really subjective.  It did get better ... but not ""WAY"" better.
I needed a bath after watching!
I DELETED the whole lot of ""Torchwood"" from my Online Video Library

I liked the fact that Gwen finally told her husband what she was doing and that he could share in the job!
That sharing cemented their relationship! I loved that part!

Else - Torchwood was trash! If they bring Torchwood back CLEAN .. I will be a fan. You betcha!
Story line was pretty good take out the TRASH (Sexual content (both hetro & homo) & language though.
A little less gore would be good too!

You can elude to raunchy withOUT really putting it in. I can fill in where there might be something with non-raunchy stuff. Kids wouldn't have the experience to do this. They would just see the story.

I have a great imagination. Yeppers I do! HA!

I just got done watching TORCHWOOD Season 4 Episode 1 ""Miracle Day""
I gotta say I was really pleasantly surprised!!!
NO Explicit Sexual Content! Not too much swearing!! A little gore but it kind of fit cause you had to show people having really bad accidents that normally would have caused them to be killed instantly .... so it wasn't too much as to detract.

In fact, the show is almost entirely dedicated to exploring the group members' misuse and abuse of their positions. And in so doing, it is quite compelling. The 'They keep killing Suzie' explores just how deeply a team member abused her position; it may be the best episode of the season. The episodes that don't focus on team misbehavior, e.g., the 'aliens need sex' and 'countrycide' episodes, are among the weakest.

2956786,3,B000VWE5OY,"This is a review with a bit of a difference considering I've never watched a single episode of Doctor Who in my life (I'll get to it eventually), despite knowing that ""Torchwood"" is a spin-off of that entertainment juggernaut, and in fact derives its name from an anagram of its mother show. But I'd been told that knowledge of the prior show was not strictly necessary, and thought perhaps I'd be able to watch with fresh eyes and without inevitably drawing comparisons with the original show.

Gwen Cooper is a young police officer who happens to be present when a crime scene is interrupted by a mysterious group of people who are offhandedly referred to as Torchwood by her colleges. She watches in astonishment from a nearby car-park building as the team use a gauntlet to temporarily resurrect the murder victim, and begins her own private investigation into discovering who exactly these people are.

Turns out that Torchwood is a secret organization ""outside the government, beyond the police"" which is led by the enigmatic, charismatic, long coat-wearing Captain Jack Harkness, who is intrigued by Gwen's disapproving point of view on their activities. After being introduced to the rest of the team: Doctor Owen Harper, computer genius Toshiko Sato, faithful butler Ianto Jones, and second-in-command Suzie Costello; Gwen learns that there's a rift in space and time over Cardiff, resulting in an influx of aliens, time-travel and other bizarre occurrences that require a specialized team of experts to deal with. That's where Torchwood comes in.

Unexpected tragedy means that a space opens up on the team, and Jack invites Gwen to join in order to infuse some degree of humanity in the business-like dealings of the Torchwood team. She agrees; a decision that will change her life forever. Thirteen episodes in all, the show purports to be a grownup sci-fi show that melds the detective work of CSI with plenty of sex, gore and violence. For the most part the episodes are standalone, with little continuity between them (unless you count the meaningless entanglements that the staff have with each other or with one-shot guest stars), and many of them follow basic sci-fi storylines. There's the one with the parasitic alien, the time-traveling visitors, the alien fight club, the device which reads minds, etc.

Yet when the show finds its feet, it suddenly becomes very, very good. Jack Harkness is an intriguing character with a mysterious past and an immunity to death. His agenda suggests that he knows more than he's letting on, whilst simultaneously being just as baffled about his own existence as the rest of his team. The scenes that centre on him and John Barrowman's boisterous, enthusiastic, larger-than-life performances are invariably the scenes worth tuning in for. Other episodes such as ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" have intricate plots, nuanced characterization and themes on the nature of life and the cost of immorality that are truly thought-provoking.

To make a long story short, the first season of Torchwood is a mixed bag. There's plenty of potential, and lots of pay-off, but the characterization and general content are often frustrating. For the record, I don't consider three stars a ""bad"" review by any means, but to my mind at least, the biggest detriments of the show are threefold.

As mentioned, the show tries to pass itself off as ""adult"" by making it a darker and edgier version of Doctor Who. Here's the rub: the process of making something ""darker and edgier"" has been interpreted as ""adding more sex, profanity and violence."" This does not automatically make a show more adult, in fact it has the opposite effect and can make it seem quite juvenile at times. Despite repeated claims by writers and producers in the DVD extras that their use of sex and violence is not gratuitous, most of the time it *is* gratuitous and serves no real purpose beyond giving the writers the opportunity to point at the screen and say: ""look at how edgy we're being!""

Another serious problem is the fact that many of characters simply aren't very likeable: not in the ""flawed but human"" way, but in the ""what a jerk!"" way. Essentially, most of them act like irresponsible and immature children, only with sex drives that they can't seem to keep in check. The drama of the show doesn't derive from characters grappling with moral conundrums or with the weight of the responsibility placed on them, but from their inability to keep their pants on. The relationships they foster are shallow and meaningless, and the audience is given little reason to care about any of them.

In particular, the focus of the show keeps coming back to Gwen and Owen. Although Tosh is a cool intellectual and Ianto is a sweetheart, the writers seem to be more interested in making most of the plots revolve around Gwen and Owen; the former an inconsistent character who never seems to do the job that she was hired for, and the latter a complete jerk. Gwen is apparently meant to be the empathetic one, but this usually involves her trusting the wrong people, getting aggravated with her team mates when she feels they're not being compassionate enough, and cheating on her boyfriend.

Owen is meant to be a dark, smooth ladies man, except that the actor isn't really handsome or charming enough to pull it off, and in his first appearance he's using an alien aphrodisiac to entice strangers into having sex with him. Wow, just like a sex offender with date-rape pills! Later he makes a rather disgusting proposition to Gwen whilst he has her forcibly pinned against a tree, and by the end of the episode they're sleeping together. Even Jack, ostentatiously the main character, is marginalized in favor of these two.

Finally there are also some things that just plain don't make sense. If Torchwood is a secret organization, why do they drive around in a giant SUV with flashing lights and blaring music? Why is this team of ""experts"" so ridiculously incompetent and disorganized? What exactly is it that they do that couldn't be done just as easily by the local police force? If they're above the government, where do they get their funding? (admittedly, the answer to this may lie in Doctor Who, where it was first introduced). Why do they have a pterodactyl flying around their headquarters, and who cleans up after it? Is it just a coincidence that they're all bi-sexual or is it something to do with the rift? (I just think four out of five bi-curious characters are rather unlikely odds).

Yet my three-star review does not mean that I think the show is bad - not by any means. The episodes, whatever else their faults, are fast-paced, well acted and built on a solid premise. There is room for much improvement, but the promise is there, and (according to general opinion) is acted upon in the second season.

This DVD box set boasts some exceptional extras: along with the usual deleted scenes, outtakes, making of featurettes, and interviews with the cast and crew, it also has a commentary track for every single episode, something I've never seen before (usually they opt for just one or two). There's even a segment in which John Barrowman grabs hold of a microphone and belts out ""Anything Goes"" for a 1930s audience. The enthusiasm and care with which the cast and crew discuss the show is contagious, and it's difficult to really condemn a show that so many people obviously enjoy being a part of. Although I was not hugely impressed by Torchwood's first offering, I'm sufficiently intrigued to give season two a try.",1285027200,11,7545,4.876755070202808

It's unfortunate because the trend ruined stand-outs like ""Sliders"" after it's first two seasons.  I didn't dislike like Torchwood, but it seems to offer nothing original nor has any particular strong points; if one takes away the ""flash"", there is little left.  As an example - The first show after the opener is very similar to a ""New Outer Limits"" show staring Alisa Milano(sp).  She was possessed by an alien that wanted sexual energy; Torchwood just re-presented this theme with more ""flash"" different cast and venue.  The ""Outer Limits"" version spent more time on character development and plot, the actors were more engaging and it was simply a better (deeper, richer) story (and I'm not that much of a fan of the New Outer Limits).  Torchwood seems geared to ""entertain"" a certain demographic, and it's following a formula to do it.  The series is not up to what one would expect from the BBC with respect to story quality and acting.  I may have been somewhat entertained, but it's basically junk food.",1269820800,2,1129,4.783505154639175
2956790,4,B000VWE5OY,"""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series, shown in the United States on BBC America.

The series is a ""Doctor Who"" spin off. While ""Doctor Who"" is considered a family show, ""Torchwood"" is more adult in content. It contains explicit sex, gruesome murders and some pretty nasty aliens. Most characters turn out to be bisexual. Indeed, the fictitious Torchwood Institute seems to be a veritable LGBT love fest!

The closest thing ""Star Trek"" ever came to homosexuality were a couple of strange alien races. ""Torchwood"" is the real thing. How about same-sex kissing between Allied officers in pretty uniforms (one of them a time traveller), interracial lesbian sex with a shape shifting alien, or swinging from a straight robot to a gay human? Well, at least they have diversity on this show!

Weirdly, the plot is set in Cardiff, Wales. Hardly a place anyone would consider the gay capital of Britain. The story revolves around the Torchwood Institute, a secretive operation charged with hunting down aliens from outer space and retrieve alien technology. The leader of the operation is one Jack Harkness, a mysterious human with supernatural abilities whose real identity is never revealed in the first season (of course, avid viewers of ""Doctor Who"" know exactly who he is). A rift in space-time runs right across Cardiff, turning the city into some kind of alien boomtown. Most fascinating are the Weewils, monstrous aliens living in the sewage system but occasionally making it to the surface, attacking people. To make the story a little bit more believable, the Torchwood Institute controls a drug known as Retcon, which wipes out the memories of everyone who ever sees the aliens. Torchwood are, after all, above the government and beyond the police!

So far, three seasons of ""Torchwood"" has been produced. I originally only watched the second season, and drew the hasty conclusion that the show isn't much to write home about. The last couple of weeks, I've also been watching the first season episodes on Swedish TV. They are much better. In the second season, the monsters are just too corny and the characters too weirdly depressed. One of them even becomes a zombie. The first season also borders the corny at times (what about the cannibals? Or Abaddon?), but overall it's perfectly acceptable.

Unless, of course, you have a problem with bisexuals...",1268870400,2,2369,5.048593350383632

This is not intended for children and may even be too much for the PG-13 crowd; it is great story telling for adults and does not dumb down the show for its audiences - something that many Americans will find uncomfortable at first, but then will be highly disappointed by the production and story telling of American broadcasting and cable fair.

Sadly instead of bringing us the show as it was intended, FOX plans to create an Americanized knock off which will once again, as with ""the office"" be good but still not be likely to match the quality and story telling of the original series:  it is truly a shame that broadcasters in the US do not respect their audiences enough to air overseas hit shows as they are and not ""fix them"" for us.

2956793,3,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is an anagram of and series spin off of the 'Doctor Who' franchise.  Dr. Who was awesome to such a point where I was interested in even the ancillary shows, so I viewed Torchwood, hoping for more.  No luck.  What really makes Dr. Who great is the acting and characterization of the Doctor himself.  Torchwood has nothing like him.  It's budget is low, the Weevils are silly, and the relationships are a mess.

The relationships, let me go into them more.  If male/male and female/female is your thing, you'll love Torchwood.  In the first season every one of the five main characters gets a same sex kiss, and often more, much more.  'Edgy,' which should not be confused for 'good plot' or 'good acting.'  Now this is something I could live with if the science fiction element was as strong or interesting as Dr. Who.  A couple episodes which didn't concentrate on the main cast like 'Random Shoes' and 'Small Worlds' were really good.  They carry the show up to three stars for me.

Probably the biggest dislike I had for the show was how Captain Jack Harkness reacted to his subordinates.  They don't follow his orders.  They don't listen to him.  He's 'in charge' only during the tense chases when they have a clearly defined enemy.  As soon as a decision comes along which doesn't have immediate consequences, they ignore his orders.  This never ends well, and by series finale, become more of a question of 'Why are these people still employed at Torchwood?'

A number of people have commented negatively on the persistent sex (mostly kissing and talking about sex -- very little else happens on camera), which personally I think is one of the best things about the show.  It's pleasantly silly & over the top, especially coming from Captain Jack.  Admittedly if you're offended by characters breathing heavily at each other, this is not a series you will enjoy.  To me the one enormous negative is the character of Gwen Cooper.  She's unbearable.  Gooey brown eyes that round with hurt or surprise at every opportunity.  Empathy that bleeds out of her in ridiculous directions. Snuggle-bunny-ness with boring boyfriend.  Guilt, guilt at not being able to be home for dinner.  I find myself muttering ""silly cow"" almost every time she does or says anything.  She can't even turn her phone off when she's hiding from an alien. Silly cow.  The other female character, Tosh, is only mildly pathetic, and all the males are entertaining in different ways.

And love is more important to Jack than sex (although, in the second episode, we find out that he'll bonk anything that moves).  For anyone who doesn't know it, this series is a spin-off the the newest Dr. Who series.

But, there are other things, too.  The fact the series (1) isn't set in space; (2) not set in a big city (Cardiff is about the same size as the city I live in) and (3) Barrowman and his co-stars make the stories feel real.

The characters live and die.  They have real lives that we learn about, which makes us understand them more fully.  There is laughter, loss, powerful stories and stories that can keep you on the edge of your seat (even if it is an uncomfortable way to watch anyone).

2956802,5,B000VWE5OY,"Looked at in the whole of his work, Russell T. Davies used his run as executive producer of Doctor Who (2005-2008) to expand the universe surrounding the Time Lord.  Using the Doctor Who anthology as a jumping off point, Davies was able to build the premise that brought Elizabeth Sladen back into the Family of Time as a more mature Sarah Jane Smith...and through the first two series of Doctor Who, built the foundation that led to Torchwood; using ""The Unquiet Dead"" , ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" and ""Bad Wolf/Parting Of The Ways"" from Series One; then ""Tooth And Claw"" and ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday"" for establishing the hows and whys for the Institute.
  It's obvious that the BBC decided that that, in spinning off one of the characters from a reimaging of The Doctor, the one that HAD to be spun off was Jack Harkness.  As portrayed by John Barrowman, Captain Jack was too handsome, too tragically heroic, too charismatic...and too adventurous (Both in his work and his off hours) to NOT have a storyline built around him.  In many ways, Captain Jack is another vision of the Doctor; sort of an off-kilter reflection that one might see in a Hall of Mirrors.  Jack is immortal but wishes for death, a leader who demands his team follow his leadership yet keeps secrets of his past (Their future) from them...Barrowman has matured Jack from his introduction...SOME.  Certainly, he is a more severe and understanding human in Cardiff than he was during his time on the TARDIS...and this plays out over the 13 episodes.
  Barrowman's equal in this series is the brilliant Eve Myles as the police constable turned Torchwood police liaison Gwen Cooper.  Cooper, a descendant of the housemaid Gwyneth from ""The Unquiet Dead"" (Something that was retconned in Series Four of Doctor Who), observes Torchwood reanimate a corpse in the series opener (""Everything Changes""), and begins a winding trail to--oddly enough--becoming somewhat of a ""Companion"" to Jack.  Myles is an oddly attractive woman--once she gets out of the PC uniform and into regular clothing, she has a wonderful body with that odd gap between the front of her upper teeth--which somehow makes her more human and appealing.  Gwen's adjustment to working at Torchwood--the sequence in ""Ghost Machine"" in which Jack teaches her how to user firearms--makes Gwen almost seem a natural for the unique mission of Torchwood.
  The rest of the Torchwood team--the medical specialist Owen Harper (Given an angry, arrogant edge by Burn Gorman--at least until ""Out Of Time""), the computer/systems specialist Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori, played as a bit of a wallflower save ""Greeks Bearing Gifts""; in which we find out she holds a torch for Owen) and the administrative specialist Ianto Jones (Gareth Lloyd-Davies, who never seems to have a hair out of place or his suit out of joint--well, except for ""Cyberwoman"" and ""Countrycide"") round out Torchwood Three.

  Torchwood is a series that delves into the seamier side of Doctor Who's world.  The basic premise of the Torchwood Institute--a first line of defense on Earth against aliens (Aliens in this case defined as beings from other planets AND dimensions in time and space) allows for the issues that might inhabit any law-enforcement unit--relationships (How Gwen cannot tell her boyfriend, Rhys Williams, what she does...or as the season goes on, who she's sleeping with), the usage of what the team garners through the rift, and the potential for corruption from those items.  This is the theme of the first episode, in which the usage of one of the items...and it's corruptive, corrosive nature...leads to the death of one member of the team...and opens up the spot that Gwen fills.  From then on, the season veer wildly--aliens consuming bodies during sex, devices opening portals to the past, cannibals, fairies that aren't all sweet and nice, mind reading devices...oh yeah, and demons looking to consume all life.
  Overall, Torchwood is a wonderfully different take on the Whoniverse.  It is at times sadder, a little more visceral, and definitely more intense.  Barrowman and Myles give the series a heft and weight that couldn't be displayed in Doctor Who.  But that weight and intensity is why Davies gave this series a run...and it works.

I gotta say.. everyone does a great job with the acting, aside from Captain Jack. (John Barrowman) He just seems to be WAY over-doing every line and action.

2956804,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood, is as the product editorial says is a spin off of Doctor Who, but unlike most spin offs, you do not need to watch or follow Doctor Who to watch it as it is truly self-contained.

Torchwood is kind of like the the British version of X-Files, if it was created and aired by HBO.  Basically that means that there is a lot of stuff that has been touched on like same-sex relationships and romance to affairs, but at the same time never leaving the scope of the plot, so you are not bogged down by these scenes.  Every episode is basically contained with in themselves so the story lines does not really follow each episode.  There are the exceptions like with the two part episodes, or when they have to bring back something to help bring a story around.

But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds.  Take the butler like guy.  In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden int he basement. She's half robot.

Season II:

He and the Captain become lovers.

It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't.  You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.

Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend.  She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood.  It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.

If that is what I wanted to see I'd watch Soaps.",1242777600,7,1276,4.30801687763713

2956808,3,B000VWE5OY,"Too often an episode of Torchwood reaches its climax with Captain Jack standing in a column of irradiated light, his handsome features contorted in pain, screaming either, ""pen the Rift!"" or ""Close the Rift!""  Since we never did figure out what the Rift was nor why it should be either opened or closed, we haven't yet come close to the ideal experience of Torchwood which, on the face of it, should be one of our very favorite shows.

It has, seemingly, everything, an unusual location, a provocative theme, some passable acting, a good looking cast, and that Doctor Who pedigree.  And how many shows use anagrams in their title, so that's cool!  And yet whenever it begins, I get distracted, looking at Owen's unappealingly foxy face; the little twerp is supposed to be the sexyboy on the show, but to me he looks like a pocket version of the late Don Knotts.  Then there's Eve Myles, gorgeous and gaptoothed as Gwen.  In Season One she quits her job on the regular police force to join up with Torchwood, the secret branch.  Either they present some episodes out of order on the DVD, or Gwen forgets she's married whenever it's convenient for the writers (if she's not married to the guy at home, forgive me for not understanding the Welsh).

Torchwood's mission, to repel aliens, seems boring after a bit.  And xenophobic and nationalistic.  Why are the aliens uniformly presented as unattractive, in fact evil freaks?  Is this how outsiders are welcomed in Cardiff?  Then excuse me if I stay home, despite the way the city skyline and marina have been photoshopped to picture postcard perfection for the filming.  As for Ianto or whatever his name is, on any other show he'd be an extra; here requiring him to memorize and say lines smacks of exploitation.

Still we're sort of hooked and have started Season Two with hopes still high.",1241136000,,1840,4.7272727272727275

He flirted with everyone and had a great time doing it. Of course, they were going to make a spinoff.

And then the spinoff came and it turned Jack into a dull school marm in a classroom full of bland creeps. The first four episodes are pretty good but eventually it becames too apparent that Gwen, a miserable Mary Sue character, is going to be the center of the show. And she's awful. She has to always be on some kind of sermonizing moral trip. When she ""accidentally"" kills someone (who by the plotline fully deserves it) she gets weepy. When she is in a situation where it's kill or be killed - she decides to drop her gun and wait for Jack to rescue her.

And then halfway through the season the show decides to explore the rest of the cast. And they are even more boring. Tosh is sad. Owen is a jerk. Ianto has a sexy cyberwoman girlfriend. He's been hiding her in the Torchwood basement for over a year and somehow no one has noticed.

Even more fun, RTD just hits us over the head with his two sermons - pacifism and atheism. The former is typically hypocritical since he can't seem to write a character that might NOT deserve death to save his life. The latter is just irritating. How many characters can die and come back to life and go ""There's NOTHING out there""?? Got it.

2956810,2,B000VWE5OY,"I am a huge Doctor Who fan for over 30 years and just started watching the first few episodes of Torchwood. I was warned about its edge and sexuality, so was not surprised at some of the content. Overall the series could be a lot better. I agree with most reviewers about the homosexual and athiest overtones. I don't have a problem with gay characters or references, but in Torchwood's first few episodes all the gay and bi-sexual content does nothing to advance the plot. The atheism in the first episode also serves no purpose. I have heard that Russel T. Davis is gay and watching this almost feels like him saying ""I am gay and an athiest and am going to work that in wherever I can."" Mr. Davis did a wonderful job of reviving Doctor Who, but I think Torchwood should have undergone a few more rewrites. The show is entertaining, but would be a lot better if I didn't feel like I was constantly being slapped in the face with Russel T's personal messages. If you are a big Dr. Who fan I would not automatically recommend this. Check it out before you buy it.",1237766400,4,1063,4.373737373737374
2956811,2,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood was supposed to be the ""adult"" spin off of `Doctor Who' but apart from a few splatter of blood and gratuitous sex scenes (no nudity), it would have insulted the intelligence of a normal 10 year-old.

It seems as if the talented writer and producer Russell T Davies has taken the best ingredients from other shows and movies and combined them into Welsh's omelets.

We have a team of ""specialists"" investigating unexplained mysteries (this reminds me of Buffy, Angel, the X-Files, Fringe and even Scooby Do) Torchwood even has a black van/SUV that they travel around in. Torchwood has a charismatic leader just like CSIs. They're a top secret government agency (""We're separate from your Government, outside the police, beyond the United Nations,"" says team leader Captain Jack Harkness) and chase aliens (like the ""Men in Black"" - they even have a way of wiping people's memories).

The Torchwood team even has a row of prison cells identical to those in ""Silence of the Lambs"". However, probably due to the show low budget, the cells' Perspex windows are very thin and it keeps making me wonder why the dangerous aliens in the end cell couldn't escape from their flimsy cells. The Torchwood team also has a pet pterodactyl nesting in the roof yet the place isn't littered with pterodactyl wastes or whose job it is to clean it up. The Torchwood team also let pterodactyl out to fly around Cardiff where for some miraculous reasons the thing went unnoticed by the general population.

Imagine am omelets made from the best filet mignon, a spoon of caviar, a splash of Old Spiced, a grated David Bowey CD and one of Tom Brady dirty socks, would you eat such an omelets? It's all the more depressing since this comes from the talented Russell T Davies.
I watch many Sci-fi shows from Doctor Who to the new Battlestar Galactica and Fringe and the different between those shows and Torchwood is that the scripts from other shows work hard to create a plausible reality unlike Torchwood.

Accept for the character Captain Jack, the rest of the Torchwood team themselves is made up of stupid, ignorant, arrogant, selfish, unprofessional dolts who readily sacrifice the lives of innocent people and other team members for their own benefit. Gwen, the ex-policewoman new recruit and one of the main characters of the show have a dopey lived in boyfriend who does something boring. She professed to love him and promptly shag one of her male co-worker. Yet when the stupid boyfriend learns of his girlfriend betrayal, he quickly forgives her and continued to live with her.

In ""Doctor Who"", Captain Jack was the charismatic, flirtatious, try-sexual secret agent from the future who tries to have sex with male, female, she males (I'm not sure if your pets and farm animals is safe from the Captain). Yet in Torchwood he became a one dimensional character who dated his male subordinates, mopes about the place like a lovesick schoolgirl, his whole appeal stripped away. In another of the show's many visual non-sequiturs, Captain Jack stand on the tops of very tall buildings for no good reason, like Batman, broodingly staring into the distance. The many, many impressive aerial shots of the city that pad out the episodes must have cost lots of money but did nothing to enhance the plot.

Take the plot of the second episode, for example, which was lifted entirely from one of the episode of ""Doctor Who"". Except now the villain isn't an alien, trapped inside a television, that feeds on the electrical energy of the human brain, it's an alien trapped in the body of a jailbait teenage girl who shag people to death in order to absorb their `orgasmic energy'. Torchwood duly captures her and locks her up. Gwen goes down to the cells for a chat and, affected by the alluring pheromones the alien gives off to attract its prey, ends up in some hot lesbian action. The rest of the team just watches the whole thing on CCTV unconcerned that their colleague is playing ""tongue hockey"" with an alien parasite.

Torchwood season 1 is just plain awful, hopefully, season 2 and three will be much better and Russell T. Davies will make serious improvement on the characterization instead of beating the viewers on the head with his pro-Wales, pro-alternative lifestyle agenda. Torchwood is just entertainment, not a political broadcast. Keep it that way, Russell, and your message will get further.",1237161600,5,4394,4.857142857142857

In seven disc you get quit a bit.  All 13 episodes of the show unedited as you might have seen on the BBC America Channel as I did.  Now, most of what was cut out is development of character and plots, sorry they didn't really cut out additional sex folks, but I thought most of it was useful.

Many of the disc contain what are called ""deleted"" scenes and these vary from what appear to be last minute cuts to first level editing where the full sound and music is missing.  What I would have really liked (part of the one star reduction in rating) is for these deleted scenes to have been available closer to the actually episode they were cut from.  It would have been very cool to have the option to add them back in and watch the show.

The sound was odd with a lot of softness in the introductions on most of the episodes but this sound problem did not continue in the episode itself.  Nothing new as far as I could tell in terms of sound.

Probably just as many hours spent on these ""featurettes"" about filming and the actors if you are interested in that sort of thing.  Personally I'd prefer these things removed and the price dropped about $10 or so myself.  This is damned expensive for what in America would be a half season of shows.

There are a few TW offices and this one happens to be in Cardiff, where Captain Jack says there is a rift in time and ""things"" from ""out there"" keep popping up in Cardiff.

There is Captain Jack Harkness a guy from the future and the past, Ianto Jones the ""gopher"" coffee/tea maker but he will become much more then that in due time, Owen the doctor and resident ladies man, Toshiko the computer wiz.

Epi. 3: Ghost Machine- Gwen gets hold of an alien object that gives you visions of past crimes. 4*

Epi. 6: Countrycide- TW team goes investigating in a deserted village and find themselves out of their elements. 5*
Epi. 7: Greeks Bearing Gifts- Tosh gains the ability to read minds after receiving a special gift. 4*
Epi. 8: They Keep Killing Suzie- A series of murders are linked to Torchwood, Jack and the crew turn to the one thing that might help, resurrect Suzie Costello. But was this a fluke or does Suzie have other plans?5*
Epi. 9: Random Shoes- The invisible spirit of a hit and run victim tries to convince Gwen to locate the alien that might have been responsible for his death. 4*
Epi. 10: Out of Time- A 1950's passenger plane arrives in 21st century Cardiff, can the TW team help them assimilate to modern life?5*
Epi. 11: Combat- The team discovers a ring of that are kidnapping Weevils (aliens) for there own mixed up reasons. 3*
Epi. 12: Captain Jack Harkness- The Captain and Toshiko are transported to WWII Cardiff, there Toshiko soon finds out that being Japanese at this time is not that good and they meet the real Capt. Jack. Back in the present the rest of the team have to battle there own demons in order to find a way to bring their friends back, but things are going to go horribly wrong. 5*

Sadly, I was bored to tears before I got to the second disc, and quite halfway through that one. It was just dull -- badly written, badly paced, poorly acted. In particular, the central character of Jack Harkness is played with one of the worst Brits-doing-an-American accent performances I've ever seen, a stiff, unconvincing, pale imitation of Tom Cruise-ish macho cool... Which is weird since Great Britain has no shortage of fine actors who are perfectly capable of doing spot-on Americanisms. Anyway, this series is not very good -- the sci-fi concepts, such as they are, can be seen in much more engaging versions in almost any other medium -- movies, tv, books, comics, you name it.

Captain Jack (Barrowman) is the head of Cardiff's Torchwood.  It's a secret agency that deals with keeping aliens and time rifts in check.  The show picks up when Gwen is recruited as a new Torchwood agent.

Torchwood is darker than Doctor Who and for a slightly older audience.  It does deal with some more adult aliens and has many innuendoes of adult nature, but it's all done in good fun.  As was said by show runners and critics, it does seem to follow a format each week-- Alien comes, chaos ensues, Torchwood wins.  There is some character development, but we get much more in later seasons.  The cast is amazing.  They all seem so natural and you'll find yourself becoming attached to them quickly.

I commend it for being a new kind of scifi show like there has never been done before.  It is very original.  I like dark things, but not the way this show is dark.  It has too many atheist and homosexual overtones to the point of being unrealistic.  At times you think that the main point of the show is about atheists and homosexuals.

Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is fascinating to me as a character.
I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.  His sexuality (actually it seems that for him, a non-human, human categories of sexual preference are silly and irrelevant) never seems to be an issue.  He can seduce anyone.",1232668800,2,703,4.395348837209302
2956826,3,B000VWE5OY,"My children and I recently discovered the new Doctor Who programs and we were impressed by the intelligent scripts, the superior direction and sometimes outstanding acting.  This prompted me to order the anagram series Torchwood, billed as ""a grownup sci-fi.""  Doctor Who lead writer Russell T Davies conceived Torchwood and wrote the initial episode, which seemed to be very promising.

Alas, the reality fails to deliver on the promise.  The scripts don't provide us with a ""way in"" to the central characters and thus we never really come to care about them and their travails.  The challenges they face - aliens and other oddities crossing a temporal rift to invade Cardiff - are too simplistic and monotonic.  Some of the scripts struggle for relevance (for example, Meat, in which ordinary people are not for the last time the villains) but the single-episode story format is too confining.  Although Torchwood is supposed to be for adults, the scripts are actually much less intelligent than those for Doctor Who.  It's a shame, because the actors here are probably capable of much more, if only they had better material to work with.  Torchwood seems to be striving to be a less banal version of the X-Files but in the end doesn't rise to anything more than forgettable filler.

Several reviewers have commented on the sexual aspects of the series but in reality there's very little sexuality on display, and that which is shown is just kissing and loving gazes.  Americans may get worked up over the same-sex stuff but let's face it: any for-adults European show is going to contain material that US citizens will find disturbing.  There's a huge cultural gap between Europeans and Americans and Torchwood reflects that, but it's not really integral to the show, any more than are the ringtones on their mobile (cellular) phones or the fact that despite all the high-tech stuff they don't seem to be able to get frame-mounted tactical lights and laser target acquisition devices for their handguns.

In short, this is a series that could use a serious make-over in the scripting department, with a lot more emphasis on plot and character development.  If Doctor Who can assume that its audience of children is capable of following clues and subtle hints and can handle emotion to a considerable degree, why on earth would Torchwood miss out on precisely the things that made its parent series so compelling?  Davies clearly needs to return to the concept and beef it up, or the BBC should do the decent thing and opt for euthanasia.",1232236800,3,2540,4.901869158878505

Torchwood captivated me from the beginning, and I was looking forward every night to watching an episode. I liked the characters, though I did find them a bit shallow, unintelligent, stubborn, prone to mistakes, and unwilling to learn from their mistakes. In the real world, such mistakes would lead to criminal prosecution, and in the very least, an immediate discharge. For example, one character (I won't spoil it for you by giving his name) disobeys orders and opens a rift in time that puts the whole planet in danger. No big deal, he is forgiven! A little far fetched, don't you think?

What really put me off is finding out that the lead character, and hero of the series, Jack, is a homosexual.  OK, we live in a world where this is acceptable, but why show intimate kissing (with open mouth and tongue) between the same sexes? Are the writers trying to tell us that this is completely acceptable? Is this series about space aliens or sexual morality? Won't children be watching this series?

I would have easily given this series a five star rating, but because of the sexuality, I give it a three star rating, and I definitely do not recommend it to children!",1231718400,2,1259,4.561946902654867

But this is rubbish.  Everything about it is disappointing: the writing, characterisation, continuity, acting, directing, editing, music, sound editing, lighting, and special effects. Perhaps the producers were too ambitious for their budget, or perhaps they felt they could rely on the cheap-and-cheerful plastic rocks and rubber monsters that populate early Star Trek and most of the Dr Who series and not bother with essentials like writers.

Everything is wrong with this series, so I shall only discuss the writing.

The characters are inconsistent, irresponsible, shallow, immature and stupid.  Their dialogue is often stilted and inane; there were only a few moments in the entire series when a line stood out as being at all insightful or witty.

The relationships between the characters are also shallow and unappealing, and the focus is, as many reviewers here have stated, mostly crude sexual opportunism.  I have nothing against depicting sexual relationships on tv, but the immediate rush of first kisses is not the interesting part. But that's all we get in Torchwood; the writers don't bother to explore the relationships in depth, to develop compatibility or explore the consequences of infidelity and rejection, or bother to maintain a credible emotional arc.

The stories are just a loop of plot devices, emotional wallowing, long harangues declaimed most theatrically, and silent movie era over-acting.",1231718400,37,1551,5.380165289256198

While the cinematography and general sci-fi feel are OK, the characters (other than Caption Jack) are absolutely miserable.  I kept hoping that they would all be killed by the end, but alas I knew I would be disappointed since they are in Season Two.  Even Captian Jack was only a shade of his brilliance in Doctor Who.

I can't believe that Russell T. Davies could be associated with this.  My opinion of his writing has just taken a heavy hit.  I will certainly not be buying Season Two nor watching it for free if I can watch The Doctor in a re-run.",1231545600,3,736,4.244604316546763

Slightly disappointed at the opener, it was not until the 2nd or 3rd episode where I really started to appreciate, then love the characters and premise despite their naivte at times. After all, they ARE NOT the Doctor, they are humans who for the most part have had little to no exposure to aliens and their technology, and are basically winging it (well, despite Jack) with 21st Century know how- They don't have all the answers like the Doctor, but they carry on their mission to learn more and adapt.

It is a reflection of how the earth carries on WITHOUT the Doctor's presence and the learning curve associated with trying to deal with extra terrestrial incursions- really, did Mulder and Scully ever get this much exposure or effect when dealing with aliens? Seems like every time they got close to a close encounter, the plot did not allow for prolonged or even physical contact with their protagonists, and they were usually relegated to staring at the thing as it disappeared.

The interpretations that the characters are morally compromised, well, I am sure that everyone of us is so perfect that we can judge other's character.

A great series and only getting better, with competent acting, great stories, and the FX is on par with Dr Who (Suprise?).",1227139200,3,1414,4.712550607287449

""Torchwood: outside the government, beyond the police. Tracking down alien life on Earth, arming the human race against the future. The twenty-first century is when everything changes. And you've got to be ready."" - Jack Harkness

If you're looking for just a Doctor Who spin-off, try the Sarah Jane Adventures, but if you're looking for something a little darker, more drama, and a lot more interpersonal characters, then Torchwood is for you.

It revolves around Torchwood 3, based in Cardiff, which is set on a Rift in Time and Space. The job of Torchwood is to monitor this rift and seek out any aliens coming through before they get out into the general public.

Torchwood is run by Captain Jack Harkness, who many Doctor Who fans will remember fondly. Gwen Cooper is your lead into the world of Torchwood, and you learn about how it all works along with her. The story line between the characters are are deep and very complex. Love traingles, squares and pentagon's abound.

Now, a word of warning...there are homosexual relationships in this show. Could be because Jack, being from the future and an alien, doesn't see male or female, he just see's life form.

Yes, there is sex in the series and 95 percent of it is heterosexual.  I've gulped a couple of times at how graphic they sometimes make it, but I figure I'm just not use to it.  The homosexual sex is pretty much limited to intense ""snogging"" (kissing.)  There is no ""gay adgenda"" in the show, just diverse people doing their diverse thing.  BTW, I'm a 54 y.o., heterosexual, American woman who selfishly wishes John Barrowman was straight and a little older; he's gorgeous and, from what I've seen on the DVDs and his website, is as sweet as he can be.

The stories appear to be just written around an excuse to get the characters into compromising positions.

2956843,5,B000VWE5OY,"I have to refrain from saying Torchwood is light years ahead of Doctor Who - partly because it probably isn't but mainly because it's too different to even compare the two.  Where Doctor Who (at least at its best) keeps you on the edge of your seat from the excitement, Torchwood keeps you rivited to your TV from the intensity.  Yes, Torchwood is far more ""adult"" oriented; and far less alien ""monster"" oriented.  But to me the main difference is the level of intensity.  And this intensity proceeds not just from the nature of the relationships between the characters - who are definitely not the typical one-dimensional sci-fi characters - but from the uncertainly of each episode's resolution.  I've watched all of Season 1 and a few of Season 2, and, so far,  each episode has had an unexpected turn of events at the ending.  This show, unlike Doctor Who, does not have ""happy endings.""  You always know, with Doctor Who, that  all will be made right again with the world; not so with Torchwood.  Yes, the alien entity is effectively dealt with; but there's no sense of relief.  All is not right with the world again. The resolution leaves as much loss as gain in its wake - if not more so. This was no more true than with the 2-part Season 1 finale.  Part 1 was absolutely magnificent, in every respect - as great a show as I've ever seen; Part 2, though, was a great let-down - because when the alien entity finally made its appearance, it was entirely anti-climactic, and the resolution unsatisfactory in that it wasn't really worthy of what went before it.  The loss was far greater than the gain.  It's unusual enough to see any Sci-Fi show which doesn't have a happy ending that restores everything to the way it was before anything happened; but to see one that never has a happy ending is nothing short of amazing - particularly amazing because we're conditioned to believe that saving the world from the ""bad guy"" is such a good thing that it makes everything  alright again.  But everything's not alright just because the world's been saved.  What's lost is lost and gone forever.  Kind of like in the real world.",1220918400,5,2128,4.599469496021221

Torchwood reminds me alot of the comic, ""Batman and the Outsiders"" - about a team of flawed super-heroes who spend more time fighting their own personal demons than super-villians. The protagonists in Torchwood don't have any super powers (except for Capt. Jack Harkness who can't die) but they all have alot of emotional baggage and relationship issues. Throw in some Doctor Who atmosphere and the result is a real winner.

Torchwood is funny, deep, heartfelt and sexually provocative; sometimes all at the same time. A truly remarkable achievement. The best part: there will never be a lame American TV version of the show, due to the sexual exploits of the characters in the show.

The show is successful because of the exploration of each character. It delves deeply into their psyches fleshing out their strengths, flaws and intentions.

Every episode seems longer than it actually is because of the sheer AMOUNT of story the writers and actors are able to pack into each segment. The characters are real, beleivable, and sympathetic. Captain Jack Harkness, played by stage and TV actor John Barrowman, is charismatic, cryptic, mysterious, and absolutely ruthless is carrying out the mission at hand, wether it's capturing a ""weevil"", romancing a coworker, or executing a member of the Torchwood team who's become corrupted by alien technology.

This series has several Dr. Who tie-ins, from the introduction of Jack Harkness in Season 1, to Jack joining the Doctor and Martha in Season 3 of Doctor Who, which on Jacks timeline occurs at the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2 on Torchwood. There are also multiple episodes and references to Torchwood (albeit Torchwood London, which is not connected to Torchwood Cardiff, due to a breakaway alluded to by Jack but never fully explained, at least not yet) throughout Seasons 2 and 3 of DW.

The budget for this show must be generous, as illustrated by detailed alien makeup effects, and by the Hub (Torchwood headquarters, concealed beneath the Millenium Center in Cardiff, Wales). Numerous locations in and around Cardiff are featured as part of the action, including generous slices of ordinary life for the people of Cardiff, who have no idea where their city lies on a grand cosmic scale, and what lies concealed beneath their feet.

Torchwood gives us characters with depth and humanity, that battle against the odds on an almost daily basis, while being quite obviously vulnerable and fallible, as we also often see the elements of their personal lives play out amidst the ""challenges"" posed by the many and varied alien threats.  Torchwood is also not without its commentaries on our society today, in that sometimes the ""threat"" is not alien, but humans that are so twisted and evil that they are in actuality quite in-human (and thus filling the role expected of ""hostile aliens"").  Yes, we cannot help but reminisce about certain episodes of the X-Files, if we are also familiar with that series.

Russell T. Davies, who also brought us the latest incarnation of Doctor Who, has done an awesome job of bringing us a darker trek into the sci-fi genre, making excellent use of his talent for creative plots, character development, great special effects (on a budget), and much more!  He also provides us with a perspective that can be quite thought-provoking, as we consider the world of today (here on Earth), and the possibilities that the future may hold for human-kind.  If there is intelligent life ""out there"", will we really be ready for our contacts with it, when it finally does happen???

Don't expect Jack to be the Jack of Doctor Who with the Ninth Doctor and Rose; he's still the same, but more secretive and what he learned from the Doctor reflects a lot in Torchwood.

Except that the DVDs are amazing, lots of extras, bloopers, deleted scene, comment during episodes, English SUBTITLES (thank god! I'm still not used to the Welsh accent) and more...",1210464000,2,1186,4.401826484018265

The concept is great, most of the story ideas also were (well, not all), but there are lots of shortcomings. The acting is at times downright bad (especially the actor playing Owen), the plots are about as full of holes as Swiss cheese, and most action scenes look downright silly. Still, the series has its moments, and the slow, more reflective episodes really shine; the highlight certainly being ""Captain Jack Harkness"". I just hope that season 2 picks up where this season leaves off. I will, despite my misgivings, be back to watch it.",1209772800,2,621,4.7592592592592595

2956868,5,B000VWE5OY,"'Torchwood' is a quirky British SciFi series about a special unit that tracks down otherworldly events and aliens. For the most part it's character driven and frequently dark but there are lovely moments of humor to balance the pathos. The characters are worth caring about as their personalities evolve over time from cold individualists to a supportive team of specialists. Unlike most British programs that cross the big pond, the characters have easily understandable accents and the occasional references to politics and cultural differences do not detract from the plot lines. The actors are accomplished and likable and the scripts are well written and engrossing.",1209254400,2,671,5.4

The entire team is interesting, and it's the interplay between the team members that makes the show.  Torchwood series 1 is interesting and sets things up.  The last couple of disks in the set are the best.  Torchwood series 2 is even better, but you need to watch series 1 to understand series 2.

It's not as one-note as the X-files which I loved the first two years and then got sick of it. Torchwood has great special effects, a lot of humor and pizazz.  Some of the plots are far-fetched and it's a bit hard to understand the Welsh accent on a first view, but it's great fun.  And of course Capt. Jack is gorgeous which helps a lot.

2956871,4,B000VWE5OY,"""Torchwood,"" a spin-off of the revived ""Doctor Who"" series, is a strange bird.  It can be one of the greatest shows around and then tank miserably.  The show centers around the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff operation, headed up by the dashingly handsome (and quite possibly immortal) Captain Jack Harkness (played with excellent flair by John Barrowman).  He leads a small ragtag group of scientists, specialists, etc. who set out to protect the world from bizarre aliens and other creatures that make their way to our home planet via a rift in time and space.  Some of the visitors are good, but the bad ones get the attention.  The team includes Tosh (Naoko Mori), a shy computer specialist who longs for Owen (Burn Gorman), the cocky and not-all-too-likeable team doctor.  Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) is the quiet and always reliable clean-up man who is basically a butler in the same vein as Batman's Alfred (although much younger).  The team is rounded out by Suzie and eventual team newbie, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), who adds heart to the team.

Fans of the new ""Doctor Who"" will recognize Captain Jack.  He's still the dashing and cocky hero that the Doctor and Rose met, but throughout the season his character becomes more mysterious and, at times, morbidly dark and heartless.  He is the glue that holds this show together.

What ""Who"" fans might not recognize is the heavy adult tone of ""Torchwood.""  The language, violence and sexual content go way beyond family-friendly.  This helps and hinders the show at the same time.  The language is about as bad as a PG-13 movie for the most part, but a few scenes get (necessarily) R-rated.  The violence is also essential for the most part, but the action can be too much for younger viewers.  I felt like much of the sexual content was thrown in just because it could be.  I have no problem with this sort of content but I do believe it should be used only when it adds to the story.  In ""Day One,"" a sex-crazed alien that survives off of orgasms (yes, I said orgasms), makes for an interesting and hilarious story.  While some may not like seeing homosexual content, the episode ""Captain Jack Harkness"" uses just that develop the character of Harkness even more.  In other episodes, there are brief encounters that really needn't be there.

The series has some excellent episodes, such as ""Small Worlds,"" a downright creepy thriller involving the activity of fairies in our world.  Another bright spot is ""Random Shoes,"" told from the viewpoint of a dead man following the Torchwood team as they investigate his death.  It's funny, interesting and even touching at times.  The top of the heap as far as series one goes, though, is ""Countrycide.""  The team visits a rural town where the body count skyrockets in cycles.  Who or what is killling off these people?  The answer will shock you.

Of course, for all that is great about this series, there are a few clunkers that almost turned me off to the show entirely.  First was ""Cyberwoman,"" which showcases a relationship of my favorite Torchwood member, Ianto.  He's keeping his semi-Cyber girlfriend hidden in the bowels of Torchwood hoping to find help for her.  The Cybermen are my favorite classic ""Who"" villains, but even I have to say that Ianto's Cyber-girlfriend was too hokey to digest.  The ending almost saves the episode, but it's the biggest downfall of the series so far.  Secondly is ""Combat,"" which features a very interesting fight club that is used to develop Owen's character a bit more.  Unfortunately, it all falls flat in the end.  Also, a couple of episodes, ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" and ""Out of Time,"" are mediocre at best.

The DVD release is very good, with excellent extras including ""Torchwood Declassified"" and extensive looks into each character and special effects.

So, you take the good with the bad and you end up with a new series that has wonderful highs and horrible lows.  I would recommend this series as a purchase since there are more pros than cons, but do not let your chidren watch this until they are much older.  I understand that many ""Who"" fans were completely turned off by the series' abrasive ways, but it's okay with me.  Remember, this isn't ""Doctor Who,"" it's a whole new animal.",1207526400,19,4238,4.7997237569060776

Brilliant acting, writing, special FX, brilliant everything! If you enjoy the new episodes of Dr. Who, you will  probably like this show. This show ties into its spin off show (Dr. Who) but it does not require the viewer to have watched Dr. Who at all although there are references to Torchwood in Dr. Who and visa versa.

It's just great. I highly recommend this. There isn't an actor who could play Captain Jack any better than John Barrowman. He's not only sexy, he is an incredible actor. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman are also amazing as is the entire cast including guest actors. My favorite character, Owen played by Burn Gorman, adds a great depth to the series that is not seen in too many modern television shows.

This is the type of series that you cannot tear yourself away from because the story lines just suck you right into the action. The first scene of episode one will get you hooked. A mechanical glove that can bring you back to life for a minute, come on now! It's brilliant!!!!! The last DVD has all of the commentary from each episode which gives you some chance to meet the actors, the creator of the show (Russell T.

Torchwood is a slick, smart, more adult show. The flawless casting enhances every excellent script with emotion and reality (even in the face of the unreal) getting the viewer involved with each individual story and more especially the lives and interactions of the Torchwood members. The characters grow with each episode and their chemistry pops off the screen.

I recommend this show even to people who claim they don't like sci-fi because this show is so much more. It's simply amazing entertainment.

For those of you who aren't up on the current season of Torchwood (season 2) just let me say OMG! This show just keeps getting better.",1206662400,3,779,4.720588235294118
2956877,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood comes from the creators of the recent Doctor Who revival (and writer / creator of the UK's Queer As Folk). Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who, for those that are interested.

Like most new shows, this first season takes a little time to find it's feet, to get you caring about the characters and feeling 'in-tune' with what it's all about. However, as first seasons go, the team have done a great job. John Barrowman smoulders his way through each episode looking fantastic but much screen time is devoted to the supporting cast members and it certainly is not a 'one-man' show.

Yes, the show deals with aliens, monsters and general threats to humankind (both real and perceived) as you would expect, however what keeps it interesting is that the worst aspects are generally related to more human emotions. Some episodes are quite dark, dealing with the worst of human frailties; jealousy, guilt, anger and obsession all wrapped up in a sexy, flirting undercurrent of repressed (and unrepressed) desire.

John Barrowman is outstanding and breaks the mould for the handsome hero/protagonist in every way possible - from his unashamed open multi-sexuality, through a 007-like callousness, to a softer caring side. Yet still he leaves tyou with an air of mystery and detachment to allow for some slow reveals as the season progresses.

This is an adult show and definitely not for the kids. It is really targeting those who have grown up with Doctor Who but want something more dangerous and sexy from their shows. Not unexpectedly some previously taboo areas are covered; lesbianism, gay and bisexual behaviour, but all dealt with in a measured and humourous way.

Two of the best episodes - ""They keep killing Suzie"" and ""Captain Jack Harkness"" really showcase the cast's talents and the real potential of this show. I'm looking forward to Season 2 to see if they can keep up the momentum.",1206403200,4,1911,4.922360248447205
2956878,1,B000VWE5OY,"I went into this series begging to love it.  I have been a fan of Doctor Who for over 20 years and love the new version.  I absolutely loved Captain Jack in the Doctor Who series, so I was so excited when Torchwood was released.

Then came episode 1.  I thought it was a joke.  Then, I just thought it would get better.  Then I assumed something was wrong with me.  However, I then watched the show with other Doctor Who fans.

I fast came to the conclusion that this is the worst show I have ever seen.  Period.  Any genre.  At all.

This is painful to say, but it is absolutely horrendous.  Terrible characters. [...]

In ever single episode, all the characters completely ignore Jack and do the exact opposite of what he says.  Then, guess what?  Chaos ensues.  You would think after the first 20 times Gwen screwed up, she would listen.  However, she's an idiot.  So are the rest.  I was hoping to god Jack would show some of his stuff eventually.  NO.  He's god awful too.

I honestly have pain writing this.  But listen to a fan.  Of Doctor Who, and all series Scifi.  My favorite show is BSG.  I love Firefly.  I enjoy Stargate (both series).  I can recommend Babylon 5, Farscape and Red Dwarf.  I hope to all scifi gods that this show does not see season 2.

The characters are so terrible and unbelieveable.  They act as though they are ridiculously stupid.  How can a black ops outfit have 5 people!!!  And 5 amazingly stupid people at that!!!",1205798400,32,1453,4.3584905660377355

2956880,3,B000VWE5OY,"I love the old and new Dr. Who and the last two seasons of the new Dr. Who are outstanding.  So I bought the Torchwood Series 1 without having seen any of the episodes on TV, just from my love of sci-fi and the carryforward of Captain Jack.  Torchwood's writing is no where near as good as David Tennant's new Dr. Who series.  The sci-fi in Torchwood sometimes takes a back seat to the character drama.  The last couple episodes of season 1 devolved into soap opera. I watched the whole series with my 14-year old daughter.  During these last episodes, we started doing chores while watching, that's how uninteresting they were. And, worst of all, we started (correctly) predicting what was going to happen next. As a sci-fi lover, it's still got some interesting stuff.  But too often, the characters' actions aren't believable.  This is some government funded super-shop, and yet, Captain Jack's employees very frequently act like untrained idiots. Over and Over. And them acting like idiots will take up 20 minutes at a time. Overall, if you love sci-fi excitement, I would recommend David Tennant as Dr. Who as a much better show.  If you like standard sit-com drama, then you may be more appreciative of Torchwood. Oh, and, yes, Torchwood is more ""adult-oriented"" than Dr. Who.  But they've said that from the beginning.  Sometimes, the ""adult"" stuff works well with a storyline, like when Captain Jack meets his namesake. Othertimes, though, it's more like filler to get the ratings up (sleaze) or it's filler to use up time (instead of good writing).  I really hope that the next season has better storylines, because there's great potential.  I'd start off with killing off all but one of his employees, and the one I'd keep is the 2nd-tier doorkeeper.

The ""Torchwood"" Organization seeks to eliminate any alien threat to the earth/ human life and to master alien technology to be used in future battles, if necessary. But You won't find the team battling some hidden alien agenda every week, as in the final seasons of The X-files.

You are more likely to see them deal with various problems: rifts in time, demons, the ""human monster"", oversexed time travelers, aliens that destroy you through an orgasmic release of energy, etc. The show is clever, arousing, hilarious, and very astonishing at times. It manages to brings the human characteristic back into sci-fi.

2956885,5,B000VWE5OY,"If ""The X-Files"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Queer as Folk"" had a lovechild then it would be ""Torchwood""!

The show is about the Cardiff operation of Torchwood, called Torchwood-3 lead by enigmatic, flamboyant and openly bisexual Captain Jack Harkness played brilliantly by John Barrowman. His small team of experts and him monitor the space-time rift that goes through Cardiff whcih leads to all sorts of encounters with aliens, space time disruptions, dark fairies etc.

Torchwood is written with an adult audience in mind, which means that the camp is toned down quite a bit compared to some episodes of ""Doctor Who"" and the stories are neither for prudish people nor for the faint of heart (""Countrycyde"" is a real horror movie in a one hour format) The production is high-end and features the same wonderful score that Doctor Who has since Murray Gold is also in charge here.

Regarding the first series: Don't expect a perfect first series. There are very, very few series that can actually claim of having had a perfect first season and I can think of only ""Battlestar Galactica"". It is very clear that Torchwood is still trying to find its footing and that leads to a few duds now and then (especially ""Cyberwoman"") but overall the first series already has quite a few wonderful episodes to offer (""Small Worlds"", ""Countrycyde"" ""Captain Jack Harrtigan"" etc) . The real reason to forgive the duds is the wonderful cast and the fulfilled promise that it will get MUCH better in series two.

Here he tends all too often to bark his lines and yell a lot. It seems that later in the season Barrowman finds his way again and gets Jack back on track. Of the supporting characters, there are problems as well, including too much rebellion and conflict among the team - they are, after all, people we're supposed to like and want to invite into our homes on TV or DVD, but all too often they aren't.

I watched two episodes and the beginning of the third when I realized I wasn't enjoying it. About mid way through the first episode, I was wondering when the episode would be over.

I'm not sure what the writers are trying to do here. All the characters are smug and egotistical to the point where I do not care about their characters. What's more, they have this awesome responsibility of protecting the earth with alien technology and they themselves are irresponsible by abusing the technology in the first episode. Even Captain Jack, who was a fun character in Dr. Who, is too full of himself for my taste - and for me to keep watching.

The show itself seems a little cheap on scripts and themes. Not a lot of thought seemed to go into the title music either.

2956895,4,B000VWE5OY,"If you're in the mood for some sexy science-fiction, look no further. ""Torchwood"" is one of the most imaginative series in recent memory and deserves much more exposure than it has received here in the United States.

Captain Jack Harkness is the head of a paranormal investigations group called Torchwood. Based in Cardiff, Wales, Torchwood acts outside the law and is beyond the jurisdiction of the police. Serving as mankind's line of defense against the paranormal -- be it ghosts, aliens, or technology run amok -- they've got their hands full when Cardiff policewoman Gwen Cooper discovers the group resurrecting a dead man in order to question him about his (otherworldly) killer.

Eventually joining the group, Cooper slowly comes to realize that being a part of such a secretive agency has its drawbacks -- especially the fact that she has to hide her job from her boyfriend, Rhys.

Joining her are Toshiko Sato, a computer expert, as well as fellow agent Owen Harper and ""support man"" Ianto Jones. They're an interesting and rather complicated bunch, each bringing their own personal demons to the table.

Part of the brilliance of ""Torchwood"" is that we the audience care as much about the characters as we do the plights they face. Considering they face everything from killer fairies, country-dwelling cannibals and even rips in the fabric of time that threaten to destroy the world, that's really saying something!

Of course, one couldn't review ""Torchwood"" without mentioning its charismatic lead, John Barrowman. Truly an actor's actor, he delivers fine performances as Jack Harkness, blending the perfect mix of bravado and vulnerability, making him more than just an action-hero or a dashing  prime-time star.

While some of the episodes are of the ""monster-of-the-week"" variety (one of the series' few weaknesses) we begin to build some continuity towards the end. There are too many standout episodes to name -- an uncommon trait in most American television. Sexy, scary and often quite riveting,  I'm at my wits end now that season two has begun and I *do not* receive BBC America.

Needless to say, the BBC has outdone themselves in terms of quality. Presented in the 1.85 aspect ratio and enhanced for wide-screen displays, the picture quality is excellent. Audio is equally as good, and there are so many extras that are you'll be playing these discs long after you finish watching all twelve episodes.

So for those of you haven't seen this show, what are you waiting for? ""Torchwood"" is one of the finest series since ""The X-Files"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Highly recommended!",1203552000,4,2609,5.0606060606060606

Gwen needs to get that gap between her teeth fixed.  I know I gave this a 5 star and yet I am ripping the characters.  Well what can I say.  I love SciFi and I love Dr. Who and I love Torchwood.  However, the show needs to pick up more and the characters need to get some chemistry.  It may be the highest rated SciFi on the BBC but I believe it is becuaseit was from the Dr. Who name.
Also, the women need to be hotter and though Jack is Gay (yes Gay) not Bi because if he was he would be going after women as much as men and so far that has not happened.  So everyone just shut up.

2956904,3,B000VWE5OY,"Certainly not a ""my bad"" for the series, but for the manufacture and design of this DVD set. As some others have noted, there are a few problems. One of my main interests in buying the set was to listen to the commentaries. But I was puzzled when I selected ""Setup"" from the Main Menu screen and saw that the Commentaries button was highlighted as ""ON."" ""Why wasn't it set to 'OFF'?"" I asked myself. When I started playing the episode, there was no commentary. I switched the settings from ""ON"" to ""OFF"" and back to ""ON"" a couple of times. It wasn't until I did the counter-intuitive thing that I found them. You actually need to select the ON/OFF box so that the word ""OFF"" is highlighted. It looks like you've turned the commentaries off, but you haven't. Turning them ""OFF"" actually turns them ""ON."" Go figure. But, hey, it's Torchwood. Maybe the DVD packaging gurus got caught in a time rift. ""So much flotsam and jetsam.""

The series ain't that, though -- ""flotsam and jetsam."" It's dark, quirky, in-your-face, filled with wonderful Welsh accents and, okay, lots of face sucking of all kinds. Contrary to another reviewer, I find most of the characters to be *full* of heart (if the final ep of the season ain't about heart, I don't know what is).

So, faulty button schemes aside, I'm now heading back to my comfy chair to listen to the commentary, enjoy John Barrowman's ""God-I-love-life"" laugh and lollygag through Eve Myles' wonderful lilt.",1202601600,,1449,4.67843137254902

2956906,5,B000VWE5OY,There's something about sci-fi done right that no other genre really captures.  Torchwood has that something.  It's the ability to take very human concerns (such as Gwen's quest to maintain her own identity in new circumstances) and combine them with ideas and plots that stretch the imagination to the breaking point.  It's the things that move us set in a fantastical new reality.  Some movies and shows do it better than others.  Torchwood does it as well as it can be done.,1201478400,3,477,4.7682926829268295

2956908,3,B000VWE5OY,"I'm always mystified that people think a three or four star review is bad; it's not folks it just shows that a good show could use some improvement. ""Torchwood"" is one of those shows that has a lot of potential and could become quite exceptional. Russell T. Davies ""Dr. Who"" spin-off ""Torchwood"" is a pretty good show and could be an exceptional show if it layed off the sex and violence so much. Why? Because the show focuses entirely too much on it to its own detriment. The first series starts off well if a bit uneven. The pilot ""Every Thing Changes"" sets up the premise of the series but really would have benefited from a two hour or two episode set up since the serial killer story angle isn't developed enough. We meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)the new head of Torchwood a MI-5 like organization that deals with threats from aliens and we don't mean illegal aliens. Torchwood (which is an anagram for ""Doctor Who"") was developed BECAUSE of the good doctor and, when all of its members were turned into Cybermen, Harkness started the organization again in honor of its original primary target--the good Doctor himself. He and his crew including Owen (who looks a bit like Willem Dafoe), Tosh and Suzie deal with alien incursions that occur because of a rift in time/space located in Cardiff. When Gwen a police officer witnessesTorchwood ressurecting one of the victims of the serial killer to try and find out his identity she starts trying to find out more about the investigation, she gets drawn into their world. Gwen is later invited to join Torchwood and assist the group and becomes its conscience filled with the compassion that have become as alien to them as the creatures they hunt.

The quality of the writing veers from weak to brilliant over the course of the 13 episodes included. As mentioned the pilot episode could have been much better (it's good but underdeveloped) if it was longer allowing for the plot and characters to be better deveoped. As the series progresses it does get better with ""Countrycide"", ""They Keep Killing Suzie"", ""Random Shoes"" and ""Out of Time"" all well written. The problem is that the show will deal with a emotionally charged issue and then two characters will decide, ""oh, let's go have casual sex right now"". It's an odd shift in tone much more in keeping with a series like ""Queer as Folk"" (also created by Davies)or ""Coupling"" than, say, ""Doctor Who"". As Davies himself states in an extra just because they can show more gore and sex doesn't mean they necessarily have to ALL the time. It disrupts some of the well written narratives and seems almost like the focus of those that are NOT well written with else everything is built around it. ""Out of Time"" and ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" are both perfect examples where the sexuality is well integrated into the script and inseparable from the story itself. There are others, however, where is like those moments in ""NYPD Blue"" where it felt like it was the obligatory sex scene.

Regardless, I like this show and I think fans of ""The X-Files"" or ""Doctor Who"" (and ""Supernatural"") will as well but the writing isn't as sharp as any of those shows. In fact, it suffers from the same flaws (but to a larger degree)as the third season of ""Supernatural"".

The show looks like it came from an inferior source with the image quality good when it should be terrific. Perhaps in the switch from the normally incompatable European format to the US or during the Telecine process something unexpected happened or the source wasn't properly handled. Either way, it looks good but could look GREAT given the high definition video format it is shot in.

Audio sounds extremely good unlike ""Doctor Who"" the 5.1 mix sounds very good even when it is listened to in 2.0 (the dialogue in""Doctor Who"" tends to get lost in the mix with the music and sound effects overwhelming it--it's not as big an issue here).

The extras are terrific as with other BBC shows released by Warner. There are commentary tracks by cast and crew in for every episode of the series. We also get outtakes, a variety of featurettes on each disc on various episodes and, as with ""Doctor Who"", we get the weekly edited version of ""Torchwood: Unclassified"" that runs around two hours on the last disc.

""Torchwood"" is a good series that hasn't completely found it's way yet. Once the series begins to find a better balance between its brand of ""adult"" sex and violence (as well as language)with the science fiction, supernatural elements AND character development, ""Torchwood"" will really be something. Here's hoping season two improves on season one as the inexperience of some of the writers in working within the genre shows.",1201305600,61,4696,4.755828220858896

The characters - from Gwen to Cap'n Jack - are so unreliable and so obsessed with falling in love or bedding one another (or regretting falling in love and/or bedding one another) that the entire series would only be believable if it was set in a small town coffee shop and its characters were over-stimulated 20somethings with nothing other to do than lie (either about themselves or with their co-workers).

As for the alien threats, you have to stick around for the majority of the series until you hit an episode with a fear-inspiring foe and an emotionally-packed ride.",1200355200,14,677,4.769230769230769

And Doctor Who rocks big time.  I grew up with Doctor Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf and other British fare so it's great to see this type of show.

2956913,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a great sci-fi show for adults.

I give it 4 stars because it is a spin-off; like most spin-offs, I think it still needs a little time to find its ""place.""

**Minor spoilers may be scattered through the rest of the review.**

Some of the episodes probably make more sense if you also watch Dr. Who. But it isn't essential to have watched the Cybermen try to take over in Dr. Who in order to understand that Ianto's girlfriend barely survived when aliens tried to turn her into a robot. In fact, considering some of the poor reviews, it may be better if you did not know much about Dr. Who.

One complaint I read, if I remember correctly, complained that Captain Jack was not as light-hearted as he was in Dr. Who. But Torchwood's Jack is a much different person than the Captain Jack in the first 2 seasons of Dr. Who. Torchwood's Jack has been stuck on Earth for over 100 years... making friends, falling in love, only to watch them grow old and/or die. That's enough to make anyone cynical.

Most of the complaints posted center around the sex in the show. It is definately an adult show! I think there are times that the sex detracts from the episode, but other times it adds a subtle nuance to the scene. But, since season 1 is only 13 episodes, I have hope that this will improve.

What I find funny- Torchwood is a ""secret facility"", a ""covert operation."" Yet they have Torchwood spraypainted on the wall of their hidden base, drive around in big SUVs with Torchwood painted on the sides and the top of the vehicle, and Owen routinely orders pizza using the name Torchwood! I guess there's secret and then there's secret.

All in all, Torchwood is a great show. I would recommend it to any adult fan of science fiction.",1198800000,8,1738,4.446540880503145
2956914,1,B000VWE5OY,"First off let me say I'm a huge Scifi fan and I have all (that are available) the Doctor Who episodes on VCR or DVD. I actually cried when Tom Baker regenerated into Peter Davison. But all the characters on Torchwood need to die in the Season 2 opener and a new crew needs to take over. During the course of the first season I went from looking forward to each show to hoping one of the main characters fell into an abyss. The only one worth saving is Jack (of course he can't die anyway). The rest of them needs to go. The acting was pitiful and at some point you need to care about what happens to the characters in order to want to watch it every week. I can put up with weak plots and terrible storylines (the 1st season had both), but I have to care about the characters. Please BBC, Torchwood is a great idea but throw the current cast into a pit full of Cybermen and Daleks and start from scratch.",1198800000,26,904,4.112994350282486
2956915,2,B000VWE5OY,"I don't quite know what this show was aiming for. I think an Adult oriented show for people that liked Doctor Who and over the age of 18.
Sure, Captain Jack was there but he was not the fun rogue that he was on Doctor Who but a drull leader of a group called Torchwood. Pretty much everyone was so serious that they weren't engaging enough to hold your interest and the chemistry and writing were not there to suck you in and make it a real guilty pleasure.
The Producers idea of being an adult show seemed to be throwing a sex scene in every so often for titilation purposes. Sex is fine but only when the story really calls for it and it makes sense for other reasons that  just being there to be there.
The last three episodes of the season did improve a bit and am hoping they continue with the writing similar to these last few episodes. One can only hope they lighten up a bit.",1198454400,16,883,4.16374269005848

I love the way that they have taken the time to develop each character showing both their strengths and flaws.  The season finale actually made me tear up a little when everyone reacted to seeing Jack.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars...ONLY reason, is that it relies so heavily on Dr. Who to get the full gist of what is going on.  I found myself searching Wikipedia and fan sites trying to figure out what the deal was with the hand in the jar...and some other quirks.

The writing in the first series wasn't always consistent, and at times, the special effects were very reminiscent of 1970's Dr. Who.  The characters make Torchwood so good---and carry it brilliantly, especially when they've been given something meaty to work with.  John Barrowman is totally believable as Captain Jack.  (Can he be typecast if I've never been aware of him before?  I will have a difficult time accepting him in any other role!) I could watch Eve Myles forever.  Her performance crying while eating pizza made me laugh AND cry.  Her performance in the last episode was even better.  It took me a little longer to warm up to Burn Gorman's character, but that changed when he fell in love.  His character is still terribly flawed, but understandable.

2956923,5,B000VWE5OY,"The problem with the US and the UK is that we still have different mindsets -- from current events to physical and emotional displays.  Torchwood is one of the most daring shows I've seen to date.  The storylines show innovation and feeling; no character's gender or personal attraction is singled out because of whom they interact with, whether physical or not.  The Torchwood staff is unique team of real people who happen to have the means to protect the planet.

While it was marketed as a spin-off from the [incredible] new Doctor Who series, this first season of Torchwood has certainly proven itself on its own with original characters realistically created.  The show depicts a world in which exists newfound frivolity and homosexuality to losing new interests and old loved ones.

2956924,4,B000VWE5OY,"I discovered this show watching BBC America, and it seemed worth a try. After several enjoyable but not exactly strong episodes, I thought, this isn't so bad. Then the series started to gain momentum as the season progressed. The episode about fairies was beautifully done, and ""Out of Time,"" about a plane from 1953 landing in the present and the havoc it wreaks on people's lives, was the best of the season (haven't seen the rest of the season yet but am looking forward to it). That episode contained the pathos, heart and meaning of a good novel, not something you'll usually find on television. SPOILER ALERT: When one of the passengers desperately tries to find his son, only to find him an Alzheimer's victim in a rest home, it's devastating to watch. The character Gwen brings a humanity to what has been a chilly group, and the mystery behind who Captain Jack is adds some punch to the show. Just recently found out how Torchwood is a spin-off, essentially, of Doctor Who (even the title is an anagram of ""Doctor Who""), so I guess I'll have to start catching up on the new ""Doctors"" to get even more insight to Torchwood.

This is a good and sometimes very good show that can't really be pigeonholed. It has supernatural elements to it, but the heart of the show is its characters.

  As a side note, this is NOT for early teens. Theres, among other things, a openness about sexuality ( one episode sees Jack falling in love with the man whose name he took for a 1940s con). So I only recommend this for people who won't squick over Jack's sexuality or the sometimea randy humor you can get away with on BBC.",1194912000,7,714,4.5984251968503935
2956926,4,B000VWE5OY,"Four stars for the fact that I'm still watching. It's currently mid-way through its US run on BBC America.

I have to say I was really excited about Torchwood when I heard it was going to be shown in the US. I fell in love with the character of Captain Jack on Doctor Who and I think Russell T. Davies has done an absolutely phenomenal job in resurrecting the Doctor, so I was expecting more of the same greatness. But the first episode was quite a jolt - and not necessarily in a good way; but I haven't tuned out in the hopes the episodes would get better - and there have been a couple that I did enjoy quite a bit - ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" is a particular favorite. I really appreciated the subject matter as death and whether or not there is an afterlife is a question I ponder often. Their answer to it in this episode is more than a little chilling.

My one complaint with the series is the sex. Now, I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination and I do believe that when well placed, sex can add to and enhance the story. But some of the instances in Torchwood are truly cringe-worthy and actually detract from the story. Take ""Cyberwoman"" for example. Who is gonna sit there and make out when you're being hunted by a killing machine? There are other instances throughout the series that have left me scratching my head, wondering, ""what was the point of that?""

That's my major beef with it; however, I haven't turned off the telly yet and I have seen some improvement as the series progresses. And to be quite honest, there's a zinger at the end of Doctor Who: Series Three that will probably compel me to tune into Torchwood: Series Two.

It has very interesting and unique storylines, awesome graphics and special effects (especially nice to watch in High Definition), and all of the characters are great! The ONLY bad thing, in my opinion, is that there are so few episodes per season. Don't intend to watch it with your family though because it is not for kids, but for adults who want to see an awesome sci-fi show that's a little on the dark side with a some sexiness mixed in, and a few funny scenes here and there, I definitely recommend watching/buying Torchwood.",1194220800,9,816,4.446666666666666

Davies created the series as an opportunity to do more than just family fare, part CSI, part X-files and the remaining part is out there on its own.  In Dr. Who there have been hidden references to the ""secret"" organization TORCHWOOD (the name which is an anagram of DOCTOR WHO) since season one (an answer given by the ANNE DROID in BAD WOLF episode 12 ), then appearing more physically throughout season two, even featuring the origin of the organization created by  Queen Victorian herself to defend the Earth from alien threats, including The Doctor.  The series takes place over a hundred years later as Jack says on the promos, ""In the 21st century, everything changes."" Captain Jack Harkness (played BRILLIANTLY by the dashing John Barrowman, best known to Americans as the singing Nazi lead in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number in the Producers musical) is a character introduced during season one of Dr. Who, an ex-time agent, con-man, the Doctor & Rose meet in the 1940's and turn towards the path of good and righteousness, well almost.

Jack is originally from the 51st century, which is intended to explain his oversexed ways (i.e. he is very liberal in who he ""SNOGS""& ""SHAGS"" ) His background is really complex, even before he meets the Doctor, but he is missing some of his memories from his time as a time-agent, during the ""Parting of the Ways"" the first season finale of Dr. Who his character becomes even more interesting, but I won't say more without spoiler warnings.

I know I've referenced Dr. Who, a lot, but WATCHING DR. WHO IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ENJOYING TORCHWOOD, MERELY A BONUS. There is a level to Torchwood that is directed at DW fans, but it isn't obtrusive.  The initial season of Torchwood begins introducing the viewer to its world through the eyes of Gwen, a low-rung Cardiff lady cop, eventually becomes part of a jaded almost amoral group that uses scavenged alien-tech to protect the world from future threats. The neophyte member eventually serves as catalysis to re-humanize the team. But the dynamic of the characters is one of abrasiveness, deceit, love and lust. The major players are far from perfect, by the end of the season, most of the team have done things both unexpected and at times alarming.
Most of the performances are great to watch, much Americanized, gritty acting. Gwen, played by Eve Myles, who oddly enough played a Victorian servant girl named Gwyneth who opens the closes the very rift Torchwood is build on in Dr. Who season 1. Gwen is an earthy attractive but not unrealistically so, as are most of the players, except Jack, of course, who is over-the-top silver-screen good looking, which is perfect for his over-the-top fearless-leader-with-a-mysterious-past archetype.

Torchwood is very stylish, lots of aerial shots of building in Cardiff, the Welsh city where the series is filmed and most of the action takes place.  Its waterside features remind me of New Orleans.  Another anchor location of the show in Cardiff is soooo appropriately the Roald Dahl Plaza (Carciff-born creator of Willy Wonka) it would naturally hold a time-space rift and the headquarters of a secret organization under the fountain where it can monitor extra-terrestrial traffic through the rift. Kind of a sexed up Men in Black, except no one wears black,  well ok Iantos does, but he's more of a case manager type. The series music co-composed by Dr. Who's Murray Gold is both edgy and original. As is the special effects and make-up. In the pilot episode, the make-up on the Weevil, a reoccurring species, is so good that a long scene is shot in full-light with Gwen and another character studying the creature. That is how confident and bold the makers of Torchwood are! The series won a BEST DRAMA SERIES BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts), besting Doctor Who season 2 in the category and  first episodes gave BBC 3 its highest ratings ever.  One series flaw is that Torchwood is meant to be very covert, but they also seem to be high profile ""special ops,"" other than that amusing conflict, I love the series and think that many Americans who may have never watched any British TV before, will be hooked!

The episode guide that follows may have some MINOR SPOILERS, okay?

#1 ""Everything Changes""

 This is a good one, I give it 9 out of 10,  it is one of the best series pilots I've seen. Unlike some series openers, it seems familiar with characters and where they are going, there's no early season one awkwardness here,  INFACT, Eve Myles WON a ""BEST-ACTRESS"" BAFTA (Wales) for this one, John Barrowman got a nom...

Episode Synopsis:

South Wales coffee makin' cop Gwen Cooper is at the scene of a murder when Torchwood shows,  Gwen snoops on the group and sees in a disturbing scene in which the victim is temporally resurrected, then  questioned. She starts her own investigation to learn more, and ends up meeting an alien and literally going underground unsuccessfully disguised as a pizza-girl, joins up and then things get weird....

#2 Day One

This one is less good, but is all about the fact that Torchwood is an adult series and begins to set some boundaries. Even so, this one has a great pre-titles scene with Gwen & her boyfriend, and a great opening line...7 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

The title says it all...it is Gwen's first day on the job, and because of her obligatory noob screw up she unwittingly unleashes a hot-sex-addicted-alien....no REALLY...this  one is about AN ALIEN WHO SHAGS HER WAY THROUGH THE EPISODE...it seems like a Captain Jack natural. There are some great moments and some great lude dialogue, like following the discovery of the alien's nature and the disintegrated remains of its first partner, Harkness remarks that the guy ""came and went, at the same time."" More lines like that and hot-girl-on-alien action...

#3 Ghost Machine

This one is spooky and provides some insights into the gruff team member Owen's character.  Usually, so far, Owen, played by Burn Gorman, isn't the sort to get involved or outwardly show his real feelings, in the series thus far, he has deflected them and given Gwen and the others attitude to cover.  This time, due to his unique interaction with the machine, he is very open and driven.... 8 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

The team retrieve an alien artifact that shows ghost images of the past, thus allowing Owen to witnesses a girl's murder some forty years before. He becomes obsessed with bring the murderer to justice, while Gwen tries to stop future projections from occurring as well.

#4 Cyberwoman

This one may be too much for the Dr. Who fans, but you need not know the back-story to appreciate the story, but it helps to forgive the nature of the story that seems awkward when compared to the rest of the season. The Cybermen, humans converted from a parallel Earth, were all meant to be destroyed at another Torchwood base on this Earth, this is the exception. This time a half converted erotic-cyborg with more gruesome conversion effects and other creepiness, oh and Cyberwoman vs. the pterodactyl...did I mention they have a pterodactyl in the Torchwood HQ...7.5 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

Ianto, played by Gareth David-Lloyd who is sort of the teams Alfred the Butler, managing the Batcave,  has hidden what's left of his girlfriend  at Torchwood. His plans to get outside help end with the entire team at risk of finding themselves converted or worse!

#5 Small Worlds

This one is creepy, if a little predictable, take something inherently cute and friendly, like say fairies, and make them dangerous, powerful and a little homicidal, throw in a spooky little girl, an old girl friend of Jack's er... Dad...and you have a winning mix,  8.5 out of 10 for this one....

Episode Synopsis:

Jack's senior friend has discovered fairies in a nearby wood, while Torchwood uncovers a mysterious jail death and weird weather bursts. Jack sees a pattern connected to his mysterious past....
#6 Countrycide
This one is grisly, edgy and very frightening, playing-out like a mainstream horror movie, a good one!  This one isn't for the squeamish.  ...9 out of 10 for Countrycide...

Episode Synopsis:

Deaths in the middle of nowhere split up the team, Gwen and Owen find themselves in another tight situation, a survivor hides from the killer, Tech-chick Tosh and Ianto race against the clock, and the team fight to stay off the menu.

#7 Greeks Bearing Gifts

This one isn't the best of the season, but it does give more development to Tosh's character...6.5 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Tosh gets a strange pendant from a strange woman and she gains the strange ability to read  minds. In the process learning way more than just casual thoughts, in order to make things right Tosh must get this woman into Torchwood H.Q.

#8 They keep killing Suzie

This is a great one...disturbing and well written, a fallen Torchwood member returns providing a unique opportunity to deal with the consequences of events in the pilot episode. A great exploration of Gwen and her place in Torchwood... I give it 9.5 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

The ""Resurrection-Gauntlet"" was classified as too dangerous to continue experimenting with, but a link to pre-pilot events, force the team to use the gauntlet on a deceased Torchwood member. The process goes wrong  and events go from bad to worse

#9 Random Shoes

Another surprisingly good story, most of the regular team is sideline for much of this one as it's point of view is from a deceased peripheral character, like Dr. Who's B team stories (used for shooting two shows simultaneously ), it brilliantly features an outsider's view of the team, more outside than even Gwen's episode one intro...9 out of 10...the end is a bit sappy...

Episode Synopsis:

Eugene Jones learns that he has been the victim of a hit-and-run and is dead. He retracing his ""steps""  leading up to his death, including his interaction with the Torchwood team and what he believed was an alien artifact,  while Gwen is the unwitting partner in the same investigation.

#10 Out of Time

This one is a weak one, ""the fish out of water/ romance that can never be,""  great pre-title opening with the Team on hand as a temporally -displaced plane touches down on an airstrip, mostly-predictable and unnecessarily sappy...7 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Three stangers from the early 50's are trapped in present-day Cardiff, after flying from the Rift. Torchwood helps each of the them deal with making a new life, one way or another and Owen gets serious with one.

#11 Combat

This one is written by Noel Clarke a.k.a Mickey Smith, really.  You've asked for it, you got it! The Weevil Fight Club!  This one is pretty good, what it lacks in originality it makes up for in style and intensity...9 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Weevils continue to come from the rift surfacing across Cardiff, but where are they disappearing to? Owen goes undercover to find out.

#12 Captain Jack Harkness

Warning this one is not for the homophobic; Jack is particularly randy in this one. There's loads of drama and amazing acting in this one,  although a visually limited view of the WWII era, the character of Bilis Manger, mysterious time-walker, is fascinating to watch as he manipulates the staff in this episode and the next, played by Murray Melvin (who could play William Hartnell if they every need him). .. 9.5 out of 10

Episode Synopsis:

Jack and Tosh are transported to the 1940s, during the Blitz where they meet another Captain Jack Harkness and it isn't Jack. The rest of the team go in search of decades old clues Jack and Tosh may have left.
( Watch for the ""Vote Saxon"" posters in this one. A Dr. Who series 3 ref.)

#13 End of Days

Tightly following the events in the last episode, all hell breaks loose, literally as the mysterious Mr. Bilis plans for the Rift continue with it wide enough to release the deity he worships. This one has its roots in H.P. Lovecraft's work, ...10 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

People from thoughout history come through the rift into the present across the world.  Jack learns he is the only thing standing between the world and the ""Son the Beast"". Jack is put in a position where he may have to sacrifice it all to save everyone. (This one connects directly to the final 3 episodes of Dr. Who season 3.)

2956930,5,B000VWE5OY,"Some SPOILERS here.

TORCHWOOD, a spinoff of DOCTOR WHO, is yet another television show with nifty science-fiction and paranormal elements, and it IS a marvelous and fun show. The premise: the Torchwood Institute is a covert organization given the responsibility of being Great Britain's watchdog against all things malicious and extraterrestrial. This series revolves around the amazing exploits of Torchwood Three, a branch of the Torchwood Institute which operates out of Cardiff, Wales.

In the debut episode ""Everything Changes,"" Policewoman Constable Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) witnesses a deceased stab victim's temporary return to life. This becomes her introduction to a hidden world of frightening monsters, incomprehensible alien technologies, and extreme paranoia. She meets the very charming Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a man displaced in time and leader of Torchwood Three. Oh, and he can't die. He obligingly places Gwen in the loop: ""We don't just catch aliens. We scavenge the stuff they leave behind, find ways of using it, arming the human race against the future."" Fairly soon, after some fairly interesting - not to mention, harrowing - moments, Gwen finds herself recruited as the group's police liaison. And with a spacetime rift located in Wales, she and the other Torchwood members remain up to their necks in weirdness and peril. On a more personal scale, Gwen struggles to maintain a normal relationship with her lived-in boyfriend. It's not easy being Scully.

I happened to stumble onto this dark, moody series on the On Demand's BBC America channel and became speedily hooked. It's done by the Brits and they bring their sensibilities to the table. Its tone, while somewhat reminiscent of the X-FILES, also does remind me a bit of DOCTOR WHO, but that one's to be expected as these two shows are closely linked. In fact, the word ""Torchwood"" is an anagram of Doctor Who and was a security code used by the crew of that series to foil television piracy.

The sci-fi elements naturally loom large. The show immediately immerses the audience in its peculiar and scary universe lurking just behind the veil of normality. Cool and wondrous gadgets and concepts abound: perception filters, invisible lifts, ghost machines, time rifts, resurrection gloves - you know, screwy science-run-amok stuff. The show's contents do tend to stray toward more adult themes, and the casual use of earthy language underscores this. As a reflection of this maturity, the show isn't shy in depicting several of the team members as leaning towards an alternative lifestyle. Captain Jack Harkness himself is bisexual and disarmingly casual about it. In the sexually-charged ""Day One"" the baddie is a snog-happy (wonderful word, ""snog"") space creature who snuffs out its victims at the moment of orgasm (As Jack off-handedly comments regarding one casualty: ""He just...came and went.""). So, no, not for the young 'uns, this show.

There are 13 episodes in the first series, and they are thoughtful and lushly plotted and just as splashy as their American counterparts. The CG is certainly there. The mostly British actors are very good. Gwen Cooper is played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, and Gwen makes for an engaging and ideal point-of-view character. The popular Captain Jack Harkness, last seen in the DOCTOR WHO series, comfortably crosses over into this show and drags actor John Barrowman with him. Barrowman, by the way, is magnetic! The cast of characters is interesting and complex and develops as the series progresses, with team members keeping their share of dark and dangerous secrets. One of them even turns traitor, dies, and comes back from the dead. Needless to say, the group dynamics tend to be volatile.

One negative is that most of the episodes are self-contained, which introduces a certain faltering in overall cohesion and continuity. However, the episodes will still suck you in. The best ones, in my opinion, are ""They Keep Killing Susie"" (Former Torchwood member Susie Costello returns), ""Out of Time"" (great and melancholy episode with three aircraft passengers from 1953 disembarking in the present and forced to acclimate to this brave new world), ""Captain Jack Harkness"" (very good time travel story as Jack and Toshiko journey temporaly to 1941 and meet the real Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity Torchwood's Jack would soon steal), and the exciting season finale ""End of Days"" (Wales' time rift becomes unstable and begins causing disturbing temporal anomalies).

Hmm, the Doctor Who universe seems to be rapidly expanding. First, this riveting Torchwood offshoot and now followed by THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES (longtime Doctor Who-philes will recall investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a popular companion to the 3rd and 4th Doctor). As a fan, I say keep it coming. To the curious out there who somehow haven't yet turned on to a good thing: c'mon, get hip to TORCHWOOD.",1191110400,171,4928,5.206809583858764
3189674,5,B000VWE5OY,"Having seen this program from the first BBc showing, it is the finist the Beeb has yet done.  NOT FOR CHILDREN the language is very street, and some words are being changed for the US TV release.  13 episodes leave you wanting more, and the drama that starts with the return of a group of air passangers from the 1950's is unbelevable.  Having seen teh end of the trird season of the New Dr. Who, now we knnow more about Captain Jack and his background. With lluck this will help others understand this person leading Torchwood better. CSI + X-FILES just don't do it justice. As stated above this show is not for children, The BBC has stated Dr. Who can have Torchwood on it, but due to the adult nature of Torchwood, the Doctor will not be allowed on it.  The Dr is for families, this is not. The Sci-Fi is very hard-core, in more ways than one, and if your looking for a friendly new spin-off of Dr. Who try ""The Adventures of Sarah Jane"", which should be on DVD soon, it just finished in the UK.

3189682,2,B000VWE5OY,"I have mixed feelings.  I've watched 11 episodes and feel I probably have to abandon this series, which is sad because the stories are interesting and the cast of characters engaging. To say this is an 'adult' program is an understatement. It's so 'adult' that it leaves me feeling dirty, morally conflicted and a range of other emotions from sadness to anger over some of what is espoused. For example, on a recent episode, 3 people fall through a rift in time from the 1950's.  One of the characters, a middle aged man, falls into despair because he can not get back to his loved ones.  Understandable.  Where it takes a pretty sick turn, is that this character discovers his son, is now an old man, in a nursing home facility with advanced dementia.  The son had no children and therefore there is no one to care for him.  The father, who was still plenty young enough to have cared for his son all the remaining days of his life, ensuring he is loved and protected, instead decides to commit suicide. The main character, Jack Harkness, helps and supports this and that is touted as showing care and compassion.  Somehow this is portrayed as a loving act, to help this man escape that responsibility and duty of care to his son?  Where was the concern for the son and what in practicality amounts to abandonment by the father? This episode was an affront to all parents of the mentally disabled and the mentally disabled themselves. I am a parent of a mentally disabled adult.  It would be a DREAM (in a weird way), not a nightmare, were we able, at the end of our children's lives,  to shave 50 years off our age and be young enough and strong enough to care for our children to their last day.  Our greatest fear is that we will pass and leave our children, here alone, with no-one to love them and protect them. What an act of weakness and cowardice that this show presented as an act of mercy from Jack Harkness?  A TRUE, admirable act on Jack's part would have been if he looked that man in the eye and said ""Yes, this all sucks, but grow a pair, step up to the bar and go take care of your son!!!""  This is but one of the moral standards this show promotes that is egregious.  The language is not just profanity but sexually shocking at times.  A couple of sexual scenes almost rise to the equivalent to soft porn; uncalled for.  So the bottomline for me is that although this series COULD have been outstanding, the constant moral offenses make it one that I can not recommend.  Note to the writers.

None of these characters seem to learn from their past experiences, and all of these people regularly wave guns around willy nilly. Jack is the only decent character with depth but even his character feels shallow at times.

Finally, I'm no prude, I don't mind sex scenes or same sex relationships in media, but Torchwood builds up a female protagonist as a heroine and role model for women, has her commit adultery, rationalizes it with excuses, and has her boyfriend forgive her after she confesses, then makes him forget the whole thing via an amnesia pill.

3189703,5,B000VWE5OY,"This spinoff from ""Doctor Who"" is much darker, more violent and sexier than the prior series. ""Doctor Who"" shows mostly the lighter side of contact with aliens (although some storylines are pretty dark/intense), while ""Torchwood"" shows pretty much only the dark side.

It's also full of  -- as one of the special features is titled -- sex, violence, bllod and gore.  Be warned, the sex is of all varieties -- straight, gay, sex with aliens and more.

It was established in ""Doctor Who"" that Captain Jack Harkness ""swings both ways"" but it's shown here in much greater detail.  I like it!",1486857600,,587,4.772277227722772

I loved it so much I bought the entire series box set on DVD when it came out.  I am currently watching season 1 on Prime because it's so much easier than digging out the DVDs and trying to remember which episode I'm on - Prime just automatically knows where I left off.  Captain Jack is very charming - a character that was first introduced on Dr. Who.  If you're a fan of Dr. Who, you should like Torchwood, too.  Love the Welsh accents of Gwen and Ianto, too.  It's sci-fi  mixed with drama, sometimes very heartbreaking.",1475020800,,648,4.297520661157025

3189949,3,B000VWE5OY,"Imaginative, often witty and iconoclastic and occasionally imbued with a good dose of cruelty and amorality, Torchwood offers a flavor that American TV is incapable or unwilling to emulate. The serious negatives for me: with the exception of the newest member of the Torchwood crew and its immortal captain, there is practically no character development or growth. Consequently, the series as a whole seems a bit two-dimensional: one could watch the episodes with no concern about the order of viewing them. Worst of all, despite the introduction of new props and gimmicks in each episode, their underlying structure is always the same. After having watched 6 very similar episodes, I'm ready to quit.",1470528000,,701,5.212389380530974

3189955,5,B000VWE5OY,"I just discovered this show via Amazon Prime.  It's that combination of cheesy/cool sci fi that's carried by its characters and keeps you watching even though some of the storylines are terribly contrived.  It's fun and has an unusual setting (Cardiff, Wales) that adds to the show's visual appeal.  It's a spinoff of Doctor Who, which I never watched, so I can't make a comparison on that score, but it does stand on its own.  It's sort of an ""X-Files"" with alien tech and a mysterious backstory.

3190000,2,B000VWE5OY,"I'm a big fan of Doctor Who, so I thought I'd give Torchwood a try. I finished watching season 1 last night. It's pretty bad. The characters are flat, and the storylines range from ""well, I kind of liked that episode"" to just plain terrible. Definitely nothing that made me sit up and think ""wow, this is a GREAT show"" unlike some of the stories on Doctor Who. Captain Jack doesn't even feel like the same character as he did on Who.

There ARE also quite a few sexual encounters, and it seems like the intent is to make everyone feel bisexual (except maybe Owen) with no real plot reason. They also seem to like to show Rhys naked for some reason.  I've heard that it gets better and season 1 feels like a whole other show so I'm going to give the rest of it a try (plus, there's only 4 seasons and it's fairly short). Here's hoping the addition of James Marsters (even if only for a few episodes) helps make season 2 better.",1468454400,,926,4.255681818181818

Should it be more ""X-Files"", with dramatic or soap opera-ish. You can't be all things and with only an hour to try and go ""movie-style"" character building gets lost with the ""immensity of alien domination"" theory.

It can be uneven in character development and sometimes the details and references are unfathomable to the non-British viewer.

3190080,5,B000VWE5OY,"As a fan of both Dr. Who and The X-Files, I cannot get enough of Torchwood. The show follows one of the most memorable characters from Season 1 of Dr. Who in his own blend of the Dr. Who imagination and a more grounded, adult look into the Earth that inhabits the Dr. Who universe. The exploration and adventures that Captain Jack Harkness and the rest of his small crew at Torchwood make for a really unique and engaging experience. The added adult nature of the show makes it a bit more mature and relatable for older viewers and fans of Dr. Who. One of my favorite things about Torchwood is the constant references to the events that took place in the main Dr. Who series. These little details reward you for paying attention to both shows and drawing connections between them. Now, that is not to say that you need to see Dr. Who in order to enjoy Torchwood, because Torchwood is great entirely on its own, but it definitely has tie-ins with the major series. I have to admit, I might recommend Torchwood over Dr. Who to people who want to see some quality British sci-fi and aren't quite ready to suspend their disbelief and watch Dr. Who. Perhaps if you found the main Dr. Who series to be over the top, check out Torchwood for a more grounded and relatable glimpse into the Dr. Who universe and you might find that you've become a fan of all things Who just like I have.",1465776000,5,1377,4.3828125

3190212,5,B000VWE5OY,"A spin off worthy of being in the Dr. Who franchise universe. The fist season starts out a little slow and I think they should have tied in more of the episodes with each other as they started to do more at the end. I like a show where there is a story arc that goes throughout the season. That concept is teased a lithe here but seems like it was written and filmed assuming the worst - that it would be a one season and done show. I am biased as I am a fan but in short I would recommend giving it a try even if you know nothing about Dr. Who or the backstory, it might even be better that way. Great entry point into someone wanting to get into Who but not sure where to start. Current and future Dr. Who show runners take turns at Torchwood episodes so it gives one an idea on how a Dr. Who episode would go.",1463616000,,812,3.897590361445783

With Gwen unwittingly stumbling upon a device testing, that could help her solve the mystery of a dead man. Amongst the mystery, there's the alien devices, pills that make you forget the past 24 hours, and a magic lift (wish I had one, not to mention the pills and one of the devices...).

I found myself wondering why they bothered to follow him. Then, and this going into the second season, Jack's character development seems to be unfocussed. He had a touching love for a woman in his past, and he seemed most human at that time. The later divulging of the original Jack whose name he took, seemed a peculiar an unexpected twist, and the entrance of a past partner in the second season was annoying. Tosh's character seems rather weak and doesn't seem to hold her own in this team. You would think this team would need to be a tighter working group. The young man who seems relegated to clean-up and the geek of the group is such a sidelined undeveloped character that I cannot remember his name. I felt that the writers started off with a great idea, but didn't know where to go with Jack and his immortality, so threw unexpected plot twists in that pulled the series down.",1463184000,3,1054,4.611702127659575

The aforementioned episodes are just skank and gore.  The mind-reading episode misrepresents the Welsh when their thoughts are exposed as being so shallow and disgusting.  Which leads me to believe the writers must hate people, and their product confirmed it.  ""So there's no decent script, budget or expectation of acting ability?  Just throw in two men kissing, nobody will know the difference.""  Owen reminds you of a very non-discriminating daycare with too many kids without shots, which would make Jack the equivalent of a male prison shower floor.  Lots of skipping ahead this season.  But something behind the scenes happened at the second season, they got new writers in or something.

3190375,1,B000VWE5OY,"The writers of this show consider Torchwood the grown-up version of Doctor Who. So, let me get this straight. Grown up means swearing a lot, acting stupid and immature, and sleeping around indiscriminately. Is that what we are brainwashing people to believe? Doctor Who is far superior than this show for adults. Having watched John Barrowman on Doctor Who, I had such high expectations for this show. In Torchwood, he is serious, pathetic, and an emotional wreck. It's difficult to feel sorry for him or anyone on the show. Except for the episodes that were written by women, there was too much graphic violence, especially Countrycide and Cyberwoman. Also too much graphic sex and too many same-sex scenes. I'm no homophobe but give me a break. Is everyone on this show is either bisexual, gay, or confused? Hard to tell and I don't care anymore. They act like they are in a college fraternity but are suppose to be running this important organization. Not believable. It's not just the same-sex scenes. All the sex scenes are drawn out to an embarrassing level. If I wanted porn, I'd watch porn. This show is also very dark and depressing. No wonder society is messed up. Shows like this give you nightmares and you with a bad feeling and sad. There's enough sadness in the world. The show also seems to be anti-Christian. In Out of Time, Jack tells a guy who wants to commit suicide that there is nothing after death. Everything goes black. Then he helps him commit suicide. Nice. An episode that had promise but turned depressing. No happy endings here. No thank you. I'll stick with Doctor Who.",1461715200,,1600,4.738351254480286
3190376,3,B000VWE5OY,"Crazy premise but the characters are interesting enough although, having watched only two shows three stars might be a bit premature.",1461715200,,133,5.380952380952381

3190389,5,B000VWE5OY,"I am watching Torchwood for the second time and enjoying it even more. The best part of the story is its depth of vision and experience. this isn't a comic book translated to screen with two-dimensional characters ever involved in defeating an enemy. We learn about each character, the good and the bad parts of them, that supports the action. Treat yourself to a really fine series.",1461715200,,383,4.731343283582089

3190437,2,B000VWE5OY,"While the potential of this series is high, it utterly fails to satisfy.  Plots end without satisfying conclusion.  Few characters are likable.  Too much time wasted on childish melodramatic subplots.  There is no consistency, such as, gratuitous flings in one episode then unconvincing serious love from the same character in the next episode.  The science fiction elements sometimes show promise, but most are silly, and therefore, the serious plots when they do arise feel awkward and out of place.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell what the series finds more important, good stories or gay relationships.",1460678400,,609,5.291666666666667

3190441,1,B000VWE5OY,"This is a tedious and boring little series, typical of the British who refuse to waste money on things like quality writers, good actors, and realistic side effects.  This is like a bad spin off of Dr. Who with the same disjointed attempt to make ordinary things appear fantastic and bizarre.  The props are something you would expect in a high school play and for that matter so is the acting.  To top it off, this series blasts you with some loud dissonant music at the opening and closing of each series.

God Awful is being too kind to this series.  It even lacks the obligatory hot blond that such bad productions usually rely upon.  Instead we get a short plump gal with a huge gap in her front teeth.  She is slightly cute but she lacks acting skills and sex appeal, which means there is not much there to keep the watchers interest.

In one world we see like live Doctor Who, but in another world, brave and immortal Captain Jack Harkness is fighting against aliens. Torchwood is not sentimentality. This is drama series where every character is individual. The staff of Torchwood aces of their profession. I have the feeling that they can do everything and they're not afraid of anything. But they, like every person, has its weaknesses. And often this is contrary to the Charter of Torchwood. In general, I want to say that the first season was a success and I want to express special thanks to John Barrowman and Eve Myles for their amazing contribution to the creation of this series.",1426896000,,766,4.7669172932330826

However, some turns in this series as it progresses. So I would say not for young kids viewing either. Actually, there are episodes when the cast has male relation ships with other males and females kissing as well. If this bothers you then I would suggest to be prepared. Its not until the last few episodes that it takes a turn. I started the second season had to switch to Netflix because Amazon started to charge for it and it is free there and its the same kind of thing. It has a good story about a team that hunt aliens so it is science fiction I did enjoy that part and especially the free first season. But, if you decide you like it. You can either pay Amazon 1.99 per episode or switch over to another streaming. station.",1424390400,,871,4.253012048192771

3190459,1,B000VWE5OY,"They took Torchwood and Doctor Who off of Prime. I think its fair to rate Amazon's service with this product. The HD quality seems to go up and down depending on connection or how you size the window. I've seen Torchwood look excellent to very bad. The Silverlight plugin works most of the time but its not as fast as Netflix. Sometimes the window is playing sound but video goes blank and I must pause and play. The shows don't move onto the next video in your watch list or the next episode. Amazon cut this program out in the middle of the month and it pissed me off. Torchwood was the only thing I've watched this year. I can't watch the show with a membership anymore, so 1-star.

As for the show, its mostly great. The characters begin to come into their own halfway in the season. I really like the actors, the music, and the way it was filmed. Of course its not perfect, but I think its more entertaining than the usual scifi show.",1424044800,5,939,4.305084745762712

Thanks to John Barrowman being on Arrow I started to search out videos online of his convention appearances, came across many that were Torchwood cast / him talking about the show, so I decided to watch a couple of his Who episodes, LOVED them, had to see Torchwood... By the middle of season 1 (streaming on Prime) I ordered the entire series on Blu-ray (first ever blu-rays ordered)

The show is very well written, it is smart, it is cheaky, it has a wonderful cast and great characters. It is somewhat built on the Dr. Who mythology, but it stands on its own feet. You don't have to know the Who world/episodes to be able to enjoy this show on its own - but they are well worth watching (Christopher Eccleston and David Tenant seasons at least).
I find myself watching the episodes over and over, on the computer or on Blu-ray, over and over. They don't get old, the jokes stay funny, always enjoyable.",1418169600,,1017,4.380952380952381

Episodes

1~ ""Everything Changes""
The story is told from the perspective of Gwen Cooper, who comes across the Torchwood team through her job as a police officer with the South Wales Police, who are investigating a series of strange deaths. Through Gwen's discovery of Torchwood, the audience are introduced to team members Owen Harper, Toshiko Sato and Ianto Jones. Suzie Costello, as played by Indira Varma, had also been billed as a series regular prior to transmission, though in a twist the character was revealed as the murderer and killed off at the end of the episode, with Gwen replacing her as a member of the Torchwood team.

2~ ""Day One""
The episode centres on Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) working her first case with Torchwood Three in Cardiff. A purple alien gas is loose in the city and takes Carys Fletcher (Sara Lloyd Gregory) host; the gas kills its victims by orgasm, leaving behind a pile of dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her. In the end they track her down to a fertility clinic; the gas leaves Carys to take Gwen host, but is stopped by a portable prison cell and dies out.

3~ ""Ghost Machine""
When Gwen retrieves an alien object from a fleeing man in a hoodie, she's haunted by a vision of a lonely young boy. As the team tracks down the object's owner, Owen experiences an even more terrifying vision and a long-buried crime resurfaces.

4~""Cyberwoman""
In this episode, Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) is revealed to secretly house his girlfriend, Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), a half-converted Cyberman, in the basement of the Torchwood Hub. Ianto wants to turn her into a human again, but by doing so her Cyberman influence takes control, and the rest of the team must stop her before she could become a threat to Earth. However, Ianto still believes she can be saved.

5~""Small Worlds""
Jack encounters monsters from his past: fairies, with the ability to choke people and change the weather, make a series of killings centred around a little girl, the Chosen One. He also reunites with an old friend, but will Estelle Cole be safe when she starts to get a little too close to these fairies? And how can Torchwood stop a force from the dawn of time, masters of Earth, their domain? More importantly, what is so crucial about a little girl named Jasmine, for whom these creatures will gladly tear the world apart?

6~""Countrycide""
Concerned that the space-time rift is spreading, Torchwood investigates a series of gruesome deaths located in a small village in the Brecon Beacons. What sort of creature could cause such shocking injuries? Stranded without communications or equipment and isolated from one another, the team confronts a terrifying enemy.

7~""Greeks Bearing Gifts""
Tosh is given an alien pendant which lets her hear other people's thoughts. As the Torchwood team puzzle over a centuries-old skeleton, the pendant forces Tosh to question her commitment to Torchwood. Is her new-found ability a blessing or a curse?

8~""They Keep Killing Suzie""
Torchwood is linked to a series of brutal murders around the city. As Jack and the team investigate, it becomes clear somebody wants their attention. What is Pilgrim -- and how is it connected to a figure from Torchwood's past? The resurrection days are far from over. They have no choice but to bring back Suzie.

9~""Random Shoes"" A hit-and-run victim, obsessed with alien life, realises only one person can solve the mystery of his death: Gwen Cooper.

10~""Out of Time""
When a plane from the 1950s lands in modern Cardiff, courtesy of the Rift, the passengers are reoriented by the Torchwood team, who becomes drawn closely to their lives.

11~""Combat""
Still wallowing from the end of his relationship with Diane Holmes, Owen fell into depression. Likewise, Gwen Cooper had grown sick of her affair with him after this change in personality and the buildup of guilt toward cheating on Rhys Williams. It was in this episode that she called off the affair and tried to right things with her husband in a ""dress rehearsal"" speech, where she confessed to Rhys all her goings-on with Owen, only to supply him with Retcon so he would remain in the dark. Instead of being forgiven, he reacted maliciously, causing her great pain.

12~""Captain Jack Harkness""
While investigating an abandoned dance hall, Jack Harkness and Tosh find themselves having slipped through time and stuck in 1941, where the dance hall is being used for service personnel. Jack meets the real Captain Jack Harkness, the man whose identity Jack took after his death, which Jack learns will be the following day at a training exercise. Jack and Tosh recognize that they must find a way to open the Cardiff Rift from the present day in order to get back, and Tosh begins to work out ways of leaving the necessary equations to the rest of the Torchwood team. Jack manages to talk to Captain Harkness, and learns that the officer is attracted to him, though such demonstration in that setting and during those years, is socially unacceptable. The two talk more, Jack asking if the Captain would like to go elsewhere, but he refuses, acknowledging that Jack has obliquely told him that his remaining time on Earth is limited.

In the present, the rest of the team come to realize Jack and Tosh are missing in time from photographs taken during the dance, and also determine that the Rift is the only way to bring them back, though Ianto believes it to be too dangerous. As they investigate the dance hall, they meet its proprietor, Bilis Manger. Unknown to them, Bilis is also present at the dance hall at 1941 and has attempted to alter and change the messages that Tosh is leaving for the Torchwood team. After finding the Rift key that Jack placed in a clock in Bilis' office and Tosh's equations, Owen is prepared to take the chance to open the Rift. Ianto holds him at gunpoint to try to stop it, but Owen refuses, and proceeds to open the Rift. As the dance in 1941 winds down, Captain Harkness invites Jack to dance with him, shocking the other partygoers. During the dance, the Rift opens. Jack says his goodbyes to the Captain, giving him a passionate kiss before he and Tosh step through the Rift. Bilis is also pulled through the rift. In the present, they are met by Gwen and return to Torchwood, where Jack and Tosh share a toast to the late Captain Jack Harkness.

13~""End of Days""
During Gwen's (Eve Myles) morning off with her boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), they both see news reports of UFO sightings over the Taj Mahal, and an armed clash between CO19 officers and English civil war era soldiers. When she returns to the Hub, the team learns that they are caused by unstable rift activity after it was opened to rescue Tosh and Jack.[1] Torchwood has its hands full; Tosh and Owen (Burn Gorman) investigate cases of the Black Death in a local hospital, where Tosh sees a glimpse of her mother, while Jack and Gwen are alerted by PC Andy to a Roman soldier in a police custody. In that time, Gwen sees a glimpse of Bilis Manger (Murray Melvin). Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) sees Lisa (Caroline Chikezie), who tries to convince him to open the rift. During a heated argument, Jack fires Owen. While at a bar, Owen sees Diane (Louise Delamere), who tries to convince him to open the rift.

Jack and Gwen go to Bilis' clock shop, ""A Stitch In Time"", where they learn that Bilis can step between eras in time. When Jack leaves, he shows Gwen a vision where Rhys dies. Gwen rushes to Rhys and has him imprisoned in Torchwood for protection. However, Bilis causes a power cut to raise a security breach in the Hub, releases Rhys, and kills him. Gwen and Jack find Rhys' body in a pool of blood, just like in the vision, and Gwen screams in horror. Jack tells her that they cannot bring him back, but she knows the only hope of restoring him is to open the rift. All but Jack agree to this, and attempts to stop them by holding the team at gunpoint. When he insults them, they attack and kill him, scan his and the team's retinas and open the rift. After Jack revives himself, they discover that Bilis has manipulated the team to open the rift, in order to release Abaddon, a creature similar to the Beast,[2] whose shadow kills anyone who touches it. This gives Jack an idea; he cannot die, so it can feed off his life. The shadow attacks Jack, but a blue light flows out of his chest and destroys Abaddon, killing Jack, seemingly for good.

The rift is now closed. Gwen is relieved to see Rhys alive. After several days, Jack is still dead, but is brought back to life after Gwen kisses him goodbye. The team welcome him back, (Tosh gives Jack a hug, Jack hugs and kisses Ianto, Jack forgives Owen and hugs him). Later Jack announces to Gwen that the rift is now more volatile than ever. Gwen questions him: what would tempt him to open the rift to which Jack replies ""the right kind of doctor."" As the rest of the team go for a coffee run, Jack sees the Doctor's severed hand glowing. He then hears a familiar whooshing noise coming from above the Hub, and runs towards it. The rest of the team are perplexed at Jack's sudden departure, believing something has taken him.",1409356800,,9667,4.675294117647059
3190567,5,B000VWE5OY,"I couldn't get enough of this Series.  Very addictive and it keeps on enticing you to watch more!  The Brits can certainly make those 'scenes' that make one's sexuality, regardless, look normal and erotic at the same time.  The story lines could be 'quirky' but also left me wondering, ' maybe it could be possible?'.  If you like 'sci fi' with lots of juicy  scenes, you will like this.

There are lots of questions for Gwen, the former police constable and newest member of the Torchwood team, and very few get answered. (Who is Captain Jack Harkness and why won't he share the details of his past?) Maybe because she's new to everything, Gwen offers human compassion to all of the stories. The others have become hardened, or maybe numb, to most of what goes on. There are strict rules that must be followed, but usually get broken and that leads to all sorts of problems for both the team and the planet.",1408838400,,613,4.63302752293578

It seems like things are spreading out instead of coming together.  But, I don't care. It's better than any of that reality gunk.",1408579200,,412,4.63013698630137

I thought the supporting cast -- Eve Myles, Burn Gorman, Gareth David-Lloyd as the best-ever personal assistant -- were terrific.  I enjoyed the way it used the Welsh terrain. Best of all were the science fiction plots -- not always terribly originally, but always (for my money) well done and, significantly, adult in approach and theme.",1408579200,,518,5.142857142857143

I was pleasantly surprised that the main character was bi-sexual. Barrowman was my favorite actor and I enjoyed watching him flirt with Gwen.,1405468800,,445,4.493827160493828

3190611,4,B000VWE5OY,"Season One is a good introduction to the characters in Torchwood while building a backdrop of who they are and what they do. All actors bring their best in an enthusiastic performance. Rapport with the characters is built quickly. The indiividual episodes of Season One goes here and there, sometimes with almost cartoonish aliens popping in and other episodes on other chores. The entire cast is enjoyable and work well together.

One word of caution, this is NOT a series for children. There is violence, language, and a surprising amount of sexual conduct. And that irrestible twinkle in Captain Jack's eye swings both ways - he is bisexual, though his sex scenes are gay. I was surprised by this and none too pleased as were a number of others according to critics. Apparently, writers felt that a series based in Cardiff, Wales, to be interesting, needed a swinging group. They were wrong. John Barrowmen gives a charismatic performance that allows one to overlook these unnessary personal details; his character is powerful and his goal is for all things good for the world.

It's fun and heavy all at the same time with some characters you really aren't sure if you like or not, but I think that's why I kept watching. Some insanely, most likely unintentional, comical over-acting by Barrowman followed by some really good acting - his leap-ins as the 'hero' are some of the funniest moments in the show.

3190619,4,B000VWE5OY,"I debated 3 vs. 4 stars because I think I would really give it a 3.5 if I could.  The basic premise of the show is not ever really written into the storyline.  The idea that something big is going t hit in the 21st century and they are preparing for it, really?  How?  When?  None of the characters know what they are preparing for but jack, just dealing with stuff that comes up.  By the end of the season they have at least professed to be collecting alien and alien technology in preparation, but we don't really see a lot of aliens or alien tech.  It is focused on a rift in the time-space continuum in the writing, and in the shows plots.  There is no real character development in the traditional sense of writing, other then Gwen.  Some with Jack, but more in regards to that he is a mystery.

So get past that you just jump into a story full speed ahead, and that the assertion of the shows introduction doesn't really align with the writing, and you still somehow get a show that is entertaining to watch.  Given this is entertainment that isn't so bad.  The mystery to Jack in coming season makes you ask why, when revealed who cares?  People die, weird stuff goes on from catastrophic to x-files weird but show just clunks along and basically entertains episode to episode making it worth watching.  So don't worry about the overall mismatch of overall story and actual stories and it is entertaining enough and good enough to watch and enjoy and not get caught up in the many anomalies because in the end It does what I want any show to do.  Entertain me.

Can understand the lack of awards coming for any aspect, but entertaining enough that it got by for a while and kept getting funded.  So just don't look to deep and enjoy what you can.  There is far worse so enjoy what is there and ignore the warts, they're small enough to.",1404000000,,1843,4.354838709677419

The cast in this show did a fantastic job and the stories were all good. Why the welsh bbc blew it , and destroyed this show, can only be guessed at.  However the seasons you do get to see remain excellent and of course they are science fiction all the way.  The blu ray version of this is outstanding. I have a uk one and it's got good extras.

It is just sad that the show has been placed on pause because it would have been extraordinary; it would have made it 10+ seasons, but other interests prevailed.

3190640,5,B000VWE5OY,"I'm as straight As a pole, but I'm love homosexual couples and this is one of the first shows I've watched where there's both homosexual and straight couples which is honestly one of my most favorite parts about the amazing show. #JANTOFOREVER

I also love the different types of aliens and the main aliens, ""The Wevvils"" are very human-like which is great. It gives an in-site on the creativness of the human mind, that until I watched ""Doctor Who"" and ""TorchWood"", I didn't know an adult could have -Not that I would recommend you let your child watch this or any child for that matter, given their not as mature minded as me- Its great to know that adults may just be as imaginative as me.

Jack Harknas is a sexy hilarious blisexual man that's around 150 years old, and can never die (SORRY FOR THE SPOILER). He's shown as the leader of TorchWood, but also an amazing friend. He goes through many hardships and has more secrets then comprehended in season 1. He makes for one of my favorite characters.

Ianto Jones is a irresistible (in my opinion), bisexual, sarcastic, mature, and serious young man. He's known  the Tea-Boy or butler, but soon proves to be capable of much more. He is most defiantly my favorite character out of all.

Owen Harper is a charming, seemingly bi-curious (As shown in the first episode), snarky, cocky, confident, smart young man. He's the TorchWood doctor. He's also a very good fighter.

Tosh(Toshika) Sato is a young, beautiful, bisexual, technological genius. She's TorchWoods computer freak. She's also secretly in love with Owen. She's also good on missions.

Gwen Cooper is a pretty, brave, caring young women. Personally, I think she's a bitchy, to curious, slut. She's just a girl who goes on missions. She's dating Rhys Williams. She's unmistakably my least favorite character (Which sucks because it's mostly in her POV)

Here are some of my absolute favorites of season 1:

#1, ""Everything changes"":

Episode summary (In my words):
Gwen Cooper is a regular WPC who sees TorchWoods craziness on a particularly crazy murder investigation. Being a genuinely curious person, she goes on her own investigation of mysterious sexy babe Jack Harknas and the rest of the TorchWood crew. She gets into more then she bargains for when she actually meets Jack Harknas and learns the inside workings of  TorchWood headquarters.

My review:
We meet the amazing characters of this ""Doctor Who"" spinoff. Unlike alot of other shows there is no awkwardness between the characters in the first show, which is amaZing.

My favorite quotes from ""Everything Changes"":

""Love this planet. Still at least I won't get pregnant, never doing that again."" - Jack Harknas

""I walked. I bloody walked."" - WPC Andy.

""Well that lasted No .2 seconds."" Suzie.

""And he looks good in a suit."" - Jack Harknas (Because it's true)

""Careful. That's harassment, sir."" - Ianto Jones.

#2, Cyberwomen:
Episode summary (In my words):
In the basement of the TorchWood headquarters, Ianto Jones hides a horrible secret: His girlfriend, Lisa who worked for TorchWood 1.and was converted into a half-Cyberwomen.

My review:

This one really hit me in the emotional territory, because Yan (Many people's nickname for Ianto) couldn't bear to live with out Lisa. I love how in this episode he proved himself to not just be a coffee boy, but is also hste the fact that Jack aimed his gun at Ianto. AND it has Gowens (Gwen and Owen ship name) and Jantos (Ianto and Jacks ship name) first kiss.

My favorite quotes from ""Cyberwomen"":

""Gwen, this is for you, baby."" - Owen Harper

""OOH! Come to daddy!"" - Owen Harper

""Girls, get your own bags."" - Owen Harper

""Some times in order to save what we love, we have to risk losing it."" The doctor trying to fix Lisa.

""Sure, take ten seconds."" - Jack Harknas

""The human race is weak."" - Lisa

""Ianto, I need to here those beautiful Welsh vowels."" - Jack Harknas

#3, ""They keep killing Suzie"":

Episode summary (In my words):
Suzie gets resurrected, when people are murdered to get ""TorchWood""s attention. She doesn't die right away and almost kills Gwen.

My review:
Bloody awesome. Although, I wish Gwen AND Suzie would've died. No offense to Eve Myles, she's an amazing actor.

My favorite quotes:
""My team bitch about you all the time."" The police captain

""Are you always this dressed up for a murder investigation?"" -  The police captain

""Why? Would you rather me naked?"" - Jack Harknas

""If it's someone we pissed off that narrows it down to, oh, four or five million?"" - Owen Harper

""And that's just the humans."" - Jack Harknas

""Then, you better stay away from sharp objects."" - Jack Harknas

""The Riz-Miz."" - Ianto Jones

""Give Ianto a stopwatch and he's happy."" - Owen Harper

""It's the button on the top."" - Ianto Jones

""Meaning of life, does God exist, all that stuff."" - Tosh Sato

""Rules and regulations."" - Jack Harknas

""Well stash him away too."" - Jack Harknas

""That's all we are in the end. A stash of boxes."" - Tosh Sato

""All right, so we kill her again."" - Gwen Cooper

""Life knife."" - Ianto Jones

""Yeah, You frighten the s*** out of me."" - Owen Harper

""I had a boy friend who use to walk into a place like that. A grand entrance. Got kind of boring. Though he was one of twins, so I put up with it. Twin acrobats. Man, I gotta write that book. Maybe, even illustrate it. You know, I can talk for a long time. A very long time."" - Jack Harknas

""I must be mad."" - Gwen Cooper

""Nice work, Ianto."" - Jack Harknas

""Nothing. Just nothing."" - Suzie

""This is. Driving through the dark. All these stupid, tiny things. We're just animals howling in the night 'cause it's better than  silence."" - Suzie

""Lots of things you can do with a stopwatch."" - Ianto Jones

""That's the thing about gloves, sir. They come in pairs."" - Ianto Jones

That's my review. Hope it was useful! :) <3

3190658,4,B000VWE5OY,"As a fan of Dr. Who, you will often find this as a one off from Dr. Who. After much catching up on Dr. Who, I decided to give this a try.

As many others have written a reviews complete with spoilers, I will simply share a few thoughts here.

I completely enjoyed this series. There are many differences between this show and Dr. Who. There are a few similarities. Those who enjoy Dr. Who but would like a little bit more darkness in their shows will most likely enjoy this.

Why did I rate this a low five? Mainly because it is a bit more risque than I prefer. It addresses adult issues such as same sex couples, bisexual preferences etc. And really, it doesn't address them so much as it is a way of life for many of these characters. For me, the good thing was that it didn't turn this show into a political statement - it just simply was a part of this show.

Torchwood is more like one of those shows that would be shown after nine here in the U.S. when I was a kid. It has enough scenes that indicate sex is occurring or has recently occurred to be risque.  Some examples might be- Gwen walks in on the main Jack Harkness and another man and you can clearly see buttocks and male on male kissing.  There is some drug use. And even some alien cruelty, which completely bothered me- much like hearing about someone being mean to the neighbor dog. There is also swearing. While these things might not bother some/many people, it is worth noting prior to watching this series, that there will be some who find it offensive.

I loved the aliens and I loved the mysteries that they solved and the problems they solved. It is a fairly fast paced show with quite a variety of shows in each season. To be honest, I would have continued watching this show if there had been more seasons/shows to watch.

Boredom that leads to bad behavior; and bad behavior done in the name of good that turns into a new form of evil. Do we learn from our mistakes or do we keep the demons at bay?  It is necessary to consider all our actions in the name of good.

This is what Torchwood is for me. A range of characters and imaginative plots spliced into real life situations.",1395360000,,455,4.218390804597701

When I saw the pilot, I thought to myself, not promising, then they added Eve Myles, AKA Gwen Cooper to the team, and I concluded, that was the end. The Gwen character is the most annoying character I have seen in a story of it's type. She is silly and unconvincing. The Owen character is almost as bad. The rest of the cast does a good job. They finally wrote off Owen. I think it is way past time to write off Gwen. Torchwood needs a rethink, and a rewrite to make it the good SiFi show it should be. If you are going to do a spinoff, of what I consider to be one of the best SiFi shows of all time '' Dr Who ''  you have got to do better than that.",1395360000,,767,3.9483870967741934

Torchwood may be a spin off, but it is surely capable of standing alone. There are a few mentions of ""The Doctor,"" but aside from those non-spoiler mentions, this series is really standing alone. I'd say there is nothing like it on tv, at least not in America, nor that I've found on the BBC. This series has a lot of cursing, sex, blood, and some good violence. The acting is superb, and I'd make a special note to the actor portraying Owen, I'm looking forward to finding more things with him in it. He steals the show in quite a few scenes I dare say.

I don't want that or need that added to the program to make it attractive or interesting.  As a matter of fact, due to the sexual content I find watching Torchwood unpleasant.

Season 1 starts out a little slow with character development.  Jack, Ianto, Tosh, Owen and Suzie are all grouped together in Torchwood Cardiff Wales.  Exit Suzie and enter Gwen.  That's when the fun begins.

I'll not spoil anything except to say, subsequent seasons are much better.",1394582400,,452,4.868421052631579

3190740,4,B000VWE5OY,"I am torn between three and four stars for this because It isn't really a very compelling ensemble drama (not entirely realistic and the script often seems artificial and forced), while as a Dr Who spinoff it has way to much adult content to be kid (or work) friendly and while most episodes make sense in terms of the typical Dr Who sensibility - but with NSFW adult content a couple of episodes are just too grim.  The cast is constantly complaining of burnout, which would make sense in terms of the depressing episodes, but often they do so in the context of personal victories which again feels forced.

That said, the show gives you plenty of opportunity to each of the characters other than Jack go through some fairly transgressive experiences that provide some interesting acting challenges.  Too bad several of the characters are so hard to like.  As for jack, he's the main link to the Dr Who / Saturday Cartoon sensibility in that he gets to act the hero with no personal consequences.  They occasionally try to portray him as haunted, but it just doesn't work.  In the end this is a guilty pleasure in which you get to see several Welsh characters having a lot of gratuitous, but semi realistic sexual experiences in the context of an otherwise completely unrealistic fantasy situation featuring famous Welsh landmarks.

They've covered so many odd and quirky paranormal topics that I now can't wait to load the next episode to see what's next on their agenda! The Temporal Rift is one bizarre goodies chest! What's going to come out of it in seasons 2 thru 5 (psst... I already know about season 2 but I'm not telling! *smirk*) The larger principal cast on which to focus has turned out to be a real bonus. I've loved each and every character development episode. Oh, and how I do so love the Brits' more relaxed attitude about portraying sex on TV... OMG, the episodes with Jack and his wartime namesake and Owen with his lady out of time were the HOTTEST things I've seen outside of a theatre and even hotter than most of those in this (U.S.) country! [Note to England... next time you repress a group of people into leaving and forming their our country, could you please make it a group of sexual libertarians??? This bunch of Puritans you unleashed on us is no fun at all! *LOL*] But anyway... Torchwood has turned out to be a most delightful surprise. I'm enjoying every minute of it. I just wish your 12 & 13 episode seasons were more like the 22 episode seasons of Farscape.

I could have done with a little less explicit gay sex, a little less nudity period would have been nice as we have children in the house. Still, sex is not the over riding theme here, and there's a legitimate story to be told. Unfortuantely, I watched the 4th season first, and the sex increases in that season substantially.

Kids of a certain age don't mind that stuff and would enjoy the wacky science fiction plot lines. But the episodes have scenes that are either too racy or too scary for young children. Wouldn't want my kids watching it.

This show doesn't choose an audience and produce for that audience. It's confused.

Americans stereotype Brits as having bad teeth. I think the Brits are fighting back with the lead American actor whose upper teeth are so perfect they look actually really weird, like dentures or something.",1391990400,,617,5.15

3190808,3,B000VWE5OY,"Overall, I like this series, but as a spinoff from Doctor Who, I find it lacking in many respects.
The series is supposedly about countering alien technology and incursions, but only a few episodes actually introduce any alien elements.  The plots are predictable, almost completely lacking in suspense.  Doctor Who is full of likeable, engaging characters, but most of the characters in this are bland, with nothing to get the viewer vested in their experiences.
The production values, especially the cinematography and lighting, are much better than average.  The set decoration leaves a lot to be desired, with seldom more than some dark tunnels and stairs to look at.  The sound quality is full and dynamic, but the use of music to set the mood doesn't quite get the job done.
The actors do a fine job with what little they're given to work with.  The writing is seriously lacking in character development, which may be why the characters are so hard to get engaged in.
I will probably watch the entire series, in the hopes that it improves, but if it continues at the status quo, I won't be watching it twice.",1391731200,,1114,4.751295336787565

3190810,4,B000VWE5OY,"Science fiction helps my mind focus away from life's harsh realities. I like that Torchwood tends to be more grounded than Doctor Who without being so serious as to be stressful. In particular, I am impressed with the character portrayed by Eve Myles. Captain Jack comes across as a less than serious hero who is quite interesting, but less than convincing. Despite my criticisms, anyone who enjoys science fiction should like this show.",1391644800,,437,5.0

3190815,4,B000VWE5OY,"It has started very well and it grabs your attention, but the writers suddenly starts to go a bit away from the initial proposal. So, from alien lives and equipment, it went to Rift based central thing.
The character Owen is the best char in this story, but it is centralized more over Gwen (extremely dull character)",1391385600,,317,4.578947368421052
3190816,5,B000VWE5OY,"I have only gotten about half way through the first season but I am anxious to watch the remainder. I am a very devoted fan of Dr Who and I watched the Torchwood mini series Children of Earth and also Miracle Day, I loved them! Very engaging, and as most of these shows do leaving you wanting more.
I'm always anxious to watch more. Can't wait for the new Dr Who, Is there more Torchwood after Miracle Day? It sort of left it open for the possibility.",1391299200,,451,4.195402298850575
3190817,3,B000VWE5OY,"Interesting major premise--a man(?) from the future(?) seeking to prevent alien takeover of this planet. Set in Cardiff, Wales (NOT London) for a change.  2d in command is a policewoman with no training in paranormality, whom everybody tries to bed, often successfully despite being engaged.  Small band of emotionally troubled denizens of 2007 form rest of team that always solves (sic) the major crisis at the last minute through skill and luck--of course-- whilst often laying the ground for the next improbability. despite burnout, deceit, sleeping with each other in sequential pairs M/F.  A little over the top with limited BBC budget but still viewable.",1391299200,,660,5.266666666666667
3190818,3,B000VWE5OY,"The first episode was intriguing, with interesting characters, chemistry, and a well designed set. I was excited that this was going to be a new discovery...it was not the case. I couldn't even finish the soft core ridiculous 2nd ep. What happened? Disappointing.",1391299200,,263,5.1395348837209305
3190819,5,B000VWE5OY,"Interesting show. If you liked doctor who, you'll like this. This show is a little more ""grown-up"" but does make some cool DW references.",1391299200,,137,4.75
3190820,5,B000VWE5OY,Much like warehouse 13. I will watch this as long as it is on tv. Great acting and it is nice seeing England.,1391299200,,109,3.782608695652174
3190821,4,B000VWE5OY,This is a very lite SciFi show.  They are really not concerned with the science of things and are not for the Heinlein or Asimov follower.  The characters are believable and episodes deal with their day to day lives as well as aliens.  They do leave a lot of questions unanswered even to the end of the series.  For Americans the accent will get in the way of understanding what is being said. However this is an easy show and enjoyable to just relax and watch.  I would recommend it to any that do not demand total accuracy in their Science Fiction.  If you are a Dr Who fan this is the show for you.,1391299200,,601,4.182608695652174

3190825,3,B000VWE5OY,This Brit Sci Fi mystery is mildly entertaining.  It's something to keep you occupied on a rainy or snow day.,1391126400,,109,4.45

3190830,5,B000VWE5OY,"I am a Dr. Who fan, and I think that primed me very well to enjoy this series. The monsters are hokey, and the plot lines are pretty predictable, but it's the idea of non-stop adventure and fun that allows you to sit back and enjoy this as a guilty pleasure.",1391126400,,258,4.078431372549019

3190834,2,B000VWE5OY,I am NOT homophobic but it appears to me the writers of this series make a lot of effort to write into almost every script a woman kissing another woman and a man kissing another man. Most of the time it doesn't even make sense in the plotline. After watching the first season and trying to start the second season - I'm done.,1391040000,,326,4.190476190476191
3190835,4,B000VWE5OY,A cute show with some scifi and action.  It's well put together for a British show. Very entertaining.  I think anyone who likes scifi would like this show.,1390953600,,156,4.535714285714286

3190843,4,B000VWE5OY,"I knew nothing about this show before watching the first episode.  It held my interest through the first episode, the only one I had time to watch.  I'd call it sci-fi lite.  I normally don't like British shows, but I did enjoy this one.",1390867200,,237,4.340909090909091
3190844,3,B000VWE5OY,Imaginative and good storyline. I would never recommend TV that participates in the reprogramming of society to become bi-sexual or homosexual.,1390867200,,143,5.857142857142857

3190854,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is just the right combination of drama, comedy, monsters, and mystery.  The many layers of each character are peeled back gradually, forcing the watcher to challenge early assumptions.  I do enjoy watching it on Amazon (free, thanks to my Amazon Prime membership) and viewing two or three episodes at a time.  One can really get wrapped up in this series.  Overall, Torchwood is fun and spunky entertainment.",1390348800,,418,5.102941176470588

3190857,5,B000VWE5OY,"TORCHWOOD (or DOCTOR WHO in another spelling) was and is a great series. More adult than DOCTOR WHO and filmed in Wales the show was filled with everything needed to make a good watch. Captain Jack, (gorgeous!) along with the rest of the team are a great ensemble who fill the hour with everything from aliens to ghosts to time travel and always a little bit of humor thrown in. I loved this show when it first aired on BBC America and was thrilled to find it available on Amazon Prime. Although I seriously doubt I missed any episodes I will enjoy watching each and everyone again and hopefully catching one or two I missed. A great show that I recommend to everyone! Watch it and be entertained.

3190859,3,B000VWE5OY,"I like Dr. Who and the interactions with Torchwood were always good episodes but the organization seemed more competent and organized than it does in this series.

Torchwood seems more like Scooby-Doo episodes with a team of amateurs figuring out the villian of the day and killing, imprisoning or having sex with it.

A lot of adult content, not graphic, except for language but you might have to explain a lot of gay innuendo and sexual situations.",1390176000,,450,4.8311688311688314

It can also get seriously gross and have graphic violence; which is strange because the science and realism of the show is often just dumb.  Never the less I am drawn to the shows intense overacting and dramatic intensity (so far).",1390089600,,406,4.5479452054794525

3190868,4,B000VWE5OY,Good takeoff of Dr. Who. I like that it is not centered on just one character. Each person at Torchwood is given a lot of info about personality and background.,1390089600,,160,4.366666666666666

The Torchwood Institue is a ""secret"" organization (with a flashy Land Rover with sirens and lights and the authority to take over any crime scene they feel falls under their jurisdiction).  Cardiff is the convergence for a lot of weird activity and apparently has been for some time as some of the stories take you back hundreds of years.

As with any show, there will be some episodes that leave you asking ""Why?"", but overall I have been impressed with the storytelling.  Campy, strange and creepy, will all be covered in various episodes.

They also exposed the way in which our insane government thinks, that is, keep the people in the dark, they cannot handle the truth and ""alway protect your own personal interest, even at the expense of the public. I think they had a nice balance between exposing government for its faults and weaving a good story.  Capt. Jack was an interesting character.

3190893,1,B000VWE5OY,"This BBC film based in Wales is only interesting due to the geek side of the subject matter, aliens. Now everyone's sleeping with each other. It portrays promiscuity but with confusion as to they all are bi sexual. It's all a BAD weird.",1389398400,,236,4.511627906976744
3190894,4,B000VWE5OY,"Good. Show but I don't think it is appropriate for younger teens, a little more sex than I want my kids exposed to.  That being said the wife and I both enjoyed the series.",1389398400,,172,4.0588235294117645
3190895,3,B000VWE5OY,"WHEN I READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS SHOW I WAS INTRIGUED.  NOT SO MUCH AFTER THE FIRST FEW SHOWS.  I STUCK WITH IT THOUGH AND THERE WERE A COUPLE SHOWS THAT WERE VERY GOOD.  THEY FOCUSED ON THE PEOPLE AND HAD A LOT LESS VIOLENCE AND GORE.  I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL INVEST ANY MORE TIME IN THIS SERIES, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE LAST SHOW OF SEASON ONE!  IT WAS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.  ALSO I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSORY TO MAKE CAPTAIN JACK GAY!!  I KNOW IT IS COMPULSORY NOW TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE GAY CHARACTER IN EVERY SHOW ON TV BUT, REALLY?  IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE INTERESTING IF THERE WERE SOME SORT OF ROMANCE BETWEEN GWEN AND THE CAPTAIN.  UNLESS YOU LOVE SEEING LOTS OF BLOOD AND GORE FLYING AROUND, SKIP THIS ONE!",1389312000,,725,4.233576642335766

3190900,4,B000VWE5OY,"Overall, I'm hooked! It took me a few episodes to get over my Americanized/Hollywoodized television expectations. The protagonist, Gwen, has a large gap between her front teeth, and it appears there's no attempt to cover her facial freckles. At first, that was extremely distracting; now, I find it charming. (And wish Americans were as comfortable with ""imperfect"" characters.) The basic concept is okay: aliens, time travel/warp, anything paranormal being investigated by a special team. Captain Jack is an American with a mysterious past. He's intriguing. NONE of the characters are stock! Each one of them is flawed. There's no reservation with adding a little ""bad guy"" to the good guys. Sometimes it's funny; sometimes it's a bit cheesy. My American sensibilities are often tested with the open sexuality...but I get over it! I look forward to whenever I can squeeze in another episode.",1389139200,,892,5.244755244755245
3190901,4,B000VWE5OY,"I just discovered this show (in 2014) while doing a couple of art projects that require media distraction and was pleased to discover that, while some of the story lines seem a little repetitive, the BBC was presenting same-sex relationships as equal in dramatic weight and meaning to straight relationships... even in 2006.

By following one character's introduction and eventually membership in Toarchwood, the viewer learns about the Institute so often referred to in Dr. Who. The writing and some of the content are meant for adults. This is not sci fi for kids. There are references to Dr. Who as well. All in all, this series is fun to watch and more than occasionally thought provoking thanks to great script writing, good acting, and having one foot firmly in reality.",1389052800,,570,4.767676767676767

3190916,5,B000VWE5OY,It has been great entertainment watching the 1st season of Torchwood.  Wasn't until I got through the first season that my son told me this was a spin off of Dr. Who?

It's almost as if the government had appointed a committee to make this program.  Oh, that's right!..  It's the BBC!  How Top Gear ever got on the air is beyond me!  It's actually entertaining, and even Americans can understand them!  The female lead in this series has a mouth full of... crumpets, or something.  I can't understand her, and I don't think mediocre shows with a British accent are necessarily good.  Some people must think so, otherwise we wouldn't have all those Dr. Who episodes.

3190927,5,B000VWE5OY,"Is there anyone in Great Britain who cannot act as well as any American Academy Award winner?  Apparently not.  Smartly written, and brilliantly acted by the usual BBC cast of amazing flexibility.  Some one says, in casting, ""Ok, so last time you were the totally believable, toadying, pale creature in Dickens, but this time you are savvy, dangerous, glamorous, and sexy - got that?"" and away they go!  Plus, there is no accent I love so much as a Welsh one.  Bonus.

And did I mention sexy?  Well, not much else to say except this is a really smart and sexy show.  And can I really mention often enough; sexy?

Forgot to mention; this is a slyly witty show as well, with first class special effects.  But overall, and at heart, a gloriously sexy romp, as only British Prime Time telly can offer.",1388707200,,797,4.510489510489511

3190944,5,B000VWE5OY,"Edgier that Dr. Who, from which it was spun off, Torchwood uses the science fiction format to explore multiple aspects of human relationships. Although each episode could be viewed individually, it's better to watch the entire series to follow the evolving stories of the characters.  The actors deftly make their encounters with aliens, alien technology and sometimes bizarre human behavior seem entirely believable.  They are also easy to identify with in their conflicts with, and compassion for, each other.  John Barrowman is great as the decisive and enigmatic Captain Jack Harkness who can also can also betray moments of frailty and self-doubt.",1388275200,,652,5.372549019607843

3190954,4,B000VWE5OY,"Even though this has a markedly different feel (perhaps not so much as some of the more recent Doctor Who storylines), it stands well on its own.

3190957,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a story I would recommend.  It truly makes one think about what it would be like to live through the centuries.  It is a spin-off of a Dr. Who sort of show however Torchwood was more for older people, not so young; meaning those who stayed up after 9pm.

The members of the Torchwood Institute, a secret organization founded by the British Crown, fight to protect the Earth from extraterrestrial and supernatural threats.  It tells a story of not the ""original"" start of Capt Jack Harkness, but maybe it began on Dr. Who interchanges.  I have throughly enjoyed this series as it tells a story to which you cannot wait till the next episode.",1387670400,,653,4.594827586206897

3190960,2,B000VWE5OY,"I'm an avid Doctor Who fan, but I'll be honest and say I didn't do my research before starting into Torchwood.

I liked the premise and enjoyed the pilot - a bit more ""R-rated"" language and a dash of violence I was willing to accommodate for a solid storyline in a universe with which I'm already acquainted and friendly.

But ""Day One"" quickly killed my hopes with the leap into pretty gratuitous sex almost right off the bat.  I even read the brief description and chose to be (naively) optimistic, thinking that the sexuality would at least be semi-obscured in that ""something's happening, but it's mostly off-screen"" kind of way.

Nope.  It's all right there, on the sink in the ladies' room.

I'd expect that from an HBO or Cinemax sort of show, but after watching several seasons of Doctor Who, I suppose I just wasn't expecting that from BBC.  Now I know better.

That isn't to say there isn't a lot of quality stuff going on.  But I set out for something lighthearted and entertaining and not explicitly sexual.  I found that in the pilot, but in the next episode it turns out I signed up for softcore porn instead.

After reading a few more reviews that lead me to believe that this is this series's M.O., I'm disappointed to say I'm opting to go find another series to watch.",1387411200,,1285,4.51948051948052

Overall, it is an excellent production and will be enjoyed by those who favor police-type who-dunnits as well as the sci-fi crowd. However, I found the utterly unnecessary promotion of homosexuality disgusting and inappropriate for viewing by younger audiences. I am not a homophobe but on the other hand, I think it tasteless of the writers to force the audience to endure scenes of male to male fondling and French-kissing which contributed little or nothing to the plot or theme of the story. I would wager that there is a homosexual writer on the staff of the Torchwood series who enjoyed taking the opportunity of shoving his lifestyle down the throats of the audience (no pun intended).  Not recommended for adolescent audiences. Just my 2 cents.",1386201600,,816,5.08955223880597

I found the ideas ok, but there was a lot of unwhovian violence and Captain Jack, cute as he is, just was not a strong enough character in his own right to carry the show.",1385683200,,296,3.8360655737704916
3190973,1,B000VWE5OY,"Despite the fact that I absolutely adore the Dr Who franchise I tried to temper my expectations.  It is a spinoff after all and those rarely live up to their source.  However, instead of a watered down Dr Who as I was expecting I ended up with one of the most god awful television shows in recent memory.  I don't mind the swearing or the violence.  It's quite honestly never really offended me.  I enjoy a number of very graphic shows like Spartacus and Game of Thrones, but in this abomination we're introduced to one of the main protagonists as he uses an alien aphrodisiac in order to rape a woman at the bar. Granted, because of certain events he doesn't follow through with it, but it was definitely not a moral turnaround.  The rest of the crew isn't much better.  Little jealousy fits and love spats between all of them.  It's almost as if they decided to take an idea introduced in the Dr Who franchise and hand it over to a day time soap opera writer and this is the result.  I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to cheer for characters like this.  there should be some attachment to characters in shows you watch.  If a primary character perishes it should hit you, make you feel something.  There isn't a single character on this show that I would shed a tear over.",1385596800,9,1276,4.382978723404255

I can't seem to suspend my belief any longer for this series. It could have been great being a knock off from Dr. Who but the writers blew it.

3190977,5,B000VWE5OY,"After watching seven seasons of Doctor Who within 3 months, I decided to check out the Torchwood series. For the most part, Torchwood is an awesome ride that I really enjoyed. Watched it all within a month, it's probably better this way. Season 1 will probably be more enjoyable when I go through and watch it again. It took me a while to really appreciate Gwen, I didn't dislike her but it seemed like the amount of time spent on Gwen's life outweighed the other team members. As sometime who already watched Doctor Who I'm curious if viewers were supposed to catch on to exactly who's hand was in that jar Jack had back when this first aired. My only real complaint is we never find out HOW exactly Jack ended up with the hand. Moving on, Torchwood season 1 was a lot of fun to watch, there are some darker episodes, the finale was absolutely great, the box set is beautiful. I'd recommend catching a rerun on BBC America or watching it for free somehow, somewhere before committing to buying the sets.",1384473600,,1004,4.491803278688525

3190980,3,B000VWE5OY,"Season 1... I liked it and it was okay.  I'm liking season 2 much, much more because the cast seems more cohesive and the story lines aren't just about who's sleeping with who and Jack shooting people/aliens.  Season 1 was definitely a building season both for the cast and writers.  I highly suggest moving on to season 2 if you're having a hard time getting into season 1.",1384214400,,374,4.470588235294118

This is a spin off show with more of the adult type in language, sex, and ideas.  I would pre-screen before you like the little ones watch this.

The Biggest Problem I had with it is that I was watching it with my daughter and had to get up quickly to turn it off, in ""Day One"" there is a bathroom sex scene that is completely inappropreate for young children. My daughter watched every Dr Who episode and is a big fan, nothing inappropriate just a little creepy. It would have been nice if they had a heads up 'sexuality content' disclaimer. She has watched PG-14 shows and I have never had to turn the show off before this. To be honest I wish I could yell at someone about it.",1383523200,2,597,4.155172413793103

Picture a super squad of specialists keeping the world safe from all manner of aliens and cosmic anomalies. Torchwood comes in to save the day when an event or crime seems something beyond the usual. They are lead by the daring Captain Jack Harkness who has some secrets of his own. This is an adult series with adult themes but it is a pure pleasure.

I am not a homophobe and I have no problem (not much anyway) seeing gay lifestyles depicted on television if it done in a normal and natural fashion. The scenes in this show were about as natural and welcome as a prison rape. Nearly every character in a majority of the episode flip-flopped their sexuality with the casualness and frequency of changing their socks. It was so over-used that it became the central theme to the show and the plot of fighting aliens secondary. I kept hoping the writers would get it back on track but 5 minutes into episode 1 of season 2 it was clear they were going to continue and I will not return to the show, which is a shame because I was really excited when I finished Doctor Who and saw it listed amongst Amazon Prime's offerings.",1378944000,,945,4.5321637426900585

Eve Myles, playing a British police officer, joins Torchwood, headed by the immortal Captain Jack, played by John Boorman, who first appeared in the Doctor Who series.  She has to forget her history as a police officer, although that training does have its use at times, and learn to deal with a world unknown by most people.  The interaction between characters, some times amusing and sometimes tragic, and the magical world that Torchwood touches makes this an incredible adventure worth experiencing again and again.",1378512000,,773,5.062992125984252

3191043,5,B000VWE5OY,"I was expecting a sci-fi or paranormal program and this came out of left field. The idea of a secret agency chasing aliens is not original but Captain Jack Harkness and his wonderfully flawed cohorts make it a watchable program. Captain Jack is a cross between Kenny in South Park, Mulder in the X-Files and, well, you have to watch it.",1378339200,,336,4.524590163934426
3191044,5,B000VWE5OY,An interesting combination of characters. Captain Jack Harkness keeps everyone wondering- gay or straight or bi. Any way about it the man is a super talent. I hope this will continue to be produced though I hear it is on hiatus at present.,1378252800,,239,4.5813953488372094
3191045,4,B000VWE5OY,It is a very good series.  It sure isn't an American series; since it has some different sexual situations you would not find on US Tv.  A good spin off from Doctor No.,1378252800,,168,4.0606060606060606
3191046,4,B000VWE5OY,"While providing an intersting travel through the time-locked Cardiff of the Doctor Who universe, the sets were distractingly poorly made and the acting was occasionally over the top. Otherwise a very well written and executed series",1378166400,,232,5.472222222222222
3191047,4,B000VWE5OY,Sci-fi from the BBC for all to see here in the USA. Since cutting the cable cord we have had to find other sources for TV viewing and Amazon Prime seems to be great so far. Torchwwod is one of my favorites.,1378080000,,206,3.9285714285714284

3191049,5,B000VWE5OY,I enjoy it.  Nice fantasy and it is predictable enough so that I can just listen to the audio and glance at the video once in a while without missing anything.,1377734400,,159,4.129032258064516

3191052,5,B000VWE5OY,"This is a graphic, sexy, syfy drama that hits you right in the gut. Dr. Who alumni Captain Jack Harkness leads a team of special ops that keeps the world safe from ghosts, aliens, monsters, and any other weird stuff. Captain Jack is more of an anti hero to Dr. Who's feel good story. Jack is willing to handle the dirty work that frankly would turn Dr. Who's stomach, but that's why Who knows he is necessary.

3191055,2,B000VWE5OY,So implausible I couldn't get myself to watch the second episode... perhaps the writers can imagine a more realistic scenario in future.,1377216000,,136,5.2272727272727275
3191056,4,B000VWE5OY,"It's a great show but needs more comedy in it.
It would make it more fun to watch and more interresting.",1377129600,,104,4.0
3191057,5,B000VWE5OY,Great! Love this series. And it's even better given that it is a spin off of Dr. Who. Go BBC!,1377129600,,93,3.7
3191058,4,B000VWE5OY,"I can't understand why they couldn't have toned the content down just a tad, so that at least
older teenagers could watch the show (as it was with Doctor Who), but the story lines are
excellent, the dialogue is good, and the actors are quite good.",1376956800,,247,4.391304347826087
3191059,3,B000VWE5OY,"I would have given it 1-2 stars but embarrassingly, I'm a sucker for the current day sci-fi.  There are just so few shows even close to replacing X-files/alien investigation type plots that I would not want to turn anyone away that's looking for this type of show.  Surprisingly, it has more plot than say Primeval (currently showing 2013).  It is just that some of the lines in this show are hilariously tacky, that unless you a die-hard for this kind of alien thing, you'll probably settle for some other kind of sci-fi.",1376870400,,522,4.6521739130434785

3191062,3,B000VWE5OY,It seemed to go okay.  The story arc needed some more help though.  It was told decently but something wasn't resonating very much as I watched the first episode.  I think they needed a plot first and then introduced the characters and the settings.  Seemed to be a little bit more reversed than it should have been?,1376438400,,316,4.491228070175438
3191063,4,B000VWE5OY,"Not as cohesive as i'd like it to be, but well worth watching.  Some  main characters not as likable as I am used to",1376352000,,116,3.7916666666666665
3191064,5,B000VWE5OY,"This spin-off is a darker, more grown-up show than its parent show, 'Doctor Who'.  But it is fantastic!  The charming Capt. Jack Harkness is a much more complete character, full of mystery, anger, sexuality, and resolve.  His team at Torchwood is a socio-psychological study in PTSD.  But it works.  All the angst, terror, pain, sex, and play create a team that the watcher is at turns delighted with, frustrated with, and always fascinated by.

And John Barrowman as its star is absolutely, fantastically, wonderful.  Were he not the embodiment of Capt. Jack, he would be nothing short of the Doctor himself.",1376352000,,609,4.97029702970297

3191066,4,B000VWE5OY,"If you think this show is about a team tracking down aliens, then don't expect to much. Its a little bit of the Outer limits, the twilight zone and invaders. Take your pick. The American lead actor of the team is pretty good, but the British police women is kind of goofy and sleeps with quite a few guys in various stories. The stories keep you watching the show and not the sex scenes",1376179200,,386,4.22972972972973

Its Dr Who (10th DR style...), but with more death, more violence, and highly sexually charged at times...both hetro, homo, and bi-sexual...Torchwood holds no preference or grudges.  Get past the smut, and the storyline will grab you, hold you, and twist things.  You will not see many plot twists coming.  Ahhh, the Face of Boh...",1374624000,,355,4.866666666666666

3191085,5,B000VWE5OY,"We started off watching this series on Season Four and liked it so well we startd watching every season.  Show is a lot like X-Files with a British twist.  Group of characters pursue unusual police cases.  Most turn out to be aliens of some kind. Love the cast they've brought together for this seris.  Main character (Jack) is American, which helps make this series easier to relate to.  Highly recommended.",1374364800,,408,4.771428571428571

3191088,2,B000VWE5OY,"After me and my husband watched all the episodes of Primeval on Netflix we thought we would give Torchwood a try.  We assumed it would be similar to Primeval with a sci-fi edge.  You know what happens when you assume!  First of all, I cannot even watch the show without subtitles.  Being an American I had a hard time picking out some of the characters dialogue, especially the Welsh actors. I could catch some words but definately not all of them so we had to watch with subtitles so I wouldn't miss important dialogue.  Secondly, as we have only watched 6 to 7 episodes so far I find the show to be one of those that you either love or hate.  It is not very engaging like I hoped it would be, it is somewhat dullish at times and some of the acting is either too much or too little?  The story lines are interesting enough but the execution of them isn't phenomenal.  I think the one with the evil fairies is the only one I have liked.  I don't care for the barrage of language or the unnecessary sexual comments but that's just me!  I think at this point my husband and I will abandon the show if some viewer can assure us it will get better as episodes progress.  Comments very welcome!",1374278400,,1189,4.263392857142857

3191092,4,B000VWE5OY,"Campy sci-fi in the vein of Dr. Who.  Most of the plot lines are fun to watch, a couple were more violent than necessary, but worth the watch anyway.",1373760000,,149,4.137931034482759
3191093,4,B000VWE5OY,"I'd say, the first two episodes were good, or interesting, then there was a drop for 2-3 shows where they struggled with identity (Did they want to be Dr. Who(ish) or not?) Then, everything settled down and the show took a wonderful turn for the better and established a reasonably unique identity they can be proud of that is more Alfred Hitchcock meets The Twilight Zone in nature than the comic strip sci-fi of Dr. Who.

By the 9th show of the season Torchwood took off on a sprint.  They tossed off any likeness to US produced shows like ""Fringe"" or ""The X-Files"" and embraced the odd, sci-fi human drama that I remember from the black and white TV days of the Twilight Zone where Burgess Merideth played the last man on earth, finally having all the time in the world to read any book he wanted...before he broke his glasses and could not read with out them. I'd say that they were more like Alfred Hitchcock Presents except with a returning cast, setting and characters.

I would not say that these shows are ""like"" the twilight zone"" only that, in the same way that the ""Twilight Zone"" could air an episode one week that is more Action Adventure and Science Fantasy (as John Wyndham of Triffods Fame might call it), the next week the show would be a dark, quirky human story about how ""one should be careful about what one wishes for.""  This isn't slip shod and peace meal either, as one might think from what I've said so far.  Like most modern suspence/thriller/sci-fi shows, there is a multi-layered plot at work keeping the entire plot organized and effecitve and various sub-plots to work out that keep things interesting that last for 2-3 episodes before working themselves out in an entertaining and interesting way.

This is GOOD STUFF.

And when it gets to episodes 8, 9 and 10, make sure you bring a box of tissues.  If this show had been in the US, it would have been a challenger for Best Full Length Show at the Academy Awards.",1373500800,,1947,4.527065527065527

3191108,2,B000VWE5OY,I am a big fan of Dr. Who and loved when Captain Jack was on it. I thought I would like this series too. I had read that it was more adult than Dr. Who. They were correct. I didn't like that the f-word was used multiple times. The sexual innuendos were way over the top. I didn't like it at all.,1371772800,,295,3.774193548387097

The main character is American so no accent to deal with. This show is too good for me to include spoilers, but I especially liked episode 7 and 8 and will probably watch the entire series. True to European T.V. it's a little sexier than our shows, both with language and nudity, but i think it made the people real. Episode 1 will hook you...",1371686400,,473,4.386363636363637

However, there is too much gratiutious and graphic sex and violence (like an episode about cannibals, complete with a butcher shop full of human body parts or another episode about a giant, docile extra terrestrial that is caught in a meat shop and slowly butchered alive).

I definitely can't recommend this show to anyone.",1371427200,8,401,4.728571428571429

3191113,5,B000VWE5OY,"I wandered over to Torchwood from Dr Who and the shows share the same ""universe.""  Capt Jack Harkness, the head of this investigative unit based in Cardiff, Wales that supersedes both the police and the govt, first made his appearance in a Dr Who episode.  An enigmatic charming character who isn't at all shy about his sexual interests (both sexes), he is one of the biggest draws for me for Torchwood.

In the first episode, we are also introduced to the other members of Torchwood, who are also each fascinating and strong-willed in their own right and so don't always get along as a team.  Great fodder for the show, definitely, as we explore these characters and their interests and quirks over the course of the series.  They aren't perfect and they don't always get along and they keep secrets from each other.  Plus there is always the mystery of Capt Jack to keep us guessing.

My second favorite, after the incomparable Capt Jack, is Gwen Cooper.  A former cop, she stumbles across Torchwood and just can't leave it alone, eventually finding herself drawn into the world of aliens, alien technology, time travel, and the like.  She is a breath of fresh air, warm and determined, one of the better female tv characters in a long, long time.  She tries to balance her own ""normal"" lifestyle with her boyfriend with the demands and strangeness brought by her association with Torchwood and the people she ends up working with as they deal with the ""rift"" in space and time that sweeps all sorts of oddities into their little pocket of Wales.

The show has adult themes to it at times, so it may not be best for younger viewers without parental oversight or approval.

3191120,2,B000VWE5OY,"With the exception of two or three episodes, the entire first season is utterly disappointing. How did the original Torchwood team ever get together to begin with?! They don't respect their boss Jack, they don't work well together, they, to a person (except Jack), are out for themselves and do the most STUPID things imaginable for a group that supposedly are professionals and have dealt with aliens and alien technology for at least some time. Gwen, at least, has an excuse for being stupid - she's new and she can get away with it for a few episodes, but neither she, nor any team member have ANY growth or maturity over the entire first season. Almost every problem situation they bring on themselves for being plainly reckless and stupid. The potential for a terrific series is there, but the writing rarely lifts the show beyond marginal sci-fi. If the writers think that because this is a BBC show shown and advertised as 'adult', that by making almost every cast member omni-sexual, adding colorful language and bedroom scenes that this could possibly lift the drama out of the quagmire of painful writing and ridiculous story lines - they are SO mistaken. It's too bad, I actually like the cast, the show looks great in HD, the Torchwood set and locations are nice, the directing is good - but the writing cripples what should be an enjoyable earth-bound sci-fi show. Let's see if season two can redeem the show. If you want to see the show at its best in season one, check out Countrycide and Random Shoes. Then follow that with Captain Jack Harkness and the finale End of Days (although pretty awful, it gives the minor tie-in at the end to Captain Jack's re-appearance in Doctor Who - for you DW fans, like myself).

3191131,1,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is supposed to be this uber-elite team protecting the world from the alien menace.

If they we need them for protection, we are doomed!

They act like a bunch of untrained middle school kids (and no offense to middle school kids, actually I would rather have you protecting us than this pathetic ""team"").

I put team in quotes because they never act like a team. They constantly bicker and feud and turn on each other. And it is obvious that they have never trained to efficiently and professionally undertake the missions that they are supposed to be doing. They seem to just show up at the ""crime scene"", randomly run around, get very lucky, allow the death of multiple civilians and then solve the mystery, more or less.

They're supposed to outrank the police and the military, but they could benefit from taking a little basic training from both.

The worst part of the show is that there is very little consistency from one episode to the next (and sometimes not even within each individual episode).  In one of the early episodes, one of the team members endangers the entire team, directly causes the death of two innocent civilians, directly disobeys the direct orders of the team leader, threatens to kill that same team leader and by his actions threatens to destroy humanity.  Again, the team gets lucky and the menace is dealt with.

Now in real life, the errant team member would be punished. At best, he would be kicked off the team.  But in the world of Torchwood, there are no repercussions.  Even worse, the offending team member exhibits no remorse.

I could go on and on in great detail, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Of course, I shouldn't worry, because I would not want to inflict this nonsense on anyone.  I recommend you not waste your time.

I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I have always like the Doctor.  I liked Jack Harkness' character when he appeared in Doctor Who, but I do not like him in this.

If you want a show that does an excellent job of showing trained and talented individuals protecting humanity from the alien menace, I recommend ""Fringe"".",1368835200,16,2115,4.624664879356568

Also, the aliens are well done. But there are some major drawbacks: too much sex, for one thing. I'm no prude, but all the casual hooking up just detracts from the story line. Also, the fact that Captain Jack is gay is sort of shoved in the viewers' faces repeatedly. We get it, he's gay! Can we move on? The episodes themselves range from excellent to ""meh."" I was either watching breathlessly or stopping after 10 minutes to go to the next episode. Also, the Owen character seems to sort of go off the rails as the season progresses, which is distracting. The fact that Gwen is cheating on her live-in boyfriend with Owen is again something that just pulls you out of the story.

3191149,3,B000VWE5OY,"I like SciFi stuff. One of the advantages of a Roku with Prime and Netflix, I can try most of them.

I will admit, Torchwood was a slow start for me. I would watch an episode and not find it too interesting. The shows seemed kinda cheesy. After several attempts, it finally got my attention. Mid first season, character development really improves, the writing gets better and some of the cheesiness declines.

Capt. Jack is somewhat irritating at first. He gets less irritating as the show progesses. Also, if you are offended my gay male leads, then you might want to skip this series. However, I think the episode regarding his namesake, where they kissed, was well done. It was one of the best episodes of season one. At the conclusion of season one, the character of Capt. Jack seems to be the biggest negative distraction to the series for me. I am not sure why, he seems almost transparent and does not come across well. His character improves in a few episodes, then the mannequin type acting restarts. Maybe this is one of the side effects of not being able to die.

The other characters do a fine job. No problems.

Some of the 'monsters' have this bad Halloween costume type appearance. Thankfully, these do not dominate the series.

When it comes to mysteries and crime dramas, the UK produces some of the best, if not the best. When it comes to SciFi type shows, the UK puts much less effort into the quality. This spinoff of the Dr. Who series could have been much better done. The writing and special effects are lacking and those accustomed to the US produced SciFi shows will probably be somewhat disappointed.

The first season gets three stars. Not the best but not bad. The last half of the season is by far the better half. I hope season two continues this improvement and turns out to be at least a four star season.

The first three seasons of Torchwood are included with Prime. Season four is not. Season four has ten episodes that cost $2.99 each. So, $30 for season four. Also, Netflix deleted season four for some reason.",1366588800,,2048,4.564032697547684

From a secret base in London the group deals, in Series 1, with everything from deadly wood sprites to an alien sexual predator.  As might be inferred from those examples, ""Torchwood,"" especially in Series 1, deals regularly with adult themes and is most certainly not for children, but for the young at heart.

Although ""Torchwood"" was introduced through the Doctor Who show, where the lead character, Captain Jack Harkness, was seen in several cameo appearances, this show is not a mere recast of its venerable predecessor.

The show is not like Doctor Who which is good but it is not a good show. It does not have a true plot line and the characters are not trully developed. At one episode I realized that they would just sort of meander in to situation and then start spouting out about personal problems as opposed to the story creating a problem that must br stopped or solved.

Terrible implausible plot. I have a hard time understanding this but the ""butler"", don't remember his name, was responsible for the murder of two people-an innocent woman too! and threatened to kill the team but Jack Harkness and crew had no trouble forgiving him and welcoming him back. The plot is a rehash of the Borg from Star Trek, but the writers made a fundamental mistake, there was no internal struggle for her to be good, even though she wasn't completely upgraded. Instead she was just evil, so no sympathy for her so what a waste of time, should have watched Stargate instead.",1347321600,,748,4.674242424242424

Do you think Shakespeare's ""penny stinkers"" thought the actors were really on an island (The Tempest was actually the first episode of Lost)or criticized his verisimilitude because they couldn't hear the surf, that some medieval character from Monty Python was going to jump out to criticize the logic of using ""magic"" in the plot?

He took Torchwood Captain Jack's words to heart and he didn't care what anyone else thought about him dancing and falling in love with a man. You could tell the room respected him for it even though it was so far in the past where it was basically forbidden or it was horrible to be gay.

Torchwood as a show represents many good things. The Torchwood team represents loyalty. The relationships represents many things...it shows it's okay to be gay or bi or straight or (for Captain Jack) omnisexual. It tells people to do what the hell your heart tells you to because, like Captain Jack said, you don't know what day will be your last. Tomorrow you might not wake up, so have a damn good time tonight.

The scene was beautifully orchestrated in every sense. The whole episode was top-notch, but what made this my favortie Torchwood show of all time was the ending.

Talk about ending with a Bang.

This second episode sealed the deal for me on watching the rest of the series on Amazon Prime, it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy Doctor Who and want something a little more adult. The beginning sequence says ""The 21st century is where it all changes"" and it doesn't lie, taking place in the 21st century you better believe that we're becoming more accustomed to the thought that sex does, in fact, exist, and it sometimes happens out of marriage!(GASP!SHOCK!) When the hard rule for most is  ""3 dates means sex"" I have no qualm with a show diving a little bit into our obsession with the subject to make us question how much we really need that hit. That's exactly what this episode does if you look at it beyond the sex that is used on-screen. I'm excited to see where the show goes from these first two episodes.",1341964800,3,1067,4.5
3191214,5,B000VWE5OY,"The viewer could tell that the writer put effort into the dialogue and plot of this show. The plan that the character Suzie thought of is actually very well thought out and complex. It's sort of like a mini full-circle ending, if that makes any sense. Everything that occurred in the very first episode was vital to Suzie's plan. She meant to die...killing herself was all apart of the plan.

The way the writers wrote it and the way the plan and the plot all plays out is very well put-together. It's organized in a way where you don't suspect a thing until...BOOM!!...they reveal the scheme of Suzie's, at the same time surprising the hell out of you. It makes you start thinking and connecting the dots just as they speak. I have to say, this episode is the best I've seen so far of Season 1. I also must include how I think each episode gets better than the one before, like the show, Torchwood, is still a work-in progress. I feel like the directors and writers are telling me ""The show is new, it's a work-in prgress, and it gets better...DONT WORRY!""

The actor who played Ianto, I thought, convinced me of his love for the cyberwoman (although half the episode I was thinking and shouting about how stupid he was...but then again love does make people do stupid things). I liked how Jack was taking charge and forcing everyone to make hard choices. He understands way more than everyone else, especially traveling with the Doctor (that is involved...right?) so i thought John Barrowman's acting was good, as well. This episode was the best so far. At parts it made me sad, angry, and nausiated (especially when Ianto hugged the pizza girl with Lisa's brain...that was really creepy).

I don't really understand the other reviews...I actually liked this episode.",1341792000,,807,5.022388059701493

I figured out that this was because the way film is shot in Europe is different from how it's shot here in the USA. Something about the lines of resolution or some other techie gibberish. Regardless, I like it.

I really love the story lines and the characters; however, I'm still trying to get used to how fast characters are killed off in British shows. I was first introduced to this maddening act in MI-5, and now I'm seeing it in Torchwood. Other than that, the show is a great sci-fi show.",1341619200,,643,4.31404958677686
3191217,3,B000VWE5OY,"If you want, you can skip this season entirely and go directly to the superior Season 2, which makes enough sense without having seen this one.  This Doctor Who spin-off (watching Doctor Who beforehand is not required) concerns a semi-secret (all the locals know they exist, but not what they do) organization called Torchwood, whose mission is to defend Earth against alien invasion.  There's a time-space rift in Cardiff, Wales, so most of the action is based in that area.  The team is led by Captain Jack Harkness (apparently all of this first season takes place before Jack first meets the Doctor.)  We're introduced to Torchwood via Gwen Cooper, a cop, who is recruited into the team in the first episode.  Rounding out the team are Owen, who performs the autopsies, Toshiko (""Tosh""), hacker and gadget girl, and Ianto, who's a... ""tea boy""?

There's apparently a contingent of Ianto fans.  This must be based on later seasons, since the character simply doesn't have much to do this season, with the exception of ""Cyberwoman,"" and the less said about that episode the better.  However, there are two or three lines in that episode that makes it worth watching once.  But only once.
My favorite episode would be ""Out of Time,"" involving 3 folks from the '50's falling through the time-space rift into the present day.  Fans of horror movies may prefer ""Countrycide.""
Ratings wise, there are two ""sex"" (without nudity) episodes, as well as gore, violence, swearing, and Gwen's boyfriend's naked backside, so I'd put it at about an R rating, but a light R,  more towards the PG-13 end of the spectrum rather than the NC-17 end.

3.5 stars (ignoring Cyberwoman) rounded down to 3 stars because I gave Season 2 4 stars.",1339113600,5,1721,4.836177474402731

There were places in the story line that the track (as crap as the music they selected was) would have fit but instead they played it at really weird times and made the story seem disjointed. But this has definitely been one of the better episodes so far, storywise. They weren't horribly depressing, there wasn't sex for the sake of sex, and the acting wasn't miserable (also I agree with the previous rater and that without Owen this episode got better for me).",1338422400,,635,4.72972972972973

You have two women and one man who can't get their tits out of the way long enough to get anything done and a group of writers who give the impression that they can't go more the twenty minutes without some sort of sexual release. Add it all together you have 'Torchwood'. I watch it somewhat with the same eye that I use when passing a traffic accident. You don't want to look, but you still crane your neck a bit and keep watching. It is very sad.

Ianto should have been terminated at the end simply because he has shown that his own emotions are far more important than the lives of others. He fought for what he wanted to be, not what was. that is dangerous in even an average life, but to put a person in a position of power who is motivated by their sexual rage rather than reality is stupidity. those who can identify with this group are sad and beyond redemption.",1336521600,,612,4.2844827586206895

I really like scifi and powered my way through five seasons of Primeval without a second thought about the usefulness of the time I spent on it but this episode made me feel silly for watching.  The previous reviewers aren't lying, the acting is bad in this one (except the Japanese guy, so the guest actor with the fewest lines did well at least).

Some positives: To be fair, they did a really nice job on the fake body with all the metal stuck through it.  Aces to the prop team, and even though Lisa's metal suit design would look at home on the set of Power Rangers (or Xena) it was at least really well built.  Oh, and the actor who plays Jack was good at acting like he was being electrocuted.  That's all the positives I've got.

As a fan of the Whedonesque shows, as well as other strongly character-driven things like Battlestar Galactica, it was easier to do a lateral entry into Who. Torchwood was perfect for this. The ensemble cast and the Jack Harkness character prepared me for the strange Whovian world. Great monsters of the week, great season plot arcs, brilliant dialogue!",1329868800,,442,4.986486486486487
3191226,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a team centered on its leader, a mysterious man with an unusually long history given his apparent age, and the team he has assembled to manage aliens and deal with apparently supernatural events, some but not all related to a rift in the time-space continuum, which just happens to be located in Cardiff, Wales.  Some sci fi, some fantasy themes, and some truly original ideas.

There is a LOT of variety in the episodes.  Part of this is that they use a variety of writers who have different ideas, but I wonder if perhaps they were instructed to NOT try to make this look like it was all the same writer.  The characters are developed across all episodes and they still make sense with these differing plot lines, but the subject, mood, and purpose of the episodes vary wildly.

Sex plays a role in some of the stories.  It is never very graphic or revealing, but it certainly is not restricted to heterosexuality.  Indeed, the team leader is openly gay, and there is a very romantic story about him and a lover that never quite was, in his distant past.  If it would disturb you to see a romantic or lusty kiss shared between two people of various gender combinations and orientations, this show isn't for you.  I thought it was very nicely done.

On finishing the first season, we decided to go through the various show recaps, which give background about each episode, including details on how they created the visual effects.  I would not call them ""special effects"" in that there is not a lot of computer-rendered animation, rather they show how, for example, a man is hit by a car and goes flying over it.  It is very convincing, and it is interesting and educational to see how they did it by filming various parts and then edited them together carefully.  Although I enjoyed watching the episodes, the recap deepened my appreciation for both the stories and production, based on what the cast and creators had to say about them.

I love listening to the characters speaking the local dialect and with the local accent.  There are phrases and expressions that use English words that are outside of my understanding, thus something to learn.  The downside is that at times I miss what they are saying.  This problem is solved by turning on subtitles, something we do for shows where the local accent sometimes overwhelms understanding (The Wire is another example).  But having the words up makes it easier to learn from the way they talk.

Overall it is a very good series, and we're enjoying it a lot (now in Season 2).  It makes up for its flaws with truly creative ideas and acting.  It is not destined to find its place among my all-time favorites, but it is very entertaining and well worth watching, though quite variable.

MINOR SPOILER

Torchwood is an anagram of a famous and long-running BBC serial in which the central figure of Torchwood was first introduced.  I have not seen the episodes from the earlier show, but my sense is that his history is consistent with what is in Torchwood.

Took me a few years to take a peek. I'm real picky about my Time Lords. Maybe that why I dig Jack and his motley crew. He's not quite a Time Lord yet, just another schmuck caught in a bizarre loop of cosmic wonder while carnage and Armageddon storm down a shadowy alley.

But Jack is still around, and his maddeningly perfect features make up for his maddeningly perfect features. Gwen evolves from curious imp into bossy denmother, and sadly the sexual tension between her and Jack is put on the back burner because of faulty contraceptives. But Torchwood: Miracle Day promises more of the same but with palm trees and probably American guest stars.
My absolute favorite parts of Torchwood are the graphics and the theme music. The opening theme has got great spooky vocals, the closing theme is this amazing eclectic mash-up that uses elements of the original Dr. Who theme. But the show is OK.

3191257,1,B000VWE5OY,"There are two traps into which a spinoff of a popular show can fall.  It can either lean so heavily on the show off of which it spun that it never escapes that show's shadow and becomes nothing more than a pale imitation of a much better program (Sarah Jane Adventures), or it can go to the other extreme and bear so little resemblance to the original that there's nothing to draw in fans from the parent show.

Torchwood here falls into the latter trap.  You've got Jack Harkness, the always bad-ass part time companion to the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, to attract DW fans; but once you get past him, there's no Dr Who here.  There are stray references to this and that minor element of the revival; the hand which the Doctor lost in ""The Christmas Invasion"" is kept in a jar in the background; and Jack makes cryptic reference to his desire to find ""the right kind of doctor"" in the pilot and again in the finale.  There's an episode that's about Cybermen . . . sort of.  (Actually, it's no less about the Cybermen than most of the Cybermen episodes of Tenant's run were.)  But this Doctor Who spinoff bears no meaningful resemblance to Doctor Who.

That's not a bad thing necessarily, of course, if the show can turn into something interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, it doesn't, not in this case.  The cast of characters pretty much kills it. Of the four original characters, Owen is an unlikeable jerk who's got the obnoxiousness of half a dozen Donna Nobles and all the redeeming virtues of John Simm's--no, Eric Roberts's!--Master, while Gwen, Tosh, and Ianto (Geez, who came up with these names?) are just uninteresting dweebs. As for Jack, Barrowman makes the character such a joy to watch when he's in a Doctor Who episode, but for the most part he seems to be just phoning it in here.

The season does manage some good episodes. The pilot was certainly an enjoyable watch, and the next episode, which chronicled Gwen's first day on the job, was interesting.  (Gwen joins Jack as a first-tier character; the other three are distinctly less important. I won't say they're the Scotty and Sulu to Jack and Gwen's Kirk and Spock, but if you watch the opening titles and notice that the other three actors' names appear to be separated from Barrowman's and Eve Myles's by several blank lines, you'll see what I mean.)  This episode was about an alien who had a sexual obsession, and it was pretty enjoyable.  Unfortunately, the sexual obsession set the tone for the rest of the season, but more on that in just a bit.

From there on out most of the better episodes are driven by guest stars--and there are some good guest characters in here.  There were a couple of episodes whose plots didn't rely on any characters, but on phenomena. One dealing with fairies felt like it could have been an okay Doctor Who episode, and I suspect it would have been quite good if it had brought in DW elements, but Jack tries to solve it on his own and it leaves the episode with the sense of a potentially good idea not realized.  There's the Cybermen episode I mentioned above, which was only so-so on an objective standard but shines a lot brighter due to its less-than-lustrous companions.  ""Countrycide"" is a disturbing one.  (By the way, according to the Wiki it's the first episode in the DW universe to involve no science fiction elements other than a time traveller who's not what he seems since the Fifth Doctor story ""Black Orchid,"" which was itself a throwback to the straight historicals of the William Hartnell era, when the show was supposed to be educational.)

Most of the episodes focus on a regular character and try to kick off a character arc.  This makes sense for the first season of a new show, but the results are not pretty.  We don't really get an episode on Jack, partly because we already know him from his Doctor Who appearances and partly because, for the purposes of this show, he's got a real air of mystery about him that would dissipate if his teammates learned what makes him tick.  (And maintaining this mystery for the characters without frustrating curious audiences is almost the only thing that this season does well.)  There IS an episode titled ""Captain Jack Harkness,"" and that one features Barrowman to about the same extent that the various character episodes starred the actors playing the characters being focused on, but it's not about Jack.  It's about the other Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity was stolen by the Jack we all know of love when he first landed in the Battle of Britain to attempt to con the Doctor, right before the events of ""The Empty Child.""

Each of the other four gets at least one episode to try to develop their characters, but this is where the show really falls apart. As I alluded to above, there's a tremendous amount of sex here. Now Torchwood is specifically advertised for adults-only audiences, so that's not objectionable in and of itself.  Sex is often a useful tool for advancing the plot of adult fiction, and certainly a little gratuitous sex never killed anyone, but they go way overboard with it on this show.  Sex is the only vehicle used for any kind of characterization, and it REALLY wears thin.  (Interestingly enough, Jack--who's notorious among the Ninth and Tenth Doctors and their companions for flirting with any man, woman, or alien he meets, unless duty has forced upon him some urgent need to keep his mind on other things--shows no more interest in sex on this show than most normal real-world adults, despite being both surrounded and WRITTEN by nymphomaniacs.)

Gwen has a season-long subplot in which her lover--a genuinely nice guy named Rhys, and the only recurring original character a viewer is likely to develop any sympathy or affinity for--gradually grows less and less willing to accept the unpredictable hours of Gwen's new job--all he knows is that she's working for a kind of ""special ops""--and especially the evasiveness and dishonesty that creeps into their relationship as Gwen's life becomes increasingly affected by stuff that's confidential.  This very nearly worked, and would have, if the writers had portrayed Gwen as being torn between the equally valid demands of love and duty.  Unfortunately, on this show, anything interesting gets traded in for an extra dose of sex, so Gwen uses this secrecy to conceal the fact that she's taken another lover.  (That's not a spoiler, by the way; the audience learns of it almost immediately.  Only poor Rhys is left in the dark.)

The three second-tier characters each get an episode where a lover pops up out of nowhere and leads them to question their loyalties to Torchwood. We learn next to nothing about the characters this way.  In fact, I'm having a hard time thinking of a cheaper way to do characterization, and that's made even worse in the cases of Tosh and Ianto, whose characters are more or less reset to what they'd been originally almost immediately and go through the remainder of the season only minimally changed.  As for Owen, he becomes an even bigger jerk after his short-term lover leaves him, setting up a two-episode arc which I'm going to spoil below because it illuminates just how badly these characters can ruin a story.

As I said, Owen's short-term lover leaves him and this drives him to become an even bigger jerk. In the penultimate episode he goes against Jack's orders and does something incredibly stupid and dangerous, killing hundreds of people in the process. In the finale, the ripples of his decision quickly get away from him and he indignantly demands that Jack clean up his mess.  Jack starts by firing him for insubordination, though the other Torchwood members make half-hearted attempts to save Owen's job (instead of standing up and cheering, like the audience is doing).

Jack's having no luck fixing things, and then Owen barges back in and proposes doing something that will make the situation even worse.  Jack is prepared to use force to stop him but Owen gets the other three to mutiny. Jack reminds each of them why they suck and they respond by killing him--something that's happened quite a few times this season.  You'll recall that ever since Time Vortex-possessed Rose revived him after he bought it against the Daleks in ""The Parting of Ways,"" he's been immortal and recovers from all forms of deadly injury in seconds.  In this one case, though, he stays dead for several minutes, which gives Owen and Friends the opportunity to release a spawn of Satan on the Earth, as per Revelation--which seems pretty out of place considering that a good deal of the season was spent not-so-subtly pushing an atheist agenda.

What follows is a five-minute fight with a fake-looking city-stomping monster.  The whole thing feels more like an episode of Underdog than either Doctor Who or any of the other shows to which Torchwood has been favorably compared: The X-Files, CSI, a few others. The ending is pat. Jack dies and undies again, even more slowly this time because he'd run the immovable object of his immortality up against an irresistable force, the Death Lord. Then he again makes reference to ""the right kind of doctor.""  Almost immediately, the Doctor's hand starts glowing, we hear the sound of the TARDIS, and Jack runs off.

Since I watched all of Doctor Who before turning my attention to Torchwood, I know he's running off to return to a much better show and to take part in one of its best story arcs, the return of the Master for the twenty-first century revival. (I had always wondered where he was coming from in such a hurry in the opening scene of ""Utopia."") Unfortunately, no sooner did I remember this than the disappointment I felt when he turned down the chance to resume being a companion at the end of ""Last of the Time Lords"" was retroactively enhanced by realizing that he was just going back for another season of more of this crap.  I doubt I'll be joining him.

Sorry to spoil the season finale, but I feel it was necessary to show just how bad this season was.  I wouldn't quite say it should be avoided at all costs, but if you watch it expecting anything other than bland sci fi adventures and oversexed losers, you're in for a big disappointment.",1308441600,9,10227,4.7044307347167695
3191258,3,B000VWE5OY,"I watched this episode thanks to Amazon's streaming and it was worth the price ($0).

While there were some interesting twists in the plot, it seems as though I've seen the devices in many of the horror movies that I used to think were originals (a notion that age and experience have helped alleviate). The trapped couple fighting against a maniac, the rest of their crew of unsuspecting campers trying to figure out what's going on, a village overtaken by a combination of madness and (perhaps) hereditary insanity, and a truncated ending are not very original. Such things, to me, point to a show that is in decline or is trying to ""reach out"" to those who might not be familiar with the show's heritage and its plot divergence (thanks to Captain Jack) from Doctor Who.

All told, it's not a bad episode. But for me, at least, the trite cliches and absurdly predictable plot leave a lot to be desired. From its heritage I would have expected social criticism and an hour of de-tangling them from the overall structure of the story once the narrative was over. This is not the case--less than 10 minutes later I'm writing this review.

The exception is that the Captain was more well acted.  Camera work is certainly sub-par, though it is comparable to others of the BBC in picture quality it is not in handling.  Somehow I watched episode 12 rather than the 1st but I think this gave me the best idea of how bad it could be.  While this is not going to matter to everyone the main character, the Captain, is gay and you will at least watch men kissing.  I know that doesn't matter to everyone but if it does bother you there is the heads up.  Overall I think the show is a overly dramatic version of Doctor Who",1307145600,3,904,4.430303030303031
3191261,5,B000VWE5OY,"Like, the title of this review says, just...wow.  I have just finished watching the entire series and I LOVED it.  I had heard of the show before, but never gave it much thought.  I've always been a fan of the X-Files and CSI, which this show is somewhat similar to, but I just never really watched it.  I'm glad I decided to give the first episode a try...I was hooked from the start.

What I especially love is the writing and the acting.  Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper is great.  She is probably the heart of the show.  Sure, John Barrowman is the lead character, but Eve somehow just gives the show heart.  Don't get me wrong; John is incredible in his role as Captain Jack.  I never saw the show Dr. Who, so I can't really compare him to what he was like on that show.  I think that the episode that stands out for me is ""The Keep Killing Susie"".  I loved the twists and turns in that episode; just when you think she (Susie) is dead...she's not and we have no idea why until the final 20 minutes or so of the episode.

Torchwood is definitely a darker drama/action/sci-fi and every now and then humorous show.  I just hope I am able to watch the fourth season in some way.  It's going to air on a channel that I do not get and hopefully BBC America will still be able to pick it up (or it'll maybe be available on Amazon Instant Video...???).  At any rate, this is a show that I wish I had discovered when it first aired.  Thankfully it's on DVD and I am eager to watch the bonus features on the DVD.  So far I have only viewed the actual episodes, so this will definitely be a 'bonus'.",1306627200,,1587,4.147540983606557

3191263,5,B000VWE5OY,"Often touted as the ""darker/more adult"" Doctor Who (which, to be fair, is more ""family-friendly"" than for children _per se_), Torchwood is arguably a different sort of show in its own right. The setting is Earth and the focus a group of humans grappling with the unknown in the form of a rift in space and time--situated right on Cardiff--that regularly spews forth all manner of alien species and technology. Originally formed by Queen Victoria as a counter to the supposed threat to the Earth represented by the Doctor and other alien life forms (and with an agenda of British imperialism above all else), Torchwood has since been reformed by Captain Jack Harkness in tribute to the Doctor's more humane, multicultural and egalitarian ideals.

Which doesn't make the ride an easy one for our protagonists--as one might imagine, with relative free reign (few even in the government are aware of Torchwood's purpose and existence) and powerful tech at their disposal, moral conundrums abound. The very first episode demonstrates the temptations of the job, as well as the moral and mental toll it can take upon fallible human beings.

In accordance with the show's opening narrated by Jack, that ""the 21st century is when everything changes"", expect your prejudices and beliefs to be somewhat challenged by this show. Moral ambiguity, hard choices and fluid sexuality abound (not entirely surprising for a show broadcast during the ""watershed"" time period for more adult fare). The Welsh setting adds colour and reminds us of the regular people and everyday routines of life being protected by Torchwood (and, I must admit, has caused me to fall a little bit in love with this part of the world).

To sum up, a somewhat darker offering than some Doctor Who watchers may be accustomed to. But like a good chiaroscuro painting, the moments of darkness make the moments of light stand out that much more--particularly through the character of PC Gwen Cooper, recruited in the first episode as much for her empathy and humanity as for her bravery and perseverance. Make no mistake, these are the ""good guys"", warts and all, putting their lives and sanity on the line for the sake of the human race.",1303516800,5,2194,4.940379403794038
3191264,2,B000VWE5OY,"About Torchwood Series::
Here in the USA (mid-USA anyway) Doctor Who has always been a show that I could recommend to families.. where the parents and Kids (and now my grandkids) can watch together and laugh at the old special effects and the jump at the new ones. I know of many Families who wouldn't be watching if Doctor Who had the crap of Torchwood going on!

I really don't even want people know that I watched Torchwood! But I must WARN others!
I bought it cause Capt. Jack was on Doctor Who. I thought it would be clean (sheeesh!)
 When I got online and complained to someone in a WHO talk thread somewhere else...
They said it got ""way better"" in the ""Children of the Earth"" .. well ...
I guess.... ""Way Better"" is really subjective.  It did get better ... but not ""WAY"" better.
I needed a bath after watching!
I DELETED the whole lot of ""Torchwood"" from my Online Video Library

I liked the fact that Gwen finally told her husband what she was doing and that he could share in the job!
That sharing cemented their relationship! I loved that part!

Else - Torchwood was trash! If they bring Torchwood back CLEAN .. I will be a fan. You betcha!
Story line was pretty good take out the TRASH (Sexual content (both hetro & homo) & language though.
A little less gore would be good too!

You can elude to raunchy withOUT really putting it in. I can fill in where there might be something with non-raunchy stuff. Kids wouldn't have the experience to do this. They would just see the story.

I have a great imagination. Yeppers I do! HA!

EDIT:: JULY 10, 2011
I just got done watching TORCHWOOD Season 4 Episode 1 ""Miracle Day""
I gotta say I was really pleasantly surprised!!!
NO Explicit Sexual Content! Not too much swearing!! A little gore but it kind of fit cause you had to show people having really bad accidents that normally would have caused them to be killed instantly .... so it wasn't too much as to detract.
The characters were just trying to figure out what was happening on ""Miracle Day"" so things might change ....... time will tell.

3191283,3,B000VWE5OY,"This is a review with a bit of a difference considering I've never watched a single episode of Doctor Who in my life (I'll get to it eventually), despite knowing that ""Torchwood"" is a spin-off of that entertainment juggernaut, and in fact derives its name from an anagram of its mother show. But I'd been told that knowledge of the prior show was not strictly necessary, and thought perhaps I'd be able to watch with fresh eyes and without inevitably drawing comparisons with the original show.

Gwen Cooper is a young police officer who happens to be present when a crime scene is interrupted by a mysterious group of people who are offhandedly referred to as Torchwood by her colleges. She watches in astonishment from a nearby car-park building as the team use a gauntlet to temporarily resurrect the murder victim, and begins her own private investigation into discovering who exactly these people are.

Turns out that Torchwood is a secret organization ""outside the government, beyond the police"" which is led by the enigmatic, charismatic, long coat-wearing Captain Jack Harkness, who is intrigued by Gwen's disapproving point of view on their activities. After being introduced to the rest of the team: Doctor Owen Harper, computer genius Toshiko Sato, faithful butler Ianto Jones, and second-in-command Suzie Costello; Gwen learns that there's a rift in space and time over Cardiff, resulting in an influx of aliens, time-travel and other bizarre occurrences that require a specialized team of experts to deal with. That's where Torchwood comes in.

Unexpected tragedy means that a space opens up on the team, and Jack invites Gwen to join in order to infuse some degree of humanity in the business-like dealings of the Torchwood team. She agrees; a decision that will change her life forever. Thirteen episodes in all, the show purports to be a grownup sci-fi show that melds the detective work of CSI with plenty of sex, gore and violence. For the most part the episodes are standalone, with little continuity between them (unless you count the meaningless entanglements that the staff have with each other or with one-shot guest stars), and many of them follow basic sci-fi storylines. There's the one with the parasitic alien, the time-traveling visitors, the alien fight club, the device which reads minds, etc.

Yet when the show finds its feet, it suddenly becomes very, very good. Jack Harkness is an intriguing character with a mysterious past and an immunity to death. His agenda suggests that he knows more than he's letting on, whilst simultaneously being just as baffled about his own existence as the rest of his team. The scenes that centre on him and John Barrowman's boisterous, enthusiastic, larger-than-life performances are invariably the scenes worth tuning in for. Other episodes such as ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" have intricate plots, nuanced characterization and themes on the nature of life and the cost of immorality that are truly thought-provoking.

To make a long story short, the first season of Torchwood is a mixed bag. There's plenty of potential, and lots of pay-off, but the characterization and general content are often frustrating. For the record, I don't consider three stars a ""bad"" review by any means, but to my mind at least, the biggest detriments of the show are threefold.

As mentioned, the show tries to pass itself off as ""adult"" by making it a darker and edgier version of Doctor Who. Here's the rub: the process of making something ""darker and edgier"" has been interpreted as ""adding more sex, profanity and violence."" This does not automatically make a show more adult, in fact it has the opposite effect and can make it seem quite juvenile at times. Despite repeated claims by writers and producers in the DVD extras that their use of sex and violence is not gratuitous, most of the time it *is* gratuitous and serves no real purpose beyond giving the writers the opportunity to point at the screen and say: ""look at how edgy we're being!""

Another serious problem is the fact that many of characters simply aren't very likeable: not in the ""flawed but human"" way, but in the ""what a jerk!"" way. Essentially, most of them act like irresponsible and immature children, only with sex drives that they can't seem to keep in check. The drama of the show doesn't derive from characters grappling with moral conundrums or with the weight of the responsibility placed on them, but from their inability to keep their pants on. The relationships they foster are shallow and meaningless, and the audience is given little reason to care about any of them.

In particular, the focus of the show keeps coming back to Gwen and Owen. Although Tosh is a cool intellectual and Ianto is a sweetheart, the writers seem to be more interested in making most of the plots revolve around Gwen and Owen; the former an inconsistent character who never seems to do the job that she was hired for, and the latter a complete jerk. Gwen is apparently meant to be the empathetic one, but this usually involves her trusting the wrong people, getting aggravated with her team mates when she feels they're not being compassionate enough, and cheating on her boyfriend.

Owen is meant to be a dark, smooth ladies man, except that the actor isn't really handsome or charming enough to pull it off, and in his first appearance he's using an alien aphrodisiac to entice strangers into having sex with him. Wow, just like a sex offender with date-rape pills! Later he makes a rather disgusting proposition to Gwen whilst he has her forcibly pinned against a tree, and by the end of the episode they're sleeping together. Even Jack, ostentatiously the main character, is marginalized in favor of these two.

Finally there are also some things that just plain don't make sense. If Torchwood is a secret organization, why do they drive around in a giant SUV with flashing lights and blaring music? Why is this team of ""experts"" so ridiculously incompetent and disorganized? What exactly is it that they do that couldn't be done just as easily by the local police force? If they're above the government, where do they get their funding? (admittedly, the answer to this may lie in Doctor Who, where it was first introduced). Why do they have a pterodactyl flying around their headquarters, and who cleans up after it? Is it just a coincidence that they're all bi-sexual or is it something to do with the rift? (I just think four out of five bi-curious characters are rather unlikely odds).

Yet my three-star review does not mean that I think the show is bad - not by any means. The episodes, whatever else their faults, are fast-paced, well acted and built on a solid premise. There is room for much improvement, but the promise is there, and (according to general opinion) is acted upon in the second season.

This DVD box set boasts some exceptional extras: along with the usual deleted scenes, outtakes, making of featurettes, and interviews with the cast and crew, it also has a commentary track for every single episode, something I've never seen before (usually they opt for just one or two). There's even a segment in which John Barrowman grabs hold of a microphone and belts out ""Anything Goes"" for a 1930s audience. The enthusiasm and care with which the cast and crew discuss the show is contagious, and it's difficult to really condemn a show that so many people obviously enjoy being a part of. Although I was not hugely impressed by Torchwood's first offering, I'm sufficiently intrigued to give season two a try.",1285027200,11,7545,4.876755070202808

I didn't dislike like Torchwood, but it seems to offer nothing original nor has any particular strong points; if one takes away the ""flash"", there is little left.  As an example - The first show after the opener is very similar to a ""New Outer Limits"" show staring Alisa Milano(sp).  She was possessed by an alien that wanted sexual energy; Torchwood just re-presented this theme with more ""flash"" different cast and venue.  The ""Outer Limits"" version spent more time on character development and plot, the actors were more engaging and it was simply a better (deeper, richer) story (and I'm not that much of a fan of the New Outer Limits).  Torchwood seems geared to ""entertain"" a certain demographic, and it's following a formula to do it.  The series is not up to what one would expect from the BBC with respect to story quality and acting.  I may have been somewhat entertained, but it's basically junk food.",1269820800,2,1129,4.783505154639175
3191287,4,B000VWE5OY,"""Torchwood"" is a British science fiction series, shown in the United States on BBC America.

The series is a ""Doctor Who"" spin off. While ""Doctor Who"" is considered a family show, ""Torchwood"" is more adult in content. It contains explicit sex, gruesome murders and some pretty nasty aliens. Most characters turn out to be bisexual. Indeed, the fictitious Torchwood Institute seems to be a veritable LGBT love fest!

The closest thing ""Star Trek"" ever came to homosexuality were a couple of strange alien races. ""Torchwood"" is the real thing. How about same-sex kissing between Allied officers in pretty uniforms (one of them a time traveller), interracial lesbian sex with a shape shifting alien, or swinging from a straight robot to a gay human? Well, at least they have diversity on this show!

Weirdly, the plot is set in Cardiff, Wales. Hardly a place anyone would consider the gay capital of Britain. The story revolves around the Torchwood Institute, a secretive operation charged with hunting down aliens from outer space and retrieve alien technology. The leader of the operation is one Jack Harkness, a mysterious human with supernatural abilities whose real identity is never revealed in the first season (of course, avid viewers of ""Doctor Who"" know exactly who he is). A rift in space-time runs right across Cardiff, turning the city into some kind of alien boomtown. Most fascinating are the Weewils, monstrous aliens living in the sewage system but occasionally making it to the surface, attacking people. To make the story a little bit more believable, the Torchwood Institute controls a drug known as Retcon, which wipes out the memories of everyone who ever sees the aliens. Torchwood are, after all, above the government and beyond the police!

So far, three seasons of ""Torchwood"" has been produced. I originally only watched the second season, and drew the hasty conclusion that the show isn't much to write home about. The last couple of weeks, I've also been watching the first season episodes on Swedish TV. They are much better. In the second season, the monsters are just too corny and the characters too weirdly depressed. One of them even becomes a zombie. The first season also borders the corny at times (what about the cannibals? Or Abaddon?), but overall it's perfectly acceptable.

Unless, of course, you have a problem with bisexuals...",1268870400,2,2369,5.048593350383632

This is not intended for children and may even be too much for the PG-13 crowd; it is great story telling for adults and does not dumb down the show for its audiences - something that many Americans will find uncomfortable at first, but then will be highly disappointed by the production and story telling of American broadcasting and cable fair.

Sadly instead of bringing us the show as it was intended, FOX plans to create an Americanized knock off which will once again, as with ""the office"" be good but still not be likely to match the quality and story telling of the original series:  it is truly a shame that broadcasters in the US do not respect their audiences enough to air overseas hit shows as they are and not ""fix them"" for us.  In other words, I recommend that you watch the BBC version of this show either online or by purchasing the DVDs.",1265500800,3,1209,4.527522935779817

3191290,3,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is an anagram of and series spin off of the 'Doctor Who' franchise.  Dr. Who was awesome to such a point where I was interested in even the ancillary shows, so I viewed Torchwood, hoping for more.  No luck.  What really makes Dr. Who great is the acting and characterization of the Doctor himself.  Torchwood has nothing like him.  It's budget is low, the Weevils are silly, and the relationships are a mess.

The relationships, let me go into them more.  If male/male and female/female is your thing, you'll love Torchwood.  In the first season every one of the five main characters gets a same sex kiss, and often more, much more.  'Edgy,' which should not be confused for 'good plot' or 'good acting.'  Now this is something I could live with if the science fiction element was as strong or interesting as Dr. Who.  A couple episodes which didn't concentrate on the main cast like 'Random Shoes' and 'Small Worlds' were really good.  They carry the show up to three stars for me.

Probably the biggest dislike I had for the show was how Captain Jack Harkness reacted to his subordinates.  They don't follow his orders.  They don't listen to him.  He's 'in charge' only during the tense chases when they have a clearly defined enemy.  As soon as a decision comes along which doesn't have immediate consequences, they ignore his orders.  This never ends well, and by series finale, become more of a question of 'Why are these people still employed at Torchwood?'

My favorite character was Suzie, because she really personifies the tone and spirit of the series.",1263513600,3,1573,4.716911764705882

Inconsistent characters?  Check.  Usually there would be no plot if the characters acted predictably and sensibly, after all.  A number of people have commented negatively on the persistent sex (mostly kissing and talking about sex -- very little else happens on camera), which personally I think is one of the best things about the show.  It's pleasantly silly & over the top, especially coming from Captain Jack.  Admittedly if you're offended by characters breathing heavily at each other, this is not a series you will enjoy.  To me the one enormous negative is the character of Gwen Cooper.  She's unbearable.  Gooey brown eyes that round with hurt or surprise at every opportunity.  Empathy that bleeds out of her in ridiculous directions. Snuggle-bunny-ness with boring boyfriend.  Guilt, guilt at not being able to be home for dinner.  I find myself muttering ""silly cow"" almost every time she does or says anything.  She can't even turn her phone off when she's hiding from an alien. Silly cow.  The other female character, Tosh, is only mildly pathetic, and all the males are entertaining in different ways.

And love is more important to Jack than sex (although, in the second episode, we find out that he'll bonk anything that moves).  For anyone who doesn't know it, this series is a spin-off the the newest Dr. Who series.

But, there are other things, too.  The fact the series (1) isn't set in space; (2) not set in a big city (Cardiff is about the same size as the city I live in) and (3) Barrowman and his co-stars make the stories feel real.

The characters live and die.  They have real lives that we learn about, which makes us understand them more fully.  There is laughter, loss, powerful stories and stories that can keep you on the edge of your seat (even if it is an uncomfortable way to watch anyone).

3191299,5,B000VWE5OY,"Looked at in the whole of his work, Russell T. Davies used his run as executive producer of Doctor Who (2005-2008) to expand the universe surrounding the Time Lord.  Using the Doctor Who anthology as a jumping off point, Davies was able to build the premise that brought Elizabeth Sladen back into the Family of Time as a more mature Sarah Jane Smith...and through the first two series of Doctor Who, built the foundation that led to Torchwood; using ""The Unquiet Dead"" , ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" and ""Bad Wolf/Parting Of The Ways"" from Series One; then ""Tooth And Claw"" and ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday"" for establishing the hows and whys for the Institute.
  It's obvious that the BBC decided that that, in spinning off one of the characters from a reimaging of The Doctor, the one that HAD to be spun off was Jack Harkness.  As portrayed by John Barrowman, Captain Jack was too handsome, too tragically heroic, too charismatic...and too adventurous (Both in his work and his off hours) to NOT have a storyline built around him.  In many ways, Captain Jack is another vision of the Doctor; sort of an off-kilter reflection that one might see in a Hall of Mirrors.  Jack is immortal but wishes for death, a leader who demands his team follow his leadership yet keeps secrets of his past (Their future) from them...Barrowman has matured Jack from his introduction...SOME.  Certainly, he is a more severe and understanding human in Cardiff than he was during his time on the TARDIS...and this plays out over the 13 episodes.
  Barrowman's equal in this series is the brilliant Eve Myles as the police constable turned Torchwood police liaison Gwen Cooper.  Cooper, a descendant of the housemaid Gwyneth from ""The Unquiet Dead"" (Something that was retconned in Series Four of Doctor Who), observes Torchwood reanimate a corpse in the series opener (""Everything Changes""), and begins a winding trail to--oddly enough--becoming somewhat of a ""Companion"" to Jack.  Myles is an oddly attractive woman--once she gets out of the PC uniform and into regular clothing, she has a wonderful body with that odd gap between the front of her upper teeth--which somehow makes her more human and appealing.  Gwen's adjustment to working at Torchwood--the sequence in ""Ghost Machine"" in which Jack teaches her how to user firearms--makes Gwen almost seem a natural for the unique mission of Torchwood.
  The rest of the Torchwood team--the medical specialist Owen Harper (Given an angry, arrogant edge by Burn Gorman--at least until ""Out Of Time""), the computer/systems specialist Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori, played as a bit of a wallflower save ""Greeks Bearing Gifts""; in which we find out she holds a torch for Owen) and the administrative specialist Ianto Jones (Gareth Lloyd-Davies, who never seems to have a hair out of place or his suit out of joint--well, except for ""Cyberwoman"" and ""Countrycide"") round out Torchwood Three.

  Torchwood is a series that delves into the seamier side of Doctor Who's world.  The basic premise of the Torchwood Institute--a first line of defense on Earth against aliens (Aliens in this case defined as beings from other planets AND dimensions in time and space) allows for the issues that might inhabit any law-enforcement unit--relationships (How Gwen cannot tell her boyfriend, Rhys Williams, what she does...or as the season goes on, who she's sleeping with), the usage of what the team garners through the rift, and the potential for corruption from those items.  This is the theme of the first episode, in which the usage of one of the items...and it's corruptive, corrosive nature...leads to the death of one member of the team...and opens up the spot that Gwen fills.  From then on, the season veer wildly--aliens consuming bodies during sex, devices opening portals to the past, cannibals, fairies that aren't all sweet and nice, mind reading devices...oh yeah, and demons looking to consume all life.
  Overall, Torchwood is a wonderfully different take on the Whoniverse.  It is at times sadder, a little more visceral, and definitely more intense.  Barrowman and Myles give the series a heft and weight that couldn't be displayed in Doctor Who.  But that weight and intensity is why Davies gave this series a run...and it works.
  Highly recommended.",1248307200,,4288,5.036827195467422
3191300,2,B000VWE5OY,"Well, I was originally drawn in to this world by Dr. Who series 1. It was well-played and put together nicely... just the right amount of ""cheesiness"" and humor. Good. I liked it. Series 2 of Dr. Who with the cast changes was not as good in my opinion, but whatever.. My point is.. when Captain Jack's character came along, it was a nice addition. I liked the story arc he was part of. Well done, fun, all that. So I was excited for Torchwood and finally downloaded the season (1)  the other day.

I gotta say.. everyone does a great job with the acting, aside from Captain Jack. (John Barrowman) He just seems to be WAY over-doing every line and action. It really makes it a task to watch, becuase his cast-mates are doing a fine job. I guess I just expected more. There are undertones of bi-sexuality and homosexuality throughout various episodes. I have no problem with it, but they often seem out of place. It takes away from the story when it is unnecessarily forced into a scene.

3191301,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood, is as the product editorial says is a spin off of Doctor Who, but unlike most spin offs, you do not need to watch or follow Doctor Who to watch it as it is truly self-contained.

Torchwood is kind of like the the British version of X-Files, if it was created and aired by HBO.  Basically that means that there is a lot of stuff that has been touched on like same-sex relationships and romance to affairs, but at the same time never leaving the scope of the plot, so you are not bogged down by these scenes.  Every episode is basically contained with in themselves so the story lines does not really follow each episode.  There are the exceptions like with the two part episodes, or when they have to bring back something to help bring a story around.

Overall I will give this 10 out of 10 and can not wait for season 2 to come out on Blu-ray (Come-on BBC release Season 2 on Blu already).

I also would recommend that you watch this 10 episodes of Doctor Who, as it gives some more insight of Capt. Jack:

At first Torchwood was original, intriguing with a good group of actors.  That would be this Season.  But don't let yourself get hooked!  Season two takes a horrible turn for the worse.

In season 2 it seams the writers are trying to make sure every character ""bats for both teams"" and everyone sleeps with just about everyone.

I'm not a homo-phobe: there are questions about my dad who still rooms with the same guy he left my mom for.  My husband has a cousin everyone wishes would come out.  It is part of our world today.

But this show makes it seem like it is natural for everyone to change their minds.  Take the butler like guy.  In the first season he is pining over his girlfriend that he's hidden int he basement. She's half robot.

Season II:

He and the Captain become lovers.

It was my understanding that either you are or you aren't.  You don't just wake up one day and decide to swap teams.

Add to this that the main character, the girl - I'm really bad with names - who is shacking up with her boyfriend.  She decides to have a romance with one of the guys in Torchwood.  It seems every other episode is about who's doing who.

3191305,3,B000VWE5OY,"Too often an episode of Torchwood reaches its climax with Captain Jack standing in a column of irradiated light, his handsome features contorted in pain, screaming either, ""pen the Rift!"" or ""Close the Rift!""  Since we never did figure out what the Rift was nor why it should be either opened or closed, we haven't yet come close to the ideal experience of Torchwood which, on the face of it, should be one of our very favorite shows.

It has, seemingly, everything, an unusual location, a provocative theme, some passable acting, a good looking cast, and that Doctor Who pedigree.  And how many shows use anagrams in their title, so that's cool!  And yet whenever it begins, I get distracted, looking at Owen's unappealingly foxy face; the little twerp is supposed to be the sexyboy on the show, but to me he looks like a pocket version of the late Don Knotts.  Then there's Eve Myles, gorgeous and gaptoothed as Gwen.  In Season One she quits her job on the regular police force to join up with Torchwood, the secret branch.  Either they present some episodes out of order on the DVD, or Gwen forgets she's married whenever it's convenient for the writers (if she's not married to the guy at home, forgive me for not understanding the Welsh).

Torchwood's mission, to repel aliens, seems boring after a bit.  And xenophobic and nationalistic.  Why are the aliens uniformly presented as unattractive, in fact evil freaks?  Is this how outsiders are welcomed in Cardiff?  Then excuse me if I stay home, despite the way the city skyline and marina have been photoshopped to picture postcard perfection for the filming.  As for Ianto or whatever his name is, on any other show he'd be an extra; here requiring him to memorize and say lines smacks of exploitation.

He flirted with everyone and had a great time doing it. Of course, they were going to make a spinoff.

And then the spinoff came and it turned Jack into a dull school marm in a classroom full of bland creeps. The first four episodes are pretty good but eventually it becames too apparent that Gwen, a miserable Mary Sue character, is going to be the center of the show. And she's awful. She has to always be on some kind of sermonizing moral trip. When she ""accidentally"" kills someone (who by the plotline fully deserves it) she gets weepy. When she is in a situation where it's kill or be killed - she decides to drop her gun and wait for Jack to rescue her.

And then halfway through the season the show decides to explore the rest of the cast. And they are even more boring. Tosh is sad. Owen is a jerk. Ianto has a sexy cyberwoman girlfriend. He's been hiding her in the Torchwood basement for over a year and somehow no one has noticed.

Even more fun, RTD just hits us over the head with his two sermons - pacifism and atheism. The former is typically hypocritical since he can't seem to write a character that might NOT deserve death to save his life. The latter is just irritating.

I was warned about its edge and sexuality, so was not surprised at some of the content. Overall the series could be a lot better. I agree with most reviewers about the homosexual and athiest overtones. I don't have a problem with gay characters or references, but in Torchwood's first few episodes all the gay and bi-sexual content does nothing to advance the plot. The atheism in the first episode also serves no purpose. I have heard that Russel T. Davis is gay and watching this almost feels like him saying ""I am gay and an athiest and am going to work that in wherever I can."" Mr. Davis did a wonderful job of reviving Doctor Who, but I think Torchwood should have undergone a few more rewrites. The show is entertaining, but would be a lot better if I didn't feel like I was constantly being slapped in the face with Russel T's personal messages. If you are a big Dr. Who fan I would not automatically recommend this. Check it out before you buy it.",1237766400,4,1063,4.373737373737374
3191308,2,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood was supposed to be the ""adult"" spin off of `Doctor Who' but apart from a few splatter of blood and gratuitous sex scenes (no nudity), it would have insulted the intelligence of a normal 10 year-old.

It seems as if the talented writer and producer Russell T Davies has taken the best ingredients from other shows and movies and combined them into Welsh's omelets.

We have a team of ""specialists"" investigating unexplained mysteries (this reminds me of Buffy, Angel, the X-Files, Fringe and even Scooby Do) Torchwood even has a black van/SUV that they travel around in. Torchwood has a charismatic leader just like CSIs. They're a top secret government agency (""We're separate from your Government, outside the police, beyond the United Nations,"" says team leader Captain Jack Harkness) and chase aliens (like the ""Men in Black"" - they even have a way of wiping people's memories).

The Torchwood team even has a row of prison cells identical to those in ""Silence of the Lambs"". However, probably due to the show low budget, the cells' Perspex windows are very thin and it keeps making me wonder why the dangerous aliens in the end cell couldn't escape from their flimsy cells. The Torchwood team also has a pet pterodactyl nesting in the roof yet the place isn't littered with pterodactyl wastes or whose job it is to clean it up. The Torchwood team also let pterodactyl out to fly around Cardiff where for some miraculous reasons the thing went unnoticed by the general population.

Imagine am omelets made from the best filet mignon, a spoon of caviar, a splash of Old Spiced, a grated David Bowey CD and one of Tom Brady dirty socks, would you eat such an omelets? It's all the more depressing since this comes from the talented Russell T Davies.
I watch many Sci-fi shows from Doctor Who to the new Battlestar Galactica and Fringe and the different between those shows and Torchwood is that the scripts from other shows work hard to create a plausible reality unlike Torchwood.

Accept for the character Captain Jack, the rest of the Torchwood team themselves is made up of stupid, ignorant, arrogant, selfish, unprofessional dolts who readily sacrifice the lives of innocent people and other team members for their own benefit. Gwen, the ex-policewoman new recruit and one of the main characters of the show have a dopey lived in boyfriend who does something boring. She professed to love him and promptly shag one of her male co-worker. Yet when the stupid boyfriend learns of his girlfriend betrayal, he quickly forgives her and continued to live with her.

In ""Doctor Who"", Captain Jack was the charismatic, flirtatious, try-sexual secret agent from the future who tries to have sex with male, female, she males (I'm not sure if your pets and farm animals is safe from the Captain). Yet in Torchwood he became a one dimensional character who dated his male subordinates, mopes about the place like a lovesick schoolgirl, his whole appeal stripped away. In another of the show's many visual non-sequiturs, Captain Jack stand on the tops of very tall buildings for no good reason, like Batman, broodingly staring into the distance. The many, many impressive aerial shots of the city that pad out the episodes must have cost lots of money but did nothing to enhance the plot.

Take the plot of the second episode, for example, which was lifted entirely from one of the episode of ""Doctor Who"". Except now the villain isn't an alien, trapped inside a television, that feeds on the electrical energy of the human brain, it's an alien trapped in the body of a jailbait teenage girl who shag people to death in order to absorb their `orgasmic energy'. Torchwood duly captures her and locks her up. Gwen goes down to the cells for a chat and, affected by the alluring pheromones the alien gives off to attract its prey, ends up in some hot lesbian action. The rest of the team just watches the whole thing on CCTV unconcerned that their colleague is playing ""tongue hockey"" with an alien parasite.

Torchwood season 1 is just plain awful, hopefully, season 2 and three will be much better and Russell T. Davies will make serious improvement on the characterization instead of beating the viewers on the head with his pro-Wales, pro-alternative lifestyle agenda.

This series is no where near as good as Doctor Who despite being a spin off of the show.

3191315,4,B000VWE5OY,"I'm so tired of watching people post reviews of the shows, especially before the DVD is out, that this review focuses on this DVD set that you can buy at Amazon.com.

In seven disc you get quit a bit.  All 13 episodes of the show unedited as you might have seen on the BBC America Channel as I did.  Now, most of what was cut out is development of character and plots, sorry they didn't really cut out additional sex folks, but I thought most of it was useful.

Many of the disc contain what are called ""deleted"" scenes and these vary from what appear to be last minute cuts to first level editing where the full sound and music is missing.  What I would have really liked (part of the one star reduction in rating) is for these deleted scenes to have been available closer to the actually episode they were cut from.  It would have been very cool to have the option to add them back in and watch the show.

The sound was odd with a lot of softness in the introductions on most of the episodes but this sound problem did not continue in the episode itself.  Nothing new as far as I could tell in terms of sound.

Probably just as many hours spent on these ""featurettes"" about filming and the actors if you are interested in that sort of thing.  Personally I'd prefer these things removed and the price dropped about $10 or so myself.  This is damned expensive for what in America would be a half season of shows.

Given that if you are a real fan you may want to invest in these. If not, borrow them from the library or a friend and check them out.",1234742400,,1548,4.2101694915254235

I have been watching TW since the 1st episode and I love it. It has a lot of action, drama, humor and there is some same-sex snogging(kissing) so if that bothers you don't watch. It all centers around a group of people that work at TW an organization that was formed to deal with alien threats on Earth. There are a few TW offices and this one happens to be in Cardiff, where Captain Jack says there is a rift in time and ""things"" from ""out there"" keep popping up in Cardiff. The series begins with the introduction of Police Constable Gwen Cooper, our link to TW so to speak for we are as lost as Gwen is when she stumbles on them. There is Captain Jack Harkness a guy from the future and the past, Ianto Jones the ""gopher"" coffee/tea maker but he will become much more then that in due time, Owen the doctor and resident ladies man, Toshiko the computer wiz.
To give you an idea of the series here are the episodes and a brief discription, no spoilers promise,and rating 1star worst 5 stars great.:
Epi. 1: Everything Changes- Gwen Cooper comes across TW, and Jack discovers that rules aren't always followed. 5*
Epi. 2: Day One- TW has to stop a sex addicted alien as it leaves a trail of dead bodies. 5*
Epi. 3: Ghost Machine- Gwen gets hold of an alien object that gives you visions of past crimes. 4*
Epi. 4: Cyberwoman- Ther's a dark secret in the basement of the Hub. Even jack is unawareof it, but Ianto knows. And he'll go to any lengths, sacrifice anything and anyone, to protect what's down there. 5*

Epi. 9: Random Shoes- The invisible spirit of a hit and run victim tries to convince Gwen to locate the alien that might have been responsible for his death. 4*
Epi. 10: Out of Time- A 1950's passenger plane arrives in 21st century Cardiff, can the TW team help them assimilate to modern life?5*
Epi. 11: Combat- The team discovers a ring of that are kidnapping Weevils (aliens) for there own mixed up reasons. 3*
Epi. 12: Captain Jack Harkness- The Captain and Toshiko are transported to WWII Cardiff, there Toshiko soon finds out that being Japanese at this time is not that good and they meet the real Capt. Jack. Back in the present the rest of the team have to battle there own demons in order to find a way to bring their friends back, but things are going to go horribly wrong. 5*
Epi. 13: End of Days- The rift is splintering, strange things are happening all around the world. These events resemble those in the prophecy of the arrival of Abaddon, the Great Devourer, who will lead the world into shadow and bring about the End of Days...5*

So ends season 1 of this great series, I recommend you get it in Blu Ray because this is one of the few shows that is actually filmed in HD, and it looks incredible. I really like the interaction between the characters and the way they all seem like very rounded individuals and not paper cut outs.

Sadly, I was bored to tears before I got to the second disc, and quite halfway through that one. It was just dull -- badly written, badly paced, poorly acted. In particular, the central character of Jack Harkness is played with one of the worst Brits-doing-an-American accent performances I've ever seen, a stiff, unconvincing, pale imitation of Tom Cruise-ish macho cool... Which is weird since Great Britain has no shortage of fine actors who are perfectly capable of doing spot-on Americanisms. Anyway, this series is not very good -- the sci-fi concepts, such as they are, can be seen in much more engaging versions in almost any other medium -- movies, tv, books, comics, you name it. This was disappointing and rinky-dink... not worth your time, really. (Axton)",1233187200,3,892,4.798701298701299
3191320,4,B000VWE5OY,"I picked this up because how can you not watch a show about a team of people lead by John Barrowman?  I'm glad I did, too.  It delivered.  Captain Jack (Barrowman) is the head of Cardiff's Torchwood.  It's a secret agency that deals with keeping aliens and time rifts in check.  The show picks up when Gwen is recruited as a new Torchwood agent.

Torchwood is darker than Doctor Who and for a slightly older audience.  It does deal with some more adult aliens and has many innuendoes of adult nature, but it's all done in good fun.  As was said by show runners and critics, it does seem to follow a format each week-- Alien comes, chaos ensues, Torchwood wins.  There is some character development, but we get much more in later seasons.  The cast is amazing.  They all seem so natural and you'll find yourself becoming attached to them quickly.

Overall, I give this 4/5 stars.  I recommend continuing on with the series after this, as it just gets better and better!",1233100800,,968,4.494252873563219

If you are a Doctor Who and Sarah Jane Adventures fan like I am that does not mean you will be a Torchwood fan.  I commend it for being a new kind of scifi show like there has never been done before.  It is very original.  I like dark things, but not the way this show is dark.  It has too many atheist and homosexual overtones to the point of being unrealistic.  At times you think that the main point of the show is about atheists and homosexuals.  If you could take those out with some good old Doctor Who style writing the show would have great potential.  Eve Myles who plays Gwen Cooper looks very beautiful as always.  She was also in the 3rd episode of the first season of the new Doctor Who series.

Dr. Who has never interested me that much.  Sometimes I watch some of the new Dr. Who on PBS.  I can take Dr. Who or leave it though the new Dr. Who is fascinating to me as a character.
I am mesmerized by Captain Jack though.  He is the man all men want to be with -- straight or gay.  His sexuality (actually it seems that for him, a non-human, human categories of sexual preference are silly and irrelevant) never seems to be an issue.  He can seduce anyone.",1232668800,2,703,4.395348837209302
3191323,3,B000VWE5OY,"My children and I recently discovered the new Doctor Who programs and we were impressed by the intelligent scripts, the superior direction and sometimes outstanding acting.  This prompted me to order the anagram series Torchwood, billed as ""a grownup sci-fi.""  Doctor Who lead writer Russell T Davies conceived Torchwood and wrote the initial episode, which seemed to be very promising.

Alas, the reality fails to deliver on the promise.  The scripts don't provide us with a ""way in"" to the central characters and thus we never really come to care about them and their travails.  The challenges they face - aliens and other oddities crossing a temporal rift to invade Cardiff - are too simplistic and monotonic.  Some of the scripts struggle for relevance (for example, Meat, in which ordinary people are not for the last time the villains) but the single-episode story format is too confining.  Although Torchwood is supposed to be for adults, the scripts are actually much less intelligent than those for Doctor Who.  It's a shame, because the actors here are probably capable of much more, if only they had better material to work with.  Torchwood seems to be striving to be a less banal version of the X-Files but in the end doesn't rise to anything more than forgettable filler.

Several reviewers have commented on the sexual aspects of the series but in reality there's very little sexuality on display, and that which is shown is just kissing and loving gazes.  Americans may get worked up over the same-sex stuff but let's face it: any for-adults European show is going to contain material that US citizens will find disturbing.  There's a huge cultural gap between Europeans and Americans and Torchwood reflects that, but it's not really integral to the show, any more than are the ringtones on their mobile (cellular) phones or the fact that despite all the high-tech stuff they don't seem to be able to get frame-mounted tactical lights and laser target acquisition devices for their handguns.

In short, this is a series that could use a serious make-over in the scripting department, with a lot more emphasis on plot and character development.  If Doctor Who can assume that its audience of children is capable of following clues and subtle hints and can handle emotion to a considerable degree, why on earth would Torchwood miss out on precisely the things that made its parent series so compelling?  Davies clearly needs to return to the concept and beef it up, or the BBC should do the decent thing and opt for euthanasia.",1232236800,3,2540,4.901869158878505
3191324,1,B000VWE5OY,"I thought Torchwood would be more of a Dr. Who type sci-fi adventure show. Instead it is a crude imitation of X-Files. I was particularly put off by the foul language, graphic sex and violent content. Not for the kids by any means.",1231891200,24,231,4.395348837209302
3191325,3,B000VWE5OY,"I am a great fan of sci-fi movies. I usually do not miss a single sci-fi film or TV show. Torchwood captivated me from the beginning, and I was looking forward every night to watching an episode. I liked the characters, though I did find them a bit shallow, unintelligent, stubborn, prone to mistakes, and unwilling to learn from their mistakes. In the real world, such mistakes would lead to criminal prosecution, and in the very least, an immediate discharge. For example, one character (I won't spoil it for you by giving his name) disobeys orders and opens a rift in time that puts the whole planet in danger. No big deal, he is forgiven! A little far fetched, don't you think?

What really put me off is finding out that the lead character, and hero of the series, Jack, is a homosexual.  OK, we live in a world where this is acceptable, but why show intimate kissing (with open mouth and tongue) between the same sexes? Are the writers trying to tell us that this is completely acceptable? Is this series about space aliens or sexual morality? Won't children be watching this series?

I would have easily given this series a five star rating, but because of the sexuality, I give it a three star rating, and I definitely do not recommend it to children!",1231718400,2,1259,4.561946902654867
3191326,1,B000VWE5OY,"I wanted to like Torchwood, and was well disposed to after Jack Harkness and the Torchwood organisation/s were set up on Dr Who.

But this is rubbish.  Everything about it is disappointing: the writing, characterisation, continuity, acting, directing, editing, music, sound editing, lighting, and special effects. Perhaps the producers were too ambitious for their budget, or perhaps they felt they could rely on the cheap-and-cheerful plastic rocks and rubber monsters that populate early Star Trek and most of the Dr Who series and not bother with essentials like writers.

Everything is wrong with this series, so I shall only discuss the writing.

The characters are inconsistent, irresponsible, shallow, immature and stupid.  Their dialogue is often stilted and inane; there were only a few moments in the entire series when a line stood out as being at all insightful or witty.

The relationships between the characters are also shallow and unappealing, and the focus is, as many reviewers here have stated, mostly crude sexual opportunism.  I have nothing against depicting sexual relationships on tv, but the immediate rush of first kisses is not the interesting part. But that's all we get in Torchwood; the writers don't bother to explore the relationships in depth, to develop compatibility or explore the consequences of infidelity and rejection, or bother to maintain a credible emotional arc.

The stories are just a loop of plot devices, emotional wallowing, long harangues declaimed most theatrically, and silent movie era over-acting.",1231718400,37,1551,5.380165289256198

While the cinematography and general sci-fi feel are OK, the characters (other than Caption Jack) are absolutely miserable.  I kept hoping that they would all be killed by the end, but alas I knew I would be disappointed since they are in Season Two.  Even Captian Jack was only a shade of his brilliance in Doctor Who.

I can't believe that Russell T. Davies could be associated with this.  My opinion of his writing has just taken a heavy hit.  I will certainly not be buying Season Two nor watching it for free if I can watch The Doctor in a re-run.",1231545600,3,736,4.244604316546763

Slightly disappointed at the opener, it was not until the 2nd or 3rd episode where I really started to appreciate, then love the characters and premise despite their naivte at times. After all, they ARE NOT the Doctor, they are humans who for the most part have had little to no exposure to aliens and their technology, and are basically winging it (well, despite Jack) with 21st Century know how- They don't have all the answers like the Doctor, but they carry on their mission to learn more and adapt.

It is a reflection of how the earth carries on WITHOUT the Doctor's presence and the learning curve associated with trying to deal with extra terrestrial incursions- really, did Mulder and Scully ever get this much exposure or effect when dealing with aliens? Seems like every time they got close to a close encounter, the plot did not allow for prolonged or even physical contact with their protagonists, and they were usually relegated to staring at the thing as it disappeared.

The interpretations that the characters are morally compromised, well, I am sure that everyone of us is so perfect that we can judge other's character.

If you're looking for just a Doctor Who spin-off, try the Sarah Jane Adventures, but if you're looking for something a little darker, more drama, and a lot more interpersonal characters, then Torchwood is for you.

It revolves around Torchwood 3, based in Cardiff, which is set on a Rift in Time and Space. The job of Torchwood is to monitor this rift and seek out any aliens coming through before they get out into the general public.

Torchwood is run by Captain Jack Harkness, who many Doctor Who fans will remember fondly. Gwen Cooper is your lead into the world of Torchwood, and you learn about how it all works along with her. The story line between the characters are are deep and very complex. Love traingles, squares and pentagon's abound.

Now, a word of warning...there are homosexual relationships in this show. Could be because Jack, being from the future and an alien, doesn't see male or female, he just see's life form.

Where Doctor Who (at least at its best) keeps you on the edge of your seat from the excitement, Torchwood keeps you rivited to your TV from the intensity.  Yes, Torchwood is far more ""adult"" oriented; and far less alien ""monster"" oriented.  But to me the main difference is the level of intensity.  And this intensity proceeds not just from the nature of the relationships between the characters - who are definitely not the typical one-dimensional sci-fi characters - but from the uncertainly of each episode's resolution.  I've watched all of Season 1 and a few of Season 2, and, so far,  each episode has had an unexpected turn of events at the ending.  This show, unlike Doctor Who, does not have ""happy endings.""  You always know, with Doctor Who, that  all will be made right again with the world; not so with Torchwood.  Yes, the alien entity is effectively dealt with; but there's no sense of relief.  All is not right with the world again. The resolution leaves as much loss as gain in its wake - if not more so. This was no more true than with the 2-part Season 1 finale.  Part 1 was absolutely magnificent, in every respect - as great a show as I've ever seen; Part 2, though, was a great let-down - because when the alien entity finally made its appearance, it was entirely anti-climactic, and the resolution unsatisfactory in that it wasn't really worthy of what went before it.  The loss was far greater than the gain.  It's unusual enough to see any Sci-Fi show which doesn't have a happy ending that restores everything to the way it was before anything happened; but to see one that never has a happy ending is nothing short of amazing - particularly amazing because we're conditioned to believe that saving the world from the ""bad guy"" is such a good thing that it makes everything  alright again.

3191341,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is one of the biggest surprises in Sci-Fi to come along in a long while. If you like shows like Firefly or Dr. Who, then you'll get a big kick out of Torchwood.

Torchwood reminds me alot of the comic, ""Batman and the Outsiders"" - about a team of flawed super-heroes who spend more time fighting their own personal demons than super-villians. The protagonists in Torchwood don't have any super powers (except for Capt. Jack Harkness who can't die) but they all have alot of emotional baggage and relationship issues. Throw in some Doctor Who atmosphere and the result is a real winner.

Torchwood is funny, deep, heartfelt and sexually provocative; sometimes all at the same time. A truly remarkable achievement. The best part: there will never be a lame American TV version of the show, due to the sexual exploits of the characters in the show.

Getting this DVD is a no-brainer..",1220572800,5,891,4.7727272727272725
3191342,5,B000VWE5OY,Totally Awesome series. We rented the series and fell in love with it and had to buy it as it is one you can watch over and over. The only thing I might caution anyone on is unlike American television the BBC shows are not censored like ours are so you will see some risque stuff. The characters are wonderful and the acting is amazing and it was just a huge bonus that it's a spin off from Doctor Who (The greatest series of ALL TIME!!!)

Numerous people mentioned the inclusion of adult themes but they were tastefully woven into the stories. My son is grown up so that was not an issue for me. What impressed me was the almost everyone who talked about Torchwood seems to love it so I downloaded the first 3 episodes on iTunes. It was so awesome I bought the first season and have already preordered the second one.

I am hooked and Torchwood is and will be part of my video collection. And until I get signed up for BBC America, I will be watching any new episodes on my iTouch because I just do not want to wait until the DVDs come in the mail.",1217808000,3,788,4.143790849673203

The show is about Torchwood, an organization created by Queen Victoria when she first encountered The Doctor back in the day, to protect Queen and Country. Each episode is in the format of ""monster of the week"" where Torchwood 3 (this group's Torchwood) must deal with the monster and their personal lives. Whilst engaged in the chase and danger, the show weaves in and out of each of the characters lives exploring their past and present. The show is successful because of the exploration of each character. It delves deeply into their psyches fleshing out their strengths, flaws and intentions. After watching this, you feel like you really know the characters. The first season deals with Gwen, a police constable, stumbling upon Torchwood and later joining the team, which is comprised of Toshiko (techno wiz), Owen (doctor), Jack (the leader) and Ianto (he makes coffee and looks good in a suit). The first season introducers use to the team, the rift and many many aliens.",1215734400,7,1641,6.740566037735849

[...]Very enjoyable.  Very dark, well written and interesting. My only complaint is that I could do with a bit less explicitness.  ""Dark"" and ""mature"" themes (even sexual themes) can be presented very effectively without spelling it all out for us in the form of excessive nudity, blood,  and in-your-fact sex.  [...]

3191348,5,B000VWE5OY,"This show is incredable! From the first introduction of Gwen, Jack, and the rest of the Torchwood crew, the action is fast-paced and action packed. Every episode seems longer than it actually is because of the sheer AMOUNT of story the writers and actors are able to pack into each segment. The characters are real, beleivable, and sympathetic. Captain Jack Harkness, played by stage and TV actor John Barrowman, is charismatic, cryptic, mysterious, and absolutely ruthless is carrying out the mission at hand, wether it's capturing a ""weevil"", romancing a coworker, or executing a member of the Torchwood team who's become corrupted by alien technology.

This series has several Dr. Who tie-ins, from the introduction of Jack Harkness in Season 1, to Jack joining the Doctor and Martha in Season 3 of Doctor Who, which on Jacks timeline occurs at the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2 on Torchwood. There are also multiple episodes and references to Torchwood (albeit Torchwood London, which is not connected to Torchwood Cardiff, due to a breakaway alluded to by Jack but never fully explained, at least not yet) throughout Seasons 2 and 3 of DW.

The budget for this show must be generous, as illustrated by detailed alien makeup effects, and by the Hub (Torchwood headquarters, concealed beneath the Millenium Center in Cardiff, Wales). Numerous locations in and around Cardiff are featured as part of the action, including generous slices of ordinary life for the people of Cardiff, who have no idea where their city lies on a grand cosmic scale, and what lies concealed beneath their feet.

As Jack says in the title sequence, ""The 21st Century's when everything changes. You have to be ready."" With those words, you embark on a rollercoaster journey that will have you challenged, confused, questioning, and ultimately wishing you could become a member of Torchwood.",1215475200,5,1881,5.022435897435898

The special effects are so bad that I went back to look at the box to make sure this wasn't released in the 80's. The first episode was the best, after that I could only muscle through another 5 episodes, each one getting more stilted, and boring, and far fetched. I am a geek, so maybe a little tough, but REALLY, this is about the quality of ""Earnest goes to (Space) Camp"". Save your money, I'll give you mine!!

3191350,5,B000VWE5OY,"This Doctor Who spin-off is just as ingenious as the latest incarnations of Doctor Who.  Torchwood gives us characters with depth and humanity, that battle against the odds on an almost daily basis, while being quite obviously vulnerable and fallible, as we also often see the elements of their personal lives play out amidst the ""challenges"" posed by the many and varied alien threats.  Torchwood is also not without its commentaries on our society today, in that sometimes the ""threat"" is not alien, but humans that are so twisted and evil that they are in actuality quite in-human (and thus filling the role expected of ""hostile aliens"").  Yes, we cannot help but reminisce about certain episodes of the X-Files, if we are also familiar with that series.

Russell T. Davies, who also brought us the latest incarnation of Doctor Who, has done an awesome job of bringing us a darker trek into the sci-fi genre, making excellent use of his talent for creative plots, character development, great special effects (on a budget), and much more!  He also provides us with a perspective that can be quite thought-provoking, as we consider the world of today (here on Earth), and the possibilities that the future may hold for human-kind.  If there is intelligent life ""out there"", will we really be ready for our contacts with it, when it finally does happen???  How much of the world's population today, is actually ready to live respectfully, harmoniously, and appropriately with their own ""neighbors"" on this tiny little planet that we all call home -- even when our neighbors might seem rather ""alien"" to us?

The series itself deserve 5/5. If you loved Doctor Who? and you thought: ""A little bit more violence, drama and sexual content would have been good!"" Well Torchwood is for you. Don't expect Jack to be the Jack of Doctor Who with the Ninth Doctor and Rose; he's still the same, but more secretive and what he learned from the Doctor reflects a lot in Torchwood. We see a little bit more of what he has become when Rose brought him back.

3191368,4,B000VWE5OY,"""Torchwood,"" a spin-off of the revived ""Doctor Who"" series, is a strange bird.  It can be one of the greatest shows around and then tank miserably.  The show centers around the Torchwood Institute's Cardiff operation, headed up by the dashingly handsome (and quite possibly immortal) Captain Jack Harkness (played with excellent flair by John Barrowman).  He leads a small ragtag group of scientists, specialists, etc. who set out to protect the world from bizarre aliens and other creatures that make their way to our home planet via a rift in time and space.  Some of the visitors are good, but the bad ones get the attention.  The team includes Tosh (Naoko Mori), a shy computer specialist who longs for Owen (Burn Gorman), the cocky and not-all-too-likeable team doctor.  Ianto (Gareth David-Lloyd) is the quiet and always reliable clean-up man who is basically a butler in the same vein as Batman's Alfred (although much younger).  The team is rounded out by Suzie and eventual team newbie, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), who adds heart to the team.

Fans of the new ""Doctor Who"" will recognize Captain Jack.  He's still the dashing and cocky hero that the Doctor and Rose met, but throughout the season his character becomes more mysterious and, at times, morbidly dark and heartless.  He is the glue that holds this show together.

What ""Who"" fans might not recognize is the heavy adult tone of ""Torchwood.""  The language, violence and sexual content go way beyond family-friendly.  This helps and hinders the show at the same time.  The language is about as bad as a PG-13 movie for the most part, but a few scenes get (necessarily) R-rated.  The violence is also essential for the most part, but the action can be too much for younger viewers.  I felt like much of the sexual content was thrown in just because it could be.  I have no problem with this sort of content but I do believe it should be used only when it adds to the story.  In ""Day One,"" a sex-crazed alien that survives off of orgasms (yes, I said orgasms), makes for an interesting and hilarious story.  While some may not like seeing homosexual content, the episode ""Captain Jack Harkness"" uses just that develop the character of Harkness even more.  In other episodes, there are brief encounters that really needn't be there.

The series has some excellent episodes, such as ""Small Worlds,"" a downright creepy thriller involving the activity of fairies in our world.  Another bright spot is ""Random Shoes,"" told from the viewpoint of a dead man following the Torchwood team as they investigate his death.  It's funny, interesting and even touching at times.  The top of the heap as far as series one goes, though, is ""Countrycide.""  The team visits a rural town where the body count skyrockets in cycles.  Who or what is killling off these people?  The answer will shock you.

Of course, for all that is great about this series, there are a few clunkers that almost turned me off to the show entirely.  First was ""Cyberwoman,"" which showcases a relationship of my favorite Torchwood member, Ianto.  He's keeping his semi-Cyber girlfriend hidden in the bowels of Torchwood hoping to find help for her.  The Cybermen are my favorite classic ""Who"" villains, but even I have to say that Ianto's Cyber-girlfriend was too hokey to digest.  The ending almost saves the episode, but it's the biggest downfall of the series so far.  Secondly is ""Combat,"" which features a very interesting fight club that is used to develop Owen's character a bit more.  Unfortunately, it all falls flat in the end.  Also, a couple of episodes, ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" and ""Out of Time,"" are mediocre at best.

The DVD release is very good, with excellent extras including ""Torchwood Declassified"" and extensive looks into each character and special effects.

So, you take the good with the bad and you end up with a new series that has wonderful highs and horrible lows.  I would recommend this series as a purchase since there are more pros than cons, but do not let your chidren watch this until they are much older.  I understand that many ""Who"" fans were completely turned off by the series' abrasive ways, but it's okay with me.

Brilliant acting, writing, special FX, brilliant everything! If you enjoy the new episodes of Dr. Who, you will  probably like this show. This show ties into its spin off show (Dr. Who) but it does not require the viewer to have watched Dr. Who at all although there are references to Torchwood in Dr. Who and visa versa.

It's just great. I highly recommend this. There isn't an actor who could play Captain Jack any better than John Barrowman. He's not only sexy, he is an incredible actor. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman are also amazing as is the entire cast including guest actors. My favorite character, Owen played by Burn Gorman, adds a great depth to the series that is not seen in too many modern television shows.

This is the type of series that you cannot tear yourself away from because the story lines just suck you right into the action. The first scene of episode one will get you hooked. A mechanical glove that can bring you back to life for a minute, come on now! It's brilliant!!!!! The last DVD has all of the commentary from each episode which gives you some chance to meet the actors, the creator of the show (Russell T.

3191374,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood comes from the creators of the recent Doctor Who revival (and writer / creator of the UK's Queer As Folk). Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who, for those that are interested.

Like most new shows, this first season takes a little time to find it's feet, to get you caring about the characters and feeling 'in-tune' with what it's all about. However, as first seasons go, the team have done a great job. John Barrowman smoulders his way through each episode looking fantastic but much screen time is devoted to the supporting cast members and it certainly is not a 'one-man' show.

Yes, the show deals with aliens, monsters and general threats to humankind (both real and perceived) as you would expect, however what keeps it interesting is that the worst aspects are generally related to more human emotions. Some episodes are quite dark, dealing with the worst of human frailties; jealousy, guilt, anger and obsession all wrapped up in a sexy, flirting undercurrent of repressed (and unrepressed) desire.

John Barrowman is outstanding and breaks the mould for the handsome hero/protagonist in every way possible - from his unashamed open multi-sexuality, through a 007-like callousness, to a softer caring side. Yet still he leaves tyou with an air of mystery and detachment to allow for some slow reveals as the season progresses.

This is an adult show and definitely not for the kids. It is really targeting those who have grown up with Doctor Who but want something more dangerous and sexy from their shows. Not unexpectedly some previously taboo areas are covered; lesbianism, gay and bisexual behaviour, but all dealt with in a measured and humourous way.

Two of the best episodes - ""They keep killing Suzie"" and ""Captain Jack Harkness"" really showcase the cast's talents and the real potential of this show. I'm looking forward to Season 2 to see if they can keep up the momentum.",1206403200,4,1911,4.922360248447205
3191375,1,B000VWE5OY,"I went into this series begging to love it.  I have been a fan of Doctor Who for over 20 years and love the new version.  I absolutely loved Captain Jack in the Doctor Who series, so I was so excited when Torchwood was released.

Then came episode 1.  I thought it was a joke.  Then, I just thought it would get better.  Then I assumed something was wrong with me.  However, I then watched the show with other Doctor Who fans.

I fast came to the conclusion that this is the worst show I have ever seen.  Period.  Any genre.  At all.

This is painful to say, but it is absolutely horrendous.  Terrible characters. [...]

In ever single episode, all the characters completely ignore Jack and do the exact opposite of what he says.  Then, guess what?  Chaos ensues.  You would think after the first 20 times Gwen screwed up, she would listen.  However, she's an idiot.  So are the rest.  I was hoping to god Jack would show some of his stuff eventually.  NO.  He's god awful too.

I honestly have pain writing this.  But listen to a fan.  Of Doctor Who, and all series Scifi.  My favorite show is BSG.  I love Firefly.  I enjoy Stargate (both series).  I can recommend Babylon 5, Farscape and Red Dwarf.  I hope to all scifi gods that this show does not see season 2.

The characters are so terrible and unbelieveable.  They act as though they are ridiculously stupid.  How can a black ops outfit have 5 people!!!  And 5 amazingly stupid people at that!!!",1205798400,32,1453,4.3584905660377355

3191377,3,B000VWE5OY,"I love the old and new Dr. Who and the last two seasons of the new Dr. Who are outstanding.  So I bought the Torchwood Series 1 without having seen any of the episodes on TV, just from my love of sci-fi and the carryforward of Captain Jack.  Torchwood's writing is no where near as good as David Tennant's new Dr. Who series.  The sci-fi in Torchwood sometimes takes a back seat to the character drama.  The last couple episodes of season 1 devolved into soap opera. I watched the whole series with my 14-year old daughter.  During these last episodes, we started doing chores while watching, that's how uninteresting they were. And, worst of all, we started (correctly) predicting what was going to happen next. As a sci-fi lover, it's still got some interesting stuff.  But too often, the characters' actions aren't believable.  This is some government funded super-shop, and yet, Captain Jack's employees very frequently act like untrained idiots. Over and Over. And them acting like idiots will take up 20 minutes at a time. Overall, if you love sci-fi excitement, I would recommend David Tennant as Dr. Who as a much better show.  If you like standard sit-com drama, then you may be more appreciative of Torchwood. Oh, and, yes, Torchwood is more ""adult-oriented"" than Dr. Who.  But they've said that from the beginning.  Sometimes, the ""adult"" stuff works well with a storyline, like when Captain Jack meets his namesake. Othertimes, though, it's more like filler to get the ratings up (sleaze) or it's filler to use up time (instead of good writing).  I really hope that the next season has better storylines, because there's great potential.  I'd start off with killing off all but one of his employees, and the one I'd keep is the 2nd-tier doorkeeper.

The ""Torchwood"" Organization seeks to eliminate any alien threat to the earth/ human life and to master alien technology to be used in future battles, if necessary. But You won't find the team battling some hidden alien agenda every week, as in the final seasons of The X-files.

You are more likely to see them deal with various problems: rifts in time, demons, the ""human monster"", oversexed time travelers, aliens that destroy you through an orgasmic release of energy, etc. The show is clever, arousing, hilarious, and very astonishing at times. It manages to brings the human characteristic back into sci-fi.

Not so with Torchwood!  There are a TON of extras, some of which I haven't even gotten to watch yet.  There are deleted scenes, some commentaries with the actors and actresses, all of the Torchwood Declassified episodes that the US viewers miss out on as well as the uncut UK versions of each episode.

3191382,5,B000VWE5OY,"If ""The X-Files"", ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Queer as Folk"" had a lovechild then it would be ""Torchwood""!

The show is about the Cardiff operation of Torchwood, called Torchwood-3 lead by enigmatic, flamboyant and openly bisexual Captain Jack Harkness played brilliantly by John Barrowman. His small team of experts and him monitor the space-time rift that goes through Cardiff whcih leads to all sorts of encounters with aliens, space time disruptions, dark fairies etc.

Torchwood is written with an adult audience in mind, which means that the camp is toned down quite a bit compared to some episodes of ""Doctor Who"" and the stories are neither for prudish people nor for the faint of heart (""Countrycyde"" is a real horror movie in a one hour format) The production is high-end and features the same wonderful score that Doctor Who has since Murray Gold is also in charge here.

Regarding the first series: Don't expect a perfect first series. There are very, very few series that can actually claim of having had a perfect first season and I can think of only ""Battlestar Galactica"". It is very clear that Torchwood is still trying to find its footing and that leads to a few duds now and then (especially ""Cyberwoman"") but overall the first series already has quite a few wonderful episodes to offer (""Small Worlds"", ""Countrycyde"" ""Captain Jack Harrtigan"" etc) . The real reason to forgive the duds is the wonderful cast and the fulfilled promise that it will get MUCH better in series two.

Keeping the world/England safe from aliens is the primary mission of Torchwood, a secret agency that seems to have always existed.

3191384,3,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness is more sombre and serious than his character from Dr. Who.  Strangely he is often peripheral in the espisodes that seem to revolve around Gwen and Owen.  I won't mention any spoilers, but his staff are not always behind Jack and demonstrate it.  In fact, Gwen, Tosh, Owen and Ianto, the main characters often are in need of a whack on the head for not doing what they know they should.  Professional in some ways, but emotionally each is a bit of a mess.

The stories range from very good to mediocre.  Actually I liked the two 'Suzie' espisodes best.  The special effects are good and so is the acting.

3191387,4,B000VWE5OY,"The first season of Torchwood shows tremendous promise, and that's partly where my 4**** rating comes from. The show itself has some deep flaws, most notably the change in character for Captain Jack from his appearances on Doctor Who, where he has a much more charming personality. Here he tends all too often to bark his lines and yell a lot. It seems that later in the season Barrowman finds his way again and gets Jack back on track. Of the supporting characters, there are problems as well, including too much rebellion and conflict among the team - they are, after all, people we're supposed to like and want to invite into our homes on TV or DVD, but all too often they aren't.
All of that said, some of these stories are fantastic, and I'm excited to see what they come up with for their second season! I'd recommend sci-fi fans give the show a try.",1203897600,2,856,4.45859872611465

I watched two episodes and the beginning of the third when I realized I wasn't enjoying it. About mid way through the first episode, I was wondering when the episode would be over.

I'm not sure what the writers are trying to do here. All the characters are smug and egotistical to the point where I do not care about their characters. What's more, they have this awesome responsibility of protecting the earth with alien technology and they themselves are irresponsible by abusing the technology in the first episode. Even Captain Jack, who was a fun character in Dr. Who, is too full of himself for my taste - and for me to keep watching.

The show itself seems a little cheap on scripts and themes. Not a lot of thought seemed to go into the title music either.

Maybe you start to like the characters more as the series progresses? But since the writers and actors failed to wow me at the first episode, I'll watch the first three seasons of Dr. Who again.",1203811200,6,1147,4.296296296296297

3191392,4,B000VWE5OY,"If you're in the mood for some sexy science-fiction, look no further. ""Torchwood"" is one of the most imaginative series in recent memory and deserves much more exposure than it has received here in the United States.

Captain Jack Harkness is the head of a paranormal investigations group called Torchwood. Based in Cardiff, Wales, Torchwood acts outside the law and is beyond the jurisdiction of the police. Serving as mankind's line of defense against the paranormal -- be it ghosts, aliens, or technology run amok -- they've got their hands full when Cardiff policewoman Gwen Cooper discovers the group resurrecting a dead man in order to question him about his (otherworldly) killer.

Eventually joining the group, Cooper slowly comes to realize that being a part of such a secretive agency has its drawbacks -- especially the fact that she has to hide her job from her boyfriend, Rhys.

Joining her are Toshiko Sato, a computer expert, as well as fellow agent Owen Harper and ""support man"" Ianto Jones. They're an interesting and rather complicated bunch, each bringing their own personal demons to the table.

Part of the brilliance of ""Torchwood"" is that we the audience care as much about the characters as we do the plights they face. Considering they face everything from killer fairies, country-dwelling cannibals and even rips in the fabric of time that threaten to destroy the world, that's really saying something!

Of course, one couldn't review ""Torchwood"" without mentioning its charismatic lead, John Barrowman. Truly an actor's actor, he delivers fine performances as Jack Harkness, blending the perfect mix of bravado and vulnerability, making him more than just an action-hero or a dashing  prime-time star.

While some of the episodes are of the ""monster-of-the-week"" variety (one of the series' few weaknesses) we begin to build some continuity towards the end. There are too many standout episodes to name -- an uncommon trait in most American television. Sexy, scary and often quite riveting,  I'm at my wits end now that season two has begun and I *do not* receive BBC America.

Needless to say, the BBC has outdone themselves in terms of quality. Presented in the 1.85 aspect ratio and enhanced for wide-screen displays, the picture quality is excellent. Audio is equally as good, and there are so many extras that are you'll be playing these discs long after you finish watching all twelve episodes.

So for those of you haven't seen this show, what are you waiting for? ""Torchwood"" is one of the finest series since ""The X-Files"" or ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Highly recommended!",1203552000,4,2609,5.0606060606060606

However, the show needs to pick up more and the characters need to get some chemistry.  It may be the highest rated SciFi on the BBC but I believe it is becuaseit was from the Dr. Who name.
Also, the women need to be hotter and though Jack is Gay (yes Gay) not Bi because if he was he would be going after women as much as men and so far that has not happened.  So everyone just shut up.

3191401,3,B000VWE5OY,"Certainly not a ""my bad"" for the series, but for the manufacture and design of this DVD set. As some others have noted, there are a few problems. One of my main interests in buying the set was to listen to the commentaries. But I was puzzled when I selected ""Setup"" from the Main Menu screen and saw that the Commentaries button was highlighted as ""ON."" ""Why wasn't it set to 'OFF'?"" I asked myself. When I started playing the episode, there was no commentary. I switched the settings from ""ON"" to ""OFF"" and back to ""ON"" a couple of times. It wasn't until I did the counter-intuitive thing that I found them. You actually need to select the ON/OFF box so that the word ""OFF"" is highlighted. It looks like you've turned the commentaries off, but you haven't. Turning them ""OFF"" actually turns them ""ON."" Go figure. But, hey, it's Torchwood. Maybe the DVD packaging gurus got caught in a time rift. ""So much flotsam and jetsam.""

The series ain't that, though -- ""flotsam and jetsam."" It's dark, quirky, in-your-face, filled with wonderful Welsh accents and, okay, lots of face sucking of all kinds. Contrary to another reviewer, I find most of the characters to be *full* of heart (if the final ep of the season ain't about heart, I don't know what is).

3191403,5,B000VWE5OY,There's something about sci-fi done right that no other genre really captures.  Torchwood has that something.  It's the ability to take very human concerns (such as Gwen's quest to maintain her own identity in new circumstances) and combine them with ideas and plots that stretch the imagination to the breaking point.  It's the things that move us set in a fantastical new reality.  Some movies and shows do it better than others.  Torchwood does it as well as it can be done.,1201478400,3,477,4.7682926829268295

3191405,3,B000VWE5OY,"I'm always mystified that people think a three or four star review is bad; it's not folks it just shows that a good show could use some improvement. ""Torchwood"" is one of those shows that has a lot of potential and could become quite exceptional. Russell T. Davies ""Dr. Who"" spin-off ""Torchwood"" is a pretty good show and could be an exceptional show if it layed off the sex and violence so much. Why? Because the show focuses entirely too much on it to its own detriment. The first series starts off well if a bit uneven. The pilot ""Every Thing Changes"" sets up the premise of the series but really would have benefited from a two hour or two episode set up since the serial killer story angle isn't developed enough. We meet Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman)the new head of Torchwood a MI-5 like organization that deals with threats from aliens and we don't mean illegal aliens. Torchwood (which is an anagram for ""Doctor Who"") was developed BECAUSE of the good doctor and, when all of its members were turned into Cybermen, Harkness started the organization again in honor of its original primary target--the good Doctor himself. He and his crew including Owen (who looks a bit like Willem Dafoe), Tosh and Suzie deal with alien incursions that occur because of a rift in time/space located in Cardiff. When Gwen a police officer witnessesTorchwood ressurecting one of the victims of the serial killer to try and find out his identity she starts trying to find out more about the investigation, she gets drawn into their world. Gwen is later invited to join Torchwood and assist the group and becomes its conscience filled with the compassion that have become as alien to them as the creatures they hunt.

The quality of the writing veers from weak to brilliant over the course of the 13 episodes included. As mentioned the pilot episode could have been much better (it's good but underdeveloped) if it was longer allowing for the plot and characters to be better deveoped. As the series progresses it does get better with ""Countrycide"", ""They Keep Killing Suzie"", ""Random Shoes"" and ""Out of Time"" all well written. The problem is that the show will deal with a emotionally charged issue and then two characters will decide, ""oh, let's go have casual sex right now"". It's an odd shift in tone much more in keeping with a series like ""Queer as Folk"" (also created by Davies)or ""Coupling"" than, say, ""Doctor Who"". As Davies himself states in an extra just because they can show more gore and sex doesn't mean they necessarily have to ALL the time. It disrupts some of the well written narratives and seems almost like the focus of those that are NOT well written with else everything is built around it. ""Out of Time"" and ""Greeks Bearing Gifts"" are both perfect examples where the sexuality is well integrated into the script and inseparable from the story itself. There are others, however, where is like those moments in ""NYPD Blue"" where it felt like it was the obligatory sex scene.

Regardless, I like this show and I think fans of ""The X-Files"" or ""Doctor Who"" (and ""Supernatural"") will as well but the writing isn't as sharp as any of those shows. In fact, it suffers from the same flaws (but to a larger degree)as the third season of ""Supernatural"".

The show looks like it came from an inferior source with the image quality good when it should be terrific. Perhaps in the switch from the normally incompatable European format to the US or during the Telecine process something unexpected happened or the source wasn't properly handled. Either way, it looks good but could look GREAT given the high definition video format it is shot in.

Audio sounds extremely good unlike ""Doctor Who"" the 5.1 mix sounds very good even when it is listened to in 2.0 (the dialogue in""Doctor Who"" tends to get lost in the mix with the music and sound effects overwhelming it--it's not as big an issue here).

The extras are terrific as with other BBC shows released by Warner. There are commentary tracks by cast and crew in for every episode of the series. We also get outtakes, a variety of featurettes on each disc on various episodes and, as with ""Doctor Who"", we get the weekly edited version of ""Torchwood: Unclassified"" that runs around two hours on the last disc.

""Torchwood"" is a good series that hasn't completely found it's way yet. Once the series begins to find a better balance between its brand of ""adult"" sex and violence (as well as language)with the science fiction, supernatural elements AND character development, ""Torchwood"" will really be something. Here's hoping season two improves on season one as the inexperience of some of the writers in working within the genre shows.",1201305600,61,4696,4.755828220858896

The characters - from Gwen to Cap'n Jack - are so unreliable and so obsessed with falling in love or bedding one another (or regretting falling in love and/or bedding one another) that the entire series would only be believable if it was set in a small town coffee shop and its characters were over-stimulated 20somethings with nothing other to do than lie (either about themselves or with their co-workers).

As for the alien threats, you have to stick around for the majority of the series until you hit an episode with a fear-inspiring foe and an emotionally-packed ride.",1200355200,14,677,4.769230769230769

And Doctor Who rocks big time.  I grew up with Doctor Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf and other British fare so it's great to see this type of show.

Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it for what it is.  Yup there are a few holes in the first season, all the series and movies have them but I love the series and all the characters, the aliens, the interpersonal relationships - looking forward to Season 2.",1199318400,5,913,4.469879518072289
3191410,4,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is a great sci-fi show for adults.

I give it 4 stars because it is a spin-off; like most spin-offs, I think it still needs a little time to find its ""place.""

**Minor spoilers may be scattered through the rest of the review.**

Some of the episodes probably make more sense if you also watch Dr. Who. But it isn't essential to have watched the Cybermen try to take over in Dr. Who in order to understand that Ianto's girlfriend barely survived when aliens tried to turn her into a robot. In fact, considering some of the poor reviews, it may be better if you did not know much about Dr. Who.

One complaint I read, if I remember correctly, complained that Captain Jack was not as light-hearted as he was in Dr. Who. But Torchwood's Jack is a much different person than the Captain Jack in the first 2 seasons of Dr. Who. Torchwood's Jack has been stuck on Earth for over 100 years... making friends, falling in love, only to watch them grow old and/or die. That's enough to make anyone cynical.

Most of the complaints posted center around the sex in the show. It is definately an adult show! I think there are times that the sex detracts from the episode, but other times it adds a subtle nuance to the scene. But, since season 1 is only 13 episodes, I have hope that this will improve.

What I find funny- Torchwood is a ""secret facility"", a ""covert operation."" Yet they have Torchwood spraypainted on the wall of their hidden base, drive around in big SUVs with Torchwood painted on the sides and the top of the vehicle, and Owen routinely orders pizza using the name Torchwood! I guess there's secret and then there's secret.

All in all, Torchwood is a great show. I would recommend it to any adult fan of science fiction.",1198800000,8,1738,4.446540880503145
3191411,1,B000VWE5OY,"First off let me say I'm a huge Scifi fan and I have all (that are available) the Doctor Who episodes on VCR or DVD. I actually cried when Tom Baker regenerated into Peter Davison. But all the characters on Torchwood need to die in the Season 2 opener and a new crew needs to take over. During the course of the first season I went from looking forward to each show to hoping one of the main characters fell into an abyss. The only one worth saving is Jack (of course he can't die anyway). The rest of them needs to go. The acting was pitiful and at some point you need to care about what happens to the characters in order to want to watch it every week. I can put up with weak plots and terrible storylines (the 1st season had both), but I have to care about the characters. Please BBC, Torchwood is a great idea but throw the current cast into a pit full of Cybermen and Daleks and start from scratch.",1198800000,26,904,4.112994350282486
3191412,2,B000VWE5OY,"I don't quite know what this show was aiming for. I think an Adult oriented show for people that liked Doctor Who and over the age of 18.
Sure, Captain Jack was there but he was not the fun rogue that he was on Doctor Who but a drull leader of a group called Torchwood. Pretty much everyone was so serious that they weren't engaging enough to hold your interest and the chemistry and writing were not there to suck you in and make it a real guilty pleasure.
The Producers idea of being an adult show seemed to be throwing a sex scene in every so often for titilation purposes. Sex is fine but only when the story really calls for it and it makes sense for other reasons that  just being there to be there.
The last three episodes of the season did improve a bit and am hoping they continue with the writing similar to these last few episodes. One can only hope they lighten up a bit.",1198454400,16,883,4.16374269005848

I especially enjoyed Year One, Episode # 12 (of 13): ""Captain Jack Harkness"" where Jack meets the original Capt. Jack, and ""falls"" for him. Their mutual lonliness, need and attraction culminates in one of the most tender, warm and loving scenes ever seen on American television.

I love the way that they have taken the time to develop each character showing both their strengths and flaws.  The season finale actually made me tear up a little when everyone reacted to seeing Jack.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars...ONLY reason, is that it relies so heavily on Dr. Who to get the full gist of what is going on.  I found myself searching Wikipedia and fan sites trying to figure out what the deal was with the hand in the jar...and some other quirks.  I have, however, ordered the three ""modern"" seasons of Dr. Who...in an effort to catch up before Season two starts...I would recommend it for real Sci-fi fans, and maybe not just for casual viewers and prudes.",1197504000,4,792,4.4206896551724135

Too dependent on having seen all the episodes of Doctor Who in which the lead character Jack appears, as well as random monsters, unexplained ""voids"", and time rifts. Add to that the fact that there's apparently a whole library of books about Torchwood and you get a big jumble of characters and events jumping centuries as well as out of sequence.

The writing in the first series wasn't always consistent, and at times, the special effects were very reminiscent of 1970's Dr. Who.  The characters make Torchwood so good---and carry it brilliantly, especially when they've been given something meaty to work with.  John Barrowman is totally believable as Captain Jack.  (Can he be typecast if I've never been aware of him before?  I will have a difficult time accepting him in any other role!) I could watch Eve Myles forever.  Her performance crying while eating pizza made me laugh AND cry.  Her performance in the last episode was even better.  It took me a little longer to warm up to Burn Gorman's character, but that changed when he fell in love.  His character is still terribly flawed, but understandable.  Poor Ianto and Tosh need more airtime---something that's supposed to happen in Season 2.  My only warning is that this is written for adults and older teenagers.

The characters are uninteresting and the acting isn't that great. I'm surprised that this show hasn't been cancelled. Save your money.",1195776000,20,395,4.577464788732394
3191420,5,B000VWE5OY,"The problem with the US and the UK is that we still have different mindsets -- from current events to physical and emotional displays.  Torchwood is one of the most daring shows I've seen to date.  The storylines show innovation and feeling; no character's gender or personal attraction is singled out because of whom they interact with, whether physical or not.  The Torchwood staff is unique team of real people who happen to have the means to protect the planet.

While it was marketed as a spin-off from the [incredible] new Doctor Who series, this first season of Torchwood has certainly proven itself on its own with original characters realistically created.  The show depicts a world in which exists newfound frivolity and homosexuality to losing new interests and old loved ones.  Now that's real life, folks...why have we still not gotten used to it?",1195516800,15,860,4.9375
3191421,4,B000VWE5OY,"I discovered this show watching BBC America, and it seemed worth a try. After several enjoyable but not exactly strong episodes, I thought, this isn't so bad. Then the series started to gain momentum as the season progressed. The episode about fairies was beautifully done, and ""Out of Time,"" about a plane from 1953 landing in the present and the havoc it wreaks on people's lives, was the best of the season (haven't seen the rest of the season yet but am looking forward to it). That episode contained the pathos, heart and meaning of a good novel, not something you'll usually find on television. SPOILER ALERT: When one of the passengers desperately tries to find his son, only to find him an Alzheimer's victim in a rest home, it's devastating to watch. The character Gwen brings a humanity to what has been a chilly group, and the mystery behind who Captain Jack is adds some punch to the show. Just recently found out how Torchwood is a spin-off, essentially, of Doctor Who (even the title is an anagram of ""Doctor Who""), so I guess I'll have to start catching up on the new ""Doctors"" to get even more insight to Torchwood.

This is a good and sometimes very good show that can't really be pigeonholed. It has supernatural elements to it, but the heart of the show is its characters. The writers should be commended, because these are very multi-dimensional characters with lots of layers.",1194998400,4,1397,4.678861788617886

  Twisted and dark, with just enough throw-away lines for Doctor Who fans to giggle and/or sniffle at (""The right kind of Doctor.""), its great for any sci-fi fan.
  As a side note, this is NOT for early teens. Theres, among other things, a openness about sexuality ( one episode sees Jack falling in love with the man whose name he took for a 1940s con). So I only recommend this for people who won't squick over Jack's sexuality or the sometimea randy humor you can get away with on BBC.",1194912000,7,714,4.5984251968503935
3191423,4,B000VWE5OY,"Four stars for the fact that I'm still watching. It's currently mid-way through its US run on BBC America.

I have to say I was really excited about Torchwood when I heard it was going to be shown in the US. I fell in love with the character of Captain Jack on Doctor Who and I think Russell T. Davies has done an absolutely phenomenal job in resurrecting the Doctor, so I was expecting more of the same greatness. But the first episode was quite a jolt - and not necessarily in a good way; but I haven't tuned out in the hopes the episodes would get better - and there have been a couple that I did enjoy quite a bit - ""They Keep Killing Suzie"" is a particular favorite. I really appreciated the subject matter as death and whether or not there is an afterlife is a question I ponder often. Their answer to it in this episode is more than a little chilling.

My one complaint with the series is the sex. Now, I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination and I do believe that when well placed, sex can add to and enhance the story. But some of the instances in Torchwood are truly cringe-worthy and actually detract from the story. Take ""Cyberwoman"" for example. Who is gonna sit there and make out when you're being hunted by a killing machine? There are other instances throughout the series that have left me scratching my head, wondering, ""what was the point of that?""

That's my major beef with it; however, I haven't turned off the telly yet and I have seen some improvement as the series progresses. And to be quite honest, there's a zinger at the end of Doctor Who: Series Three that will probably compel me to tune into Torchwood: Series Two.

I think Torchwood is a bit different (and better) than most American sci-fi shows. It has very interesting and unique storylines, awesome graphics and special effects (especially nice to watch in High Definition), and all of the characters are great! The ONLY bad thing, in my opinion, is that there are so few episodes per season. Don't intend to watch it with your family though because it is not for kids, but for adults who want to see an awesome sci-fi show that's a little on the dark side with a some sexiness mixed in, and a few funny scenes here and there, I definitely recommend watching/buying Torchwood.",1194220800,9,816,4.446666666666666

3191426,5,B000VWE5OY,"Torchwood is the most-times dark, sometimes gory, adult tie-in to the new Doctor Who series, but that hardly matters as it is the most unique TV you'll ever see. ..Dr. Who producer & two-time Hugo-nominated writer Russell T. Davies created the series as an opportunity to do more than just family fare, part CSI, part X-files and the remaining part is out there on its own.  In Dr. Who there have been hidden references to the ""secret"" organization TORCHWOOD (the name which is an anagram of DOCTOR WHO) since season one (an answer given by the ANNE DROID in BAD WOLF episode 12 ), then appearing more physically throughout season two, even featuring the origin of the organization created by  Queen Victorian herself to defend the Earth from alien threats, including The Doctor.  The series takes place over a hundred years later as Jack says on the promos, ""In the 21st century, everything changes."" Captain Jack Harkness (played BRILLIANTLY by the dashing John Barrowman, best known to Americans as the singing Nazi lead in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number in the Producers musical) is a character introduced during season one of Dr. Who, an ex-time agent, con-man, the Doctor & Rose meet in the 1940's and turn towards the path of good and righteousness, well almost.

Jack is originally from the 51st century, which is intended to explain his oversexed ways (i.e. he is very liberal in who he ""SNOGS""& ""SHAGS"" ) His background is really complex, even before he meets the Doctor, but he is missing some of his memories from his time as a time-agent, during the ""Parting of the Ways"" the first season finale of Dr. Who his character becomes even more interesting, but I won't say more without spoiler warnings.

I know I've referenced Dr. Who, a lot, but WATCHING DR. WHO IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR ENJOYING TORCHWOOD, MERELY A BONUS. There is a level to Torchwood that is directed at DW fans, but it isn't obtrusive.  The initial season of Torchwood begins introducing the viewer to its world through the eyes of Gwen, a low-rung Cardiff lady cop, eventually becomes part of a jaded almost amoral group that uses scavenged alien-tech to protect the world from future threats. The neophyte member eventually serves as catalysis to re-humanize the team. But the dynamic of the characters is one of abrasiveness, deceit, love and lust. The major players are far from perfect, by the end of the season, most of the team have done things both unexpected and at times alarming.
Most of the performances are great to watch, much Americanized, gritty acting. Gwen, played by Eve Myles, who oddly enough played a Victorian servant girl named Gwyneth who opens the closes the very rift Torchwood is build on in Dr. Who season 1. Gwen is an earthy attractive but not unrealistically so, as are most of the players, except Jack, of course, who is over-the-top silver-screen good looking, which is perfect for his over-the-top fearless-leader-with-a-mysterious-past archetype.

Torchwood is very stylish, lots of aerial shots of building in Cardiff, the Welsh city where the series is filmed and most of the action takes place.  Its waterside features remind me of New Orleans.  Another anchor location of the show in Cardiff is soooo appropriately the Roald Dahl Plaza (Carciff-born creator of Willy Wonka) it would naturally hold a time-space rift and the headquarters of a secret organization under the fountain where it can monitor extra-terrestrial traffic through the rift. Kind of a sexed up Men in Black, except no one wears black,  well ok Iantos does, but he's more of a case manager type. The series music co-composed by Dr. Who's Murray Gold is both edgy and original. As is the special effects and make-up. In the pilot episode, the make-up on the Weevil, a reoccurring species, is so good that a long scene is shot in full-light with Gwen and another character studying the creature. That is how confident and bold the makers of Torchwood are! The series won a BEST DRAMA SERIES BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts), besting Doctor Who season 2 in the category and  first episodes gave BBC 3 its highest ratings ever.  One series flaw is that Torchwood is meant to be very covert, but they also seem to be high profile ""special ops,"" other than that amusing conflict, I love the series and think that many Americans who may have never watched any British TV before, will be hooked!

The episode guide that follows may have some MINOR SPOILERS, okay?

#1 ""Everything Changes""

 This is a good one, I give it 9 out of 10,  it is one of the best series pilots I've seen. Unlike some series openers, it seems familiar with characters and where they are going, there's no early season one awkwardness here,  INFACT, Eve Myles WON a ""BEST-ACTRESS"" BAFTA (Wales) for this one, John Barrowman got a nom...

Episode Synopsis:

South Wales coffee makin' cop Gwen Cooper is at the scene of a murder when Torchwood shows,  Gwen snoops on the group and sees in a disturbing scene in which the victim is temporally resurrected, then  questioned. She starts her own investigation to learn more, and ends up meeting an alien and literally going underground unsuccessfully disguised as a pizza-girl, joins up and then things get weird....

#2 Day One

This one is less good, but is all about the fact that Torchwood is an adult series and begins to set some boundaries. Even so, this one has a great pre-titles scene with Gwen & her boyfriend, and a great opening line...7 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

The title says it all...it is Gwen's first day on the job, and because of her obligatory noob screw up she unwittingly unleashes a hot-sex-addicted-alien....no REALLY...this  one is about AN ALIEN WHO SHAGS HER WAY THROUGH THE EPISODE...it seems like a Captain Jack natural. There are some great moments and some great lude dialogue, like following the discovery of the alien's nature and the disintegrated remains of its first partner, Harkness remarks that the guy ""came and went, at the same time."" More lines like that and hot-girl-on-alien action...

#3 Ghost Machine

This one is spooky and provides some insights into the gruff team member Owen's character.  Usually, so far, Owen, played by Burn Gorman, isn't the sort to get involved or outwardly show his real feelings, in the series thus far, he has deflected them and given Gwen and the others attitude to cover.  This time, due to his unique interaction with the machine, he is very open and driven.... 8 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

The team retrieve an alien artifact that shows ghost images of the past, thus allowing Owen to witnesses a girl's murder some forty years before. He becomes obsessed with bring the murderer to justice, while Gwen tries to stop future projections from occurring as well.

#4 Cyberwoman

This one may be too much for the Dr. Who fans, but you need not know the back-story to appreciate the story, but it helps to forgive the nature of the story that seems awkward when compared to the rest of the season. The Cybermen, humans converted from a parallel Earth, were all meant to be destroyed at another Torchwood base on this Earth, this is the exception. This time a half converted erotic-cyborg with more gruesome conversion effects and other creepiness, oh and Cyberwoman vs. the pterodactyl...did I mention they have a pterodactyl in the Torchwood HQ...7.5 out of 10 for this one...

Episode Synopsis:

Ianto, played by Gareth David-Lloyd who is sort of the teams Alfred the Butler, managing the Batcave,  has hidden what's left of his girlfriend  at Torchwood. His plans to get outside help end with the entire team at risk of finding themselves converted or worse!

#5 Small Worlds

This one is creepy, if a little predictable, take something inherently cute and friendly, like say fairies, and make them dangerous, powerful and a little homicidal, throw in a spooky little girl, an old girl friend of Jack's er... Dad...and you have a winning mix,  8.5 out of 10 for this one....

Episode Synopsis:

Jack's senior friend has discovered fairies in a nearby wood, while Torchwood uncovers a mysterious jail death and weird weather bursts. Jack sees a pattern connected to his mysterious past....
#6 Countrycide
This one is grisly, edgy and very frightening, playing-out like a mainstream horror movie, a good one!  This one isn't for the squeamish.  ...9 out of 10 for Countrycide...

Episode Synopsis:

Deaths in the middle of nowhere split up the team, Gwen and Owen find themselves in another tight situation, a survivor hides from the killer, Tech-chick Tosh and Ianto race against the clock, and the team fight to stay off the menu.

#7 Greeks Bearing Gifts

This one isn't the best of the season, but it does give more development to Tosh's character...6.5 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Tosh gets a strange pendant from a strange woman and she gains the strange ability to read  minds. In the process learning way more than just casual thoughts, in order to make things right Tosh must get this woman into Torchwood H.Q.

#8 They keep killing Suzie

This is a great one...disturbing and well written, a fallen Torchwood member returns providing a unique opportunity to deal with the consequences of events in the pilot episode. A great exploration of Gwen and her place in Torchwood... I give it 9.5 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

The ""Resurrection-Gauntlet"" was classified as too dangerous to continue experimenting with, but a link to pre-pilot events, force the team to use the gauntlet on a deceased Torchwood member. The process goes wrong  and events go from bad to worse

#9 Random Shoes

Another surprisingly good story, most of the regular team is sideline for much of this one as it's point of view is from a deceased peripheral character, like Dr. Who's B team stories (used for shooting two shows simultaneously ), it brilliantly features an outsider's view of the team, more outside than even Gwen's episode one intro...9 out of 10...the end is a bit sappy...

Episode Synopsis:

Eugene Jones learns that he has been the victim of a hit-and-run and is dead. He retracing his ""steps""  leading up to his death, including his interaction with the Torchwood team and what he believed was an alien artifact,  while Gwen is the unwitting partner in the same investigation.

#10 Out of Time

This one is a weak one, ""the fish out of water/ romance that can never be,""  great pre-title opening with the Team on hand as a temporally -displaced plane touches down on an airstrip, mostly-predictable and unnecessarily sappy...7 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Three stangers from the early 50's are trapped in present-day Cardiff, after flying from the Rift. Torchwood helps each of the them deal with making a new life, one way or another and Owen gets serious with one.

#11 Combat

This one is written by Noel Clarke a.k.a Mickey Smith, really.  You've asked for it, you got it! The Weevil Fight Club!  This one is pretty good, what it lacks in originality it makes up for in style and intensity...9 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

Weevils continue to come from the rift surfacing across Cardiff, but where are they disappearing to? Owen goes undercover to find out.

#12 Captain Jack Harkness

Warning this one is not for the homophobic; Jack is particularly randy in this one. There's loads of drama and amazing acting in this one,  although a visually limited view of the WWII era, the character of Bilis Manger, mysterious time-walker, is fascinating to watch as he manipulates the staff in this episode and the next, played by Murray Melvin (who could play William Hartnell if they every need him). .. 9.5 out of 10

Episode Synopsis:

Jack and Tosh are transported to the 1940s, during the Blitz where they meet another Captain Jack Harkness and it isn't Jack. The rest of the team go in search of decades old clues Jack and Tosh may have left.
( Watch for the ""Vote Saxon"" posters in this one. A Dr. Who series 3 ref.)

#13 End of Days

Tightly following the events in the last episode, all hell breaks loose, literally as the mysterious Mr. Bilis plans for the Rift continue with it wide enough to release the deity he worships. This one has its roots in H.P. Lovecraft's work, ...10 out of 10...

Episode Synopsis:

People from thoughout history come through the rift into the present across the world.  Jack learns he is the only thing standing between the world and the ""Son the Beast"". Jack is put in a position where he may have to sacrifice it all to save everyone. (This one connects directly to the final 3 episodes of Dr. Who season 3.)

TORCHWOOD, a spinoff of DOCTOR WHO, is yet another television show with nifty science-fiction and paranormal elements, and it IS a marvelous and fun show. The premise: the Torchwood Institute is a covert organization given the responsibility of being Great Britain's watchdog against all things malicious and extraterrestrial. This series revolves around the amazing exploits of Torchwood Three, a branch of the Torchwood Institute which operates out of Cardiff, Wales.

In the debut episode ""Everything Changes,"" Policewoman Constable Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) witnesses a deceased stab victim's temporary return to life. This becomes her introduction to a hidden world of frightening monsters, incomprehensible alien technologies, and extreme paranoia. She meets the very charming Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a man displaced in time and leader of Torchwood Three. Oh, and he can't die. He obligingly places Gwen in the loop: ""We don't just catch aliens. We scavenge the stuff they leave behind, find ways of using it, arming the human race against the future."" Fairly soon, after some fairly interesting - not to mention, harrowing - moments, Gwen finds herself recruited as the group's police liaison. And with a spacetime rift located in Wales, she and the other Torchwood members remain up to their necks in weirdness and peril. On a more personal scale, Gwen struggles to maintain a normal relationship with her lived-in boyfriend. It's not easy being Scully.

I happened to stumble onto this dark, moody series on the On Demand's BBC America channel and became speedily hooked. It's done by the Brits and they bring their sensibilities to the table. Its tone, while somewhat reminiscent of the X-FILES, also does remind me a bit of DOCTOR WHO, but that one's to be expected as these two shows are closely linked. In fact, the word ""Torchwood"" is an anagram of Doctor Who and was a security code used by the crew of that series to foil television piracy.

The sci-fi elements naturally loom large. The show immediately immerses the audience in its peculiar and scary universe lurking just behind the veil of normality. Cool and wondrous gadgets and concepts abound: perception filters, invisible lifts, ghost machines, time rifts, resurrection gloves - you know, screwy science-run-amok stuff. The show's contents do tend to stray toward more adult themes, and the casual use of earthy language underscores this. As a reflection of this maturity, the show isn't shy in depicting several of the team members as leaning towards an alternative lifestyle. Captain Jack Harkness himself is bisexual and disarmingly casual about it. In the sexually-charged ""Day One"" the baddie is a snog-happy (wonderful word, ""snog"") space creature who snuffs out its victims at the moment of orgasm (As Jack off-handedly comments regarding one casualty: ""He just...came and went.""). So, no, not for the young 'uns, this show.

There are 13 episodes in the first series, and they are thoughtful and lushly plotted and just as splashy as their American counterparts. The CG is certainly there. The mostly British actors are very good. Gwen Cooper is played by Welsh actress Eve Myles, and Gwen makes for an engaging and ideal point-of-view character. The popular Captain Jack Harkness, last seen in the DOCTOR WHO series, comfortably crosses over into this show and drags actor John Barrowman with him. Barrowman, by the way, is magnetic! The cast of characters is interesting and complex and develops as the series progresses, with team members keeping their share of dark and dangerous secrets. One of them even turns traitor, dies, and comes back from the dead. Needless to say, the group dynamics tend to be volatile.

One negative is that most of the episodes are self-contained, which introduces a certain faltering in overall cohesion and continuity. However, the episodes will still suck you in. The best ones, in my opinion, are ""They Keep Killing Susie"" (Former Torchwood member Susie Costello returns), ""Out of Time"" (great and melancholy episode with three aircraft passengers from 1953 disembarking in the present and forced to acclimate to this brave new world), ""Captain Jack Harkness"" (very good time travel story as Jack and Toshiko journey temporaly to 1941 and meet the real Captain Jack Harkness, whose identity Torchwood's Jack would soon steal), and the exciting season finale ""End of Days"" (Wales' time rift becomes unstable and begins causing disturbing temporal anomalies).

Hmm, the Doctor Who universe seems to be rapidly expanding. First, this riveting Torchwood offshoot and now followed by THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES (longtime Doctor Who-philes will recall investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a popular companion to the 3rd and 4th Doctor). As a fan, I say keep it coming. To the curious out there who somehow haven't yet turned on to a good thing: c'mon, get hip to TORCHWOOD.",1191110400,171,4928,5.206809583858764

I just don't need all that in my entertainment, and I know many feel the same way I do.  I got rid of Netflix because it seemed all of their original content was TV-MA full of stuff that doesn't add to the enjoyment and excludes one's ability to enjoying t.v. with teenagers and friends...
