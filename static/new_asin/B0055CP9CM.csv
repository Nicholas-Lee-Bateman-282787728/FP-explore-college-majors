4573558,5,B0055CP9CM,"First, the WWE gave us Money in the Bank and now SummerSlam. SummerSlam was so much fun to watch that it's worth watching again, I mean from Start to finish the PPV was well booked by the WWE. I truly hope ""Night of Champions"" would be better and all the other PPVs in the future.",1315180800,2,280,4.109090909090909
4573559,4,B0055CP9CM,"Just a couple of notes but the commentary team for the show was Lawler & Cole & Booker, Adam Jones of the rock band ""Tool"" performed the National Anthem on the guitar, and Cee-Lo Green performed the SummerSlam theme ""Bright Light"" along with ""Forget You"" later on during the show.

Rey Mysterio, Kofi Kingston, John Morrison vs. The Miz, Alberto Del Rio, R-Truth - Each member of one team had a personal issue with a member of the other team & even fought in singles matches in the previous weeks leading up to this six man tag.  This was a very fun opening match that was fast paced & full of non-stop action featuring a bunch of high flying from the babyface team while R-Truth pulled out some of his old athletic moves, Alberto sneaking in his shots, and Miz even pulling out a modified face first DDT that looked like it really hurt.

Sheamus vs. Mark Henry - Mark Henry showed that he had the power advantage early by beating on Sheamus followed by tossing him over the top rope & pressing him back into the ring before focusing on his back with a backbreaker & various splashes.  Sheamus tried fighting strength on strength against Henry with a shoulder block from the top rope along with delivering the crow kick that knocked Henry out of the ring but Mark continued to use his strength that including ramming Sheamus into the post on the outside before crashing through the ringside barricade.  This was one of those matches that was solid & kept both men strong as Sheamus brought the fight while Mark was still showcased as strong & dominate.

WWE Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Phoenix - Eve was in Kelly's corner while Beth had Natayla in her corner as they recently re-formed their alliance under the name ""Divas Of Doom.""  Kelly used her athleticism early to get the best of Beth such as a head scissors & a dive off the top onto the floor.  Beth rebounded with her power such a pressing & hanging Kelly on the top rope along with the back breaker with Kelly just refusing to lie down & keep fighting.  By diva match standards, this was nice & the best divas match on PPV in quite sometime.

Daniel Bryan vs. Wade Barrett - As the commentators noted, it was only around a year ago that these men were both rookies on the first season of NXT along with later being members of Nexus while it was last year at SummerSlam that Bryan was the mystery member of Team WWE competing against Barrett's Nexus in the main event.  Bryan worked over Barrett's legs with various stretches & kicks while also pulling out various moves like the missile dropkick & running knee strike off the apron.  Both men traded momentum back & forth against each other  including moments like Bryan delivering a flying clothesline only for Barrett to return it later with a flying forearm.  This was another good match as it was the performance that Barrett has needed after his long running losing streak.

No Holds Barred Match: World Champion Christian vs. Randy Orton - Before the match, we get a special treat as Edge returned to confront Christian about his actions over the previous weeks.  Christian was in control early but tried to run away when Orton regained the advantage only for Orton to chase him into the crowd & dish out punishment there.  The fans had dueling chants as a kendo stick came into play causing Orton to bleed from the mouth before he caught Christian in mid-air with a dropkick.  Orton pulled out & setup tables which Christian was superplexed onto one that was laid out on the ringmat.  They exchanged their signature moves with Orton delivering an RKO though the announce table while Christian delivering a Killswitch in the ring but it was when Christian once again showed the ultimate sign of disrespect that sent Orton's anger into overdrive involving a chair, trash can, table, and the steel steps.  This match ranks right up there with their first two matches in this series as a high quality encounter as Christian was able to pull more out of Orton than most were able to do.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. WWE Champion C.M. Punk w/Triple H as the special referee - Cena was in control right off the bat grounding Punk with various takedowns & headlocks while Punk attempted maneuvers like a body scissors only for Cena to power out & reverse into a side slam.  Both men were being able to counter & reverse each others signature holds like Cena's comeback with shoulderblocks being stopped by Punk's high knee & a series started by a submission attempt by Punk reversed into an STF countered by a keylock & turned into a crossface.  Triple H as a referee didn't really start to play a factor until later on as there was a moment where he took matters into his own hands to make sure the match didn't end in a draw with both men later questioning his count after each hit one of their signature moves only for the other to kick out of it.  They pulled out all the stops here & even did things out of their normal move set like Cena's dropkick & Punk doing a move that got a chant of ""Thank You Savage"" from the crowd.  This was just like their match the previous month where Cena stepped his game up & put on a performance while Punk showcased why he was one of the best in the WWE but stay tuned after the match as we got a few surprise appearances leading to something happening that nobody expected when the match started.

In the end, this event completely craps over the show the previous year as it was a solid show from top to bottom as there wasn't a bad match on here & we got some of the best performances from the talents involved in recent months or even longer so this is a show worth going out of your way to see.",1313712000,,5655,4.471331389698737
4573560,5,B0055CP9CM,"Having to attend my first ever live WWE event, I didn't set any expectations at all.  I attended the Summerslam Axxess on Sunday as well.  It was an overwhelming experience.  To experience the fellow fans chanting Cena and Punk rivalries, to meeting some of the Superstars for autograph and picture signing, to watching live matches in Axxess.  It was a well worth experience.

Now, onto Summerslam itself.  I am not going to layout the game cards and results as it has already been laid out great by the two previous reviewers.  What I would say though is this is one of the greatest Summerslam events ever.  For me, the last two previous ones was somewhat of a let down.  The champion vs. champion match of Cena and Punk reminds me of Hogan vs. Warrior in the 90's where Hogan has to defend his WWE Championship while The Ultimate Warrior has to defend his Intercontintal belt.  I love being part of the live audience and it is definitely worth something to experience.  I am definitely looking forward for the next major PPV event in the LA area as I would like to be a part of it.  Overall, it was a great experience, good matches which will make buying the DVD or Bluray (for me) a must have.",1313366400,,1197,4.465437788018433
4573561,5,B0055CP9CM,"The Bonus 6 man tag team match had nice high-flying action and a great way to start the event. The Mark Henry-Sheamus match was pretty good brawl even with the countout ending. The DIVAs title match was short but sweet. The Wade Barrett-Daniel Bryan match had pretty nice high-tech wrestling and I think it was the sleeper match of the event. The No Holds Barred match for the World's title bewteen Randy Orton-Christain was a knock-out,drag-out,smash-mouth brawl and it was a good reminder of the 1990's ECW. The CM Punk-John Cena-WWE Title match was a back-and-forth,high-tech,enteratining,fun,heart-pounding,action-packed match of the year candidate and it was just as good as thier bout from Money In The Bank show. No comment on Alberto Del Rio cashing his MITB contact after CM Punk's beating from Kevin Nash. I give this event a 10 out of 10.",1313366400,,849,4.985915492957746
4573562,4,B0055CP9CM,"This originally had a terrible card expected to be carried by the No Holds Barred Match for the World Heavyweight Championship. It ended up to not be bad. Some of the matches are NOT rated. WARNING SPOILER ABOUT MONEY IN THE BANK AND WINNER OF PUNK CENA MATCH. Read to the end of the Undisputed Match if you don't want spoilers. I'll keep the rest spoiler free.

1. Six-Man Tag Team Match
Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio and John Morrison vs. Alberto Del Rio, The Miz and R-Truth: (13:38)
This kind of reminds me of the great opener from SummerSlam 1991 between Ricky Steamboat, The British Bulldog and Texas Tornado and the team of Paul Roma, Hercules and The Warlord. That was 20 years ago. This is something that has reflected off of long rivalries on RAW. People were expecting Alex Riley and John Morrison vs. The Miz and R-Truth. Whatever. Good Match. Fast paced and very entertaining. Good teamwork by both sides. High flying and outside action included. What a way to start the show. 8/10

2. Sheamus vs. Mark Henry: (11:22)
I honestly didn't consider this to be a filler. I thought that Mark Henry turning heel and overpowering SmackDown! was a great storyline. Sheamus was the shocking new babyface to try and over power the WSM. Anyway, a good power vs power match. Match should not have ended the way it did but it somewhat made sense. 8/10

3. Divas Championship Match
Kelly Kelly(c) vs. Beth Phoenix: (7:48)
Who cares about Divas Matches.

4. Wade Barrett vs. Daniel Bryan: (11:47)
Stupid rivalry. But very physical match. Wade Barrett is really being forced to whine about the Money in the Bank Ladder Match last month. Barrett should be treated better. He took out his anger out on Bryan in this good match. Bryan put in 2 or 3 different submission holds which made you think it was going to end but it kept going and going.  8.5/10

5. No Holds Barred Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Christian(c) vs. Randy Orton: (23:48)
Christian got huge pop because he cut a promo with his best friend Edge before the match. Christian said that he was going to have Edge in his corner for the match. But Edge said he was a little dissapointed in Christian for hiding behind lawyers and becoming crying, whiny b*tch.

Now onto the match. This had to be the best match of this rivalry. This was extreme, full of weapons and it was brutal. Christian got the upper hand in the beginning of the match. Randy Orton eventually started to punish Christian. At that point Christian tried to escape from the Viper by running through the crowd. Orton caught him and beat him up there. That was when the No Holds Barred rule came into play. I thought it would just be a kendo stick but it was 3 kendo sticks, steel steps, tables broken, little use of a chair and steel trash cans. This match was very back and forth and down the middle. I rate this to be the 2nd at a 9.25/10

6. WWE ""Undisputed"" Championship w/ Triple H as special guest referee
CM Punk(real champ) vs John Cena(not real champ): (26:14)
This match was so good and in my opinion, it could've topped their match @ MITB. This match didn't take 5 whoe minutes for them to actually touch each other like MITB. Since so much stakes were on the line, that was excused. Lets focus on this match. It was back and forth, and all buisness. There were not many bbig moves to hit in this match but their so many little moves showed that their not just finishers. I am truly in favor of the new face CM Punk more than John Cenas new fans hate him phase. It had a lot of detail and a lot of high flying moves. Really great main event. Triple H called it down the middle and made sure that there was going to one WWE Champ. So he threw them into the ring after being outside for 10 seconds instead of counting them out. This match was truly unbelieveable. This match added an extra star to this whole event. Pure 10/10.  Had a really shocking aftermath with the return of ""Diesel"" Kevin Nash attacking the winner. One more thing happened to...

WARNING SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ!
7. WWE Championship Money in the Bank Cash-in Match

CM Punk(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio(Cashing in)
An eight second match which pretty much featured a kick to the face of Punk. 1...2...3 ALBERTOOOOOOO DEL RIOOO IS THE NEW UNDISPUTED WWE CHAMPION. I thought that this was stupid at first but then I thought of how Del Rio had a great match with Daniel Bryan 2 nights before on SmackDown and the other great match he had with Rey Mysterio the next night.

Overall PPV Rating: 8.75/10",1313280000,,4526,4.492700729927007
4573563,5,B0055CP9CM,"Live from Los Angeles its the biggest party of the summer, its the 24th Annual WWE Summerslam and all eyes were on the champion vs. champion main event and the role Triple H would play as the special guest referee and with only three other matches announced its assured we'll have added matches.

-There's a guitar rendition of our national anthem by the guitarist of Tool, Adam Jones (at least I think thats the name). Its not bad but nothing that special honestly.

-A video package is shown, hyping the main event tonight of John Cena vs. CM Punk, good way to hype it.

-The pryo goes off and we are welcomed to L.A.

-Six Man Tag Team Match, The Miz, The Truth & Alberto Del Rio vs. Kofi Kingston, John Morrison & Rey Mysterio: We start off with an appearance by The Miz, as he talks about being at Summerslam, The Truth interrupts and the crowd instantly starts a ""What?"" chant. Alberto Del Rio comes out, the crowd cheers big for him. The faces make their entrances and we have our opening match. Its good fast paced action, with Morrison and Truth getting into it and Truth targets John's neck. Kofi gets the tag and takes it to Miz hitting a nice springboard splash. Del Rio prevents a pinfall and kicks Rey off the apron. Kofi hits Miz with a stomp and tag Rey who takes it to all three men. After Kofi and Morrison hit splashes to the outside, Rey hits a splash off the top and pins Truth to win the match. 8/10. Hot opening match.

-Backstage John Laurenitis demands an apology from CM Punk for his actions on Raw. He jokingly apologizes and Stephanie of all people makes an appearance and wishes Punk luck. Stephanie even offers a handshake, but Punk says ""I know where that hands been"". Great line to end the segment by Punk.

-Sheamus vs. Mark Henry: After Henry had taken out Kane, The Big Show and Koslov it appeared no one would face The World's Strongest Man. Enter Sheamus who had said on Smackdown he wasn't afraid of Henry. Sheamus gets a good reaction, while Henry doesn't get much of one. Sheamus had to use a lot of force to down the bigger Henry, while Mark shows his strength edge knocking down Sheamus but he can't keep him down. Mark just wears down his opponent, but misses a vader bomb off of the top rope. Sheamus just keeps hammering Henry til he knocks him down, he does also hit a nice shoulder block from the top rope. On the outside Henry slams Sheamus into the ring post then runs him through the barricade, much to the crowds shock. Sheamus can't get back to the ring in time and is counted out. 8/10. Good hard hitting match.

-Christian is backstage and says Randy Orton is over matched in their No Holds Barred Match tonight.

-We now have a live performance by Cee Lo Green singing the Summerslam theme song, ""Bright Lights, Bigger City"" and another one of his singles. Its not very good honestly, the crowd doesn't seem to care all that much and a few of the divas are brought out to spice up interest, it doesn't work. When you see this on DVD (if this is on there) its best to skip it. Its however not as bad as Kid Rock's performance at Wrestlemania 25.

-Divas Championship Match, Kelly Kelly (Champion) w/Eve vs. Beth Phoenix w/Natalya: Kelly uses her quickness to take it to Beth and she does initially dominate. Michael Cole even comments on Kelly's outfit calling a move the ""Flying Candy Cane"", King says he has a response but can't say it on the air (kinda funny and gross). Beth locks on a nice overhead submission but Kelly doesn't tap. The crowd seems to be behind Beth more than Kelly and while Beth tries she just can't seem to keep Kelly down. Kelly reverses the Glam Slam and rolls up Beth for the win to retain her title. 6/10.

-We see Stephanie walking out a locker room and it turns out to be John Cena's room.

-R-Truth is talking to someone and it turns out to be hall of famer Jimmy Hart, who talks about wanting to manage R-Truth, who starts to agree but of course comes to the conclusion that Jimmy Hart is little Jimmy, pretty funny actually.

-Wade Barrett vs. Daniel Bryan: A year ago these two were on opposite teams and now we have a one on one match between the two former Nexus members. Bryan uses his vast submission knowledge to wear down Barrett who tries to use his strength but keeps getting stopped. Bryan gets caught in a sideslam but kicks out and Wade takes over. Barrett does take a nasty header into the barricade, and Bryan comes with a flying knee off the ring apron. Bryan hits some vicious kicks that sound painful, but Wade kicks out. Barrett manages to escape the LaBell Lock and he hits a huge clothesline off the top rope. Wade hits Wasteland and covers Bryan for the win. 10/10. Great match.

-No Holds Barred Match For The World Heavyweight Championship, Christian (Champion) vs. Randy Orton: This has been quite a long standing rivalry that started all the way back in May, and after 3 PPV face offs we have this match. Christian comes out and says the suprise he had up his sleeve was none other than his best friend Edge, who gets a huge reaction from the crowd. Edge talks up Christian and it turns into him pointing out that Christian's tactics made him a disgrace and that his best friend had become a whiny, little.... (well you get it), and Edge walks off. So now its one on one and early on Orton stomps and wears down Christian. Orton goes shoulder first into the ring post and the crowd seemed to be cheering for Christian a good amount. Christian nails Orton with a kendo stick a few times and even tries choking out Randy with the stick. Orton hits a huge superplex onto a flattened table, later Christian goes for an RKO but Orton counters into one of his own slamming both through the announce table. Back in the ring Christian hits the Killswitch but it was only a 2 count. Christian ends up going through a table on the outside and Randy brings numerous weapons into the ring. Orton hits an RKO on the steel steps in the ring and covers to win the World Title. One word: Wow. 11/10.

-Champion vs. Champion, CM Punk (WWE Champion) vs. John Cena (WWE Champion) Special Referee: Triple H: After the Match of the Year they had at Money In The Bank PPV we have this champion vs. champion match. The crowd goes nuts for CM Punk when he comes out and expected Cena gets a massive chorus of boos. Once the bell rings the crowd cheers Punk loudly, initially drowning out the Cena fans. Throughout this match it was debated by the announcers what Triple H would do and there was plenty of tension without being over the top. Punk uses his submission style to wear down the bigger Cena and of course Cena hits his stereo-typical offense. The back and forth action here is a lot like their MITB match, Punk counters Cena's offense and even locks on a unique submission move but Cena reverses it and gets an STF on Punk, but Punk locks on the Anaconda Vice. After a dive to the outside knocks out both men, Triple H counts to 9 then goes outside and throws both men back in. After a dueling exchange Cena hits a dropkick and goes for the AA, but gets rolled up for 2. Tons more back and forth action, Punk doesn't tap to the STF and he kicks out of the AA. Punk goes for a Macho Man style elbow but only gets 2, which gets a big Randy Savage chant from the crowd. Punk hits a second GTS goes for the cover and gets the win even though Cena's foot was on the rope. Your Undisputed WWE Champion, CM Punk. 11/10. Afterwards Triple H raises Punk's hand which Punk seems stunned by.

-Shockingly Kevin Nash hits the ring and Jacknife Powerbombs Punk, which had the crowd going nuts. Alberto Del Rio comes down, cashes in his MITB contract, hits a kick to Punks head and makes the cover and now Del Rio is the Undisputed Champion.

What a Summerslam, the first great one in years. The main events are well worth watching and even the divas match wasn't bad. Worth catching the replay and getting on DVD when its out.",1313280000,2,7912,4.39412568306011

4573595,4,B0055CP9CM,"Tag Team Champions Air Boom vs Ziggler & Swagger (with Vickie Guerrero: Pretty good opener despite having to hear Guerrero at ringside. Actually the only bad part to the entire match was listening to the god awful commentating team of Cole, Lawler, & Booker T.

US Champion Dolph Ziggler VS Zach Ryder: Yup, Ziggler is in the opener then shoved right into the next match. Nothing really speical here.

Diva's Champion Beth Phoenix VS Eve Torres: Skip

Sheamus VS Christian: Nothing against either man & I love Christian, but this match has been played out so many times. I remember before injury how Sheamus was stuffed down on our throats with him wrestling on every show WWE had.

Triple H & CM Punk VS Awesome Truth: Can't remember the story behind the match but it's a decent one. Kevin Nash returns in the end to attack Triple H while Awesome Truth hit CM Punk with a cool finisher to end it.

Randy Borton VS Cody Rhodes: Just like most of the matches on the card, it's good but you can see it for free on TV at the time of the event or hell even a few years down the road.

World Champion Mark Henry VS Big Show: These two big men can go & this was a pretty good match with the ring breaking in the end. They stopped the match & acted like both men were dead.

WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio VS John Cena: I hate Del Rio with a passion, a product of being rushed down WWE's fans throats to fast. Cena can always go in a hardcore match & this match is no expection. If the ring was still in use then this may have been another title match but without the ring, it makes it pretty fun to watch. Cena puts his best effort foward as he almost captures the belt but Awesome Truth interfere to cost him the match.

Overall, with Raw being 3 hours, Main Event on Wenesdays, & Smackdowns on Fridays, PPV's have just lost an edge for me. I watched this event 3 years after the fact & it's just like eh, seen it before on free tv so many times. Again, good event but just like watching it on free TV. God awful commentary by the way as Cole is still in heel mode & Booker T cannot do commentary for the life of him while Lawler just goes thru the motions.",1390608000,2,2150,4.188861985472155

The show starts with an awful version of the national anthem by some tool from a band of the same name. My ears almost started bleeding, but don't worry, it's over soon enough. What follows is a pretty good video package, and some quality matches all throughout the night.

I will not spoil the results of the matches, just a few thoughts and a score.

1. Rey Mysterio, John Morrison & Kofi Kingston Vs. Miz, R-Truth & Alberto Del Rio

Wowsers, what an opener! First Miz comes out and....well...does his shtick, followed by R-truth to bring on the crazyness with an apparent vocabulary lesson, until Del rio comes and out and they shut up because...well...he's rich. That means he's dangerous. Then the other team comes out and the match starts. There is some awesome work, and wonderful high-flying parts that made for an action-packed, hard-hitting opening match, albeit with a somewhat confusing intro. 3.5/5

2. Mark Henry Vs. Sheamus

Another good match. I really liked the pace of this match, as even though it was a slower match, it was still hard hitting and would pick up the pace at certain spots. Both men worked hard to put on a good show, and their work speaks a ton in this match. Also the ending is quite the sight, and was really well done for making both men look good. The only thing I didn't like were some of the plants at ringside WAY-overreacted near the ending, but is was fun to see one them get launched a few rows back! 3/5

Cee Lo Green comes out and sings songs, songs that I recommend skipping.

3. WWE Divas Championship Match: Champion Kelly Kelly Vs. Beth Phoenix

I'll admit it, I was at last years summer slam, and this was my bathroom break. I might have enjoyed the match live, but after watching on DVD, the end ruins the whole match. I'm glad I took that time to use the potty and get some munch and drink. 2.5/5 the only not good match here, could've been good, but the ending screwed it up

4. Daniel Bryan Vs. Wade Barrett

Man, this one is a barn-burner right here. Great match from beginning to end. Truly deserving of the high spot on the card with great chemistry between the two in the ring. I don't want to give away too much, great moves and counters, and nice shocker of an ending made me stand up even though the winner was not who I expected or wanted. Really good semi main event, that I could see being a future Main Event. 4/5

5. Co-Main Event of The Night: No Holds Barred Match For The World Championship
World Champion Christian Vs. ""The Viper"" Randy Orton

The first of two absolutely fabulous main events here, and it's a hell-raising slobber-knocker from beginning to end. From the pre-match segment featuring a recent Hall of Fame Inductee, to both men playing their roles perfectly, this match is great all the way through. These two have amazing chemistry in that ring, and it really shows here. Great use of weapons, and even a bloody-finger makes an appearance. These men had meet a lot by this time, and this is the best of all their encounters thus far. A violent masterpiece, and a must-see match 5/5

6. Co-Main Event of The Night: WWE Undisputed Championship Unification Match
WWE Champion John Cena Vs. WWE Champion CM Punk
W/Special Ref. Triple H

The impossible happens, as Cena and Punk have a match that's even better than their last meeting at Money in The Bank. This here is a wonderful wrestling match with the only downside being the finishing 3 count, but in the end, the shock of what would follow just made it even better. Just a great match, a grand-class in mat-story-telling, as they say. And all of this leads to a shocking end that left me breathless at the time. Go out of your way to watch this 5/5

Overall, this event was amazing, especially live and after ordering the 2010 edition the year before on pay-per-view. This 2011 edition blows 2010 and even this years, out of the water. I recommend to Wrestling fans who want to see a part of WWE's version of ""The Summer of Punk"".",1345852800,,4211,4.492146596858639

4573608,5,B0055CP9CM,"This was another good PPV from the WWE that featured some of the best matches seen all year.  The opening match was a 6 man tag with Rey Mysterio, John Morrison and Kofi Kingston taking on Alberto del Rio, The Miz and R-Truth.  This was treated as a almost forgotten match with guys who weren't even supposed to be on the show.  I really thought that because of the way they were playing that angle that all 6 men would come out and put on a hell of match but they really didn't.  It was good but just didn't have that wow factor that you look for.  Up next was Sheamus vs Mark Henry.  Some people that I know hated this match but I thought it was pretty good.  There was a lot of high impact moves and the ending with Henry slamming Sheamus through the barricade at ringside was just fantastic.  Still don't understand this whole push for Henry (maybe it's a prize for him putting in over 15 years of service, I don't know).  The next match was Kelly Kelly taking on Beth Pheonix for the Diva's title.  This match was really good and we actually get to see a side of Kelly that we really never see and that s the angry side of her.  Other then that this match was just your standard Divas match (oh how I long for better womens matches).  I'll be honest if the next match would have maybe ran for 20 plus minutes it may have been the match of the night.  Daniel Bryan and Wade Barrett put on a hell of a contest for over 12 mins.  I really thought that because Bryan just won the MitB ladder match I thought they would keep him strong but again I was wrong as Barrett beats Bryan and actually makes himself look stronger even though he's not really a contender for the world title at this point and Bryan is.  I just don't understand why the WWE treats Bryan like a weakling.  They really need to watch him ROH or Japan because Bryan has taken on and beaten the best in the world.  Hopefully they'll wake up soon.  Up next was the No Holds Barred match for the world heavyweight title between Christian and Randy Orton.  Hard hitting match from start to finish.  This match was freaking good and maybe the best that they had in their feud.  They used everything from tables to chairs to kendo sticks to the steel steps, nothing was left untouched.  When it was over Orton was champion again for the 9th time and I was happy.  The main event was for the Undisputed WWE championship as John Cena who just recently won the title was taking on CM Punk who claimed he was the real champion and was returning to prove it.  Triple H who was the COO wanted to be sure this one was called down the middle and so he named himself special referee.  Many didn't think this match would live up to the MitB match they had and it didn't but it was still a very very good match.  It wasn't as long as their previous match but it still had a lot of back and forth action and a lot of near falls.  Punk would beat Cena again (I can't really remember the last time Cena lost at 2 back to back PPV's) and the crowd was once again primed and excited to see this.  After that the card gets kind of weird as Kevin Nash comes back and powerbombs Punk and then del Rio comes out to cash in his MitB and beat Punk to now become the champion.  I do feel this is bad booking as Punk is the most popular superstar you have and you should try to keep the title on Punk for a while and keep the fans just wondering when del Rio is going to cash in.  I think the WWE moved too fast on this but it was still a great show from top to bottom and in my opinion one of the best Summerslams in recent memory, definatly better then last year.  Great matches and another great PPV.",1322611200,,3642,4.130681818181818
4573609,4,B0055CP9CM,This was a pretty good PPV. Of course the big deal about this PPV was the CM Punk vs. Triple H match. It was an awesome match as expected. Another big deal about that night was after 15 long years Mark Henry finally wins his first World Heavyweight Title. Also was a great match between John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio. John Cena puts on some good matches when he wants to. It had a pretty good undercard on it too. With matches like a fatal 4 way match for the US title. And Cody Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase for the IC Championship. Also Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly and Air Boom vs. Awesome Truth. Special features include the contract signing for the match between CM Punk vs. Triple H. All in all a great PPV and for the price it's not bad to own a night of WWE history.,1322006400,,767,4.12

VENGEANCE 2011

Ah yes the event that came to us live from San Antonio Texas baby, and then the next night Raw came from my town of Austin baby. Both were great by the way but any way back to this. This event was a good one that did not have a disappointing match in my opinion. I am reviewing the DVD and also this was the first Vengeance event since like 2007 or something.

1.[TAG TEAM TITLE]AIR BOOM VS DOLPH ZIGGLER & JACK SWAGGER-excellent opening match as these two teams always seem to put on. Is it just me or is it every time Dolph opens a show his match is one of the best. The action in this one is great with all four bringing their a-games. This match has some great moments and even has a touch of that old school tag action. If only the WWE would learn from these two teams and get serious about the division. Air Boom retains the titles after an excellent opening contest. Plus there was a crazy monkey flip that sent Dolph flying.

2.[US TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ZACH RYDER-immediately following his tag match Dolph has to defend his US title. Much like the first match Dolph is excellent here putting on a great showing against Zach. Dolph gets in trouble a lot in this one and looks to his teammate and manager to help him out. He ends up keeping the title in another good match.

3.[DIVA'S TITLE]BETH PHOENIX VS EVE-one of my favorite wrestlers out there Beth does her thing here against Eve. The Diva's division has been getting a bit better this year. Beth and Natalya have always been great and I love that Beth is the champ. This is a good enough match that does its job, not as good as some past ones but still a good match.

4. CHRISTIAN VS SHEAMUS-these two have been going at it for a little bit now and once again they put on a good show. Sheamus uses his strength to his advantage in this match while Christian uses his speed to combat that. Good back and forth action and a really great ending that give Sheamus the win.

5. TRIPLE H, CM PUNK VS THE MIZ, R-TRUTH-the match I was most looking forward to since I love all four of these guys. I knew going in that this was going to be a good match and expected a crazy ending. Turns out I was right on both counts, but to we will get to that. Great back and forth action here with Punk and Triple H actually working well together and even gets in some heel moves. Things are going well for Triple H and Punk when Kevin Nash comes out and lays Triple H out. This lets Truth get back in the ring in time to save Miz and get the win.

6. CODY RHODES VS RANDY ORTON-two guys that have a long history together go at it in this one. This is a really solid match that shows how far Cody has come in the WWE. He gives Randy a run for his money but comes up a little short after an RKO. Still it was a great match with Cody really shining in my opinion.

7.[WORLD TITLE]MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-this was a match that a lot of people doubted for some reason. I liked the storyline going into this and had faith that this would be a good match. This of course was big man vs. big man, power vs. power, and it was good. I think this was a really good match and actually pretty dramatic, even before the ending. Of course they pull a Show/Brock with a superplex that levels the ring and causes the match to stop.

8.[WWE TITLE LAST MAN STANDING MATCH]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS JOHN CENA-this match turned out to be a really good one to no ones surprise. These specialty matches really help Cena and his brawling style. These two battled all though out the place including in the middle of the broken ring. There are all kinds of spots in this so you know the crowd was into it. This was a really good last man standing match full of action, I loved when Del Rio went flying from the ring. That part had me cracking up, still love even now. My boy Del Rio keeps the belt in a hard fought match though, oh and did I mention this event was in San Antonio Texas.

There is a special feature with Del Rio being interviewed by my boy Matt Striker. Over all this was a good event. It was even better live homies coming from the great state of Texas. I enjoyed every match from top to bottom and back up. If you are a wrestling fan then you need to pick this up.",1322006400,3,4213,4.139364303178484
4573611,3,B0055CP9CM,"WWE Tag Team Champions Air Boom vs. Jack Swagger & Dolph Ziggler - Air Boom started out in control early with Kofi doing a monkey flip out of the corner on Dolph that flipped him inside out followed by making their fast tags & double team moves like a double baseball slide & later a double faceplant on Swagger.  Dolph & Swagger focused on grounding & working over Bourne after Swagger was able to block ""Air Bourne"" in order to keep him away from Kofi.  It was a textbook solid tag team match.

United States Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Zack Ryder - This match happened right after the tag title match with everyone involved that match staying at ringside.  Ryder went for quick pins knowing that Dolph was already exhausted causing Ryder to try to run away with both Air Boom & Swagger eventually getting involved in what was a decent match.

Divas Champion Beth Phoenix vs. Eve Torres - All outside parties were banned from ringside for this match while Eve debuted new music.  Knowing how both females have had issues with each other, they tore into each other right away with Eve somehow being able to tie Beth's hands into the ropes before Beth was able to recover & use her power by pressing Eve & dropping her on the barricade.  Both women tried to do submission holds with Beth doing a body scissors while Eve also applied the body scissors but included an armlock as well.  Some things didn't go over well here but both divas tried & worked hard here.

Sheamus vs. Christian - Sheamus dominated early as he just kept pounding on Christian in the corner & on the ropes before Christian was able to find an opening to take control.  Both men traded momentum & able to keep countering each others holds with Sheamus being able to keep standing after taking some hard shots from Christian such as missing the Crow Kick only to be on the receiving end of a spear while Christian would have the same effect happen to him later.  Just a good back & forth contest.

Triple H & C.M. Punk vs. The Miz & R-Truth - Triple H attempted to target Miz but he kept avoiding him in the early going before he got his hands on him & locked in a figure four early with Punk lending a hand for extra leverage.  Miz & Truth then decided to use the numbers game to take advantage & heavily work over Triple H building the hot tag to C.M. Punk but the big issue at the end of the match was a return of someone who definitely left their mark during & after the match.  This was a solid tag team match however it was missing the aggression that you would expect with this being setup as ""grudge"" match & was instead just a normal tag.

Randy Orton vs. Cody Rhodes - Former Legacy members face off here with Cody being in control early during the first half of the match before Orton was able to regain control in his favor after catching Cody was caught in midair with a dropkick.  Cody attempted some moves that we aren't familiar with him doing including various moonsault attempts & even trying to steal Orton's RKO at one point while also using his baggers were there to run interference.  It was an average match but both men worked such a similar style (very slow & calculated) that the match had it's slow & dull moments.

World Champion Mark Henry vs. Big Show - Both men locked right from the bell with Show doing something that nobody else has been able to do & beat down Henry in the corner causing Henry to go to the outside only for Show to throw him back him & nail him with a superkick.  Henry resorted to attacking Show's previously injured leg with shoulderblocks to the back of his leg & dropping all his weight on it with various elbows which did show it's effect on Show as he tried to slam Henry only to have his leg give out.  Both men continued to showcase their power against each other with both charging knocking each other down with a double clothesline, Show slamming Henry while Henry was able to hit the ""World's Strongest Slam"", Big Show chokeslamming Henry both in the ring & off the top rope, and Mark Henry delivering the superplex that made the ring itself say ""I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!""  The finish was something that we haven't seen for over 8 years but it was still quite the visual to this day & doesn't take away from the match as both men brought their best efforts here as this match was this wasn't your typical ""slow & boring"" limited big man match with both men telling a story & showcasing their power.

Last Man Standing Match: WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. John Cena - Johnny Ace (I can't spell his real last name) made the announcement that the WWE Championship match would still go on as planned as we saw the effects of this right away as Cena & Del Rio made their entrances only to back off when getting to the ring while pay attention to Cena as he had a special moment with a fan in regards to his new t-shirt.  The match started off with the dueling chants of ""Lets Go Cena...CENA SUCKS!"" as Ricardo Rodriquez was thrown into Cena right away for Del Rio to get the advantage as both men tried to wrestle in the ring with Del Rio delivering various back suplexes & doing Carlito's old ""backstabber"" but hurt his own ankle in the process because of the condition of the ring while Cena tried ""You Can't See Me"" but didn't have ropes to bounce off of & Del Rio doing a double stomp onto the broken ringpost that was on top of Cena's ribs. before Cena did a strong irish whip to Del Rio sending him right out of the ring onto the barricade since there were no ring ropes.  Both men used what they could at ringside like Cena being thrown into the steps while Ricardo & Del Rio had some teeter toter action with the broken ringpost before brawling backstage with Cena being buried underneath the interview set before making their way to the stage where Cena was thrown through it before Del Rio was put through a table followed by both men made their way back to ringside where they continued to brawl with an announce table getting broken in the process.  This was a very unique type of match just knowing the condition the ring was in but they used it to tell a good story & took advantage of the stipulation here at hand in what was the best match of the night.

This PPV had some positives in that there really wasn't a bad match on here with some people having the best match in their series (Show/Henry & Cena/Del Rio) but some matches really came off nothing special either (Ryder/Dolph & Orton/Rhodes).  With this being the third PPV in less than two months from WWE, we got some rematches that were just carbon copies of matches we've either seen on free TV or PPV recently as well (Tag Titles & Christian/Sheamus).  In the end, this wasn't worth the live PPV price but it definitely worth a rental.",1320192000,,6746,4.379503602882306
4573612,4,B0055CP9CM,"The Tag Team championship bout between Air Boom(Evan Bourne & Kofi Kingston) against the team of Jack Swagger & Dolph Ziggler had great high-flying action from Air Boom and great power-tech wrestling from Swagger & Ziggler. The United States championship bout between Dolph Ziggler & Zack Ryder was not great but pretty good. The Divas championship bout between Beth Phoenix & Eve had some nice back-and-forth action with both Divas doing their best. The Christian-Sheamus match was a bit slow but still a solid bout. The tag team match between the team of CM Punk & Triple H against the team of The Miz & R-Truth was a solid back-and-forth tag team bout with a nice twist ending of Kevin Nash coming out of the crowd and beating up HHH to boot. The Randy Orton-Cody Rhodes match was the sleeper bout of the card. The World's title match between Mark Henry & The Big Show was a classic hard-hitting big man bout with the twist ending of Mark suplexing Big Show onto the ring and then the ring crashing down on them to boot. The Last Man Standing match for the WWE title between Alberto Del Rio & John Cena was a hard hitting,smash mouth,drag out & ECW like brawl. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1319328000,,1196,4.465753424657534

NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2011

1.[TAG TITLE]AIR BOOM VS THE MIZ, R-TRUTH-excellent way to start the event off with a match that was really good. These two teams complimented each other rather well, and worked back and forth. This match had plenty of near falls and some really good spots. There was an awkward thing where Evan and Kofi pulled off a heel tactic with a tag the ref heard. It felt weird but it played out well with the conspiracy thing. Regardless Miz and Truth had this match won and I was all about it. But The Miz gets the DQ'd. The end here with the ref was excellent and very well done.

2.[I-C TITE]CODY RHODES VS TED DIBIASE-this was a pretty good match that turned into more of a brawl. A slower pace then the previous match but it was a good change of pace. Ted was in control a lot here taking to Cody and even getting his mask off. Still Cody proves to be the slicker wrestler and getting the win with a roll up.

3.[US TITLE FATAL FOUR WAY]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS ALEX RILEY VS JOHN MORRISON VS JACK SWAGGER-this right here was a fun one as these four way matches usually are. Of course the big story here was Vickie having to of her guys in the match. This match is full of high spots and high impact moves, non stop action from bell to bell. I would love to describe some of the stuff you will see here but it will be more fun for you to see it. I will say that I love the way Dolph keeps the belt here, great ending.

4.[WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS MARK HENRY-ah yes the match that made me oh so happy. The story here was Mark Henry trying to finally win the title after all these years. Henry proved how strong he was here in this match taking to Orton. In fact the story between these two was Randy trying to over come that. He was unable to after a decent match between the two [loved Henry's matches with Sheamus more so I think] in which Henry finally gets the title. I loved it.

5.[DIVA'S TITLE]KELLY KELLY VS BETH PHOENIX-in Beth's hometown you know who the crowd was behind. This was a good match with some back and forth with Beth getting the upper hand most of the time. Her superplex was great and I thought for sure she had the title won here. But Kelly Kelly [who is getting better ring wise] gets a surprise win with a nice roll up. I was honestly surprised by this out come despite their previous match at SummerSlam.

6.[WWE TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS JOHN CENA-this was a really good match up with these two. The action goes back and forth with each wearing the other down. They also hit some high impact moves on one another with the crowd into it, which is always the best thing. I have to say although it was a good match Del Rio should have kept the title. To me it would have made more sense but still it was a good match.

7.[NO DQ MATCH]CM PUNK VS TRIPLE H-now of course the match every one was waiting for and rightfully so. This had been built up so well leading up to this match that it had to be good. Thankfully it was with most CM Punk matches and Triple H delivered here as well. Triple H as the COO was looking to keep that job and beat Punk here. Punk on the other hand wanted Triple H out as COO, if he were to win Triple H would no longer be in that position. The match was great as they delivered on the no DQ stipulation to  the fullest. There was plenty of high spots and great moments throughout that included a lot of interference.  The Miz and R-Truth came down and laid waste to every one until Punk and Triple H got at them. Then of course Kevin Nash came out and handled his business. This all of course leads to Punk getting beat by Hunter; I still think he should have won.

The special feature for this is the contract signing between Punk and Triple H. Any way this was another good event from WWE but even still it was a little of a step down. Still this has been a good year over all for the WWE. There have been some misfires but compared to some other years it has been great.

SUMMERSLAM 2011

Spoilers

1. THE MIZ, R-TRUTH, ALBERTO DEL RIO VS REY MYSTERIO, JOHN MORRISON, KOFI KINGSTON-right here we had a great opening match pitting three of my favorite guys in Miz, Truth and Del Rio going at it against the baby faces they were semi feuding against prior to this. The match was faced paced with every one getting some shots in. The ""face"" team hit some high spots towards the end on their way to a victory. I really was hoping for the ""heel"" team to pull this out but they all would play big parts later on.

I loved the segment here with Punk and Steph, very funny.

2. SHEAMUS VS MARK HENRY-ah yes the match leading up to the match, and by that the final push of Henry to finally get the title. Here he was pitted against fellow tough guy Sheamus in a really good contest. Sheamus really brought it in this match taking it to Henry and looking great doing it. Still Mark was way to strong for him here beating him down for most of the match. On the outside he would ram him through the barricade and get the count out win.

3.[DIVA'S TITLE]KELLY KELLY VS BETH PHOENIX-now usually the diva's matches do not end up being all that great. They usually have to have Beth Phoenix or Natalya in them to be any where near good in my opinion. Thankfully they are both here with Beth in the match and Natalya on the outside in her corner. This match was better than most thought it would be I am sure with Kelly even looking good here. She some how comes out on top much to my chagrin. Still it was a good match with Kelly using her speed and Beth showcasing her strength.

4. DANIEL BRYAN VS WADE BARRETT-my boy Barrett was in action here against submission and wrestling machine Bryan the match here was great with both guys pulling out all stops to win the match. Bryan in particular came to play here pulling off stuff like a flying knee to the outside. Still by boy Wade comes out on top after another good match.

5.[NO HOLDS BARRED WORLD TITLE]CHRISTIAN VS RANDY ORTON-now this was a great match right here. One of my favorites Christian put the belt on the line against Orton here in a very entertaining and brutal match. These guys basically went to war right here using everything they could get their hands on. From in the ring to the outside and using everything that could be a weapon. The action here was excellent and was one of the most entertaining in a long time. Randy would get the belt back after a nasty RKO but still it was a great match.

6.[UNDISPUTED WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS JOHN CENA-the final match of the night was the one every one was looking forward to. As CM Punk returned to do battle once again with arch nemesis John Cena in another main event. In a rematch to the classic they put on a month prior. Once again they deliver a great match with a lot of solid back and forth action. There are near falls a plenty and a lot of drama, the crowd is so into this one. I love the ""Macho Man"" elbow drop that Punk does which send the crowd into a ""Randy Savage"" chant. The one thing I do not like about this match is that for some reason they refuse to give Punk a solid win over Cena. In their last one Cena only let go of the STF and was distracted by outside interference. In this one Cena gets a foot on the rope that guest referee Triple H does not see. Why can't they give him a clean win, still the shocker was yet to come. After the match Kevin Nash hit the ring and jackknifed Punk allowing Del Rio to cash in the MITB briefcase and win the title.

All in all I would say this was an excellent Summerslam event. The special feature on the DVD was an interview with Del Rio.",1318550400,2,3630,4.226551226551226
4573627,4,B0055CP9CM,"Well WWE tried but just could not have 3 great shows, but this was still a pretty good show

WWE Tag Team Title Match: Air Boom (Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston) vs R-Truth and The Miz
Wow this was actually a good tag match until the DQ ending but until then this was a good match. Really good to see some life being breathed back into the tag division again. 7.5/10

Cody Rhodes vs Ted DiBiase
Anyone else remember the days when Rhodes and DiBiase were on the same level, yeah those days are gone and this match shows it. Over the last year Cody has come into his own as a wrestler while DiBiase is just kind of there. Anyway this was a decent match but really nothing you wouldn't see on smackdown. (Now if Cody would just stop using that dull tone speaking voice). 7/10

Fatal 4 Way United States Championship match: Dolph Ziggler vs Jack Swagger vs john Morrison vs Alex Riley
Now is when the show as a little bit of a pick up. this was a really good match displaying the young talent and all of them looked good in this match. 8/10

World Hevyweight Championship match: Randy Orton vs Mark Henry
As strange as it sound Mark Henry has been looking decent over the last few months. This was a pretty good start to this fued and Orton made Mark Henry look somewhat credible. 8/10

Kelly Kelly vs Beth Phoenix
thankfully this finished fast 4/10

WWE Championship match: Alberto Del Rio vs John Cena
Cena did nothing to make Del Rio like a credible champion and really put the halts on this rising star, but what else i new. 7/10 (and that is only because Del Rio did get some decent offense in, but was never in control)

No DQ: Triple H vs CM Punk
Easily the best match of the night. HHH and Punk really took it to one another and watching this match almost felt like watching an attitude era match. This match delivered in every way possible 9.5/10",1317686400,,1849,4.311239193083574
4573628,5,B0055CP9CM,"Like the Title says following Money in the Bank this is the second fantastic show WWE has put on in a row.

Kofi Kingston, John Morrison, & Rey Mysterio vs The Miz, R-Truth, and Alberto Del Rio
This was a prett decent tag match and a good way to open the show. While this may not have been a great tag match it is certainly better than most in recent history and it is good to see WWE can still have a decent to good tag match. 7.5/10

Mark Henry vs Sheamus
This was the surprise match of the night in my opinion. Not because it was a grat match or anything, but it was leaps and bounds ahead of the travesty I was expecting. In fact this was a pretty decent power wrestling match. Sheamus really took the fight to Henry in this match. 7.5/10

Kelly Kelly vs Beth Phoenix
A typical divas match. I am really still confused as to why Kelly Kelly is champion instead of Beth or Natalya 3/10

Wade Barrett vs Daniel Bryan
It's really good to see Daniel Bryan on ppv again. Again This was a pretty good match a bit of back and forth, but nothing spectacular this could have been a smackdown main event or sub main event. 7.5/10

World Heavyweight Championship No Holds Barred: Christian vs Randy Orton
Before I talk about the match let me say this before this I was never really into the Orton/Christian fued and thoguht it was a bit boring then I saw this match. This was a great match and easily the best of thier fued (followed closely by thier steel cage match on smackdown a few weeks later). Both had a lot of offense a had some great spots that reminded you of the good old days when a match could be brutal, and yet not have blood. Both Orton and Christian brought thier A game for this match 9.5/10

WWE Undisputed Championship match: WWE Champion CM Punk vs WWE Champion John Cena w/ special guest referee HHH
Before Cena had this fued with Punk I believed that Cena had his best matches with HBK back in '07 and this fued is by far better than any of those matches (and that is really saying something in my opinion). Just like thier match at Money in the Bank this more than lived up to the hype and HHH being the referee didn't hurt this match at all like I thought it would. If you saw thier previous match then this match follows it very closely. While this match may not be quite as good as the previous match it is still a great one. Watch for the ending I don't think any of us saw coming. 9.5/10",1317686400,,2409,4.1922246220302375
4573629,4,B0055CP9CM,"WWE Tag Team Champions Air Boom vs. Awesome Truth - Before the match, Truth came out with a remixed version of his old ""What's Up"" theme under the new name ""U SUCK!""  Kofi & Bourne were in control early by keeping a fresh man in with quick tags while using double team moves like stereo top rope dives onto Truth & Miz on the outside.  Miz & Truth were able to regain control & did ""classic tag team wrestling 101"" by keeping him away from Kofi & grounding him taking away his high flying offense.  The bigger story here was when things broke down with the referee missing calls that ended up working in favor of Air Boom causing Miz & Truth to take matters into their own hands.  This was a good opening match but was more about the story behind Miz & Truth's ""conspiracy.""

Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase - Former Legacy members against each other here with Dibiase coming out very aggressive & more focused on brawling than wrestling with his intense punches & even kicking Cody in the face at one point.  Cody tried to slow down the pace with various holds & stretches but resorted to using the mask as a weapon which caused Ted to try to beat Cody at his own game towards the end in what was a solid match.

United States Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. John Morrison vs. Alex Riley vs. Jack Swagger - As you expect from a fatal four way match, this was non-stop action with everyone getting their various moments & stories told.  From Swagger & Dolph competing for Vickie Guerrero's attention, Morrison delivering a dropkick on one person & landing on another in a pinfall position all in one move, Morrison's unique counter of Swagger's attempted slam, and when Swagger & Dolph had their submission holds on at the same time.  One moment to look out for was when where Dolph & Morrison were fighting on the top rope with Morrison falling into the tree of woe position with his head striking the mat on the way down before Riley leaped over Morrison onto the top rope with Ziggler only for Morrison to pull himself up & back suplex Riley off the top followed by Swagger leaping to the top rope & hip tossed Dolph off.  As I said, non-stop action while continuing the story between both Swagger & Dolph fight over Vickie Guerrero.

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Mark Henry - After Henry showed his power advantage early, Orton was able to knock Henry off his feet & focused on his knees & ankle while also showing his speed advantage by side stepping Henry causing him to fall to the outside.  However Henry's power advantage was showcased such as wrapping Orton around the ringpost & a big splash while Orton continued to try to chop Henry down with clotheslines, dropkicks, and even able to do the hanging DDT.  This match did it's job in putting Henry over as a big strong monster heel but the match itself was as well worked as you would expect since Henry is very limited & but a step down from his previous series against Sheamus.

Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Phoenix - This was the same setup as their previous match at SummerSlam with Eve & Natayla being in their partner's corners with the major difference being that this was in Beth's hometown so the crowd was heavily on her side.  Kelly had the advantage with her quickness & athleticism but Beth clearly showcased her power when she caught Kelly in mid air & spanked her in the ring before choking her in the ropes.  Eve & Natayla ended up getting into a fight on the outside while Beth continued to dominate including a superplex off the top rope before Kelly was able to pull out a quick roll through to the surprise win.  This was almost the exact same match as their previous one at SummerSlam which may sound bad but it was still better than the usual divas matches we are used to seeing.

WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. John Cena - We had some comedic moments before the match in regards to the entrance of both men from Del Rio's car to Cena being a ""fighting Fruity Pebble.""  The crowd being split for both men here & Ricardo ending up being sent to the back early making this a one on one match.  Both men traded momentum early with Del Rio wearing down Cena with chinlocks & knees into the ribs but Cena was able to regain momentum when Del Rio missed a dropkick that caused him to slip right through the ropes to the floor.  Cena attempted the A.A. but Rio was able to counter with a backstabber followed by his sidekick while Cena was on the top rope but Cena was able to hurt Del Rio's shoulder when he missed a shoulderblock & hit the ringpost.  Both men from here took it to the air was Del Rio came off the top rope to land backfirst onto Cena while Cena also hit his legdrop from the top.  This was a very good match as Cena brought his A game here & didn't do his ""stereotypical"" performance of walking through his match while this was also Del Rio's best PPV performance in months since moving to RAW earlier this year.

No Disqualification Match: Triple H vs. C.M. Punk - The PPV called ""Night Of Champions"" is main evented by a non-title match (how funny is that) but Triple H's position as Chief Operating Officer is on the line.  A few side notes here before the match is that this is Triple H's first match since WrestleMania, Michael Cole at this point in the show lost his voice so it's just Booker & Lawler commentating the match, and you'll get a chuckle out of the new C.M. Punk t-shirt that he wears to the ring.  Punk kick started the match right away by jumping Triple H during his entrance & threw him over the ringside barrier with Triple H bouncing back & throwing Punk over the announce table.  Both men took back in to the ring & brawled with ramming Punk's knee into the pole twice before both men taking the fight through the crowd onto the stage & back in to the ring.  Punk used a chair into the ring before wedging it in a corner only for it to work against him when Triple H whipped him through the chair onto the outside.  Triple H continued to work on Punk's leg using the ringpost & a chair before Punk countered by sending Triple H into the steps at ringside & delivering an impact move that the announcers described as ""SAVAGE!""  we saw various people get involved from Miz & Truth coming in only to attack BOTH men, Johnny Ace (V.P. of Talent Relations) & his actions looking like that he was biased towards one competitor in the match, and Kevin Nash again having his issues with both men.  This was the match of the night as they played to the ""No DQ"" rule & buildup very well as this was more of a fight than wrestling match while continuing the various storylines involving everyone involved here.

In the end, this PPV did it's job as far as furthering storylines while giving up some good matches that ranged from solid & very well done as I don't consider this PPV to have a bad unwatchable match on here so it's one worth checking out.",1317513600,2,6890,4.392295597484277
4573630,4,B0055CP9CM,"The PPV started off very well with the Tag Team Championship Match between Air Boom and The Awesome Truth but it ended in DQ, so not a very good ending. Cody Rhodes vs The Million Dollar Man's Son for the Intercontinental Championship was pretty good but not great because it didn't have enough build up. The Fatal Four Way for the US Championship was alright but poor Jomo continues getting buried. My man Mark Henry wins his first Major Title by defeating Randy Orton and does it with a clean victory so that was Great. Beth Phoenix should have won the Divas Title, I mean it was her hometown, this kinda upset me but Hey the WWE is gonna keep their top Diva on top. John Cena is now a 10 Time WWE Champion ,What else is New? Now, the match that saved the PPV Triple H VS CM Punk (No DQ Match) very good match it felt like an Attitude Era Match, which I miss so deeply. Overall, I gave the PPV 6/10 but I'm hoping Hell in a Cell in two weeks would be better.",1316390400,6,960,4.13903743315508
4573631,3,B0055CP9CM,"The tag team title match was not great but pretty good with the DQ ending to ruin it. The IC title match between Cody Rhodes & Ted Dibiase Jr was passable. The 4 way bout for the US title was good in trems of 4 ways. The Worlds title match between Randy Otron & Mark Henry was a classic David & Goliath battle but this time,Goliath(Mark Henry)won. The Divas title match between Kelly Kelly & Beth Phoenix was also not great but pretty good. The WWE title match between Alberto Del Rio & John Cena was a mediocre bout with a predictable John Cena win to make it worse. The No-DQ Match between Triple H & CM Punk was a smash-mouth,wild,hardcore & ruthless brawl. I give this event a 7 out of 10.",1316390400,2,693,4.2180451127819545
4573632,1,B0055CP9CM,"Every match sucked or had a god awful finish:

Tag Team Title Match: The Miz/R-Truth vs. Air Boom as the opener was as if neither side had practiced together/among one another. Terrible match that ends in a DQ win for Air Boom. Really? An opener that ends in DQ? 2/10

IC Title Match: Cody Rhodes vs. Ted DiBiase was the best match of the night. And even that was just an ok match. Ted takes off the mask and tries to hit Cody with it but gets pinned anyway, Cody retains. 5/10

Fatal Four Way for the U.S. Title: Swagger vs. Ziggler vs. Morrison vs. Riley. Another crooked finish with Ziggler winning. Was also just an ok match. Morrison sucks in the ring, Riley is overrated, and Ziggler as a soon-to-be face is not working. 5/10

World Title Match: Mark Henry vs. Randy Orton. Slow as hell, Orton gets crapped on the whole time, makes one small comeback towards the end but Henry gets the win anyway with the World's Strongest Slam. 90% of that match was all Henry. And it was bad. At least he finally got some recognition after a long career. 3/10

Divas Title Match: Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly. Just like every Divas match: boring and a waste of time. And Kelly Kelly wins with a rollup. Anybody else tired of KK or what? 2/10

WWE Title Match: Del Rio vs. John Cena. Ok match, but why does Cena always have to win? WHY? They make him look invincible. Not even Hulk Hogan pulled this off. Which is STUNNING to think about. Cena cannot wrestle and is overrated. What's worse is that they made Del Rio look like all the other MITB winners: flukes. 4/10

CM Punk vs. Triple H: LOL! The main event?! And it didn't even live up to ANY of the hype. Decent spots at first, but then Miz and R-Truth come out of nowhere and start attacking them both. CM Punk and Triple H retaliate, but then Johnny Ace appears and starts messing with them too. And Kevin Nash returns through the crowd and does the same thing. Which made no sense. I was hoping that, if anything happened, all four would side with one or the other, maybe starting a new faction or something. But no. No explanation. No reasoning behind all four of them being there. And Triple H nails three Pedigrees on CM Punk and finally beats him to close out the PPV. 3/10

Overall: 3/10. And people think WrestleMania XXVII was bad. Take a look at this PPV before you ever crap on WM 27 again.",1316304000,,2347,4.342465753424658
4573633,5,B0055CP9CM,"The night where every title in the WWE is on the line, including Mark Henry attempting to erase 15 years of doubt and claim the World Title from Randy Orton and also whether its Alberto Del Rio's destiny to remain the WWE champion as he takes on John Cena.

Live from Buffalo, N.Y. Michael Cole, Booker T and Jerry Lawler welcome us and we start off with the tag team title contest.

-WWE Tag Team Championship Match, Kofi Kingston & Evan Bourne (Champions) vs. R-Truth & The Miz: Nice double teaming early on by Kofi and Bourne, even hitting dueling dives off the top to the outside. Soon after Miz and Truth take over wearing down Bourne, stomping him and keeping him on the mat, before Evan makes the tag to Kofi who turns it up hitting the Boom Drop on the Miz. But after the S.O.S. Miz kicks out and he soon hits a modified diamond cutter driving Kofi's head into the mat but he kicks out. Bourne misses Air Bourne, Miz covers and Kofi makes the save, Miz hits the Skull Crushing Finale but the ref is distracted by Truth. Miz pushes the ref and gets his team DQ'd. Good opening match, lousy finish. 6/10. Afterwards Miz pushes the ref then Truth comes to calm him down before hitting the ref.

-Now there's the usual anti-bullying campaign and then a lame Inside Out trailer.

-Backstage with Truth and Miz, Matt Striker interviews both and they say the ref was part of the conspiracy they keep talking about.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Cody Rhodes (Champion) vs. Ted DiBiase: After months of abuse by Cody, Ted attacked Rhodes at ringside 2 days prior on Smackdown and now we have this match. Ted takes it to Cody early on, with a side headlock and kept trying to remove Rhodes protective mask, then hit a dropkick for two. After a knee to the gut, Cody hits Ted with the mask and makes a cover for two. Rhodes then beats down Ted and trash talks him, Cody locks on an Abdominal Stretch and just wears down Ted before hits a great clothesline and a flying leg attack for two. He then hits an arm drag off the top and finally removes Cody's mask, but he gets rolled up for three and Rhodes retains. 6/10.

-Christian's music hits and he starts talking about how he deserves another shot at the winner of the World Title match tonight. He then knocks the Buffalo Bills for having never won the Super Bowl, but he has and he deserves one more match, then Sheamus' music hits. He cuts a weird promo about his uncle's lucky green..... well anyways, but he then goes on to say if Christian does win he wants the first shot, then hits a big kick and leaves the ring.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the WWE United States Championship, Dolph Ziggler (Champion)w/Vickie Guerrero vs. John Morrison vs. Jack Swagger vs. Alex Riley: The action starts off and Riley hits a splash to the outside but hits the steel steps, Morrison hits a dropkick on Dolph then a splash on Swagger. We now have the expected face/off between Dolph and Swagger, Riley hits a swinging neckbreaker for two, then gets a dropkick from Dolph who then gets a jumping kick from Morrison for two. Nice exchanges as Morrison hits a back suplex from the top on Riley, then Dolph gets nailed with an arm drag from Swagger. Morrison hits moves on each of the guys, then goes for Starship Pain but Riley counters with knees to the gut. After countering the ankle lock, Riley hits a DDT on Swagger for two, Jack hits the powerbomb on Morrison, Dolph knocks him out of the way and makes the cover for three to retain his title. 7/10.

-Josh Matthews is backstage with Mark Henry, who says he'll prove the doubters wrong tonight.

-Matt Striker talks to Vickie who says after Dolph's win everyone in the locker room is buzzing, she then kisses Striker for no reason.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Mark Henry: Almost 15 years ago to the day, Mark Henry made his WWE debut and honestly injuries had derailed his career up until recently. The crowd is flat in the early going, Orton takes down Henry and kicks at his knee and ankle, Mark comes back hitting a massive clothesline then whips him into the turnbuckles and hits a splash in the corner. Orton goes for a sleeper but Henry counters then knocks Randy over the top rope to the floor, then locks on a stretch against the ringpost working on Orton's back. Mark just beats down and wears on Randy for a few minutes, Orton comes back but is getting booed. Henry goes for the Vader Bomb but misses then Orton knocks him down and hits the DDT off the ropes, but Mark grabs the rope before the 3 count. Henry blocks the RKO, hits the World's Strongest Slam and makes the cover to win the World Title. 9/10. Josh Matthews is in the ring and Henry says he knew he would win the title and he proved the doubters wrong.

-Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo are backstage with John Laurenitis, who wishes Del Rio luck in his match. He also wishes Punk luck who says he doubts John's sincerity.

-WWE Diva's Championship Match, Kelly Kelly (Champion) w/Eve vs. Beth Phoenix w/Natalya: The crowd pops big for Beth as Buffalo is her hometown, and Kelly tries to work on Beth's head but she gets knocked down by the stronger woman. Beth just beats up Kelly, choking her against the rope, goes for the cover for two. Kelly counters and hits a facebuster, Eve attacks Natalya on the outside but Beth breaks it up and almost gets caught in a roll-up for two. Beth hits a clothesline for two and the crowd cheers big for Beth, who hits a big supersplex and both are down, Beth crawls to the cover but Kelly kicks out at 2. Beth attempts a Glam-Slam but gets rolled up for three and Kelly retains and the crowd boos big time. 7/10. Side Note: I personally feel that was a mistake as Beth should've won in her hometown.

-WWE Championship Match, Alberto Del Rio (Champion) vs. John Cena: Del Rio comes down without his car and wonders where it is, then of course Cena comes out in the car to a decent reaction. We get the usual intro from Ricardo for Del Rio, then Cena introduces himself in typical cheesy fashion. Early on Ricardo grabs Cena's leg, the ref sees it and throws him out, Del Rio comes back with a kick to the ribs and takes it to the outside. Back in the ring Alberto hits a double axe handle off the top and makes the cover for two, then locks on a neck vice. Cena comes back hitting his usual moves including a fisherman's buster out of the corner. Cena comes back but eats a clothesline for two. Now we have Cena's comeback and the usual ""You Can't See Me"", but Del Rio counters the AA for two and hits a kick to the back. Alberto hits a high kick off the ropes on Cena but only for two, Del Rio hits a backbreaker but he misses a shoulder block and goes shoulder first into the ring post and there's a nasty popping sound. After a bit more action Del Rio locks on the cross arm breaker, but Cena lifts him from the mat in a powerbomb move. He locks on the STF and Del Rio taps out, we have a new champ. 8/10.

-No DQ Match, Triple H vs. CM Punk, If Triple H loses he must resign as COO: Punk comes out to a big reaction and is wearing a new shirt with an ice cream bar that has his picture on it, Triple H also gets a good reaction and does his usual posing before the match, but Punk attacks him from behind and throws him over the barricade. Punk counters a pedigree attempt and hits shoulder blocks in the corner but misses a high knee and goes over the rope to the outside. Trips takes advantage and slams Punk's knee into the ring post. The match spills into the crowd and into the entrance way, both men battle through the entrance way and back to the ring and the crowd is on Punk's side. After a spinbuster Trips works on Punk's leg more slamming it into the ring post and hitting it with a chair. Punk goes for a Macho Man elbow from the top and drives Trips through the announce table. Miz and R-Truth run down and beat up both guys, but put Punk on Trips the ref counts but only for 2. Miz and Truth beat up the ref for not counting to three, then John Laurenitis comes down, Trips hits the pedigree on Punk, another ref comes down and John stops him. Punk hits the GTS but Truth breaks up the pinfall. Punk kicks out of a pedigree, Kevin Nash comes through the crowd and nails both men, Punk goes after Nash but gets the Jacknife powerbomb. Trips hits Nash with a sledgehammer on the outside, then back in the ring hits the pedigree and makes the cover to win. 10/10.

Pretty good PPV here, all the matches ended with the expected winners, though I must admit I thought Beth would win. Its worth buying on DVD.",1316304000,2,8574,4.353345841150719
