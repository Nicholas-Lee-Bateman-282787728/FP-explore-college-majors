2681858,2,B000K2UGXO,"I could recommend ""All the King's Men"" if Sean Penn's performance was the only criteria. Sadly, it isn't, and that forces me to look at the film negatively; this is a well intended film that completely loses its way, falling victim to needlessly complicated details and virtually nonexistent character development. I never once felt that I had the chance to know these characters, which is bad because I could tell the actors put a lot of work into making them believable. It's really a shame this film falls flat. All the components are there, but they aren't used to the best of their ability.

This remake of the 1949 Academy Award winning film (which itself was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren) is a fictional reinterpretation of Huey Long, the Democratic Louisiana governor assassinated in 1935. The film changes him into Willie Stark, originally played by Broderick Crawford and now played by Sean Penn. I don't dare analyze how faithful this 2006 film is to either the 1949 film or the original novel, nor do I dare attempt to compare the Stark portrayals to Long's real-life mannerisms. There's simply too much I'm not aware of. All I can do is focus on this film as a separate entity, one that is initially enhanced by Penn's brilliant performance. There's no question that the man can act. He certainly pulls no punches when it comes to Willie Stark, whose energetic, tell-it-like-it-is campaign got him elected as governor of Louisiana.

The other actors give reasonable performances, as well. The exception is Jude Law as reporter Jack Burden; while his performance wasn't bad, he still seemed out of place in this story. It's as if he were hired out of convenience rather than for his ability to portray a plausible Southern gentleman. Law has and always will be a Hollywood Pretty Boy, meaning he'll be too attractive for any of his roles to seem authentic. Then again, his character was born into the Southern upper class, a social stature notorious for creating attractive facades (symbolically or physically). In that sense, one can argue that Law was the perfect choice to portray that character.

The story in and of itself is fairly straightforward. Taking place during the first half of the 1950s, it involves Burden being personally hired by Stark to gather information on Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), Burden's beloved godfather. It would seem that Irwin is attempting to have Stark impeached; his ideas on helping the working class and the poor are threatening to the rich, especially since they involve a fair number of building projects. By digging into Irwin's past and finding fault with his character, Stark hopes he can turn the tables in his favor. This doesn't sit too well with Burden, who knows the old man will never budge once his mind is made up.

This indirectly connects to another of Stark's political agendas. He hopes to build Louisiana's finest medical facility and staff it with the best doctors and nurses the state has to offer. Here enters Adam Stanton (Mark Ruffalo), Burden's friend since childhood. He's considered a doctor by Stark even though the audience has no way of knowing this to be true; not only is Stanton's personality incompatible with that of a classic doctor character, he's also never seen in a hospital, a clinic, or even in a dramatic medical situation. The best we're given is his history, both with his sister, Anne (Kate Winslet), and with Burden. The details are sketchy at best, but it would seem that the three of them spent quite a bit of time together as children, and they continued to remain close as they grew older.

This aspect of the story was the most baffling because it had little if anything to do with Stark's political aspirations. At times, it felt like I was watching scenes from a completely different movie. One especially telling flashback sequence shows Burden and Anne alone in an upstairs bedroom. The sexual tension is overwhelming, for both them and the audience. It was a good scene, but it was also completely different in tone from the rest of the film. Burden's back-story didn't feel contrived so much as it seemed altogether out of touch with the plot. It was as if another story idea found its way into the screenplay of ""All the King's Men."" Maybe another movie needed to be made, one that would focus solely on the relationship between Jack Burden and Anne Stanton. It probably would have been just as interesting. It only needed the chance to fully develop.

The same can be said for Adam, who felt as enigmatic as a complete stranger. His current situation hints at a severe depression; according to both Burden and Anne, he's becoming increasingly reclusive. An explanation for such an emotional decline would have been nice, considering it would dramatically add to the story. Alas, one is never given, and that ultimately serves to turn Ruffalo's character into an excuse for filler material. He has a couple of tense conversations with Burden as well as with Stark, who he fears is using him as a pawn in an ever-deepening sea of political corruption. When you factor in Stanton's importance during the final scene, you'll understand why it was wrong for his character to be so unknown.

I really wanted to like ""All the King's Men,"" especially when another notable Sean Penn performance is at stake. Unfortunately, far too much is left in the dark, especially in terms of characterization. Besides Adam Stanton, there are a slew of other properly introduced characters that are ultimately discarded. These include Burden's mother (Kathy Baker), the corrupt Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), the perpetually skeptical Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson), and Sugar Boy (Jackie Earle Haley), Stark's chauffer and bodyguard. Even the more defined characters are too mysterious to allow the story to sink in. Strong performances are given for characters that aren't completely fleshed out, a flaw that made this film almost intolerable.

How sad for Robert Penn Warren. If he were alive today, he'd probably be shocked at the notion of a Pulitzer Prize winner not being enough for a decent film adaptation. If I were in his place, I'd be shocked, too.",1159056000,3,6187,4.908221797323136
2681859,4,B000K2UGXO,"Sean Penn's performance (not to mention his weight!) was HUGE, and at times overwhelming.  But, that was the character he was playing: A HUGE a and, at times, overwhelming candidate/governor.  Penn nailed the part dead on.  His speeches were, at first, a bit googfy.  But then you got into his character and really started to understand the he was a self-proclaimed ""hick"", and therefore spoke like a half-drunk guy from the sticks.  (And is that gauze stuffed in his mouth??)

Jude Law played a great reluctant reporter that refused to be a part of anything, even though he was an important cog on the governor's machine.  Law managed to nail this part amazingly well, and often made me forget that it was Jude Law up there - now THAT'S convincing.  (Unlike Batman Begins where you sat there watching big-name actors never quite being convincing enough to hide their well-known personas.)

Winslet was the one person that had me wincing.  Was it the blonde hair and dark eyebrows?  Was it the quirky acting?  Was it the way she just didn't seem to be on the same level as all of the others?  I think it was all three that just kept popping off the screen.  I found every scene she was in to be drasticly unbalanced and quirky.  My wife doesn't agree, and thinks that maybe that's how the character was meant to be: drastic, quirky and fake.

Hopkins as the judge was, again, right on.  He played the retired judge that was putting pressure on the legislature to impeach the governor.  Most of the movie involves trying to find some dirt on the judge so that he might call of the impeachment proceedings.

Of course, things don't go neatly and we start to learn that none of the characters are exactly what they seem.  Except one...

I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  It is NOT one of those movies that have to be seen in the theater like the 'Rings' trilogy or StarWars, so you could wait for the DVD.

Minus 1 star for the inconsistant accents used throughout the film.  I know it's one of the toughest things to do, but in this day and age and with the caliber of actors I expected something closer and more consistant.",1158883200,2,2120,4.532981530343008

2681879,5,B000K2UGXO,"Robert Penn Warren's 1946 important novel, ""All the King's Men,"" sparked a film in 1949, and Carlisle Floyd's opera, ""Willie Stark,"" in 1981.  In 2006, Steven Zaillian's new cinematic version was premiered, starring Sean Penn, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson, and Sir Anthony Hopkins, to decidedly tepid reviews.

Such a reception is inexplicable to this writer, who regards the enterprise as brilliant.  Zaillian, who had previously given us ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" creates a morosely beautiful atmosphere, moving the tale to the nineteen-fifties.  In fact, the Louisiana seen here reminds this writer of scenes of his childhood, when the State was more rural, roads were often unpaved, and air-conditioning was a rarity.  The sheer ugliness (aesthetically and otherwise) of the nineteen-sixties had not yet descended upon us like a plague of locusts.  This film captures the Pelican State's elusive ambiance to a startling degree.

Perhaps certain critics resented the level of complexity involved, with forays into philosophical and even theological territory.  But the acting here is magnificent, representing some of the finest work from these artists.  If one believes Penn's performance a bit overt, one should watch a minute of old newsreel-footage of Huey Long, prototype of the main character, Willie Stark.  No, Penn is thrilling.

Law gives, instead, a laconic performance, like a cat stretching his limbs in the sun.  He is enveloped in sadness.  Winslet is also excellent, her character caught in the midst of this sultry purgatory.  Gandolfini gives one of his finest performances, and Ruffalo is superb as the thinking-man's assassin.

Miss Clarkson (who rightly declares in a Special Features interview that Louisiana is still imbued with the spirit of Huey Long) is one of our finest actresses, and is here most eloquent.  Sir Anthony's portrayal is filled with a kaleidoscope of feelings and thoughts; he is extraordinary as a Southern aristocratic, whose breed hated Long/Stark.

The aforementioned Special Features are highly interesting, including interview footage with James Carville.  The Deleted Scenes are particularly worthwhile, including an uncredited performance by John ""Spud"" McConnell as J.H. Moore, in a confrontation with Stark.  McConnell is the stage's great interpreter of Long, having triumphantly appeared Off-Broadway in ""The Kingfish.""  (This writer can recall him, in the actor's college years, as Tevye in ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" opposite the great Libbye Hellier as the ghost, Fruma-Sarah.)

With this picture, one of America's great novels has become one of America's great films.

*  Following Norman Treigle's untimely death in 1975, a draft of the libretto of Carlisle Floyd's opera based on the novel was found amongst his effects, under these titles.  One can surmise that the composer (whose ninetieth birthday is occurring as these lines are being written) intended the title role for the great singing-actor.  The opera was not, however, to be premiered until 1981, when it was seen at the Houston Grand Opera, in a production by Harold Prince, under the title ""Willie Stark.""",1465603200,4,3179,5.438775510204081

2681910,4,B000K2UGXO,"Having watched two different cinematic accounts of All the King's Men, the common assessment that the 1949 film, with Broderick Crawford as Willie Stark (Columbia Pictures/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 13052 being the edition viewed), is a greater movie than the 2006 film starring Sean Penn in the same role (Columbia Pictures/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment16953-LIT being the ""Special Edition"" watched) seems rather debatable. That is not because Sean Penn is better than Broderick Crawford in that role; Penn is, indeed excessively, rather clownishly over-the-top, but so, to only a little lesser degree (but more believably) Crawford is also. Penn's faked Southern accent, however, is pretty dreadful, too, and is grossly exaggerated. Newsreels of the time convey what Long really was like, in looks and in public behaviour, and it is Crawford who most approximates the Huey Long of history.

This review is meant to apply to both motion pictures as released on DVD, Blu-Ray, or VHS.

The other actors in the 2006 film may not quite sound like native-born Southerners, either; however, not going so far to fake the regional accent, they irritate less than Sean Penn does. (Having a whole side of the family from Southern roots, that kind of linguistic fakery always sets this viewer's teeth gritting and on edge!)

The cast of the film, aside from Sean Penn, is superb. Jude Law's portrayal of Jack Burden is especially poignant, and, in its quiet way, very effective and subtle. John Ireland, a Canadian-born actor, is effective in the role of Jack Burden, but Law brings just that much more subtlety and personal appeal to the part, although Law does not have the reservations, and hence more intensely felt and expressed ambiguities, about supporting and working with Willie Stark, written more strongly into the 1949 film's very script, that Ireland portrays.

Actually, for the history behind the story, Huey Long, the real life politician that Stark's character represents, could be quite the buffoon, too, as well as quite ruthless; one had to take the progressive good along with the dictatorial bad back then in supporting Huey Long Huey Long, who was corrupt, yes, but who had a real heart for the people of Louisiana, unlike the lying, greedy graft-hogs feeding fiscally at the public trough in government in our own times, the early decades of the 21st century, at the national level (and in numerous states) in the U. S. of A. under Clinton, Bush Jr. and Obama, in the Dominion of Canada under Harper, and among the rest of the neo-con corrupted English-speaking world under their respective leaders (and among the various continental nations of the European Union and their ruling elite).

The 2006 motion picture is considerably much more atmospheric and artistic, as a whole, than the earlier movie. The 1949 film seems too didactic and overly controlled, the acting and direction of all of its cast (not merely singling out Broderick Crawford) is excessively overdrawn and too obvious. That 1949 movie is the well-made-film ""to a tee"", but it suffers comparison with the 2006 motion picture partly from that very fact.

Both cinematic renderings of southerner Robert Penn Warren's novel are the kind of dramatic films about the South that do not heap the kind of contempt, derision, or condescension on the region unlike so the motion pictures of so many of Hollywood's hostile Yankee interlopers. It is well worth it to see both of the films based upon this story and on Louisiana's fascinating political lore. The 1949 movie, set in the 1930s (like Huey Long's career and Warren's novel itself) was an Academy Award winner and has remained a famous classic of American cinema.

A more incidental advantage of the 1949 film is that Broderick Crawford looks rather a lot like Huey Long himself; certainly Crawford was of very much the same physical ""type"" as Long. The 2006 film, apart from Sean Penn's buffoonery and grotesquely exaggerated accent (and lack of physical resemblance to Huey Long), for its part, is very evocative of the later period (1950s) in which it is set.

Among the several welcome bonus features of the DVD edition cited of the 2006 film are scenes deleted from the movie. Watch them! There is much in the dialogue that amplifies and clarifies motives of what Willie Stark and others do. The final scene, apart from being in b&w and in sepia (highlighting the redness of blood, in colour, that flows in such a context), does not differ much from the film's depiction of the assassination, but it extends the end to the funerals and a conversation that Jack Burden has with Sugar, Willie's chief bodyguard, which also reveals a key element in what led to the governor's murder and to what propelled Adam Stanton's to carry it out.

Many consider these two films to be veritable monuments of Hollywood excellence. Maybe so, maybe not---. Be sure to view both of them to judge for oneself!",1410134400,,4936,4.987849331713244

2681924,4,B000K2UGXO,"Hi, I am Hadassah Broscova, Editor of two international magazines, one of them includes film and other visual arts.

I simply wanted to say that I was surprised at the viewpoints expressed here--that is not to say that everything should be ""good"" to everyone--G-d forbid.  What I am saying is that there are so few films these days that envelope or at least engage in the following:
1. Character development--background, motivational drivers, vulnerabilities and strengths.
2. Character delineation--a powerful eclectic cast which represents different points of view, walks of life, realities and awarenesses.
3.  WELL WRITTEN storyline.  ESSENTIAL.  So many films these days resort to the cheap tricks of shock ""value"" purposeless sex scenes, and random, over-the-top violence.  It is so good to see someone return to that which has always made a movie ""great"".  Great writing.

Specifically, I felt the back story, inner thoughts and psychological reflections of Jude Law's character made this particularly valuable.  Not only because of the intimate nature of the reflections of things long lost and transformations embarked upon, but also the fact that he was cognizant of how these things rang true for the common man in a common existence.  He recognizes the moments of life's pivotal decisions and applies them in thought to everyone else's experience.  Case and point, when he reflects upon his lost love and the decision he makes to re-enter the water with her, and then later, to refuse to share his first sexual experience with her.

The irony was powerful as well in that it could well have been a factor in her later, more insecure view of herself that lead to her untimely elicit relation with Stark.  Anyway, there is a great deal I could review about this film, but in short, I think it was so good, I watch it at least once a month, just to revisit the gossamer feel and the sepia tones in the recollected monologues.  Well done, esp. Mr. Law and Mr. Penn.  The noted vulnerability in Ms. Winslet was also appreciated.  I thought the cast was well chosen.  I lived in the south for a time to go to school, and rarely found anything valuable in it, to be honest (aside from the equally dissatisfied transplants--wonderful people by the way).  I found it in general, to be hostile, prejudiced, and generally disagreeable, not to mention swarming with poisonous insects and snakes.  I live in Oregon and abroad now, but I will say, that this film somehow brought out a humanity in the south, and struck a chord that seemed authentic and easily overlooked.  Kudos.

2681941,4,B000K2UGXO,"All the King's Men is the second film adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name loosely based on Louisiana populist demagogue Huey Long.  It follows Jack Burden (played by Jude Law), a journalist turned political fixer, and Willie Stark (played by Sean Penn), a reformer turned corrupt political boss.

Dispensing with the obfuscation of the novel, All the King's Men is openly set in Louisiana.  Inexplicably it's Louisiana sometime well after Huey Long's life, replete with the forward pass, but that doesn't make much difference.  It was a cruel time.  Men were forced to walk around outdoors in Louisiana wearing three-piece suits (thankfully, the Louisiana weather is a sovereign cure for all hangovers; that's why they drink so much).

The dialogue captures the poeticism of the South.  We don't actually talk like that, but by God we do in our heads.  And Jude Law has a fake Southern accent that, unlike that of most of Hollywood, is melodious rather than nails-on-a-chalkboard.

Sean Penn hams it up as usual, but Jude Law delivers a strong performance.  Anthony Hopkins and James Gandolfini nearly steal the show in small roles.  It is the shifting focus between Penn as Willie Stark and everyone else that determines whether any given scene is good or great.  The worst are the Stark speeches, political diatribes sort of haphazardly stuck in at odd places.  Better are the scenes when Stark joins several other characters, and best of all when he is off screen, if never out of the characters' minds.  Stark gets a bit more attention relative to Jack than in the book, but even with a 2 hour+ running time his story still gets cut criminally short.  His wife and son barely appear.  He sort of leaps from idealistic reformer to venal, disenchanted political boss in between scenes.  It's not enough to seriously detract from the film, thought.

There are approximately an hour and a half of DVD extras, including The Making of ""All the King's Men,"" An American Classic, La. Confidential: On Location with ""All the King's Men,"" Shake Hands with the Devil, the Legend and Lore of Huey Long, and deleted scenes (including an alternate ending).  The video footage of Hey Long in the mini-documentary about him was especially interesting.  A man of the age of radio, Long's charisma is evident but he's not very photogenic.  and deleted scenes (including an alternate ending).

2681943,4,B000K2UGXO,"This was an adaption of a novel of the same name which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1946.  There was a 1949 movie version but I think this one was better even though it did poorly at the Box Office. The tale is about a reporter, Jude Law, with aristocratic ties who takes an interest in a lowly politician named Stark, played by Sean Penn, who gradually rises to power as governor through his ""hick to hick"" speeches. At first it seems like they have a good governor until they discover the Stark character is just dirty in other ways. To make matters worse Stark demands that the reporter dig up dirt on his judge stepfather and basically messes up other parts of his life. The scandal and dirt is a bit dated for our times but it's still done well. Most of this film was shot in the state of Lousiana and the Stark character is based on Lousiana governor Huey Long. The first ""hick"" speech was the best of the bunch. Look for James Gandolfini falling in the mud. Other notables in this were Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet and Kathy Baker. There's a basic message of our morality and the bald cypress trees and decaying mansions were not put in randomly. They're speaking of a decay of morality. All said though we've heard this message in many different forms before and what's being done about it? Not enough from what I can tell. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; POLITICAL MESSAGE FOR THE TIMES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B; BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Jack Burden: The friend of your youth is the only friend you'll ever have. For he doesn't really see you. He sees in his mind a face which doesn't exist anymore, speaks a name... Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty... Jack... that belongs to that now nonexistent face. He's still the young idealist you used to be, still sees good and bad in black and white and men as sinners or saints but never both and feels superior in the knowledge that you no longer can distinguish the two. That's what drives you to it. To try to stick the knife in. There is a kind of snobbery in failure like the twist to the mouth of a drunk.  /// Sadie Burke: The world is full of sl**s on skates.  /// Willie Stark: They fooled you 1,000 times, just like they fooled me. But this time, I'll fool somebody. I'll stay in this race. I'm on my own and out for blood. Listen to me, you hicks! Lift up your eyes and look at God's blessed and unfly-blown truth. This is the truth! You're a hick. Nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself. Listen to me, listen to me! They were going to use me to split the vote. But I'm standing here now on my hind legs. Even a dog can learn to do that. Are you standing on your hind legs? Have you learned that yet? Here it is, you hicks! Nail up anybody who stands in your way. Nail up Joe Harrison! Nail up McMurphy!

2681946,3,B000K2UGXO,"This film had much promise since it has a superb cast and is based on one of America's finest novels. However, in the end, it is disappointing. It is disappointing because the script, dialogue, and narrative plot line fail to give a comprehensive credible armature on which the actors may show their craft. This is the story of Willie Stark, a common man seeking good, who becomes corrupt by power. The story is very loosely based on Governor Huey Long of Louisiana. But it is actually the story of Jack Burden, a newspaper writer, born in old Southern privilege, entranced by Willie Stark's character and populist powers, and willing to betray the class from which he came for the benefit of a man he gradually realizes is corrupt. It is the story of Jack Burden that is problematic for we never can figure out the real motives as to why he would betray his family and family friends for the benefit of a man who has become power hungry and abusive of his powers. But unfortunately, the story and motives of Jack Burden are not the only part of the film that never fully makes sense. We never understand why Willie Stark is being impeached by the legislature. We never understand Willie Stark's appeal to the daughter of a respected of a past governor. We never understand how a hospital scandal reflects on the physician son of this same respected past governor. The plot is fully of holes and unexplained actions. The actors who try to speak in a southern accent fail to pull this off, especially Sean Penn, whose accent is almost unintelligible. With a superb cast, Jude Law does his best with the character of Jack Burden. Anthony Hopkins does a credible job as Judge Irwin. However it is Patricia Clarkson who displays the high point in the acting trade in this film. As a political operative who falls for Willie Stark and then becomes bitter and revengeful, Clarkson is perfect and displays more rage and cunning in her understatements that Sean Penn conveys in his overstatements. I was disappointed. I felt like 30 more minutes of film used carefully to pull the narrative thread together would have improved this film greatly.",1303776000,3,2137,4.716577540106952

2681948,3,B000K2UGXO,"I feel ashamed to say that I have still not seen the original take on this film.  I have not seen the 1949 film which so many claim to be a classic.  I really need to see that.  I will say this though, with as awful as the reviews were for this take I was surprised to actually like it a fair amount.  I didn't see the awfulness that so many critics claimed to be there, but then again, I'm not judging it against anything at this point.

Maybe once I see the 1949 film I'll feel differently.

That said, the film is still flawed and it does lack that special spark that would make it memorable.  It's a film that works well in the midst of the viewing, but it fades rather quickly from memory.

The film follows humble Willie Stark as he rises to become governor of Louisiana.  Reporter Jack Burden witnesses Stark's impending fall, thanks to malicious slander, and Jack fights fervently to clear Stark's name.

The one thing that this film has going for it is the cast.  It is a HUGE cast with big names and some smaller names that turn in impressive work.  The lead, Sean Penn, is one of the films weaker links (the man has a tendency to play too heavily on the gimmicky side of things) but he is elevated by the surrounding cast who underplay enough to make his over-the-top mannerisms seemed slightly more balanced.  I will admit to thinking he went too far in scenes, coming across mentally handicapped, but that is a personal opinion that I know not all will share.  I actually loved Jude Law here.  He really understood the importance of subtlety in delivering his lines in a way that captured the emotional intent of the character.  Anthony Hopkins and Kate Winslet and Patricia Clarkson and Kathy Baker and Jackie Earle Haley were all very well used here.  It is only James Gandolfini who suffers at the hands of his own accent (ugh, it just didn't work).

In the end I must say I liked the film.  It doesn't completely pull itself together and the direction can seem a little one-note, but this glossy production of a gritty tale could have been much worse; that's for sure.",1299024000,,2085,4.425196850393701

Jude Law is also miscast.  He is too self-assured for the crisis of identity the novel's protagonist confronts.

The novel has about 700 pages of riveting dialog.  The screenplay captures none of it and rather leaves it to the film's composer to elicit an emotional response with overused scoring.

I got about 30 minutes into this movie before I finally had to stop it.  The offending incident was when the Gandolfini character is exposed in a speech and to underscore this, he falls into a pigpen.

2681951,4,B000K2UGXO,"Having read many of the prior reviews, I would refer viewers to Robert Penn Warren's novel.  I think it would be difficult to fully appreciate the Sean Penn movie without having read the novel.  And lack of exposure to the novel may account for a good deal of the reviewers' criticisms.

Given that most folks are not willing to delve into a 1940's very long book, I think that the more recent movie is much closer to Warrens story than the 1950's movie.  The themes of universal corruption, observing versus participating, class distinctions, political expediency, lust for power, and the attraction to power are all addressed in the movie, but without the nuance and development provided in the novel.  Obviously.  But the movie does attempt to cover almost all of the main plot points and themes of the book -- not always sucessfully, but close enough to be understandable.

Sean Penn, not my favorite actor, does an surprisingly good job as Willie Stark, although his southern accent can be so deep as to mush out dialog.  His energy and motivation carry the movie.  Jude Law's Jack Burden is quite well acted, except for a drifting accent.  His narrator role is quite well done.  The Stantons, Anne and Adam, played by Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo, are underdeveloped with motivations that are probably not comprehensible without first reading the book.  In fact, the major theme of Anne Stanton's attraction to Willie Stark is not really explained in the movie, but is a major revelation in the book.  And these two characters' accents are all over the place.  If you conclude that I believe a good dialog coach would have helped the movie, you are dead on.

All in all, without having read the book, I probably would have given the movie three stars.  Having read it, I give it a solid four.  With a little refinement and focus, it could have been a five.",1277251200,3,1863,4.718266253869969

None masters the southern accent (Hopkins doesn't even try) with a serious loss of credibility.

2681953,3,B000K2UGXO,"I did not have the chance to see 'All the King's Men' in theaters but watched it on DVD just three months after its theatrical release. I read many scathing reviews and so I went out and purchased the novel by Robert Penn Warren to see what I thought of that American classic. I read it and really enjoyed it and keep coming back to it. Also, I like studying the historical figure of Huey Long so I knew I would have to see the film and judge for myself. I have to say that it was quite good, not great, but good. After having watched it a couple of times I really don't mind whether the accents were spot on or not. I would tell any potential viewer that it would be helpful to have read the novel that this is based on because that will fill in many blanks in the movie.

The movie has good acting. I liked Jude Law's melancholy take on Jack Burden and Sean Penn was quite decent as Willie Stark. Anthony Hopkins was also good as the Judge. But the movie should have been longer or a miniseries. As some previous viewers have stated this story is hard to fit in 2 hours. I agree that 4 hours would have been better but movies that long are rarely made anymore so it would have to have been a miniseries ,maybe for HBO. Also a reader of the novel will also say, ""I can't believe they left that part of the story out!"". But on the whole the movie has a good Southern atmosphere though it should have been set in the 1930s instead of the 1950s, I believe. The DVD has a alternate ending that should have been left in the film because it brings better closure to the characters that you have followed throughout the film instead of the quick theatrical ending. And I have to say that there is a certain scene between Jude Law and Kate Winslet that really captures the spirit and melancholy feel of the novel. The narration might have been used even more since you get to hear some of Warren's fine prose and it helps you identify with Burden.

I think it was a worthy attempt on Warren's legendary novel but just could have been fleshed out even more for the viewers enjoyment.

The DVD has a good short documentary on Huey Long- the inspiration for the story, some deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage. I wish there could have been a director's commentary and/or a commentary by someone comparing the movie with the book. For someone interested in seeing more on Huey Long I would recommend Ken Burns excellent documentary on Long which is also available on DVD.

The picture quality of the DVD is excellent as is the sound.

I recommend checking this movie out and deciding your own opinion on the film.",1256169600,,2612,4.322448979591837
2681954,3,B000K2UGXO,"Reading Robert Penn Warren's 1946 novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-King-s-Men-2006-Movie-Tie-In-Edition/dp/0156031043/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the King's Men  [2006 Movie Tie-In Edition</a>] is like riding an academic roller coaster through early twentieth century politics. The narrator, Jack Burden, is a student of history, and his journey through life illustrates the character of Willie Stark, the Boss, the Governor of whichever southern state it actually takes place in. Burden's narration is lush, vivid, and sometimes bogs down in its own detailed prose as it describes the landscapes and peoplescapes, even delving into philosophical ramblings about the meaning of a specifically placed finger or a supposed wink.

The book, frankly, borders on genius. It's a difficult read, sure, but it's a great story. It's the narration and description that makes it so good, though, not necessary the story itself. We come to know the characters only through that narration, but they are fully realized by the end.

The 2006 movie doesn't have those strengths. It tries to make a standard story out of the difficult prose and narrative. Not that it makes the novel strictly linear, but it leaves out all of the interesting philosophical meanderings. Jude Law (Jack Burden) tries to insert some of the stuff about the Friend of your Youth (one of the philosophical inserts) into the movie, but it falls flat because we don't get enough of it to fully appreciate it. All of the characters are that way, too: they're all one-sided, even bordering on stock characters.

We do see some brilliance in Sean Penn's Wille Stark, however, at least when he is giving speeches. When he comes out of his shell and attempts to connect with the world, his speeches are good. Watching this movie in 2009 is a strange experience, however, for we have seen the inauguration of Barack Obama, whose speeches sometimes mirrored those of Willie Stark, although his aren't nearly as mean-spirited. Stark represents the new kind of politician that cares for the people and wants to get rid of money-riddled politics. Instead, he wants to do good, even though he will still use corruption, for it is only through bad that good can ever come (at least according to Stark).

We have some good themes here, but most of them are minor. The primary theme is about the purpose of political life and whether politics can remain above the fray. The movie hints that politics is about service, but it cannot be above anything. Instead, it is as debased as any other human endeavor. Therefore, the very nature of political service is debased.

I'm not sure if the movie can be appreciated without having read the novel, for the plot gets a bit confusing, but the theme about politics and service is still evident. Watch it for that alone, but only if you generally vote Democrat. I guess a Republican can enjoy it, too, for it points out that even ""idealists"" are flawed and are really just as corrupt as any politicians.",1237334400,,3047,5.157894736842105
2681955,3,B000K2UGXO,"ALL THE KING'S MEN (1949) is certainly one of the best movies about American politics ever produced.  Adapted by director Robert Rossen from Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which was inspired by the career of Louisiana's demagogue  governor, Huey Long, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Broderick Crawford) and Supporting Actress (Mercedes McCambridge).

When I first heard that Columbia Pictures was going to remake this classic film, I thought they were nuts.  After all, no matter how good the new version might be, it would always be competing with the memory of the original which is shown regularly on TV and is also available on DVD.

Despite a stellar all-star cast and a handsome production, the 2006 remake of ALL THE KING'S MEN was met with a mixed, often negative, critical reaction and flopped at the box-office.

Nevertheless, I wanted to judge this film for myself.

The good news is that writer-director Steven Zaillian's film is not the total disaster that some critics have labeled it.  It has many strong points and is definitely worth a look.

The bad news is that it is not as good as the original 1949 version.

The 1949 film was neither time, nor place, specific, but this new version does an excellent job in recreating Depression-era Louisiana.  It is also closer to Warren's original book than was Rossen's screenplay.

Among the more memorable performances are Jude Law, as Jack Burden, the role originated by John Ireland in 1949, Patricia Clarkson as Sadie Burke (the Mercedes McCambridge role) and Jackie Earle Haley as Sugar Boy, Governor Willie Stark's bodyguard.

Aside from a sometimes sluggish pace, the movie's main failing is the miss-casting of Sean Penn in the central role of Willie Stark.

Penn is one of our finest actors and he does his best in this assignment, but he, unfortunately, lacks the charisma that Crawford brought to the role in the original.

Penn's Willie is just not likable, and I don't see how he could convince his constituents to vote for him.

Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, James Gandolfini, Kathy Baker and Mark Ruffalo are also in the cast.

2681956,5,B000K2UGXO,"It may be that judgment colored the comments of most reviewers but whatever colored them, the negative comments are washed away by superb acting and an overwhelmingly fine presentation of a place, era, and way of thinking probably foreign to most viewers, even from the U.S.

Very possibly, as reviewer El Lagarto points out, a central problem is also ""the iconic nature of the source material,"" namely, the biography of corrupt populist Louisiana governor, Huey ""Kingfish"" Long---the man who called himself a ""hick"" and rose up by addressing other ""hicks""---many of whom had never voted before. I blush to tell, I've never read the famed Robert Penn Warren novel on which this film is based.

But the movie perfectly captures the oppressively hot, humid Louisiana climate, along with the perennially corrupt political environment that endured throughout the 20th century and into our own era. It also precisely frames the grand antebellum plantation houses, wide lawns, live oak-lined dirt drives and swamps of south Louisiana, where the population is concentrated---along with the decadence for which New Orleans, from its very establishment, has always been deservedly renowned.

The Willie Stark that Sean Penn manufactures is a Huey Long-look alike, and is totally believable. He has the accent, the swagger, and the deep south dead pan down cold, along with the ability to spin a highly colorful yarn based on a highly colorful southern analogy. There's no modern politics in this part. It's late 1920s and early 1930s Louisiana, the whole way. In context.

That's undoubtedly another problem for most viewers. The environment established so firmly in this amazing political story is that it is so foreign to that of current-day U.S. population centers. Apparently,  few people can believe that anything like it ever existed in the U.S. But Louisiana has always been something of a world unto itself, and this was especially true during the Huey Long era.

The actors, listed above, all contribute to the full-scale replication of that complex world, where a gentleman's honor and appearance account for almost everything. Most of the main characters (good guys and bad, alike) thus live beyond the reach of morality---power-hungry, afflicted with alcoholism, or eternally laboring to hide their personal shame or dirty laundry.

This film's negative reception was totally unwarranted. Overall, it's an amazing dramatic accomplishment. For more than two hours, the movie held us rapt in another time, and a thoroughly fascinating place.

There is a scene where Burden bring Stark to Hopkins' house and Hopkins gives Law this look that in very memorable. It was kind of like ""How or why could you bring him here."" I agree with a lot of the criticisms. Was it really necessary to have Kate Winslet shot like an angel or something? There is nothing bad about her performance though. The idea of representing Stark's political corruption through his personal life and not by signing any dirty deals was not the right thing to do. The movie doesn't let you go into how Stark got corrupt. You are told that he is going to put the fall on Ruffalo but you are never shown that.

What I also thought was good was the scene where the hospital opens and Stark gives a really gung ho speech. That score was excellent as was Sean Penn. I liked when he brought Ruffalo out to raise his hand. I can see why they would break that up and make it a pivotal scene because it was great.

In the original ATKM the scene where Stark is shot is very shocking and there is a scream that makes the scene feel very real, in this version the color is drained from the scene and its in slo-mo and it's all very studied and calculated lacking the originals shock value.",1221004800,,1351,4.294117647058823

To fully appreciate this movie, the viewer might first read R. Penn Warren's pulitizer prize novel. Warren always struggled with plot lines--and perhaps this version ties all the stray threads together a little too neatly. The point, however, is that all the plot changes work both dramatically and thematically--they're not gratuitous. A first class production with an amazing cameo by one of our greatest unknown actors Frederick Forrest as Willie's father.

2681967,4,B000K2UGXO,"I can understand some people thinking Penn's performance is too over-the-top, but I think they miss the point. He is intentionally over-the-top and plays it so perfect that I forget it's Sean Penn. The character is nothing like anything Penn has done before which means he is intentionally playing him that way. And the man the character was based on is renowned for being the most flamboyant politician ever to make it that far in politics - to this day!

I admit I had to watch the film twice to fully appreciate it, and upon my second viewing gained a better opinion of it. And I imagine when I watch it a third time (after a few months on other things) I may move my vote up to 5 stars.

The only thing holding back 5 stars right now is that I wasn't entirely satisfied with Jude Law's accent being ""born and raised"" in Louisiana. Yes, we all know he is English, but if he couldn't do the accent proper all the time (he does at times but not consistently) then why give him the role? To his credit, I can't imagine the role played by anybody else. I just wish he had a better coach or more time to master the accent.

Kate Winslet was beautiful and played her small role extremely well. I am almost surprised she would even take on such a small role. That's one actress without an ego problem.

Perhaps the best was (unsurprisingly) Anthony Hopkins, who always delivers. He played the big judge in an endearing and believable way. I won't spoil it by saying what happens to his character, suffice to say that I felt for him very much.

The score was not over played as so often is the case these days. The emotions were all natural and authentic from the story.

I think the director could have made some better editing choices, and perhaps polished the screenplay a bit but overall a fine film with excellent performances all around.

Certainly one of the most underrated - it deserves at least 4 stars compared to some of the crap around here with 5!

Give it a chance if you like thinking movies with meaning.

Oh, the special features are great too and they alone could push my rating to 5 stars. But I reserve that rating for perfect, flawless (in my mind) films. Sadly this one falls just short.",1212019200,,2205,4.398034398034398

2681970,3,B000K2UGXO,"""All the King's Men"" is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel written by Robert Penn Warren.  Warren, who shifted from poetry to prose to write this novel, got his inspiration from the Populist Louisiana politician, Huey Long.

The film, based on a screenplay by Steve Zaillian, is also based in Louisiana.  The politician, Willie Stark (Penn), runs a parallel course to Long's illustrious career. He started out meaning well and his interest was always in the common man, 'hicks' like him. The story is narrated by newspaper reporter, Jack Burden (Law) who works for Sparks.

There's a lot of strong messages in ""All the King's Men."" You can watch it from the perspective of a soap opera, a parallel to contemporary politics (the discussion of the oil companies' influence, for example) or an Ivory Tower comparison to Machiavelli.

This film could have been great, had they decided a few aspects differently.  To quote the film itself:  ""You only get a couple of moments that determine your life. Sometimes only one. And then it's gone. Forever.""  Probably the worst decision the directors made was changing the timeframe the film is set in.  If you ignore that the film's set twenty years past Long's time, it works a lot better. I don't agree with the decision that the 50's are interchangeable historically with the 30's.",1206835200,10,1330,4.901785714285714

The scene was superbly written and acted.  It captured the innocence of teenage boys and girls attempting to engage in sex for the first time...but affraid to actually go through with it.

Other than that well written sequence, the rest of the film bothered us tremendously because of the poor sound quality particularly when Sean Penn was speaking with his over the top southern accent.  He sounded like he had mush in his mouth and in a film of this level of dialog and dramatic events, it was troublsome to say the least.

Regarless...the film had some compelling parts to it and it kept us interested in the final outcome.

2681975,2,B000K2UGXO,"What do Sean Penn,Jude Law and James Gandolfini have in common? Answer:they are all decent actors who to a man could not effect a Southern accent to save their lives (or this film).

ATKM is based on the much better, much older film of the same name that told a fictionalized account of a Louisiana politician based on Governor and later U.S Senator Huey Long. Long was an interesting figure, and while many still disagree on whether his poliices were salvation or destruction, his short career was undeniably very interesting. Long's corrruption is not disputed however, and ATKM follows Long (""Willie Stark"" here) as he rises to power, abuses power and ultimately falls.

James Carville, who is a decent speaker, co-produced this mess. He would have been so better suited himself for the title role, because to listen to Sean Penn painfully abuse the Southern dialect, or Gandolfini who most of us still relate to as a Soprano lean forward and confide in an Amos and Andy patois, it's absolutely unwatchable. I don't know why it'd be so hard to recruit say Billy Bob Thornton, Tommy Lee Jones or any other player who could have been natural in this role instead of so obviously out of place as the cast of ATKM.The casting here is comparable to putting Jackie Chan in the Don Corleone role of ""The Godfather"".

Huey Long was, absent his faults, a great orator and a very charismatic personality. Even with the help of a bombastic soundtrack, Sean Penn sounds like- well an actor. Like DeNiro and many other great performers, Penn cannot in deliver a speech effectively in public out of role and brings no inspiration here. Penns speeches lack charm and radiate nothing but anger as if he has projected his own beliefs of what the working class wants into his role.

THis film really deserves 1 star because of how bad it fails, and I'd send anyone looking into the story toward the original. It's a great tale that could use repeating in this time of ""promise-the-world"" phony populists like Hugo Chavez (curiously a Penn ally) as well as a few presidential candidates stateside I won't name here. Though we are certainly not in the Great Depression, the notion of politician as ""man-of-the-people"" who is an economic saviour is still a popular theme that consistently leads to more gov't and as always with more gov't- more corruption and LESS FREEDOM.

Sean Penn is good but succumbs to over-acting at times, gyrating furiously when it isn't necessarily called for in a scene. I understand that he is channeling Huey Long, but I find the best acting has some subtlety and Penn doesn't demonstrate enough in his performance.
All of that aside, it is a well made movie for the most part. The novel is so extraordinary that you'd have to really screw it up to make a bad movie, and director/writer Steven Zallian shows enough love and respect for Warren's masterpiece to prevent a disaster. The book is far too long and deep to ever lend itself to a satisfying motion picture, but if you can put your knowledge of the book aside (for those who have read it), you can find enough to enjoy.

Huey Long, who Stark is based on, came to power in the grips of the Great Depression which explains why he built all those roads and bridges and the University and new capital. I think Steven Zaillian tried to be faithful to the book. He included scenes explaining the relationship between Jack Burden and the others at Burden's Landing, but they were choppy. He also doesn't do as good a job explaining Willie Stark before be became the power thirsty man that he turned in to. Patricia Clakrson's character is also wasted in this version. I'm glad the producers included the deleted scenes on the dvd release. They fill in a lot of the gaps and I just can't understand why they were ever left out in the first place. For example, the scenes explain what drove the doctor to shoot Stark. You find out that Tiny planted the seeds. Why was this scene deleted from the theatrial version? One other criticism is that it is difficult at times to understand Penn and some of the dialogue. I almost needed subtitles.

2681984,2,B000K2UGXO,"The movie didn't have budget enough to do justice to Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men.

The writer-director is new at the game and it shows.

Sean Penn either weighs 240 pounds in the movie or is padded to appear as though he weighs that much. Penn gives a scenery-chewing performance that is so overwrought it unbalances the film. His hairdo puts me in mind of the one Eric Blair AKA George Orwell wore in his heyday.

Trouble is, the hairdo features white sidewalls around the edge. So when Penn as Willie Stark puts on a fedora, as he often does in the film, he is not recognizable as the same Willie Stark sans hat. Its a major gaffe. A more seasoned Director would have found a way around this.

Penn indulges himself in wild gestures even when talking to the person right next to him.

Stark blows his stack throughout the film. The other performances are more low key, so the Willie speeches jar the audience and undo the quieter moments in the film.

The accents. Sean Penn's Willie is impossible to understand for the first third of the film. Jude Law's Jack Burden the reporter, is only a shade off his usual British accent. Not really American. Willie is romancing his woman aide Virginia Clarkson, in addition to his wife, a skater-stripper, and the Judge's daughter. The judge's daughter is played by Kate Winslet. She's an Aussie. The Judge is played by Anthony Hopkins. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) has a thankless role as a political handler. Both Winslet and Hopkins are totally understandable but not particularly Louisiana accented. Patricia Clarkson is FROM New Orleans, but doesn't particularly have an accent.

The screenplay is a mess. There is no time for Willie to actually have the romances with the women. They are only alluded to. What is really missing though is a sense of the crowd, the base of any political film. Willie is never down among them, always above them talking over their heads. You have to hear something representative from the crowd to know what they're thinking. Apart from some sour looks, the film never gives a sense of who the voters are. The film needs to be opened up in the way stage-locked plays often are when converted to movies.

Instead of being a movie about a gargoyle in Louisiana politics, this film instead becomes a story about an insular group of political people infighting and romancing one another. The film lacks the necessary sense of the crowd that brings politics alive.",1181001600,4,2454,4.730679156908665

I have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a `populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the `little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George  Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of `little people' or anyone else, for that matter.

The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially nave country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do `good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the `people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience Crawford wins this duel. View both films and you decide.",1176854400,,2040,4.757062146892656

The cast is top shelf with Sean Penn's version of the lightly veiled career of the Kingfish, Senator Huey Long. It is narrated by a reporter, turned trusted advisor, Jack Burton played very well by Jude Law. The cast even includes a smaller role by Anthony Hopkins as a judge & surrogate father to Jack Burton as a child. The time frame has been changed to the 1950's & it is remake of a movie from a novel, not real life so playing fast & loose with the facts are permitted. Stark's thrist for power knows no bounds & he runs amok. He comes to grief like the original. Sean Penn is one of those actors who rarely has a poor performance. Some of his movies aren't so great but he usually is. He & Anthony Hopkins many times rise above the movie they are in. Like this one. Most remakes don't rise above the orginals. Like this one. A good, not great movie. But do see the 1949 version & compare. It is great.",1176854400,,1056,4.258706467661692
2681989,2,B000K2UGXO,"Even a stellar cast made up of some of the finest talents in the business - Sean Penn, Jude Law, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, Kate Winslet and Anthony Hopkins - can't save ""All the King's Men"" from being a tired, pointless remake of the Best Picture Oscar winner of 1949.

Robert Penn Warren based his original novel on the life and career of the notorious Huey Long, aka ""The Kingfish,"" who served as governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932.  Like Long, Warren's main character, Willy Stark, is a charismatic leader who offends the powers-that-be with his populist rantings, yet eventually becomes as lowdown, vile and corrupt as the politicians he initially railed against to get himself elected.

This theme of the corrupting influence of power - and the corrosive effect that corruption has on the American political system - may have seemed fresh and insightful in Warren's day, but it is strictly old hat today.  Moreover, in Steven Zaillian`s pretentious rehash, Stark transitions from being an idealist to a cynic in such record-setting time that the audience is completely at a loss as to how to read the character.  Is he a man genuinely committed to helping his fellow citizens who eventually loses his way, or is he just another snake-oil salesman from the get-go exploiting the gullibility of the masses to get what he wants?  The film doesn't seem to know, and the audience, quite frankly, doesn`t really care.

Stunningly, the movie is helped not one whit by its strictly A-list caliber cast.  Penn hams it up shamelessly as the over-the-top Stark, spewing spittle and bile, regardless of whether he is whipping a downtrodden audience into an emotional frenzy or plotting the downfall of his manifold political rivals.  Law, on the other hand, underplays to the point of catatonia the part of the governor's idealistic assistant (and narrator of the tale) who sells his soul to the devil by doing Stark's dirty work for him, even going so far as to blackmail the very man who raised him, in order to prevent the governor from being impeached by the state senate.  Clarkson, Gandolfini, Ruffalo and Winslet do little but stand around in the wings waiting for something dramatic to happen (as do we all), and Hopkins is simply too lazy to go through the trouble of even attempting a Louisiana accent let alone perfecting one.  The movie definitely could have used some serious paring down from the original storyline, since it is stuffed to bursting with characters who come and go seemingly at random, and whom we really couldn`t care less about.  To add insult to injury, James Horner's original music, with its overemphatic underlining and theater-rattling crescendos, should be studied in film schools as a model of how NOT to score a motion picture.

This movie doesn't hold a candle to such superior political dramas as ""The Best Man,"" ""The Candidate,"" ""The Distinguished Gentleman"" and, yes, even the original ""All the King's Men,"" which boasted the incomparable Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge in the lead roles.  Despite its coming from a simpler time, there was fire and passion in that version of the tale, two elements that are sorely lacking in this meandering, lethargic and undercooked remake.",1176854400,9,3255,4.981549815498155
2681990,2,B000K2UGXO,"Astonishingly uninteresting. Maybe there's a way to update the 1947 Broderick Crawford political drama based on Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, but this ain't it. A meek attempt to examine totalitarianism when all social and charitable concern is forced under the wing of a governing body, is buried under mounds of verbal mumbo-jumbo that fills in the holes of skittish characters and situations, and sometimes the mumbo-jumbo remains just bewildering; Jude Law, as Penn's right hand man - ""When we first met, did you wink?"", and Penn's reply, ""I don't remember, maybe I just blinked."" And maybe the script just stinks. Sean Penn, as a naive turned corrupt southern politician, quickly becomes a parody of the Huey Long-type character he portrays, and strangely, begins to resemble Freddie Krueger from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. This film was cold, detached and irrelevant, like skimming a book as opposed to reading one.",1175558400,4,953,5.235294117647059
2681991,1,B000K2UGXO,"""All The King's Men"" is a total mess and a spectacular misfire, a movie so poorly crafted by writer-director Steven Zaillian - who's directed some decent films - that it's not even fun to skewer. The acting is so arch and absurd, the story is so rootless and confusing and endless, droning, awful music is so melodramatic, that  it mostly earns, mostly, our pity.

Based on Robert Penn Warren's novel - itself based on the life of Louisiana politician Huey P Long - the movie uses narrator journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) to follow a backwoods orator named Willie Stark (Sean Penn) from county official to powerful governor. Stark is a populist, relying on his ""hick"" voters to give him carte blanche to redistribute government funds to public works projects - roads, schools, hospitals.

As ""All The King's Men"" opens, Stark is about to be impeached by the state legislature. For what? It's never made clear. Zaillian treats Stark like Jay Gatsby - nobody's quite sure of the truth. Instead of details, we get allusions and random subplots involving Jack's childhood friends (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo) and surrogate father (Anthony Hopkins). All three play a role in Stark's fate, but their characters are ciphers. None of the performances are memorable.

As Stark, Penn has two speeds. He's either a screamin bleeder, his voice breaking and his face ready to pop, or he's sleepily drawlin like he just ate a pan of cornbread. Stark speaks almost entirely in homilies, even in private moments. Penn's talent, which is turning the emotions of a role inside out, doesn't fit the role. He's bought too far into the myth of the guy.",1174608000,7,1636,4.853046594982079
2681992,4,B000K2UGXO,"A brilliantly acted movie with an exceptional script and direction.  The only failing I personally found is that at the end I felt no sympathy for Sean Penn's character even though he had lost all his hopes, dreams and integrity over the term of the movie and thus should have been a tragic figure.",1174348800,,298,4.518518518518518

Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it.",1173312000,7,434,4.37037037037037
2681994,4,B000K2UGXO,"All the King's Men is not, like Joyce's Ulysees, unfilmable.  But almost.  Penn Warren's original is a philosophical novel, something most viewers today, even those with degrees, have not been taught was ever created in this country.  It is not only about political power, but about time and the matrixes in lives when things are briefly possible, and when they never are again.  It is also about the responsibility of the Citizen, embodied by Jack Burden, in a democratic republic.  Finally, it is an extrapolation of issues raised by the career of Huey Long -- but not a transparent telling of his story.  Its much freer than that.

All of the above present difficulties enough for the film maker.  Add to all that what is really an eccentric time and place.  No, Louisiana is too unique a place, then or ever, to stand for America without serious reservations.  It is through a glass very darkly.  Then you have the an era of extreme underground unease that the Roosevelt presidency and WW2 finally subsumed, more or less.  In the face of all these problems, the glib dismissal and put down of this film -- not only on this website but in national journals -- is quite amazing until you realize how fundamentally little has changed in this country, on a certain primal level.  Best way to approach the movie is to put all of that out of mind, and be grateful to live in a nation that can produce this fine a commentary on itself.

The main strategy was to simplify the story; it had to be.  The film's Willie Stark is less complex than Warren's, who was a lawyer and rose to power somewhat more cunningly, and actually closer to certain aspects of Huey Long.  The film uses the lingering popular impression of Long.  It also simplifies the machine of his downfall, here greatly related to booze.  Now one familiar with the problems sees a big early knockout in the works, not a snowball's chance in hell, but then an incredible thing occurs:  a great actor named Sean Penn steps into the role.  And after the first microsecond on film, entirely disappears into the role.  That, and the director's supreme care for cultural authenticity, quickly moves things along as the depression era county auditor Stark immediately sets out for the governership.  The thing is so damn authentic that you can hardly catch some of the dialogue -- which is, yes, irritating.  Perhaps Mel Gibson's recent experiments in ancient language movies have started something.  Something, finally, a little silly.  20th century American realism, after all, was wedded always to basic comprehensibility, whether in literature (ie. Hemingway), painting (ie. Hopper), or film (ie. Huston).

Jack Burden's story has also been simplified, as is that of his friends from Burden's Landing.  I found myself arguing with all this until I saw the edited out scenes in the extras.  They were closer to the novel, but still were not enough for closure. I have to say that even if they would have added an hour to the movie (Penn Warren devotees wouldn't mind) a certain degree of battlefield surgery was still going to be called for at some point.  There was no way around it.  Unfortunately something critical falls through the hole of the 120 minute cut.  The main problem is that Jack's philosophical issue as a man and Citizen does not dovetail properly with Stark's. The major connecting thread in the plotline, of the wellborn physician Adam, is left cryptic, how time and ambition squeeze him out and turn him into a knee jerk killer.  This -- not Stark's power -- is the real horror of the story.  Penn Warren was deeply suspicious of the ""man of idea,"" and shallow assertions of political idealism.  He indeed laid the American civil war as a sacrifice to that particular altar.  But to do even a fraction of this properly it would likely need be long as the Russian version of War and Peace.  As we all know, our young nation still does not take its history or art as seriously as that; we would find a full and proper take on this great book intolerable.

Yet enough remains to put this effort into the very small category of major films made from American literature.  There is much in it worth seeing again.  I cringe only giving it four stars, knowing Penn Warren and knowing all the difficulties tackled head on by this director and cast.  Yet this slavish bowing to the assumed national diminished attention span with 120 minute movies has to stop somewhere.  Why not just shoot a couple more scenes, put back the cuts, and re-release it?  Admit the mistake and bow to the greater cause?  It is all here but the major connections, and you just cannot do that with major literature.  As another American writer put it, if you get into the ring with Dr. Tolstoy, expect to get knocked on yer butt.",1172793600,4,4776,4.688701923076923
2681995,3,B000K2UGXO,"Sean Penn is a fine actor, no doubt one of the best we have in movies today; however, in this film I feel that he relies on facial contortions rather than movements emanating from a deep core understanding of the man he plays, i.e. Willie Stark or Huey Long, to communicate his character.",1171843200,,288,4.452830188679245
2681996,4,B000K2UGXO,"If you read the magnificent novel upon which this film is based, then you see that the movie does a pretty good job of bringing the story to the screen.  Also, I am familiar with hicks in Louisiana, and a lot of them DO have the same accent Sean Penn assumed in his role.

The only improvement I could suggest would have been more frequent use of Robert Penn Warren's own dialogue.  For instance, when Burden criticized Stark for boring his listeners, for showing them pie graphs and talking statistics and finances, he was brief and low-key.  In the book, Burden railed at Stark -- ""Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry, pinch them in a soft spot, but for God's sake don't try to improve their minds.""  Several other instances occurred where the author's exact wording would have worked better.

Also, two interesting book story points were omitted:  Stark's boy, the football player, toward the end was injured during a play and paralyzed from the neck down; Lucy resigned the rest of her life to caring for him.  Also, in the end, Jack Burden and Anne Stanton finally married, fulfilling their destiny from youth.  It made a good wrap-up.",1170633600,15,1133,4.653266331658291

2681998,4,B000K2UGXO,"I for one strongly disagree with the critics and most reviewers of this underrated film.  I finished watching this movie last night and thought to myself ""what gives"" for it was far from the train wreck most would have you believe it is.  I for one and utterly shocked at the lukewarm reception this movie has received and feel it deserves much more credit than it's receiving.

Boasting an impressive cast, `All the Kings Men' for the most part capitalizes on that asset.  Sean Penn of course has taken most of the praise dished out and that's due to his charismatic scene stealing performance as Willie Stark, the humble man who rises from the ashes to become the governor of Louisiana.  While I feel Penn is a gifted actor I still find his performance a bit over the top at times.  My wife even pointed out the fact that he falls a bit into his `I Am Sam' performance at times and comes off a bit...mentally handicapped.

The real star of the film in the correct sense of the term is Jude Law who not only narrates but also appears in the bulk of the scenes.  His portrayal of reporter Jack Burden is subtle and calm, and to me the most controlled of the bunch.  As a man who witnesses first hand the rise and impending fall of Stark we see Jack battle himself as he works fervently to clear Stark's name of slander.  This involves betraying Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), the man who practically raised him but who is a strong will leader in the fight against Stark.

Along the way Jack is reunited with two acquaintances of his past, a former lover and former friend.  Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) was once the apple of Jack's eye, and in many ways still is, but she has quickly become smitten with Stark and his rise to power.  Her brother Adam, Jack's former best friend, is a supporter of those against Stark, but when Stark request Adam head his new hospital he has no choice by comply.  As the fight for power corrupts even those closest to Stark the inevitable does happen and we're left wondering how something so right could go so terribly wrong.

The film is littered with strong acting on the parts of the majority of the cast.  Kate Winslet is brilliant as ever, hiding her accent perfectly and displaying more emotion in her few scenes (she's regrettably horrendously underused here) then most actors can in an entire film.  Patricia Clarkson is wonderful (such a brilliant actress) as is Kathy Baker and Jackie Earle Haley in their small but memorable roles, but my one complaint is James Gandolfini whom I normally love but failed to hide his `Sopranos' accent enough to come off anything more than comical.

Steven Zaillian should also be singled out for his brilliant direction here.  The film was above all else beautiful to look at, the scenery and the surroundings were rich and enticing.  Sure it's got it's flaws, but they are minor compared to the plentiful good points of this film.  From the acting to the script to the masterful camera work, `All the Kings Men' is a film to see, one of the best underrated films to come out this year!",1170028800,3,3064,4.544626593806922

2682000,1,B000K2UGXO,"A lot of hype surrounded the opening of this film in Louisiana, as it was both filmed and  set here (even though Robert Penn Warren's book wasn't set in any particular state).  The story, of course, parallels the political life of Louisiana's ""Kingfish"", Huey Long.  Just in case we couldn't figure that out, Longalike populist Willie Stark sings Long's theme song ""Every Man a King"", and the final scene plays out on the bronze map of Louisiana that's set in the floor of the State Capitol.  Louisiana history notwithstanding, the movie is a dreadful bore, almost all shot in half-light, and mused rather than spoken by the actors other than Sean Penn, who senses the great overacting possibilities inherent in playing Stark.  Some here in Louisiana said that the style was true to Warren's downbeat book  Others, including a Warren scholar and my 13-year old daughter, shared my opinion.",1168819200,7,889,4.932885906040268

This movie has terrific potential and combines a brilliant novel and a stellar cast, but unfortunately it misses the mark by having a script which plays the same note throughout.

2682002,2,B000K2UGXO,"I think the responsibility for this failure lies with mainly 3 people.

First of all, Sean Penn, whom I respect as a great actor (e.g. Mystic River, 21 Grams), but not in this terrible performance. His portrait of a populist demagogue is just too much over the top towards a caricature of Chaplin's great dictator.

Second, the script writer. It can not be that easy to foul up an essentially good story so badly. There is no narrative drive.

Third, this must be Jude Law's worst film ever. He is not an obvious miscast, one can initially believe his character, the young man from an elite background and his mutual attraction with the vulgar politician. But in the course of the plot, the motivation of his character loses ground, and Law is at a loss for adequate facial expressions. He makes a mess of it.

2682003,4,B000K2UGXO,"Before it was released, ""All the King's Men"" was thought to be a front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. The scathing reviews it received from critics quickly put that dream to rest and probably caused the film to lose a big chunk of its potential audience. Sad, since it's actually a really good movie. I've never read the book by Robert Penn Warren or seen the previous film version of it, so maybe it's not as good as those...But this film has an energy all it's own. Sean Penn gives an Oscar-worthy performance (although some parts feel as if he got confused about whether he was in this movie or ""I Am Sam"") as Willie Stark, a Louisiana ""hick"" trying to do some good for his community. When he's tapped to run for governor of the state, he does and wins, promising to do good for the poor people. Immediately, the rich people don't like him...It only gets worse, once he slowly begins slipping into corruption. Jude Law plays Jack Burden, a reporter who is hired by Stark to do pretty much anything he needs. When Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins, who doesn't seem to care whether his accent is fading in and out) calls for an impeachment on Stark, Stark sends Jack to dig up dirt on the old judge...This brings Jack back in touch with his friend Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Adam's sister Anna (Kate Winslet, who also appears with Law in ""The Holiday""), a former love of Jack's. James Gandolfini and Patricia Clarkson co-star. The movie is written and directed by Steve Zaillian, who co-wrote ""Gangs of New York"" and several other films. He gives ""All the King's Men"" an old-timey look to it...Or, at least, one of those pseudo-old timey looks you see in a film like ""The Black Dahlia."" The movie works best when Sean Penn is onscreen. His performance is flamboyant, slightly over-the-top, and full of energy; He proves that he's still one of the best actors around and one of the most fascinating to watch. Jude Law also slips easily into the Louisiana accent and delivers a great performance. A good thing, since he has most of the screentime. Kate Winslet should get an award for the ""worst accent of the year."" For her, the accent really comes and goes. Listen closely enough, you can hear it stop and than come back a few words later. Gandolfini and Clarkson (who don't have enough screentime) got the accents down too, although you can still see a hint of Tony Soprano in James Gandolfini. ""All the King's Men"" is not a perfect film by any means, but it is an entertaining one. It doesn't have Oscars in it's future and will have limited shelf life, but the movie has a unique look and energy to it. There's some damn fine dialogue here and some great speeches and to tell you the truth...I think this film is better than a lot of the movies that made it into Top 10 Lists last year. I know I just said the accents fade in and out, but the performances that are good (And Hopkins and Winslet are good, don't get me wrong) are great! The script is pretty solid, the direction is good, the cinematography is great...There's a lot of reasons to see this movie and you might find yourself surprised by how much you like it.

2682005,2,B000K2UGXO,"This film had something very special going for it with its central casting of Sean Penn as Huey Long, the Kingfisher, the everyman governor of depression-era Louisiana (Willie Stark in the film). If ever there was a role designed for Penn's heated and emotive style of acting, this was it. True to that promise, Penn delivers a few (too few) wonderful scenes with Willie Stark delivering fire and brimstone from the campaign stump.

Other than these scenes, the film is an unformed washout. Willie Stark's transformation from righteous, wife loving common man to manipulative, self-serving adulterous political schemer is . . . .  well there really is no transformation. It simply happens between scenes off camera, rendering a potentially fascinating character, rich with comment about the fallibility of human nature, into a black and white, boring nothing.

The film sort of meanders around with the character of reporter Jack Burden (played by the desperately miscast Jude Law)and his exceptionally average family story, which somehow includes lover Anne Stanton (played by the desperately miscast Kate Winslet) and her brother Adam Stanton, played by Mark Ruffalo (who was at least well cast but left hanging in limbo by some very lazy scriptwriting). On board also is the very talanted James Gandolfini, who must have owed someone a very big favor. I challenge anyone to explain to me what he was doing in this bumbling, mumbling role, so far beneath his station. All in all, I was left wondering how any of the principals managed to convince themselves the product was release-ready when watching the final edit.

Final note to Hollywood: let's strike a deal with England: From this day forth, no cross-accenting. Americans shall not play Brits; Brits shall not play Americans (particularly southerners). I think this simple piece of legislation would do wonders in maintaining good relations with that isle across the pond. Lord have mercy it was painful watching Mr. Law and Ms. Winslet giving it their best. All British actors use the exact same accent for anyone ""southern""; a kind of a generic mish mash of drawl: all at once from everywhere and nowhere.

Burden, from south Louisiana, is the narrator. The aristocracy, the Burdens, Stantons and Judge Irwin, brought down by the people in the personna of Willie Stark. ""All the King's Men"" is a subtle exploration of corruption, not an in-your-face thriller. Read the book, then see the movie. Both are well worth the time.",1167436800,,859,4.843537414965986

The Script was terrible, there was really no story whatsoever and it just didn't make sense! Sean Penn To me is the greatest actor of our generation but this was his WORST PERFORMANCE! Sean's Southern accent was SO BAD that I had to actually turn on the English Subtitles to understand him. This Movie just didn't make sense and was full of holes that were never filled or explained by the movies end(and I CLAPPED when the film FINALLY ENDED)!

2682009,4,B000K2UGXO,"Robert Penn Warren's 1946 Pulitzer Prize winning novel ALL THE KING'S MEN comes to the big screen courtesy of the author and writer/director Steven Zaillian and a dream cast that should make any script blaze across the screen. All of the ingredients of a brilliant film are here, yet areas of fuzzy focus and diluting the ever-present power of the main character so admirably brought to life by Sean Penn  miss the mark to a degree.  How this happened is unclear as all of the individiual aspects of the movie would be hard to improve.

The story is so well known that repeating a plot outline is superfluous.  It is enough to remind the potential viewers that this is the 'quasi-biography' of Huey Long (here called Willie Stark), the hick from Louisana who gained the governorship of the state by empowering the poor and neglected citizenry led by a corrupt government with promises of reform and education, health and jobs for the disenfranchised.  It is his rise to power and eventual decline and assassination that provides the playing field for a varied cast of characters, men and women of varying degrees of honesty on both sides of the political arena.

The story is narrated by reporter cum employee Jack Burden (Jude Law) who is first to show Willie Stark (Sean Penn) that he is a puppet for the corrupt wealthy gentry of Louisiana.  The histories of the powers that be include the judge (Anthony Hopkins), the children of the controlling Stantons (Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo), the woman who would become mistress and informer (Patricia Clarkson) and the mother of Jack Burden (Kathy Baker) who holds the final secret that drives the downfall of Stark and 'all the king's men'.  And in the end it feels as though Jack Burden's role as written for the screenply seems the more important, a factor that diminishes the magnitude of the fall of Willie Stark.

But this is a fine line of criticism.  All of the actors give superb performances: the only problem lies in the too authentic adapted Southern accents that tend to cover the dialogue to the point of disrupting the access to the story being told.  The mood produced by the lighting director, the cinematographer, and the musical scoring are incredibly fine.  And in the end this is a superb film despite its few shortcomings.  Advice: refresh the mind with reading the novel to enhance the understanding of all of the fine points of the story.  Grady Harp, December 06",1166572800,3,2437,4.771428571428571
2682010,4,B000K2UGXO,"""All the King's Men"" has turned out to be pretty much a failure on all levels. The movies cost an estimated 55 millions dollars. It grossed a little more than seven million.[...]

 Why has this film been damned by the critics and the public? When I first heard about this film, I thought it was a sure Oscar contender. In fact it was suppose to be released last year, but was delayed.

 I guess that was when the negative press started to come in. Many people feel if a movie is held back there must be a reason behind it. The reason, it is felt, is usually because the film is bad, but, because the studios put so much money into a film, they went to at least attempt to make some sort of profit.

 Even if this is true I still think there was another reason ""All the King's Men"" failied so miserably. Many people thought the film was going to have a Liberal bias. If you hadn't heard one of the film's executive producers was Democrat strategist James Carville. Plus many people know about actor Sean Penn's political views.

 Because of this, many people thought the film was going to be a love letter to the Democrat party. I believe that's what ultimately hurt the film.

 So what is ""All the King's Men"" about? Was, first of all it was based on a novel by Robert Penn Warner and was adapted to the screen a few times before. Two TV verisons I believe and the most popular verison is the 1949 Oscar winning film.

 So there's a good chance some of you already know the basic story-line. The film revolves around Willie Stark (Sean Penn). A local ""hick"" (his term not mine) who wants to help the working class poor. He's a no nonsense kind of guy, a Mr. Deeds type if you will.

 One day Stark is offered an opportunity to run for Governor of Louisiana, of course with the help of a couple of strong arms headed by Tiny Duff (James Gandolfini).

 At first Stark has no idea he is really being used to split the working-class vote so another candidate can win.

 The film then becomes about Stark's struggle to do good while at the same time fallen victim to the corruption of politics. Especially as Congress is about to vote on whether or not to impeach Mr. Stark.

 Lots of people will say the director, Steven Zaillian, is making, or at least trying to make a political statement about our current times. Even if that was true, so what? People say that like it's a bad thing.

 ""All the King's Men"" has some great acting in it, and not only from Penn, whom really does some Oscar caliber work here. But there is a fine performance from a man we all know Sean Penn thinks is one of our best actors, Jude Law.

 Law plays Jack Burden, the film is told from his point of view, who is a newspaper writer who later works for Stark. And then there Anothy Hopkins as Judge Irwin, a man who starts the impeachmen talks against Stark.

 In fact every performance in this film is wonderful to watch. The directing by Zaillian is good. And camerawork is nice. In general it is a solid, entertaining piece of filmmaking that doesn't deserve the bad rep it is getting.

 ""All the King's Men"" plays with some interesting ideas about corruption and power, has a great performance given by Penn, and worthwhile directing. In short it is one of the better films made this year!

 Bottom-line: Sadly condemned film that deserves a first chance. Sean Penn leads the pack with stellar work as always but the supporting characters are just as fun to watch. A solid enetertaining piece of filmmaking.",1166313600,2,3485,4.408450704225352
2682011,2,B000K2UGXO,"This remake of ""All The King's Men"" is really a very simple story.  I must state that I have seen neither the 1949 version, nor read Warren's original book.  Nevertheless, the movie concentrates on Jack Burden, (Law) a young journalist who covers Willie Stark's (Penn) campaign, and then goes to work for Stark after his election.  As Stark's power multiplies, powerful men in the Louisiana legislature try to impeach Stark.  One of the leaders behind this attempt to dump Stark is Judge Irwin (Hopkins).  Knowing that Irwin is pulling the strings, Stark petitions Burden to do a background check on Irwin.  The results of this fact finding mission rip apart the judge's family, all the while taking a toll on Burden who has a confusing prior relationship with the judge's family.  Eventually, all hell breaks loose as Burden uncovers shady dealings in Irwins past, and the result spells doom to the progenitor of the smear campaign.

That is the spine of the movie, and unfortunately, the Director Zaillain does not delve deeper then that.  Instead of having scenes with the legislators and the Standard Oil men plotting Stark's doom, we instead have a much replayed swimming scene near the Judge's residence.  Instead of Stark taking his message to the people and shaking hands with his fellow hicks, we are treated instead to overwrought scenes of the eccentric Judge Irwin and his family.  Those examples, I would contend, are the ultimate failings of the movie.  However, one would have to assume that if the movie stayed close to the book, then the book would have these same failings as well.  To say I was disappointed by the end result of this movie would be an overstatement, but the movie unfortunately verged towards the more soap opera-like plotlines of Warren's original vision.  This in turn, made the movie sacrifice a more politically vibrant theme which may have made the movie more palatable.",1165276800,3,1911,4.93125
2682012,3,B000K2UGXO,".. and despite the bad reviews, I went.  The mainstream reviewers are right.  Sean Penn is great, but one actor does not make a film.

Some reviewers here praise the script, but I think the problems result from the script.  The Burden character doesn't make sense.  He begins as a cynical reporter.  Why is he, of very upper crust New Orleana, traveling from small town to small town to write stories he says he doesn't care much about?  His impulse to join Stark, if it's about boredom, fits, but this isn't clear.  His descent from being aloof, to his questionable ethics is totally unexplained (or is it meant to be existential?). His romance and the fate of this, which mostly happens off screen, also seems to be random.

Gandolfini looks good in the part, but the part is not well used.  The Hopkins role has too much contrived eccentricity and how Burden arrives at his betrayal of him is unclear.

I give it 3 stars for Penn (who deserves 5), and the attempt to tackle a complicated story.",1164585600,,997,4.544943820224719

Unfortunately though, this film lacks the campy awfulness of that film and substitutes pompous awfulness instead. Watching James Gandofini struggle with his accent does at least have some comic appeal. This film certainly has one of the finer casts put together in some time, but the sum of the parts is far greater than the whole, sort of 12 actors in search of an Oscar. This is indeed Shakespearean in the sense that it is a ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing"", amply illustrated in the final image of the blood of Willy Stark and his killer slowly running through the grooves in the Seal of Louisiana embedded in the floor only to run together.",1163462400,4,800,4.601398601398602
2682016,4,B000K2UGXO,"If The Terminator can become Governor of California, why not Sean Penn? After seeing ALL THE KING'S MEN, he has my non-aligned vote.

Penn plays Willie Stark, an uncorrupted small-town mayor in 1950s Louisiana, who's picked by the political machine, represented by Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini), to run as a wild card candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial race. But, when Willie realizes he's being manipulated, he veers off on his own to become the darling of the electorate's downtrodden and forgotten hicks. Covering the campaign for a major local news rag otherwise sympathetic to Stark's opposition is Jack Burden (Jude Law), whose editorial pieces become so admiring of Willie that he's fired. But, when Stark wins, Burden hires onto the new governor's team as a personal aide and PR hack.

Once in office, Governor Stark antagonizes the state legislature, the oil companies, and the moneyed classes with his share-the-wealth promises to the sweaty masses - so outraged, in fact, that the legislators start serious impeachment talk, a move supported by the admired and retired Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins), who also happens to be Jack's godfather. Eventually, Burden must choose between the loyalty to his immediate boss and his love for Irwin, who served as Jack's surrogate biological father.

One marginally well-known movie critic and media personality pontificating from Chicago - while I hold forth more credibly only scant miles from Tinseltown itself - has charged Penn with overacting his part. Oh, how not so! Sean's Stark carries on in rare form the finest tradition of political demagoguery. What, you think that Hitler and Mussolini, perhaps two of the most effective populist rabble rousers in recent memory, just stood lifelessly at the speaker's podium and mumbled? (Perhaps, after listening to the likes of Dubya and Kerry in the last presidential election, Windy City has forgotten what constitutes crowd-gripping oratory.) Indeed, I expect a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Penn; he's mesmerizing.

I haven't seen the original Big Screen release (1949) of ALL THE KING'S MEN, nor read the book on which both films were based. But this version isn't an unqualified success. While the supporting performances by Gandolfini and Hopkins are eminently watchable, and that of the former perhaps meriting a Best Supporting Actor nod, that by Law and his on-screen love interest, Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet), are notably unmemorable.  Burden, as the detached observer (and narrator) of the story, perhaps carries his uninvolvement too far; even the revelation at the end illuminating his relationship with Irwin leaves him gasping with apparent indifference. And Stanton desperately needed to be erased from the script; she's as unnecessary a plot character as you'll ever not need to see. So, four stars almost solely on the basis of Penn's performance.",1159488000,,2874,5.293859649122807
2682017,4,B000K2UGXO,"Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Louisiana, the mid-50s. Willie Stark (Sean Penn) helps to bring attention to a potential problem in his impoverished home parish in Louisiana. The state's political machine, led by Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) and Sadie Burke (Patricia Clarkson), recognizes this man could become a viable candidate for Governor of the great state of Louisiana and approaches him. Faster than you can shout ""Voulez vous les bonnes temps roulez"", Stark is Governor and he has asked Jack Burden (Jude Law), a local reporter to come to work for him. As they say ""Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely"" and Stark is soon suspected of stealing from the government. An influential retired judge (Anthony Hopkins), who also happens to be Jack's godfather, throws his influence behind the impeachment proceedings, leading Stark to encourage Jack to dig up some dirt. Governor Stark realizes he needs to do something positive for his image, so he decides to build a new medical center. He wants Adam Stanton (Mark Ruffalo), a doctor and the son of a former beloved Governor to run it. As Adam and Jack were friends, Stark asks Jack to enlist his former friend's help. But Jack must deal with his feelings for Adam's sister, Anne (Kate Winslet) as he attempts to keep the political machine rolling.

""All The King's Men"", written and directed by Steve Zaillian and based on the book by Robert Penn Warren, was previously made into a film starring Broderick Crawford as Stark. I have never seen the original, so I am unable to make a comparison. The new version is good, but given the caliber of the actors involved, the writing and the subject matter, you would expect it to be great.

The film has a basic message: Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely.

Power in Hollywood is sometimes represented by who you can get to act in your films. Director Steve Zaillian must have some power because he has assembled a top notch cast. From Sean Penn on down, the cast features a host of actors who have created memorable performances in almost everything they have ever done. As Stark, Penn does a great job of bringing the man's eccentricities and vulnerabilities to light. Full of bravado, Stark soon learns he has a lot of power and doesn't hesitate to use it. Starting out as a local small town whistleblower, he doesn't change all that much when he becomes Governor. He is still loud and full of himself. But as Governor, he realizes people are willing to look past certain things. For instance, his wife (Talia Shire) rarely accompanies him and he takes every opportunity to have affairs, starting with Sadie (Clarkson) who is upset when she learns Stark slept with an exotic dancer. As Stark realizes his power, he becomes more confident in his ability to sweet talk people into doing things against their will. Jude Law is quite good as Stark's right hand man, his Man Friday. Throughout, Stark asks him to do crooked things, yet he soon agrees to most. Law also provides the narration for the film, giving some color and flavor to the proceedings. Kate Winslet is good as Anne, Jack's first and probably only love. There is a development with her character late in the film which seems a little tacked on, but otherwise, she is fine. Gandolfini seems to have fun as a Louisiana politico and Patricia Clarkson is also good as the eye of Stark's affection who becomes upset when he cheats on her. Mark Ruffalo plays the pivotal role of Adam, the doctor and son of a former governor, who plays a part in Stark's plan to reestablish respectability. The one problem in the cast is Anthony Hopkins who...

Corrupts his character by not even attempting a Southern accent. Hopkins is often regarded as one of the best actors working in film today. Yet, in ""All The King's Men"", he is the one actor who doesn't even attempt a Southern accent, retaining his distinct British accent. This wouldn't matter much, but his character is rather bland. It almost seems like Hopkins is going for a characterization the complete opposite of everyone else. He is quiet, calm and reserved when everyone else is over the top. As the story takes place in the mid-50s, in Louisiana, it seems more fitting to have loud bombastic characters. At least characters who seem to have a little life left in them. Every state has some history of corruption in the government, and Louisiana is certainly no exception. It just seems like a quite reserved character is a little out of place in this environment.

Absolutely the best thing about the film is the look. Every scene is filled with saturated colors which perfectly evoke both the feeling of the time and place and also pay homage to the films of this period. Director Zaillian has a real eye for detail and style. He is also a gifted writer, and he creates memorable characters, but the details of the story get a little lost. Also as a director, he has a little difficulty with the actors. They are all good, but given the caliber of this cast, they should be great.

""All The King's Men"" is a good film, and a good way to start of the fall movie season. Hopefully, this is a good sign of what is to come. Hopefully, if the quality continues to rise, we will have one of the best movie seasons in a long time.",1159315200,,5242,4.711014176663031
2682018,5,B000K2UGXO,"Am I the first person here who thinks this movie deserves five stars?  I thought it was great...story, acting, cinematography, almost everything about it.  Of course the book had more detail, but I think this movie did the book justice.  Some of the dialogue is verbatim.  I do feel like something was lost in the story of Jack, Anne and Adam...their connection just didn't grab you. But to be honest, the book didn't say that much about Adam either, so I can understand how he just seemed to be ""dropped"" into the movie to kill Stark. This movie can probably be more appreciated if you read the book first, as so much had to be left out to make a manageable length.  I have found this to be true with a lot of movies made from books. My biggest complaint is Kate Winslet's blonde hair.  She is dark haired in the book, like her brother Adam...in the movie she looks more like Jack than Adam.  The acting is really great.  Sean Penn is incredible as Willie Stark, a self proclaimed ""hick"" who wants to help the poor man.  Unfortunately its the same old story...power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  All the King's Men is supposed to be the story of Louisiana governor Huey P. Long.  However, the author, Robert Penn Warren denied this.  And the book never says Stark is the governor of Louisiana...he is the governor of a ""Southern state.""  One of the best filmed scenes is after Stark is killed, and Stark and his killer both fall on their backs in the middle of the state seal on the floor of the capitol building, with a puddle of blood between them, and thin rivulets of blood radiating from the puddle to both men, connecting them in death as Adam didn't want to be connected to Stark in life.

2682019,4,B000K2UGXO,"MOVIE: I don't know what is up the poopers of all the movie critics nowadays, it's like if it isn't a masterpiece of cinema then it's pure garbage. So many great films this year got horribly trashed by critics including this one. While the film has its flaws, it's in no way as bad as most people say it is. The film is based off of Robert Penn Warren's novel, which makes this the second film (4th overall adaptation including TV movies). The original theatrical adaptation snagged up Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in 1949, so you can expect some opposition in remaking a film that is already considered to be a classic. Steve Zaillian wrote and directed this version of the novel, and to his credit he did an amazing job. The film is incredibly focused and structured very well. He's only directed 3 movies including this one, but he has written some well known and critically acclaimed films including Schindler's List, Gangs Of New York, Hannibal, and The Interpreter. The dialogue in this film is incredibly natural and full of meaning, it flows very well. The characters are all perfect established, but where the film falls short is probably within its subplots as well as overall impact. Willie Starks' speeches are delivered with superb intensity by Sean Penn in some of the finest acting he's ever done. The central storyline of Starks and his rise to power is muddled a bit by many subplots with Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffulo, and Anthony Hopkins. It's hard to start all these storylines and then try and conclude them all in a satisfying manner at the end, and in that area is where the film fails to connect. James Horner's score also seems to be misplaced in certain scenes and it creates an awkward tone. However, to call this film bad is a crime. There is so much beautiful symbolic imagery and great cinematography in the film that it enhances its depth. I did feel like I was getting preached at, as if the filmmakers were trying to make a strong statement about modern day politics, and that draws you out of the whole experience a bit. Overall though this was a decent movie with an amazing cast and some incredible acting. Don't let the bad reviews prevent you from seeing it.

ACTING: The cast of this movie is a dream team. To have a cast of this magnitude is astonishing, and they all just sink their teeth into material. Penn delivers such a strong presence as Willie Stark that you will get chills just from watching him make his speeches. Jude Law gives his character great depth and dimension to help connect his past with the present, but unfortunately the two storylines fail to connect. Anthony Hopkins, Patricia Clarkson, Mark Ruffulo, and Kate Winslet were all great as well. The only person I had a problem with was James Gandolfini. The man just cannot pull off a southern accent, and it threw his scenes off so badly. Otherwise it was a great experience to watch all these great actors interact and play off the intensity of one another.

BOTTOM LINE: The Da Vinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Hollywoodland, and a few other movies had a large amount of critical opposition this year but I loved them anyway. This film has a lot to offer, it's not just some empty-headed drama about politics. Steve Zaillian offers a rich and detailed screenplay with some superb dialogue that flows well. The subplots and lack of a textual impact on the audience hinders the film, but in no way ruins it.",1159142400,25,3444,4.635024549918167
2682020,3,B000K2UGXO,"This film dared me not to like it, and I'm afraid that I'm going to have to take them up on it. While its main reason for existence seems to be to shake its booty at Oscar, this grandiose drama couldn't even manage to impress me. Unfortunately for Steven Zaillian a great story and a great cast does not a great movie make. The film starts off strong as we watch Sean Penn's Willie Stark deliver amazing speech after amazing speech. But after that the story settles down somewhere in Jack Burden's (Jude Law) personal life. The tidiness of great political dramas such as ""Thirteen Days"" is nowhere to be found. Instead, we find a lard filled film that sputters and stalls so much that watching it almost becomes excruciating. Zaillian thought he was making the second coming of ""Citizen Kane,"" but he couldn't even live up to the standards of ""I Am Sam.""

However, I far from hated this film and the main reason for that is Sean Penn. Always great, he delivers a performance here that at the very least is Oscar nomination worthy. Sure the character is over the top, but he is still an absolute joy to watch. Had this film had more of him and less of Jude Law (who I normally like) then maybe it could have been salvaged. Law plays a journalist turned aid to Stark, who asks him to dig up dirt on one of his biggest enemies. The problem, of course, is the deep personal bond Burden feels for Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins). We dig deep (way too deep) into his past, and into his inner conflict. His story arch also touches upon age old themes such as absolute power corrupts absolutely and a man who sets out to change the world only ends up being changed. John McCain, who spent his career as a maverick, has spent the last two years acting like a sell out because that is what the American people like to vote for. McCain, like Stark, might mean well, but if cozying up to the religious right and signing off on the despicable torture bill is his version of changing the world then he has clearly lost his grasp on reality. I bring this up because McCain is the type of politician that this film sets out to examine.

""They want to ruin me, because they want to ruin you"" is the enduring lesson I will take away from this film. And it resonates with me even more because it's spoken by Sean Penn, somebody who is viewed as a threat by the powers that be. People who stand up for people are always ruined in one way or another (Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon), and there is a reason for that. Penn seems to have outsmarted them all because while he plays a politician in the film in real life he is an actor. And as an actor he can make a film like this that will reach far more people then a piece of legislation that would only be quashed by the Republicans in Congress. It's just too bad that this film wasn't any good. The other actors were poorly written, and a few actors (Gandolfini, Ruffalo) were given very little to do. It also felt downright Shakespearean to me. And as with all Shakespeare that means a huge body count, poetic language, heavy lifting, and delusions of grandeur. I just hope that come Oscar night we're talking about Sean Penn and not ""All The King's Men."" **3/4",1159056000,10,3199,4.374789915966386

8154017,1,B000K2UGXO,"Review of All the King's Men
Hot Toasty Rag, December 11, 2017

Ive never seen the original 1949 film, so the 2006 remake of All the Kings Men is my only reference for the story. And while I watched the film in its entirety, if pressed, I wouldnt be able to give you a very detailed plot synopsis. To be blunt, its pretty boring, and none of the characters motivate you to pay close attention.

Sean Penn is an over-the-top Southern politician with dreams of grandeur. Ive never found him to be very trustworthy in his roles anyway, so its not a stretch to believe he manipulates and panders to his audiences and those in his close circle, while hiding his ulterior motives. In tow are journalist Jude Law, girlfriend Patricia Clarkson, and political crony James Gandolfini. James seemed to be on a constant verge of cracking up, Patricia seemed miscast, and Kate Winslet, who got on the promotional poster, has an infinitely smaller part than her counterparts. I don't know why she was cast either, since her role consisted of very little acting, except maybe she, her publicist, or the studio were drawn to cast her for one scene of partial nudity. The big scene in the filmSean Penn is making a political speech and no one is listening to him, so he lays on the heavy religious rhetoric and shouts and gains everyones attention and supportfelt extremely forced and uncompelling. How can the audience get excited about Seans big scene when it feels like it was the fortieth take and everyone was tired and knew what to expect?

While James Horners theme was supposed to sound ominous, all I heard were the similarities to Hans Zimmers music in Green Card, which had an entirely different meaning. All the Kings Men isn't a movie I wish Id never seen, but it was very forgettable and hardly the money that went into it. A Face in the Crowd, a different story but with similar themes, is an infinitely superior film.

8154021,4,B000K2UGXO,"It's amazing how many reviewers here are so focused on the characters, the story line, i.e., the movie, while likely being totally ignorant that this story came from the life of Huey P. Long's 1928 - 1932 term as Louisiana governor. That's where Robert Warren got the story. Huey Long was one of the first governors of Louisiana that actually did more for the people in his one term than many governors before him. He had an element of corruption about him, which anyone paying attention in the early part of the film should have picked up on when Stark outlay-ed his personal philosophy about human nature.

As for the movie, the acting was outstanding; the music score was outstanding; the story which became Warren's later fictional story line for this movie came from Huey P. Long's life and his term as Louisiana governor.",1504137600,,827,4.743055555555555
