8763617,3,B01GUOTIW0,"A mother-in-law who supports her son and his wife and her grandson insists her son choose between being supported by her or separating from his wife, whom she despises. Subsequently, the husband is killed and the mother-in-law gets custody of the child. This is a B movie with an improbable plot with too many coincidences and subpar acting. If you can cringe your way through the acting, the movie is watchable.",1493424000,,412,4.816901408450704
