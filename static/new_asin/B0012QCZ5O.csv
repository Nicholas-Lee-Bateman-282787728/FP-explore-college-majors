After shots are fired and bombs explode,killing virtually no one,the film then rewinds multiple times (and I do mean multiple times) showing the original scene from different ""vantage points"" (hence the title)
I saw this at a free screening and we were informed that this film had been held back for a year. Why? I don't know. I can say that I felt that the Barry Levy screenplay,( a teacher of 3rd and 9th graders,who had his script picked up by Columbia),was dreadful!!!Again, from my ""vantage point"" this film has been done many times before and with much better results and acting. William Hurt,Sigourney Weaver,Forest Whitaker,Dennis Quaid.....Oscar actors wasted. One vantage point is enough. 2 and 1/2-3 stars.",1203724800,2,1806,8.035
3093928,5,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie is unpredictable. I could not guess what was coming until the end.

It has a unique way of telling a story. The plot is unfolded in 4 or 5 different people's points of views.  First, you'll see the motorcade of the president of  the United States arrived at the scene. At about noon, he was shot. Then, a huge explosion occurred at the scene that killed a lot of people. Next, the film was rewinded to 23 minutes earlier. Then it was told in the eyes of a secret service agent, Dennis Quaid. This time the narration stopped about 15 minutes after the president was shot. It showed us what was happening after the explosion. Then the movie was turned back 23 minutes again. This time, it was told in another person point of view. Each time, it revealed a little more about the plot and action. To me, the filming and the technique are very effective. It's very suspenseful.  It keeps my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.

A few critics said the movie lost its momentum because when the climax was about to be reached, the movie was rewinded. Yes, the first time it was done, it irritated me a little but five minutes later I was completely satisfied. It was because more details of the plot were revealed in another person's point of view! Further, the picture moved at fast pace so the rewinding did not cause any boredom.

The special effects are impressive. Especially, the explosion at the Plaza looks very real. It has some twists too.

Somebody said the ending was far fetched. Yes, so are the endings of many other movies. That does not reduce their entertaining values because they are not documentaries.

If you want something different, very thrilling and exciting. This is the film for you. It's the best thriller of 2008, so far. I certainly will buy it when it's released on DVD.",1203724800,3,1826,4.52887537993921
3093929,4,B0012QCZ5O,"As the Bourne series raises the bar for action films, and audiences balk at two-plus hour runtimes, the filmmakers of Vantage Point seem like they are trying to bring a fresh, new, unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.

The new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.

Because of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot. It starts with a TV network covering a large gathering of leaders from all over the world (including the President of the United States) who have come together to form an alliance against the war on terror. At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.

In the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of ""again?!"" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new  in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is ""out of ideas"" they get angry when it tries something ""different"" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.

I felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system. I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.",1203638400,3,2413,4.749403341288783
3093930,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I never once believed that the events of ""Vantage Point"" were possible, but the clever structure and interweaving narratives made for one hell of a fun movie. This is a story that constructs itself out of multiple viewpoints, with characters that witness and/or participate in terrorist activity. To show these viewpoints, the film consistently rewinds itself and then replays, each time focusing on different characters while gradually revealing pieces of the puzzle. I agree that this isn't very realistic, but that doesn't matter since it's more about entertainment. It's a good thing I caught on to that early on, because at a certain point, the convenient twists and implausible action sequences become too numerous to count. The ad campaign claims that eight strangers bear witness, but it's actually hard to know for sure since the segments are very intermingled. You shouldn't be counting, anyway--you'll miss out on everything.

The film takes place in Spain in the city of Salamanca, where the President of the United States plans to take part in an anti-terror summit. A public statement will be given at the Plaza Mayor, where thousands of people have gathered both in support and in protest. Capturing the action for American television is camera director Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver), who demands the best footage from both crew and the reporters. Everything goes smoothly until the arrival of the President, who's immediately shot. Complete chaos ensues, which only gets worse with the sound of a distant explosion. It all comes to a grinding halt when the Plaza Mayor explodes in a gigantic fireball, killing dozens if not hundreds.

At this point, the story rewinds twenty-three minutes earlier, just as it turns noon. We now focus on Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid), a member of the President's Secret Service. Because he took a bullet for the President a year earlier, he's completely unsure of himself, so much so that he relies on an anti-anxiety medication to stay under control. The other guards seem to be just as unsure, especially since he overreacts to people who reach for things in their pockets. His partner, Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox), seems to be the only one that still respects him. As they stand on the stage, Barnes notices a fluttering curtain in a building that was supposed to be cleared. Even after it turns out to be nothing, he's clearly troubled by what he's seen. He then kicks into high gear when the shot is fired; after tackling and losing a man claiming to be a Spanish police officer, and after the explosion, Barnes runs into Brooks' news van and demands to see every moment of footage. He ends up seeing something that shocks him to the core.

The story rewinds again, and this time we focus on Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), a Spanish cop assigned to protect the Mayor of Salamanca. He's also set to meet his lover, Veronica (Ayelet Zurer), although he feels threatened when he sees another man holding her. This is bad because he already feels strange about what Veronica wants him to do. After a quick exchange, Enrique moves into the crowd and witnesses the President being shot. He runs on stage, only to be tackled by Barnes and arrested on the spot. After the explosion, Enrique leads the Secret Service on a chase through the streets, one that ends at an underpass spanning a busy highway. It also ends with him saying ""Surprised to see me alive?"" to an as yet unrevealed person.

Once again, the story rewinds. We now meet Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), an American tourist visiting Europe for the first time. Capturing every moment on a digital camcorder, he walks around Plaza Mayor with awe in his eyes. As the summit gets underway, he notices an odd interaction with a Spanish couple, the kind that says they have something to hide from the rest of the world. He then notices strange activity in the upper floors of a building, which then leads to the President being shot. As panic takes hold, Barnes approaches Lewis and demands to see the footage he shot. Then comes the explosion, which both Lewis and his camera miraculously survive. Even more miraculous is his willingness to chase Enrique and continue recording the events--he seems awfully curious for someone who barely escaped with his life.

I can't describe the remaining viewpoints simply because too much would be given away. I'm sorry to say that one of the biggest plot points was already given away in the trailers, and it relates directly to the President (William Hurt). To those of you who have seen them: you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who haven't seen them: believe me, you're better off. Be that as it may, I was greatly entertained by this film, from its enticing start to its frenetic finish. The final ten minutes of ""Vantage Point"" are fast-paced and satisfying, and they feature a lengthy car chase that's anything but realistic, a subplot about a man's missing brother, and more than a few characters running across busy streets. Best of all, it features that climactic moment when all the major viewpoints converge into a single narrative. I can't say that the story is unpredictable--that would depend on your ability to detect elaborate plot twists. What I can say is that, even if you do figure everything out too soon, you'll probably still have fun watching it.",1203638400,3,5333,4.875413450937155
3093931,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point was the film I chose to see this weekend at my local theater and I went in with high hopes. The storyline, which is a part-interlocking , part-flashback film (which, for the record, are my two favourite film elements combined into one!) is simple, yet complex to uncover. The film opens at a UN gathering of world leaders in Spain, with a big crowd, in an even bigger square. Suddenly the president of the United States is shot twice by an unseen assassin. The next thing you know, two bombs go off, one of them destroying the square.

The film is made up of that story told five times--each from a different point of view from a different person who was there. First, we've got agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who is back on assignment after taking a bullet for the president six months prior. He's paranoid, and picks up on any slight signal that could mean an assassination threat. Next, there's a shady looking cop who commits a strange act at the scene--is he corrupt? You decide. Third, we've got the American tourist (Forest Whitaker) who loves videotaping things. Fourth, we have the president himself, and fifth--we see the assassination unfold before our eyes. In addition to these four main characters, there are four others who are involved in the scenes, and combined, makes for a total of eight people searching for the truth--or who are somehow involved in it.

Each ""vantage point"" (hence the film's righteous name) offers more and more clues as to which of these people were involved in the assassination. Director Pete Travis delivers a bang-up job in making the plot line completely and utterly unpredictable. Even most people who can guess plot twists coming at any speed will be left baffled and thinking hard. My favourite aspect of the film was that it was entirely the same thing on repeat--yet different every time. There were some stupid idiots in my theater that were booing every time the scene got restarted, and that's where I think a lot of people will dislike this film, because it is undoubtedly repetitive. However, I feel the redundancy of the film adds to its original essence and its tension. The tension in the film is done very well and the first quarter of the film will have you holding on to your seat. Although there's a more than action packed climax, people who just want to see stuff blown up and people shot and car chases will be left disappointed throughout the movie. Don't worry--even throughout the redundancy there's plenty of that good stuff. My other favourite aspect of the film was its acting--Dennis Quaid was excellent and Forest Whitaker blew me away like he always does, in a role perfectly cast for him. Sigourney Weaver's brief cameos were done very well and everyone in the cast does a great job.

All that being said, Vantage Point is definitely not without its flaws. Some of the characters aren't introduced right and the execution in many scenes is done very sloppily. The climax (although ironically long) is extremely rushed and, in my opinion, was done rather poorly. Unfortunately I can't elaborate without giving away major spoilers, but it is a fun ending to watch nevertheless, and you are able to forgive the sloppy editing. The thing that made me want to cry was the horribly clichd conclusion that shouldn't have happened. In my opinion...they should've revised the screenplay. I hope there's an alternate ending on the DVD.

So, if you're looking for a decent thriller or a movie to check out, you might just want to see Vantage Point. The classic assassination thriller, a splash of originality, garnished with great acting and an unneeded sloppy ending turns out to be one bittersweet cocktail. But mostly just sweet.",1203638400,2,3715,4.809076682316119
3093932,3,B0012QCZ5O,"President Ashton (William Hurt) is scheduled to make an appearance in Spain, with a number of other world leaders, to show their support of a recent Anti-Terrorism bill they have all worked on. The Secret Service is out in force to protect POTUS (The President of the United States) from the massive crowds that have assembled. One of those agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) is back on the job after a lengthy recovery after taking a bullet for the President a year ago. As this is his first assignment back, he is, naturally, a little shell shocked. His partner, Taylor (Matthew Fox) is confident the veteran can handle the action. An American tourist, Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) stumbles upon the ceremony, and, eager to share the memories with the folks at home, videotapes everything. A Spanish Policeman, Javier (Edgar Ramirez) tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, but she is cold to him, and only wants the bag she asked him to bring. Dejected, he begins to put two and two together and rushes to the stage as... The GNN is also on hand, to cover the press conference and the harried director, Rex (Sigourney Weaver) is shocked when her cameras capture the assassination of the President. But Barnes begins to suspect there is more going on and is determined to find out the truth.

""Vantage Point"", the new film directed by Pete Travis (who comes from British Television) and written by Barry Levy, uses an interesting narrative device to frame an overworked story. But they don't seem to fully embrace the idea and the results are a mixed bag.

""Vantage"" sets up its narrative device very quickly, and efficiently, giving us a jam packed opening segment. Basically, Rex and her team are covering the President's speech. As his arrival is imminent, Rex is trying to coordinate all of the different cameras, her liberal reporter (Zoe Saldana) and the network in New York. As soon as the President arrives, Rex is confident she has worked out the kinks, but she is shocked, as is everyone else, when the President is captured on camera receiving two bullets. Shortly thereafter, Barnes bursts into her control room and wants to see video. When he scans through the video, something catches his eye. Then, the film literally rewinds, showing us a few key images, presumably clues to what is going on, and a clock shows us we have rewound the last twenty minutes to just before Noon. Now, we see the same events, but through Barnes' eyes, seeing the different things he sees, learning different information.

As the story unfolds again, we move a little further in the narrative before the film rewinds and we are back to Noon. This time, we are watching the same events unfold through President Ashton's eyes. Then, we rewind again and watch the events through Javier's eyes. This happens a number of times, each story showing us slightly different information, ending slightly later, giving us a larger view of the same picture. As we watch the events unfold again and again, we learn more and more and realize maybe Barnes is right.

The audience at the screening I attended seemed to get a little annoyed by the rewinding narrative. Ever heard of Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" folks? ""Vantage Point"" isn't as good as Kurosawa's masterpiece, but it is an interesting technique to use in this day and age. It also keeps the film moving at a fast clip. As each of these segments runs about fifteen minutes, all of the various story elements within are presented at hyper speed, to make sure we always arrive at the same point. This isn't to say they feel forced, they just move, and this makes the film seem fast paced. So, for these reasons, I appreciated the narrative device.

But towards the end of the film, when Barnes is chasing the bad people through the streets of Salamanca, it occurred to me that we missed a couple of vantage points. These segments allow each of the characters to become established in our eyes, as the segments present their point of view of the proceedings. The characters who are given full segments are more interesting and viable, even if they are a bit formulaic. One segment is devoted to three or four people, all of whom are behind the plot, only showing us their actions in the plot. This is problematic because we never learn, beyond some overused jingoistic slogans, why these people are interested in assassinating our President.

 There is a `big surprise' towards the end of the film which is more or less telegraphed very early on. Anyone who has seen more than a few thrillers or similar suspense films will likely be able to figure this out much earlier than the filmmakers want you to. This is a bit of a let down because when they reveal this big surprise, you have already figured it out and it seems more commonplace than anything else.

Because each of the stars has basically one segment to call their own, they have to develop their character at a rapid pace. This shortened focus on their individual characters helps to make them seem more interesting than they are; many of them are little more than clichs, but since we only spend ten to fifteen minutes focusing on them, these problems aren't as apparent. Naturally, as these characters interact, they make `guest appearances' in each of the stories, and the filmmakers have smartly held back key moments, for instance, we don't see what Barnes sees in the videotape until much later in the film, of some of these characters until the attention shifts to their character or until the film is about the come to a close, building the suspense nicely.

Quaid, one of the most underrated actors working today, fares well. His back story is established during the first segment, concentrating on the GNN coverage of the event. Rex catches a glimpse of him in one of the cameras and commands one of her editors to pull up the story, rehashing Barnes previous attempts at thwarting an assassin's bullet. So, when the attention shifts to Barnes, all we need to see is his shaky hand to know he is feeling a little trepidation about his return to duty. Because he is nervous, he naturally sees assassins every where.

William Hurt also does a very good job as President Ashton. Ashton seems more self-aware, more conscious of his image and his actions on the rest of the world than we are perhaps used to. This is why he is so determined to see this agreement he has forged, an agreement to fight terrorism, become a reality. When he is presented with a plan to retaliate against the people suspected of the attack, he downplays the need to act immediately, aware that this is what they want and also aware of the consequences of attacking a friendly country. As he enters the ceremony, among signs labeling him a murderer and a terrorist, he also seems to disregard these as the necessary evils of his job.

Sigourney Weaver's role as Rex, the director of the news network feed, is a bit short, and reactionary. She has a brief fight with her reporter (Saldana) and then simply reacts to the rest of the events. The person I saw this film with wondered if part of her role had been edited, left on the cutting room floor, because it seems unnaturally abrupt.

Forest Whitaker plays the American tourist, Howard Lewis, traveling through Europe for the first time. We learn he and his wife are taking a break, to clear their heads, so Howard decides to travel and assiduously videotape everything he sees. Howard isn't a bad character, he is interesting, but his purpose is just too treacly to do the film any good. A Spanish girl, walking with her mom, accidently bumps into Howard, dropping her ice cream. Howard is apologetic, he has kids of his own, kids he misses dearly, and offers to buy her a replacement cone. Her mother declines. No, I'm not kidding, this is actually what happens to his character. Later, they are brought together in a moment that is just too farfetched to believe.

Matthew Fox is good, but he seems designed to give Barnes the requisite encouragement he needs to get past his demons. As such, his character isn't exactly well-formed.

""Vantage Point"" has problems, but it also has some benefits. It benefits from a fast-pace, interesting narrative device and some good work by well-respected character actors. These benefits almost outweigh the problems in the film. Almost.",1203552000,3,8301,4.751561415683553

3093948,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point is one of these all-action thrillers which, when well executed, will keep you on your tip toes, enthralled until the very last minute, and unaware of a number of plot weaknesses.

The trick used to achieve this is to have the same story  a terrorist attack and assassination attempt against the President of the United States during his speech in Salamanca (Spain)  seen through the eyes of eight different witnesses and participants of the events including the President himself, with each of them adding something different to the story, something that others were not part of, did not see or did not realise the significance of what they were seeing.

The device is a particularly powerful one that does a lot to keep up the suspense and also makes you miss imperfections, weaknesses or implausible elements of the scenario. For instance, you are never quite told about whom the attackers really are and why they are carrying out such an attack. More importantly, this feature and the storys fast pace simply does not leave you enough time to realise just how implausible some of the scenes happen to be.

Perhaps the most extreme example of implausibility is that of a rogue member of the Spanish Special Forces who, single handed, overpowers and shoots to pieces the whole of the US Presidents highly trained and professional security detail from the Secret Service. He gets away with it with barely a scratch - I am slightly exaggerating here because he does end up wounded, but not critically - despite the fact that his multiple opponents are just as well trained as he happens to be.

Then there are the actors performances. Some of them are quite remarkable; such as Sigourney Weaver as the TV senior journalist of some CNN-equivalent Team sent out to cover the event and which is on the scene when the President gets shoot at and everyone blows up, both figuratively and literally. Forest Whitaker is also excellent, and perhaps the best performer of all when playing the role of a totally innocent US tourist who happened to be in town, came to see and hear his Presidents speech. He gets caught up in the events but completely misses  as the vast majority of the participants - a large part of what is really going on. The characters played by Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are perhaps more conventional and you might in fact be tempted to make some comparisons with two somewhat similar characters (Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland) playing in the Sentinel while Said Taghmaoui makes up a suitable  although not very original or subtle nasty.

3094102,1,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point, 2008 film

The US President is addressing an audience at a plaza in Spain. There are shots, the President is hit! There is confusion among the crowd. Then a bomb explodes! The Chief Secret Service agent say a flash from a window as it happened. A Spanish bodyguard is arrested; what does he know? There is a chase through crowded streets, the man gets away. [Scenes are repeated to pad out the story. What did you see?] Was this recorded on a video phone? The photographer joins the chase after that bodyguard. That young girl is rescued. [This adds drama to the story.]

We learn about the use of a double. There is a rogue agent involved! Terrorists are seeking revenge for an earlier attack. The President is tired of hiding. There is a car chase on the streets and sidewalks of this city. Then a crash! Wheres my brother? Where is POTUS? That ambulance has an accident and overturns. Ive got you. Thomas Barnes calls for help. The police arrive to secure the scene. President Ashton has survived! The assassins were eliminated. You wonder who was behind this.

This could have been a better movie with a better script. Those numerous repetitive scenes only pad out the story. Watch The Parallax View for the best example of a story about intrigue and suspense based on historical events. The US Secret Service began Presidential Protection after McKinley was shot, since then no President was ever lost to an assassins pistol.",1430956800,,1445,4.726190476190476

3094131,4,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT

 Whee!  Vantage Point is an A ticket thrill ride.  Secret Service hero agent Dennis Quad gets in the middle of an attempt on the life of the President of the USA at a summit on terrorism in Spain.  There is a car chase in this one that sets new levels of mayhem, Steve McQueen eat your heart out.  There is quick cut film editing for the chase that gives it a larger than life immediacy and a high level of anxiety.  It is a real knuckle biter.
 The ad copy for the movie compares itself to the classic Japanese flick, Rashomon.  The comparison is not, unfortunately, because both movies were or will be Oscar winners.  The comparison is because the film covers the assassination attempt from several points of view, hence the title.  This is an interesting and effective technique that is taken about one view point too long.  While it lasts, the multiple view points keep us guessing as to just what is going on, beyond the obvious crime.
 Forest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver have supporting roles, and the estimable William Hurt is the president, but frankly the acting is almost a side issue.  Granted, it is fun to see experts working, but the real pleasure here is to try to keep up with the fast moving action as best we can.
 The movie has made back its backers money in only ten days.  They will be as happy as the viewers are that they put this one on film.  It runs a fast and furious one and a half hours.  The movie is rated as PG13 for the general murder and terrorism.  No nakey people.  BTW this is the first major film lately that has Islamic terrorists rather than Russians or Nazis or even the American government.  Three fun filled saw blades for Vantage Point.",1425772800,,1697,4.427184466019417

However, whoever the idiot was who designed the presentation (as versus, a very good plot) should be forever banned from any association with the entertainment industry  other than, perhaps, running a concession stand.

What tries the patience an eventually ruins the flick, is the interminable and pointless flashbacks, needlessly and repeatedly covering the opening sequences  I eventually started counting how many times theyd go over the same scenes from varying points of view, but finally they tried my patience once too many and I just yelled at the player, I get it and switched it off.

First of all it has an excellent ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Forrest Whittaker, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana in a supporting role. This movie is action packed, fast paced and somewhat of a thriller.

Forrest Whitaker""s character is an American tourist in Europe. While he's in Europe he attends and videotapes a speech that the President of the United States has in Europe. During the President's speech a bombing occurs and an assassination attempt on the President. Dennis Quaid's character is a member of the secret service. Dennis Quaid's character becomes involved the investigation of the assassination plot and attempts to save the president. Forest Whitaker's character becomes involved when his videotape is needed for the investigation.

Vantage Point has an interesting way of introducing different sequences of events necessary to understand and follow the plot of the film. As a rule I don't usually like it when segments of a film are shown with different timelines involved. Vantage Point however manages to do this with out making the film seem choppy or annoying.

3094197,4,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" is great! This is how the story goes: Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor are two Secret Service agents assigned to protect President Ashton at a landmark summit on the global war on terror. When President Ashton is shot moments after his arrival in Spain, chaos ensues and disparate lives collide in the hunt for the assassin. In the crowd is Howard Lewis, an American tourist who thinks he's captured the shooter on his camcorder while videotaping the event for his kids back home. Also there is American TV news producer Rex Brooks, relaying the historic event to millions of TV viewers across the globe. As they and others reveal their stories, the pieces of the puzzle will fall into place - and it will become apparent that shocking motivations lurk just beneath the surface. The cast led by Dennis Quaid (as Thomas Barnes), Matthew Fox (as Kent Taylor), Forest Whitaker (as Howard Lewis), Sigourney Weaver (as Rex Brooks), and William Hurt (as President Ashton) is excellent. The directing by Pete Travis is great. The story and screenplay by Barry L. Levy is great. The music by Atli rvarsson (who also did the music to the upcoming ""Babylon A.D."" (2008) is excellent.

By the film's end I was waiting for our shaky-handed, Secret Service hero to rip-off his shirt to expose a big Superman letter ""S"" on his chest! Terrorists who blithely slaughter innocent people left and right will throw everything out the window over a single child! You know a bomb has just been planted but you keep standing around talking. A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last. Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and clonks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly! But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!

I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling. Too bad it was wasted on such a unbelievably ridiculous story! It's as if Hollywood's main concern is satisfying it's teenage market segment over all others. I'm not a teenager and I go to the movies virtually every week! What about the adult segment of your market? Don't we count for anything?

This film is trying terribly hard to be a frantic 'French Connection' type movie without worrying much about the story. If all you want is dumbed-down, murder and mayhem, a sort of terrorist war-porn flick, then Vantage Point is for you!

3094243,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I considered titling the review ""Rashamush,"" since so many are eager to compare ""Vantage Point"" to that classic. But it's not even close. For starters, the characters may as well be made of cardboard. if you haven't figured out the bulk of ""Vantage Point"" within the first 30 minutes or better, you haven't watched enough political thrillers lately. Even with the predictability aside, there are bits here that are all but unfathomable.

For instance, the American Tourist, as played by Forrest Whittaker. His camocrder captures the assassination/terrorist attack, but he's a bit of a - to be kind - portly guy. Before you know it, he's racing down the street, videoing with the product placement - sorry, the Sony - minicam while keeping up with two secret service agents who are chasing a very in-shape potential suspect. The man he's supposed to be would have been out of breath after a couple blocks, but not this guy. He's the energizer bunny with a videotape.

The terrorists are willing to blast away any 'loose ends,' suicide bomb a hotel, blow up an entire crowd, but suddenly get concerned over a little girl? Huh? Oh yes, and these bloodthirsty, multicultural warriors (after all, the terrorists can't possibly be racially profiled) who kidnap a high ranking government official do so and race off WITHOUT RESTRAINING THE HOSTAGE. So guess what said captive manages to do soon after? And no, the answer isn't negotiate a peaceable settlement.

Then there's the car chase. It's so impossibly choreographed as to be laughable. Yet Secret Service Agents Matthew Fox and Dennis Quiad manage to duck and weave their way through itty bitty streets and one-ways in reverse that you start wondering if Fox was trying to outmaneuver the rapid decline of his acting career. Add one ""America isn't like THAT"" Presidential sermon, a sappy resolution for Forrest, and the fact that the terrorists seem to have no agenda (how PC is that?), ""Vantage Point"" becomes a movie that wastes its talent (poor Sigourney Weaver as a b---chy producer in particular) that whatever POV it thought it had becomes more of a vanishing point.",1334707200,2,2122,4.955056179775281

The movie had to do with the President of the US speaking at a conference in Spain and an attempt to end his life. Well, the conspirators succeeded in killing a stand-in double. In any case, this murder was viewed from eight ""Vantage Points"" so you ended up seeing the same thing over and over but from different perspectives. It was an interesting idea but became tedious and failed as a movie.

Watching the same thing over and over eight times was deadening, even if it was from eight different perspectives. The idea might have worked on a smaller scale, but the cast of the movie numbered in the multi-thousands and it just resembled total chaos, as it would in real life. A major task was just  remembering who the major characters were and what they had to do with the main plot. The acting was marginal. Then it got down to a long and meaningless auto chase scene (well done, I might add) and the whole thing became largely incomprehensible, at least for me. The director and his crew probably understood it perfectly, but the movie isn't made for the director. In any case, the movie represents an interesting innovation, but it failed as a movie.

3094249,2,B0012QCZ5O,"While the overall premise of the film is interesting, this movie was not executed in an interesting way.
Vantage Point shows us a terrorist attack on the President of the United States from several different characters' point of view.
The idea of this movie was to take a scene and show it from several different perspectives that would slowly reveal to us who was behind the attack. That would be interesting, except for the fact that there were too many different points of view, and not enough interesting moments happening between them. Each viewpoint is started with a few-second countdown to 12:00 P.M.. After three times, I groaned when this scene would pop up again. After three viewpoints, you just want to know who did it and you really, really don't want to see the attack again. Of all the characters in the film, only four of them are interesting enough to follow. The others just add monotony to the film. Cut their scenes out and it would have been a much smoother and exciting ride. No offense to anyone, but I would definitely cut out the little Hispanic girl from the film. She was so annoying! And when she ran out into traffic and just screamed for five minutes while the ambulance slowly came at her... just ticked me off.

**Spoiler Alert**
Yes, I know that without her jetting out in front of the ambulance the bad guys would have likely escaped, but it was still annoying to have to watch.
**End Spoiler Alert**

Another disappointment of the film for me was the Control Room scene with Sigourney Weaver. If you are the director of a live broadcast involving several world leaders, you would not be as relaxed and motionless as the people in that Control Room were in that scene. Weaver would be constantly talking to cameramen, yelling orders to crew members, watching each TV screen for better camera angles, and she would certainly NOT have time to take a phone call during the show! Someone did not do their research.
Sorry, I'll step down from my soap box. Overall, the film had some interesting plot twists and exciting moments, but it was too redundant to be an enjoyable watch.

As far as questionable content:
Since the film deals with terrorists, there are some disturbing images, violence and profanity throughout.

3094250,5,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie is unpredictable. I could not guess what was coming until the end.

It has a unique way of telling a story. The plot is unfolded in 4 or 5 different people's points of views. First, you'll see the motorcade of the president of the United States arrived at the scene. At about noon, he was shot. Then, a huge explosion occurred at the scene that killed a lot of people. Next, the film was rewinded to 23 minutes earlier. Then it was told in the eyes of a secret service agent, Dennis Quaid. This time the narration stopped about 15 minutes after the president was shot. It showed us what was happening after the explosion. Then the movie was turned back 23 minutes again. This time, it was told in another person point of view. Each time, it revealed a little more about the plot and action. To me, the filming and the technique are very effective. It's very suspenseful. It keeps my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.

A few critics said the movie lost its momentum because when the climax was about to be reached, the movie was rewinded. Yes, the first time it was done, it irritated me a little but five minutes later I was completely satisfied. It was because more details of the plot were revealed in another person's point of view! Further, the picture moved at fast pace so the rewinding did not cause any boredom.

The special effects are impressive. Especially, the explosion at the Plaza looks very real. It has some twists too.

Somebody said the ending was far fetched. Yes, so are the endings of many other movies. That does not reduce their entertaining values because they are not documentaries.

Unfortunately, the movie ends up a jumbled, incohesive mess.  There are so many stories and characters that alot of major questions never get answered.  He would have been much better off eliminating the pointless character of the voyeur, played by Forrest Whitaker.  He plays a very creepy guy (like raincoat flasher creepy).  The movie would have been much better and less confusing if they had edited out his character and the entire story line, and instead focused upon the conspiracy itself and the perpetrators.

I couldn't quite figure out what was going on in the beginning, it was fairly vague...something to do with the president, a Spanish leader, and maybe the Pope? I didn't know for sure. This was actually okay, because I got to see it over again in a few minutes from another perspective. And another. And another. And another. You basically see the first ten minutes of the movie about four or five times over, like a crash course in redundancy.

Thankfully, the movie stops chasing its own tail and progresses forward to show us who the nameless faceless characters are, and who is really in on the 'deal'.

Except, nobody really tells you what the 'deal' is. By the end of the movie you are left scratching your head to what this whole movie was actually about. It's a false execution, a snatching of the president, some dumbfounded SS agents, and a bunch of Spanish activists that are on some violent mission of some sort to prove something. And while all of this is happening, I'm expecting some grand unveiling of what it's all about - and it never happens. Just a mess of confusion and people shooting at each other. The movie falsely climaxes at the end with a few dead people, no real resolution, and little explanation of anything. Characters are mentioned but never shown or talked about (such as the 'brother' that dolt is shouting about towards the end), and this 'Mayor' that apparently is so important to the guy who is running from SS for half of the movie (I couldn't tell if he was actually a good guy or a bad guy). And nevermind the camcorder footage - it really doesn't mean anything at all, as it turns out.

Now, about the acting...

Dennis Quaid over-acts as usual, trying to strike fear with his dramatic tone of voice and inability to handle stressful situations. (he's one of the most agitating actors to me, but that's another story)

Forest Whittaker must have had the easiest job in the world for this film - a philanthropic soul with a video camera on vacation in Spain, taking in the sights and sounds...meeting a little girl and spilling her ice cream, then miraculously saving her life after all of the bad stuff goes down... honestly they could have used anyone that's starred in a B-movie for this role.

Sigourney Weaver is almost absent, her largest role being the first ten minutes directing TV anchors to get the best shot. Really, someone send an alien down to make this movie more interesting. The other people I don't even remember, that's how memorable they were.

Ultimately, ""Vantage Point"" is a fail. A vague plot line, no real direction, and a repetitive, yawn-inducing first half of the movie.

3094266,4,B0012QCZ5O,"During a rainy July fourth, I watched Vantage Point. Starring Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox as Secret Service agents, Sigourney Weaver as a cable news director, and Forrest Witaker as a tourist with a video camera, Vantage Point gives you a look at the same fifteen minutes of an event from multiple, you guessed it, vantage points.

The President of the United States has gathered with many of the world's leaders in Spain to initiate a new task force to battle terrorism. As he steps up to the podium, with arms outstretched, a sniper shoots him. The place goes into chaos with people running around, screaming; and then the bomb goes off.

Dennis Quaid is the seasoned agent who had taken a bullet for the President earlier in his term and is just now returning to active duty because his partner (Fox) believes in him. He does a great job with that sour face of his. I think in almost every movie he's in, he wears that scowl. That could be because his smile is very goofy.

Matthew Fox comes across as your typical American hero. I haven't seen Speed Racer or We Are Marshall, but this man will have a future in films.

Sigourney Weaver starts the movie off, but you really don't see much of her. I guess that's alright. We see her point of view first and then that's it.

There are twists as you would expect in this film. It is a good action-thriller. The run time is only one hour and thirty minutes so it's a very quick movie.

3094267,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I recently, finally got to see this movie and really liked it.
Lets get the small issues that others have mentioned out of the way.
Yes, the car chase was a bit over-the-top and ""Hollywood"" but if you paid attention to the character that was driving (Quaid), this is the guy that is supposed to be one of the best at what he does.
Zoe Saldana's character (Reporter) that makes crass comments about her own country in her report may have made people say, ""She can't do that!"" but that is exactly what that character was doing. She made you NOT like her. So, lets give credit to the acting here and not the fact that it was a character we all wanted to punch in the face.
The multiple cuts from one person's short story or ""vantage point"" was a nice way to tell this story. There is a LOT of foreshadowing in this movie. That's how they told the story. Showing you a little here and little there and you have to piece it together yourself.
Example: Forest Whittaker is a tourist filming the event and is politely speaking and greeting the people on balconies. He notices right before the terrorist event that all the people on the balconies have gone inside and closed the windows. You can see in his face that he knew, something was about to happen.
Sigourney Weaver's character being a strong woman, in charge of the television action as the event happens may not have been a big acting stretch for her, cuz we've seen her do this before but as her coworkers plead, ""cut the feed"" you can see in her face, she wants to keep it going but does the right thing. She cuts the feed but still records which helps Quaid later in the movie.
Well made, well written and although a little over-the-top, was worth 4 stars.
You don't have to watch this more than once but it is worth watching more than once to pick up on more foreshadowing and it sort of makes a game out of watching it.",1294012800,,1876,4.332386363636363

The concept of the movie was interesting, I'll give it that much.  Terrorists (or possibly security forces, or maybe Spanish police...I never did figure that part out) try to kill the President.  (Or maybe not. That part wasn't clear either.) There is a news crew that records the event, a clueless tourist with a camera, a secret service guy with personal problems, and loads of indistinguishable bad guys.  The story, such as it was, is told and retold, going back over the same 25 minutes, from all those different points of view. (Except for the news crew, which somehow gets left out of the plot.) As a story-telling device this could have been quite effective, except you actually need a story to pull it off.

There wasn't one. Nobody EVER explains who the guys were who were trying to kill and/or kidnap the President. (Why kidnap the President anyhow? Can you hold the President for ransom?) And there was so much shooting and maiming and killing that there wasn't anybody left at the end who even knew what was going on.  I certainly didn't, and I'm pretty sure the writer didn't either.

I thought the constant rewinding--and replaying--of the same hectic scene (an assassination attempt on the President who is abroad in Espanol) was terrifically invigorating; different perspectives make for different realities (what appears as major to one character turns out to be inconsequential to another).

The action is tight, the pacing adrenaline-fast, and the suspense and intrigue aromatically heady, as a group of terrorists perp a complicated plot involving murder and mayhem (for reasons known only to themselves, certainly not to the viewer).  It's as over the top as elephants flying to the moon on gossamer wings (for instance, access to the Prez is a snap), yet the titanic suspension of disbelief is half the fun.  While others have lamented that VANTAGE POINT is nothing more than a copycat of 'been there, done that,' to me, having never seen an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B000NDEXK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>, this flick delivers original excitement and suspense by the boatload.

The gimmick is we see the same 15 minute sequence about 7-8 times, each time through the eyes of a different character in a Spanish city where the US president comes under a terrorist attack. The terror plot is all too plausible. Let's hope no one gets any ideas from this. Most of the actors are fine and the dialogue is ok. Only Forest Whitaker is a bit too hapless as the American tourist who accidentally films everything on his video cam. A normal person would be cowering under a bush after shots were fired and a huge bomb goes off. But hey, it's Hollywood..",1273017600,,608,4.4375
3094295,3,B0012QCZ5O,"This is perhaps the most contrived film in history. It's a thriller along the lines of Crash, but more disjointed, and not nearly as satisfying. Dennis Quaid plays a Secret Service agent responsible for helping to protect the President during a War on Terror summit in Salamanca, Spain. But things go wrong: the President is shot, a nearby hotel is bombed, and finally the podium area of the summit is bombed. By replaying the final 25 minutes leading up to these events, numerous times, the filmmakers piece together the various people involved from different vantage points. It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes. Only Forest Whitaker's performance raises this film above the average - that and a very good chase scene with Quaid. Waitsel Smith",1271808000,,883,4.972972972972973
3094296,3,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" was directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The attempted assassination of the President of the United States is told from several different points of view until all the pieces come together. Members of the cast include Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.

In this ensemble piece, the editing and pacing of the movie was very strong. The car chase scene was one of the better ones I've seen, it was very exciting and engaging. Some of the twists and turns in the plot were very predictable but others were pretty enjoyable. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to solve it before they come out and tell you what happened. It almost reminded me of the first few episodes of ""Lost"" where each character's perspective of where they were and what they were doing when the plane crashed ending with something suspenseful. Eventually it all converges on the same city block.

On the flip side of that, I think too many perspectives were used. Usually about three is a good number to go with in telling different versions of a story, beyond that it gets a little cluttered and unorganized. At the fourth time, I was like, ""Really? We're going back to 11:59am AGAIN?"" Despite all that, it only has a 90 minute running time because the back story on characters is very brief and given through conversations so it all mostly converges on the assassination attempt and aftermath.

Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana are very underutilized in this film. They show up in the beginning to show the newscasters' perspective of the events with Saldana as a reporter trying to throw her own commentary on the event along with the news and Weaver shutting her down as the editor. This leads into Quaid's back story of his Secret Service Agent career with Matthew Fox.

Forest Whitaker plays a tourist watching the whole slew of events through his camcorder and he veers between awestruck delight at his surroundings to distressed terror and determination for some reason to run down the bad guys and try to capture all the evidence he can with his camera. Granted, he does capture many relevant moments in footage, but the average tourist of his size risking his life is pretty surprising since he isn't an off-duty Jack Bauer or anything. William Hurt's performance as the President is very brief (like many performances in the film) and he mostly fiddles with paperwork and rides in cars.

Matthew Fox's performance was the most predictable with no surprises whatsoever. He plays the same stubborn guy he plays in ""Lost"" but as a Secret Service Agent instead of a surgeon. I would be so relieved if Jack on ""Lost"" somehow got offed in this last season. I could care less who Kate chooses, I think the biggest surprise would be if she chose Claire instead of Jack or Sawyer.

All in all, this is an exciting thriller with very short performances and maybe a few too many versions to the story, but edited together very well.",1270944000,,3016,4.7461832061068705
3094297,3,B0012QCZ5O,"When I heard about the premise of this film, I thought it sounded interesting and ambitious: the same exciting moment in time as seen from several different points of view.  The American president gets assasinated while preparing to give a speech in a public square in Spain.  The same half hour or so is seen through the eyes of a news producer (Sigourney Weaver) and her reporter, a Secret Service Agent (Dennis Quaid), an onlooker (Forrest Whitaker) in the crowd assembled to watch the speech, and several of the people involved in plotting to kill the president. Because of all the intense action and different points of view, we rarely see exactly the same thing, so the film isn't boring at all.  But there are several aspects of the movie that are very far-fetched.  (I can't say what without putting spoilers into the review, so please take my word on this)!  However the thing that really bothered me about this is that we spend half the movie watching the bad guys, and we never really understand any of their motivation for their actions.  For instance, after shooting the president, there are two explosions near his podium that really only harm the onlookers.  Even at the end of the movie, there's only one line that even attempts to explain the wherefores of all that we've just watched, so for me the film is really unsatisfying.  Its saving graces are the well done action sequences and the performances of Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whitaker, as well as one of the good guys who's been roped into being one of the assassins by the kidnapping of a family member - again, far fetched.

If you like action movies with very little heart, or you're a big fan of Dennis Quaid or Forrest Whitaker, buy the movie.  Otherwise, I can't really recommend it.

Also there is American TV news producer Rex Brooks, relaying the historic event to millions of TV viewers across the globe. As they and others reveal their stories, the pieces of the puzzle will fall into place - and it will become apparent that shocking motivations lurk just beneath the surface.

1.  The movie portrays the Secret Service as a bunch of poorly trained buffoons.  I know for a fact that this is nonsense.  These guys are highly trained specialists.  A lot of them are ex-military.  There is no way that one guy could take out over a dozen of them like portrayed in the film.  No way.
2.  The worlds dumbest kid stops dead in front of a speeding ambulance and the terrorist driver swerves out of the way to avoid killing her.  Since when do terrorists worry about killing kids?
3.  One of the terrorists has a cell phone with technology from the 31st century.  He can detonate bombs, activate machine guns, and shave in the morning with this thing.  The only thing missing from it was a transporter from Star Trek.
4.  If kidnapping the President of the United States was that easy, G.W. Bush would have been taken out 6 years ago.  Utter nonsense.
5.  The longest car chase since Gone in 60 Seconds, was just a boring waste of time.

I just could not get past these plot failures enough to enjoy the movie.  To me, it was about as realistic as Pirates of the Carribean.",1256256000,,1325,4.378600823045267

In this we have Dennis Quaid as a Secret Service agent who witnesses the shooting & tries to piece together everything that has happened, much like Cage's cop does in ""Snake Eyes"" after a Senator is shot at a boxing match

We have a rogue Secret Service agent(Matthew Fox), just as Gary Sinise was a rogue cop in ""Snake Eyes"" that may or may not be involved

We have an unwilling, but determined witness(Forest Whittaker) who himself tries to put the pieces together, just Carla Gugino's character does in Cage's film

We have members of the President's staff with their own agendas as did the boxing promoters did in Cage's film

& like in Cage's film we have a mysterious man & woman who are involved but yet it never really becomes clear as to why they are involved or who they really work for

All in all this one is good even though it does mirror Cage's ""Snake Eyes"", it has one cool chase scene in it that is intense, I like both films, I always like a film that will show different events going on at the same time, where you see characters doing things that will eventually bring things together, ""Star Trek"" did this quite well in many of their episodes, as did ""Back To The Future II"", & especially the hit show ""Lost"" which really shows different events going on at the same time as events you have already seen, so if you like different perspectives, all the ones  mentioned here are fun to watch.",1254182400,,2004,4.414634146341464

U.S. president Ashton (William Hurt) is in Salamanca, Spain to announce plans for a major global summit on terrorism. The U.S. President stands behind the podium in front of a shouting crowd in a large plaza.  Protesters are roped off on a side area.

The first scene of the assassination is the news center with television news Producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  We watch as she is surprised to see Secret Service Agent Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who recently took a bullet for the President - back on duty with darting eyes focusing on a second story window where a curtain moves.  The President is shot twice -  then we hear a small explosion and then a massive blast.  Rex's news anchor dies before her and the TV audience.  Somehow Agent Barnes gets to the news center and rewinds the film and sees a clue.  Then he runs off again.

Then the film rewinds over and over to just before noon on that fateful day.  It becomes tedious but you get a new clue with each rewind.  This gimmick did not help the movie (the movie could have covered the plot in 30 minutes).  You had to relive the blast and gunshots way too many times.  The plot was too convoluted.

It is my hope that my review will be objective enough to help you make a valid determination before you expend time and money on it.

The plot summary on the DVD case reads: ""During a historic counter-terrorism summit in Spain, the President of the United States is struck down by an assassin's bullet.  Eight strangers have a perfect view of the kill, but what did they really see?  As the minutes leading up to the fatal shot are replayed through the eyes of each witness, the reality of the assassination takes shape.  But just when you think you know the answer, the shattering truth is finally revealed.  VANTAGE POINT is a mindbending political action-thriller starring Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox...Forest Whitaker...with Sigourney Weaver and...William Hurt..."" [ellipses mine]

Special features on the one-disc version include: ""Surveillance Tapes: Outtake""; ""An Inside Perspective: Interviews with the Cast & Crew""; ""Plotting an Assassination""; ""Coordinating Chaos: Stunt Featurette""; and ""Commentary with Director Pete Travis.""  I happened to watch three of the five, and I found them to be entertaining and worth seeing.  None that I watched were more than about 10 minutes long.

Having looked over some of the reviews for this movie (after I saw it), it seems that the two main aspects of the film that will likely make or break it for viewer are:  the ""rewinding"" of the movie 6 or 7 times (I didn't actually count) to show the same block of time and series of events from different points of view; and the extreme improbability of certain technical and action aspects of the movie.

I think your enjoyment level for this movie, then, will depend largely on what your expectations are.  If you want action, suspense, and intrigue, you certainly will not be disappointed.  I was looking for entertainment, and I found it in a big way in this movie.  If, however, you want the kind of movie where all technical elements and action sequences have to be reasonable, plausible, and precise, then you will certainly find aspects of the movie to be a disappointment or distraction and maybe even detract from the overall enjoyment.  A few examples to illustrate:  (1) The Secret Service agents who guard the President are just too easily eliminated by the bad guys.  (2) There is a pivotal moment in the movie (no spoilers here) when some chief bad guys have a pang of conscience that affects the plot's outcome in a major way.  (3) One of the terrorists has a cell phone that can do things no cell phone actually can.  (4) Dennis Quaid's character drives his car in an incredible chase scene that simply could never happen in real life without catastrophic damage to property and life.  The movie also does not seek to accomplish complex character development, but I do think the viewer will find enough of an emotional connection to the characters played by Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker in particular.

I personally found the movie to be a non-stop thrill, and it was one of the best action films I have seen in quite awhile.  Several well-known actors in the cast helped!  I also liked the ""rewinding"" of the movie so the events could be told from another perspective. I completely agree with the plot summary on the DVD case in that just when I thought I had figured out what was really going on, a different point of view was introduced that put a whole new twist on things.  I do agree with a few of the observations pointed out by the one-star reviewers who draw attention to the technical flaws and implausible elements.  For me, though, they were in no way fatal to the movie, and I was willing and able to look beyond them.

Unless you tend to be rather demanding of movies in terms of expecting technical flawlessness, I would find it hard to imagine that you could watch this movie and genuinely be disappointed.  Just for another perspective, I watched it with my two boys, ages 11 and 13, and they both were utterly impressed with it.

I give this movie five stars only because I can't give four-and-a-half.  Why not a solid five?  Simply to acknowledge that the technical flaws and implausible elements are there.  Had the writer and director been a little more creative in making these aspects more believable, I would not hesitate to rate this movie a solid five stars.",1249171200,2,4467,4.7685305591677505

Crashes. Plenty of weapons discharged. Explosions. Blood and gore. Brutal betrayal.  But very little artistry.

There is something fascinating about how different people see the same event from different perspectives. But this film grinds that concept into the ground.

I was most excited when the film ended, just because it was over. I was almost as excited as the character portrayed by Forest Whitaker was at the end of this hectic nonsense, although for a very different reason.",1247875200,2,654,5.027777777777778

Billed as a political thriller it is really primarily a chase film but that does not stop the audience from going on an enjoyable ride even if the facts of plot don't stand up on a close review.

Essentially what we have is a sort of political Groundhog Day with the movies first 20 minutes or so being replayed over and over from the point of view of characters who witnessed or were involved in the assassination of the President of the United States at the start of an anti-terrorism summit in Spain.

While the story is interesting the first few times we see it, it soon degenerates into a long car chase that while  propelling the film to its conclusion feels sort of flat. One positive here is that Travis has assembled a great cast much of which is unfortunately underused. While not a bad effort this one could have been much better.

The Blu-Ray disc offers excellent picture and sound quality as it should on such a recent release. The extras include a commentary by Travis, three making of featurettes and a preview gallery. The BluRay exclusive GPS Tracker was nowhere to be found on my disc.

As a Dennis Quaid film fan who enjoys his salt of the earth, unpretentious ease and charm, I was a bit disappointed that his character was rather 2-dimensional and didn't develop much.  (See ""Frequency"" for a great Dennis Quaid character.)

3094334,5,B0012QCZ5O,"I had wanted to see this one since I saw a trailer in the theater, and it looked like it had a good cast with a decent stroyline.  It was pretty clear from the trailers that the President was getting shot and different people saw it in different ways.

And that is exactly what happens.  I thought it was pretty well done as each person's point of view rewinds events back to the time of the attack, and then branches off to their repsective perspectives.  And each flashback adds a little bit and piece to what happened and I found myself trying to tie each person and parts together.  Each piece added to the question of who was the good guy or gal, and who was the bad one.

It comes together towards the end with a rather traditional chase scene (which was also hinted at throughout the movie in the flashbacks.)  At the end everything gets resolved a bit neatly in terms of who gets what, and there were a couple of things that were a little annoying in that they did not make sense from what was shown of the charactors.  In other words some things bad guys would have done they did not do (do not want to play spolier though.)

But the small parts were not too objectionable in light of the fact that this is a general thriller and usually there will be one or two things that miss the mark.

There are other thrillers that are better, and some other movies portray the switching persepctive/stories better.  But if you just want to watch a general thriller that has a couple of warts, this one is good.

3094335,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Perhaps unintentionally, the makers of this flick have made it coincide with some real events. The scene of the assassination of the stand-in US President is reminiscent of St. Peter's Square, where Pope John Paul II was shot in 1981. The different viewpoints of what took place are reminiscent of the conflicting accounts of the assassination of JFK in 1963, which, of course, has encouraged conspiracy theories.

Is this flick designed to encourage Islamophobia? I think not. The real US President makes a statement in which he makes it clear that the 5 terrorists from Morocco should not be conflated with the 6 million peaceful citizens of that nation. He also realizes that the terrorists hope to provoke a US retaliation that would only antagonize peaceful Arabs.

Parts of the plot are farfetched: The assassins are totally successful, never make a mistake, and never encounter a serious obstacle to their plans. The car chasers encounter crash after crash without getting killed. A terrorist spins the car he is driving out of control in order to avoid hitting a little girl on the road.

At the culmination of a historic peace summit in Salamanca, Spain, an attempt is made on the life of the President of the United States. Each one of the primary characters sees and knows something about the true culprit. Over the course of the film, the hour is rewinded and replayed through the eyes of each character until, finally, the audience has the whole story.

This was a great action thriller. I loved the style and premise of the movie, and I really loved the fact that, even though the movie was largely about action, all the performers were really strong in their roles.

The cast was great, with heavy-hitters even in small roles. Matthew Fox plays Agent Taylor, who serves on the President's Secret Service detail. Dennis Quaid plays Agent Thomas Barnes, who's recently returned to the detail after taking a bullet for the President the previous year. William Hurt plays the Prez, and Sigourney Weaver has a great (but small) part as Rex, a television journalist on-site to cover the summit. Forest Whitaker turns in a touching performance as Howard, an American with a troubled marriage in town to observe the festivities. There are also several foreign actors in the film that you may not recognize, but who deliver the goods on screen just as well as their famous co-stars - Edgar Ramirez, Ayelet Zurer, Eduardo Noriega, and Said Taghmaqui.

I won't spoil how everything shakes out, but the ending had me on the very edge of my seat. I also think the movie made some interesting larger points about global politics and terrorism without bashing us all over the head.

3094337,2,B0012QCZ5O,"The problem with VANTAGE POINT is that it doesn't take into consideration two very important things: the point of view of the watcher, and a believable storyline. Let me explain...

Seeing a situation/crime/etc. from different points of view might be interesting to some. But if you're going to do that, you need to make sure that there are engaging points that aren't repeated ad nauseam. You might think that four or five points of view would be the maximum allowable for something like this. And you'd probably be right. But how about six? Or seven? Too many? Would you believe this one has eight?! Far, far, far too many. And they all start just about the same place, which grated on the nerves after a short while.

The storyline is pretty ridiculous, too. Doppleganger Presidents. Double Secret Service agents. Terrorists who need to hire an assassin. And an ending that is pure schlock.

Not being that much of a fan of Dennis Quaid didn't help matters for me either -- the only two films with him in them that I enjoyed were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-Mine/dp/B000059HAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy Mine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Easy/dp/6305262268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Easy</a>.

I will say, however, that the action was fun to watch. And seeing William Hurt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B001GMH8SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>) get shot multiple times was pretty enjoyable, too. But that's where my enjoyment stopped. Matthew Fox (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Racer/dp/B001CD6FKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed Racer</a>) as agent Kent Taylor was completely miscast and unbelievable. But probably the most miscast of all the characters was Forest Whitaker. Having seen Whitaker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>, I know what he's capable of. Here, he seemed like an overweight but athletic American out of his league carrying a video camera through Spain because ...well ...we're not sure.

The big and final letdown was the ending of this film. If terrorists are prepared to kill, maim, and destroy innocent people in order to get to the President of the United States, would running over a girl stop them? I doubt that. Which made me nearly turn off the film. But we had to have a happy ending, sweet and sticky, with Quaid saving the day. Ugh.",1243641600,,3186,7.11734693877551

3094339,3,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" is not a boring way to spend ninety minutes.  It has an excellent cast featuring a couple of Academy Award winners, and it has special effects that harken back to the days when car chases really looked hazardous and explosions looked like they happened to buildings rather than in a computer.

That being said, all the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is as well.  It just finished raining for about 15 minutes and the puddle outside my door is deeper than this movie.

The central story surrounds an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, played by William Hurt, while he is attending an historic anti-terrorism summit in Spain.  The film's central gimmick is that the same twenty minute period is shown repeatedly from several different perspectives.  The filmmakers insult the intelligence of the audience by ""fast-rewinding"" each twenty minute segment before starting on the ""next perspective"", so you know you're going backward in time, you know...

Each segment adds new information to what came before, and each segment extends what happened before by a few moments, until finally the ""rewinding"" stops and enough viewpoints have been introduced to allow a pretty exciting car chase with secret agents chasing bad guys and an ambulance holding the President being driven by more bad guys.

The first segment stars Sigourney Weaver as a tv news director covering the summit while choreographing her cameramen and the anchor, played by Zoe Saldana, who wants to cover the anti-American protestors as much as the Presidential summit.  After the President is shot there are two more explosions, the second one laying waste to the entire plaza and apparently killing everyone except for the handful of people whose viewpoints we are following.

The second segment follows secret service men Taylor and Barnes, played by Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid. Many are surprised to see Quaid's Barnes there - a year earlier he was shot in another attempt on the President, and this is his first time back in the saddle.

Other segments follow American tourist Howard Lewis, played by Forest Whitaker, and the Spanish Mayor's bodyguard, played by Edgar Ramirez.  A final segment takes us behind the scenes with the President and his political advisors before rewinding one final time and letting the story play forward.

The terrorists behind the attack are shown to be more cunning and apparently better equipped than the forces around the President, but they are also paper-thin caricatures and other than a few throwaway lines about how long the war on terrorism has been going on, motivations are also as shallow as that puddle I mentioned earlier.",1242604800,,2693,5.093181818181818

Not a groundbreaking plot, but the way it's executed is certainly innovative,especially for the type of movie.  As alluded to by the title, the story is told several different times from several different angles - each time entirely from the perspective of a different character.  The different angles cross and intersect, same time covering the same incidents from a different viewpoint and other times uncovering new territory and events.  I've seen this kind of thing done before in Asian movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ju-On-2/dp/B000H0M4CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ju-On 2</a>&nbsp;but I'm not aware of it having been previously applied to a straight-up, gunfights-and-car-chases style action thriller.  As it turns out, the technique molds itself to this kind of material excellently, and makes what probably would have been a good movie anyway much better.  Extreme attention is paid to detail, and the seperate tellings of the same story mesh perfectly by movie's end.  We see events unfold from the eyes of the agents, the President, the terrorists, news reporters on the scene, and everyday civilians, with a talented cast filling out their roles to great effect.  At the end, not everything about motivation and the like is explained; it feels like a sequel may have been planned, but with this kind of movie you usually have to make several fortunes to get a sequel nowadays, and while Vantage Point did well at the box office and on DVD, I'm not sure it was as much as they were hoping for.  Too bad; a follow-up could have been great.  I envision a part-sequel, part-prequel told several different times from several different viewpoints, but this time spanning months or even years instead of a few hours.  Oh well, maybe we'll get a follow-up and maybe not; either way Vantage Point itself is a great action movie and a cerebral, engaging thriller.",1241481600,,2160,5.283625730994152

No. This movie shows the viewpoint of several people at an American Presidential address given in Spain. In these frightening global times, it played on my fears while entertaining me immensely. It made me think. The acting was great. It was fast-paced. You have to pay attention every moment of the movie. And it is relatively short- it got to the point quickly, in every scene.

Dennis Quaid has really grown as an actor, and it shows in this film. As he's aged, he's taken on a seriousness and an undercurrent of being in authority that I like a lot. He is still capable of displaying the vulnerability that makes him such a versatile actor, as well.

William Hurt, who plays the President, is (as usual) also excellent. He gave an understated performance that embodies the times we live in.

Forrest Whittaker provided a sweetness and innocence in his role as a bystander that was a good counter to the plot, which was so fraught with intrigue and deception.

They combine to a breath-taking climax that brings all the stories together.

Eight different perspectives superbly tied by an amazing edition process will tell us about an assassination attempt on the president of the United States, at the moment to make a public appearance in a public square.

The magnificent process of deconstruction and reconstruction of the different clues will allow us to arrange this sinister plan of conspiracy, that will even involve part of the very control system of presidential security.

The human gaze is given by an American citizen (Forest Whitaker) when unexpectedly he will record on his digital camera the different insights of this plot. Barnes (Dennis Quaid) is the main hunter who has been assigned as the master officer, William Hurt as the president is fabulous, while Sigourney Weaver plays an initial cameo as the top leader of GNN (an important news agency) and our national proud Edgar Ramirez as the blackmailed intruder who will have to make part of the nasty plan as a ruthless shooter.

It's impossible to forget two key films that truly worked out as clever inspirational  works: ""The day of the jackal"" (1973) and ""In the line of fire"" (1993).

3094360,3,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT is a dramatic action film told from multiple points of view. The movie is set in Spain and revolves around the President of the United States as he delivers an important speech during an anti-terrorism summit.  The movie follows the President of the United States (William Hurt), two Secret Service agents (Dennis Quaid & Matthew Fox) sworn to protect him, and several bystanders in the crowd (including Forest Whitaker). During the delivery of his message, an attempted assassination attempt is made which is soon followed by other attacks.  What follows is a loud and chaotic mess as agents and officials attempt to figure out what is going on.

The movie tells its story by showing a sequence of action from one character's particular point of view, then rewinding to where the story started but seen from the eyes of another character, or ""vantage point"".  Each time this happens the audience learns a new piece of information that can help in unraveling the puzzle or further confuse.  This isn't a new technique, but it is one that is rarely seen.

I enjoyed VANTAGE POINT. The acting is top-caliber and the story has just the right mix of action and suspense.  The story offers enough clues that those with Holmesian detective skills can figure out what's going on earlier in the movie, but leaving enough loose ends open to still be able to enjoy the movie.  When I first saw VANTAGE POINT in theatres, the crowd groaned after the action rewound for the third time back to the starting point.  That was a good thing because it illustrated that they were saw involved with the story that they wanted to see it continue to its conclusion.

The scenes with Forrest Whitaker running down a street at the same pace as the athletic bad guys for minutes on end shouldn't have us laughing either.

3094386,4,B0012QCZ5O,"""What is truth?"" is the eternal question. The answer in this superior thriller is that truth depends on your vantage point, your position and role in events, who you know and what you witness. Things appear very different for the President of the United States than they do even for a lead Secret Service agent, much less for an American tourist with a movie camera, or for a little girl accompanying her mother. The key story -- which occupies only fifteen minutes of time but is repeated over and over -- concerns the attempted kidnapping of the President, who is in Spain for an anti-terrorism summit. When he's introduced in the Plaza Mayor, he's nailed by a sniper. And while the crowd is screaming and running in all directions, a bomb, tossed under the speaker's stand, detonates and turns the Plaza into a war zone. William Hurt, playing both the President and his double, is, . . . well, presidential. Dennis Quaid has aged craggily and makes a quite believable member of the security detail. Eduardo Noriega, not well known in the U.S., is good as a dedicated member of the Spanish national police, and Edgar Ramirez is scary as the head of the terrorist crew. Forest Whitaker is Howard Lewis, whose camera in the crowd picks up key information, and who joins the chase for no discernible reason than that it's happening. This marvelous film is actually much more innovative in its structure than the professional reviewers have given it credit for. They keep comparing it to Rashomon, but that's not really valid. Kurosawa gave us multiple versions of the same events and asked us to choose among them. Here we start with a lot of unanswered questions and misunderstandings on the part of its multiple-viewpoint characters, but we gradually home in on the true course of the depicted events.

3094390,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point is a thrilling movie.  Although there are some points that leave you wondering and seem a little campy, the movie overall has a unique twist to it.

You are seeing from about six different vantage points or points of view what was happening in an assassination attempt on the US president in Spain.  He is there for an anti-terrorist conference with over 100 nations present both east and west.  What is interesting about this way of doing the movie is that you get a lot of information about a very short period of time from the perspective of 6 or more individuals.  The story comes out as to who is involved and how with the rewinding and viewing from the perspective of the newsroom, a couple of terrorists, a bystander, the president himself, and a member of the Secret Service.

It would be impossible and way too choppy to have had all of these scenes from all angles if the movie was layed out like a typical piece.  Here is like the peeling back of an onion, each layer is an onion but a little different.  By doing this, we get a full picture and are left with an answer to what just happened.  Which is a question that Sigorney Weaver asks before the first rewind.

There are blasts that you hear in the distance, you get the answer for that, about half way through.  The last sequence is a coallecsing of scenes when we are taken on a spectacular car chase through the streets of Salamanca.  As the story unfolds, things seem to get worse for our hero, played by Dennis Quaid.  Zoe Saldana does a believable job as a TV news reporter, Weaver as the producer.",1230076800,,1584,4.4206896551724135

The first half hour becomes attention-grabbng, but the rest of the movie just fails to impress with its plot twists and action. I already knew the plot twist before it happened (looks like I've been watching too much ""24""). The car chase is way too unrealistic, and the sappy ending ruins the movie. The actors do splendid jobs, however. Quaid, Whitaker, and Weaver have never been better.

I'd say that the characters are the true stars. The main plot and the plot twists are very weak compared to those in other (and better) thrillers.

It is a very short movie and personally I think the reason they show the movie from 5 different angles is because they did not have enough of a story line to put together a full 90 minute film.

Be ready immediately to watch the first 10 minutes of the movie 5 separate times and then on the 6th time watch it from all the angles until the finish.  Honestly none of the so called Vantage Points are that convincing or shocking.  It is fairly easy from the beginning to pick out who the terrorists are.  One thing that was extremely frustrating was that the movie made the U.S. secret service look like a bunch of incompetent idiots that had no training.

Being only 90 minutes, it's a quick hour-and-a-half. It also helps to know that you are going to get the story told from a handful of angles, so expect to see similar scenes running over and over, each with a few new wrinkles added.

Also, expect a lot of the action scenes that are both fun to view but not very credible. My favorite - spoiler alert! - of that is when ""Thomas Barne's"" (Dennis Quaid) little blue car is totally bashed in by a huge 18-wheeler. Not only that, the car is smashed up against a brick wall. It should look like a metal pancake. Seconds later, Quaid emerges from the wreck and is running down the street like a football halfback shooting his pistol!

Whatever, it's a fun ride not to be taken seriously but as a short entertainment diversion.

The car chase reminded me of the Bourne movies and was very exciting.  I do have one issue with the car chase and that is for a movie that attempts to be as realistiic as possible it is annoying to watch cars crash over and over again but still aquire no damage when seen from a distance.

3094449,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I bought Vantage Point in a '3 DVDS for 15' sale at the supermarket. Always a bad sign, especially if a film's only been out a month or so... but I'm a sucker for a bargain, and anyway, the cast looked good.

Another giveaway for a 'stinker' is the running time. This one clocks in at only 80 minutes, suggesting it has been butchered by a despairing crew in the editing suite, who realised its flimsy one-dimensional story couldn't possibly stand up for any longer than this. Or even, indeed, that it collapsed on its weedy pencil-thin legs within 10 minutes and lay there floundering on its back like an irritating cockroach just waiting to be squished.

So.. just 80 minutes long. It gets a bonus star for not wasting too much of my life.

But then it loses three when you discover that the first 50 minutes of it is seeing the same sequence over and over again, from the viewpoints of different characters.

Quite why this was done, or what it added to the plot, is beyond me.
I thought there'd be some breathtaking double whammy at the end where, for example, they were all in it together, or that we had to piece together cleverly written clues in each segment to reveal the true shock-horror conspiracy behind the sequence of events, or something.

But no. That was way beyond the hyper young fools behind this project. What you see is a flat one-dimensional storyline, with a dull seen-it-all-before car chase tagged on it at the end. And, er, that's it.

None of the characters have any depth. They all do ludicrous out-of-character things at critical moments. The good guy who's really a bad guy is obvious from the moment you see him. And the plot is riddled with more holes than a bullet-riddled sieve.

But just why is it so bad? Have we any more clues on this DVD?

If you can bear it, I suggest you just watch a bit of the 'making of' extra on the DVD and reel back in open-mouthed horror and astonishment at the young stupid boys behind this project.

A director who looks about 20 years old with a wild 'kewpie doll' orange haircut.

A scriptwriter whose loving description of his masterpiece resembles that of a rather thick third-former trying to convince his teacher that his English essay isn't the crock of C-minus doggie-doo that everybody else in the class knows it is.

A shedload of other young 'creatives' all doing their jobs on the set, all indulging themselves in the most criminal waste of money since the banks collapsed on both sides of the Atlantic.

How in the name of God did these talentless berks get a multi-million pound budget to blow on their lamebrain schoolboy drivel?

The final indignity is to watch the 'Making Of' feature and see the likes of Sigourney Weaver, who really should know better, sit there all breathless and wide-eyed and animated, desperately hyping it up as some sort of 'must-see thriller of the year', when she knows and we know and anyone with an ounce of brain cells in his bonce knows she and her fellow stars are vamping up a pile of old bilgewater... and are only babbling in this crazy manner as part of their contractual duties to promote the film.

Each time the story ""reset"" so that you could see it from another vantage point, it was like an entirely new story that gave you more pieces of a puzzle. Like a puzzle, you're given more pieces until you can see the full story. It just became more and more exciting and even nerve wracking because it was an intense story. One segment built upon another, and led to a very exciting and edge of your seat ending. We never found it to be repetitive or boring.

This is a movie that makes you think. The concept of the format was creative and intelligent. Of course it's also full of action, and it has well developed characters that you really come to care about. The acting was excellent.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries, suspense and some action. However you may have to think a bit, so keep that in mind!

I'm not going to mention any details about that Salamanca where people speak (and sometimes even look) like Mexicans, American trucks drive in American highways, a Mexican train makes a nice contrast against a view of the city and so on. Let's focus on that stupid summit with one guy who looks like from the Middle East, another one like an African dictator and an American president raising his arms in a sign of victory in front of a crowd gathered in the same way they would be for the Sunday market (so easy to get in and out of the Plaza Mayor, you can invite all your terrorist friends to join us!). The rest of the plot follows this ""wonderful"" beginning supported by two essential ingredients in similar low quality Hollywood movies: the hero with some dramatic problems (here the thing is apparently some stomachache that makes Dennis Quaid's face turn into something painful from time to time at the beginning of the movie to show us how great a hero he is despite those pains) and second, the little girl (oh, the little girl!): don't miss the part where the Mexican or Centroamerican girl (nothing against any nationality but please, don't tell me you shot the entire movie in Spain!!) is in danger: one of the most pathetic scenes in movie history.

I can't believe there aren't many more 1 star reviews on this horrible movie.

Wow, where do we start. Well, how about with the cell phone. It is fortunate for the free world that the bad guy hadn't completely read the owners manual because it would have meant some serious trouble for the rest of us. I'm sure the phone also has the ability to remotely fly Air Force 1, make the lights go and off in every office building in Spain, and order a pizza at the same time. Controlling a sniper rifle is child's play for that thing.

Do we really believe that the Secret Service is that inept? I've actually known Secret Service guys - that one lone bad guy dude at the end, THAT is the way THEY are. Talking about that super bad dude. Can anyone please explain to me why he put a mask over his face? He kills a squad of highly trained agents, then puts on his mask, kills a dozen more agents to the point where there is NO ONE LEFT (save one) and then he takes off his mask??!!!  Why put it on in the first place???!!!

Then there is the ridiculous child in the movie. As someone else pointed out, these guys kill scores of innocent people but the guy has a case of consciousness at the end and rolls over his vehicle? What?? NO NO NO - a true bad guy (and this guy was) was not going to stop. Terrorists do not brake for Raccoons, squirrels, or little girls.

Why was Weaver in this movie?

I had no idea it was so so easy to place and transport bombs from place to place where the President was going to be. This movie has let out all of its secrets - who knew?

The plot was absolutely ridiculous. These movie makers know NOTHING about security. It is true that most people don't either, but you know watching this movie that even though you may not know much about it, there is common sense. Common sense would tell you that this movie was total crap.

Oh - another thing. Since when would you ever see a Russian, Chinese, or French secret service agent equivalent running through OUR streets, car jacking by simply flashing their Chinese/Russian/French badge, and firing shots into the air after a ""suspect"", who just so happens to be a policeman of OUR country. Heck not only shooting into the air but AT the suspect in a street full of innocent people. ""Our"" innocent people. Would any of us stand for that? Would any country stand for our secret service agents driving down their streets and shooting at people indiscriminately? Secondly, if one of them fires his gun half a dozen times (or was it a dozen, in all of the excitement I lost track myself) you would think they would be good enough to HIT their target. Of course the super bad dude NEVER missed. That is why I call him the ""super"" bad dude.

Do not waste your time with this movie. The trailer showed great promise and I am sure that this ""could"" have been a great movie. What an utter disappointment.

3094494,1,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie sports an all-star cast, but that is about all it has going for it.  Firstly, it is too short for all the action in it yet it still tries to develop characters and that just falls flat. We get about 30 seconds of a character's background.  Secondly, the events are completely unreasonable.  The details of the terrorist attack are just non-sensical considering the amount of the security that occurs in any function involving the President.  A few terrorists kill a troop of secret service men as if those guarding the President were henchman working for Dr. Evil in an Austin Power's movie. Thirdly, no reason is ever given for why a group of hodge-podge Moroccans would kill dozens of innocent people and the President of the USA.  The characters in on the plot could or would never pull it off either.

The worst aspect of the movie is the attempt to create suspense by continually rewinding the events and showing the same time period from about 6-7 different characters' ""vantage points.""  The result is that it completely disrupts any flow the movie would have and prevents viewers from connecting with any of the characters.  All-in-all it leads to only about 15 mins. worth of actual time passing in the movie's events.

The ending also is illogical, not to mention the impossibility of a secret service agent in a high speed chase through unfamilar narrow streets filled with cars and pedstrians, on the sidewalk, down stairs, shifting, sliding, turning, etc and of course making cell phone calls, then getting completely smashed by a big truck and a wall, and surprise..getting out and chasing down the bad guys.",1220140800,7,1633,4.845323741007194
3094495,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I enjoyed this movie, and I enjoyed the gimmick of the film. One of my favorite books is Orson Scott Cards ""Ender's Shadow"", which is exactly the same story as his book ""Enders Game"" except it is told by a different character. While ""Vantage Point"" doesn't rise anywhere near to the books I just mentioned, I like that looking from different viewpoints and vantage points can make a story quite different. In this film, it was interesting trying to figure out who were the bad guys before you see for yourself, and it had the effect of going to a criminal trial, and hearing testimony from different individuals to get at the truth. If that sounds like fun to you, then you will probably like this as well.

On the downside, the story that turned out to be the actual events was quite convoluted, and pretty implausible. Some little things about the main characters motivation were not fleshed out enough to engage an emotional response from the audience.

It was such an adrenaline rush, but the best part about this movie was something you don't see in most movies.

That's the simple way of saying without good memory recall a viewer might get lost in the crowd.  I'd also class this film as one to use with certain rehab patients.  Not joking here - often films have multiple uses as well as audiences.  Another plus with ""Advantage Point"" is the involvement of citizen spectators during a national crisis, a reminder of 9/11.  The tourist becomes a hero just because he/she was filming the surrounding as the fatal attack begins.  Outstanding scenery, plots, characters, and more.

The first hour of the movie is basically a loop of the same action, but from various different perspectives, or Vantage Points, of several key players that witness a diabolical scheme to assassinate The President of the United States.

You may know already that one of my biggest pet peeves is spoilers. I hate spoilers. And I'm not about to write one out here so don't worry. But if you've ever seen the trailer for Vantage Point and then watch the movie, you'll be like, ""why the heck did they give away that critical twist?"" In fact, the trailer for this movie goes so far as to (deliberately) misdirect you into preconceiving who the bad guys are.

But why??? Did the director or producers think that their movie would be too obvious and predictable without the misdirection? I don't think it would have been. On the contrary, the misdirection made Vantage Point seem like it would be another one of the many government conspiracy theory movies. But it's not. And I think that the marketing of this movie contributed to its lackluster box office performance.

Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are great. Forest Whitaker's character is completely unbelievable...as in, it's hard to swallow a single action that Whitaker's character makes.

I rather liked the thriller ""Vantage Point.""  The repetition of the movie's story from the different points of view of the main characters affords the movie a nightmarish quality.  It's like you have to keep reliving a nightmare over and over making it that much more hellish, the tension mounting with each reliving.  You feel trapped with no escape.  You know what's going to happen and there's nothing you can do about it.  The strands of the plot come together plausibly when the ambulance careens toward the little girl on the street, and in the ensuing violence and car crashes the story is resolved satisfactorily.",1218844800,,764,5.846846846846847

The underlying sequence of events is not that substantial (in addition to painfully contrived).  Consequently, the different vantage points have a disproportionate amount of repetition relative to the new information that is layered on.  My reaction at the end was ""Is that all there was?""

Two of the worst, most unforgivable absurdities (see other reviews for many more examples):
1. The bomb does far more damage to a hotel well over a mile away than it does to the immediately surrounding buildings.  This is absolutely essential to the plot.

3094533,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point, a fast-paced, super-charged, action-thriller, stands also as a melodramatic comment on terrorism and politics with alot of pep and plenty of suprises.
  The surprises, possibly being the best selling point of the movie, start out with a trickle-down plotline that returns us to the same terrorist attack numerous times during a massive conference in Spain.  This allows us to see the same tragic moment from several different characters' viewpoints without letting us in on the secret cause of the attack.  Yes, the movie returns to the start quite a few times, and this allows for a bit of foreshadowing as we become involved and engrossed into a Hitchcockian-style timeline (Which means it is full of suspense).
  As the film developes, and the truth behind the suspense becomes apparent, we see more of how climax is used in most movies today.  The difference of Vantage Point is in the flashbacks.  They allow us not to figure out what might happen at the end, but they give us a journey filled with different character actions, plot-lines, dangerous events and impossible situations leading us up to that one horrifying terrorist occurrence.
  The film is colorful and slightly commercial, but it also allows us to feel how frightening it is to deal with the possibility of an assassination attempt of an American President; here played well by top-notch actor William Hurt.
  Dennis Quaid is superb as a paranoid, worried secret service agent, always on the alert as a result of a previously almost-botched attempt on the life of the same President in the '70's.  We feel the Quaid character all-too-well, his rising anxiety and emotions delivered with one of his best performances.
  Forrest Whitaker appears as a lone tourist on vacation who manages to capture several different viewpoints of the same event.  His character is the representation of the hero in us all and he provides a peformance that is dynamic and heroic yet realistic.
  The beautiful and talented Sigourney Weaver makes an appearence as a top news woman covering the event, providing the catalyst for experiencing both the professional yet emotional sides to covering a life-threatening terrorist attack.
  As the movie progresses, no one is quite sure who is on whos' side as a series of twists, double-crosses and betrayals lead up to the final explosive twenty minutes.  When all the characters finally come together and the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit, we are treated to a tremendously fast and violent car chase with Quaid at the wheel in pursuit of the terorists or would-be terrorists.  How the movie will turn out is still left up to our ability to decide who is the true villian behind the attack, as characters, CIA agents, politicians and extras all scramble amidst the beautiful backdrop of Spain.
  Vantage Point may seem similar to the other political/terrorist film of that same year, Rendition, but both differ in their intensity and in how they treat the subject matter of what could go wrong for everyone when terrorist plots can and will strike us all anywhere, anytime.",1217808000,2,3089,4.98828125

3094551,2,B0012QCZ5O,"`Vantage Point' is one of those movies that drew me by its trailer.  At a kinetic pace we see a frenetic adventure as an assassination attempt on the President takes place, while a ""double""** of him has been placed on his behalf on stage at a terrorist summit in Salamanca, Spain.  Interlocking pieces fit together to give us a composite of conspiracy and treachery.  Perhaps having high expectations I was more than a little disappointed with this mystery-thriller ride.  I generally give most movies the benefit of the doubt, for being a news junkie, I find real-life stories often inspire or scotch what we see on the screen. ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" I often quote.  This time there are definitely some credibility issues afoot.

Many witnesses see the assassination attempt of  President Ashland (William Hurt).  On the platform in Plaza Mayor are two secret service agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and Taylor (Matthew Fox), overseeing all danger signs.  In the square is bearded Enrique (Eduardo Noriega).  He looks like a revolutionary, but must be a plain-clothes police officer.  When the President's double is shot, he rushes the stage.  Is it treachery?  Or is it duty?  Connected to him is Veronica (Ayelet Zurer).  Together they talk about another man.  Is she seeing someone else?  Or is he their sinister connection?  Time will tell.  She has connections with Javier (Edgar Ramirez) who must be the other man.  More ambiguity fills their conversation.

Also in attendance is Howard, an American tourist with a video camera.  He's left his wife behind to tour Europe, and now he's getting everything on tape.  He meets a woman when he bumps into her little girl and offers to buy her a new ice cream cone.  Another point-of-view is provided by GNN (Global News Network) headed by program manager, Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  After the attempt, Agent Barnes bursts into their headquarters watching the tragedy on tape.  Often times what Barnes sees is hidden from us--to be revealed at a later time.  Meanwhile, one of the characters is desperately trying to get his brother released as a hostage.

I have to give the film some credit for ingenuity.  They have showcased another flashy format in their approach.  Trouble is we don't really get to know the characters.  Before we get a chance to love or loathe them, the movie backs up about fifteen minutes to show us the proceedings from another's eyes.  Unlike, say '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/6305161968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>' where we truly care about the angst in people's lives, all we can do here is commiserate their situations.  (If you thought 'Crash' was too coincidental, just wait until you get a load of this.)  Tragically, this spills over into the ""whodunit"" or puzzle portion of the film's alleged draw.  If some of the narrative is meant to give us ""clues"" as to the guilty parties, it becomes a ""tacked-on"" exercise during the revelations of the denouement.  There are few ""ah-ha's"" in the resolution.

I also have problems with Horace.  He captures everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on tape.  What he doesn't film on his video camera, he makes up by being there for the continuing drama.  Always at the right place at the right time.  There are lucky Pulitzer Prize winning journalists with luck less than his.  And what about the double?  I've seen Hollywood doubles, and there's a resemblance.  Sigourney Weaver or at least somebody would catch it, but, no, William Hurt's clone is on stage.  After the mayor makes a gracious speech, the President always says something.  At least, ""Gracias"".  Of course he gets shot, but what were they planning to do if he didn't get shot?  Does he do impressions of the President as well?

The acting?  One of the biggest challenges I believe an actor faces is facing a tragedy.  After all, how many ways can you say, ""Oh, my Gawd!""?  Forest Whitaker gets my vote for the best in this high-tech puzzler, but Sigourney Weaver delivers her usual goods as well.  I can't say I'm inspired either way about the rest, but again I try to fit myself in their shoes:  The how to muster the awful-without-sounding-like-it actor's syndrome.

With all the grandiose deception, I have to use a word I've never used before:  contrived.  Yes, I hate that deadly word, for I'd hate to be responsible for being wrong.  It's like an assassination of a movie, so I've never used it before---until now.  You have to be careful.  It's not something to use lightly.

3094554,5,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT was a movie whose preview seemed to play nearly every time I went to the theater. So much so that by the time the movie was released I was tired of seeing it. A major mistake on my point as this was one of the most thrilling movies I've seen in years.

The film revolves around a visit by the US President (William Hurt) to a conference on terrorism in Spain. Several countries have agreed to back his proposal in and effort to stop the killing. As the President walks to the podium in an open air square where the conference is taking place, he is shot by an assassin's bullet. This starts the film.

But there is more to it than that. As the title states, the film is offered from various vantage points of the same scene. The opening scene is offered via a news network's truck as it watches the carnage that happens when the President is not only shot but a bomb blows up in the public square.

Through them we are introduced to Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and lead Agent Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox). These are the agents in charge of protecting the President, a job Barnes knows well as less than a year earlier he took a bullet while protecting him. On edge and looking for signs of trouble, Barnes' sharp eye and instincts kick in just before the shot is fired.

But Barnes' perception is not the last we are offered. We are also given the viewpoint of Enrigue (Eduardo Noriega), a policeman who becomes suspect by the Secret Service when he rushes the podium to protect the President. Another view is offered through the eyes of vacationer Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) who is filming all he sees with his new camcorder. An important view is that of the President himself when we learn it was not him but his double who took the bullet! The last view offered is that of the terrorists whose job was to kill the President...or was it?

Each section takes a 23 minute time period and condenses it to offer the varying viewpoints of each character. And with each differing viewpoint we as viewers ourselves are offered more clues as to just who is behind the assassination attempt. Until the last view offered I had no firm idea.

Movies have been called white knuckle rides but this movie fulfills that line to a T. The breakneck pace of the film, while showing us the same basic scene over and over, holds you in its grip not just for the carnage that ensues but because of the action that follows. Leads are discovered and agents set in motion as they try to capture the person responsible.

Many people have claimed that THE FRENCH CONNECTION or BULLIT or lately the Bourne films have offered the greatest car chases of all times. I think that title can now be taken by the stunt drivers in this film. Moving at breakneck speed through tiny streets that are little more than alleys filled with pedestrians and cars takes your breath away.

All performances are top of the line. While Quaid's might seem one note, that is actually the demeanor of Secret Service agents. Their job IS to protect the President and nothing more. It happens in this film. High speed, explosive and breathtaking are all apt descriptions of this movie.

Unfortunately I did just that and when I came back I found the repeated story telling (from a different vantage point) too tiresome. Unlike the Denzel Washington starrer ""Courage Under Fire"" which also used the Rashomon effect, Vantage Point is in more agreement with the Rashomon effect because the incidents from each vantage point adhere to the truth than falsehood that the characters of the former movie confess. The screenplay can get boring due to the repeated story telling but towards the end all is compensated with the twist which was worth the some-what tiresome wait. Crowd participation and control in the outdoor scenes were good too. Filming mostly outdoors is challenging but it is done well in Vantage Point.

Vantage Point is a good movie for Dennis Quaid. His role reminds one of Clint Eastwood who played a similar role in ""In the line of Fire"".I also wondered why some senior actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Forest Whitaker to some extent, had very small roles to play. There is one very good car chase. Spain is beautifully pictured. Nice to see William Hurt back in popular movies these days.

Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to dwell on the supposed GLARING shortcomings of the film.  I suspect some ""critics"" are conditioned/programmed to be oh so discerning that they can't see the forest for the trees - this was a thrilling, action-packed, and rather clever way of looking at an intense incident and is an excellent example of the age-old adage that truth is relative.

3094578,3,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point is a slick thriller that uses a gimmick to tell an intriguing story about an attack on a terrorism summit in Spain. William Hurt is President Ashton and is about to speak to a gathered crowd in a large outdoor plaza. He's killed by two gunshots. With the crown panicked, an explosion goes off in the disance. Moments later, a large bomb detonates underneath the podium where the President had been speaking. The movie starts with the gimmick, showing the assassination and then bomb explosion from the point of view of Sigourney Weaver. Weaver is directing the coverage of the event in an control truck for the Global News Network. The movie then portrays the events of the attack from several point of views: Secret Service Agent Dennis Quaid who is just coming back on duty after being injured saving the president; Forrest Whitaker, a kind heart tourist, a spanish police officer, the president, the terrorist leader, etc. I lost track of how many points of view are utilized.

This movie should be watched just for the uniqueness of the storytelling. It's not groundbreaking or earth shattering, but it should keep your interest. Some scenes are repeated during each point of view shift, and its fun to pick out bits and pieces you've already seen and see how they relate.

That is how this movie is, times 6, because of the 6 different vantage points that the film is based on.  Not until you get to the last box that you are unwrapping do you see how all of the parts fit together, and that is really what spins this movie.  There is plenty of action which keeps this films constantly moving, and one thing that I did like is when each vantage point is rolled back and the time starts over.

Quaid, is secret service guarding the president, while Whitaker is a tourist on vacation filming the summit. What transpires before the president is shot is as though several cameras filmed the action and then they are all rewound and watched one-by-one with them starting at 12:00. At first this is not an issue but by the fifth or sixth segment you may be ready to fast forward the movie, don't or you will miss some key dialogue.

3094584,3,B0012QCZ5O,"There is no argument that first-time feature director Pete Travis maneuvers this 2008 action thriller with propulsive intensity throughout its surprisingly fleet ninety-minute running time, but contrivance and coincidence seem to be the two guiding forces behind the overly tricked-out screenplay by first-time screenwriter Barry L.

The concept starts promisingly as it aspires to be a contemporary take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>, Akira Kurosawa's classic melodrama about the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy. Under the guise of a political thriller, however, the film only replicates one part of Kurosawa's cinematic equation - showing the multiple perspectives of the participants to a traumatic event - without really addressing the complexity behind the individual perceptions. The basis of the differences in perspective lies wholly within the facts to which each participant is exposed.

This all occurs over a twenty-three-minute period, and it is first seen most effectively through the eyes of a CNN-type news crew led by veteran news producer Rex Brooks. Their viewpoint ends when their onsite reporter is killed in the bombing. The movie is strong in a pulpy way up to this point, but then we see the same series of events six times over. The second perspective shows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor on active duty. Just back after recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by another presidential assassination attempt a year earlier, Barnes is especially anxiety-driven during the events that unfold.

The third viewpoint is that of a Spanish police officer named Enrique who may or may not have a connection to the terrorists involved. By the time we see the same events a fourth time, the novelty has genuinely worn off as we see everything again from American tourist Howard Lewis' perspective and then once again from the President himself. These particular episodes spin into an incredulous series of circumstances that lead to the final viewpoint represented by the terrorists themselves. The plot finally moves forward in time once we are privy to what all the participants experience. Performances prove to be secondary in a labyrinth thriller like this, although Dennis Quaid registers the most as the tortured and heroically persistent Barnes, and William Hurt shows true executive lan in the surprisingly meaty role of Ashton. Forest Whitaker valiantly attempts to make the most of a no-win role as Lewis as his character becomes more far-fetched. A similar problem befalls Matthew Fox as Taylor, but Sigourney Weaver has no problem acting authoritative in a near-cameo as Brooks during the best ten minutes of the movie.

An international supporting cast fills the remaining key roles expertly - Spain's Eduardo Noriega, Venezuela's dgar Ramirez, France's Sad Taghmaoui (Amir's driver in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kite-Runner/dp/B0012OX7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kite Runner</a>), and Israel's Ayelet Zurer (Avner's wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munich/dp/B000F1IQN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munich</a>). Interestingly, while the plot could have been fodder for an anti-Bush political diatribe, the film holds back from such easy targets. The downside, however, is a murkiness in character motivation that is never really clarified beyond the basic good-versus-bad dynamics. Features on the 2008 DVD are pretty standard with Travis going solo on the film's commentary track. While he provides insight, interactive dialogue with Levy or some of the principal cast could have held more interest. The making-of featurette, ""An Inside Perspective"" runs nearly a half-hour and provides the standard back-slapping from cast and crew as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The sixteen-minute ""Plotting an Assassination"" seems repetitive even with the focus purely on the script and the characters. The seven-minute ""Coordinating Chaos"" focuses on the elaborate stunts, especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/6304698526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>-style car chase that was filmed in Mexico City doubling for Salamanca.

The movie illuminates some of the major problems with not only the United States but also the world's handling of diplomacy, information transfer, terrorism, and law enforcement.

3094587,4,B0012QCZ5O,"This is a movie that plays with your perceptions and expectations.  William Hurt plays the President of the United States in a time of Global Terror.  He attends a conference in Spain and is shot.  Dennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service Agent who is brought back for this event after being shot and nearly losing his life a year earlier.

The first half of the movie shows us the event, rewinds and shows us events from another person's point of view, and does that four times (as I recall).  After that we think we have the pieces together and the movie tells its narratives as some of the previous views converge for different reasons.  I really don't want to say any more about the plot.

I thought it was a pretty good and entertaining movie.  Quaid gives a solid performance as a serious, brave, but understandably tentative agent.  William Hurt is good in his smallish role.  Forest Whitaker gives the movie an emotional center.  Sigourney Weaver, Bruce McGill, Matthew Fox, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, and several others fill out a really good cast.

While not a great film, it is worth seeing.

On the negative side of the ledger I think the relentless rewind back in time to the events just prior to the terrorist attack was relentless and overdone, ultimately distracting the focus of the audience to such an extent as to cause them to lose interest in the eventual outcome.

The other bothersome and most unbelievable part of the storyline was the role of the American tourist (Forest Witaker) and his always in the right spot with the perfect camera angle luck. How that camera always happened to be aimed in the right direction and stay in focus was a miracle in itself.

Overall good for one watch but please don't ask me to sit through it again. Be sure to have a large cup of coffee before viewing, it's the only way you'll be able to keep up with the action.

3094599,4,B0012QCZ5O,"This film is unique to me in how the plot unfolds. Quickly I knew that some people were not who they claimed to be, but I was still surprised over and over again. The plot is quite complicated actually. You're good if you watch it only once and walk away understanding the motives of each character and his or her role in the entire event. I myself watched it once and then watched the second half over again because it was about half-way through that things got hairy. To me, though, this only adds to the film. I consider it even better if I need to watch a movie more than once to fully understand it (consider Memento). Please note this movie is not nearly on the level of the complexity of Memento, though.
I gave the movie 4 stars because I thought the plot was a bit spotty, and I feel in the end that it has holes in it. Maybe I'm just not smart enough. Could be. But...you also get the typical Hollywood deaths - here one person dies conveniently instantly while another lives to speak a few important lines. Some people are killed with just a knife to the back, and sometimes one hit is all it takes to bring down a guy. You get the classic rag-over-the-mouth-guy-passes-out capture and take down. Silly. So the deaths could have been more realistic. Still, it is Hollywood.
Anyway, bottom line: you have to see this movie. The story lacks depth, but the intricacies of the ploy are fantastic and figuring out the roles of each person is a blast. For the people who completely hated it, you were probably just utterly confused. So, if you're not to keen and quick-witted, you might want to avoid this movie.",1215734400,,1617,4.429530201342282

Of course, all the Spanish drivers were too much in a hurry for, I dunno, any of them to stop or *gasp* slow down because a idiot girl keeps walking into traffic.

Naturally, GNN (Global Network News) has a huge crew on the scene.  The on the ground producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) is trying to keep things running smoothly.  Just as President Ashton (William Hurt) steps up to the stage, he is shot.  As the jittery crowd begins to react, there is an explosion.

Back up to the beginning of the events.  Two secret service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox) are at the President's hotel.  They accompany him to the town square and are standing on stage.  Tom (Dennis Quaid) is convinced he saw something from an upstairs window.  Just as other agents report it was just a fan, the President is shot.  Tom quickly grabs the camera of a tourist in the crowd (Forest Whitaker) to see if he captured any pertinent information while the other agent tries to catch the shooter who they think was in a different window.

Back up to the beginning of the events....

They flip back and forth several times, each time giving us the events from a slightly different point of view and leaving us with another cliffhanger.  Finally, they begin to show us how all these different points of view come together.

Sort of.

The movie starts out using the multiple points of view well.  With each retelling of the events, we see a slightly different piece of the puzzle.  How all these events fit together is left up in the air until the end.

But it's the end where the unique storytelling falls apart.  While all of our main characters play a part in the climax, only we know how.  I was a little disappointed with that because I was expecting all the characters to work together to find the solution.  Instead, coincidence ruled the day.

I found the repetitive flashbacks interesting at first, but eventually annoying.  It spends an hour on stuff we already know, just giving us a small bit of new information every time.  But when we get beyond that, the pay off is worth it.  The action isn't believable, but I was glued to my seat as the climax unfolded.

Here's a brief aside for you.  Part of the background color of the movie is a bunch of anti-America protesters.  That's fine.  But twice as they panned across the crowd, I clearly saw a sign that had a W crossed out.  The current US President has nothing to do with anything in the film.  Either the producers just used some footage from a protest and didn't catch that or they were trying to sneak in a political statement.  Which ever it was, I found it distracting.

Once the film got into the point of view of President Ashton (William Hurt) the movie actually had a fairly good payoff, only to be ultimately ruined in the end, but I'll get to that. Once Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) puts his finger on the pulse of the assassination attempt and multiple bombings, after a god-awful amount of rewinds that have us watching the movie from multiple VANTAGE POINTS, the movie kicks into high gear with an exciting hotel room scene, an intense car chase and a coincidental finalle that ruined it all.

The rewinds, I believe there are 6, while interesting in an EXPERIMENTAL way, fail miserably, ultimately frustrating the viewer and wishing they could fast forward to the end. Yet, when they finally got to the Presidents POV, I realized, yes, the rewinding was frustrating and disjoining, but there actually was a pretty cool movie hidden here, with doubles, double-crosses and terrorism, and once the action and answers starting kicking in, I thought... If they had just told the movie without the experimental film school junk, this could have been a cool movie.

Then... of course, you throw in the coincidental ending that basically had everybody involved in the plot, and solving the plot colliding in the exact same intersection underneath an overpass. Even though, there was a crazy car chase and some guy on foot arrived at the location a good 5 minutes before guys in an ambulance, despite looking at each other back at the collisium.

We have a single episode of political terrorism told from the varying perspectives of the participants, which I found very fresh and inventive.

As we switch viewpoints, bits and pieces of the plot unfold in a creative manner. There's plenty of shoot-'em-ups, car chases, foot chases, bad guys (and politically incorrect ones, too, which was surprising), sympathy characters (a little girl in jeopardy)... the production team really covered all the bases on this one.

The difference in this thriller from the many others of the same genre is the use of telling the story from at least five different vantage points - the news reporters (Sigourney Weaver, Zo Saldana and Staff), the CIA (Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, et al with William Hurt as the President), a group of terrorists, an American bystander with camera (Forest Whitaker), and the viewing public.  Things are not as they initially seem and the more times the story is rerun through repetition of the incident, the more information is added.

Based on a story by Barry Levy and directed by Pete Travis the film could become tiresome in its use of repeated reruns, but given the quality of the cast and the twists and turns as the 'plot' is further elucidated makes the story more of an investigation of Intelligence forces from all involved countries and drives home the reason 'terrorism' is so terrifying.  Some of the peripheral cast members are particularly fine - Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui,  Ayelet Zurer, and Eduardo Noriega among others.

In terms of redeeming factors, there are some truly hilarious moments, such as the car chase where Dennis Quaid succeeds in driving one-handed through miles of narrow streets at high speeds while making non-stop cell phone calls and surviving, unscathed, some nasty crashes. Apparently, driving and talking on a cell phone is safer than we've been led to believe. We can only hope our actual Secret Service agents are one tenth as competent (and lucky!) as Quaid. And, we can only hope that someday, our actual President is as worthy of the effort as the mythical one in this story.

I wish this movie had been made by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, or anyone else, with at least one foot in the real world. No such luck... but in the end, one dollop of entertainment was discovered, as I howled my way through the apparently sincere comments by the cast and filmmakers in the special features.

3094627,2,B0012QCZ5O,"The first five minutes of Vantage Point start off strong and with a bang (no pun intended), as Sigourney Weaver and a crew of news producers sit inside a control room, ready to go live with reporters on the scene of a high-profile presidential appearance in Spain. As Weaver gets into a petty squabble with one reporter (Zoe Saldana) over the tone she chose to take in a live shot, a gunshot fires, hitting the president, and the crew scrambles to cover it. The pacing picks up significantly, as it begins to match the panic-mode of the people in the square, and then comes the one-two punch of an explosion at the base of the hotel in the center of the events. Travis chooses to introduce these events-- the ones that supposedly set up the course for the whole film-- to his audience through the limited angles this crew's cameras are able to capture, and in doing so, he doesn't allow us access to all of the information just yet. The give a little, hold a lot back approach of Vantage Point shows great potential, but unfortunately it gets old quickly and just ends up frustrating the viewers.

It's painfully obvious what is really going on from the first few minutes of Vantage Point-- in part because the majority of the plot is covered neatly in the promotional trailers but also due to the fact that the script is just not imaginative, and the plot is quite thin overall-- meaning, the stereotypical bad guys are the bad guys; there are no twists here.  Barry Levy, a former teacher who sold Vantage Point as his first screenplay, sets up a few points (such as the fact that the president used a double for his appearance and therefore didn't actually get shot) that-- if the film was allowed to play out past the course of the same two violent events over and over and over-- would actually offer interesting and unique commentary. It would have been great to see the ramifications after the realization that the public had been duped; it would have been something rooted in reality and just tongue-in-cheek enough to elicit smiles. Instead, Levy's sophomoric style keeps the audience five steps ahead of the movie at any given moment, eliminating any real reason to keep watching.

The film is full of filler, offering the same sequences from varying angles and POVs-- from Secret Service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox), to a civilian with a video camera (Forest Whitaker) who just happens to be in the right place at the right time, to an up-and-coming terrorist (Said Taghmaoui, who is really too talented for this kind of typecasting).  Between the repetition, the slo-mo, the rewind sequences in between POVs, and the ungodly amount of running, there is no real plot-- just a whole lot of fast motion. The script must have been only twenty pages long and therefore would have made a really clever, really innovative short... or even a web series.

Vantage Point boasts a huge cast of name talent, none of with whom Travis seemed to know what to do.  Only Quaid and Whitaker have backstories, as simple as they may be, because Travis instead chooses to focus on convoluted action, muddying the importance of his wide net of supporting players and making the majority of them much more expendable than they perhaps should be.  There is really nothing at stake for any of them other than ""stay alive,"" and the few attempts at character connection or dimension-- most of which are given to Whitaker-- are too on the nose, as if Levy doesn't trust his audiences enough to read facial expressions, and Travis doesn't trust his actors to give the right ones. Levy tells when he should show; when Whitaker is alone, he mutters to himself ridiculously, unrealistically, and expositionally. There are actual, audible ""Oh my Gods"" spilling from these awestruck characters' mouths, and suddenly six-foot-tall, hulking men are reduced to melodramatic seventh grade girls.  It's fitting, really, that in a film about deception, corruption, and violence, the filmmakers themselves proved to be similarly paranoid control freaks, unable to allow their actors just to do their own thing.

Far too much is by ""chance"" in this film, again namely with Whitaker, who happens to stumble all wide-eyed and slack-jawed onto just about everything. Dennis Quaid, too, though, just happens to have luck and timing on his side, finding pieces of the puzzle literally one after the other just dropped at his side, which is really just typical of the arc a once-fallen hero desperate to redeem himself takes in films like Vantage Point.  Everything just comes too ""easily.""  Travis is far too distracted by manufacturing suspense to focus on the huge holes and just expects his audience to be willing to suspend their disbelief enough to join him on this ""convenient"" journey.

Vantage Point's concept is clever, and its effort is certainly admirable, but it was just too big for these green filmmakers, and unfortunately they got caught up in the flashy style and eliminated all substance.  The result, which is just laughable when it isn't intended to be a comedy, would have been much more successful if it was half its length-- and at only ninety minutes, that's certainly saying something.",1214524800,,5185,4.8386004514672685

A suspected terrorist is running for his very life through the streets of Madrid, and a team of crack Secret Service agents in top physical condition are chasing him on foot--for blocks and blocks, through high speed traffic and up and down the sides of buildings.  And there's Forest Whitaker, bringing up the rear all right, but only slightly, a camcorder glued to his eye, not even breathing hard.  He just keeps going and going, this tubby guy, he's like the energizer beach ball.  I just didn't believe that Forest Whitaker of all people was up for the role of persistent sprinter.  Why not get Lance Armstrong or someone?  Did they hope to take advantage of Whitaker's acting talents?  He didn't take them on location, must have left them back at home in the USA.

They must have had Sigourney Weaver for fifteen minutes; she's on the screen so little I was convinced this was an elaborate coverup and that Forest Whitaker would pause, duck behind a Moorish pillar, and strip off the Forest makeup as emerge as Ripley from Alien.  She might as well have been the secret head of the terrorist ring, it would make about as much sense as what did happen.  So go with the fun and don't expect a good movie, just a broad strokes one.

3094639,2,B0012QCZ5O,"It is difficult to explain  how extremely nonsensical the plot of this movie is, without spoiling it. So let me simply point out some side oddities.

- A speech by the president of the USA, the mayor of Madrid, and several international dignataries is set in the boxed, sniper-friendly environment of Plaza Mayor, with hundreds of private balconies looking directly at close range into the  main stage, a logistical and security nightmare.

- American secret service personnel can boss around Spanish civilians and law enforcement alike, just by shouting ""policia"" (with the stress in the wrong syllable) and waving a gun. They can adventure way outside they retinue and chase civilians who are clearly Spanish, even engage in a high-speed chase of a Spanish police car, but no one of the abundant local police or snipers hinders them in any way.
By the way, it is possible to sustain a 10-minute car chase in the streets (and walkays) of Madrid without braking one single time, and without running over a single pedestrian.

- Spain has only one street, that ends in the country's only one highway. And all walking paths of every important character end, also, in one precise point of that highway.

- Terrorists able to devise very sophisticated plans, prove to be incredibly stupid in key, very simple parts of their execution.
Also, they can act ruthlessly and fanatically all the time, but have isolated pangs of conscience for no other reason than to suit the plot.
Finally, being almost all of them Spaniards, they will speak some Spanish among themselves to add local color, but then suddenly switch to English for no apparent reason.
Trained and motivated terrorists are so scarce, that the only guy available for the heavy duty work has to be coerced into it by unverisimilar means. And, aside from his incredible killing efficiency, he's pretty stupid otherwise.

- American secret servicemen in the middle of a national security crisis of epic proportions have time to peek around the inside of vehicles on a car crash, for no apparent reason.

The premise of the movie is repeating the same series of events from the point of view of several protagonists.
As the perspectives add up, the plot is supposed to start ""making sense"".

3094640,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I have a problem with the way this movie reached its climax.  Before the terrorists crashed the ambulance, they've already caused the death of dozens of people, indiscriminately through two bombings, and discriminately through shootings.  The woman, in particular, has shot ""Cameraman no. 2"", a co-conspirator, at close range, in cold blood, inside the ambulance (how she did that without flinching from the terrible noise, and how she never lost her hearing from such a blast inside an enclosed space, I'll never know).  So it puzzles me why in the end she had an attack of ""conscience"" and yanked the steering wheel to avoid hitting the girl, thereby rolling the ambulance and causing her own death, that of her co-terrorist (the ringleader), ending the car chase and saving the life of the president.

The concept of the movie (which is hinted at in the title) is what especially makes Vantage Point a compelling and unique film; I won't address the pattern it revolves around directly since it comes as a nice surprise, but the vantage points by which the movie progresses are very entertaining and suspenseful. Just when I thought I had figured out everything about what was going on, I was not even close. Plenty of twists, thrilling action scenes, and surprises make this movie a must-see. The acting is all tremendous as well; my only criticisms would be the tendency of the film to have parts which were incredibly unrealistic. These parts still contributed to the entertaining nature of Vantage Point, however, and so they didn't bother me much.

I normally like studmiesters like Dennis Quaid, but why oh why did he take the money for this laughable Tuesday morning?  Sigourney Weaver fans take note, her performance in this film (I have to swallow hard to even call it that) amounts to precious little more than an extended cameo.  Forest Whitaker, after seeing him in such tremendous roles as ""Last King of Scotland"" and his recurring character on the magnificent television series ""The Shield"", is a crushing disappointment as a man with a video camera who catches the preposterous proceedings on a video camera.

The gimmick of showing a political assassination from multiple characters' perspectives is intriguing, to say the least (and I am, in fact, fond enough of both red and white wine). But the tricky part, as evidenced in this outrageous mistake of a movie, is in the execution. Everytime the movie 'rewinds' to the beginning of the story to show another characters' perspective, ripples of unintentional laughter rang out loud and clear throughout the cinema.

When ""Rashomon"" showed the same event from different viewpoints, the event as described was very different to each person...the point being that reality is subjective, and as a main character remarks ""all men lie"".  ""Vantage Point"" merely shows the same event as seen by different people, the only difference being what they happened to see or be exposed to.  As such it is a presentation/storytelling technique, not a philosophical statement.

With that out of the way, I actually thought ""Vantage Point"" was better than I had expected.  Excessive car chase, over the top acting, coincidences and resolutions, but as American movies go it didn't suck.

Problem with this film is as I have pointed out its been done a million times before and is just frankly getting boring now (Imagine watching 24 with even less interest and you get the idea) We have the disgruntled secret serviceman who has previously ""took a bullet"" for the president but never quite recovered, family man American on holiday who when not filming the whole event gets on with the locals and even saves a few of them, hard sell camera crew (Changed CNN to GNN)they even seemed to pick the darkest Spanish people to be as support actors (Was that just to emphasise to the American audience that this was Spain?)

So we have unknown terrorist group whose goal is never quite explained (Though they do appear to have an Arabic name and a base in ""friendly"" Morocco.  I guess just giving us that was enough to convince us of their ""badness"") Plan an elaborate terrorist attack (If these people do have this kind of planning then God help us all!) with a multi national group with an end aim that is just as unexplained as the actual goals of the organisation itself.  Running chase, so called twist to the tale, not so subtle hints as to who the bad guys are and you pretty much have the plot (Not that there is much of one)  We are even given a moving speech from the president who refuses to retaliate to the bomb attack with a military strike because that would be ""Just what these people want"" and encourages his advisers to stick with the conference (Was this supposed to be some kind of ""What could have been"" Post 9/11) Either way it becomes a mute point when his advisers get gunned down 2 seconds later.

As its title suggests, ""Vantage Point"" is all about the unique perspective each of us brings to the events we witness.  To explore this theme, the movie employs the old ""Rashomon"" technique of telling the same story from the viewpoint of a half dozen or so characters present at the scene.  The incident in this case is the attempted assassination of the President of the United States at an anti-terrorism summit being held in Salamanca, Spain, an event at which two massive bombs are also detonated.  In Barry Levy`s screenplay, each angle of the story functions much like an individual piece in a giant jigsaw puzzle, the full picture of which comes fully clear only after each element has been successfully fitted and secured in its proper place.

""Vantage Point"" features a large cast of well-known actors, including William Hurt as the President; Dennis Quaid and Michael Fox as secret service agents; Sigourney Weaver as a TV news producer; Forest Whitaker as an American tourist; Zoe Saldana as a news reporter; and Eduardo Noriega, Edgar Ramirez and Ayelet Zurer as Spanish terrorists (the Spaniards definitely get the short end of the stick in this movie).

Despite the deliberately fragmented nature of the narrative, the main focus of the film falls on Quaid's character, an agent who less than a year earlier took a bullet for the President and who is now returning to his job an obviously shaken and high strung man.

Directed by Pete Travis, ""Vantage Point"" is a high octane political thriller that gets the job done without ever distinguishing itself overmuch.  By constantly returning to the same event (the movie sometimes feels like a somber remake of ""Groundhog Day"") and relating the story through so many eyewitnesses, the film sacrifices some of its character development for sheer narrative pyrotechnics.  Still, the storytelling is occasionally ingenious and Travis keeps the action percolating along at a fast enough clip to keep us from noting the sometimes farfetched and overwrought nature of much of what the movie is showing us (it also points up just how many nefarious things one can presumably do with an iphone these days).  There`s even a humdinger of a car chase through the beautiful streets of Salamanca that is sure to get the adrenalin pumping, even if the mind is left reeling by its overall implausibility.

""Vantage Point"" may have you rolling your eyes from time to time in confusion and disbelief, especially towards the end of the movie, but it is at least guaranteed to keep you entertained for the ninety or so minutes it takes to tell its story.",1205625600,2,2603,4.933638443935926
3094659,4,B0012QCZ5O,"The Kurosawa film ROSHOMON showed the same incident from three different perspectives and Vantage Point uses the same technique but less effectively than Kurosawa did.  However, this is an adrenalin junkies dream film. It has a very thin plot but then the entire film spans a period of less than a half hour as it shows the assassination of the President from several different perspectives.  However, these perspectives are not totally different views of the same incident as much as they are parallel events that are occuring simultaneously.  So the entire film pivots on the assassination and the subsequent events that happen immediately following.  There is an overlong car chase with all of the usual (and seemingly de rigeur) crashes and smashes.  This could have been shortened but it seemed to have been extended only to add time to the otherwise short film, which has very little plot and almost no character development.  Quaid does a good job and Forrest Whitaker is excellent as usual.  Hurt -- in the role of President manages to get the political (America is evil) subtext in which seems to infect almost all recent films.  It is made quite clear that America is prone to attacking anyone who gets in our way and the Presidential advisors are a bunch of jingoistic war mongers. But this is really only a small segment of the film and can be written off as the usual Hollywood left leaning dumbness.  The Muslims are never actually named as Muslims but there is no doubt left as to who they are.  They are astonishingly well equipped, well educated, and technically savvy.  However, in keeping with the reality of the Muslim cause their motivation seems rather vague other than murder and mayhem because they shoot and kill with reckless abandon. They clearly are only focused on their objective and willing to kill hundreds of innocent people in their hatred of America and the West, much like Hamas and Hezbollah who kill and murder innocent people simply to keep their cause on the front pages.  I lost track of the dead agents and of course the dead Spaniards were impossible to count.

However, this is a film that moves very rapidly and each vantage point leaves you hanging until the very end when all of the various perspectives merge into a conclusion.  Overall I thougt this was a fun film -- in spite of the violence -- and it certainly will get your adrenalin flowing.  I gave it four stars because it really is a very thin plot and motivations are vague to non-existent -- still it worth seeing.",1205280000,,2522,4.752293577981652
3094660,2,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" is a film that I really had no prior knowledge of. The only thing I knew was that it dealt with a presidential assassination and that it was told from different perspectives, but that was it. I went into the theater with an open mind and came out let down. For as much as director Pete Travis milks the gimmick of showing an assassination from different views, he never really finds a way to make it riveting, exciting, or truly entertaining.

President Ashton (William Hurt) of the United States comes to Spain to speak at a terrorism summit. As he's about to make his speech, shots ring out and the President is on the ground. The entire film then focuses on certain people in the area, who either witnessed or planned the attack. From a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) to a tourist (Forest Whitaker), each view is shown before, during, and after the assassination, which pieces the clues together about who is responsible and why they are doing it.

For a film like ""Vantage Point"" to work, it needs to be smart. Unfortunately, it's not. By throwing many paper-thin characters into the mix, the writer probably tried to confuse the viewer and make everything seem complex, when all the while it's quite simple. As the movie progressed, I would call what would happen next and who the bad guys were. Almost 95% of the time I was right and it really just made the film seem lazy.

The characters in the film were fairly one-dimensional. Luckily, a solid cast was there to make them slightly interesting. In my mind, Dennis Quaid is one of the most underrated actors in film. He seems to make every film he's in better than it should be (even ""Jaws 3-D""). Even though I would have liked more development with his character, he does a great job and makes his scenes the most interesting. Poor Matthew Fox. ""You know what's interesting about him? ...Nothing."" Oh, how right Seth Rogen was in ""Knocked Up"". The same can be said for his performance. William Hurt does a fine job with what he had to do. Not much was required. Forest Whitaker didn't do much for me, which is disappointing due to how much I enjoyed him in ""The Last King of Scotland"". He had a lot of ""off"" moments throughout the film. And, Sigourney Weaver...she picked up a paycheck.

The idea of different perspectives to show one occurrence is interesting, but it's not executed properly. First, by having so many characters, the audience cannot relate with anyone in the film. With less perspectives, there would be more time for character development, which would have benefited this film. Secondly, the director cheats the audience by not giving the true perspective of each individual. For instance, a character may have been nowhere near the assassination, but when the shots are heard, they cut away to a scene of the president being shot. If the character is not allowed to see the incident visually, neither should the audience. In a way, it's like breaking the fourth wall and it takes you out of the film. Finally, as each story progresses, one can tell that the director is leaving out certain clues that the audience is not allowed to pick up until later in the film. If a character sees something that shocks them or makes them run away, the director may hold out on what they saw until the end so that the audience will be even more shocked supposedly. Again, this doesn't work for me, because we, the audience, are supposed to see their perspectives and by not showing the catalyst of their actions, it's breaking the promise that the film gave to the viewers.

Overall, ""Vantage Point"" is a forgettable thriller. Nothing stands out to separate it from anything else being offered in film these days. It's unfortunate, because it could have been much better. If the characters had been more developed, the writing and direction tighter, the gimmick better executed, and the conclusion more satisfying, we would have had a solid film on our hands.",1205020800,2,3946,4.704775687409551
3094661,3,B0012QCZ5O,"Telling a story (or stories) from multiple viewpoints has been done many times. You remember Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or probably you have seen some of Tarantino's films that employ the device quite effectively or Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing."" But I'm afraid in ""Vantage Point"" things went too far because it includes as many as eight characters' perspectives, or stories, to tell.

You think it's repetitious? It is, but be patient as I explain it later. Anyway, the story of ""Vantage Point"" centers on the assassination of President of the United States (William Hurt) visiting Spain for international anti-terrorism conference. The cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver.

After you witness the assassination scene from one character's viewpoint (from American traveler, secret agent, and so on), the camera suddenly freezes and starts to rewind, going back in time to the point where the film just began. Frankly this is s bit annoying to most viewers (including me), so every time the film starts rewinding, you may hear someone behind you groan in theater. Well, I think I did groan once or more.

Each new take of the story shows the events from another perspective, but few of them really surprise us, not knowing how to illuminate the incidents in a truly refreshing fashion. The film only slowly adds new keys to the story - hidden identities and motives, etc. - but these truths are not particular interesting, and if you are fans of action films, I believe you can predict most of the twists and turns of the convoluting plot.

Fortunately the latter half of the film gets faster and better with car chases and actions that become more and more hectic as the film goes on.

Yet the core story is interesting.  The action sequences and great camera work make this a movie worth watching.  Good acting and a strong finish help to overcome some loose ends and production errors.

The President of the United States (William Hurt), or POTUS as referred to by the secret service, is the target of a group of terrorists whose objectives are never revealed to us.  While overseas to attend an anti-terrorism summit in Spain, he is shot.  Or is he?

Dennis Quaid and Mathew Fox (of ""Lost"" fame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete First Season</a>) play secret service agents there to protect the President.  After multiple attacks occur after the president is shot, they scramble to try to respond and find the shooter.  It is very difficult to tell which attacks are meant to kill and which are meant to divert attention away from the villains.

Quaid takes advantage of Forest Whitaker's camcorder film and the media's tapes to piece together the story.  As each of the characters is swung into action, we get to see their individual struggles to cope with chaos and how their stories are interconnected.

Perhaps in an homage to ""24,"" after each character's scene finishes it 'rewinds' to the beginning to give us the next character's 'vantage point.' This gets old fast.  After a while, these vantage points seem to disintegrate into one another and overlap more and more.  In fact, this is one story where the effect seems to have taken away from the story.

The action sequences are very strong, and even though there's a lot of hand held camera work they get enough steady shots to make the chase scenes watchable.  Most notable is a car chase scene that is bound to draw comparisons to Ronin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin/dp/6305263248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin</a>, The Bourne Identity&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity-Widescreen-Extended-Edition/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>, The Italian Job&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Italian-Job-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000B1OFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and other recent car chase movies.  Putting together a sequence like that is very difficult, and I can't wait for the DVD to see how they did it.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good car chase.

The pacing of the movie is good and especially improves once we get to the last few vantage points.  The score is excellent and blends well with the action sequences.  We are purposely left without reasons why this group is after the president.

There are some technical things that are off in the movie.  Anybody who has ever been to Spain will get that uneasy feeling.  Once you see the Mexican extras and hear them speak a very Central American Spanish it becomes clear they are in Mexico, not Spain.  They try to use a few Spanish actors, but it's not enough to feel like Spain.

Some parts of the dialogue seem overly preachy.  Still, this movie does effectively portray how difficult security planning is in a world where government security tactics are public knowledge.  The story probably would have been more profound and meaningful with a traditional plot-line, which it turns into at the end anyway.

This movie is worth watching and improves a lot towards the end.  You just have to get past several very annoying rewind sequences and plenty of early repetition.

By the film's end I was waiting for our shaky-handed, Secret Service hero to rip-off his shirt to expose a big Superman letter ""S"" on his chest! Terrorists who blithely slaughter innocent people left and right will throw everything out the window over a  single child! You know a bomb has just been planted but you keep standing around talking. A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last. Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and kloncks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly!  But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!

 I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from  different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling. Too bad it was wasted on such a unbelievably ridiculous story! It's as if Hollywood's main concern is satisfying it's teenage market segment over all others. I'm not a teenager and I go to the movies virtually every week! What about the adult segment of your market? Don't we count for anything?

It tells the story of a terrorist attack in Salamanca, Spain, where the president is about to give a speech announcing a major new anti-terror initiative.  He is shot and the historic square where he was standing is subjected to a huge bomb blast as well.

I feel okay telling you this, because that's all revealed in the first few minutes of the movie. We see it all play out through the eyes of the TV journalists who are covering the event.  Because we haven't seen all the details of the attack before, we can enjoy a little thrill of the unexpected and the blood certainly gets racing during these opening scenes.  Then, the film goes back about 20 minutes to show the same events from the point of view of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), just returning to active duty a year after taking a bullet for the President.  Then it goes back AGAIN and shows everything from various other points of view.  Each retelling has slightly different information, of course, and each goes a little past the other, so that we see a little more of the story unfold.

Frankly, though, this device gets a little tiresome (and evoked a few sniggers from the audience as we see it going back YET AGAIN to the beginning).  It seems to want to lend some sort of importance to the film, but truly, the same story could have been told in a more traditional manner and perhaps been even more exciting.  The first time we see the president take a bullet, it's pretty unnerving. The fifth time we see it...ho hum.

Eventually, the film moves forward towards a resolution, mostly involving Quaid discovering a major character is not who he/she appears and then chasing that person throughout the old Spanish city for a really long time in a really small car.  (Good thing it doesn't have airbags or he would have been out of the chase pretty early on!).

The chase is reminiscent of the one in BOURNE IDENTITY and the location in Salamanca looks a lot like many of the locales in BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  The whole film feels derivative.  Other than its time-hopping gimic...there isn't much plot.  In fact, when it's all over, I realised that the entire narrative probably covered less than 40 minutes of time.  Also, the conclusion relies too much on the coincidence of EVERYONE arriving at the same location at the same time.

There's a visceral, jumpy quality to much of the action, and there's no doubt the car chase is done well.  It has moments of excitement.  But there's is simply too little meat on the bones of this film for it have any hope of rising above the mediocre.

Quaid, William Hurt (as the President), Matthew Fox as Quaid's co-hort and other well known character actors are all quite okay.  Forest Whitaker, as a tourist with a knack for videotaping the exact right things, is lost in a poorly written, thankless role...and he does little to make it more tolerable.  Sigourney Weaver, as the TV producer, spends the whole movie in the remote broadcast truck, and you quickly realise that there is absolutely no reason for an actor of her stature to be in this film.  She is given nothing interesting to do...but I assume got a decent paycheck for perhaps a weeks worth of work.

The movie is a 90 minute diversion, and certainly it is technically skillful.  I just don't think it will linger in the memory for very long after you leave the theater.",1203724800,,3506,4.596463022508039

After shots are fired and bombs explode,killing virtually no one,the film then rewinds multiple times (and I do mean multiple times) showing the original scene from different ""vantage points"" (hence the title)
I saw this at a free screening and we were informed that this film had been held back for a year. Why? I don't know. I can say that I felt that the Barry Levy screenplay,( a teacher of 3rd and 9th graders,who had his script picked up by Columbia),was dreadful!!!Again, from my ""vantage point"" this film has been done many times before and with much better results and acting.

3328425,5,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie is unpredictable. I could not guess what was coming until the end.

It has a unique way of telling a story. The plot is unfolded in 4 or 5 different people's points of views.  First, you'll see the motorcade of the president of  the United States arrived at the scene. At about noon, he was shot. Then, a huge explosion occurred at the scene that killed a lot of people. Next, the film was rewinded to 23 minutes earlier. Then it was told in the eyes of a secret service agent, Dennis Quaid. This time the narration stopped about 15 minutes after the president was shot. It showed us what was happening after the explosion. Then the movie was turned back 23 minutes again. This time, it was told in another person point of view. Each time, it revealed a little more about the plot and action. To me, the filming and the technique are very effective. It's very suspenseful.  It keeps my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.

A few critics said the movie lost its momentum because when the climax was about to be reached, the movie was rewinded. Yes, the first time it was done, it irritated me a little but five minutes later I was completely satisfied. It was because more details of the plot were revealed in another person's point of view! Further, the picture moved at fast pace so the rewinding did not cause any boredom.

The special effects are impressive. Especially, the explosion at the Plaza looks very real. It has some twists too.

Somebody said the ending was far fetched. Yes, so are the endings of many other movies. That does not reduce their entertaining values because they are not documentaries.

If you want something different, very thrilling and exciting. This is the film for you. It's the best thriller of 2008, so far. I certainly will buy it when it's released on DVD.",1203724800,3,1826,4.52887537993921
3328426,4,B0012QCZ5O,"As the Bourne series raises the bar for action films, and audiences balk at two-plus hour runtimes, the filmmakers of Vantage Point seem like they are trying to bring a fresh, new, unconventional take on the action/thriller genre. Though it may annoy some people, I felt the new take turns Vantage Point into a taut terrorist thriller.

The new take or approach is jumping right into the moment (everything is already planned out, people and weapons in place, etc.) of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view. This is where some people may be mildly irritated because after you see one point of view everything is suddenly rewound and shown from the next person's point of view (this is done six times) before they all converge into a thrilling finale filled with one massive adrenaline-fuelled car/chase sequence.

Because of the complex twists and turns of the plot and characters I will be brief, very brief actually, on the plot. It starts with a TV network covering a large gathering of leaders from all over the world (including the President of the United States) who have come together to form an alliance against the war on terror. At the beginning of this meeting the US president is assassinated as he takes the stage, and it begins replaying the assassination through all the different points of view. The editing must be commended in this film as it blends all the points of views so sophisticatedly you cannot help being engrossed, and the star-studded cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver simply adds to everything.

In the theater I was watching some people called out their annoyance of ""again?!"" on the fifth rewind, which I find amusing as the filmmakers are simply trying to come up with something new  in these sequel-ridden times. And probably as those same people say Hollywood is ""out of ideas"" they get angry when it tries something ""different"" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.

I felt Vantage Point was an intelligent thriller, and yes it had its' share of implausible plot points, but these were minor as the new technique makes you feel like you have an all-seeing surveillance system. I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.",1203638400,3,2413,4.749403341288783
3328427,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I never once believed that the events of ""Vantage Point"" were possible, but the clever structure and interweaving narratives made for one hell of a fun movie. This is a story that constructs itself out of multiple viewpoints, with characters that witness and/or participate in terrorist activity. To show these viewpoints, the film consistently rewinds itself and then replays, each time focusing on different characters while gradually revealing pieces of the puzzle. I agree that this isn't very realistic, but that doesn't matter since it's more about entertainment. It's a good thing I caught on to that early on, because at a certain point, the convenient twists and implausible action sequences become too numerous to count. The ad campaign claims that eight strangers bear witness, but it's actually hard to know for sure since the segments are very intermingled. You shouldn't be counting, anyway--you'll miss out on everything.

The film takes place in Spain in the city of Salamanca, where the President of the United States plans to take part in an anti-terror summit. A public statement will be given at the Plaza Mayor, where thousands of people have gathered both in support and in protest. Capturing the action for American television is camera director Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver), who demands the best footage from both crew and the reporters. Everything goes smoothly until the arrival of the President, who's immediately shot. Complete chaos ensues, which only gets worse with the sound of a distant explosion. It all comes to a grinding halt when the Plaza Mayor explodes in a gigantic fireball, killing dozens if not hundreds.

At this point, the story rewinds twenty-three minutes earlier, just as it turns noon. We now focus on Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid), a member of the President's Secret Service. Because he took a bullet for the President a year earlier, he's completely unsure of himself, so much so that he relies on an anti-anxiety medication to stay under control. The other guards seem to be just as unsure, especially since he overreacts to people who reach for things in their pockets. His partner, Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox), seems to be the only one that still respects him. As they stand on the stage, Barnes notices a fluttering curtain in a building that was supposed to be cleared. Even after it turns out to be nothing, he's clearly troubled by what he's seen. He then kicks into high gear when the shot is fired; after tackling and losing a man claiming to be a Spanish police officer, and after the explosion, Barnes runs into Brooks' news van and demands to see every moment of footage. He ends up seeing something that shocks him to the core.

The story rewinds again, and this time we focus on Enrique (Eduardo Noriega), a Spanish cop assigned to protect the Mayor of Salamanca. He's also set to meet his lover, Veronica (Ayelet Zurer), although he feels threatened when he sees another man holding her. This is bad because he already feels strange about what Veronica wants him to do. After a quick exchange, Enrique moves into the crowd and witnesses the President being shot. He runs on stage, only to be tackled by Barnes and arrested on the spot. After the explosion, Enrique leads the Secret Service on a chase through the streets, one that ends at an underpass spanning a busy highway. It also ends with him saying ""Surprised to see me alive?"" to an as yet unrevealed person.

Once again, the story rewinds. We now meet Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker), an American tourist visiting Europe for the first time. Capturing every moment on a digital camcorder, he walks around Plaza Mayor with awe in his eyes. As the summit gets underway, he notices an odd interaction with a Spanish couple, the kind that says they have something to hide from the rest of the world. He then notices strange activity in the upper floors of a building, which then leads to the President being shot. As panic takes hold, Barnes approaches Lewis and demands to see the footage he shot. Then comes the explosion, which both Lewis and his camera miraculously survive. Even more miraculous is his willingness to chase Enrique and continue recording the events--he seems awfully curious for someone who barely escaped with his life.

I can't describe the remaining viewpoints simply because too much would be given away. I'm sorry to say that one of the biggest plot points was already given away in the trailers, and it relates directly to the President (William Hurt). To those of you who have seen them: you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who haven't seen them: believe me, you're better off. Be that as it may, I was greatly entertained by this film, from its enticing start to its frenetic finish. The final ten minutes of ""Vantage Point"" are fast-paced and satisfying, and they feature a lengthy car chase that's anything but realistic, a subplot about a man's missing brother, and more than a few characters running across busy streets. Best of all, it features that climactic moment when all the major viewpoints converge into a single narrative. I can't say that the story is unpredictable--that would depend on your ability to detect elaborate plot twists. What I can say is that, even if you do figure everything out too soon, you'll probably still have fun watching it.",1203638400,3,5333,4.875413450937155
3328428,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point was the film I chose to see this weekend at my local theater and I went in with high hopes. The storyline, which is a part-interlocking , part-flashback film (which, for the record, are my two favourite film elements combined into one!) is simple, yet complex to uncover. The film opens at a UN gathering of world leaders in Spain, with a big crowd, in an even bigger square. Suddenly the president of the United States is shot twice by an unseen assassin. The next thing you know, two bombs go off, one of them destroying the square.

The film is made up of that story told five times--each from a different point of view from a different person who was there. First, we've got agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who is back on assignment after taking a bullet for the president six months prior. He's paranoid, and picks up on any slight signal that could mean an assassination threat. Next, there's a shady looking cop who commits a strange act at the scene--is he corrupt? You decide. Third, we've got the American tourist (Forest Whitaker) who loves videotaping things. Fourth, we have the president himself, and fifth--we see the assassination unfold before our eyes. In addition to these four main characters, there are four others who are involved in the scenes, and combined, makes for a total of eight people searching for the truth--or who are somehow involved in it.

Each ""vantage point"" (hence the film's righteous name) offers more and more clues as to which of these people were involved in the assassination. Director Pete Travis delivers a bang-up job in making the plot line completely and utterly unpredictable. Even most people who can guess plot twists coming at any speed will be left baffled and thinking hard. My favourite aspect of the film was that it was entirely the same thing on repeat--yet different every time. There were some stupid idiots in my theater that were booing every time the scene got restarted, and that's where I think a lot of people will dislike this film, because it is undoubtedly repetitive. However, I feel the redundancy of the film adds to its original essence and its tension. The tension in the film is done very well and the first quarter of the film will have you holding on to your seat. Although there's a more than action packed climax, people who just want to see stuff blown up and people shot and car chases will be left disappointed throughout the movie. Don't worry--even throughout the redundancy there's plenty of that good stuff. My other favourite aspect of the film was its acting--Dennis Quaid was excellent and Forest Whitaker blew me away like he always does, in a role perfectly cast for him. Sigourney Weaver's brief cameos were done very well and everyone in the cast does a great job.

All that being said, Vantage Point is definitely not without its flaws. Some of the characters aren't introduced right and the execution in many scenes is done very sloppily. The climax (although ironically long) is extremely rushed and, in my opinion, was done rather poorly. Unfortunately I can't elaborate without giving away major spoilers, but it is a fun ending to watch nevertheless, and you are able to forgive the sloppy editing. The thing that made me want to cry was the horribly clichd conclusion that shouldn't have happened. In my opinion...they should've revised the screenplay. I hope there's an alternate ending on the DVD.

So, if you're looking for a decent thriller or a movie to check out, you might just want to see Vantage Point. The classic assassination thriller, a splash of originality, garnished with great acting and an unneeded sloppy ending turns out to be one bittersweet cocktail. But mostly just sweet.",1203638400,2,3715,4.809076682316119
3328429,3,B0012QCZ5O,"President Ashton (William Hurt) is scheduled to make an appearance in Spain, with a number of other world leaders, to show their support of a recent Anti-Terrorism bill they have all worked on. The Secret Service is out in force to protect POTUS (The President of the United States) from the massive crowds that have assembled. One of those agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) is back on the job after a lengthy recovery after taking a bullet for the President a year ago. As this is his first assignment back, he is, naturally, a little shell shocked. His partner, Taylor (Matthew Fox) is confident the veteran can handle the action. An American tourist, Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) stumbles upon the ceremony, and, eager to share the memories with the folks at home, videotapes everything. A Spanish Policeman, Javier (Edgar Ramirez) tries to reconcile with his girlfriend, but she is cold to him, and only wants the bag she asked him to bring. Dejected, he begins to put two and two together and rushes to the stage as... The GNN is also on hand, to cover the press conference and the harried director, Rex (Sigourney Weaver) is shocked when her cameras capture the assassination of the President. But Barnes begins to suspect there is more going on and is determined to find out the truth.

""Vantage Point"", the new film directed by Pete Travis (who comes from British Television) and written by Barry Levy, uses an interesting narrative device to frame an overworked story. But they don't seem to fully embrace the idea and the results are a mixed bag.

""Vantage"" sets up its narrative device very quickly, and efficiently, giving us a jam packed opening segment. Basically, Rex and her team are covering the President's speech. As his arrival is imminent, Rex is trying to coordinate all of the different cameras, her liberal reporter (Zoe Saldana) and the network in New York. As soon as the President arrives, Rex is confident she has worked out the kinks, but she is shocked, as is everyone else, when the President is captured on camera receiving two bullets. Shortly thereafter, Barnes bursts into her control room and wants to see video. When he scans through the video, something catches his eye. Then, the film literally rewinds, showing us a few key images, presumably clues to what is going on, and a clock shows us we have rewound the last twenty minutes to just before Noon. Now, we see the same events, but through Barnes' eyes, seeing the different things he sees, learning different information.

As the story unfolds again, we move a little further in the narrative before the film rewinds and we are back to Noon. This time, we are watching the same events unfold through President Ashton's eyes. Then, we rewind again and watch the events through Javier's eyes. This happens a number of times, each story showing us slightly different information, ending slightly later, giving us a larger view of the same picture. As we watch the events unfold again and again, we learn more and more and realize maybe Barnes is right.

The audience at the screening I attended seemed to get a little annoyed by the rewinding narrative. Ever heard of Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" folks? ""Vantage Point"" isn't as good as Kurosawa's masterpiece, but it is an interesting technique to use in this day and age. It also keeps the film moving at a fast clip. As each of these segments runs about fifteen minutes, all of the various story elements within are presented at hyper speed, to make sure we always arrive at the same point. This isn't to say they feel forced, they just move, and this makes the film seem fast paced. So, for these reasons, I appreciated the narrative device.

But towards the end of the film, when Barnes is chasing the bad people through the streets of Salamanca, it occurred to me that we missed a couple of vantage points. These segments allow each of the characters to become established in our eyes, as the segments present their point of view of the proceedings. The characters who are given full segments are more interesting and viable, even if they are a bit formulaic. One segment is devoted to three or four people, all of whom are behind the plot, only showing us their actions in the plot. This is problematic because we never learn, beyond some overused jingoistic slogans, why these people are interested in assassinating our President.

 There is a `big surprise' towards the end of the film which is more or less telegraphed very early on. Anyone who has seen more than a few thrillers or similar suspense films will likely be able to figure this out much earlier than the filmmakers want you to. This is a bit of a let down because when they reveal this big surprise, you have already figured it out and it seems more commonplace than anything else.

Because each of the stars has basically one segment to call their own, they have to develop their character at a rapid pace. This shortened focus on their individual characters helps to make them seem more interesting than they are; many of them are little more than clichs, but since we only spend ten to fifteen minutes focusing on them, these problems aren't as apparent. Naturally, as these characters interact, they make `guest appearances' in each of the stories, and the filmmakers have smartly held back key moments, for instance, we don't see what Barnes sees in the videotape until much later in the film, of some of these characters until the attention shifts to their character or until the film is about the come to a close, building the suspense nicely.

Quaid, one of the most underrated actors working today, fares well. His back story is established during the first segment, concentrating on the GNN coverage of the event. Rex catches a glimpse of him in one of the cameras and commands one of her editors to pull up the story, rehashing Barnes previous attempts at thwarting an assassin's bullet. So, when the attention shifts to Barnes, all we need to see is his shaky hand to know he is feeling a little trepidation about his return to duty. Because he is nervous, he naturally sees assassins every where.

William Hurt also does a very good job as President Ashton. Ashton seems more self-aware, more conscious of his image and his actions on the rest of the world than we are perhaps used to. This is why he is so determined to see this agreement he has forged, an agreement to fight terrorism, become a reality. When he is presented with a plan to retaliate against the people suspected of the attack, he downplays the need to act immediately, aware that this is what they want and also aware of the consequences of attacking a friendly country. As he enters the ceremony, among signs labeling him a murderer and a terrorist, he also seems to disregard these as the necessary evils of his job.

Sigourney Weaver's role as Rex, the director of the news network feed, is a bit short, and reactionary. She has a brief fight with her reporter (Saldana) and then simply reacts to the rest of the events. The person I saw this film with wondered if part of her role had been edited, left on the cutting room floor, because it seems unnaturally abrupt.

Forest Whitaker plays the American tourist, Howard Lewis, traveling through Europe for the first time. We learn he and his wife are taking a break, to clear their heads, so Howard decides to travel and assiduously videotape everything he sees. Howard isn't a bad character, he is interesting, but his purpose is just too treacly to do the film any good. A Spanish girl, walking with her mom, accidently bumps into Howard, dropping her ice cream. Howard is apologetic, he has kids of his own, kids he misses dearly, and offers to buy her a replacement cone. Her mother declines. No, I'm not kidding, this is actually what happens to his character. Later, they are brought together in a moment that is just too farfetched to believe.

Matthew Fox is good, but he seems designed to give Barnes the requisite encouragement he needs to get past his demons. As such, his character isn't exactly well-formed.

""Vantage Point"" has problems, but it also has some benefits. It benefits from a fast-pace, interesting narrative device and some good work by well-respected character actors. These benefits almost outweigh the problems in the film. Almost.",1203552000,3,8301,4.751561415683553

3328445,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point is one of these all-action thrillers which, when well executed, will keep you on your tip toes, enthralled until the very last minute, and unaware of a number of plot weaknesses.

The trick used to achieve this is to have the same story  a terrorist attack and assassination attempt against the President of the United States during his speech in Salamanca (Spain)  seen through the eyes of eight different witnesses and participants of the events including the President himself, with each of them adding something different to the story, something that others were not part of, did not see or did not realise the significance of what they were seeing.

The device is a particularly powerful one that does a lot to keep up the suspense and also makes you miss imperfections, weaknesses or implausible elements of the scenario. For instance, you are never quite told about whom the attackers really are and why they are carrying out such an attack. More importantly, this feature and the storys fast pace simply does not leave you enough time to realise just how implausible some of the scenes happen to be.

Perhaps the most extreme example of implausibility is that of a rogue member of the Spanish Special Forces who, single handed, overpowers and shoots to pieces the whole of the US Presidents highly trained and professional security detail from the Secret Service. He gets away with it with barely a scratch - I am slightly exaggerating here because he does end up wounded, but not critically - despite the fact that his multiple opponents are just as well trained as he happens to be.

Then there are the actors performances. Some of them are quite remarkable; such as Sigourney Weaver as the TV senior journalist of some CNN-equivalent Team sent out to cover the event and which is on the scene when the President gets shoot at and everyone blows up, both figuratively and literally. Forest Whitaker is also excellent, and perhaps the best performer of all when playing the role of a totally innocent US tourist who happened to be in town, came to see and hear his Presidents speech. He gets caught up in the events but completely misses  as the vast majority of the participants - a large part of what is really going on. The characters played by Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are perhaps more conventional and you might in fact be tempted to make some comparisons with two somewhat similar characters (Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland) playing in the Sentinel while Said Taghmaoui makes up a suitable  although not very original or subtle nasty.

3328599,1,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point, 2008 film

The US President is addressing an audience at a plaza in Spain. There are shots, the President is hit! There is confusion among the crowd. Then a bomb explodes! The Chief Secret Service agent say a flash from a window as it happened. A Spanish bodyguard is arrested; what does he know? There is a chase through crowded streets, the man gets away. [Scenes are repeated to pad out the story. What did you see?] Was this recorded on a video phone? The photographer joins the chase after that bodyguard. That young girl is rescued. [This adds drama to the story.]

We learn about the use of a double. There is a rogue agent involved! Terrorists are seeking revenge for an earlier attack. The President is tired of hiding. There is a car chase on the streets and sidewalks of this city. Then a crash! Wheres my brother? Where is POTUS? That ambulance has an accident and overturns. Ive got you. Thomas Barnes calls for help. The police arrive to secure the scene. President Ashton has survived! The assassins were eliminated. You wonder who was behind this.

This could have been a better movie with a better script. Those numerous repetitive scenes only pad out the story. Watch The Parallax View for the best example of a story about intrigue and suspense based on historical events. The US Secret Service began Presidential Protection after McKinley was shot, since then no President was ever lost to an assassins pistol.",1430956800,,1445,4.726190476190476

3328628,4,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT

 Whee!  Vantage Point is an A ticket thrill ride.  Secret Service hero agent Dennis Quad gets in the middle of an attempt on the life of the President of the USA at a summit on terrorism in Spain.  There is a car chase in this one that sets new levels of mayhem, Steve McQueen eat your heart out.  There is quick cut film editing for the chase that gives it a larger than life immediacy and a high level of anxiety.  It is a real knuckle biter.
 The ad copy for the movie compares itself to the classic Japanese flick, Rashomon.  The comparison is not, unfortunately, because both movies were or will be Oscar winners.  The comparison is because the film covers the assassination attempt from several points of view, hence the title.  This is an interesting and effective technique that is taken about one view point too long.  While it lasts, the multiple view points keep us guessing as to just what is going on, beyond the obvious crime.
 Forest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver have supporting roles, and the estimable William Hurt is the president, but frankly the acting is almost a side issue.  Granted, it is fun to see experts working, but the real pleasure here is to try to keep up with the fast moving action as best we can.
 The movie has made back its backers money in only ten days.  They will be as happy as the viewers are that they put this one on film.  It runs a fast and furious one and a half hours.  The movie is rated as PG13 for the general murder and terrorism.  No nakey people.  BTW this is the first major film lately that has Islamic terrorists rather than Russians or Nazis or even the American government.  Three fun filled saw blades for Vantage Point.",1425772800,,1697,4.427184466019417

However, whoever the idiot was who designed the presentation (as versus, a very good plot) should be forever banned from any association with the entertainment industry  other than, perhaps, running a concession stand.

What tries the patience an eventually ruins the flick, is the interminable and pointless flashbacks, needlessly and repeatedly covering the opening sequences  I eventually started counting how many times theyd go over the same scenes from varying points of view, but finally they tried my patience once too many and I just yelled at the player, I get it and switched it off.

First of all it has an excellent ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Forrest Whittaker, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana in a supporting role. This movie is action packed, fast paced and somewhat of a thriller.

Forrest Whitaker""s character is an American tourist in Europe. While he's in Europe he attends and videotapes a speech that the President of the United States has in Europe. During the President's speech a bombing occurs and an assassination attempt on the President. Dennis Quaid's character is a member of the secret service. Dennis Quaid's character becomes involved the investigation of the assassination plot and attempts to save the president. Forest Whitaker's character becomes involved when his videotape is needed for the investigation.

Vantage Point has an interesting way of introducing different sequences of events necessary to understand and follow the plot of the film. As a rule I don't usually like it when segments of a film are shown with different timelines involved. Vantage Point however manages to do this with out making the film seem choppy or annoying.

When President Ashton is shot moments after his arrival in Spain, chaos ensues and disparate lives collide in the hunt for the assassin. In the crowd is Howard Lewis, an American tourist who thinks he's captured the shooter on his camcorder while videotaping the event for his kids back home. Also there is American TV news producer Rex Brooks, relaying the historic event to millions of TV viewers across the globe. As they and others reveal their stories, the pieces of the puzzle will fall into place - and it will become apparent that shocking motivations lurk just beneath the surface. The cast led by Dennis Quaid (as Thomas Barnes), Matthew Fox (as Kent Taylor), Forest Whitaker (as Howard Lewis), Sigourney Weaver (as Rex Brooks), and William Hurt (as President Ashton) is excellent. The directing by Pete Travis is great. The story and screenplay by Barry L. Levy is great. The music by Atli rvarsson (who also did the music to the upcoming ""Babylon A.D."" (2008) is excellent. The cinematography by Amir Mokri (who also did the cinematography to ""National Treasure: Book Of Secrets"" (2007) is excellent. The film editing by Stuart Baird (who also did the film editing to ""Casino Royale"" (2006) is excellent. The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (both who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Iron Man"" (2008) is excellent. The production design by Brigitte Broch (who also did the production design to ""Babel"" (2006) is excellent. The art direction by Marcelo Del Rio (who also did the art direction to ""The Matador"" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Denise Camargo (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" (2008) is excellent. The costume design by Luca Mosca (who also did the costume design to ""Step Up 2 The Streets"" (2008) & the upcoming ""21"" (2008) is great.

A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last. Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and clonks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly! But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!

I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling. Too bad it was wasted on such a unbelievably ridiculous story! It's as if Hollywood's main concern is satisfying it's teenage market segment over all others. I'm not a teenager and I go to the movies virtually every week! What about the adult segment of your market? Don't we count for anything?

This film is trying terribly hard to be a frantic 'French Connection' type movie without worrying much about the story. If all you want is dumbed-down, murder and mayhem, a sort of terrorist war-porn flick, then Vantage Point is for you!

What follows though is a cleverly done, ""everything is not what it seems,"" saga that takes you through the different perspectives of each character before launching forward into unknown events, culminating in a grand finale that does not disappoint.
Even though the movie jumps backwards and forwards, it is well executed and it does keep you on the edge of your seat!

3328740,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I considered titling the review ""Rashamush,"" since so many are eager to compare ""Vantage Point"" to that classic. But it's not even close. For starters, the characters may as well be made of cardboard. if you haven't figured out the bulk of ""Vantage Point"" within the first 30 minutes or better, you haven't watched enough political thrillers lately. Even with the predictability aside, there are bits here that are all but unfathomable.

For instance, the American Tourist, as played by Forrest Whittaker. His camocrder captures the assassination/terrorist attack, but he's a bit of a - to be kind - portly guy. Before you know it, he's racing down the street, videoing with the product placement - sorry, the Sony - minicam while keeping up with two secret service agents who are chasing a very in-shape potential suspect. The man he's supposed to be would have been out of breath after a couple blocks, but not this guy. He's the energizer bunny with a videotape.

The terrorists are willing to blast away any 'loose ends,' suicide bomb a hotel, blow up an entire crowd, but suddenly get concerned over a little girl? Huh? Oh yes, and these bloodthirsty, multicultural warriors (after all, the terrorists can't possibly be racially profiled) who kidnap a high ranking government official do so and race off WITHOUT RESTRAINING THE HOSTAGE. So guess what said captive manages to do soon after? And no, the answer isn't negotiate a peaceable settlement.

Then there's the car chase. It's so impossibly choreographed as to be laughable. Yet Secret Service Agents Matthew Fox and Dennis Quiad manage to duck and weave their way through itty bitty streets and one-ways in reverse that you start wondering if Fox was trying to outmaneuver the rapid decline of his acting career. Add one ""America isn't like THAT"" Presidential sermon, a sappy resolution for Forrest, and the fact that the terrorists seem to have no agenda (how PC is that?), ""Vantage Point"" becomes a movie that wastes its talent (poor Sigourney Weaver as a b---chy producer in particular) that whatever POV it thought it had becomes more of a vanishing point.",1334707200,2,2122,4.955056179775281

The movie had to do with the President of the US speaking at a conference in Spain and an attempt to end his life. Well, the conspirators succeeded in killing a stand-in double. In any case, this murder was viewed from eight ""Vantage Points"" so you ended up seeing the same thing over and over but from different perspectives. It was an interesting idea but became tedious and failed as a movie.

Watching the same thing over and over eight times was deadening, even if it was from eight different perspectives. The idea might have worked on a smaller scale, but the cast of the movie numbered in the multi-thousands and it just resembled total chaos, as it would in real life. A major task was just  remembering who the major characters were and what they had to do with the main plot. The acting was marginal. Then it got down to a long and meaningless auto chase scene (well done, I might add) and the whole thing became largely incomprehensible, at least for me. The director and his crew probably understood it perfectly, but the movie isn't made for the director. In any case, the movie represents an interesting innovation, but it failed as a movie.

3328746,2,B0012QCZ5O,"While the overall premise of the film is interesting, this movie was not executed in an interesting way.
Vantage Point shows us a terrorist attack on the President of the United States from several different characters' point of view.
The idea of this movie was to take a scene and show it from several different perspectives that would slowly reveal to us who was behind the attack. That would be interesting, except for the fact that there were too many different points of view, and not enough interesting moments happening between them. Each viewpoint is started with a few-second countdown to 12:00 P.M.. After three times, I groaned when this scene would pop up again. After three viewpoints, you just want to know who did it and you really, really don't want to see the attack again. Of all the characters in the film, only four of them are interesting enough to follow. The others just add monotony to the film. Cut their scenes out and it would have been a much smoother and exciting ride. No offense to anyone, but I would definitely cut out the little Hispanic girl from the film. She was so annoying! And when she ran out into traffic and just screamed for five minutes while the ambulance slowly came at her... just ticked me off.

**Spoiler Alert**
Yes, I know that without her jetting out in front of the ambulance the bad guys would have likely escaped, but it was still annoying to have to watch.
**End Spoiler Alert**

Another disappointment of the film for me was the Control Room scene with Sigourney Weaver. If you are the director of a live broadcast involving several world leaders, you would not be as relaxed and motionless as the people in that Control Room were in that scene. Weaver would be constantly talking to cameramen, yelling orders to crew members, watching each TV screen for better camera angles, and she would certainly NOT have time to take a phone call during the show! Someone did not do their research.
Sorry, I'll step down from my soap box. Overall, the film had some interesting plot twists and exciting moments, but it was too redundant to be an enjoyable watch.

As far as questionable content:
Since the film deals with terrorists, there are some disturbing images, violence and profanity throughout.

3328747,5,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie is unpredictable. I could not guess what was coming until the end.

It has a unique way of telling a story. The plot is unfolded in 4 or 5 different people's points of views. First, you'll see the motorcade of the president of the United States arrived at the scene. At about noon, he was shot. Then, a huge explosion occurred at the scene that killed a lot of people. Next, the film was rewinded to 23 minutes earlier. Then it was told in the eyes of a secret service agent, Dennis Quaid. This time the narration stopped about 15 minutes after the president was shot. It showed us what was happening after the explosion. Then the movie was turned back 23 minutes again. This time, it was told in another person point of view. Each time, it revealed a little more about the plot and action. To me, the filming and the technique are very effective. It's very suspenseful. It keeps my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning till the end.

A few critics said the movie lost its momentum because when the climax was about to be reached, the movie was rewinded. Yes, the first time it was done, it irritated me a little but five minutes later I was completely satisfied. It was because more details of the plot were revealed in another person's point of view! Further, the picture moved at fast pace so the rewinding did not cause any boredom.

The special effects are impressive. Especially, the explosion at the Plaza looks very real. It has some twists too.

Somebody said the ending was far fetched. Yes, so are the endings of many other movies. That does not reduce their entertaining values because they are not documentaries.

Unfortunately, the movie ends up a jumbled, incohesive mess.  There are so many stories and characters that alot of major questions never get answered.  He would have been much better off eliminating the pointless character of the voyeur, played by Forrest Whitaker.  He plays a very creepy guy (like raincoat flasher creepy).  The movie would have been much better and less confusing if they had edited out his character and the entire story line, and instead focused upon the conspiracy itself and the perpetrators.

I couldn't quite figure out what was going on in the beginning, it was fairly vague...something to do with the president, a Spanish leader, and maybe the Pope? I didn't know for sure. This was actually okay, because I got to see it over again in a few minutes from another perspective. And another. And another. And another. You basically see the first ten minutes of the movie about four or five times over, like a crash course in redundancy.

Thankfully, the movie stops chasing its own tail and progresses forward to show us who the nameless faceless characters are, and who is really in on the 'deal'.

Except, nobody really tells you what the 'deal' is. By the end of the movie you are left scratching your head to what this whole movie was actually about. It's a false execution, a snatching of the president, some dumbfounded SS agents, and a bunch of Spanish activists that are on some violent mission of some sort to prove something. And while all of this is happening, I'm expecting some grand unveiling of what it's all about - and it never happens. Just a mess of confusion and people shooting at each other. The movie falsely climaxes at the end with a few dead people, no real resolution, and little explanation of anything. Characters are mentioned but never shown or talked about (such as the 'brother' that dolt is shouting about towards the end), and this 'Mayor' that apparently is so important to the guy who is running from SS for half of the movie (I couldn't tell if he was actually a good guy or a bad guy). And nevermind the camcorder footage - it really doesn't mean anything at all, as it turns out.

Now, about the acting...

Dennis Quaid over-acts as usual, trying to strike fear with his dramatic tone of voice and inability to handle stressful situations. (he's one of the most agitating actors to me, but that's another story)

Forest Whittaker must have had the easiest job in the world for this film - a philanthropic soul with a video camera on vacation in Spain, taking in the sights and sounds...meeting a little girl and spilling her ice cream, then miraculously saving her life after all of the bad stuff goes down... honestly they could have used anyone that's starred in a B-movie for this role.

Sigourney Weaver is almost absent, her largest role being the first ten minutes directing TV anchors to get the best shot. Really, someone send an alien down to make this movie more interesting. The other people I don't even remember, that's how memorable they were.

Ultimately, ""Vantage Point"" is a fail. A vague plot line, no real direction, and a repetitive, yawn-inducing first half of the movie.

3328763,4,B0012QCZ5O,"During a rainy July fourth, I watched Vantage Point. Starring Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox as Secret Service agents, Sigourney Weaver as a cable news director, and Forrest Witaker as a tourist with a video camera, Vantage Point gives you a look at the same fifteen minutes of an event from multiple, you guessed it, vantage points.

The President of the United States has gathered with many of the world's leaders in Spain to initiate a new task force to battle terrorism. As he steps up to the podium, with arms outstretched, a sniper shoots him. The place goes into chaos with people running around, screaming; and then the bomb goes off.

Dennis Quaid is the seasoned agent who had taken a bullet for the President earlier in his term and is just now returning to active duty because his partner (Fox) believes in him. He does a great job with that sour face of his. I think in almost every movie he's in, he wears that scowl. That could be because his smile is very goofy.

Matthew Fox comes across as your typical American hero. I haven't seen Speed Racer or We Are Marshall, but this man will have a future in films.

Sigourney Weaver starts the movie off, but you really don't see much of her. I guess that's alright. We see her point of view first and then that's it.

There are twists as you would expect in this film. It is a good action-thriller. The run time is only one hour and thirty minutes so it's a very quick movie.

3328764,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I recently, finally got to see this movie and really liked it.
Lets get the small issues that others have mentioned out of the way.
Yes, the car chase was a bit over-the-top and ""Hollywood"" but if you paid attention to the character that was driving (Quaid), this is the guy that is supposed to be one of the best at what he does.
Zoe Saldana's character (Reporter) that makes crass comments about her own country in her report may have made people say, ""She can't do that!"" but that is exactly what that character was doing. She made you NOT like her. So, lets give credit to the acting here and not the fact that it was a character we all wanted to punch in the face.
The multiple cuts from one person's short story or ""vantage point"" was a nice way to tell this story. There is a LOT of foreshadowing in this movie. That's how they told the story. Showing you a little here and little there and you have to piece it together yourself.
Example: Forest Whittaker is a tourist filming the event and is politely speaking and greeting the people on balconies. He notices right before the terrorist event that all the people on the balconies have gone inside and closed the windows. You can see in his face that he knew, something was about to happen.
Sigourney Weaver's character being a strong woman, in charge of the television action as the event happens may not have been a big acting stretch for her, cuz we've seen her do this before but as her coworkers plead, ""cut the feed"" you can see in her face, she wants to keep it going but does the right thing. She cuts the feed but still records which helps Quaid later in the movie.
Well made, well written and although a little over-the-top, was worth 4 stars.
You don't have to watch this more than once but it is worth watching more than once to pick up on more foreshadowing and it sort of makes a game out of watching it.",1294012800,,1876,4.332386363636363

The concept of the movie was interesting, I'll give it that much.  Terrorists (or possibly security forces, or maybe Spanish police...I never did figure that part out) try to kill the President.  (Or maybe not. That part wasn't clear either.) There is a news crew that records the event, a clueless tourist with a camera, a secret service guy with personal problems, and loads of indistinguishable bad guys.  The story, such as it was, is told and retold, going back over the same 25 minutes, from all those different points of view. (Except for the news crew, which somehow gets left out of the plot.) As a story-telling device this could have been quite effective, except you actually need a story to pull it off.

There wasn't one. Nobody EVER explains who the guys were who were trying to kill and/or kidnap the President. (Why kidnap the President anyhow? Can you hold the President for ransom?)

Isn't there some point where the camera man must put the camera down and help out? This would have been a great movie had they simply did the thing with a plot and subplot in a chronological sequence, focusing on the character of the secret service agent,  rather than play ""Groundhog's Day"" with it.

I thought the constant rewinding--and replaying--of the same hectic scene (an assassination attempt on the President who is abroad in Espanol) was terrifically invigorating; different perspectives make for different realities (what appears as major to one character turns out to be inconsequential to another).

The action is tight, the pacing adrenaline-fast, and the suspense and intrigue aromatically heady, as a group of terrorists perp a complicated plot involving murder and mayhem (for reasons known only to themselves, certainly not to the viewer).  It's as over the top as elephants flying to the moon on gossamer wings (for instance, access to the Prez is a snap), yet the titanic suspension of disbelief is half the fun.

The terror plot is all too plausible. Let's hope no one gets any ideas from this. Most of the actors are fine and the dialogue is ok. Only Forest Whitaker is a bit too hapless as the American tourist who accidentally films everything on his video cam.

By replaying the final 25 minutes leading up to these events, numerous times, the filmmakers piece together the various people involved from different vantage points. It's too bad director Pete Travis and company couldn't have told a more straightforward story instead of stooping to a gimmick like this. We're lucky it just lasts 90 minutes.

3328793,3,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" was directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The attempted assassination of the President of the United States is told from several different points of view until all the pieces come together. Members of the cast include Dennis Quaid, Forest Whitaker, Matthew Fox, William Hurt, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana, and Sigourney Weaver.

In this ensemble piece, the editing and pacing of the movie was very strong. The car chase scene was one of the better ones I've seen, it was very exciting and engaging. Some of the twists and turns in the plot were very predictable but others were pretty enjoyable. Part of the fun of watching this movie is trying to solve it before they come out and tell you what happened. It almost reminded me of the first few episodes of ""Lost"" where each character's perspective of where they were and what they were doing when the plane crashed ending with something suspenseful. Eventually it all converges on the same city block.

On the flip side of that, I think too many perspectives were used. Usually about three is a good number to go with in telling different versions of a story, beyond that it gets a little cluttered and unorganized. At the fourth time, I was like, ""Really? We're going back to 11:59am AGAIN?"" Despite all that, it only has a 90 minute running time because the back story on characters is very brief and given through conversations so it all mostly converges on the assassination attempt and aftermath.

Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana are very underutilized in this film. They show up in the beginning to show the newscasters' perspective of the events with Saldana as a reporter trying to throw her own commentary on the event along with the news and Weaver shutting her down as the editor. This leads into Quaid's back story of his Secret Service Agent career with Matthew Fox.

Forest Whitaker plays a tourist watching the whole slew of events through his camcorder and he veers between awestruck delight at his surroundings to distressed terror and determination for some reason to run down the bad guys and try to capture all the evidence he can with his camera. Granted, he does capture many relevant moments in footage, but the average tourist of his size risking his life is pretty surprising since he isn't an off-duty Jack Bauer or anything. William Hurt's performance as the President is very brief (like many performances in the film) and he mostly fiddles with paperwork and rides in cars.

Matthew Fox's performance was the most predictable with no surprises whatsoever. He plays the same stubborn guy he plays in ""Lost"" but as a Secret Service Agent instead of a surgeon. I would be so relieved if Jack on ""Lost"" somehow got offed in this last season. I could care less who Kate chooses, I think the biggest surprise would be if she chose Claire instead of Jack or Sawyer.

All in all, this is an exciting thriller with very short performances and maybe a few too many versions to the story, but edited together very well.",1270944000,,3016,4.7461832061068705
3328794,3,B0012QCZ5O,"When I heard about the premise of this film, I thought it sounded interesting and ambitious: the same exciting moment in time as seen from several different points of view.  The American president gets assasinated while preparing to give a speech in a public square in Spain.  The same half hour or so is seen through the eyes of a news producer (Sigourney Weaver) and her reporter, a Secret Service Agent (Dennis Quaid), an onlooker (Forrest Whitaker) in the crowd assembled to watch the speech, and several of the people involved in plotting to kill the president. Because of all the intense action and different points of view, we rarely see exactly the same thing, so the film isn't boring at all.  But there are several aspects of the movie that are very far-fetched.  (I can't say what without putting spoilers into the review, so please take my word on this)!  However the thing that really bothered me about this is that we spend half the movie watching the bad guys, and we never really understand any of their motivation for their actions.  For instance, after shooting the president, there are two explosions near his podium that really only harm the onlookers.  Even at the end of the movie, there's only one line that even attempts to explain the wherefores of all that we've just watched, so for me the film is really unsatisfying.  Its saving graces are the well done action sequences and the performances of Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whitaker, as well as one of the good guys who's been roped into being one of the assassins by the kidnapping of a family member - again, far fetched.

If you like action movies with very little heart, or you're a big fan of Dennis Quaid or Forrest Whitaker, buy the movie.  Otherwise, I can't really recommend it.

1.  The movie portrays the Secret Service as a bunch of poorly trained buffoons.  I know for a fact that this is nonsense.  These guys are highly trained specialists.  A lot of them are ex-military.  There is no way that one guy could take out over a dozen of them like portrayed in the film.  No way.
2.  The worlds dumbest kid stops dead in front of a speeding ambulance and the terrorist driver swerves out of the way to avoid killing her.  Since when do terrorists worry about killing kids?
3.  One of the terrorists has a cell phone with technology from the 31st century.  He can detonate bombs, activate machine guns, and shave in the morning with this thing.  The only thing missing from it was a transporter from Star Trek.
4.  If kidnapping the President of the United States was that easy, G.W. Bush would have been taken out 6 years ago.  Utter nonsense.
5.  The longest car chase since Gone in 60 Seconds, was just a boring waste of time.

In this we have Dennis Quaid as a Secret Service agent who witnesses the shooting & tries to piece together everything that has happened, much like Cage's cop does in ""Snake Eyes"" after a Senator is shot at a boxing match

We have a rogue Secret Service agent(Matthew Fox), just as Gary Sinise was a rogue cop in ""Snake Eyes"" that may or may not be involved

We have an unwilling, but determined witness(Forest Whittaker) who himself tries to put the pieces together, just Carla Gugino's character does in Cage's film

We have members of the President's staff with their own agendas as did the boxing promoters did in Cage's film

& like in Cage's film we have a mysterious man & woman who are involved but yet it never really becomes clear as to why they are involved or who they really work for

U.S. president Ashton (William Hurt) is in Salamanca, Spain to announce plans for a major global summit on terrorism. The U.S. President stands behind the podium in front of a shouting crowd in a large plaza.  Protesters are roped off on a side area.

The first scene of the assassination is the news center with television news Producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  We watch as she is surprised to see Secret Service Agent Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who recently took a bullet for the President - back on duty with darting eyes focusing on a second story window where a curtain moves.  The President is shot twice -  then we hear a small explosion and then a massive blast.  Rex's news anchor dies before her and the TV audience.  Somehow Agent Barnes gets to the news center and rewinds the film and sees a clue.  Then he runs off again.

Then the film rewinds over and over to just before noon on that fateful day.  It becomes tedious but you get a new clue with each rewind.

It is my hope that my review will be objective enough to help you make a valid determination before you expend time and money on it.

The plot summary on the DVD case reads: ""During a historic counter-terrorism summit in Spain, the President of the United States is struck down by an assassin's bullet.  Eight strangers have a perfect view of the kill, but what did they really see?  As the minutes leading up to the fatal shot are replayed through the eyes of each witness, the reality of the assassination takes shape.  But just when you think you know the answer, the shattering truth is finally revealed.  VANTAGE POINT is a mindbending political action-thriller starring Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox...Forest Whitaker...with Sigourney Weaver and...William Hurt..."" [ellipses mine]

Special features on the one-disc version include: ""Surveillance Tapes: Outtake""; ""An Inside Perspective: Interviews with the Cast & Crew""; ""Plotting an Assassination""; ""Coordinating Chaos: Stunt Featurette""; and ""Commentary with Director Pete Travis.""  I happened to watch three of the five, and I found them to be entertaining and worth seeing.  None that I watched were more than about 10 minutes long.

Having looked over some of the reviews for this movie (after I saw it), it seems that the two main aspects of the film that will likely make or break it for viewer are:  the ""rewinding"" of the movie 6 or 7 times (I didn't actually count) to show the same block of time and series of events from different points of view; and the extreme improbability of certain technical and action aspects of the movie.

I think your enjoyment level for this movie, then, will depend largely on what your expectations are.  If you want action, suspense, and intrigue, you certainly will not be disappointed.  I was looking for entertainment, and I found it in a big way in this movie.  If, however, you want the kind of movie where all technical elements and action sequences have to be reasonable, plausible, and precise, then you will certainly find aspects of the movie to be a disappointment or distraction and maybe even detract from the overall enjoyment.  A few examples to illustrate:  (1) The Secret Service agents who guard the President are just too easily eliminated by the bad guys.  (2) There is a pivotal moment in the movie (no spoilers here) when some chief bad guys have a pang of conscience that affects the plot's outcome in a major way.  (3) One of the terrorists has a cell phone that can do things no cell phone actually can.  (4) Dennis Quaid's character drives his car in an incredible chase scene that simply could never happen in real life without catastrophic damage to property and life.  The movie also does not seek to accomplish complex character development, but I do think the viewer will find enough of an emotional connection to the characters played by Dennis Quaid and Forest Whitaker in particular.

I personally found the movie to be a non-stop thrill, and it was one of the best action films I have seen in quite awhile.  Several well-known actors in the cast helped!  I also liked the ""rewinding"" of the movie so the events could be told from another perspective. I completely agree with the plot summary on the DVD case in that just when I thought I had figured out what was really going on, a different point of view was introduced that put a whole new twist on things.  I do agree with a few of the observations pointed out by the one-star reviewers who draw attention to the technical flaws and implausible elements.  For me, though, they were in no way fatal to the movie, and I was willing and able to look beyond them.

Unless you tend to be rather demanding of movies in terms of expecting technical flawlessness, I would find it hard to imagine that you could watch this movie and genuinely be disappointed.  Just for another perspective, I watched it with my two boys, ages 11 and 13, and they both were utterly impressed with it.

I give this movie five stars only because I can't give four-and-a-half.  Why not a solid five?  Simply to acknowledge that the technical flaws and implausible elements are there.  Had the writer and director been a little more creative in making these aspects more believable, I would not hesitate to rate this movie a solid five stars.",1249171200,2,4467,4.7685305591677505

Crashes. Plenty of weapons discharged. Explosions. Blood and gore. Brutal betrayal.  But very little artistry.

There is something fascinating about how different people see the same event from different perspectives. But this film grinds that concept into the ground.

Billed as a political thriller it is really primarily a chase film but that does not stop the audience from going on an enjoyable ride even if the facts of plot don't stand up on a close review.

Essentially what we have is a sort of political Groundhog Day with the movies first 20 minutes or so being replayed over and over from the point of view of characters who witnessed or were involved in the assassination of the President of the United States at the start of an anti-terrorism summit in Spain.

While the story is interesting the first few times we see it, it soon degenerates into a long car chase that while  propelling the film to its conclusion feels sort of flat. One positive here is that Travis has assembled a great cast much of which is unfortunately underused. While not a bad effort this one could have been much better.

The Blu-Ray disc offers excellent picture and sound quality as it should on such a recent release. The extras include a commentary by Travis, three making of featurettes and a preview gallery. The BluRay exclusive GPS Tracker was nowhere to be found on my disc.

And that is exactly what happens.  I thought it was pretty well done as each person's point of view rewinds events back to the time of the attack, and then branches off to their repsective perspectives.  And each flashback adds a little bit and piece to what happened and I found myself trying to tie each person and parts together.  Each piece added to the question of who was the good guy or gal, and who was the bad one.

It comes together towards the end with a rather traditional chase scene (which was also hinted at throughout the movie in the flashbacks.)  At the end everything gets resolved a bit neatly in terms of who gets what, and there were a couple of things that were a little annoying in that they did not make sense from what was shown of the charactors.  In other words some things bad guys would have done they did not do (do not want to play spolier though.)

But the small parts were not too objectionable in light of the fact that this is a general thriller and usually there will be one or two things that miss the mark.

There are other thrillers that are better, and some other movies portray the switching persepctive/stories better.  But if you just want to watch a general thriller that has a couple of warts, this one is good.

3328832,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Perhaps unintentionally, the makers of this flick have made it coincide with some real events. The scene of the assassination of the stand-in US President is reminiscent of St. Peter's Square, where Pope John Paul II was shot in 1981. The different viewpoints of what took place are reminiscent of the conflicting accounts of the assassination of JFK in 1963, which, of course, has encouraged conspiracy theories.

Is this flick designed to encourage Islamophobia? I think not. The real US President makes a statement in which he makes it clear that the 5 terrorists from Morocco should not be conflated with the 6 million peaceful citizens of that nation. He also realizes that the terrorists hope to provoke a US retaliation that would only antagonize peaceful Arabs.

Parts of the plot are farfetched: The assassins are totally successful, never make a mistake, and never encounter a serious obstacle to their plans. The car chasers encounter crash after crash without getting killed. A terrorist spins the car he is driving out of control in order to avoid hitting a little girl on the road. Is this intended to show that even the most cold-blooded of terrorists can have a heart?",1245024000,,1184,4.944723618090452
3328833,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Here's the skinny: Vantage Point covers an intense hourlong period in the lives of several key characters. At the culmination of a historic peace summit in Salamanca, Spain, an attempt is made on the life of the President of the United States. Each one of the primary characters sees and knows something about the true culprit. Over the course of the film, the hour is rewinded and replayed through the eyes of each character until, finally, the audience has the whole story.

This was a great action thriller. I loved the style and premise of the movie, and I really loved the fact that, even though the movie was largely about action, all the performers were really strong in their roles.

The cast was great, with heavy-hitters even in small roles. Matthew Fox plays Agent Taylor, who serves on the President's Secret Service detail. Dennis Quaid plays Agent Thomas Barnes, who's recently returned to the detail after taking a bullet for the President the previous year. William Hurt plays the Prez, and Sigourney Weaver has a great (but small) part as Rex, a television journalist on-site to cover the summit. Forest Whitaker turns in a touching performance as Howard, an American with a troubled marriage in town to observe the festivities. There are also several foreign actors in the film that you may not recognize, but who deliver the goods on screen just as well as their famous co-stars - Edgar Ramirez, Ayelet Zurer, Eduardo Noriega, and Said Taghmaqui.

I won't spoil how everything shakes out, but the ending had me on the very edge of my seat. I also think the movie made some interesting larger points about global politics and terrorism without bashing us all over the head.

3328834,2,B0012QCZ5O,"The problem with VANTAGE POINT is that it doesn't take into consideration two very important things: the point of view of the watcher, and a believable storyline. Let me explain...

Seeing a situation/crime/etc. from different points of view might be interesting to some. But if you're going to do that, you need to make sure that there are engaging points that aren't repeated ad nauseam. You might think that four or five points of view would be the maximum allowable for something like this. And you'd probably be right. But how about six? Or seven? Too many? Would you believe this one has eight?! Far, far, far too many. And they all start just about the same place, which grated on the nerves after a short while.

The storyline is pretty ridiculous, too. Doppleganger Presidents. Double Secret Service agents. Terrorists who need to hire an assassin. And an ending that is pure schlock.

Not being that much of a fan of Dennis Quaid didn't help matters for me either -- the only two films with him in them that I enjoyed were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-Mine/dp/B000059HAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy Mine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Easy/dp/6305262268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Easy</a>.

I will say, however, that the action was fun to watch. And seeing William Hurt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B001GMH8SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>) get shot multiple times was pretty enjoyable, too. But that's where my enjoyment stopped. Matthew Fox (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speed-Racer/dp/B001CD6FKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speed Racer</a>) as agent Kent Taylor was completely miscast and unbelievable. But probably the most miscast of all the characters was Forest Whitaker. Having seen Whitaker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-King-of-Scotland/dp/B000NIVJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last King of Scotland</a>, I know what he's capable of. Here, he seemed like an overweight but athletic American out of his league carrying a video camera through Spain because ...well ...we're not sure.

The big and final letdown was the ending of this film. If terrorists are prepared to kill, maim, and destroy innocent people in order to get to the President of the United States, would running over a girl stop them? I doubt that. Which made me nearly turn off the film. But we had to have a happy ending, sweet and sticky, with Quaid saving the day. Ugh.",1243641600,,3186,7.11734693877551

3328836,3,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" is not a boring way to spend ninety minutes.  It has an excellent cast featuring a couple of Academy Award winners, and it has special effects that harken back to the days when car chases really looked hazardous and explosions looked like they happened to buildings rather than in a computer.

That being said, all the characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is as well.  It just finished raining for about 15 minutes and the puddle outside my door is deeper than this movie.

The central story surrounds an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, played by William Hurt, while he is attending an historic anti-terrorism summit in Spain.  The film's central gimmick is that the same twenty minute period is shown repeatedly from several different perspectives.  The filmmakers insult the intelligence of the audience by ""fast-rewinding"" each twenty minute segment before starting on the ""next perspective"", so you know you're going backward in time, you know...

Each segment adds new information to what came before, and each segment extends what happened before by a few moments, until finally the ""rewinding"" stops and enough viewpoints have been introduced to allow a pretty exciting car chase with secret agents chasing bad guys and an ambulance holding the President being driven by more bad guys.

The first segment stars Sigourney Weaver as a tv news director covering the summit while choreographing her cameramen and the anchor, played by Zoe Saldana, who wants to cover the anti-American protestors as much as the Presidential summit.  After the President is shot there are two more explosions, the second one laying waste to the entire plaza and apparently killing everyone except for the handful of people whose viewpoints we are following.

The second segment follows secret service men Taylor and Barnes, played by Matthew Fox and Dennis Quaid. Many are surprised to see Quaid's Barnes there - a year earlier he was shot in another attempt on the President, and this is his first time back in the saddle.

Other segments follow American tourist Howard Lewis, played by Forest Whitaker, and the Spanish Mayor's bodyguard, played by Edgar Ramirez.  A final segment takes us behind the scenes with the President and his political advisors before rewinding one final time and letting the story play forward.

The terrorists behind the attack are shown to be more cunning and apparently better equipped than the forces around the President, but they are also paper-thin caricatures and other than a few throwaway lines about how long the war on terrorism has been going on, motivations are also as shallow as that puddle I mentioned earlier.",1242604800,,2693,5.093181818181818

Not a groundbreaking plot, but the way it's executed is certainly innovative,especially for the type of movie.  As alluded to by the title, the story is told several different times from several different angles - each time entirely from the perspective of a different character.  The different angles cross and intersect, same time covering the same incidents from a different viewpoint and other times uncovering new territory and events.  I've seen this kind of thing done before in Asian movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ju-On-2/dp/B000H0M4CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ju-On 2</a>&nbsp;but I'm not aware of it having been previously applied to a straight-up, gunfights-and-car-chases style action thriller.  As it turns out, the technique molds itself to this kind of material excellently, and makes what probably would have been a good movie anyway much better.  Extreme attention is paid to detail, and the seperate tellings of the same story mesh perfectly by movie's end.  We see events unfold from the eyes of the agents, the President, the terrorists, news reporters on the scene, and everyday civilians, with a talented cast filling out their roles to great effect.  At the end, not everything about motivation and the like is explained; it feels like a sequel may have been planned, but with this kind of movie you usually have to make several fortunes to get a sequel nowadays, and while Vantage Point did well at the box office and on DVD, I'm not sure it was as much as they were hoping for.  Too bad; a follow-up could have been great.  I envision a part-sequel, part-prequel told several different times from several different viewpoints, but this time spanning months or even years instead of a few hours.  Oh well, maybe we'll get a follow-up and maybe not; either way Vantage Point itself is a great action movie and a cerebral, engaging thriller.",1241481600,,2160,5.283625730994152

No. This movie shows the viewpoint of several people at an American Presidential address given in Spain. In these frightening global times, it played on my fears while entertaining me immensely. It made me think. The acting was great. It was fast-paced. You have to pay attention every moment of the movie. And it is relatively short- it got to the point quickly, in every scene.

Dennis Quaid has really grown as an actor, and it shows in this film. As he's aged, he's taken on a seriousness and an undercurrent of being in authority that I like a lot. He is still capable of displaying the vulnerability that makes him such a versatile actor, as well.

William Hurt, who plays the President, is (as usual) also excellent. He gave an understated performance that embodies the times we live in.

Forrest Whittaker provided a sweetness and innocence in his role as a bystander that was a good counter to the plot, which was so fraught with intrigue and deception.

Eight different perspectives superbly tied by an amazing edition process will tell us about an assassination attempt on the president of the United States, at the moment to make a public appearance in a public square.

The magnificent process of deconstruction and reconstruction of the different clues will allow us to arrange this sinister plan of conspiracy, that will even involve part of the very control system of presidential security.

The human gaze is given by an American citizen (Forest Whitaker) when unexpectedly he will record on his digital camera the different insights of this plot. Barnes (Dennis Quaid) is the main hunter who has been assigned as the master officer, William Hurt as the president is fabulous, while Sigourney Weaver plays an initial cameo as the top leader of GNN (an important news agency) and our national proud Edgar Ramirez as the blackmailed intruder who will have to make part of the nasty plan as a ruthless shooter.

It's impossible to forget two key films that truly worked out as clever inspirational  works: ""The day of the jackal"" (1973) and ""In the line of fire"" (1993).

3328857,3,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT is a dramatic action film told from multiple points of view. The movie is set in Spain and revolves around the President of the United States as he delivers an important speech during an anti-terrorism summit.  The movie follows the President of the United States (William Hurt), two Secret Service agents (Dennis Quaid & Matthew Fox) sworn to protect him, and several bystanders in the crowd (including Forest Whitaker). During the delivery of his message, an attempted assassination attempt is made which is soon followed by other attacks.  What follows is a loud and chaotic mess as agents and officials attempt to figure out what is going on.

The movie tells its story by showing a sequence of action from one character's particular point of view, then rewinding to where the story started but seen from the eyes of another character, or ""vantage point"".  Each time this happens the audience learns a new piece of information that can help in unraveling the puzzle or further confuse.  This isn't a new technique, but it is one that is rarely seen.

I enjoyed VANTAGE POINT. The acting is top-caliber and the story has just the right mix of action and suspense.  The story offers enough clues that those with Holmesian detective skills can figure out what's going on earlier in the movie, but leaving enough loose ends open to still be able to enjoy the movie.  When I first saw VANTAGE POINT in theatres, the crowd groaned after the action rewound for the third time back to the starting point.

3328883,4,B0012QCZ5O,"""What is truth?"" is the eternal question. The answer in this superior thriller is that truth depends on your vantage point, your position and role in events, who you know and what you witness. Things appear very different for the President of the United States than they do even for a lead Secret Service agent, much less for an American tourist with a movie camera, or for a little girl accompanying her mother. The key story -- which occupies only fifteen minutes of time but is repeated over and over -- concerns the attempted kidnapping of the President, who is in Spain for an anti-terrorism summit. When he's introduced in the Plaza Mayor, he's nailed by a sniper. And while the crowd is screaming and running in all directions, a bomb, tossed under the speaker's stand, detonates and turns the Plaza into a war zone. William Hurt, playing both the President and his double, is, . . . well, presidential. Dennis Quaid has aged craggily and makes a quite believable member of the security detail. Eduardo Noriega, not well known in the U.S., is good as a dedicated member of the Spanish national police, and Edgar Ramirez is scary as the head of the terrorist crew. Forest Whitaker is Howard Lewis, whose camera in the crowd picks up key information, and who joins the chase for no discernible reason than that it's happening. This marvelous film is actually much more innovative in its structure than the professional reviewers have given it credit for. They keep comparing it to Rashomon, but that's not really valid. Kurosawa gave us multiple versions of the same events and asked us to choose among them. Here we start with a lot of unanswered questions and misunderstandings on the part of its multiple-viewpoint characters, but we gradually home in on the true course of the depicted events.

You are seeing from about six different vantage points or points of view what was happening in an assassination attempt on the US president in Spain.  He is there for an anti-terrorist conference with over 100 nations present both east and west.  What is interesting about this way of doing the movie is that you get a lot of information about a very short period of time from the perspective of 6 or more individuals.  The story comes out as to who is involved and how with the rewinding and viewing from the perspective of the newsroom, a couple of terrorists, a bystander, the president himself, and a member of the Secret Service.

It would be impossible and way too choppy to have had all of these scenes from all angles if the movie was layed out like a typical piece.  Here is like the peeling back of an onion, each layer is an onion but a little different.  By doing this, we get a full picture and are left with an answer to what just happened.  Which is a question that Sigorney Weaver asks before the first rewind.

There are blasts that you hear in the distance, you get the answer for that, about half way through.  The last sequence is a coallecsing of scenes when we are taken on a spectacular car chase through the streets of Salamanca.  As the story unfolds, things seem to get worse for our hero, played by Dennis Quaid.

3328920,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I had high hopes for vantage point, a movie in which Dennis Quaid and Forrest Whitaker play significant roles.  It is a very short movie and personally I think the reason they show the movie from 5 different angles is because they did not have enough of a story line to put together a full 90 minute film.

Be ready immediately to watch the first 10 minutes of the movie 5 separate times and then on the 6th time watch it from all the angles until the finish.  Honestly none of the so called Vantage Points are that convincing or shocking.  It is fairly easy from the beginning to pick out who the terrorists are.  One thing that was extremely frustrating was that the movie made the U.S. secret service look like a bunch of incompetent idiots that had no training.

Yes the action is entertaining with one of the most unrealistic car scenes I have ever seen but I think there are so many better choices out there to watch a good action flick.  I advise you, pass on this movie and 90 minutes of your life will be saved.",1226793600,,1020,4.30890052356021

3328922,1,B0012QCZ5O,Horrible movie and acting. Horrible story line and worse its political message makes me puke every time I hear about this sorry movie. Forest Whitaker is so bad in this movie I can't believe it. Anti-American BS is all over this movie. Outrageously cheap and bad. Zero Star!,1226707200,6,274,4.729166666666667
3328923,3,B0012QCZ5O,"Well, I doubt anyone will fall asleep watching this film. That's the best feature of this movie: it's very entertaining and once you start it, it's tough to put down. Being only 90 minutes, it's a quick hour-and-a-half. It also helps to know that you are going to get the story told from a handful of angles, so expect to see similar scenes running over and over, each with a few new wrinkles added.

Also, expect a lot of the action scenes that are both fun to view but not very credible. My favorite - spoiler alert! - of that is when ""Thomas Barne's"" (Dennis Quaid) little blue car is totally bashed in by a huge 18-wheeler. Not only that, the car is smashed up against a brick wall. It should look like a metal pancake. Seconds later, Quaid emerges from the wreck and is running down the street like a football halfback shooting his pistol! He hardly has a scratch on him, and the limp disappears after about three strides!

Whatever, it's a fun ride not to be taken seriously but as a short entertainment diversion. The twists are fun to see, too, as the same-but-similar story slowly unwinds and all the pieces finally fall into place by the end.....even though, how they do manage that is by stretching things a bit!",1226620800,,1223,4.479820627802691

The Blu Ray was very good  and I found the sound to be exceptional.  The explosions could be felt throughout the house, only problem is that the same explosion happened eight times.  The car chase reminded me of the Bourne movies and was very exciting.  I do have one issue with the car chase and that is for a movie that attempts to be as realistiic as possible it is annoying to watch cars crash over and over again but still aquire no damage when seen from a distance.  I might be nit picking but it is a pet peave of mine.  Overall it is worth the watch!",1226275200,,721,4.143884892086331
3328946,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I bought Vantage Point in a '3 DVDS for 15' sale at the supermarket. Always a bad sign, especially if a film's only been out a month or so... but I'm a sucker for a bargain, and anyway, the cast looked good.

Another giveaway for a 'stinker' is the running time. This one clocks in at only 80 minutes, suggesting it has been butchered by a despairing crew in the editing suite, who realised its flimsy one-dimensional story couldn't possibly stand up for any longer than this. Or even, indeed, that it collapsed on its weedy pencil-thin legs within 10 minutes and lay there floundering on its back like an irritating cockroach just waiting to be squished.

So.. just 80 minutes long. It gets a bonus star for not wasting too much of my life.

But then it loses three when you discover that the first 50 minutes of it is seeing the same sequence over and over again, from the viewpoints of different characters.

Quite why this was done, or what it added to the plot, is beyond me.
I thought there'd be some breathtaking double whammy at the end where, for example, they were all in it together, or that we had to piece together cleverly written clues in each segment to reveal the true shock-horror conspiracy behind the sequence of events, or something.

But no. That was way beyond the hyper young fools behind this project. What you see is a flat one-dimensional storyline, with a dull seen-it-all-before car chase tagged on it at the end. And, er, that's it.

None of the characters have any depth. They all do ludicrous out-of-character things at critical moments. The good guy who's really a bad guy is obvious from the moment you see him. And the plot is riddled with more holes than a bullet-riddled sieve.

But just why is it so bad? Have we any more clues on this DVD?

If you can bear it, I suggest you just watch a bit of the 'making of' extra on the DVD and reel back in open-mouthed horror and astonishment at the young stupid boys behind this project.

A director who looks about 20 years old with a wild 'kewpie doll' orange haircut.

A scriptwriter whose loving description of his masterpiece resembles that of a rather thick third-former trying to convince his teacher that his English essay isn't the crock of C-minus doggie-doo that everybody else in the class knows it is.

A shedload of other young 'creatives' all doing their jobs on the set, all indulging themselves in the most criminal waste of money since the banks collapsed on both sides of the Atlantic.

How in the name of God did these talentless berks get a multi-million pound budget to blow on their lamebrain schoolboy drivel?

The final indignity is to watch the 'Making Of' feature and see the likes of Sigourney Weaver, who really should know better, sit there all breathless and wide-eyed and animated, desperately hyping it up as some sort of 'must-see thriller of the year', when she knows and we know and anyone with an ounce of brain cells in his bonce knows she and her fellow stars are vamping up a pile of old bilgewater... and are only babbling in this crazy manner as part of their contractual duties to promote the film.

It's the best acting you'll see on this whole DVD.",1225929600,,3172,4.551845342706502

Each time the story ""reset"" so that you could see it from another vantage point, it was like an entirely new story that gave you more pieces of a puzzle. Like a puzzle, you're given more pieces until you can see the full story. It just became more and more exciting and even nerve wracking because it was an intense story. One segment built upon another, and led to a very exciting and edge of your seat ending. We never found it to be repetitive or boring.

This is a movie that makes you think. The concept of the format was creative and intelligent. Of course it's also full of action, and it has well developed characters that you really come to care about. The acting was excellent.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries, suspense and some action. However you may have to think a bit, so keep that in mind! This may not be a good movie for you if you're looking to have a couple of mindless hours to decompress or relax.

I'm not going to mention any details about that Salamanca where people speak (and sometimes even look) like Mexicans, American trucks drive in American highways, a Mexican train makes a nice contrast against a view of the city and so on. Let's focus on that stupid summit with one guy who looks like from the Middle East, another one like an African dictator and an American president raising his arms in a sign of victory in front of a crowd gathered in the same way they would be for the Sunday market (so easy to get in and out of the Plaza Mayor, you can invite all your terrorist friends to join us!). The rest of the plot follows this ""wonderful"" beginning supported by two essential ingredients in similar low quality Hollywood movies: the hero with some dramatic problems (here the thing is apparently some stomachache that makes Dennis Quaid's face turn into something painful from time to time at the beginning of the movie to show us how great a hero he is despite those pains) and second, the little girl (oh, the little girl!): don't miss the part where the Mexican or Centroamerican girl (nothing against any nationality but please, don't tell me you shot the entire movie in Spain!!) is in danger: one of the most pathetic scenes in movie history. I really recommend that you watch the movie with a big group of friends (especially if you have some from Spain), make some pop-corn and prepare to laugh with all the 'intelligent"" moments in the film.

I can't believe there aren't many more 1 star reviews on this horrible movie.

Wow, where do we start. Well, how about with the cell phone. It is fortunate for the free world that the bad guy hadn't completely read the owners manual because it would have meant some serious trouble for the rest of us. I'm sure the phone also has the ability to remotely fly Air Force 1, make the lights go and off in every office building in Spain, and order a pizza at the same time. Controlling a sniper rifle is child's play for that thing.

Do we really believe that the Secret Service is that inept? I've actually known Secret Service guys - that one lone bad guy dude at the end, THAT is the way THEY are. Talking about that super bad dude. Can anyone please explain to me why he put a mask over his face? He kills a squad of highly trained agents, then puts on his mask, kills a dozen more agents to the point where there is NO ONE LEFT (save one) and then he takes off his mask??!!!  Why put it on in the first place???!!!

Then there is the ridiculous child in the movie. As someone else pointed out, these guys kill scores of innocent people but the guy has a case of consciousness at the end and rolls over his vehicle? What?? NO NO NO - a true bad guy (and this guy was) was not going to stop. Terrorists do not brake for Raccoons, squirrels, or little girls.

Why was Weaver in this movie?

I had no idea it was so so easy to place and transport bombs from place to place where the President was going to be. This movie has let out all of its secrets - who knew?

The plot was absolutely ridiculous. These movie makers know NOTHING about security. It is true that most people don't either, but you know watching this movie that even though you may not know much about it, there is common sense. Common sense would tell you that this movie was total crap.

Oh - another thing. Since when would you ever see a Russian, Chinese, or French secret service agent equivalent running through OUR streets, car jacking by simply flashing their Chinese/Russian/French badge, and firing shots into the air after a ""suspect"", who just so happens to be a policeman of OUR country. Heck not only shooting into the air but AT the suspect in a street full of innocent people. ""Our"" innocent people. Would any of us stand for that? Would any country stand for our secret service agents driving down their streets and shooting at people indiscriminately? Secondly, if one of them fires his gun half a dozen times (or was it a dozen, in all of the excitement I lost track myself) you would think they would be good enough to HIT their target. Of course the super bad dude NEVER missed. That is why I call him the ""super"" bad dude.

Do not waste your time with this movie. The trailer showed great promise and I am sure that this ""could"" have been a great movie. What an utter disappointment.

3328991,1,B0012QCZ5O,"This movie sports an all-star cast, but that is about all it has going for it.  Firstly, it is too short for all the action in it yet it still tries to develop characters and that just falls flat. We get about 30 seconds of a character's background.  Secondly, the events are completely unreasonable.  The details of the terrorist attack are just non-sensical considering the amount of the security that occurs in any function involving the President.  A few terrorists kill a troop of secret service men as if those guarding the President were henchman working for Dr. Evil in an Austin Power's movie. Thirdly, no reason is ever given for why a group of hodge-podge Moroccans would kill dozens of innocent people and the President of the USA.  The characters in on the plot could or would never pull it off either.

The worst aspect of the movie is the attempt to create suspense by continually rewinding the events and showing the same time period from about 6-7 different characters' ""vantage points.""  The result is that it completely disrupts any flow the movie would have and prevents viewers from connecting with any of the characters.  All-in-all it leads to only about 15 mins. worth of actual time passing in the movie's events.

The ending also is illogical, not to mention the impossibility of a secret service agent in a high speed chase through unfamilar narrow streets filled with cars and pedstrians, on the sidewalk, down stairs, shifting, sliding, turning, etc and of course making cell phone calls, then getting completely smashed by a big truck and a wall, and surprise..getting out and chasing down the bad guys.",1220140800,7,1633,4.845323741007194
3328992,4,B0012QCZ5O,"I enjoyed this movie, and I enjoyed the gimmick of the film. One of my favorite books is Orson Scott Cards ""Ender's Shadow"", which is exactly the same story as his book ""Enders Game"" except it is told by a different character. While ""Vantage Point"" doesn't rise anywhere near to the books I just mentioned, I like that looking from different viewpoints and vantage points can make a story quite different. In this film, it was interesting trying to figure out who were the bad guys before you see for yourself, and it had the effect of going to a criminal trial, and hearing testimony from different individuals to get at the truth. If that sounds like fun to you, then you will probably like this as well.

On the downside, the story that turned out to be the actual events was quite convoluted, and pretty implausible. Some little things about the main characters motivation were not fleshed out enough to engage an emotional response from the audience.

That's the simple way of saying without good memory recall a viewer might get lost in the crowd.  I'd also class this film as one to use with certain rehab patients.  Not joking here - often films have multiple uses as well as audiences.  Another plus with ""Advantage Point"" is the involvement of citizen spectators during a national crisis, a reminder of 9/11.  The tourist becomes a hero just because he/she was filming the surrounding as the fatal attack begins.  Outstanding scenery, plots, characters, and more.

The first hour of the movie is basically a loop of the same action, but from various different perspectives, or Vantage Points, of several key players that witness a diabolical scheme to assassinate The President of the United States.

You may know already that one of my biggest pet peeves is spoilers. I hate spoilers. And I'm not about to write one out here so don't worry. But if you've ever seen the trailer for Vantage Point and then watch the movie, you'll be like, ""why the heck did they give away that critical twist?"" In fact, the trailer for this movie goes so far as to (deliberately) misdirect you into preconceiving who the bad guys are.

But why??? Did the director or producers think that their movie would be too obvious and predictable without the misdirection? I don't think it would have been. On the contrary, the misdirection made Vantage Point seem like it would be another one of the many government conspiracy theory movies. But it's not. And I think that the marketing of this movie contributed to its lackluster box office performance.

Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are great. Forest Whitaker's character is completely unbelievable...as in, it's hard to swallow a single action that Whitaker's character makes.

I rather liked the thriller ""Vantage Point.""  The repetition of the movie's story from the different points of view of the main characters affords the movie a nightmarish quality.  It's like you have to keep reliving a nightmare over and over making it that much more hellish, the tension mounting with each reliving.  You feel trapped with no escape.  You know what's going to happen and there's nothing you can do about it.  The strands of the plot come together plausibly when the ambulance careens toward the little girl on the street, and in the ensuing violence and car crashes the story is resolved satisfactorily.",1218844800,,764,5.846846846846847

However, here the inconsistencies, illogic and absurdities pile up at an annoying pace.  This prevented me from having any investment in the story.

The underlying sequence of events is not that substantial (in addition to painfully contrived).  Consequently, the different vantage points have a disproportionate amount of repetition relative to the new information that is layered on.  My reaction at the end was ""Is that all there was?""

Two of the worst, most unforgivable absurdities (see other reviews for many more examples):
1. The bomb does far more damage to a hotel well over a mile away than it does to the immediately surrounding buildings.  This is absolutely essential to the plot.
2. Although there has been a major terrorist attack, life a few blocks away (short walking distance) proceeds as if nothing has happened. There is no stream of ambulances, police, ...",1218844800,,1012,5.171779141104294

3329030,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point, a fast-paced, super-charged, action-thriller, stands also as a melodramatic comment on terrorism and politics with alot of pep and plenty of suprises.
  The surprises, possibly being the best selling point of the movie, start out with a trickle-down plotline that returns us to the same terrorist attack numerous times during a massive conference in Spain.  This allows us to see the same tragic moment from several different characters' viewpoints without letting us in on the secret cause of the attack.  Yes, the movie returns to the start quite a few times, and this allows for a bit of foreshadowing as we become involved and engrossed into a Hitchcockian-style timeline (Which means it is full of suspense).
  As the film developes, and the truth behind the suspense becomes apparent, we see more of how climax is used in most movies today.  The difference of Vantage Point is in the flashbacks.  They allow us not to figure out what might happen at the end, but they give us a journey filled with different character actions, plot-lines, dangerous events and impossible situations leading us up to that one horrifying terrorist occurrence.
  The film is colorful and slightly commercial, but it also allows us to feel how frightening it is to deal with the possibility of an assassination attempt of an American President; here played well by top-notch actor William Hurt.
  Dennis Quaid is superb as a paranoid, worried secret service agent, always on the alert as a result of a previously almost-botched attempt on the life of the same President in the '70's.  We feel the Quaid character all-too-well, his rising anxiety and emotions delivered with one of his best performances.
  Forrest Whitaker appears as a lone tourist on vacation who manages to capture several different viewpoints of the same event.  His character is the representation of the hero in us all and he provides a peformance that is dynamic and heroic yet realistic.
  The beautiful and talented Sigourney Weaver makes an appearence as a top news woman covering the event, providing the catalyst for experiencing both the professional yet emotional sides to covering a life-threatening terrorist attack.
  As the movie progresses, no one is quite sure who is on whos' side as a series of twists, double-crosses and betrayals lead up to the final explosive twenty minutes.  When all the characters finally come together and the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit, we are treated to a tremendously fast and violent car chase with Quaid at the wheel in pursuit of the terorists or would-be terrorists.  How the movie will turn out is still left up to our ability to decide who is the true villian behind the attack, as characters, CIA agents, politicians and extras all scramble amidst the beautiful backdrop of Spain.
  Vantage Point may seem similar to the other political/terrorist film of that same year, Rendition, but both differ in their intensity and in how they treat the subject matter of what could go wrong for everyone when terrorist plots can and will strike us all anywhere, anytime.",1217808000,2,3089,4.98828125

3329048,2,B0012QCZ5O,"`Vantage Point' is one of those movies that drew me by its trailer.  At a kinetic pace we see a frenetic adventure as an assassination attempt on the President takes place, while a ""double""** of him has been placed on his behalf on stage at a terrorist summit in Salamanca, Spain.  Interlocking pieces fit together to give us a composite of conspiracy and treachery.  Perhaps having high expectations I was more than a little disappointed with this mystery-thriller ride.  I generally give most movies the benefit of the doubt, for being a news junkie, I find real-life stories often inspire or scotch what we see on the screen. ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" I often quote.  This time there are definitely some credibility issues afoot.

Many witnesses see the assassination attempt of  President Ashland (William Hurt).  On the platform in Plaza Mayor are two secret service agents, Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and Taylor (Matthew Fox), overseeing all danger signs.  In the square is bearded Enrique (Eduardo Noriega).  He looks like a revolutionary, but must be a plain-clothes police officer.  When the President's double is shot, he rushes the stage.  Is it treachery?  Or is it duty?  Connected to him is Veronica (Ayelet Zurer).  Together they talk about another man.  Is she seeing someone else?  Or is he their sinister connection?  Time will tell.  She has connections with Javier (Edgar Ramirez) who must be the other man.  More ambiguity fills their conversation.

Also in attendance is Howard, an American tourist with a video camera.  He's left his wife behind to tour Europe, and now he's getting everything on tape.  He meets a woman when he bumps into her little girl and offers to buy her a new ice cream cone.  Another point-of-view is provided by GNN (Global News Network) headed by program manager, Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver).  After the attempt, Agent Barnes bursts into their headquarters watching the tragedy on tape.  Often times what Barnes sees is hidden from us--to be revealed at a later time.  Meanwhile, one of the characters is desperately trying to get his brother released as a hostage.

I have to give the film some credit for ingenuity.  They have showcased another flashy format in their approach.  Trouble is we don't really get to know the characters.  Before we get a chance to love or loathe them, the movie backs up about fifteen minutes to show us the proceedings from another's eyes.  Unlike, say '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/6305161968/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>' where we truly care about the angst in people's lives, all we can do here is commiserate their situations.  (If you thought 'Crash' was too coincidental, just wait until you get a load of this.)  Tragically, this spills over into the ""whodunit"" or puzzle portion of the film's alleged draw.  If some of the narrative is meant to give us ""clues"" as to the guilty parties, it becomes a ""tacked-on"" exercise during the revelations of the denouement.  There are few ""ah-ha's"" in the resolution.

I also have problems with Horace.  He captures everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on tape.  What he doesn't film on his video camera, he makes up by being there for the continuing drama.  Always at the right place at the right time.  There are lucky Pulitzer Prize winning journalists with luck less than his.  And what about the double?  I've seen Hollywood doubles, and there's a resemblance.  Sigourney Weaver or at least somebody would catch it, but, no, William Hurt's clone is on stage.  After the mayor makes a gracious speech, the President always says something.  At least, ""Gracias"".  Of course he gets shot, but what were they planning to do if he didn't get shot?  Does he do impressions of the President as well?

The acting?  One of the biggest challenges I believe an actor faces is facing a tragedy.  After all, how many ways can you say, ""Oh, my Gawd!""?  Forest Whitaker gets my vote for the best in this high-tech puzzler, but Sigourney Weaver delivers her usual goods as well.  I can't say I'm inspired either way about the rest, but again I try to fit myself in their shoes:  The how to muster the awful-without-sounding-like-it actor's syndrome.

With all the grandiose deception, I have to use a word I've never used before:  contrived.  Yes, I hate that deadly word, for I'd hate to be responsible for being wrong.  It's like an assassination of a movie, so I've never used it before---until now.  You have to be careful.  It's not something to use lightly.

Alicia Jaziz Zapien did an admirable job as the little girl. But, then, it was easy for her to act terrified when filming requirements meant that she really did almost get hit by that ambulance.

3329051,5,B0012QCZ5O,"VANTAGE POINT was a movie whose preview seemed to play nearly every time I went to the theater. So much so that by the time the movie was released I was tired of seeing it. A major mistake on my point as this was one of the most thrilling movies I've seen in years.

The film revolves around a visit by the US President (William Hurt) to a conference on terrorism in Spain. Several countries have agreed to back his proposal in and effort to stop the killing. As the President walks to the podium in an open air square where the conference is taking place, he is shot by an assassin's bullet. This starts the film.

But there is more to it than that. As the title states, the film is offered from various vantage points of the same scene. The opening scene is offered via a news network's truck as it watches the carnage that happens when the President is not only shot but a bomb blows up in the public square.

Through them we are introduced to Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) and lead Agent Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox). These are the agents in charge of protecting the President, a job Barnes knows well as less than a year earlier he took a bullet while protecting him. On edge and looking for signs of trouble, Barnes' sharp eye and instincts kick in just before the shot is fired.

But Barnes' perception is not the last we are offered. We are also given the viewpoint of Enrigue (Eduardo Noriega), a policeman who becomes suspect by the Secret Service when he rushes the podium to protect the President. Another view is offered through the eyes of vacationer Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) who is filming all he sees with his new camcorder. An important view is that of the President himself when we learn it was not him but his double who took the bullet! The last view offered is that of the terrorists whose job was to kill the President...or was it?

Each section takes a 23 minute time period and condenses it to offer the varying viewpoints of each character. And with each differing viewpoint we as viewers ourselves are offered more clues as to just who is behind the assassination attempt. Until the last view offered I had no firm idea.

Movies have been called white knuckle rides but this movie fulfills that line to a T. The breakneck pace of the film, while showing us the same basic scene over and over, holds you in its grip not just for the carnage that ensues but because of the action that follows. Leads are discovered and agents set in motion as they try to capture the person responsible.

Many people have claimed that THE FRENCH CONNECTION or BULLIT or lately the Bourne films have offered the greatest car chases of all times. I think that title can now be taken by the stunt drivers in this film. Moving at breakneck speed through tiny streets that are little more than alleys filled with pedestrians and cars takes your breath away.

All performances are top of the line. While Quaid's might seem one note, that is actually the demeanor of Secret Service agents. Their job IS to protect the President and nothing more. It happens in this film. High speed, explosive and breathtaking are all apt descriptions of this movie.

Unfortunately I did just that and when I came back I found the repeated story telling (from a different vantage point) too tiresome. Unlike the Denzel Washington starrer ""Courage Under Fire"" which also used the Rashomon effect, Vantage Point is in more agreement with the Rashomon effect because the incidents from each vantage point adhere to the truth than falsehood that the characters of the former movie confess. The screenplay can get boring due to the repeated story telling but towards the end all is compensated with the twist which was worth the some-what tiresome wait. Crowd participation and control in the outdoor scenes were good too. Filming mostly outdoors is challenging but it is done well in Vantage Point.

Vantage Point is a good movie for Dennis Quaid. His role reminds one of Clint Eastwood who played a similar role in ""In the line of Fire"".I also wondered why some senior actors such as Sigourney Weaver and Forest Whitaker to some extent, had very small roles to play. There is one very good car chase. Spain is beautifully pictured. Nice to see William Hurt back in popular movies these days.

Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to dwell on the supposed GLARING shortcomings of the film.  I suspect some ""critics"" are conditioned/programmed to be oh so discerning that they can't see the forest for the trees - this was a thrilling, action-packed, and rather clever way of looking at an intense incident and is an excellent example of the age-old adage that truth is relative.

3329075,3,B0012QCZ5O,"Vantage Point is a slick thriller that uses a gimmick to tell an intriguing story about an attack on a terrorism summit in Spain. William Hurt is President Ashton and is about to speak to a gathered crowd in a large outdoor plaza. He's killed by two gunshots. With the crown panicked, an explosion goes off in the disance. Moments later, a large bomb detonates underneath the podium where the President had been speaking. The movie starts with the gimmick, showing the assassination and then bomb explosion from the point of view of Sigourney Weaver. Weaver is directing the coverage of the event in an control truck for the Global News Network. The movie then portrays the events of the attack from several point of views: Secret Service Agent Dennis Quaid who is just coming back on duty after being injured saving the president; Forrest Whitaker, a kind heart tourist, a spanish police officer, the president, the terrorist leader, etc. I lost track of how many points of view are utilized.

This movie should be watched just for the uniqueness of the storytelling. It's not groundbreaking or earth shattering, but it should keep your interest. Some scenes are repeated during each point of view shift, and its fun to pick out bits and pieces you've already seen and see how they relate.

That is how this movie is, times 6, because of the 6 different vantage points that the film is based on.  Not until you get to the last box that you are unwrapping do you see how all of the parts fit together, and that is really what spins this movie.

At first this is not an issue but by the fifth or sixth segment you may be ready to fast forward the movie, don't or you will miss some key dialogue. Although as I said it may test your patience a little towards the end, the pay-off is worth it. Overall a good action thriller with a good acting, decent story, and good camera work and effects. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""The Sentinel"", ""The Jackal"", and ""In the Line of Fire"". - C. Luster",1216252800,2,1176,4.604761904761904
3329081,3,B0012QCZ5O,"There is no argument that first-time feature director Pete Travis maneuvers this 2008 action thriller with propulsive intensity throughout its surprisingly fleet ninety-minute running time, but contrivance and coincidence seem to be the two guiding forces behind the overly tricked-out screenplay by first-time screenwriter Barry L. Levy. The concept starts promisingly as it aspires to be a contemporary take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rashomon/dp/B00003CXC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rashomon</a>, Akira Kurosawa's classic melodrama about the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy. Under the guise of a political thriller, however, the film only replicates one part of Kurosawa's cinematic equation - showing the multiple perspectives of the participants to a traumatic event - without really addressing the complexity behind the individual perceptions. The basis of the differences in perspective lies wholly within the facts to which each participant is exposed. Consequently, Travis and Levy use the recycling gimmick to peel away components of the central assassination plot until we are left with a straight-ahead finale that is as ludicrous as it is chaotic.

As just seen in Jieho Lee's even more preposterous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Air-I-Breathe/dp/B0014Z4OKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Air I Breathe</a>, Paul Haggis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>&nbsp;has inspired yet another overly connected storyline that sacrifices any sense of realism for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B000VWLMEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>-style cliffhanger plot devices. This time, the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain is the setting for an anti-terrorism summit among 150 world leaders at which U.S. President Henry Ashton is about to speak onstage. He is shot twice after which there is an explosion some distance away from the square, and then a few minutes later, a bomb explodes under the stage causing several casualties. This all occurs over a twenty-three-minute period, and it is first seen most effectively through the eyes of a CNN-type news crew led by veteran news producer Rex Brooks. Their viewpoint ends when their onsite reporter is killed in the bombing. The movie is strong in a pulpy way up to this point, but then we see the same series of events six times over. The second perspective shows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes and Kent Taylor on active duty. Just back after recovering from a nervous breakdown brought on by another presidential assassination attempt a year earlier, Barnes is especially anxiety-driven during the events that unfold.

The third viewpoint is that of a Spanish police officer named Enrique who may or may not have a connection to the terrorists involved. By the time we see the same events a fourth time, the novelty has genuinely worn off as we see everything again from American tourist Howard Lewis' perspective and then once again from the President himself. These particular episodes spin into an incredulous series of circumstances that lead to the final viewpoint represented by the terrorists themselves. The plot finally moves forward in time once we are privy to what all the participants experience. Performances prove to be secondary in a labyrinth thriller like this, although Dennis Quaid registers the most as the tortured and heroically persistent Barnes, and William Hurt shows true executive lan in the surprisingly meaty role of Ashton. Forest Whitaker valiantly attempts to make the most of a no-win role as Lewis as his character becomes more far-fetched. A similar problem befalls Matthew Fox as Taylor, but Sigourney Weaver has no problem acting authoritative in a near-cameo as Brooks during the best ten minutes of the movie.

An international supporting cast fills the remaining key roles expertly - Spain's Eduardo Noriega, Venezuela's dgar Ramirez, France's Sad Taghmaoui (Amir's driver in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kite-Runner/dp/B0012OX7EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kite Runner</a>), and Israel's Ayelet Zurer (Avner's wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Munich/dp/B000F1IQN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Munich</a>). Interestingly, while the plot could have been fodder for an anti-Bush political diatribe, the film holds back from such easy targets. The downside, however, is a murkiness in character motivation that is never really clarified beyond the basic good-versus-bad dynamics. Features on the 2008 DVD are pretty standard with Travis going solo on the film's commentary track. While he provides insight, interactive dialogue with Levy or some of the principal cast could have held more interest. The making-of featurette, ""An Inside Perspective"" runs nearly a half-hour and provides the standard back-slapping from cast and crew as well as behind-the-scenes footage. The sixteen-minute ""Plotting an Assassination"" seems repetitive even with the focus purely on the script and the characters. The seven-minute ""Coordinating Chaos"" focuses on the elaborate stunts, especially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/6304698526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>-style car chase that was filmed in Mexico City doubling for Salamanca.

The movie illuminates some of the major problems with not only the United States but also the world's handling of diplomacy, information transfer, terrorism, and law enforcement.

3329084,4,B0012QCZ5O,"This is a movie that plays with your perceptions and expectations.  William Hurt plays the President of the United States in a time of Global Terror.  He attends a conference in Spain and is shot.  Dennis Quaid plays Thomas Barnes, a Secret Service Agent who is brought back for this event after being shot and nearly losing his life a year earlier.

The first half of the movie shows us the event, rewinds and shows us events from another person's point of view, and does that four times (as I recall).  After that we think we have the pieces together and the movie tells its narratives as some of the previous views converge for different reasons.  I really don't want to say any more about the plot.

I thought it was a pretty good and entertaining movie.  Quaid gives a solid performance as a serious, brave, but understandably tentative agent.  William Hurt is good in his smallish role.  Forest Whitaker gives the movie an emotional center.  Sigourney Weaver, Bruce McGill, Matthew Fox, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, and several others fill out a really good cast.

While not a great film, it is worth seeing.

On the negative side of the ledger I think the relentless rewind back in time to the events just prior to the terrorist attack was relentless and overdone, ultimately distracting the focus of the audience to such an extent as to cause them to lose interest in the eventual outcome.

The other bothersome and most unbelievable part of the storyline was the role of the American tourist (Forest Witaker) and his always in the right spot with the perfect camera angle luck. How that camera always happened to be aimed in the right direction and stay in focus was a miracle in itself.

Overall good for one watch but please don't ask me to sit through it again. Be sure to have a large cup of coffee before viewing, it's the only way you'll be able to keep up with the action.

3329096,4,B0012QCZ5O,"This film is unique to me in how the plot unfolds. Quickly I knew that some people were not who they claimed to be, but I was still surprised over and over again. The plot is quite complicated actually. You're good if you watch it only once and walk away understanding the motives of each character and his or her role in the entire event. I myself watched it once and then watched the second half over again because it was about half-way through that things got hairy. To me, though, this only adds to the film. I consider it even better if I need to watch a movie more than once to fully understand it (consider Memento). Please note this movie is not nearly on the level of the complexity of Memento, though.
I gave the movie 4 stars because I thought the plot was a bit spotty, and I feel in the end that it has holes in it. Maybe I'm just not smart enough. Could be. But...you also get the typical Hollywood deaths - here one person dies conveniently instantly while another lives to speak a few important lines. Some people are killed with just a knife to the back, and sometimes one hit is all it takes to bring down a guy. You get the classic rag-over-the-mouth-guy-passes-out capture and take down. Silly. So the deaths could have been more realistic. Still, it is Hollywood.
Anyway, bottom line: you have to see this movie. The story lacks depth, but the intricacies of the ploy are fantastic and figuring out the roles of each person is a blast. For the people who completely hated it, you were probably just utterly confused. So, if you're not to keen and quick-witted, you might want to avoid this movie.",1215734400,,1617,4.429530201342282

Naturally, GNN (Global Network News) has a huge crew on the scene.  The on the ground producer Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) is trying to keep things running smoothly.  Just as President Ashton (William Hurt) steps up to the stage, he is shot.  As the jittery crowd begins to react, there is an explosion.

Back up to the beginning of the events.  Two secret service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox) are at the President's hotel.  They accompany him to the town square and are standing on stage.  Tom (Dennis Quaid) is convinced he saw something from an upstairs window.  Just as other agents report it was just a fan, the President is shot.  Tom quickly grabs the camera of a tourist in the crowd (Forest Whitaker) to see if he captured any pertinent information while the other agent tries to catch the shooter who they think was in a different window.

Back up to the beginning of the events....

They flip back and forth several times, each time giving us the events from a slightly different point of view and leaving us with another cliffhanger.  Finally, they begin to show us how all these different points of view come together.

Sort of.

The movie starts out using the multiple points of view well.  With each retelling of the events, we see a slightly different piece of the puzzle.  How all these events fit together is left up in the air until the end.

But it's the end where the unique storytelling falls apart.  While all of our main characters play a part in the climax, only we know how.  I was a little disappointed with that because I was expecting all the characters to work together to find the solution.  Instead, coincidence ruled the day.

I found the repetitive flashbacks interesting at first, but eventually annoying.  It spends an hour on stuff we already know, just giving us a small bit of new information every time.  But when we get beyond that, the pay off is worth it.  The action isn't believable, but I was glued to my seat as the climax unfolded.

Here's a brief aside for you.  Part of the background color of the movie is a bunch of anti-America protesters.  That's fine.  But twice as they panned across the crowd, I clearly saw a sign that had a W crossed out.  The current US President has nothing to do with anything in the film.  Either the producers just used some footage from a protest and didn't catch that or they were trying to sneak in a political statement.  Which ever it was, I found it distracting.

Once the film got into the point of view of President Ashton (William Hurt) the movie actually had a fairly good payoff, only to be ultimately ruined in the end, but I'll get to that. Once Secret Service Agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) puts his finger on the pulse of the assassination attempt and multiple bombings, after a god-awful amount of rewinds that have us watching the movie from multiple VANTAGE POINTS, the movie kicks into high gear with an exciting hotel room scene, an intense car chase and a coincidental finalle that ruined it all.

The rewinds, I believe there are 6, while interesting in an EXPERIMENTAL way, fail miserably, ultimately frustrating the viewer and wishing they could fast forward to the end. Yet, when they finally got to the Presidents POV, I realized, yes, the rewinding was frustrating and disjoining, but there actually was a pretty cool movie hidden here, with doubles, double-crosses and terrorism, and once the action and answers starting kicking in, I thought... If they had just told the movie without the experimental film school junk, this could have been a cool movie.

Then... of course, you throw in the coincidental ending that basically had everybody involved in the plot, and solving the plot colliding in the exact same intersection underneath an overpass. Even though, there was a crazy car chase and some guy on foot arrived at the location a good 5 minutes before guys in an ambulance, despite looking at each other back at the collisium.

We have a single episode of political terrorism told from the varying perspectives of the participants, which I found very fresh and inventive.

As we switch viewpoints, bits and pieces of the plot unfold in a creative manner. There's plenty of shoot-'em-ups, car chases, foot chases, bad guys (and politically incorrect ones, too, which was surprising), sympathy characters (a little girl in jeopardy)... the production team really covered all the bases on this one.

The difference in this thriller from the many others of the same genre is the use of telling the story from at least five different vantage points - the news reporters (Sigourney Weaver, Zo Saldana and Staff), the CIA (Dennis Quaid, Matthew Fox, et al with William Hurt as the President), a group of terrorists, an American bystander with camera (Forest Whitaker), and the viewing public.  Things are not as they initially seem and the more times the story is rerun through repetition of the incident, the more information is added.

Based on a story by Barry Levy and directed by Pete Travis the film could become tiresome in its use of repeated reruns, but given the quality of the cast and the twists and turns as the 'plot' is further elucidated makes the story more of an investigation of Intelligence forces from all involved countries and drives home the reason 'terrorism' is so terrifying.  Some of the peripheral cast members are particularly fine - Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui,  Ayelet Zurer, and Eduardo Noriega among others.

Apparently, driving and talking on a cell phone is safer than we've been led to believe. We can only hope our actual Secret Service agents are one tenth as competent (and lucky!) as Quaid. And, we can only hope that someday, our actual President is as worthy of the effort as the mythical one in this story.

3329124,2,B0012QCZ5O,"The first five minutes of Vantage Point start off strong and with a bang (no pun intended), as Sigourney Weaver and a crew of news producers sit inside a control room, ready to go live with reporters on the scene of a high-profile presidential appearance in Spain. As Weaver gets into a petty squabble with one reporter (Zoe Saldana) over the tone she chose to take in a live shot, a gunshot fires, hitting the president, and the crew scrambles to cover it. The pacing picks up significantly, as it begins to match the panic-mode of the people in the square, and then comes the one-two punch of an explosion at the base of the hotel in the center of the events. Travis chooses to introduce these events-- the ones that supposedly set up the course for the whole film-- to his audience through the limited angles this crew's cameras are able to capture, and in doing so, he doesn't allow us access to all of the information just yet. The give a little, hold a lot back approach of Vantage Point shows great potential, but unfortunately it gets old quickly and just ends up frustrating the viewers.

It's painfully obvious what is really going on from the first few minutes of Vantage Point-- in part because the majority of the plot is covered neatly in the promotional trailers but also due to the fact that the script is just not imaginative, and the plot is quite thin overall-- meaning, the stereotypical bad guys are the bad guys; there are no twists here.  Barry Levy, a former teacher who sold Vantage Point as his first screenplay, sets up a few points (such as the fact that the president used a double for his appearance and therefore didn't actually get shot) that-- if the film was allowed to play out past the course of the same two violent events over and over and over-- would actually offer interesting and unique commentary. It would have been great to see the ramifications after the realization that the public had been duped; it would have been something rooted in reality and just tongue-in-cheek enough to elicit smiles. Instead, Levy's sophomoric style keeps the audience five steps ahead of the movie at any given moment, eliminating any real reason to keep watching.

The film is full of filler, offering the same sequences from varying angles and POVs-- from Secret Service agents (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox), to a civilian with a video camera (Forest Whitaker) who just happens to be in the right place at the right time, to an up-and-coming terrorist (Said Taghmaoui, who is really too talented for this kind of typecasting).  Between the repetition, the slo-mo, the rewind sequences in between POVs, and the ungodly amount of running, there is no real plot-- just a whole lot of fast motion. The script must have been only twenty pages long and therefore would have made a really clever, really innovative short... or even a web series.

Vantage Point boasts a huge cast of name talent, none of with whom Travis seemed to know what to do.  Only Quaid and Whitaker have backstories, as simple as they may be, because Travis instead chooses to focus on convoluted action, muddying the importance of his wide net of supporting players and making the majority of them much more expendable than they perhaps should be.  There is really nothing at stake for any of them other than ""stay alive,"" and the few attempts at character connection or dimension-- most of which are given to Whitaker-- are too on the nose, as if Levy doesn't trust his audiences enough to read facial expressions, and Travis doesn't trust his actors to give the right ones. Levy tells when he should show; when Whitaker is alone, he mutters to himself ridiculously, unrealistically, and expositionally. There are actual, audible ""Oh my Gods"" spilling from these awestruck characters' mouths, and suddenly six-foot-tall, hulking men are reduced to melodramatic seventh grade girls.  It's fitting, really, that in a film about deception, corruption, and violence, the filmmakers themselves proved to be similarly paranoid control freaks, unable to allow their actors just to do their own thing.

Far too much is by ""chance"" in this film, again namely with Whitaker, who happens to stumble all wide-eyed and slack-jawed onto just about everything. Dennis Quaid, too, though, just happens to have luck and timing on his side, finding pieces of the puzzle literally one after the other just dropped at his side, which is really just typical of the arc a once-fallen hero desperate to redeem himself takes in films like Vantage Point.  Everything just comes too ""easily.""  Travis is far too distracted by manufacturing suspense to focus on the huge holes and just expects his audience to be willing to suspend their disbelief enough to join him on this ""convenient"" journey.

Vantage Point's concept is clever, and its effort is certainly admirable, but it was just too big for these green filmmakers, and unfortunately they got caught up in the flashy style and eliminated all substance.  The result, which is just laughable when it isn't intended to be a comedy, would have been much more successful if it was half its length-- and at only ninety minutes, that's certainly saying something.",1214524800,,5185,4.8386004514672685
3329135,4,B0012QCZ5O,"Critics have heaped scorn on the movie's improbabilities and on the lame politics of the movie, but I found only one real sticking point.  A suspected terrorist is running for his very life through the streets of Madrid, and a team of crack Secret Service agents in top physical condition are chasing him on foot--for blocks and blocks, through high speed traffic and up and down the sides of buildings.  And there's Forest Whitaker, bringing up the rear all right, but only slightly, a camcorder glued to his eye, not even breathing hard.  He just keeps going and going, this tubby guy, he's like the energizer beach ball.  I just didn't believe that Forest Whitaker of all people was up for the role of persistent sprinter.  Why not get Lance Armstrong or someone?  Did they hope to take advantage of Whitaker's acting talents?  He didn't take them on location, must have left them back at home in the USA.

They must have had Sigourney Weaver for fifteen minutes; she's on the screen so little I was convinced this was an elaborate coverup and that Forest Whitaker would pause, duck behind a Moorish pillar, and strip off the Forest makeup as emerge as Ripley from Alien.  She might as well have been the secret head of the terrorist ring, it would make about as much sense as what did happen.  So go with the fun and don't expect a good movie, just a broad strokes one.

The two disc special edition will reveal what anybody can see--no children were put in danger--they just used a grown woman stuntwoman, the one from DEATH PROOF I think, and dressed her in a child's white dress, and then made super scaled big cars to menace her and make her look small in comparison.",1213660800,,1838,4.553191489361702
3329136,2,B0012QCZ5O,"It is difficult to explain  how extremely nonsensical the plot of this movie is, without spoiling it. So let me simply point out some side oddities.

- A speech by the president of the USA, the mayor of Madrid, and several international dignataries is set in the boxed, sniper-friendly environment of Plaza Mayor, with hundreds of private balconies looking directly at close range into the  main stage, a logistical and security nightmare.

- American secret service personnel can boss around Spanish civilians and law enforcement alike, just by shouting ""policia"" (with the stress in the wrong syllable) and waving a gun. They can adventure way outside they retinue and chase civilians who are clearly Spanish, even engage in a high-speed chase of a Spanish police car, but no one of the abundant local police or snipers hinders them in any way.
By the way, it is possible to sustain a 10-minute car chase in the streets (and walkays) of Madrid without braking one single time, and without running over a single pedestrian.

- Spain has only one street, that ends in the country's only one highway. And all walking paths of every important character end, also, in one precise point of that highway.

- Terrorists able to devise very sophisticated plans, prove to be incredibly stupid in key, very simple parts of their execution.
Also, they can act ruthlessly and fanatically all the time, but have isolated pangs of conscience for no other reason than to suit the plot.
Finally, being almost all of them Spaniards, they will speak some Spanish among themselves to add local color, but then suddenly switch to English for no apparent reason.
Trained and motivated terrorists are so scarce, that the only guy available for the heavy duty work has to be coerced into it by unverisimilar means. And, aside from his incredible killing efficiency, he's pretty stupid otherwise.

- American secret servicemen in the middle of a national security crisis of epic proportions have time to peek around the inside of vehicles on a car crash, for no apparent reason.

The premise of the movie is repeating the same series of events from the point of view of several protagonists.
As the perspectives add up, the plot is supposed to start ""making sense"".

3329137,2,B0012QCZ5O,"I have a problem with the way this movie reached its climax.  Before the terrorists crashed the ambulance, they've already caused the death of dozens of people, indiscriminately through two bombings, and discriminately through shootings.  The woman, in particular, has shot ""Cameraman no. 2"", a co-conspirator, at close range, in cold blood, inside the ambulance (how she did that without flinching from the terrible noise, and how she never lost her hearing from such a blast inside an enclosed space, I'll never know).  So it puzzles me why in the end she had an attack of ""conscience"" and yanked the steering wheel to avoid hitting the girl, thereby rolling the ambulance and causing her own death, that of her co-terrorist (the ringleader), ending the car chase and saving the life of the president.

The concept of the movie (which is hinted at in the title) is what especially makes Vantage Point a compelling and unique film; I won't address the pattern it revolves around directly since it comes as a nice surprise, but the vantage points by which the movie progresses are very entertaining and suspenseful. Just when I thought I had figured out everything about what was going on, I was not even close. Plenty of twists, thrilling action scenes, and surprises make this movie a must-see. The acting is all tremendous as well; my only criticisms would be the tendency of the film to have parts which were incredibly unrealistic. These parts still contributed to the entertaining nature of Vantage Point, however, and so they didn't bother me much.

I normally like studmiesters like Dennis Quaid, but why oh why did he take the money for this laughable Tuesday morning?  Sigourney Weaver fans take note, her performance in this film (I have to swallow hard to even call it that) amounts to precious little more than an extended cameo.  Forest Whitaker, after seeing him in such tremendous roles as ""Last King of Scotland"" and his recurring character on the magnificent television series ""The Shield"", is a crushing disappointment as a man with a video camera who catches the preposterous proceedings on a video camera.

The gimmick of showing a political assassination from multiple characters' perspectives is intriguing, to say the least (and I am, in fact, fond enough of both red and white wine). But the tricky part, as evidenced in this outrageous mistake of a movie, is in the execution. Everytime the movie 'rewinds' to the beginning of the story to show another characters' perspective, ripples of unintentional laughter rang out loud and clear throughout the cinema.

When ""Rashomon"" showed the same event from different viewpoints, the event as described was very different to each person...the point being that reality is subjective, and as a main character remarks ""all men lie"".  ""Vantage Point"" merely shows the same event as seen by different people, the only difference being what they happened to see or be exposed to.  As such it is a presentation/storytelling technique, not a philosophical statement.

With that out of the way, I actually thought ""Vantage Point"" was better than I had expected.  Excessive car chase, over the top acting, coincidences and resolutions, but as American movies go it didn't suck.

If you'd like to see a REALLY good movie that presents the same events from different points of view, try the Korean film ""Jakarta"".  As good a screenplay as ""The Usual Suspects"" IMHO.....",1207872000,4,1025,5.13855421686747

Problem with this film is as I have pointed out its been done a million times before and is just frankly getting boring now (Imagine watching 24 with even less interest and you get the idea) We have the disgruntled secret serviceman who has previously ""took a bullet"" for the president but never quite recovered, family man American on holiday who when not filming the whole event gets on with the locals and even saves a few of them, hard sell camera crew (Changed CNN to GNN)they even seemed to pick the darkest Spanish people to be as support actors (Was that just to emphasise to the American audience that this was Spain?)

So we have unknown terrorist group whose goal is never quite explained (Though they do appear to have an Arabic name and a base in ""friendly"" Morocco.  I guess just giving us that was enough to convince us of their ""badness"") Plan an elaborate terrorist attack (If these people do have this kind of planning then God help us all!) with a multi national group with an end aim that is just as unexplained as the actual goals of the organisation itself.  Running chase, so called twist to the tale, not so subtle hints as to who the bad guys are and you pretty much have the plot (Not that there is much of one)  We are even given a moving speech from the president who refuses to retaliate to the bomb attack with a military strike because that would be ""Just what these people want"" and encourages his advisers to stick with the conference (Was this supposed to be some kind of ""What could have been"" Post 9/11) Either way it becomes a mute point when his advisers get gunned down 2 seconds later.

As its title suggests, ""Vantage Point"" is all about the unique perspective each of us brings to the events we witness.  To explore this theme, the movie employs the old ""Rashomon"" technique of telling the same story from the viewpoint of a half dozen or so characters present at the scene.  The incident in this case is the attempted assassination of the President of the United States at an anti-terrorism summit being held in Salamanca, Spain, an event at which two massive bombs are also detonated.  In Barry Levy`s screenplay, each angle of the story functions much like an individual piece in a giant jigsaw puzzle, the full picture of which comes fully clear only after each element has been successfully fitted and secured in its proper place.

""Vantage Point"" features a large cast of well-known actors, including William Hurt as the President; Dennis Quaid and Michael Fox as secret service agents; Sigourney Weaver as a TV news producer; Forest Whitaker as an American tourist; Zoe Saldana as a news reporter; and Eduardo Noriega, Edgar Ramirez and Ayelet Zurer as Spanish terrorists (the Spaniards definitely get the short end of the stick in this movie).

Despite the deliberately fragmented nature of the narrative, the main focus of the film falls on Quaid's character, an agent who less than a year earlier took a bullet for the President and who is now returning to his job an obviously shaken and high strung man.

Directed by Pete Travis, ""Vantage Point"" is a high octane political thriller that gets the job done without ever distinguishing itself overmuch.  By constantly returning to the same event (the movie sometimes feels like a somber remake of ""Groundhog Day"") and relating the story through so many eyewitnesses, the film sacrifices some of its character development for sheer narrative pyrotechnics.  Still, the storytelling is occasionally ingenious and Travis keeps the action percolating along at a fast enough clip to keep us from noting the sometimes farfetched and overwrought nature of much of what the movie is showing us (it also points up just how many nefarious things one can presumably do with an iphone these days).  There`s even a humdinger of a car chase through the beautiful streets of Salamanca that is sure to get the adrenalin pumping, even if the mind is left reeling by its overall implausibility.

""Vantage Point"" may have you rolling your eyes from time to time in confusion and disbelief, especially towards the end of the movie, but it is at least guaranteed to keep you entertained for the ninety or so minutes it takes to tell its story.",1205625600,2,2603,4.933638443935926
3329156,4,B0012QCZ5O,"The Kurosawa film ROSHOMON showed the same incident from three different perspectives and Vantage Point uses the same technique but less effectively than Kurosawa did.  However, this is an adrenalin junkies dream film. It has a very thin plot but then the entire film spans a period of less than a half hour as it shows the assassination of the President from several different perspectives.  However, these perspectives are not totally different views of the same incident as much as they are parallel events that are occuring simultaneously.  So the entire film pivots on the assassination and the subsequent events that happen immediately following.  There is an overlong car chase with all of the usual (and seemingly de rigeur) crashes and smashes.  This could have been shortened but it seemed to have been extended only to add time to the otherwise short film, which has very little plot and almost no character development.  Quaid does a good job and Forrest Whitaker is excellent as usual.  Hurt -- in the role of President manages to get the political (America is evil) subtext in which seems to infect almost all recent films.  It is made quite clear that America is prone to attacking anyone who gets in our way and the Presidential advisors are a bunch of jingoistic war mongers. But this is really only a small segment of the film and can be written off as the usual Hollywood left leaning dumbness.  The Muslims are never actually named as Muslims but there is no doubt left as to who they are.  They are astonishingly well equipped, well educated, and technically savvy.  However, in keeping with the reality of the Muslim cause their motivation seems rather vague other than murder and mayhem because they shoot and kill with reckless abandon. They clearly are only focused on their objective and willing to kill hundreds of innocent people in their hatred of America and the West, much like Hamas and Hezbollah who kill and murder innocent people simply to keep their cause on the front pages.  I lost track of the dead agents and of course the dead Spaniards were impossible to count.

However, this is a film that moves very rapidly and each vantage point leaves you hanging until the very end when all of the various perspectives merge into a conclusion.  Overall I thougt this was a fun film -- in spite of the violence -- and it certainly will get your adrenalin flowing.  I gave it four stars because it really is a very thin plot and motivations are vague to non-existent -- still it worth seeing.",1205280000,,2522,4.752293577981652
3329157,2,B0012QCZ5O,"""Vantage Point"" is a film that I really had no prior knowledge of. The only thing I knew was that it dealt with a presidential assassination and that it was told from different perspectives, but that was it. I went into the theater with an open mind and came out let down. For as much as director Pete Travis milks the gimmick of showing an assassination from different views, he never really finds a way to make it riveting, exciting, or truly entertaining.

President Ashton (William Hurt) of the United States comes to Spain to speak at a terrorism summit. As he's about to make his speech, shots ring out and the President is on the ground. The entire film then focuses on certain people in the area, who either witnessed or planned the attack. From a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) to a tourist (Forest Whitaker), each view is shown before, during, and after the assassination, which pieces the clues together about who is responsible and why they are doing it.

For a film like ""Vantage Point"" to work, it needs to be smart. Unfortunately, it's not. By throwing many paper-thin characters into the mix, the writer probably tried to confuse the viewer and make everything seem complex, when all the while it's quite simple. As the movie progressed, I would call what would happen next and who the bad guys were. Almost 95% of the time I was right and it really just made the film seem lazy.

The characters in the film were fairly one-dimensional. Luckily, a solid cast was there to make them slightly interesting. In my mind, Dennis Quaid is one of the most underrated actors in film. He seems to make every film he's in better than it should be (even ""Jaws 3-D""). Even though I would have liked more development with his character, he does a great job and makes his scenes the most interesting. Poor Matthew Fox. ""You know what's interesting about him? ...Nothing."" Oh, how right Seth Rogen was in ""Knocked Up"". The same can be said for his performance. William Hurt does a fine job with what he had to do. Not much was required. Forest Whitaker didn't do much for me, which is disappointing due to how much I enjoyed him in ""The Last King of Scotland"". He had a lot of ""off"" moments throughout the film. And, Sigourney Weaver...she picked up a paycheck.

The idea of different perspectives to show one occurrence is interesting, but it's not executed properly. First, by having so many characters, the audience cannot relate with anyone in the film. With less perspectives, there would be more time for character development, which would have benefited this film. Secondly, the director cheats the audience by not giving the true perspective of each individual. For instance, a character may have been nowhere near the assassination, but when the shots are heard, they cut away to a scene of the president being shot. If the character is not allowed to see the incident visually, neither should the audience. In a way, it's like breaking the fourth wall and it takes you out of the film. Finally, as each story progresses, one can tell that the director is leaving out certain clues that the audience is not allowed to pick up until later in the film. If a character sees something that shocks them or makes them run away, the director may hold out on what they saw until the end so that the audience will be even more shocked supposedly. Again, this doesn't work for me, because we, the audience, are supposed to see their perspectives and by not showing the catalyst of their actions, it's breaking the promise that the film gave to the viewers.

Overall, ""Vantage Point"" is a forgettable thriller. Nothing stands out to separate it from anything else being offered in film these days. It's unfortunate, because it could have been much better. If the characters had been more developed, the writing and direction tighter, the gimmick better executed, and the conclusion more satisfying, we would have had a solid film on our hands.",1205020800,2,3946,4.704775687409551
3329158,3,B0012QCZ5O,"Telling a story (or stories) from multiple viewpoints has been done many times. You remember Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or probably you have seen some of Tarantino's films that employ the device quite effectively or Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing."" But I'm afraid in ""Vantage Point"" things went too far because it includes as many as eight characters' perspectives, or stories, to tell.

You think it's repetitious? It is, but be patient as I explain it later. Anyway, the story of ""Vantage Point"" centers on the assassination of President of the United States (William Hurt) visiting Spain for international anti-terrorism conference. The cast includes Dennis Quaid, Mathew Fox, Forest Whitaker, Bruce McGill, Edgar Ramirez, Sad Taghmaoui, Ayelet Zurer, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver.

After you witness the assassination scene from one character's viewpoint (from American traveler, secret agent, and so on), the camera suddenly freezes and starts to rewind, going back in time to the point where the film just began. Frankly this is s bit annoying to most viewers (including me), so every time the film starts rewinding, you may hear someone behind you groan in theater. Well, I think I did groan once or more.

Each new take of the story shows the events from another perspective, but few of them really surprise us, not knowing how to illuminate the incidents in a truly refreshing fashion. The film only slowly adds new keys to the story - hidden identities and motives, etc. - but these truths are not particular interesting, and if you are fans of action films, I believe you can predict most of the twists and turns of the convoluting plot.

Fortunately the latter half of the film gets faster and better with car chases and actions that become more and more hectic as the film goes on.

Yet the core story is interesting.  The action sequences and great camera work make this a movie worth watching.  Good acting and a strong finish help to overcome some loose ends and production errors.

The President of the United States (William Hurt), or POTUS as referred to by the secret service, is the target of a group of terrorists whose objectives are never revealed to us.  While overseas to attend an anti-terrorism summit in Spain, he is shot.  Or is he?

Dennis Quaid and Mathew Fox (of ""Lost"" fame&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete First Season</a>) play secret service agents there to protect the President.  After multiple attacks occur after the president is shot, they scramble to try to respond and find the shooter.  It is very difficult to tell which attacks are meant to kill and which are meant to divert attention away from the villains.

Quaid takes advantage of Forest Whitaker's camcorder film and the media's tapes to piece together the story.  As each of the characters is swung into action, we get to see their individual struggles to cope with chaos and how their stories are interconnected.

Perhaps in an homage to ""24,"" after each character's scene finishes it 'rewinds' to the beginning to give us the next character's 'vantage point.' This gets old fast.  After a while, these vantage points seem to disintegrate into one another and overlap more and more.  In fact, this is one story where the effect seems to have taken away from the story.

The action sequences are very strong, and even though there's a lot of hand held camera work they get enough steady shots to make the chase scenes watchable.  Most notable is a car chase scene that is bound to draw comparisons to Ronin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronin/dp/6305263248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronin</a>, The Bourne Identity&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity-Widescreen-Extended-Edition/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>, The Italian Job&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Italian-Job-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000B1OFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and other recent car chase movies.  Putting together a sequence like that is very difficult, and I can't wait for the DVD to see how they did it.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good car chase.

The pacing of the movie is good and especially improves once we get to the last few vantage points.  The score is excellent and blends well with the action sequences.  We are purposely left without reasons why this group is after the president.

There are some technical things that are off in the movie.  Anybody who has ever been to Spain will get that uneasy feeling.  Once you see the Mexican extras and hear them speak a very Central American Spanish it becomes clear they are in Mexico, not Spain.  They try to use a few Spanish actors, but it's not enough to feel like Spain.

Some parts of the dialogue seem overly preachy.  Still, this movie does effectively portray how difficult security planning is in a world where government security tactics are public knowledge.  The story probably would have been more profound and meaningful with a traditional plot-line, which it turns into at the end anyway.

This movie is worth watching and improves a lot towards the end.  You just have to get past several very annoying rewind sequences and plenty of early repetition.

A bomb goes off right under your nose with loads of people lying dead and wounded but our various heroes barely have a scratch except for their tattered clothes! The Secret Service is totally inept except for one guy with shaky hands! I think you get the picture! But the best scene is one of the last.

But just moments earlier taking out a score of Secret Service agents was a walk in the park!

 I did find the 'Groundhog Day' technique of repeating the same day over, and over again, but from  different perspectives, to be a very interesting approach to story telling.

3329162,4,B0012QCZ5O,"US President Ashton (Hurt) is set to attend an anti-terrorist conference in Salmanca, Spain. Agent Thomas Barnes (Quaid) is back on duty after being shot defending the President from an attempted assassination.

Howard Lewis (Whitaker) is on vacation in Spain and filming the conference for his family back home.  He sees movement in a window behind the President and catches the assassin on tape.

The rest of the film is from 8 separate vantage points and tells the tale of the attempted assassination and kidnapping of the US President by terrorists. The action's fast and the scene 'rewinds' each time for a new 'vantage point.'

Yes, the concept's been done before, but I have to get a nod to a stellar cast.  Hurt, Quaid, Whitaker all had me lost in their personal stories and rooting for the 'good guys.'

WARNING:  Rewinds may be a problem for folks with vertigo, migraines or seizures.  I have vertigo and offer this warning to others.  Note--for some reason, this film panned out well enough that I wasn't dizzy or nauseated afterwards. IMHO, that's a job well done for the cinematographer.",1204329600,11,1100,4.870967741935484
3329163,5,B0012QCZ5O,"I thought this movie was excellent.  It did what so few movies can do: keep me engaged.  From the very first few minutes to the very end, the action was non-stop.  Although I'm female, I don't mind energy-intense action movies like this one.  ""Vantage Point"" was fast paced, intelligent, suspenseful, and at the same time emotional and human. Yes, a LOT depended on coincidence, but overall, it was very enjoyable.  The whole ""different points of view"" concept was interesting and made for great storytelling (I like seeing films in which total strangers end up totally intertwined), although it soon began to get repetitive, the movie's only flaw in my opinion.  It also required the viewer to pay close attention, because there were dozens of little details that could have been easily missed.  And there was so much to see: dopplegangers, explosions, accidents, assassination...I was very entertained throughout.  Forrest Whittaker showed his softer side, Dennis Quaid drove the hell out of a little compact car, the president stood up for himself and found a clever way to kick butt, and LOTS of hot male actors!  I plan to get this just as soon as it goes to DVD...and I might try to get a copy of it even before then.",1204243200,,1223,4.813397129186603
3329164,3,B0012QCZ5O,"I suppose there's nothing actively offensive or bad about VANTAGE POINT, but it has very little to recommend it in the way of freshness or genuine thrills.

It tells the story of a terrorist attack in Salamanca, Spain, where the president is about to give a speech announcing a major new anti-terror initiative.  He is shot and the historic square where he was standing is subjected to a huge bomb blast as well.

I feel okay telling you this, because that's all revealed in the first few minutes of the movie. We see it all play out through the eyes of the TV journalists who are covering the event.  Because we haven't seen all the details of the attack before, we can enjoy a little thrill of the unexpected and the blood certainly gets racing during these opening scenes.  Then, the film goes back about 20 minutes to show the same events from the point of view of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid), just returning to active duty a year after taking a bullet for the President.  Then it goes back AGAIN and shows everything from various other points of view.  Each retelling has slightly different information, of course, and each goes a little past the other, so that we see a little more of the story unfold.

Frankly, though, this device gets a little tiresome (and evoked a few sniggers from the audience as we see it going back YET AGAIN to the beginning).  It seems to want to lend some sort of importance to the film, but truly, the same story could have been told in a more traditional manner and perhaps been even more exciting.  The first time we see the president take a bullet, it's pretty unnerving. The fifth time we see it...ho hum.

Eventually, the film moves forward towards a resolution, mostly involving Quaid discovering a major character is not who he/she appears and then chasing that person throughout the old Spanish city for a really long time in a really small car.  (Good thing it doesn't have airbags or he would have been out of the chase pretty early on!).

The chase is reminiscent of the one in BOURNE IDENTITY and the location in Salamanca looks a lot like many of the locales in BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  The whole film feels derivative.  Other than its time-hopping gimic...there isn't much plot.  In fact, when it's all over, I realised that the entire narrative probably covered less than 40 minutes of time.  Also, the conclusion relies too much on the coincidence of EVERYONE arriving at the same location at the same time.

There's a visceral, jumpy quality to much of the action, and there's no doubt the car chase is done well.  It has moments of excitement.  But there's is simply too little meat on the bones of this film for it have any hope of rising above the mediocre.

Quaid, William Hurt (as the President), Matthew Fox as Quaid's co-hort and other well known character actors are all quite okay.  Forest Whitaker, as a tourist with a knack for videotaping the exact right things, is lost in a poorly written, thankless role...and he does little to make it more tolerable.  Sigourney Weaver, as the TV producer, spends the whole movie in the remote broadcast truck, and you quickly realise that there is absolutely no reason for an actor of her stature to be in this film.  She is given nothing interesting to do...but I assume got a decent paycheck for perhaps a weeks worth of work.

The movie is a 90 minute diversion, and certainly it is technically skillful.  I just don't think it will linger in the memory for very long after you leave the theater.",1203724800,,3506,4.596463022508039

I thought it was well done and the acting was good, but it was one of those movies that I never know what is going on!  I thought the first part went on forever (boring) and the rest of it was a bunch of car chases and people shooting one another.  I had no idea what was going on.  Personally I would give it one star, because I didn't like it, but I do give credit to the fact that it was well done, had good acting, and my boyfriend thinks it is a great movie.",1514851200,,522,3.850467289719626

VIDEO:  2.40:1  Color  480p  MPEG-2 (4.7 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this transfer exhibits very-good to frequently excellent picture quality. This film's gorgeous cinematography is presented surprisingly well in this DVD transfer  which features richly saturated colors, good contrast and very-good shadow detail. In addition, the night scenes and dark indoor scenes (of which, there are many) are mostly un-crushed and free of artifacts. Also, relatively fine detail (for a DVD) is evident in the brighter scenes and in many of the close-ups of actor's faces and their clothing. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations to detract from the image. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has very good picture quality, and should satisfy the majority of viewers who have good scalers in their televisions or their audio/video processors.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 5.1 (448 Kbps)

  The audio quality presented by the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on this disc is very good! Dialog was clear and natural sounding, and is well-placed. The surround channels were fairly active and very directional  with ambient sounds being used to effectively convey the feel of the on-screen environments. Plus, there are plenty of occasions where deep, energetic bass is evident. This soundtrack, while NOT a modern lossless high-definition soundtrack, is still an excellent 5.1 soundtrack  which should satisfy all but the vast majority of listeners.
