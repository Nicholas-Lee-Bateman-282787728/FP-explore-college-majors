For the individual user (rather than the coach) If you're looking for a plyometric workout to start training, this is not the video for you. If you're already comfortable making your own workouts and are looking to add some plyometric drills this is worth a watch.",1461888000,,458,4.7974683544303796
8305320,2,B001GGGVQ4,"I bought this dvd to give my kids a plyo workout for strength training in their off season. This is a great addition to this guy's dissertation. However, it's a video for other trainers. Not athletes. There are good tips, but no suggested or actual workouts. It's certainly not worth the price.",1443398400,,294,4.673076923076923
