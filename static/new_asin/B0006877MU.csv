8536075,2,B0006877MU,"When reading the sales pitch for this DVD, one would expect ""Magic."" However, all you get is two guys juggling the ball without any ""spunk."" The first routine shows a gentleman juggling the ball doing three different ways and he keeps doing the same thing for about 20 minutes. Nothing fancy, simply keeping the ball from touching the ground. The second guy has one nice trick in which he takes his shirt off and the put it back on while keeping the ball on the back of his neck. The rest, is just kids 'attempting' stuff. There is no instruction whatsoever. I recommed against it. Hope this helps.",1169769600,6,598,4.546296296296297
