8286670,5,B001CCIS8G,"Stunningly funny and heart-warming. Jane is fabulous as sh is dying to meet Paul Newman. It marks one of my most favorite episodes of this entire series! Yet these two work seamlessly together, so one picks up where the other leaves off. It's also interesting to see the kids growing up and coming into their own. They even open a few of the episodes!

If you haven't seen this series--I cannot recommend it enough.  Enjoy, relax! Enjoy relax!",1428278400,,443,4.666666666666667

8286672,5,B001CCIS8G,"It's not Shakespeare, it's not Noel Coward or Arthur Miller--but it has a special place in my heart.  I remember when that show was on and it really did reflect a new kind of family.  It was warm, loving and funny then with a terrific cast and it still is.

My 12 year old daughter and I have watched all the Kate and Allie's and she loves them as much as I did.  The 80's are just another era in the history book for her, but we've had lots of discussions generated by the show.  We've discussed Reagan, music, hairstyles, clothing and many other things. My husband and I laugh at an age (not so long ago) when you collected cassette tapes and saved quarters for pay phones.

We love season 5 because Allie finds Bob!  We love the catering, odd job business that Kate and Allie begin as well.  If you enjoy 80's sitcoms you have to find room on your shelve for Kate and Allie, it's surely one of the best.  But do start at season 1 as it's a great show to watch in order.  The characters grow and change and while season 5 may be our favorite, the whole series is terrific.",1320710400,3,1074,4.169902912621359
