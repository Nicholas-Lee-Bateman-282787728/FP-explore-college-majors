2246260,4,B0007WFUGU,"I gotta say...everyone is saying the most obvious thing:  Lack of most of the commentaries.  However, I gotta remind everyone that the picture quality of these DVDs are excellent!  Much better than their region-free UK brethren.  I am surprised that they did not release them in a more normal fasion...ie: the UK series style (of around 13 episodes or the US season style of Season 1 in a boxed set then Season 2...etc.

However, we DO get a better buy this way.  $50 US is an excellent price.  I, like a previous reviewer, found them at Best Buy...

They DO include the excellent feature of the ""Teaser"" at the end of the episodes.  Very much UK!  (As the commentators point out:  ""It is because the eposidoes ran short on time!"")

A&E, talkbackThames, THAMES, FreemantleMeedia, NewVideo -- listen up:  INCLUDE ALL COMMENTARIES IN THE FUTURE!  We deserve it and there is no downside for you!

2246261,4,B0007WFUGU,"Finally, a US-formatted release of ""The Tomorrow People."" For those of us who tuned in to ""Nickleodeon"" on weekday afternoons during the 1980s, this is a major blast to our Gen-X retro past. Yeah, the special effects were cheesy and the acting amaturish, but stories were powerful and spoke to those of us who felt ""different."" For those who value style over substance in a sci-fi series, compare the 40-odd year run of ""Doctor Who"" to the 27-year run of the Roddenberry ""Trek"" franchise. Which one is still currently being produced? Oh, right. ""Who.""

The episodes in this set are presented in their original 30-minute ""serial"" format, with opening and closing credits in between each episode. While this makes for disjointed viewing of the entire story and can be annoying to view the ""flashback"" sequences from the previous episode, the format keeps the entire set true to the original series. The lack of original series artwork on the box makes it hard to spot on the shelf; for reasons unknown, A&E elected to go with ""original"" artwork on the box and the DVD cases.

Here's to A&E for finally bringing this series to DVD on our shores. Keep 'em coming.",1118966400,,1159,4.79
2246262,5,B0007WFUGU,"Finally the great 1970s British Sci-Fi show of a group of kids who are the next stage of human evolution is released in NTSC (it had been released previously in the UK in  all-region DVDs but in PAL format). The show is a personal all-time favorite, not only because these ""Tomorrow persons"" have special powers (telepathy, telekinesis, and teleportation) but also because, being more evolved, they have also become non-violent and unable to kill (known as the Prime Barrier). The show was way ahead of its time in story content; and the non-violent and creative solutions with which this group of kids save the world provide a wonderful role-model for children and adults everywhere.

Sure, the special effects, costumes and sets are very cheesy, but the content and stories more than make up for that.

And the opening credits and music are incredibly original and appealing.

My complaint about the US release is that the DVD package doesn't include any true images, logos or fonts from the show (why?), and that the hilarious commentaries found in the UK release are not included (perhaps due to the controversial comments by the cast members), except for that of the first story (Slaves of Jedikiah).

PS Star Wars fans: look out for David Prowse, a.k.a. Darth Vader, playing Copin in the second story: The Medusa Strain.",1118793600,,1326,4.928251121076233
2246263,4,B0007WFUGU,"For the uninitiated: The Tomorrow People was a classic science fiction show that originally aired on ITV in the UK back in the 70's. It centers around a group of young people (teenagers and 20somethings) who represent the next stage of human evolution. They have various telepathic powers, which they use to battle various sorts of evil throughout the course of the show.

Now, you'll hear reports about the bad acting (especially during the first series, the actor playing Kenny in particular, was awful, and in fact never really did much acting after he left the show) and the dodgy special effects. But I think the creativity and intentions of the show ring through clearly and outweigh the downside.

I think anyone who likes stuff like Doctor Who would love this show, as I've always thought it was fantastic. My only complaint is that they left off most of the audio commentaries that appear on the region 0 DVD's that were released in the UK. These commentaries, which feature the show's stars Nicholas Young and Peter Vaughan-Clarke are incredibly hilarious and frequently quite ribald (the latter might be why only The Slaves Of Jedikiah was used on the American release). If you don't mind paying a little extra money, and your DVD player can play PAL discs, I'd recommend popping over to Amazon UK and buying the first series boxsets.",1118534400,3,1345,4.843478260869565
2246264,3,B0007WFUGU,"I'd never actually seen this version of ""The Tomorrow People"", but I was a huge fan of the remake which ran on Nickelodeon back in the mid 90's.  I decided to give this a chance on a whim, and I was a little dissapointed.  The acting is beyond bad.  The special effects are cheesy.  If I was to compare it to the remake, I'd have to say I liked the remake much better.  However, the writing isn't terrible.  There's some real creativity going on here.  If you can get past the cheesiness it's worth a watch.",1117756800,,507,4.21875
2246265,5,B0007WFUGU,"I used to watch THE TOMORROW PEOPLE when it ran on New Jersey Network (a public access station) on Saturday evenings. This is an intriguing show, kind of like ""X-Men"" for the DOCTOR WHO crowd. The psychedelic opening and theme song stuck with me for the next decade. So imagine my shock when I found that THE TOMORROW PEOPLE on DVD today at Best Buy while I was looking for THE STRANGE VICE OF MS. WARDH and THE CASE OF THE SCORPION'S TAIL! I couldn't resist, even though it set me back about $52!

The first two seasons of this fine series are collected here in Set 1. From ""The Slaves of Jedikiah,"" which introduces Stephen to the group of powerful children that try to save the world, to ""The Doomsday Men,"" where the kids try to prevent Armageddon, THE TOMORROW PEOPLE is as much fun as you remember whether you caught it during its first run or saw the reruns on Nickelodeon (which revived it for a time in the early 1990's) or public access (like me). So ""jaunt"" your way to your video retailer and get this set!",1117670400,,1018,4.3578947368421055
2246266,4,B0007WFUGU,"If you were a fan of The Tomorow People from back in the days when it was shown on Nickelodeon, there is a lot to like about this four disc set.  Granted, by today's standards the sets look cheap, the special effects look cheesey,  some of the acting  is poor (Kenny, anyone?) but The Tomorrow People is still a lot of fun, and at times can be just as enjoyable as vintage Dr. Who (which this very much resembles). If you liked it then, you'll like it now.  But  I have one problem with this set, and it is a big one.  When the series was released on  DVD in the UK, a cast commentary was included on every episode and  those in the know have been commenting on how fun and entertaining these commentaries are.  I purchased a few of the R2 discs myself and can attest to the fact that the commentary tracks alone are worth the cost of the DVDs.  Unfortunately, for some reason the folks at A&E Home Video have opted to include only the commentary on Slaves of Jedikiah,  the series one opener, and have not included them on any of the other stories.  A poor decision,  and one that prevents me from giving this my whole-hearted recommendation.  In fact, if you are able to play them, I suggest looking into  getting the UK editions which are also much more attractively packaged, instead of the R1 releases.

Summing up:  Worthwhile stuff,  but packaged by dunderheads.",1117497600,3,1369,4.408
2246267,4,B0007WFUGU,"When Tomorrow People came to Nickelodean in the 1980's I fell in love with the characters and stories then. Granted some of it is simplistic in ways, especially compared to today's CGI and complex story lines that are being produced in some Science Fiction. But in terms of enjoyment, this was still up there. I will enjoy buying this DVD set as soon as it comes out and highly recommend it for those who liked and still enjoy watching Doctor Who One through Three.

The thing is that we now live in a very high qualified age of visual standards and Tomorrow People seem to be very very nave in many ways.

Tomorrow People however handled the idea of evolved humans but with more intelectual powers (instead of the mutant ones now en bogue in movie industry).

2246278,5,B0007WFUGU,"I loved watching TP again. Hard to explain the appeal; you will see some of the worst acting, worst sets, worst effects, bad telecine and dodgy chromo-key on display anywhere in the 1970s. And yet...sometimes it looks fantastic, the stories are often original and engaging and the good acting performances definitely outweigh the bad. Most indefineably of all it has charm. Although there are campy moments (which can be enjoyed as such) it is the stories and the characters that hold the attention.

I am intrigued by the removal of the commentaries. The UK boxes describe these as the funniest commentaries on DVD. Quite a claim but I think I might just agree. They are hilariously bitchy and embittered (time was not terribly kind to the TP stars after the show finished, well at least as far as their acting careers went). The comments on other actors and the production team are unbelievably cruel (but hysterically funny); and yes, ribald is the word. They are also very non-PC. At one stage you hear the sound of beer cans being opened (which might explain much) and not infrequently someone says ""that will be edited out."" The worst of the expletives are bleeped out but it seems that's about as far as the editing went. Was it all a terrible mistake?",1194134400,6,1259,4.748858447488584
2246279,4,B0007WFUGU,"I've often wondered about this TV show and what happened to it. I first saw it just a couple of weeks ago at Tower Records and could not beleive what I saw. My G/F is also into sci-fi and I told her about this show a few times. I ordered the set and just watched the first DVD. I was expecting to be disappointed by the shows special effects with this being the era of CGI and special effects having come SO far in the 30 years since this show was first on.

I warned her that it would probably appear cheesy and about it's low budget nature. While some things were almost laughable compared to today, overall it was better then I was expecting. The stories were more complicated then I remember, the stories do tend to suck you in and make you care about what happens to the characters. It was pretty cool about the things that Tim can do, with him being a biological computer, I was surprised that they even understood about that back then, the way that he can create food, tap into hospital and other computer before the advent of the internet and much more.

Some of the acting is worse then I remember, you can tell that some of the lines are spoken too fast, some direction needs work and such, but again, for a kids show in the early to mid 70's, it was fairly well done. I'm Glad that I bought this first set and will probably get the second set too. My G/F also enjoyed it and thought that it was pretty cool too.

My being into the mind, Qigong, Chinese Gung-fu, meditation and internal force energy, science, astronomy and sci-fi in general, this show always held a special place with me. As a child that grew up being bothered and picked on, this show was a huge escape for me and helped me to understand many things and inspire me in my training and in overcoming myself.

It's in this light that I continue to watch the show. Just as Lucas gave us a solid foundation of Spirituality and morality with Star Wars, this show also did the same thing in a different way. As long as you keep in mind that the special effects and some of the acting is not what you would expect today and if you enjoyed it when you were younger, I'm sure that you'll also enjoy seeing this great sci-fi series again as I myself do.",1156636800,6,2221,4.243498817966903
2246281,5,B0007WFUGU,"I think that this series, if you liked it when you were younger, isn't that bad still. I don't ""regret buying it"" as some do.

First, it might not stand up to today's TV, but then again most TV today doesn't stand up to what came out in the 80's anyway.

I do not, not for a second, regret getting this. I recall watching it on Nickelodeon. It was after I found Tom Baker's Doctor Who, but before I really got *INTO* British Sci-Fi. This series broke the mold that the British had more to offer than Doctor Who.

OK, the effects aren't stellar. Maybe the writing needs more. But it had something else people forget: atmosphere. As Jeremy Bentham wrote: 'it's all about putting aside reality for 30 minutes and immersing yourself in the story' (I paraphrased that a bit). Don't expect it to be Citizen Kane!! Put your expectations to one side and just remember it as a series trying to find it's feet and get a new concept out. Watch it for the joy of your youth, or the joy of finding something new. For those of you who regretted it, there is always eBay.",1141776000,11,1056,4.3232323232323235
2246282,3,B0007WFUGU,"I have been a long time fan of British Sci-fi. I love Doctor Who and Blake's 7 , and Red Dwarf, e.t.c. So I was surprised when I came across the Tomorrow People. Up until a year or so ago, I had never heard of the series. So I was excited about re-discovering a great sci-fi series, which Tomorrow People certainly was. However, the show is defenitly aimed for small children. While the stories are solid sci-fi, the delivery is handled with kid gloves. Unlike Dr. Who or Blake's 7, the violence is extremely scaled down with no fatal consequences. The acting is pretty horrid as well. Also with the exception of Steven and John, the rest of the cast are very annoying and whinney, especially Carol. The shows do eventually get better, I can only take them in small doses.",1136505600,2,772,4.4822695035460995
2246283,1,B0007WFUGU,"This show hasn't stood up well to the test of time.  If you've never seen it, save yourself disappointment.  If you loved it when you were younger, rent it.

I am one of those who loved it when I was younger.  I had completely forgotten about the show and when I saw it on DVD I rushed to buy the first set.  Now having watched it, I regret buying it.

Now I can't help noticing things I didn't notice when I was younger.  The bad acting, writing, editing, props, and special effects.  Just about everything.  Of course a show this old has to be judged by the standard of its day.  By that standard it is so-so.  Judged by today's standards it's quite bad.  Although it's a bit disillusioning to see how bad the show is considering how much I loved it when I was younger, I don't regret having watched it.  I can't imagine ever wanting to watch it again though.  That's why I recommend renting it if you can.  Get your nostalgia fix and when you're done I think you'll agree that it's not nearly worth the price to own it.

The first DVD in the set has a complete story arc.  Rent that one and you'll have all you need to judge for yourself whether the purchase of the set is justified.  I think you'll be glad you saved your money.",1134777600,6,1232,4.1923076923076925
2246284,3,B0007WFUGU,"Finally Thames Television's The Tomorrow People, the science fiction series that upon airing on NICK (belatedly in the early 80's), immediately hooked American audiences having discovered Tom Baker's Dr. Who. Like the BBC's popular sci-fi series The Tomorrow People followed a similar cliffhanger formula the show's first two seasons make their dvd debut in this four-disc set. The effects are quite dated but the premise remains sound: Average teen Stephen Jameson (Peter Vaughn-Clarke) learns he isn't so average when he meets the Tomorrow People"" other teen with the powers he shares. The pilot ""Slaves of Jedikiah"" features Stephen's ""breakout"" or the extreme panic and shock that ""Tomorrow People"" undergo when becoming aware of the new powers, like hear others thoughts through telepathic contact (the other more experienced teens feel that transmitting the panicked teens name over and over into his head will have a claming effect as they attempt to aid Stephen's transition into the next stage of human evolution. The Tomorrow People are Homo superiors and as such are part of the galactic community, which is nurturing the Earth's first telepaths through a policy of strict non-interference. The teens travel by teleportation or jaunting, living with a super space computer in an underground hideout (because the normal Homo Sapiens, or an the TPs affectionately call them ""SAPS,"" would fear or destroy them). They are unable to kill, even to defend themselves, this limitation make the series more family accessible, for the teens must use their brains to figure out non-violent solutions to their conflicts, sometimes pointlessly over elaborate, but non-violent none-the-less. They search the Earth (and time and space) to aid others emerging in this next step in human evolution.

However, the dvd's are still very much worth the money. The series was never an answer to Dr. Who but was always just as good. The special effects were very good considering the budget restraints. The show itself is a sci-fi drama for children that appeals to adults as well. Roger Price was big on resolving issues using peaceful means. This philosophy showed in many of the episodes. Even in The blue and The Green, when the solution screams violence, John (the leader of the Tomorrow People) finds a peaceful solution that does not require violence.  The acting I felt was very good over all. Elizabeth Adair and Nicholas Young are very good at portraying whatever emotion was needed at the moment. In one scene, they do a fight that was very realistic. I love to watch this show while working out on the treadmill. The Tomorrow People really keep me entertained.

The dvd is not CC, however those who are hearing impaired fans of the Tomorrow People still can buy the dvds and get some enjoyment.

The show holds up extremely well. Laughable FX granted, but the story and actors willing to committ really holds your interest. While the first season was good, especially with introducing Stephen, the show really hits its stride with Season 2, when Elizabeth shows up. John is in it for the long haul (as is TIM), while future storylines include mind-controlling fingerpaintings, the revelation that Hitler was a shape-shifting alien and is back on Earth, and the near sacrifice of an asian telepath.
