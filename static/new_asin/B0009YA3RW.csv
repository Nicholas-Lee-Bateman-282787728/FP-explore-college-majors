2338145,3,B0009YA3RW,"the film starts off okay but even that has the 'voice' exposition for a couple of mins.

seems a typical 'saturday morning film', nothing deep here and you have your ususal black hat bad guy's.the animation is okay not pixar quality but good enough to tell the story, there's quite a few of these story types closest ones would be 'final fantasy the spirits within' and 'kaena the prophecy' both of which are better films in my opinion...still this one's okay the ending is a letdown really..they just went for the 'transformers ending' which was cheap and tacky...another film in a similar vein and budget was the of Dragons - Fire And Ice which had better storyline and animation.

overall it's an okay film, nothing amazing children may like it though i personally think they could have done much more with the story and not opt for the typical/easy story mechanics they used.

When ARK Deserves to have at Least 15 Spots available for rent!! I had Never even Heard of this movie Before I saw it for rent, But I Read the box Front and Back and the Story and CGI Animation Looked Good, So I figued I'd give it a try. The Action and CGI Animation are truly Breathtaking! I was Completely blown away, It totally Superseded ALL My expections! My wife Who Doesnt Really Care for Anime, Couldn't Pull herself off the Couch while it was on!! So much So thAt I am going to buy me a copy for my Collection, that's what i'm doing on amazon now!

Pretty good stuff, but it's a film of paradoxes and you can always tell which parts the creators were most interested it. Lemme break it down:

Story: Lots'a cool ideas, some work, some seem to fizzle out. The assassination of the empress, for example -- Didn't matter. Nothing in the story really changed when it happened. The assistant-guy's unrequited love for the lead scientist, Prel's and Jallak's relationship, the slave unrest, how and when that bird-thing passed from the old man to Amarinth... It's all stuff that could add up to a great story, but somehow it all becomes scenery, touched on but never explored. The main plotline is solid, but nothing special because of this -- The magic in a story comes from the little details.

Character Design: Some great designs here, some less than great. Baramanda's one freaky-lookin' guy; a pretty subtle design; his face looks like he's an old man in a young man's skin, and whether that was intentional or not it makes it all the better when it's revealed what he's become. His two henchmen are pretty imposing too. But the heroine, Amarinth? Average porcelain anime girl in an average blue-and-red spandex outfit. The hero? Average anime guy.

Modeling: Some of the models, the weapons especially, were pretty generic and simplistic. Others, the two city-mechs namely, are freakin' gold. Like with the concept artists it's pretty clear what the modelers had fun with, and what they made just because they had to.

Rigging: No complaints. I did see the textures swimming on the ammo belts a bit, but that's all.

Animation: Same as the rest; great in places, less than stellar in others. For example in the scene where Baramanda's torturing the prisoners with the bugs his lip-synching is perfect, but in other places the mouths move, but there's no real rhyme or reason to why. Poses don't get enough exaggeration, actions are mistimed, walk cycles and movements seem weightless... But it's still fairly decent stuff, though it's not often anything special. It's only really amazing when the animators are really interested in the shot, and you can always tell when that happens.

In a nutshell, I'd say it's a movie worth renting at least. It does have an interesting story, and so many elements with great potential even if it's underused a little too often. It's not the best CG film I've seen, but it's a step above most independent 3d films and definitely an intriguing one that I won't be trading in at Gamestop anytime soon.

Plus big freaking robots. BIG freaking robots.

2338149,5,B0009YA3RW,"ARC is probably one of the best animated movies I've ever seen - the story, the impeccable, original animation - and I believe that's James Woods doing the lead voice - a complete triumph that took me by surprise and is now the movie I show to anyone who ever comes over.  One of the very best - on the same level as AKIRA and GHOST IN THE MACHINE.  It's that good.",1137628800,,365,4.055555555555555
2338150,5,B0009YA3RW,"I saw it a few weeks ago on movieplex and I was very impressed by what I saw. I missed probably the first half hour of it, I was just flippin through the channels when suddenly this incredible looking movie caught my eye! This movie has incredible computer generated graphics, and a very interesting Sci Fi story. There is also lots of action scenes. I also think the voice acting was preatty good too. I think that you have to be a fan of some of the things that I mensioned above to be able to sit through this movie. That's why I recommend that you rent before you buy because some people like my dad for example could never understand why I like this stuff.",1124236800,5,661,4.253968253968254
2338151,4,B0009YA3RW,"With animation just below that of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, this movie looks simply beautiful.  The story is decent with some flaws, but nothing major or anything detracts from the experience.  The creators of the movie have been in the business for over 20 years, making over 200 a year with many for Warner Brothers and Disney.  I look forward to owning this on DVD.",1122595200,6,377,4.681818181818182

But by the end you leave so many poeple who deserved to stay alive behind that the end somehow felt like a let down.
