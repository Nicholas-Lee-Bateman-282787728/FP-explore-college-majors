2619994,5,B000GW8OA0,"AWESOME movie.  After visiting Gettysburg this past summer, it was very interesting to learn even more details about this terrible battle.  Would highly recommend it.",1199577600,4,166,5.6
2619995,5,B000GW8OA0,Classic and amazing movies that you shouldn't go without seeing! Combining these two DVD's was an amazing idea! Arrived extremely fast!,1198540800,3,135,5.476190476190476
2619996,4,B000GW8OA0,This is a great duo and I would recommend to anyone who is interested in anything Civil War.,1195344000,,92,4.166666666666667
2619997,5,B000GW8OA0,"I have seen just about every Civil war movie ever made. I have read extensivly on the subject.

Gettysburg was very good however a few things were changed to make it more dramatic. But please understand this is still a very good movie.

However God and generals was superb. While Martin Sheen plays Robert E Lee in Gettysburg doing a decent job, It is Robert Duval who plays the same in Gods and generals that steals the show. He was fantastic. Alot of actors who played in Gettysburg play the same men in Gods and generals.
Such as Jeff Daniels who plays Col Chamberlain in both movies, doing a great job i might add.

While Gettysburg is about just that Gettysburg...The 3 day battle that might have turned the war towards the north. It was a crushing defeat for the south. However the war still wages on for 2 years after Gettysburg.

God and generals however covers the Civil war up to Gettysburg..

Do yourself a favor and get these two movies...You will throughly enjoy them.",1184284800,6,981,4.551136363636363
2619998,3,B000GW8OA0,"While they are both very accurate and both likely a civil war enthusiast's dream, the former, ""Gettysburg"" is actually a terrific movie, paced and written and acted quite well (except for some rather bad adding by extras...its forgivable).  Gettysburg is a must for everyone.  It is important US history of obe of our country's defining battles, told in a very convincing human manner.

The second movie included ""Gods and Generals"" comes from the same director, Ron Maxwell, off the novel written by ""The Killer Angels"" (Made into Gettysburg) son, Jeff Sharra.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come close to what was shown possible in Gettysburg.  In many instances, the movie is rendered almost unwatchable.  While realistic almost to a fault, Maxwell sacrifices competent movie making for the sake of the hard core civil war enthusiasts.  While the written word of the day was far more floaty and discriptive than today's writing by the masses, soldiers of day still had slang, and its hard to believe a second of the lofty impromtu speeches given by soldiers in the confusing of battle.  This movie tends of be more a series of recorded speeches than providing any kind of vehicle to tell such an important story to the masses.  The movie tanked at the box office and rightfully so...its an awful movie.  And its a shame.  Ted Turner (who financed both movies) subsequently lost faith in Ron Maxwell as a movie maker and sold off the rights to ""The Last Full Measure"" (the third book in the trilogy) for pennies on the dollar.  Here's hoping a competent movie maker attempts the 3rd installment or Maxwell can make a return to his roots.",1180310400,9,1643,4.870503597122302
2619999,5,B000GW8OA0,"These two films are the real thing, civil war movies at their best, in addition to great drama and acting taking ones' breath away.  They cover the first three years of the Civil war including the battles of Bull Run, Fredricksberg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg(Antietem is not included).

Gods and Generals follows the stories of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin and Stonewall Jackson but is mostly the story of Stonewall Jackson and his leadership and religious beleifs.  This is a wonderful folm shot on location with many reenactors and brilliant acting, a fair depiction of both sides and real poetry in the language.

Gettysburg covers the three day battle that is seen as deciding the war and concentrates on Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet and Joshua L. Chamberlin and his main company.  A brilliant film full of tragedy and love.

2620000,5,B000GW8OA0,"I loved this series.  As a Civil War reenactor, and a history/education major, I have to say that these movies are awesome.  I would also reccomend The Last Full Measure.  The only thing I can find that is NOT historically correct off the top of my head is that in real life Lee asked for time to decide between his country and his state.  I also wish that they had covered what actually happened at the Wilderness better.  The Wilderness caught on fire, and the soldiers who were wounded, but not killed, burned to death.  This is a part of the battle that was completely left out of the movie.",1174089600,3,595,4.363636363636363
2620001,5,B000GW8OA0,"My son's and I have recently moved to North Carolina and have an interest in the Civil War.  These 2 movies are excellently done.  The visual and audio effects are both tasteful and artful.  One of my son's was studying the Civil War in High School and he enjoyed the movies very much.  I would recommend either of these movies to any one, not just Civil War enthusiasts!  Pop some pop corn and enjoy these movies with the whole family.  However, I would want to watch them first before allowing young viewers to watch them.  They are war movies, afterall.

2620002,5,B000GW8OA0,"Both of these movies are based on the books by father and son historians Michael & Jeff Shaara. Gettysburg is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book ""The Killer Angels"". No school library should be without these two wonderful films and the related books. These movies were filmed using reinactors and are very realistic and very close to actual events. These films were made by Ted Turner and part of a trilogy. The third movie about the defeat of the Confederacy may or may not be completed (PLEASE Ted do the film!!). A fourth movie ""Andersonville"" is about the infamous southern prison camp (not for the squeamish!!).

I cannot recommend these movies highly enough. They are GREAT films for every American to view at least once so that they understand how terrible the Civil War really was. Very entertaining and not to be missed.",1162598400,102,835,4.798611111111111

My problem is not so much with the content of Gettysburg but with the quality of the DVD's I received. I bought them Used in ""Very Good"" condition on Amazon. Both Gettysburg and Gods & Generals looked like they were just blank DVD's that someone copied these two films onto. I'm not 100% sure but I think my copy of Gettsburg is missing the ending as mine ended quite abruptly. If you buy it, buy it new.",1500940800,,519,4.3061224489795915

2620031,5,B000GW8OA0,I read the books first. The movie did an excellent portrail of the characters in the book. Gettysburg  was well done beginning with the Union Cavalry general realizing the value of high ground in Gettysburg. The sadness of Picketts charge knowing they would die was well done. This movie is part of my permanent library. I lost my first copy in a movie and was happy to find Gettysburg with Gods and Generals in one jacket.,1454544000,,423,4.565789473684211

2620034,5,B000GW8OA0,"Slow going in some parts, but a great way to introduce a curiosity about history with new Americans, students and the younger generation. The films have inspired me to read more about the Civil War, in depth, beyond the dry facts I was lectured on at school. My favorite performances were by Jeff Daniels and Robert Duval. One of the most endearing story-lines was that of Stonewall Jackson. A must-have in your video library.

I take no share in believing that the Conferderate flag has a place foremost and out there in our history.  Do not push it into a dark corner of a museum.",1438214400,,499,4.276595744680851

The acting is superb, scenery wonderful and the Gettysburg film was on site in actual places where things had occurred. Well worth the money and I will watch these over again. How wonderful to have the re-enactors who provided all of the necessary corps in actual costumes and equipment to fill out the battles.
They were magnificent and these films looked so real, and the cannons so loud you were completely drawn into the battles. Wonderful films, I highly recommend  them to anyone who loves history.",1433635200,2,629,4.770642201834862

2620068,4,B000GW8OA0,"This ""two-pack"" edition of GODS AND GENERALS and GETTTSBURG is well worth the moderate price I paid for it.  Both movies are based  on historic novels by Michael Shaara (GETTYSBURG) and his son Jeff (G & G).  In spite of being novels, both movies (and books) are grounded in accurate fact.  Everything depicted in them actually happened.  The production values of both motion pictures are exceptionally high, particularly in the battle sequences.  If there is any drawback to either movie, it is that GODS AND GENERALS, like the historical novel, covers a period of over two years.  While this is no problem in the novel, it made it difficult to portray in a motion picture.  However, GODS AND GENERALS does as good a job of this as could be expected.  GETTYSBURG does a superb job of portraying the battle. better than most documentaries.  This double-feature edition is a must-have for any Civil War buff and anyone with an interest in American history.  I only hope that Ted Turner will soon proceed with making the final novel of the Shaara trilogy, THE LAST FULL MEASURE, into a motion picture soon!",1425081600,3,1104,4.788359788359788

We were so impressed with the history surrounding and engulfing the whole town we just had to take it to the next step and view the battles itself.  The movie Gettysburg is fascinating as it is actually filmed  on location, and we recognized many spots we visited on the battlefield tours. Also, they used  Civil War rein-actors which is brilliant as they already have their own uniforms. Genius!  And would probably do the battles for free. Now Martin Sheen as Lee was a bit of a stretch but that's nitpicking really.  God and Generals is actually a better movie.  Robert Duvall is a better General Lee.

I was raised in the South and was taught that the Union was evil.  However, these movies helped dissuade that thinking right away.  In the movie ""Gettysburg,"" I was surprised to find that one of the true heroes in the battle was a Union officer, Colonel Chamberlain, and that was out of necessity.  The one thing I would have loved to see was the movies done in chronological order.  (""Gods and Generals"" was made 10 years after ""Gettysburg"" even though the Gettysburg battle happened after the events depicted in ""Gods and Generals."")  Regardless, both movies were excellent, and I gained new appreciation and respect for the actor Jeff Daniels, even though I saw these long after the stupid movie, ""Dumb and Dumber.""",1385769600,,842,4.687074829931973

2620116,5,B000GW8OA0,"'Gettysburg' presents' the background to the pivotal Civil War battle that stopped the northern incursion of the Confederate Army led by General Robert E. Lee (Martin Sheen).  Tom Berenger shines as a Confederate Army Lt. General James 'Pete' Longstreet but Sheen comes across too sheepish as General Lee.  C. Thomas Howell and Jeff Daniels are believable as the Chamberlain brothers who are in the Union Army. Sam Elliott, Kevin Conway and Richard Jordan are fine in supporting roles. The battle lasts over three days in life and over two hours in the film.

The second film, 'Gods and Generals' gives us a quasi-intimate view into the lives of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and Lt. General Thomas J. 'Stonewall' Jackson.  It is extremely well-acted and perfectly executed. Stephen Lang shines as Jackson and Robert Duvall is magnificent as General Robert E. Lee.  Stephen Lang returns as General Pickett. The strategy, drama and action of the battles pull the viewer in without any problems.  The ideological reasons for the secession war are presented with much emotion and passion.  What does become apparent is the blindness of both sides as to the truths which are evident through history.  This is a fantastic historical war film.",1370476800,3,1241,5.078817733990148

One of the items I discovered was a ""War: Double Feature"" DVD featuring ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals,"" two highly acclaimed movies depicting the American Civil War. They're good documentary-style movies and something that every American might benefit in viewing. However, both are long and tedious and I wouldn't want to watch either a second time. Civil war buffs might feel quite differently, I might add. If you watch both, I would suggest viewing ""Gods and Generals"" first, then take a break and watch ""Gettysburg"" second. I did it backwards of this order. Both movies are rather similar in their directing, costuming, photography and so on. They're a well-matched pair. The acting is stiff and wooden and reminds me of British historical things. The photography and scenery is excellent. The battles are, well, you have to see them. In this day and age with our drones and smart bombs and all, it's hard to believe that wars were fought on this level, but it's probably close to the truth considering the casualty rate of the Civil War. In any case, it's a very worth-while pair of movies.

2620142,2,B000GW8OA0,"As a teacher of US History for 20 years, I had high hopes for these movies. Good cast, lots of production value; I even previewed ""Gods and Generals"" at the National Social Studies Conference when it came out, and got to ask Ted Turner a question at the press conference.

I should have known. Anyone who could make the battle of Gettysburg pompous and boring wouldn't have a prayer when making a film about Stonewall Jackson. In ""Gettysburg,"" everyone was fat, 40, had clean uniforms, and struck a pose before saying every line. The music swelled after everyone said anything, I guess to make sure we knew it was Significant.

 Turner noted in his address at the conference, that the average soldier then was 19 years old, about 5'6"", weighing in at about 135. So, In the sequel, Turner had all of the skinny young guys come up to the front to make it look better, but couldn't resist putting his wrinkled old self right in the front with them...

Even this heroic effort couldn't save G&G from a ponderous script full of ponderous statements and Important-Moment-Pay-Attention Music.
 The reenactors had a blast shooting both of these movies, but unless you are actually in this movie or know some of the guys who are, don't waste your time.",1285632000,4,1243,4.68348623853211

2620144,4,B000GW8OA0,"Gettysburg is based on the book ""Killer Angels"", which is recommended reading for Marine and U.S. Army officers.  Both the book and the movie are riveting.  I believe that this battle shows clearly that Lee was much better at managing a defense and/or withdrawl, than he was at conducting an offensive campaign.  Had Union General Techumusa Sherman been in Lee's shoes, I doubt that the second and third day battles would not have been fought.  In the movie, General Longstreet pleads with General Lee on the second and third days to avoid attacking the high ground but instead to maneuver into a position that would require the Union to attack them instead.  Lee did not feel well at Gettysburg, and that may have affected his judgement.  In the movie, Lee does look tired and inattentive to what Longstreet is trying to convey.  Col Chamberlain's heroic stand on Little Round Top was the best part of the movie.

Unfortunately, Gods and Generals has way, way too much character development and not enough action.  Similarly, important campaigns such as Antietem and the Shenandoah Valley were left out, which were important to the development of the Stonewall Jackson legend.

Stephen Lang (Avatar's Colonel Miles Quaritch) gives a great acting performance as General George Pickett in Gettysburg and General Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals.  Jeff Daniels also does a masterful job in both movies as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.

Gettysburg is clealy 5 stars if you are a Civil War history buff.
Gods and Generals is 3 stars.

While the films are generally historically accurate, their real power lies in how they dramatize the details of the personalities.  The acting is excellent and it really illuminates the complexities of the people and the times- the scale of suffering and the contradictions of civil war- brothers fighting brothers, friends fighting friends. Oftentimes so-called enemies shared the same beliefs and opinions as each other on issues central to the very reason of the war (seen here on several occasions regarding the questions of slavery and democracy).  Jeff Daniels is excellent as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the decorated Civil War hero and favorite son of Maine who led the defense of Little Round Top, arguable the pivotal battle of Gettysburg.  The late actor Richard Jordan gave a truly inspired performance as General Lewis Armistead.  But these are just two of a number of brilliant performances- the entire cast brought their personas to life and wove them into both films perfectly.

Watching These two great actors playing off of each other and giving the preformances of their lives is a treat not to be missed.
  Adding great preformances by Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell as the as the Chamberlain Brothers and by all of the other great actors, the great civil war reinactors and fantastic music by Randy Edelman make this the very best Civil War Epic ever produced. Picketts Charge, like the historic one, has a true cast of thousands.
  This product also includes The Prequel Gods and Generals, installment #2 of the great Trilogy. Although fine actors Duvall/Boxleitner are fine as the Lee/Longstreet duo, they cannot possibly match Sheen/Berenger performance. It is my sincerest hope that the great Sheen/Berenger return for the final installment.
  Although currently owning both movies on single disc editions,this bargain priced back up was far to good to pass up. When completed, this Trilogy could put Ted Turner on par with George Lukas great Star Wars Trilogies. Three Cheers for Ted Turner.",1260921600,,1537,5.144578313253012
2620155,5,B000GW8OA0,Gettysburg / Gods and Generals is an action packed movie that is based on the Civil War. This movie puts you right into the action and you learn a little American History along the way.,1259539200,,185,4.314285714285714
2620156,4,B000GW8OA0,These movies are great. They give the viewer a great eeling of patriotism and thanks. Giving us all a reason to look back tothe past and salute all the men who died in this terrible war and allowing us to feel what both sides did.

2620158,5,B000GW8OA0,"One on the best Civil War movies I've ever seen. The starkness and raw emotions depicted in this movie, makes one think they've witnessed the carniage first hand. Historical in every way. Little known facts if what the soldiers endured are brought to the attention of the viewer. The reasons for secession from a southern perspective are expressed in a very frank way. An education for most who are not from the regions that comprised the Confederacy.

Gettyburg, side A was worth the price of the whole series. Side B leans a little bit too much to understand the south, but very understandable. Lee is not as well played as in God's and Generals. Great history and I should note that the extras on God's and Generals are also good. Too much description of how it was made in Gettyburgs extras and less explanation on the history.",1240185600,,549,4.392156862745098
2620160,5,B000GW8OA0,"These two movies show not only the various battles (Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, which got its own movie) but also the ideals on both sides.  ""Gods & Generals"" introduces us to ""Stonewall"" Jackson as he changes careers from VMI professor to a prominent commander that Lee relied upon.  We see Lee turn down a Union command, only to pick up his sword for Virginia.  The 20th Maine Regiment is formed, and the viewer is introduced to Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, his brother Thomas, and of course a beloved character, Sgt. Buster Kilrain -- the very same men featured so prominently in the sequel, ""Gettysburg.""  It was a treasure to see so many actors reprise their roles from ""Gettysburg.""

I recommend this set for the simple fact that you get both Civil War movies in one single package.  Both movies are great and show not only amazing battle scenes, but also great human relationships in various ways.  The music video for ""Going Home"" by Mary Fahl is amazing and shows scenes from ""Gods & Generals.""  There are many more special features that extend the experience and leaves the viewer with a more solid understanding of the history without having to visit a museum.",1238889600,,1208,4.887254901960785

2620162,5,B000GW8OA0,This is well worth every minute of your time. The best Civil War movie we have ever seen. It is very in depth and detailed and not just some flaky war movie with only part of the real story. It is a long movie but if you like detail in regards to the Civil War then this is for you. The action is very well done and true to life. I also love to hear about the faith of Stonewall Jackson in Gods and Generals.

2620172,3,B000GW8OA0,"Ironies abound: while Gettysburg was made for television but ended up with a theatrical release, yet despite a $60m budget, a huge cast and being shot in 2.35:1 widescreen, Gods and Generals looks like it would have been more at home on TV. In some ways it's almost the most expensive home movie ever shot, with Ted Turner paying for this account of the early years of the American Civil War out of his own pocket. For the first hour it's almost as if the Union never existed, the film shown entirely from the Southern side, and with a very partisan view at that (all down to Yankee aggression, with Fort Sumpter conveniently dismissed in a single line). Too often lengthy quotations take the place of dialogue and even the better actors in the cast often seem ill at ease while the surprisingly weak daylight photography and poor CGi matte painting in early scenes giving it an air of storybook unreality. Indeed, Ronald Maxwell's approach at times seems pure D.W. Griffith, with a fondness for awkward tableaux and unconvincing sentiment (poor Mira Sorvino gets a couple of particularly painfully hearts-and-flowers scenes to deliver as a consolation prize for missing out on playing Joan of Arc when Maxwell's version was dropped in the wake of Luc Besson's film). There are a few moments here and there - an intimate scene between Stonewall Jackson and his wife confiding his doubts, a scene between Jeff Daniels and Kevin Conway's sergeant about friends on the other side - but as the over-ambitious film tries to cram too much history into its four hour running time (and still scenes filmed dealing with Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth and the Battle of Antietem didn't make the cut) the people just get lost.

Thankfully, the second half rallies considerably as the film reaches the Battle of Fredericksburg and the 20th Maine's disastrous charge, and the contradictions in Stephen Lang's ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a deeply religious man yet one who advocated taking no prisoners, become more interesting despite the film's determination to turn him into across between Jesus Christ and a vengeful Old Testament prophet. Yet sadly the lasting impression is of a film that is too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good and one that not only either needed to be a lot longer or a lot shorter but also much better written. As for the somewhat nonsensical title, it's an abbreviation of the novel's Faith in Gods and Generals. Incidentally, be warned that the DVD has one of the worst side breaks ever. Some fairly decent DVD extras, but the lack of deleted scenes implies a director's cut may be in the offing some time in the future.

Gettysburg is actually the second part in an intended trilogy that will now probably never be completed in the wake of the dismal box-office for the bloated Gods and Generals. Thankfully it gains more by having a smaller canvas, focussing on one single battle and largely on three actions - Buford's inspired initial defense on the first day, Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge - and by seeing the action from the viewpoint of both sides throughout. The characters are better drawn, the dialogue feels more natural and you get much more of a sense of what a human tragedy the war was. As a British observer on the Confederate side points out, it all boils down to ""same people, different dreams.""

The problem with most epics devoted to single battles or campaigns (Waterloo, Zulu Dawn, The Battle of Neretva etc) is that without a single dominating personality they often get so bogged down with history or strategy that the human element gets lost, with a succession of stars acting almost like anonymous interchangeable sports commentators only there to explain what's going on for the layman. Gettysburg has its share of characters primarily there for exposition, but by narrowing its focus to a few of them and drawing on their own letters and memoirs it's able to give them a little more depth and personality. Martin Sheen's Lee's increasingly wrong-headed strategy as he consigns more and more men to pointless deaths with a homespun rationale that leads to horrifying casualties contrasts well with Tom Berenger's more cautious Longstreet gradually realising that the tide has turned against them while Jeff Daniels' awkward but sincere Lawrence Chamberlain gives a humane and decent voice to the Union's case. Richard Jordan is genuinely affecting in his last role - his final scene is even more moving with the knowledge that he really was dying at the time - and even George Lazenby even turns up briefly. As a result, there's more involvement in what's happening and more understanding of what's at stake on a personal level to both sides during the battle. Although shot as a TV miniseries before being released theatrically, it actually looks like a feature film, and one that manages to hold the interest over its four hour running time. It's such an impressive piece of work that you can't help but wonder why so many of the same people got it so wrong so often on Gods and Generals.

Excellent extras on the double-sided DVD, but sadly none of the deleted scenes from the 270-minute laserdisc director's cut.",1200355200,23,5163,4.870307167235495
