8348337,1,B001Z3ARM2,"This has to be one of the worst animated films that was ever released with stereotype ""singing Mexican Mice"" who look like rejects for a Speedy Gonzales cartoon, A ""cutesy face"" Octopus, A ""Rapping"" dog ( in 1912 England??) and a plot that has so many holes that you can fit a Kenworth Semi,a Railway locomotive and a 747 Jumbo Jet thru it! This film is nothing but a insult and a slap in the face to the victims of the Titanic and to the survivors as well!",1330905600,3,457,4.204545454545454
8348338,1,B001Z3ARM2,The worst movie ever made.  It stole various plots from so many other movies that you really did not know what you were watching.,1326067200,6,129,4.375
8348339,1,B001Z3ARM2,"I own this (avid Titanic fan who must have everything with that label). This movie is a nice idea, a shortened, children friendly film. But it is poor quality, with _ALOT_ of repeat footage over and over. Also if you have actualy seen the real movie don't subject yourself to this. I have a few words to aid in your descision. ""Break dancing dogs"" ""Mexican mombo mice"".",1031270400,,369,4.522388059701493
