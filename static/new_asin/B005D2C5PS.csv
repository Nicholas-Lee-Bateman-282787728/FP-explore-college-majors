8466248,5,B005D2C5PS,This DVD became an excellent resource to start my learning of Hawaiian Lomi Lomi. I especially appreciate the number of repetitions of every run and the foot moves. I can't wait for the advanced level DVD to come out:)),1378080000,3,219,4.641025641025641
8466249,5,B005D2C5PS,"This DVD truly is amazing. While it did not have the scenic Hawaiian backgrounds that you see with other Hawaiian massage DVD's, this one shows what I think most people want to see in a Lomi Lomi video, long body runs on a client with minimal draping. Mr. Ibach demonstrates what he refers to as Temple style massages. He teaches you several tips such as not using a bottom sheet, so that you can glide under the client more easily and using a crock pot to heat up your oils. What I really like about this video is he also teaches you the foot work needed to successfully do the full body runs. That is something that I think is lacking in most massage DVD's not just Lomi Lomi. The techniques are amazing and Mr. Ibach does an excellent job teaching and demonstrating them. I would highly recommend any massage therapist or massage enthusiast to purchase this DVD and watch it over and over again.",1330473600,15,898,4.448484848484848
