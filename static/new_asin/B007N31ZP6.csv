5100060,4,B007N31ZP6,This is a very good movie. I liked it very much. I especially liked the cool Jewish stuff. I did not understand all of the Jewish expressions. But I still liked the movie.,1342051200,5,171,4.212121212121212
5100061,2,B007N31ZP6,"Saw first 30 minutes waiting for this movie to take off with some excitement, drama or comedy.. Not wasting 2 hours on this",1341792000,3,123,4.391304347826087
5100062,5,B007N31ZP6,Every Baseball fan and Jew should see this movie. This is a great movie for frends to get together and watch. Also fun movie for a temple togther.,1339027200,4,146,4.25
5100063,5,B007N31ZP6,"This is a very enjoyable movie with a big heart. It takes the classic underdog gets a second chance theme and presents it in its own unique way. It centers on a baseball team, but it is not a ""sports"" movie. It takes place at a Yeshiva, but it is not a religious movie. Rather, it's a feel-good movie with likeable characters that will absolutely leave a smile on your face. As far as originality, it does hew to the well-known cinematic theme of underdogs doing well under the guidance of new leadership, however much originality is here in context of the setting, the characters and their cultural struggles with the sport, as well as an interesting plot twist that may prevent them from ultimately playing in an important league tournament. I first saw it on the big screen, and now that it is out on Blu-ray (as well as on Amazon Instant Video), I plan on having it as part of my permanent home library as well!",1339027200,10,915,4.4523809523809526

5100065,5,B007N31ZP6,"Very interesting movie, enjoyable.  Everyone should see it.",1411084800,,59,6.375
5100066,3,B007N31ZP6,"Unfocused, unoriginal, unusual and upbeat. ""The Yankles"" is an uneven but ultimately entertaining and educational peek into Orthodox Jewish culture. The baseball themes are mostly imitative. The baseball scenes are up and down, and I'm not clear on what the Orthodox practice is concerning marriage, but my favorite thing about the movie is the music. It's sweeter than kosher wine.",1409270400,,382,5.383333333333334
5100067,3,B007N31ZP6,"You don't believe for a second that a Rabbinical college would field a collegiate baseball team, much less a College World Series contender.  I won't go into how much talent and experience it takes to play baseball at the college level, let's just say it's amazing.  Also, the movie did not need the Bad News Bears ex-major league player doing community service schtick.  That's been done in nearly every other baseball movie.  It seemed like an afterthought, anyway.  The sister was also an after thought and unnecessary distraction.  The more interesting, and better acted aspect was Eliot, the ex-minor league player turned Rabbi, and his contrived troubles with his ex-major league player father.  I could have taken a little more Don Most with a little less one-dimension to his character.  The movie didn't fully use it's best assets, and instead tried to add stuff it did not need. Shoulda made it about Eliot, and called it Pride of the Yankles.",1399852800,,953,4.9125
5100068,5,B007N31ZP6,"We enjoyed this independent film tremendously.  We purchased it because a relative has a small part in the film, and found the story quite charming and engaging.  The acting and cinematography were excellent.",1398729600,,208,5.2727272727272725
5100069,5,B007N31ZP6,"Wonderfully funny, inspiring moving that teaches something. This movie looks into the lives of students of a Orthodox Jewish college whose Rabbi starts a baseball team and the stumbling blocks they encounter. All is well in the end and it proves that you don't have to give up your morals and sense of honor to have fun. It also gives a brief peak into the Orthodox Jewish religion.",1395360000,,382,4.632352941176471
5100070,5,B007N31ZP6,A most excellent wonderful movie I've seen. It has something for anyone. Funny and  So enjoyable. Whole family enjoyed it.,1382832000,,122,5.1
5100071,5,B007N31ZP6,"I really like this movie. It is entertaining, and it has a wonderful message. It, I believe, can also help people be more tolerant of other people and religions, because through this movie one feels as though you understand other cultures better. As Mark Twain said; travel to other places and cultures helps cure prejudice. This movie is like traveling to the place where the Yankles began and enjoying the journey with them.

5100072,5,B007N31ZP6,"hubby and I loved the humor AND good ethical lessons learned.  since I do not like swearing at all, especially using God's Name in vain, I cringed when His Name was used as a swear word.  Other then that, it was a great movie!  I dare film makers to make movies where there is no sexual inuendos, cursing, violence.  It can be done.  these three situations don't make a movie good.",1377475200,,381,4.309859154929577
5100073,5,B007N31ZP6,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny at times, poignant at times.  It told a good story. I am not surprised it won that many awards.",1373673600,,137,4.074074074074074
5100074,4,B007N31ZP6,"Very cute movie, even though not realisti,c but definitely worth renting or adding to your video collection.  The premise is more than a stretch.  No Haredi (Chassidic) Yeshiva would field a baseball team with other colleges and the Mormon actors often butcher the Hebrew pronounciation, even for a Yeshivish accent.  Rabbinical Yeshivot (plural of Yeshiva) don't usually have 'grades' and student can range from high school through retired seniors.  But if you can get past that, and most everyone will, it's a fun piece of cinema.  Well acted, well videographed and well put together.",1373587200,,586,5.191489361702128
5100075,2,B007N31ZP6,An ok movie.  Different (slightly) plotline than some sports movies.  Don't think I'd enthusiastically recommend it.  Not related to the Yankees.,1373500800,,145,5.809523809523809
5100076,5,B007N31ZP6,"Great Movie -
The rabbi was the only real looking jewish character

The other boys didn't even look jewish, otherwise movie was well played",1373241600,,139,4.791666666666667
5100077,3,B007N31ZP6,"I enjoyed it anyway.  The Jewish scenes (okay, the whole movie is Jewish scenes) seem to have been written by someone who knew something about Jews and Judaism, but not very much.  It's the kind of movie that a group of kids might have made, with no depth to the characters, a plot you can predict from miles away, and every stereotype about Orthodox Jews thrown in, but there was enough fun in it to make it worth watching, but only if you are a baseball fan and a practicing Jew.",1367712000,,481,4.274725274725275
5100078,5,B007N31ZP6,The movie was the best I ever saw funny cute and sexy good jokes excellent lines to learn from so go buy it watch it with a friends bring all and enjoy Ty,1367712000,,154,3.696969696969697
5100079,3,B007N31ZP6,"was entertaining. I like sports movies,so I found this one to be ok. I am glad it was free. thanks",1362960000,,98,3.95
5100080,5,B007N31ZP6,A dad growing up and finally doing the right thing is a big part of this film.  Baseball is the cornerstone but warmth and persoanal feelings are what makes it.  Good film for most people to see.,1362441600,,195,4.243243243243243
5100081,4,B007N31ZP6,Enjoyed reading this one - kind of comically and almost unbeilevable but it kept my interest throughout the reading.  Recoomend to others.,1362355200,,138,5.2727272727272725
5100082,4,B007N31ZP6,"When Yankles came up on Prime, we decided we had to check it out for ""bad movie night"".  The premise was hilarious, so we expected it to be delightfully awful, instead it was a funny feel good movie.  It's not a blockbuster for sure, but the characters are enjoyable, the plot flows well.  This is kind of the jewish ""A league of their own"" with plenty of comedy, some fair baseball scenes, and a little romance.",1361923200,,412,4.394736842105263
5100083,5,B007N31ZP6,This movie was an unexpected treasure. Wasn't expecting much and ended up really enjoying it! Very funny! Light hearted and appropriate for all ages,1358294400,,148,5.208333333333333

5100085,4,B007N31ZP6,A long time friend recommended The Yankels and I couldn't resist.  A good overall story line with some nice surprises too.  I'll watch it again.  Very good movie and overall safe for most ages.,1357603200,,193,4.617647058823529
5100086,5,B007N31ZP6,"This is not a baseball movie, this is not a Jewish movie ... this is a movie about the underdog, heart, and an ending with a twist.  No wonder it has won so many festival awards.  See it, you'll love it.",1357084800,,203,3.926829268292683
5100087,5,B007N31ZP6,This is one of the most heart-warming movies I have ever seen.  It has a poignant story and is quite funny.,1354838400,,107,4.095238095238095
5100088,4,B007N31ZP6,"A light hearted movie, lets you put your brain on ""relax"" mode.  Suited for all ages.  A funny insight into the ""men in black"" (Hassidim).",1353974400,,138,4.48
5100089,5,B007N31ZP6,I saw this movie in Dallas at the Jewish Film Festival and love it. Great movie and fun for the family...,1353888000,,105,4.0476190476190474
5100090,5,B007N31ZP6,This movie is for all baseball fans and especially people who know something about ultra orthodox jewish sects.  It was a very good movie with somewhat of a twist ending.,1353369600,,170,4.666666666666667
5100091,4,B007N31ZP6,"This is one of those quirky little fun films that you walk away from feeling lighter, with a smile on your face.  Not chicken soup for the soul, more like blintzes for the soul. Michael Buster is quite charming as Elliot!  Would love to see him land more film roles.",1349568000,,266,4.3
5100092,5,B007N31ZP6,Oh I can't tell you how funny this is... loved it!  The original Bad News Bears was a pleasure and this reminded me of that movie... it is goooood xox,1347148800,,150,4.0
5100093,3,B007N31ZP6,quality of dvd was poor. if i didn't enjoy the story as much as i did i would have returned the dvd.,1344902400,,100,3.590909090909091
5100094,5,B007N31ZP6,"Had been awaiting the release of this movie ever since I heard about it.  Thouroughly enjoyed the story.  While the cast was mostly unknown to me I found them to be quite good. Will watch it over again with my family and whenever I want a good laugh. You do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this movie about a yeshiva baseball team which finds its way into a its athletic association's ""world series.""  Would like to have gotten to know more about the team's subsequent history.",1343001600,,484,4.355555555555555
