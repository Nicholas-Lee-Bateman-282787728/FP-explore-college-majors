6493428,4,B00LNBQ8UG,"To start, I'll write a quick review for folks who aren't already Godzilla fans. If you enjoyed the new American Godzilla film, and you're checking out the Japanese series for the first time - this Blu-ray two-pack is a great place to start. Both of these films have surprisingly good special effects (of a dated type), decent human characters and tons of giant-lizard action. Indeed, Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (GMK) is considered by some fans, including yours truly, to be the best Godzilla film since the 1954 original. Just be prepared for a more evil incarnation of Godzilla than the one featured in the American version.

Now, to review this set for dedicated Godzilla fans. If you're an aficionado, you probably already own these films on DVD. And you're asking yourself, ""Is it worth 'double-dipping' by buying the Blu-rays?"" The answer to that question is...sort of.

I'll begin by reviewing GMK, which I was particularly excited to see on Blu-ray. The film's old DVD release had a notable flaw - the English translation of the Japanese dialogue was allegedly loose and contained several silly lines that just didn't make sense. Frustratingly enough, *some* of these silly lines have been corrected in the Blu-ray version, but not all of them. For example - at one point, two Japanese soldiers attack Godzilla, but accidentally miss and hit Ghidorah instead. In the proper Japanese version, both soldiers express frustration when this happens. In the old American DVD, both soldiers seem *happy* when this happens - a clear misinterpretation of the Japanese dialogue. And now, on this American Blu-ray...one of the soldiers is happy, and the other one is upset. So, they fixed half the problem with the translation, but left the other half in. Nice going, guys.

As for the picture quality - well, there's some controversy about it. While the print is a clear step up from the DVD version, it just doesn't ""pop"" the way I expected it to. Indeed, several of the scenes have a ""soft"" look to them, lacking the striking clarity I'd expect from a Blu-ray. I've checked out some discussions about this release on Blu-ray forums, and many commentators agree with me. What's not clear to me is whether we could've reasonably expected better picture quality; possibly, this is the best print we could ever hope for from an aging low-budget movie, but I can't help being a bit disappointed. Despite my complaints, it's still a decent print - indeed, I'd never noticed the taste buds on Godzilla's tongue before, so obviously there's clearer detail here than on DVD. The sound quality, meanwhile, is great; the closing-credits version of Godzilla's march really exploded out of my speakers.

Godzilla x Mechagodzilla clearly has the better print of the two films, but this is somewhat of a double-edged sword; while the film has a crisper look, it also looks faker than GMK, and the merciless clarity of Blu-ray makes it easier to notice how cheesy some of the model buildings are. Still, overall I prefer the clearer print. But even this Blu-ray is a bit flawed, because it's supposed to contain the film's theatrical trailer, and instead includes the trailer for a much older film featuring Mechagodzilla.

The overall feeling I'm getting is that this is a quick, cheap Blu-ray release that nobody put much effort into. Still, both movies are cool, and these are the best prints of them available on the U.S. market. If you're still unsure whether or not to ""double-dip"" on them, maybe you could try a search of major Blu-ray forums, where users have posted DVD-vs.-Blu-ray comparisons for both films. That should help you figure out whether the upgrade is worth your hard-earned cash...",1410566400,22,3690,4.945161290322581
6493429,5,B00LNBQ8UG,"During this time, I did a Pre-Order on this one of a kind 2 Movies for the Price of One and in Blu-Ray! Truly Worth for any Diehard Fans. This time the Big G returns originally in a fresh new take as pure EVIL summoned by vengeful ghosts that lost their lives in the Pacific War during WW2.(Quite Understandable). Of Course as the title stands it out, not only does Mothra, and Ghidorah(later morphs into King Ghidorah!) make spectacular breathtaking comebacks, but so does another legendary monster take on the Big G for the first time ever. BARAGON !!! Sure this bad puppy maybe small fry, but that dude is One Tough Rottweiler. The Film stands out well on it's own from the other chronological series with it's own design of fantasy, myth, and folklore culture. Much of what I loved about the millennial series are the end credit scenes that may or may not follow up which in this film I would have so much anticipation fun to watch a GIANTMONSTERSALLATTACK2.
 In GODZILLA AGAINST MECHAGODZILLA. So far this film brings out a whole new perspective take on Godzilla's mechanical counterpart. This time (allegedly) the machine is built and genetically engineered by humans with the remains of the original bones of the first Godzilla destroyed by the Oxygen Destroyer. In essence the new Kiryu is a Semi Artificial Living Cyborg rather than an Engineered Android as G-Force wanted it. Kiryu was designed with an incredible weapon capable of instant Freeze targets at SubZero Degrees. Of Course Not All Goes Smoothly as well in the first match up encounter. As the new Kiryu makes its first move on an seemly Disbelief mean smirking Godzilla(I bet Godzilla was like ""What The Hell Have You All Done To My Dad?!"") The Big G Roars OutLoud awakening the Ghostly Conscious of the Original G rigging Kiryu out of control complete Rampage. (Godzilla at this point hops back into the ocean as if ""LATER DUDES!, I'M OUTTA HERE!, IT'S ALL YOUR'S POPS""!) Anyways the movie is a bit so overly outdone with the human drama a bit you get the sense of ""Let's Get Back Into The Action!"" Either way a newly repaired under control Kiryu is given the OK approval for a rematch. This time the fight scene doesn't hold back except for one technical difficulty taking too long to fix again scene. Don't worry the Action Get's Back On Track in Sumo Wrestling Boxing Style Tail Whipping Karate HiiiyyyAAH Mortal Combat with an Ultimate MechaG Finishing SubZero Move. FATALE???!!! NAY ! Luckily for Godzilla Fans the Film really doesn't end there as an End Credit Clip continues the Next Film GODZILLA-X-MOTHRA-X-MECHAGODZILLA:TOKYO.S.O.S. which you will have to buy it too separate from this duo pack. By all the film is like another beginning reboot in it's own with familiar film chronological outtakes and background story plot based on TOHO's Original Classics. Worth buying in BluRay. I can Hardly wait to get my hands on these versions.",1407542400,11,2919,4.814741035856573
6493430,5,B00LNBQ8UG,"This is a great value for a set that packs two of the most entertaining entries in the Godzilla movie franchise. Not of the most well-written or well-directed, but of the most entertaining. Serious fans will undoubtedly love the two films, but for others new to Kaiju media, it may take a while to suspend some disbelief for these two particular films. Both the GMAA (Giant Monsters All-Out Attack) and the Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla movies exist to showcase pure, unencumbered monster brawls, much in the same way that Pacific Rim fulfilled the fantasy of seeing a giant monster being whacked by a cargo ship. With that said, the two films show high merit for what it really sets out to do.

What results, then, are certain shortcomings in a few aspects of the two films. While the plot is alright in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, I felt that the writers for GMAA tried to bite off more than they could chew with the premise of having Godzilla, a villain this time around, as being possessed by the Japanese victims of World War II. It's an interesting idea, but by the time other heavyweights like Baragon, Mothra, and King Ghidorah are thrown into the mix, that idea seems to get pushed aside with a poor attempt to try and combine it with the entertaining fights. This is a minor nuisance, but it's something to keep in mind.

Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, definitely more focused than GMAA, also pits Godzilla as the antagonist, this time fighting a retooled version of Mechagodzilla. It is not a full protagonist because it does, at one point in the film, decide to rampage through a city ('decide' is a stretch, but you'll have to watch it to understand the reasoning for it). The human elements and melodrama is thankfully toned down, and it also meshes acceptably well with the action scenes in the film. It's just unfortunate how short the runtime is in this film, as well as how less intricacies are given to Godzilla himself. All in all, though, there's just a great sense of Kaiju fun in this film.

Both are separate storylines in the franchise, so they only serve as sequels to the original 1954 film, and not other past entries. As mentioned before, getting past the ridiculous premise of Godzilla movies - and the fact that you're really just seeing actors in rubber suits duke it out - will allow you to find how truly enjoyable they really are. Having Blu-Ray copies of these two fight-filled monster flicks for the price of virtually one makes for a welcome value. If you're actively deciding on which Godzilla films you'd want to at least try, then these pair of films are certainly worth your time.",1406678400,8,2628,4.721132897603486

6493459,5,B00LNBQ8UG,"GMK is by far the best Godzilla film in the millennial series and one of the best in the entire history of kaiju film. A departure from the more mainstream Godzilla cookie cutter layout. Better SFX and story than almost all others. Do yourself a favor if you're a fan of this genre and watch this one.

 The second film, Mechagodzilla, is fine as far as kaiju features go. Very heavy handed at times and a bit all over with timing, story and effects. Okay as a watch but not nearly as good as the GMK film that it shares the case with.",1479772800,3,535,4.184466019417476

6493465,4,B00LNBQ8UG,"When you look at top 10 best Godzilla movie rankings they tend to be all over the place. One persons treasure is often another persons trash and vice versa but every list Ive seen has placed Godzilla, Mothra & King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack ahead of the 2002 Godzilla Against Mechgodzilla but I emphatically disagree. In fact, one review said the weakness of GaM was the human character story dominating the plot. As far as Im concerned it IS the character story that makes GaM one of the best Godzilla movies of all time.

The best quote Ive seen about All-Out Attack is from siliconexit.com which stated, if you go into Godzilla films hoping to see fights so lopsided that Godzilla is practically giving wedgies, this is the film for you Im not even sure if this was intended as a criticism or a compliment but as far as Im concerned this is THE major weakness of the film. Godzilla is on a killing rampage and its up to the protectors of Earth to stop him. This includes Mothra, King Ghidorah and Baragon. Note that this film plot has this being Godzillas first appearance since 1954 so all continuity besides the first film is wiped out.

The moment you see Baragon its clear he is no match for Godzilla and indeed he gets his spikey ass handed to him. Godzilla doesnt just defeat Baragon he immolates him entirely using his atomic breath while barely expending a drop of sweat. Thats cool though because the big buildup is for the appearance of Mothra and King Ghidorah. Mothra hits Godzilla with some kind of stinger assault and King Ghidorah clamps on with his three heads right before Godzilla smacks Ghidorah down with a knockout blow and blasts Mothra to glittery dust. Wait, what??? Thats it??? Mothra essence manages to revive King Ghidorah and he glows with renewed energy but even the combined might of Mothra and King Ghidorah are simply no match.

The Godzilla suit design is All-Out Attack looks strange. His body looks overly fat and his head sits awkwardly on a neck that occasionally looks broken. Ghidorahs necks look stumpier than normal which gives him a less grandiose appearance and Baragon looks like the nerd of giant monsters. Well, he is Baragon so I guess thats to be expected. Mothra looked fine.

I really don't get the lack of love for Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. This is the first and only Godzilla movie where I became invested in the human story. Not only was it well written and emotional it also had some very fine acting. And to those who think that All-Out Attack must be better because of the Kaiju on Kaiju fighting in my opinion the battle between Godzilla and Mechagodzilla is far better than anything offered up in All-Out Attack. This was a very back and forth fight rather than an extended beatdown and Mechagodzilla looked damn good.

Both the Godzilla and Mechagodzilla suits are excellent and I was impressed by the special effects. Making a guy in a rubber suit look huge and believable is hard and Toho has failed quite often. There are some dodgy effects here but overall the film uses good camera angles and detailed models. A kaiju like Destroyah looks great in still shots but has almost no movement in the film. Mechagodzilla looks good and moves well. As far as Im concerned Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla is one of my top favorite Godzilla movies and far better than Godzilla, Mothra & King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack despite having a smaller cast of monsters.",1470700800,5,3450,4.724252491694352

These movies are fun to watch.

Giant Monsters All-Out Attack is one of the best Godzilla movies in the franchise, IMO. Godzilla returns as a avenger of all those killed by the Japanese during World War II to punish Japan. So, he's more of a Ghost Godzilla in the tradition of Japanese Ghost stories (which are usually vengeance stories) Interestingly, King Ghidorah whom the Big G fights is a good guy in this one as well as Mothra. Pretty decent special effects for a Godzilla movies. Definitely one of the best, IMO.

Godzilla Against Mechagozilla is another Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla film where MechaG is a machine used by the Japanese Self Defense Forces. So Godzilla is a bady in this one too.",1451001600,,726,4.708661417322834

6493488,4,B00LNBQ8UG,"This is arguably the best of the various Godzilla blu-ray double-packs released during the past couple of years, simply due to the quality of both included films. I consider the unique Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (usually shortened to GMK for obvious reasons) among the very top Godzilla movies. And Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla (GxMG) is a surprisingly solid if conventional offering that seems to be advancing in reputation as fans revisit it or others discover it anew.

In this collection, each title has a disc to itself. There was a clear lack of effort put into the menus, with the same generic background image on both discs and one trailer. Oddly, the trailer on GxMG is actually for the Mechagodzilla movie from a decade earlier. Each also has the option of an adequate English dub.

There is reversible cover art that has the cover images for each title in full, one on each side. However, there is no title on the spine. Also, there is an Ultraviolet code included in the box.

Fortunately, the movies look good to great, for GMK and GxMG respectively. The former is a bit softer than one might expect but still looks appealing. Also important is the sound and both are crisp and clear here. GMK features a very aggressive Godzilla that is a truly fearsome wrecking machine with sound and music to match.

Overall, while the menu presentation and extras are lacking, this still earns a solid rating based on the solidly delivered, well-regarded movies themselves combined into a value-priced pack.",1441929600,,1546,4.934615384615385

It's got weird mystical nonsense. Fetch quests, and by far the worst physical presentation of Godzilla ever seen. The suit is black with cloudy white eyes making Big G seem like a zombie. It's better than the worst of the Showa films, but not by much.

But then the twin pack is redeemed. Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Among the absolute best modern Godzilla movies and a top contender among all of them. Just a tight story. Great Kaiju and effects.

6493505,5,B00LNBQ8UG,"Just finished watching ""Godzilla, Mothra, and King Giddorah - Giant Monsters Attack/Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla"" released by Toho Studios.
One of the more interesting aspects of the Godzillaverse is that it's fluid and filled withi interesting story lines, much like the Perry Rhodan Univerese.
In ""Godzilla, Mothra, and King Giddorah - Giant Monsters Attack"" a mystical mountain man tries to warn people that Godzilla is coming to destroy Japan as revenge for all the souls lost in the Pacific Theater during World War Two.  Naturally, when the military fails to subdue Godzilla, the mountain man awakens the Holy Beasts of Yamoto to save Japan.
""Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla"" is a rather interesting morality play on what happens when a Big Government Project is passed down from one adminisration to another.  For all the money the Japanese government has invested in MechaGodzilla, it has to work.
Yet it doesn't because its superstructure incorporates the bones of the original Godzilla and its spirit doesn't want to fight the latest incarnation of Godzilla.
Both Godzilla movies are great fun to watch.  Just don't take them too seriously.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1421280000,,1183,5.349462365591398

Giant Monsters All Out Attack is a great battle royale featuring a collection of Godzilla's fiercest foes, and Godzilla against Mechagodzilla is an awesome modern day ""reboot"" of the Mechagodzilla story. It looks like these Toho Godzilla Collection releases may be going out of print, so I would get while the getting is good!",1523491200,2,456,4.784810126582278

8666862,5,B00LNBQ8UG,Awesome bluray of two Godzilla movies from the Millennium series which you can't go wrong with and won't be disappointed at the least - GMK steals the show with Godzilla against Mechagodzilla as no slouch with interesting plots and storylines to leave you in awe - these movies plus four others were put about to make you forget about the first Americanization of Godzilla in 1998 and make a statement that Toho understands Godzilla and know how to make a good and descent Godzilla movie X 6.,1489276800,2,492,4.666666666666667
