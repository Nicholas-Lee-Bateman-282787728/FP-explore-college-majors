Being cloistered together gives them time to talk, to reflect, and to reveal feelings that had previously remained so hidden they were not really even fully acknowledged. Though one storyline still remains open to interpretation, the way is paved for us to believe it would be a very happy outcome.

Strangely this episode is not included with season 4. But that seems to be the way it is with many British shows with what they call their Christmas specials. So please be aware, if you have season 4, the last episode in that set, called Still Waters is not the last episode of the series. The final episode is Snowblind and is difficult to find. It is apparently only available with the complete set, which is an absolute fortune, or as the single episode alone. Regardless, this wonderful episode is definitely worth the effort to locate it.",1395964800,11,1007,4.820809248554913
