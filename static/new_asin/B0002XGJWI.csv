8520222,5,B0002XGJWI,"I purchased this item years ago and even still I hold a special place in my favorites for this gem.  As I watch it the movie I sometimes notice a small grin on my lips because unlike so many films these tired eyes have seen in their life, this is one of the few that has that something special most horror buffs search for and rarely ever find.

The story is a simple one.  Imagine a prison cell somewhere in France.  It's old.  The walls are surprisingly intact yet you know they couldn't hold up against a metal tool scraping away at its skin for long before they start gushing holes.  In this prison cell are two convicts who are about to welcome a third.  As all new convicts in all prisons in the world, this new guy is out of place and the elders around him aren't afraid to let him know it.  As time in the film moves ever onward the prisoners in this claustrophobic cell discover a book of magic within the weak prison cell walls.  This is no family friendly kind of magic book that you might see in some cartoon featuring talking animals and cute children.  No.  This is a book of Witchcraft.  Now imagine if you will a genuine book of witchcraft inside a prison cell housed by desperate criminals who are aching to be free.  What could possibly go wrong?

The price is high but the return is higher.  I wouldn't wait on this one.  By the time you get around to it, it may be gone.",1443916800,,1390,4.208333333333333
