8738627,4,B0001ZMWSC,"Last night I had the privilege to see Andrew Montlack's first featured film at the venerable ""Gate Hell Social"" bar and lounge in Astoria, N.Y.

BOHICA is an expensive B-movie comedy that rivals most of the trendy yet soon-to-be popular YouTube films of the moment.  The story follows a would-be director who is confronted with a host of production realities in making a movie; all while dealing with profound fallible hypotheses in his actors and incurring incredible financial burden to his crew and himself.  The movie's storyline seems to follow, coincidentally, the director's inner conflict with the outside world through the lens.

Prepare to be assaulted with on-screen incompetence and eccentricities, in a revolving stream of quirky scenes since the bizarre Ed Wood.

At the very least, Montlack's knack for the extreme and absurd, is an outstanding talent and has proved himself to be a young filmmaker to watch.",1206921600,,923,5.167785234899329
