5553925,5,B00B2V65LY,"I love water animals attack movies, but the shark is my most favorite.  This is another one of these.  Of course you will have to give up the thought process and just enjoy it for what it is a fun ""B"" movie.  Oh Ya!",1378166400,7,215,3.840909090909091
5553926,4,B00B2V65LY,"I am a huge Megalodon fan, so when this movie was released on DVD I jumped at the chance to get it. It's based on the premise that science should never mess with Mother Nature and that scientists should ALWAYS do their homework before going headlong into an experiment or with drilling in any environment.

The CGI was excellent, in comparison with some other movies I have seen. Well worth getting this movie.",1375833600,7,410,4.616438356164384
5553927,3,B00B2V65LY,Really could of been better. It was not at all scary. I like horror movies to be scary and mysterious.,1373932800,,102,4.15
5553928,1,B00B2V65LY,"One of the cheapest, most poorly produced movies to ever make it to DVD. The script is full of holes, the production is incredibly cheap (the computer generated shark looks like it was done on somebody's laptop), and the acting is just plain deplorable (with the exception of Angela Parent, the film's human villain, whose talent shines through even this horrid script. It would be nice to see what she can do in a REAL movie). It's so bad, it's not even cheesy. To top it off, the movie lasts 62 minutes, followed by 13 minutes of credits in which everyone involved gets mentioned at least twice. Don't waste your time or money on this turkey.",1373760000,8,644,4.560344827586207
5553929,2,B00B2V65LY,"Writer/director Brett Kelly deserves kudos for bringing us the year's Best Awful Film.  From its laughable special effects to incredibly bad acting and terrible music, ATTACK OF THE JURASSIC SHARK is a prime example of cinematic ineptitude.  SEE the shark swim in six inches of water!  SEE sexy girls run in slow motion boobs bouncing up and down.  SEE the huge shark jump out of the lake to chomp on the bad girl!
SEE a movie with more padding than a Maidenform bra!
This is often hilarious but ultimately really bad.  If you like bad movies, look no further!",1370390400,4,560,4.616161616161616
5553930,1,B00B2V65LY,"You know when everything is a closeup that you're dealing with a no-budget joke.  There is no redeeming quality to this.  Most death scenes just show a person go under the water with nary a sight of the cheesy, small shark.  The running time was somewhere between 45 and 50 minutes (thankfully actually) due to the long intro and the 16 minute ending credits.  Those who created this should be flayed.",1370304000,9,401,4.605633802816901
5553931,5,B00B2V65LY,"This campy masterpiece is called ""Jurassic Shark"" because ""Megalodon"" was already taken. An oil company doing illegal drilling has drilled too deep and has opened up a pocket. A Megalodon has been released into the lake. Some college girls looking to expose the illegal drilling get trapped on the island in the middle of the lake along with some other bad actors who are art thieves. The bad guys all wear black.

The shark is computer generated and can swim easily in a foot of water and pick off people standing on the beach. The sound track cheaply echoes when they are recording in a hallway. In one scene, one of the bad guys has a girl in front of him in his gun sight when he is hit from behind...and the girl shows up behind him a second later!

The special effects had me laughing out loud at this film that would make Ed Wood proud. The acting and editing were equally horrible.

Parental Guide: F-Bomb, no sex, no nudity. This is a terrible film that I greatly enjoyed because it was so bad. You might find it for free on line. 5 stars for all the wrong reasons.",1358640000,20,1074,4.36
5553932,5,B00B2V65LY,"The movie in question, which would be Jurassic Shark, is one of, if not, the best movie ever produced under this fair sun of ours. the acting is superb, the diolouge is amazing, you always are wondering what will happen next. it keeps you in great suspense through much of the duration of this phenomenal film. the special effects are beyond their time. i have never seen such photo-realism in a movie. before this one of course.i would recommend this movie to everyone. a must see, action packed, great cinematic thriller. 10/10. i wish i could give it more, but this is in fact amazon and they don't accept IGN ratings (i.e -111/9000, 11/10, etc etc) overall fantastic. i cannot possibly praise this film enough.",1514160000,,714,4.72
5553933,1,B00B2V65LY,Man can I say it was soooo fake. Saying I know it's not real but damn no effort at all in the shark department. This was a comedy because I laughed and laughed off this one.,1514073600,,173,3.8333333333333335
5553934,3,B00B2V65LY,"Not a ""B"" movie but a ""C"" movie.  The acting directing and editing was little better than something high school kids put together over a weekend.  The rest was funny and what wasn't funny was laughable.  The special effects were cheesy.  The whole premise of the movie lacked any reasonable continuity.  The reasons for the characters being on that lake are nonsensical.  But I did laugh throughout the movie.  Afterall movies are for entertainment.",1513900800,,449,4.986486486486487

Between the atrocious acting, terrible CGI, and the plot; Which made a minor amount of sense, if you tilt your head, look to your left, and close your eyes, all in one fluid motion. They at least got the horror part of the film down, because I will forever have nightmares about the abomination that this film is. That being said, it kept me entertained and wanting more, because I wanted to see the ridiculous plot points this film would uncover, or would fabricate be the word? On the bright side, I get an odd ego boost each time I think of this film, because at least I was not the person to make it.

The thing that surprised me was that this group of actors (or at least a part of them) have done other films together. I would have expected better timing when delivering their lines if they had worked together before.

The audio was spotty, there were parts where it's too low to where I have to crank the volume, then 5 seconds later, residents 5 counties away can hear the women SCREAM! The cgi shark looks like something done by a high school class. I watch bad movies on the regular, but THIS... horrendous is a compliment.",1514937600,,339,4.396825396825397

Over acting, under acting, even the shark eating was bad acting! Had to fast forward a LOT through the crap! Don't waste your time unless you want to just look at young women wearing bikinis before they get eaten.",1514851200,2,682,4.636363636363637
8561856,1,B00B2V65LY,Oh my god this movie was awful.  Canadian independent film.  I am embarrassed on behalf of all Canadians.  Do not watch without alcohol.,1514678400,,136,4.826086956521739
8561857,2,B00B2V65LY,"Not the worst film, BUT a really terrible movie! From the acting to damn near everything else. I just couldn't believe it was listed. I thought to myself, where were they going with the painting they stole? What was the value of the painting on the island? Lol. Anyways, I watched it to the end (of course I was occupied with many things, and not really watching) lol",1514678400,,367,4.411764705882353
8561858,1,B00B2V65LY,So bad I thought it was a very long intro to a bad porno.,1514592000,,57,3.142857142857143
8561859,1,B00B2V65LY,this was obviously filmed on an iPhone quality wasn't even good on a computer nice try tho,1514505600,,90,4.352941176470588
