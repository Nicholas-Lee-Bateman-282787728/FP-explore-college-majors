8420161,1,B004AFUJFM,"I had purchased this movie for a gift and on the day the gift was given to my daughter, we opened it and went to play it- but it would not play at all. The error message I kept receiving on my DVD player was that ""can not play due to regional code"".
So I paid for a movie set that we can't watch. At all. I'm very upset by this. My daughter was super excited about this movie and had been waiting for a long time to have it.
