8722934,5,B010Q3HQRK,"I wish reviewers would refrain from spouting their politics instead of simply judging movies and TV shows as entertainment.  Leave the political opinions for the real world where it matters.  ""American Odyssey"" was was just a TV series, not a propaganda piece as some reviewers seem to imagine.  And, as a TV series I found it first rate from beginning to end.  In many ways it was comparable to the Showtime series ""Homeland"" that got such rave reviews from critics (at least the first season).  I also think Anna Friel was amazing in her part.  She should have been nominated for an Emmy for her performance in AO; she was as good as anyone else I've seen lately.  Like any TV series the show had a few flaws, but the heart of the show was the story of the patriotic female soldier and her family and there it never faltered.

As for the reviewers who gave it one star because it did not comport with their political views, I think they should reconsider.  I  suggest they rewrite their reviews and rate the show as entertainment and not a political jihad.  Of course they are free to say they don't like what they see as left-wing politics, but again this was fantasy entertainment, not an election commercial.  I don't care what your politics are, there is simply no way this series deserves one star.  For those who have not seen it I highly recommend they do so.  It was an excellent TV series that deserved to be renewed.",1482537600,,1428,4.505836575875486

8722936,5,B010Q3HQRK,"Don't quite understand the 'fuss' here since this was a very well acted and filmed story about big business and big profits perpetrating and sustaining  the Military-Industrial machine. Actors did a bang up job. Locations were terrific and beautifully shot.  Having watched whole series it was great and so well done. The ending could have gone the usual way with 'big business' laughing all the way to the bank but for the courage of the whistleblowers who refused to give up even when they were threatened. In the end we got justice, well for a while until I guess another big corporation steps in to take the place of SOC so as to pay those big dividends to the shareholders yada yada yada... on the whole super exciting mystery thriller.  Well done Peter and Anna and the others who made it well worth the effort to continue watching all episodes. Absolutely LOVED it!",1467849600,,872,4.686274509803922
8722937,3,B010Q3HQRK,"because most of the story was told in the ""First"" season, it would've been too difficult to come up with 13 good stories.
Unlike the first reviewer I don't see such a ""left wing, pro Islam (implying that all Moslems are good, none bad) anti- war"" slant to the series. It's really more of an ""anti- evil big business war profiteering"" story that only briefly mentions the war, concerning itself much more with Odelle Ballard's discovery that an American Corporation is playing both sides for profit and their subsequent murderous attempts to protect their secret.
Islam is a big part of the story (which is, after all, set mostly in the Middle East) but all sides are represented. If anything ""American Odyssey"" is too hard on America, not on the Islamic world!
Beautifully filmed but unpleasant series, plenty to see in it.
Season One all 14 episodes.there were/are only 13, I have no idea where somebody got the 14 from.
No extras beyond subtitling (English only)
The DVD menu is pictographic, not written out
PAL format, not NTSC, so you'll need something that can play foreign DVDs .",1465862400,,1086,4.781914893617022
8722938,1,B010Q3HQRK,"American Odyssey, a recent Hollywood creation profiling death, murder, political and military intrigue was released late in the spring of 2015 and played on NBC for thirteen episodes from April 5- June 28th 2015. Currently you can see the entire season on Netflix.

The best I can say about this series is that Hollywood is once again trying to force feed their myopic left wing view on the rest of us slobs out there just trying to feed our families. Although the pilot episode centers around our efforts in North Africa to put down the rise of Islams Jihad designed to kill all those who won't submit, like you and me, they are not the real villain in this play. In fact, Jihad takes only a companion role and is relegated to a nameless, faceless entity so as not to steer you away from what they want you to see as the real problem.

There are several visions which the producers put into the story line to try an alter already common beliefs. Here are three of the main ones.

One, we learn quickly here that the villain is multinational corporations, like Bechtel and Halliburton, and their military enablers, backed up by a corrupt capitalist government, not the murderous terror that has gripped the Islamic world for the past 50 years. The arm of their chaos is their private contractors, in this case called Osela, (we never learn what the acronym stands for) who are hired to kill according to the companys directives. What drives this story is the murder of a Special Forces unit who targeted a known big fish terrorist and when viewing his computer files discover that he was being financed by these corporations.

Two, another Hollywood fantasy perpetrated in this story and it wouldnt be complete without it, is the role of Muslim terrorists in the United States and North Africa. Hollywoods answer, there really aren't any, or as Ben Affleck so famously said on Bill Maher in 2014, its only a few bad apples. All Muslim characters even if they are accused of terror it turns out are just good people trying to do the right thing and are wrongly accused of terrorism by the evil corporations, the United States military and by extension its government that is in bed with them.

Even the Imam of the New York Mosque harboring some of these guys comes off as a sympathetic character. Just a humble Muslim trying to live a good life now in America and just wants freedom like all of us.

Right!

These are the same guys that harangue in the mosques every Friday to overthrow American decadency in favor of Sharia law, and create a true Muslim America. His wife even has a private alone conversation with one our intrepid heroes meeting him behind a back door in an alley. Islam forbids its women to talk to men they don't know without permission. She risks a severe beating from her husband, or worse, which doesnt happen. She actually tells her husband of the encounter and how scared she was. And, he comforts her and defends her on it. Does that sound like the Islam that you know?

And three, the obligatory gay character so unbelievable you would have to be a fool if you didn't question its existence. A transgender plays a good guy role living an open gay lifestyle in a society that is 90% Muslim. Not only that but he is the star of Malian TV show, which he apparently even has a big Malian general as a lover. Murdered not because he was a man dressed as a woman in radical Muslim society ruled by al Queda, Ansar al-dine and smaller radical groups similar to Boko Haram but by our big corporation bad guys for not giving the ""Osela"" heavy information that he wanted.

Absolutely absurd, even for the dreaming Hollywood fantasy world.

Obviously created out of a world that satisfies this left wing ethos, the producers and writers attempt to see their left wing, politically correct America hating dreams actually come true, that the one percenters are the ones causing all the trouble in the world. Are they?

Of course, you would never know this by watching shows like American Odyssey. To say multinationals never break the law is nave, but to suggest that they would actually get in bed with an evil like that which is spreading across the world of Islam and kill American soldiers over it is far reaching even for the Hollywood left.

There are three simultaneous story lines all moving in the same direction. One, is Odelle Ballard played by Anna Friel. She is one of the soldiers of the unit wiped out by the contractors in Mali. Ballard survives and fights through her odyssey to get back to her family, her country and to expose the proof that she has that SOC, the pseudonym Becthtel Corporation bad guy, was in business with terrorists.

Two, Peter Decker, played by Peter Facinaelli, former US attorney now working for SOC but wants to solve the crime of SOCs involvement with terrorists. And three, Harrison Walters, played by Jake Robinson, a political activist, Occupy Wall Street type gets hold of some information and will not let it go. His tenacious personality probably inherited from his investigative writer father drives him to find Odelle Ballard. He convinces his estranged father that he might be onto something by insisting she is alive. And, when dad gets too close he is murdered for it, increasing the younger Harrisons zeal and courage to get to the bottom of it.

The fact that one of our main heroes is a Wall Street occupier type has to say something to our audience watching the show. Big corporations bad, small hippie protesters good.

You can see where the three parallel lines are coming closer to one another in a race to discover the truth. Actually before the end of the season the two stories that take place in Washington and New York, Decker and Harrison Walters actually do meet briefly leaving the impression that they will at some point combine forces to fight the evil corporations wreaking havoc in the rest of the world. Our three intrepid dogged heroes don't allow anything to step in the way of the truth.

In conclusion, this show is even more overt than others that the Hollywood left wing agenda has tried to spread through the English speaking world. So much so it is almost laughable how hard Hollywood is trying to change the way we think. Maybe it was fitting that American Odyssey was cancelled after one season because of low ratings. Thats a good thing, believe me.",1461283200,2,6351,4.652096342551293
