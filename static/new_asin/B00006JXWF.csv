7970702,1,B00006JXWF,"Unfortunately, I ordered this dvd before I read some of the reviews on it. Being that there was another review that started that the sound dropped in the first 10 minutes of the dvd and never came back on, it sounds like this is a major problem with the product.

Even without the sound problem this had to be one of the worst documentories I have ever seen in my life. It was cheap and the presentation was not worth the high price tag. I felt the presentation in the documentary ""Samurai - The Last Warriors"" was much better and more informative.",1154736000,3,548,4.372549019607843
7970703,5,B00006JXWF,"If you are interested in Samurai ethics this is DVD for you. I found it very informative and enjoyable to watch. When I checked out jsanfords other reviews I noticed he only gives bad reviews to products, so I discounted his review and purchased the DVD anyway. I am glad I did!! You will learn a lot.",1138924800,,301,4.298245614035087
7970704,4,B00006JXWF,The knowledge I received regarding the Samurai is fascinating.  Such an interesting culture and DVD to boot.,1131926400,,108,5.352941176470588
7970705,1,B00006JXWF,"I bought what must have been the first volume of Mr. Phd's series on samurai and was enraged at the incredibly low quality of the documentary. Judging from most of the reviews that I've read of this one, he hasn't improved. I figure the 2 positive reviews were either written by Mr. Alexander himself, or his mom, or possibly his nephew.  This guy must be stopped. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT HE IS EVEN REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH!!!",1098230400,2,428,4.558441558441558
7970706,1,B00006JXWF,"This dvd features  bad lighting, bad sound,  bad editing and a rambling, pompous, repellant incoherent host. What more could you want? Not to mention that the sound (what there is of it) drops out permanently after 5 minutes. How did this guy get a Phd anyway? He must have found a blank Phd certificate while dumpster diving behind his local University looking for used porn. Then, once he ascertained what it was,(I figure he can at least recognize the letters  P,H and D) he found someone who could write, and agreed to do some yard work for them if they would just write his name in the blanks.

  What a waste!!!",1098144000,13,617,4.513513513513513
7970707,5,B00006JXWF,"I'm really into Samurai history & martial arts that have swords as the
primary weapon of use and if you want to know about the Samurai and his
culture, buy this DVD, it's worth every penny.  This video is the bomb.",1089158400,,214,4.219512195121951
7970708,5,B00006JXWF,I found this a very informative and interesting documentry on  the Samurai code of honor. This excellent production helped me to understand the roots of my own Japanese Martial Arts training. It gave me much to think about and I believe made me a better more determined student of the martail arts . I highly recommend this production.,1086220800,,335,4.775862068965517
7970709,1,B00006JXWF,"This DVD does not live up to it's description.  The entire video is comprised of a guy in a very ugly shirt standing in front of a temple 'talking' mostly about the history of the Samurai. Toward the end of the video, it loses voice sync. It is really, really bad.  It appears that the guy set up a video camera and filmed himself talking then decided to make a buck off of it. I only hope that Amazon will let me return this sad excuse of a video.",1080691200,2,448,4.022471910112359
7970710,3,B00006JXWF,"Low budget production of basic samurai info.  They didn't spend any money getting video footages-there aren't any!  But as far as what he talks about, he is correct so this DVD might be of interest for beginning martial artist in bushijitsu or kendo, but for people who already know the basics there really isn't anything to offset its price.",1061596800,7,342,4.779661016949152
