8671125,5,B00MALECMO,"This is just as good as the Blu-Ray version, as it's got the same English Dub by Animax as well as the Blu-Ray version, and it's at a cheaper price.

So if you want to see Animax's English Dub of CardCaptor Sakura, but can't afford the Blu-Ray edition, then NIS America's 3 DVD Set's are the ones for you. :)",1412726400,3,308,4.133333333333334
