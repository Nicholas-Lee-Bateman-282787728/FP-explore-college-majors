I originally got this on Laserdisc back in 1991. The Laserdisc, however, had footage from another concert too, which this DVD does not. Some of that footage is up on Youtube. I am happy with this DVD being in my collection, though.

2797617,4,B0000W3QS6,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed/written by Ted Geoghegan, We Are Still Here is about an aging couple (Andrew Sensenig & Barbara Crampton) who move to the quiet New York countryside after the death of their college-age son. Unfortunately, their fixer-upper is haunted by malevolent ghosts. Monte Markham & Connie Neer play their weird neighbors, the latter secretly warning them to GET OUT. Lisa Marie plays a medium friend of the couple and Larry Fessenden her stoner husband.

Older haunted house movies turned me off to the genre, like the lame ""House on Haunted Hill (1959) and the better-but-dull The Legend of Hell House (1973); even 1999s The Haunting was relatively uninteresting (except the quality cast). The effective remake of The Amityville Horror (2005) changed my mind, along with films like The Grudge 2 (2006). We Are Still Here is another quality movie in the genre. The film wisely takes its time to set up the mysterious ambiance, the protagonists and their situation while slowly building up suspense before all hell literally breaks loose. The possession sequence is particularly well done.

THE MOVIE RUNS 84 minutes and was shot Palmyra & Shortsville, New York. ADDITIONAL CAST: Michael Patrick Nicholson & Kelsea Dakota play the college couple who visit the house and Marvin Patterson appears as the electrician.

Unfortunately, in true horror movie fashion, their new house has a deadly history. The movie shows its hand a bit too early, it has a familiar setup and it employs many familiar tropes such as seemingly friendly neighbors, suspicious townsfolk and one I will not mention here that you will gasp at for still being a thing. All the same, I still recommend it for going in a direction I did not totally expect and for not shirking on the blood and viscera. I also give it credit for its strong direction, particularly in the atmosphere and sense of place departments.",1502323200,,730,4.666666666666667

My main issue, I don't like the male lead character; needs to improve his acting. That said, the movie is a rather unique take on a haunted house, with the 'comedy act' of the husband of the main character's friend. I call him that, but don't take it as meaning he was funny even a bit. Would I watch it again? Probably to read the newspaper articles, which although fake seem really real.

We know two things almost immediately: Thing #1- The Sacchettis lost their son at some point in the recent past. Thing #2- Their new home just might have some issues... of the otherworldly kind! Soon, odd occurrences begin, and the Sacchettis hear from neighbors about the rather dark history of their new abode. After an electrician is injured in a  bizarre ""accident"", Anne's friends, May and Jacob Lewis (Lisa Marie! and Larry Fessenden!) arrive. May is a psychic / medium, and has come to get to the bottom of whatever is happening. Not surprisingly, nothing is as it appears, and horror quickly explodes into death! As ghost stories go, this one is a grabber! Ms. Crampton is excellent as always, as are the rest of the cast. Special mention must be made of Monte Markham as the perfectly sinister Dave McCabe! If you enjoy retro-style, throwback spookers like Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, then this one should be a gruesome delight!

2797628,1,B0000W3QS6,"Ok this movie is hilarious.  It's like a 5th grader wrote a movie and picked all the actors (the actors are terrible), but somehow pulled it off enough to look like a real movie. I think critics got together and said ""hey, let's see how many people we can get to watch this movie by giving it a high score on Rotten Tomatoes.""

First, the whole movie makes absolutely no sense.  We have no idea why anyone is haunting anyone else or why the towns people are so evil.  At one point, the main bad guy from the town walks into a restaurant and shoots a nameless waitress dead for absolutely no reason, then proceeds to walk into the restaurant with his wife, and has a conversation with the bartender.  Why did he kill the waitress? Absolutely no idea.  The bartender doesn't even ask.  They don't even attempt to offer an explanation.  It's like a little kid wrote a movie and has the someone shoot a random person as he walks into the room, just so you're 100% sure he's the bad guy.

The movie is at this perfect level of awfulness that makes it hilarious, while not making it unbearable to watch.  Tha this movie has 95% absolutely blows my mind.",1497225600,,1147,4.367924528301887

I do think that they could have gone into a bit more detail about the ghostly characters and explored the plotline further, giving more back story and detail than they did. And they definitely could have better explained the ""friendly old neighbor's"" involvement in the whole ordeal but it's definitely worth a watch.

2797639,4,B0000W3QS6,"I saw this originally on Another Streaming Site and I was really excited that this is basically a period piece, directed in the way movies from the 70's were.  I've been dying for a horror movie that is this sort of macabre, soundtrack-less creeper.  It combines a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense when following the conventional haunting ideas (for instance: the room where most of the activity seems to emanate from is hot, rather than ice cold.)  The quiet brutality of the deaths, combined with the showdown at the almost confusing, open-ended conclusion was sort of relieving.  This movie was a great throw-back to what a lot of people these days would consider slow-moving, almost boring retro garbage.  But it's not.

Don't watch this if you're not patient, or you're into huge special effects and M. Night Shyamalan plot twists.",1484179200,,840,4.880281690140845

2797652,3,B0000W3QS6,"This movie has a real lo-fi look to it. The actors are all a bit rough around the edges and overall, for most of the movie there is a slightly amateurish feel to it. Now, that can work really in the horror genre but here I feel like it was kind of wasted.

The reason I say that is that the kind of creepy 70s vibe of the movie at the end turns to the kind of comically over-the-top gore fest that seemed more prevalent in the 80s. Its a real shift in vibe and perspective and it just doesn't work.

But even beyond that, the number one problem I had with this film is about something else.

Eventually we see the ghosts. And they look so dang good. SO. GOOD. The design is so, so great. They look monstrous but also still human and the added effects give them a dreamy, otherworldly effect. It's just great. Then they have them goofily kill a bunch of people. It's such a waste!! Those ghosts belonged in a much smarter movie- one with a psychological element that would have befitted how sad/angry they looked at the end. But this ain't that movie.",1471996800,,1050,4.24

It will never fail to give you the creeps and is top notch entertainment for the horror buff. I did not quite understand some things about the movie like why the family ended up the way they did (I'm not saying for fear I may be giving up the plot).

2797683,3,B0000W3QS6,"Let me start with the pros.  The film is interesting.  There is a bit of a twist at the end.  The ghosts are well done, that is the make up is great.  The film starts off with some scares.  The acting is better than The SciFi Channel.  But still horror movie quality.

Die hard horror fans will see some familiar faces.

That said.

A friend who studied film told me about the B roll and B footage.  This is footage of a car on the highway, a house, a neighborhood.  Basically incidentals and scenery. This movie is about 50% B roll.  I found myself screaming as I watched it.  Not in fear.  I was screaming ""Yes!  I get it!  The house is in a remote area and it is snowing!  MOVE ON!""

Next is a ham handed Jack Nicholson from the Shining impersonator.  Supposed to be a hippy but comes across like that Uncle you only see once a year at a picnic who makes everyone uncomfortable.

Then there is Lisa Maria.  Not Presly.  Look her up.  Her performance never finds it's mark.  Either she did not realize she was supposed to be upset or she needs to back off the botox.  Her lips look like she has two nasty cold sores getting ready to bloom.

About half way through you realize this is taking place in the 70's.  You learn why if you watch the bonus features which explains the director was trying to create a 70's style horror.

The lighting was never moody enough.

At least twice you find yourself saying ""Wait, what?""

It was expected to utilize several of the typical supernatural horror cliches, but they tend to feel forced and often are employed at seemingly random and inopportune times throughout the film. The story itself is likewise not all that inspiring, the whole project feels rushed, and the history & motivations revolving around the ""haunted curse"" are unconvincing and mediocre at best.

What actually happened to the original family that lived in the house so long ago. It left me with a lot more questions than answers.

2797705,4,B0000W3QS6,"Sick of generic CGI-heavy,teen-model laden Netflix horror fare? If so check out We Are Still Here, a pleasant throwback to the genre pics of yesteryear. Director Ted Geoghegan wears his influences on his sleeve, but when those influences are names like Fulci and Carpenter who are we to argue? When the Sacchettis (the better half portrayed by an almost-unrecognizable genre goddess Barbara Crampton), a grieving 1970s couple who has recently lost their only son, move into an old rural farm house we see from the get-go that things are about to go from bad to worse. A creepy old house, a mysterious presence in the basement, townspeople who know more than they're letting on....you see where this is going. What sets this film apart from the pack is the talented cast, including veteran actors Crampton, Lisa Marie, genre auteur Larry Fessenden (looking and acting like a poor man's Jack Nicholson) and TV stalwart Monte Markham who give the economically-lensed film a gravity that transcends its limited budget. The dread builds throughout as the mystery of the house and its former/current inhabitants unravels and the film explodes in a bloody but relatively satisfying finale. The plot doesn't hold up to intense scrutiny (I'll exclude details due to the spoiler factor but I think most will agree) like most low-budget horror but overall this is worth a watch and for $8 it is a worthy addition to the Blu-ray library. Now if only someone would release this on the format it is begging to be seen on - VHS (Mondo, we're looking at you....)",1456185600,,1546,4.904580152671755

The good: With the exception of two of the younger actors, the cast is solid. The setting is superb for a horror movie: isolated, snowy and windy, stark. The outdoor cinematography is beautiful - hats off to the DP. The make-up and subtle sounds effects in relation to the ghosts is also really fantastic.

The not so good: The movie, to my mind, can't quite decide what kind of horror flick it wants to be. It lurches from being a creepy ghost flick, to being a zombie / monster flick, to being a gross out flick, to a possession flick, then moments of humor toward the end which seem completely out of place, as though the filmmakers suddenly decided they wanted to throw in some Sam Raimi for good measure. Furthermore, the plot begins to unfold like one that we've seen too many times, despite one of the producer's claims (in the extras) that they wanted to do something different from your average haunted house movie.

I would say for fans of horror movies, the good aspects I mentioned make it worth a look. It is not, however, one that I will add to my DVD collection, nor one I will feel inclined to watch a second time, as I do my favs.",1452902400,5,1206,4.327433628318584

The cast led by Barbara Crampton (as Anne), Andrew Sensenig (as Paul), Larry Fessender (as Jacob) & Lisa Marie (as May) is pretty good. The directing, story & screenplay by Ted Geoghegan is pretty good.

The music by Wojciech Golczewski is pretty good. The cinematography by Karim Hussain is pretty good. The film editing by Aaron Crozier & Josh Ethier is pretty good. The production design by Marcella Brennan is pretty good. The art direction by Sean Hughes is pretty good. The costume design by John C. Houston is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Cat Bernier & supervised by Marcus Koch is pretty good. The sound design by Ryan Gegenheimer and mixed by Mano Guha & Michael McFadden is pretty good. The make-up effects by Alexandra Marsh is pretty good.

This is a pretty good thriller that is well-made and well-done. Ted Geoghegan has made a solidly crafted directorial debut. Barbara Crampton is pretty good as Anne and also leads a solidly-rounded cast. This is one of the better suspense horror thrillers of the year (also one of the better ones of the recently done summer season, as well, too), so far.",1447027200,,1780,4.6265822784810124

2797775,2,B0000W3QS6,"Let me start by saying I was suckered in by two things; the cover art and critics rating on rotten tomatoes. Neither were acurate for the absolute gore fest I entered unknowingly. The story is simple, and quite honestly lacks any originality, character depth, true terror, or any new type of haunted house substance except trying to shoe horn extreme violence into it. It involves a married couple who moves out into the country side after the death of their son. The woman believes the entities in the house are her son and call in a friend who is a psychic to find out if it is the son or not. There's more about the house and town that I won't spoil, but that's the main gist of it. Now I will admit there are some good, chilling scares at the beginning. Really cool ghosts that we haven't really seen before. Aside from this, everything else is either average or below. The writing was cheesy, the acting stiff and forced, the violence over the top, and above all, the same subtle haunted house bulls*** that's been done time and time again. Their favorite, pictures falling and breaking. We've seen it a million times before, and it's done so many times in this film, it's naseuating. In moderation it's tolerable but in this it just doesn't work, and in this day and age it's time to drop some of the old horror tropes if you aren't going for the old school campy feel. A lot of praise for the atmosphere from a lot of sources, and I gotta say I wasn't truly impressed. It was fitting, but not really noticeable. The movie sets itself up as an old school haunted house movie and ends as a gore hounds wet dream. I can't emphasize enough just how over the top the violence is in this movie. It doesn't mesh well with the feel it's going for, so the signals get mixed and we're left wondering; is this meant to be chilling or exploitive? I gotta say, both just don't work. At least not in this overhyped pool of bloody ghost mayhem. If you're looking for a 70's setting gore fest that happen to include ghost, your dream come true. For those looking for a mature, unsettling, intense, and clever haunted house film like we are promised, you'll be sorely disappointed.",1444953600,15,2171,4.457286432160804

I saw and ""felt"" (by that I mean atmosphere and a sense of dread) tones of the original ""The Fog"" and ""Phantasm"" in this little gem.  Not to mention ""House by The Cemetery"" which is mentioned often in the extras.  This is clearly made by people who love horror and wanted to pay it its due respect.  The real star of this film is the cinematography and lighting.  Absolutely beautiful but very somber and lonely.  The ghosts are quite scary and reminded me of Blake and his merry bunch of doomed lepers in The Fog.  This film (like Phantasm) perfectly captures the easy going nature of the 70s and early 80s.  The one draw back to this film, if at all, is Lisa Marie's atrocious acting.  It's really...... really bad.  Additionally I found myself so fixated on her overblown up lips that I missed half of her poorly delivered dialogue.  In the end, this is worth adding to your collection if you liked the previously mentioned films and maybe, ""Rosemary's baby"" ""The Omen"" and ""Burnt Offerings"".  Stay spooky.

Some creepy moments also to be had. Basic story is a family movies into a new house where the town is hiding a secret. As the past starts to come to light strange things happen in the house & too the people in it. The acting was good, the storyline was very good, easy to follow & once things started coming to light I really enjoyed it. The effects I felt were also very good, especially towards the end when there is some great gore effects. The only thing id change is maybe make it a bit longer since it only runs a little over 80 mins. Special features include commentary, behind the scenes & trailers.

The description made this independent film seem pretty enticing; a grieving wife and mother and her husband hole up in an abandoned mortuary that is now a house(never a good idea) so that she may lick her wounds from the death of her son. The movie has a very grainy 70's early 80's feel to it although it never mentions a time that the story takes place. What we are treated to is wide angle shots of the house and the snow, and a birdhouse twisting in the wind and boring shots of the interior of the house and lots of ambient sounds cranked to 11. Pictures fall, people talk a lot and charred figures with white eyes start showing up in the basement and around the house. What we find out from more than a few stock eccentric townsfolk is that for some idiotic reason this house needs to feed every 30 years and if the demons are not appeased it brings death and destruction to the town. during the last 1/2 hour the movie kicks it into gear with the bloodshed but nothing that happens makes much sense and the movie has a big non ending.

This movie has a lot going for it. It's got a strong cast playing interesting characters, a couple of really creepy settings in which to shoot, and some absolutely killer makeup and special effects. The directing at times is extremely canny, with some really cleverly-timed now-you-see-him-now-you-don't shots.

But it doesn't click. For the first third of the film, I was bored. During the third third, I was revolted at the gratuitous gore. That left one third of a film that was pretty good.

I blame the shortcomings primarily on the script, which was poor. And what's really annoying is that it seemed like the writer has talent, but was just going through the motions. There were places where things should have happened---and if the writer had given the story any thought, he would have made them happen---but it felt like the writer was too lazy. This results in a lot of confusion for most of the film followed by an implausible info-dump toward the end. Honestly, even after the info dump, I still didn't quite get it.

I genuinely would like to see the next film this team makes.

2797863,5,B0000W3QS6,"The story that Geoghegan, along with Richard Griffin, creates is a melancholic blend of casual attitude, and sobering horror. There is no overstated approach to building the paranormal aspects of ""We Are Still Here"", or that all too familiar ""your so dumb that I am telling you the scary part is coming"" staging. The almost comfortable character interactions and dialog seem to echo the the loss and sorrow that the two main characters feel in the story, which create a relaxed viewing experience so when the suspense leads into the scares, they often are pretty scary. The acting and situations don't feel contrived or forced.

""We Are Still Here"" does have an extra slice of the macabre with an ""American Gothic""/""Twin Peaks"" type of community that surrounds the country home with a dark, historical back story. Evil people do evil things when faced with evil. That is all I will say about that part of the story. Anyway it takes the paranormal, ghost story to another level of nightmare that doesn't happen often in films about haunting. Plus it begs for a sequel, and further exploration into the house's history and the evil within.

The special effects are pretty well thought out and executed. There are elements that pull from classic horror, which considering that ""We Are Still Here"" is a period piece set in the 70's, just helps create that creepy atmosphere that classic horror films seemed to have, that modern films often fall flat when trying to tap into. The creature effects are cringe worthy, and the chills are definitely effective. Actually if some of the cast weren't so recognizable, you would forget that this is a recent film, and think that you ran across good old horror from way back when! It is quite surprising just how well the production value, set design, and attention to detail ""We Are Still Here"" contains.

2797866,4,B0000W3QS6,"A word of warning: Lucio Fulci is one of my cinematic heroes, and I will be mentioning him a lot in this review.

When a friend told me that Fulci's HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY had been re-imagined, I can't say I was all that excited about it. But I was anxious to see the final results. And now, I am happy to report that WE ARE STILL HERE is not only a very enjoyable film, but also a loving (and gory!) homage to The Maestro.

It is NOT a remake of HbtC, and for that, I am thankful. There are already too many terrible horror remakes in the world, thank you very much. No, WE ARE STILL HERE is its own movie. It's not as hazy or as dream-like (or nightmare-like) as a Fulci film. Perhaps it is a bit more focused (both visually and thematically), as well. It definitely has a more by-the-numbers horror movie plot than any Fulci movie I can think of. But that's okay. In truth, many of Fulci's horror films could have done with a little more coherence, and a LOT more plot/character development. But then, they wouldn't have been Fulci movies! Luckily, WE ARE STILL HERE shares enough plot points, in-jokes, and visual cues (hold onto your eyeballs!) with other Fulci flicks to keep fans happy.

I don't know what kind of budget the filmmakers had to work with, but the movie looks good, most of the performances are strong, and the gore is especially well-done. WE ARE STILL HERE starts out spooky, but gets a little silly about halfway through (personally, I found the seance scene laughable). But the climax is big and bloody, and the ending is quiet, and surprisingly poignant.

All in all, I believe fans of Lucio Fulci will be pleased with WE ARE STILL HERE. In fact, I believe horror fans in general should give it a go. The cast and crew have not only made a solid horror movie, they've also done a great service to The Maestro's cinematic legacy.

The acting was OK. The Script was OK. The Direction was OK. Just about everything in this film was OK except the Post Production Sound (Which matters BTW!). BUT, would I ride a roller coaster that's just OK? Ya, I would. I don't always want to ride the roller coaster ride that's going to add hair to my scalp every time. The being able to ride different rides is just fine with me. Helps me be able to have a lunch and keep it down. Now, do I LOVE the very best roller coaster rides? YUP!!! Every time!!! Would I rather ride the very best Roller Coaster rides? YUP!!! Every time!!! But, do I have to do this? Well, my personality says no. My mind says yes, but an overall picture of me would have to say no, I do not need to ride the Best Coaster all the time. Some people do need that. I say all of this because that's what Horror Movies are to me, IE: thrill rides. Done well, they're tons of fun. But is anything in this world done well ALL of the time? NOPE as anyone would agree. BUT, does/do things evolve so that a Roller Coaster can be created better and better as days/months/years/ go on? Yup!!! And I'm sure most if not all would agree with this as well. So, thus my leniency for this film and my review of it. It was not awful as I could see someone saying it was. It just wasn't great and I can easily see how just isn't great is awful to many people in whatever genre of film they're watching. So, my reviews, when I do them will be adjusted accordingly, IE; to the general themes, people and so on. Not to the specific people who want what they want and want it now and cruelly review films based on than want rather than an overall picture (No pun intended) of what a film is trying to do for its audience.

The film began beautifully, setting a perfect mood for a haunted house-style film of yesteryear. Unfortunately actors who had to recite dialog. That's when the film initially showed it's amateurish colors. Using unknowns is something of which I've always been a fan. For example, Blue Ruin is a perfect example of unknowns hitting it out of the park, and a director who knows how to elicit the best from his performers. We Are Still Here either used actors who were simply below par for the demands of their roles, or the director was below par in understanding how to get the most out of his cast. I'm guessing it's a mixture of both. The performance of a possessed Larry Fessenden in the second act was especially embarrassing, and I normally dig Fessenden.

By the time the ridiculously out of place third act finally came around, and the goofy ghosts began exacting their bloody revenge upon the townsfolk (in unintentionally humorous methods), I was so hands-in-the-air exasperated I couldn't even work up a snicker at the amateur nature of it all.

Yup. I paid for this. Here's hoping my money goes to a future endeavor from the writer/director where he matures far beyond the disappointment of this work. Nice try, but no cigar here.",1433721600,15,1508,4.814671814671815
2797888,5,B0000W3QS6,"We Are Still Here is in many ways a horror fans dream, and Ive been following its high praise for some time. Are the glowing reviews accurate or just hype? Apart from one critique, Id have to agree that WASH was beautifully filmed, poignantly acted, oddly humorous, and fairly horrific. It struck just the right note, that balance of art house and classic haunted house genre styling. All four leads were pitch perfect, especially Crampton. The cinematography was poetic. The dread palpable. The atmosphere claustrophobic. The tension slow to build until exploding into a frenzy of unthinkable gore. Every piece fit, even the rather beautiful, totally surprising, emotional ending. There is real heart here, and horror.

I keep reading the phrase Fulci homage, and I can see that. Personally, I was reminded of Lovecraftian lorethat small town with a big, supernatural secret they will do anything to protect. Rarely is blame placed in Lovecrafts stories, or in WASH. All motivations are understandable, even when their consequences are dire. I truly love this element. But it does connect to my one critique of the film. Though I don't want everything spelled out for me, the film could have used perhaps 10 more minutes to really explore the townsfolk and the unique mythos theyve created. Without spoiling anything, two fringe characters are murdered to no real purpose, there is a violent mob whose motivations could have been touched upon better, and all-in-all the side characters could have used a bit more life. Well-acted, yes, but they felt a bit like shells of characters. Not asking for Cthulhu here, but WASHs mythos deserved more screen time.

Otherwise, Id consider this a perfect horror film, and one I look forward to watching again.",1433721600,,1750,5.051903114186851

It started off well. American country roads. Silence. Winter, snow. Then, silence and few movements.

Then, the main two characters, a couple who are seemingly deeply affected, start talking. Neither of the actors do a good job, I'm sad to say. The script is forced and the dialogue feels contrived. The plot moves along at a bore's pace, and the more everything goes on, I felt a complete blanket of amateurism crudely laid over the entire production.

I could go on with how the twists and turns in this film don't feel relevant, or how I never felt any kind of care for anything in this production, but that would just be giving this machine more than it deserves. Stay away.",1433635200,9,868,4.697368421052632
2797892,4,B0000W3QS6,"Truly scary, well-paced, some funny stuff--great homage to old school haunted house flicks. You will have to overlook some of the effects towards the end, but that's easily forgiven. This guy has talent. Looking forward to his next movie!",1433548800,,238,5.128205128205129
2797893,4,B0000W3QS6,"""We Are Still Here"" is probably more than just a little bit inspired by Fulci's ""The House by the Cemetery"". It's maybe more coherent...and maybe not? I'm honestly not sure and I've seen this movie three times already. I suppose that means it's an effective homage to Fulci, since none of his movies really ever made much sense. What they always achieved, for me at least, was an overwhelming sense of dread with a little bit of style. This movie has that down just fine. It's weird and uncomfortable from the very first minute, starting with the barren winter landscape and the drab and depressing house with it's stained walls and unfinished floors. The early 80s' time-frame helps a lot. If this movie was a wall it would be dated wood paneling and it would smell like smoke. Does that make any sense? That's what it makes me think of. The characters are all appropriately bizarre, as well, including the leading couple. If the movie didn't so successfully achieve it's dreadful mood, I'm not sure I would have liked it as much. The plot is paper thin, has it's share of holes, and it's devoid of the usual (extreme) gore you'd find in a Fulci film...though it has it's share of bloodshed. Regardless, it still seems to work as a successful homage. Everything about it seems intentional, even the parts that are messy and don't make much sense or seem overly familiar and unoriginal. It's a successful throwback in my opinion, and so few of these attempts *are* successful. It's also reasonably scary and that's worth a thumbs up, right there. Unfortunately, these types of films are never really acknowledged by the mainstream. It's sad, because this is much better than the vast majority of wide release horror. I really look forward to seeing what this director and the production team put out in the future.",1433548800,11,1814,4.743670886075949

2797895,1,B0000W3QS6,"I purchased this movie sight unseen because of all of the glowing and positive reviews and publicity. What a mistake I made. This is total junk... The film has a late 1970's, early 1980's look to it; but the plot is thinner than old timers like Blood Beach and Silent Scream. The script is like a poorly done jigsaw puzzle, with pieces missing. The effects are nothing to write home about and their was not one real scare or creepy moment in the whole movie. Honestly, to me, this was nothing more than a Swiss cheese story that was set up to have a sequel that is a prequel that will fill us in on why all this happened. I have seen episodes of the Goosebumps tv show that were scarier than this, and that is no joke. Viewer beware, your in for NO scare. I'm not grasping the concept as to why so many people are raving about this movie. Could it be that the horror genre has suffered so badly of late, that this flop of a film with a nostalgic feel has conned the desperate horror fan into thinking it was something it is not? The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that this is the case. Yes, they are still here, in my movie collection... but I wish they weren't!",1433548800,14,1179,4.175438596491228
2797896,3,B0000W3QS6,"Extremely uneven horror movie about a middle aged couple who move to a house in the country several months after the death of their son in a car accident.  The wife Anne (Barbara Crampton) is convinced that she feels the spirit of their dead son in the house but husband Paul (Andrew Sensenig) is skeptical.  What they don't know is every 30 years the town moves an unsuspecting family into the house as a sacrifice to sate appetite of the evil inside and stop it from reaching out and striking at the rest of the town.

We Are Still Here is a mess in terms of both storytelling and tone.  Writer/director Ted Geoghegan never seems to get a handle on what kind of movie he is trying to make or what it is that's actually going on.  At times We Are Still Here feels very much like Lucio Fulci style haunted house horror (The House By the Cemetery; The Beyond) with vengeful spirits that kill in unusually physical ways for ghosts--but why is the gore and violence so tame?  We Are Still Here turns out to be an underwhelming horror movie with way too much talk and not enough scares that doesn't do nearly enough with the ideas that it has.

When some townspeople make the mistake of descending on the house to make sure the couple doesn't make it out alive We Are Still Here seems to turn into a completely different movie altogether--one finally filled with the gory deaths we were denied for most of the movie but, strangely, the couple who were the intended sacrifice are spared.  The movie never comes up with an adequate explanation for why the house doesn't want to kill that particular couple but is more than happy to knock off their friends--or for why people living in a tiny cursed town in the middle of nowhere wouldn't simply move away rather than sacrifice a family every 30 years--or for why a waitress is murdered for simply answering the door.

Eventually friends of the family who are involved with hauntings and psychic phenomenon turn up to spend the weekend-- May (Lisa Marie) immediately senses the evil throughout the house but misses something obvious and personal.  Her hippie husband Jacob (the always welcome Larry Fessenden) doesn't have his wife's gifts but is definitely a believer.  When the couple are eating in the only bar/restaurant in town with all of the customers gaping at them the waitress overhears the psychic lady trying to talk her friends into leaving, which panics the townspeople into taking matters into their own hands.  The reason the townspeople panic doesn't become clear until the movie is nearly over which feels like a pretty big wasted storytelling opportunity.

We Are Still Here manages a small handful of cheap shocks but generates no suspense between them.  It also inexplicably ignores one character (an electrician) who survives whatever is in the basement and then completely disappears from the film even though he could have provided important clues regarding what's in the house or, at the very least, tried to warn the couple to leave which the people in town would want to prevent--yet another wasted story opportunity.

A third act scene where Paul and Jacob perform an impromptu seance while their wives run to town to buy groceries is played for laughs unlike nearly every other scene in the movie, squandering an excellent set-up for an Evil Dead style freak-out.  It's possible that writer/director Ted Geoghegan thought he was making a more sophisticated horror movie (like the ones written and directed by costar Larry Fessenden) by keeping a tight reigns on his film's violence and shock effects but his writing isn't smart enough to sustain the movie so all he ends up doing is preventing We Are Still Here from ever being much fun.  Maybe writer/director Ted Geoghegan will get it right next time but We Are Still Here feels very much like the work of a first-time director--it's not really good enough to recommend but if you are in the mood for a horror movie there are worst ways to spend an hour and a half.",1433462400,3,3989,4.72478386167147

2797899,3,B0000W3QS6,"On par with a movie like HOUSE OF THE DEVIL pacing wise, this low budget movie is shot well, with an ominous, detached chill hanging over the precedings. I have to say Barbara Crampton was pretty great, but I still feel the script could have given every character a lot more to do, especially the human villians, who simply don't get the chance to really participate in the conspiracy of the house the way a good thriller like Rosemary's Baby does. It's as if the characters have no chance to really interact with one another in a way that propels the plot or makes it more engaging. So although the first hour of the movie has an evocative mood, a couple of minor scary reveals, and good performances by the the main 4 leads, overall you might be a little frustrated watching. There are are few non-sensical, disjointed howlers - the kinds of scenes where you wonder how lazy the script writer is. What happens to the electrician? Why must the waitress from the bar die? Why is the character of Kat killed? None of these horror ""shocks"" have anything to do with what's happening. Like House of the Devil, there is payoff at the end, which is both visceral and exciting, starting with a very well scripted seance that goes bonkers. However, I think the story of the deceased son and the final coda is a little muddled and confusing. Some reviews of this movie compared it to Luci Fulci, but I didn't think it compares to the nightmarish or freakish quality of his films. It's worth watching if you are a horror fan. But if you've actually seen a lot of horror films, you might be a tad underwhelmed. The monsters/ghosts are GREAT, though. Amazon's star rating system is a little too neutral for me. *** means ""it's okay"" - and this movie is much better than just okay. But I couldn't bring myself to rate it **** which means ""I like it,"" because to me 4 stars for a movie means I'd probably watch it again, or maybe buy it on DVD and that wasn't the case for me here. It's too disjointed, and not particulary frightening or gory.",1433462400,6,2029,4.456989247311828

8185719,2,B0000W3QS6,I didn't even finish this movie because it was so slow and boring. I watched about an hour of it. The acting was absolutely horrible. Delivery of lines and dialogue between characters was painful to watch. I don't know how this movie has a 95% on rotten tomatoes. It's always the bad movies that get a high percentage. Also some of the jokes and lines you won't understand until you finally realize this is supposed to be in the 1960s or 70s. Some of the ghost/demons scenes are good but they don't make up for the rest of the boring movie. I wouldn't recommend. It's a good thing this movie was free.,1523923200,,601,4.375

8185721,3,B0000W3QS6,"We Are Still Here is a high-quality movie, especially considering the genre. But its not a typical horror movie, so if you're looking for something that hooks your inner sense of dread and drags it out through your quivering bloodied navel, this might disappoint you.  Only the mildest psychological horror, which evokes more sorrow than fear. Compared to typical horror you might find this movie tame, even slow.

Plot: 3 stars. A lot of the illogical behavior can be explained by the inherent chaos of revenge, but there is one car scene that does not make any sense as the rest of the story unfolds**. The plot is not the most original, but it does give a unique twist to the generic Haunted House story.

Gore: 5 stars. As someone who watches a lot of horror, I could not help but notice how artfully the gore was  executed. lol. And yes, towards the end it does get bloody*

Pacing: 2 stars. If anything, this movie is a bit too subtle. At no point does it feel tense or frighteningthough you do feel sorry when some of the innocent bystanders get killed.

Dialogue cliched at times 3 stars. Cast probably deserves 4+ stars as a whole. Liked Crampton especially

*Spoilers: I am in love with the way the stairway starts chewing people up and then the image cuts to the important dark spot of evil in the basement, which exhales a mist of blood! Breathe the carnage! Eeee!
**Spoilers: the possession and the murder of the visiting family didn't really make sense to me, but the vindictiveness the spirits showed to the sons girlfriend was kind of absurd... leaving the house to follow her down the highway, for what? the perceived insult of kissing her boyfriend in their house?  but the people they wanted to murder were right there in town?

Worth a watch if you like classic slasher type movies.  Acting from everyone except the two leads was very meh, thus the 4 stars.",1517011200,,412,4.368421052631579
8185724,3,B0000W3QS6,"A modestly fun throwback horror film, though the bulk of its run time feels to be merely in service of its climax. The last 15-20 minutes of this film are pretty great, blood-soaked entertainment that recall the practical effects horror era. The film as a whole though ends up feeling slight and skeletal. I'm generally a fan of slow burn horror that builds to an explosive climax, but the simplicity of the story and overall flatness of the characters gave the build an inert quality that didn't generate as much intrigue as it could have. There was also an over reliance on jump scares for the first two acts, which is never a preference of mine and felt a bit at odds with the throwback quality of the film. Still, there's fun to be had here and the climax of the film mostly justifies the rest of it... mostly.
