8130277,5,B000GB75CE,"HIV/Aids-Accuirred Immunodeffecincey Syndrome also known as AIDS hit the spotlight unfortunately in June 1981 and has affected us ever since.

8130279,5,B000GB75CE,"I have been involved in AIDS work in the US since the mid- 80's and I have seen many documentaries that attempt to do what this film does.  It is quite simply the best documentary that I have ever seen, toally comprehensive and easy to follow.  I have used it with adult students and would use it again and again.",1206403200,10,313,4.2
8130280,5,B000GB75CE,"If you're looking for a comprehensive history of the AIDS epidemic covering the last 25 years, this would be an excellent place to start.  This 2 part documentary covers 4 hours of material presented in a meticulous and sincere manner.

The first half of this program begins with a detailed timeline beginning in 1981 exploring the first AIDS cases diagnosed in America.  What started as a purported homosexual disease quickly became a heterosexual disease and then splintered into intravenous drug user groups and eventually ended up threatening the national blood supply system.  In this same year, a few European countries diagnosed new AIDS cases of their own and this was the early warning signs of the soon to be massive AIDS epidemic.

Medical research is explored next and it spotlights not only the discovery of the HIV virus in 1983 but looks at the many difficulties experienced by scientists as they try to combat and eradicate this deadly organism.  The drug AZT, designed to assist in controlling the disease is touched on briefly but its overall impact later on was not as significant as once hoped.

Social, economical, and the often turbulent political elements of the AIDS crisis are examined in-depth for the latter half of this first installment.  This was a very good idea considering all these factors have such a pivotal and influential impact on a global scale.

The second part of this documentary starts with an examination of AIDS spreading throughout the African continent at an alarming rate and then looks at how AIDS cases have pervaded Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, India, and China.  The implications of this disease spreading throughout some of the world's most populous countries are scary enough in itself.

A watershed event occurred many years into this epidemic and it was the medical discovery of an aggressive drug treatment used to combat AIDS, but it wasn't a cure.  Unfortunately, it came with an astronomical price tag to treat each individual patient and the dilemma this caused for underdeveloped and poor countries is discussed in this segment.

Finishing off this documentary is an examination of activist's efforts, prevention programs, and sex education as these all play vital supporting roles in the continuing efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic.

If I ever see another presentation on the topic of AIDS, I am going to measure it against this wonderful PBS documentary.  The scope and detail of this material is far ranging, very informative, and exceedingly well presented.  I highly recommend this program to everyone.",1185494400,19,2576,5.11217183770883
8130281,5,B000GB75CE,"FRONTLINE: THE AGE OF AIDS was a wonderful, absorbing, comprehensive documentary worldwide history of the spread of HIV/AIDS. It was made by Frontline for PBS (originally broadcast in June 2006).

I particularly recommend this for anyone born since the mid 70s. The generation age 30 and younger is living without a sense of history (that might contribute to saving their lives).

I was particularly inspired by an interview segment with Bono, who recounted a conversation he had with Senator Jesse Helms (who had been staunchly against federal funding for HIV/AIDS causes until this meeting with Bono).

I HIGHLY recommend it.",1185235200,9,627,5.25
8130282,5,B000GB75CE,"I saw this on TV and I thought I'd learned all the stuff these documentaries usually have to say, but I only saw just the second half of it or so and it was fascinating, and I learned a lot of new things, even though I've already seen a few documentaries on AIDS at school, and I have read a lot about it.

This documentary was really interesting and really effective.  It had lots of new information, and a really deep impact, and at the end of it, it ended just so powerfully that my sister and I just looked at each other, and both of us had tears in our eyes.

I really think everyone should see this documentary.  It ties in science, socioeconomic stuff from around the world, talks about the US, and just... is really amazing.",1150675200,15,732,4.244604316546763
