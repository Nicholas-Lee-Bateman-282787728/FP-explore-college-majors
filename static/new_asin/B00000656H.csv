8261473,5,B00000656H,"When segments of AEROBICISE first aired on The Tomorrow Show. The Tonight Show, Showtime and ON-TV, they created a national sensation. Letters poured in begging for more. So now, for the first time, our complete AEROBICISE course in three videocassettes is available for you. This program, THE BEGINNING WORKOUT, is designed as an introduction to AEROBICISE. Featuring seven beautiful girls and two agile guys, The BEGINNING WORKOUT runs 96 minutes and is divided into four self-contained 24-minute classes progressing in difficulty. Produced and directed by famed fashion photographer Ron Harris, AEROBICISE is unprecedented. It's an exercise course-winner of Video Review's 1982 VIRA Award for ""Best How To Program"" It's a show featuring original music. It's graphically outrageous, innovative and entrancing. In short, AEROBICISE is a sensual spectacle. Something you can simply sit and watch. Play at parties. Give as a gift. Best of all, because the show looks just too good to resist, you're going to be inspired to join in and start moving. Whether you're a watcher or a joiner, you're going to enjoy AEROBICISE--the fun way to improve the quality of your life.",1169078400,3,1168,5.318918918918919
