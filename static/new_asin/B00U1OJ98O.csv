8703860,2,B00U1OJ98O,"Frank White dates the bosses' daughter his childhood sweetheart. They live in Amarillo. He and his brother T-White sell cars for her father. They decide they are talented enough to to be in the rap industry (Frank can't sing so he raps, T-can actually carry a tune). In Houston they flip a home, Frank's gf is pregnant, which doesn't seem to be his, and they do a video which takes up 5 minutes of the film.  T claims to have 5 children  and 4 baby mommas and appears he is looking to add to the collection. I found the film fairly lame.

No sex or nudity. I don't even recall any F-bombs or N-words.",1436572800,,600,4.245614035087719
