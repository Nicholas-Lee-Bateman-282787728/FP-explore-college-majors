7843942,5,6303237193,"The 1984 TV movie Scrooge's Rock `N' Roll Christmas starring veteran character actor Jack Elam as Scrooge and Lee Benton as The Girl, did come out in VHS format which is what you see being offered here.

The soundtrack, which initially came out as the Hitbound LP HB-1003, WAS converted to CD at some point but unfortunately only remained available briefly and now can only be found in used form (or perhaps an unopened copy in a few cases), making one wonder if the rights aren't tied up in some kind of litigation preventing new releases. The contents of both, wioth the artists concerned also appearing in the film as Magic Snow Globe Singers and ""partiers"" are: 1. Carol Of The Bells - The Ensemble; 2. Rocking Around The Christmas Tree - Three Dog Night; 3. White Christmas - Merilee Rush; 4. Jingle Bells - Paul Revere & The Raiders; 5. Do You Hear What I Hear? - Mike Love (of The Beachboys) & Mary MacGregor; 6. Jingle Bell Rock - Mike Love & Dean Torrence (of Jan & Dean); 7. Sleigh Ride - The Association; 8. Winter Wonderland - Bobby Goldsboro; 9. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - Mike Love; 10. We Wish You A Merry Christmas - The Ensemble.

To my knowledge the movie has never been reformatted for DVD, which is somewhat puzzling given some of the other absolute seasonal junk that has been dumped on the DVD market. A quality package containing both a DVD and CD soundtrack would, I'm sure, be eagerly snapped up by Christmas movie and music lovers everywhere.",1419724800,2,1482,4.546816479400749

Well, after years of watching with my family, they all complained about the Sony Beta Hi Fi Machine (which actually had hi fi sound and great resolution superior to VHS). So, eventually I bought a VHS HI FI just to shut them up.  The VHS version, which I still own is fine, works well, and has the usual VHS quality. I had a transfer made from the VHS format to a DVD by a friend that replicates tapes to DVD format.  it was okay, but I sure would like to find a factory produced DVD of this awesome Holiday.  Heres a brief rundown of Jack Elam, who portrays Scrooge in this A Christmas Carol setting in Scrooges place of business.

Elam, who has since passed, was a fine character actor that goes back to early TV Westerns and eventually worked into minor movie roles as time went b, in the 60's.  I late 1969 or 70, he was in a great Western Spoof called ""Support Your Local Sheriff, with James Garner, Bruce Dern, Harry Morgan and Elam.  Elam played Jake, the town drunk, who Garner took under his wing after being hired as the Sheriff in a Gold Ruch town.  Garner took Elam off the street and made him his Deputy.

i remember seeing Elam in just about TV Western ever made, and he usually played an outlaw, but as time went on, he got a few roles away from that typecast. Support your Local Sheriff was a great movie and Elam stole the show from Garner, who was also familiar to Western TV fans from his success as Maverick.

Anyway, I am looking for a Clean, Professionally made DVD version of Scrooge's Rock and Roll Christmas.  Three Dog Night, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Bobby Goldsboro, The Associatiion, a few unknowns, and Mike Love of Beach Boy fame, are all in it doing really nice versions of several Christmas songs, especially Three Dog Night's Rocking Around the Christmas to start things off.

Anyway, i hope someone can help me with this one.

Happy Holidays !

7843944,5,6303237193,"I found this holiday video chock-full of lackluster lip-synching and embarrassed readings of script lines - something about this production just screams JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER LINE OF COKE AND TELL MY AGENT HE'S FIRED.

  The Christmas special stars Jack Elam, former character actor as Scrooge, but there is where the resemblance to a Dickens story ends. Ebenezer becomes mellow within minutes of hearing a slew of bad performances by musical has-beens emanating from a snow globe. Paul Revere and the Raiders sing Jingle Bells while wearing silver platform space boots stolen from Parliament's Clones of Dr. Funkenstein; Chuck Negron of 3 Dog Night appears to be in a clueless drug haze as his mulleted bandmates smile and sing in the snow. Some new talent called 'Bridget', probably a relative of the producer, stands inside a rotted tree singing a song about the baby Jesus.

  I'm confused - this is 1983 and all these dudes are so ten years ago then. Scrooge gets cranked up with another hot sixties act - not Cream! not the Stones! Nope, another quintessential hip act from the summer of love - The Association! As in Along Comes Mary! Cherish! I am soon feeling the holiday joy as the boys lip synch to Home for the Holidays while macking on a cast of Boogie Nights disco lookalikes.

  And then- Bobby Goldsboro! Wearing the same hair helmet he sported when he was singing about his dead lover Honey and Watching Scotty Grow! He scowls and looks at his feet as if he was unwillingly teleported like Captain Kirk into this Christmas atrocity. He won't even walk in time to the music. Darn, he looks angry...Bobby's more Scrooge than Jack Elam!

  'I think I like them rock and rolls'... Scrooge/Elam exclaims after the Goldsboro performance.

  Then the rocking out continues with Mary MacGregor and Beach Boy Mike Love singing Do You Hear What I Hear. He looks skeazy and women look away as if he is reeking of too much eggnog.

  So, if you desire heartwarming Christmas carols performed by pop stars on the skids with the production values of couple-next-door porn... don't miss Scrooge's Rock and Roll Christmas!",1127952000,4,2122,4.814917127071824
