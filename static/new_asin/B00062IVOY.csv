2159505,4,B00062IVOY,"I am not a golfer, but seeing this movie made me want to play. I was impressed by the beauty of the golf courses.  Bobby impressed me very much.  I liked his sense of honesty.  He is a good roll model for young men.  This movie is a classic to me.  When you want to come away from a movie feeling good, go see this one. The way the story was told was very good.  From a small boy, and then growing up. I thought Jim Caviezel looked very much like Bobby.  I was not bored at all.",1085011200,25,478,3.816326530612245
2159506,5,B00062IVOY,"As powerful as the movie and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Christ in The Passion of the Christ is, the movie IS NOT ENTERTAINING.  Big Surprise!  This movie is entertaining to watch because of Caviezel's subtle portrayal of Bobby Jones, the good supporting cast, the wonderful scenery, and the positive message of the movie.  I'm definitely going to purchase the DVD, and I don't even like golf!",1084233600,12,393,4.924242424242424
2159507,4,B00062IVOY,"For as long as I can remember my goal in life was to be the starting third baseman for the Chicago White Sox.  Which was an ambitious goal considering I never even started on my Little League teams.  I always thought that if I was gifted in baseball that I would be willing to play without pay.  I loved the game that much.
Bobby Jones loved golf like I love baseball and he had the ability that matched his desire.  He also had a life outside of Golf and was never content to be defined by what he accomplished as a player.
Jim Caviezel is amazingly convincing as Bobby Jones.  Caviezel has a remarkable ability to become the character he is portraying.  His dead-on performance brings added poignancy to the narrative.
The story is also aided by the strong performances of Claire Forlani as Jone's wife and Jeremy Northam as his main rival, Walter Hagen.  In lesser hands these supporting roles could have been caricatures that did little to add to the pathos or the plot.
Through these performance and through the extraordinary golf sequences the viewer comes away with an acute understanding of the love affair that people have with the games they play.",1083715200,13,1157,4.614634146341463
2159508,2,B00062IVOY,"Being an Atlanta native, I grew up with the legend of Bobby Jones.  It's a shame that the movie did not match his standards for quality in his golf and his life. It is slow and plodding, the acting stiff and the scenes awkwardly staged not very natural.  Instead of feeling you were in 1920, you constantly sensed that it was shot today trying to imitate 1920.  James Caviezel was actually pretty good, but the movie as a whole just had an amateurish production quality. Bobby Jones was a great person, more so than a great golfer.  The movie tried to show this, I just wish it could have been done more professionally.",1083456000,2,619,4.451327433628318
2159509,4,B00062IVOY,"I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at its premiere in NYC and learning more about the making of the film.  The film itself is well done and gives you a real sense of the character of Bob Jones.  He is a man that overcame his own problems through discipline, strength of character, and determination.  No excuses, just do it. Lessons most of us need to practice!
But the story behind the story is just as inspiring.  The independent film made by the Bobby Jones Film Foundation was made on a shoestring budget yet has continued to give and raise money for charities.  The foundation believes in the philanthropic legacy of the Jones family - there's more to life that money and winning championships. Bobby Jones was diagnosed and suffered from syringomyelia - a painful and degenerative spinal disorder that some 240,000 Americans suffer from.
The American Syringomyelia Alliance Project (ASAP) is a non-profit charity supporting research and education for people affected by syringomyelia.  The Jones family and the Bobby Jones Film Foundation are generously supporting ASAP as well as other charities.  Bobby Jones chose to make the best of his life despite syringomyelia - through his continuing legacy, ASAP is improving the lives of those with syringomyelia today.  Go see this film and be prepared to be inspired.

2159510,4,B00062IVOY,"Bobby Jones was a golf legend in his time.  He made a name for himself in the 1920s and 1930s by winning some of the most coveted tournaments in golf.  This is his story, lovingly told.
We first meet Bobby as a small boy in Georgia.  He been sickly as a baby and his mother wants to overprotect him.  But he tags along when his father is trying to perfect his own skill at the game, and eventually Bobby wins some tournaments as a teenager.  We all want him to win, despite the fact that he has a tendency to overreact when he misses a shot and throws his golf clubs around.
As he grows into manhood the role of Bobby, the adult, is taken over by Jim Caviezel.  He's actually 36 years old and looked a little old for the part, which followed Bobby's career up to the age of 28, when he quit golf forever, suffering from a debilitating neurological disease.  Bobby's a good guy, marrying his young sweetheart and becoming a father of two small children.  Problem is that, in spite of Bobby getting a college education, he still loved his golf and kept traveling around the world to play.  This disturbed his wife, who understood the strain Bobby was always under when he played.  We all get to feel Bobby's stress as we watch his semi-breakdowns, which wound up to be medical in nature.
Some of the film was shot at St. Andrew's golf course in Scotland, and really captured the challenges of that particular course.  The period of history was beautifully rendered as well, with all the details in place to transport the viewer into the time period evoked.  It was a pleasure to step into that world for the course of the film.
I guess this could be called an inspiring story of this man who overcame adversity and won so many accolades.  He certainly is a legend in the golf world.  I was glad to learn something about him, even though I felt the story dragged too much and never really captured my heart.",1083110400,19,1904,4.387464387464387

2159583,3,B00062IVOY,"not a bad film, just some historical inaccuracy concerning his scores/margins of victory.

In my opinion, no one, excepting Bernhard Langer, will ever give in equal measure to the game what these men have given.  The Bobby Jones legacy is well told, especially the story of his love for his wife and family... a much needed inspiration in the world of sports these days.",1482105600,,426,4.605263157894737

2159752,5,B00062IVOY,"This movie seems a bit magical rather than serious realism. I think that's why I loved it. I appreciate stories of people who triumph in life despite physical pain and high pressure from relationships. Jim Caviziel captured the essence of who Bobby Jones was, from what I've read. The character highlights of these people were emphasized rather than just a gritty reality of dog-eat-dog in the world of golf touraments (and all other pro/amateur sports for that matter). The friendship shown in the movie were real.

The music helped win me over too. Jones' ties to Scotland and The Open weren't something made up for the movie. To move someone to engage emotionally in a movie, great music aids this process. Should have won an Oscar for the music and the cinematography.

It's different than The Greatest Game Every Played, which is also a great movie for different reasons. Even if you don't like golf, you'd like the movie because it's about the man and his dream.",1420156800,,968,4.790419161676646

My 8-year-old, who is a pretty good lefty himself, loves to watch ""The Greatest Game"" over and over again. But he quickly lost interest in ""Stroke of Genius"" after the first few scenes. And although he patiently sat through it until the end, he told me afterwards that he did not want to watch it again. And neither do I. The movie feels disjointed, and the language is definitely not G-rated.

Though the story is predictable and by-the-numbers, it doesn't take away from the extraordinary story of Bobby Jones and his legacy. Caviezel is great as Jones and really nails the swing mechanics that made the golfer so famous. I also enjoyed Malcolm McDowell's performance as O.B. Keeler, the local sportscaster who followed Jones throughout his entire career. Overall this is a very informative and inspiring story about one of the greatest golfers, and all-around gentleman, to ever play the game.",1364256000,2,595,5.144329896907217
2160027,5,B00062IVOY,"This is a really good story about the golfer Bobby Jones! The struggle that Bobby has with his personal demons and his triumph over them and golf in the end is just heart warming and there's a sweet little love story to wrap it up all nice and perty. Jim Caviezel is great as Bobby. But my biggest shock, delightful surprise really about the movie was when I first heard the familiar Irish accent of Pastor Alistair Begg then saw him play Bobby's golf coach, Madison. I've listened to Pastor Alistair Begg's sermons in the past and knew he was pretty conservative so to see him act in a Hollywood film was pleasantly surprising. Overall, great movie, you won't be disappointed if you purchase.",1363737600,,693,4.596774193548387

But aside from that, I think he hit on the true person of who Bobby Jones really was - a genuine, good person who gave his best to himself, the game, and his fans.  Despite his degenerative health, he gave his life to his family, both immediate and married families.  He pursued what he loved with every ounce of passion and decidedly chose the path of being an amateur instead of a professional.  I loved the resilience he portrayed despite any misgivings he may have had during the course of his life.  I wish I were more like that.

In the movie, Bobby Jones swears when he hits a bad shot, (well, others say a few too but they don't ramble on with it) otherwise it might have a G rating instead of PG. It is a great movie that shows not only his golf skills, but also includes a love story, his personal integrity, and health challenges in his life.

2160123,5,B00062IVOY,"I have read many books on Bobby Jones, some written by Bobby himself. He has always been a hero of mine because of the many obstacles he faced such as his health, traveling long distances by trains and boats, and trying to play and win for his home town of Atlanta, GA. He was a part time golfer who never played in the winter and then picked up his clubs two or three weeks before the US open and go out and win it! As an example, he won a major invitational tournament in my home town of Knoxville, TN in 1916 at the age of 14. Having read so many true stories of Bobby Jones, I feel I can judge this movie as to its veracity and everything in this movie, to the best of my knowledge,is true! The acting, color, clothes and scenery are all excellent. Watch this movie and you will agree that Robert Tyre Jones Jr. was the greatest golfer of them all!",1329264000,,852,4.107784431137724

I have since checked several (well-informed) ""history of golf"" books, and found that the movie seems to be very accurate. If there WERE any liberties taken, they were not significant nor did they alter the career or personal life of the man.
While he was a prodigy who became a legend of the game, he was also just a man, who had more important things to do with his life than continue to keep knocking a small ball toward a hole.
This movie helped me gain a greater understanding of who Bobby Jones really was, and brought admiration and respect for not only the golfer, but the man.",1247184000,,697,4.369230769230769

2160150,5,B00062IVOY,"I saw this film during its first showing on the Golf channel.  The Director and screenwriter, Rowdy Herrington is a friend.  No doubt I'm prejudiced, but I hadn't seen this film.

You may be familiar with some of Rowdy's other work:  Roadhouse, A Murder of Crows, The Stickup, or I, Witness.  None of those would prepare you for this.  I know those films and like them.  They're generally contemporary movies with a good edge of suspense.

This is a period film with gorgeous costumes and brilliant cinematography.  The story's first rate and told by master story tellers.

I was frankly amazed I hadn't heard of the film, which is probably why it wasn't a major hit.  If you liked Chariots of Fire, Rocky, or Hoosiers, you'll love this movie, and now that I've seen it, I'm going to buy it.",1240617600,,791,4.578571428571428

2160153,5,B00062IVOY,"Wow, what a nice movie! Beautifully filmed, too.  I've watched this three times now and love it each time.

This is a loving tribute to the American amateur golf legend Bobby Jones but it doesn't sugarcoat his story. Jones is shown with his good and bad sides, especially his horrible temper which he corrected, and his nervous ailments which he was unable to correct and caused an early retirement from the game.

There is a lot of golf footage in here, of tournaments won and lost and battles against famous professional Walter Hagen, who always is pictured in these golf films as an arrogant, flamboyant man. In contrast, Jones' modest character is even more apparent than would normally be noticed.

Anyway, Jim Caveziel is likable as Jones and the two young actors who play the famous golfer as a kid also do very well. Jones' love interest is appealingly played by Claire Forlani. The two make for a handsome couple.

This is simply a good-natured, feel-good movie that is pleasing to the eyes as well as the heart. If you are a golfer, this a must, but a nice story even if you don't play the game.

If you already own the DVD, check out the documentaries here. They are quite interesting, too.",1233100800,,1201,4.615023474178404

2160214,2,B00062IVOY,"Sports and movies - should be a PERFECT combination.  Especially a story of a true sportsman, a true gentleman of the game, someone who loved to play the game for the game itself.

But this movie doesn't spend enough time telling us about the real Bobby Jones.  It leaves us hanging and wondering. There is one point where he is playing with a woman golfer and she is refered to as his girlfriend - WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?  At another point, he is in the hospital, temporarily banned from the game.  Then flip to him writing a letter of apology, then flip to him playing golf.  Well what happened to the hospital stay?

2160215,4,B00062IVOY,"To fully appreciate THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED, it's good to compare it with BOBBY JONES, STROKE OF GENIUS. Both films cost between $20M and $25M. Both were about the game of golf at the turn of the 20th century. Both focused on young, underprivileged underdogs who went on to become the best amateurs in the game, beating out their professional competition. And both show the influence of the great Harry Vardon.

BOBBY JONES, STROKE OF GENIUS is, of course, about Bobby Jones, only amateur ever to win all three tournaments of the Grand Slam in the same year. And he did it while also working on three college degrees simultaneously - thus the ""Genius."" Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) did a decent job playing Bobby, although he didn't look anything like the man. And Aiden Quinn was good as Harry Vardon - even down to his golfing ability - although he was all but cut from the film because he wouldn't shave a goatee he had grown for another film.

While BOBBY JONES is about an entire golf career, THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is about one tournament: the 1913 US Open, held at Brookline Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. That was the year that a caddie - Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the country club - beat the two top British professionals, including Harry Vardon, and won the tournament - the biggest upset in golf history. Shia LeBeouf (Holes) does a great job playing Ouimet, and Stephen Dillane (The Hours) is superb as Vardon.

The biggest difference between these two films is in the direction. With BOBBY JONES, Rowdy Herrington (Road House) opted to do a very straight drama in the tradition of Chariots of Fire. It turned out to be far more than he could handle. The script is weak. There is far too much time spent on the young Bobby Jones, which contributes very little to the main plot. And visually, it is, well, boring. There are only a handful of creatively interesting shots.

But in THE GREATEST GAME, director Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, acting) pulls out all the stops. Not only is the script taut, but every part of it is essential. And the visuals are incredible, including effects that have never been seen in a sports film before, let alone one about golf. The art direction - including sets, costumes and graphics - is also superb, creating a totally believable and visually sumptuous world. You don't have to love golf to love this movie. That can't be said about BOBBY JONES. While both films have heart, THE GREATEST GAME also has fun.

When I first saw THE GREATEST GAME, there were a couple of things that bothered me. I didn't feel the love relationship between Francis and Sarah Wallis (Peyton List) was believable because their ages seemed so different. I just couldn't see her falling for a boy. I also had trouble accepting a ten-year-old caddy, Eddie Lowery, played like a true ham by Josh Flitter. It seemed like a typical Disney element (the kid who is smarter than the adults that surround him), and I just didn't buy into it. Then I discovered that that really was the way it was! Which doesn't make it any easier to believe, but at least it's true.

These are two very different films about similar events. While BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS is a good film (3 to 4 stars), THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is a great film (5 stars). Both directors had a vision; but Bill Paxton has proven that he can carry his out.

Part of it was also the script that lacked engaging dialouge.  With the exception of Jeremy Northam as Walter Hagan (the one bright spot in the movie), the characters were two-dimentional and forgetable.

Jones fought a debilitating spinal disease to become the greatest amateur golfer of our time.  He is the only golfer in history to win the grand slam.  Director Rowdy Herrington shows a respect for the game and he does his best to canonize Jones.  Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ, Frequency) embodies the role well, although at times he seems so unhappy it's hard to feel joy with him when it does occur.  Claire Forlani lends good support as his supportive wife; Malcolm McDowell plays the rare good guy as Jones's sportswriting friend; and Jeremy Northam brings a good amount of egoism to his role as rival Walter Hagen.

2160280,4,B00062IVOY,"Not being a golfer or a fan of biographies of sportsmen, this viewer found a surprising amount of satisfaction in this recreation of the life of Bobby Jones, whose fame in the game of golf is legendary.  So the question arises: ""How can a film about golf maintain such a viewer's attention and appreciation?""

The answer lies in the physical production of this beautiful little film.  Capturing the essence of the world in the 1920s and 1930s not only in costuming and manners and atmosphere but in sociologic and philosophic vantages, Director Rowdy Herrington has ably explored the life and times of the reluctant hero in a way that exhumes a period in history when everyone needed something to believe in.  Actors Jim Caviezel, Malcolm McDowell, Jeremy Northam, and Claire Forlani not only look their parts: their demeanor before the camera absorbs the state of mind of America lapsing from the riotous 20s to the massive depression of the 30s.

Bobby Jones physical problems, both self induced and genetic, are explored with just enough veracity to make him more of a well-rounded character than a cardboard saint (we don't learn the name of his neurological disorder - syringomyelia - until the final credits).  His struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds to move through every golfing challenge of his day and succeed beyond the realm of possibility is well captured in Caviezel's delicately nuanced performance.

Not a great movie, but certainly worth more attention than it received in the theaters.  You don't need to be a golfer to appreciate the beauty of this little moment of nostalgia.  Grady Harp, June 05",1117756800,7,1627,5.018587360594796
2160281,1,B00062IVOY,"To begin, the facts within the movie are inaccurate.  The film attempts to portray a series of opposing forces pulling at Bobby  from different directions; i.e his mother disapproving of his golfing as it detracts from his schooling, and his father encouraging his golfing at the expense of his studies.  This if false, as his mother was really an avid golfer, and the family used to go golfing together quite avidly.

The list goes on with false portrayals of of his tournament play, the nature of his relationship with Walter Hagen, his home life, the nature of his study habits, and even the portrayal of the personality and character of Bobby Jones himself is inaccurate within the film.

As if the above list is not enough to ruin the film, the production of the film was the final straw.

The story line was scattered and choppy.  It didn't flow and if you did not have some prior knowledge of the life of Bobby Jones, you would probably not be able to understand the significance of many of the scenes.

The dialogue was cheesy, the story line was poorly edited, and the facts of Jones' life were both distorted and often outright wrong.

The only positive lights in this film were the scenes of St. Andrews.  But its pretty hard to botch up footage of the greatest golf course in history.",1115424000,8,1296,4.595652173913043
2160282,4,B00062IVOY,"The name of Bobby Jones has an aura of greatness and gentility about it that still shines more than seventy years since he retired from competitive golf and more than thirty years since his death.  In our age of money sports, it is difficult to conceive of how anyone could accomplish all Bobby Jones accomplished as an amateur.  If you count all his victories at professional tournaments (for which he received not a dime) and his amateur championship victories (which had a much higher status than they do today), he is still second to only Jack Nicklaus and still ahead of such luminaries as Tiger Woods, Walter Hagen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and, well, everyone else.  If you only count professional championships, Bobby Jones is still tied for eighth.

Oh, and he is the still the only man to ever win the golfing Grand Slam in a single season. The closest anyone has come is the amazing four straight majors by Tiger Woods a few years back.  (Look, when Tiger was the defending champion at all four major championships, you have to acknowledge something near miraculous had been accomplished.)

Never mind that along the way he received undergraduate degrees in Engineering from Georgia Tech and in English from Harvard.  He also studied law for a year at Emory University and was admitted to the Georgia Bar in 1928 (all before he accomplished the Grand Slam in 1930).  He was also married in 1924.  He and his wife, Mary, raised three children.  Oh, and he founded and built Augusta National and founded the Masters Tournament.

So, no matter what you admire, pure sports accomplishment, sports history, nostalgia for lost nobility, the idea of a balanced life, or just about anything else you want to project onto his life, Bobby Jones lived a life worth knowing something about.  This film, ""Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius"" is a good bio-pic that tells us about how Bobby Jones became the golfing prodigy he was and the toll winning all those tournaments took on him.

I had always had the vague notion that Bobby Jones simply retired because, like some Classic Hero, he had no more worlds to conquer.  It may have been partly that, but it was also that the pressure he put on himself to win taxed him to his limits and he valued his family life enough to walk away rather than lose what mattered most in life.

This film does not look to demean Bobby Jones in any way or discuss those aspects of that time in the South that would be repugnant to us today sitting smugly in our culture of Political Correctness.  Rather, this is about his golfing life and career and his relationship with his father, grandfather, mother, wife, Walter Hagen, and O.B. Keeler (the writer for the Atlanta Journal who followed Jones's career - here wonderfully played by Malcolm McDowell).

James Caviezel does a good job showing us the nobility that rose through the torment of Jones's life and Jeremy Northam does a fine job as the dissolute Walter Hagen acting as the foil for Jones.  Is the film more hagiography that biography?  Probably, yes.  Could it have been darker and more demeaning of Jones?  Also, probably, yes.  But why?  Jones earned his legendary reputation and that is part of his life as well.  We should treasure such greatness rather than cheat ourselves of it by dragging it through imported mud.

A good film for everyone not just golfers.  Oh, beware, there is a bit of profanity - I guess Jones swore when he was younger and became frustrated.  The swearing, such as it is, is more endearing than shocking - at least in the way it is presented to us in the film.",1106092800,6,3579,4.657643312101911

It certainly was interesting to learn about Jones, even when the pace of the movie was a tad slow at times.

There are some important lessons that are stressed in this movie about overcoming adversity, money ruining sports, and ""there are more important things than winning championships.""  Another thing is the costumes are cool of course and remind me of my favorite golfer, the late Payne Stewart.

This is not an awesome, life changing film, but it is still a lot better than most of the films that come out of Hollywood.  There is no doubt that the film's treatment of Jones was a tad saintly, and some moments are slow and detatched, but in the end it was pretty cool and inspiring.",1104710400,5,947,4.4393063583815024

Build Augusta National!

This well acted life of Bobby Jones is so well done by the actors.  Give them all credit, they masterfully created essence of this great sportsman's life.

Only golf fans would be interested in this movie in the first place, and since we already knew his achievements, there was never a climax hoping to see if he would make the 80 foot snaking putt in Scotland Yard. There were surprises, his early frustrations, the fact that he never turned pro, and his physical maladies. But, not enough interest to spend 2 hours watching it take place.

2160341,2,B00062IVOY,"After watching this film I feel that we need to have a serious talk about Jim Caviezel's ego. Just in case he wasn't feeling quite perfect enough after playing Jesus, he signs up for another film in which he is portrayed as being far above human.  In fact, director Rowdy Herrington made great strides to try to make the audience forget that Bobby Jones was actually human. We see Jones turning down women and money and gambling. We see Jones overcome injury. And we see it all while the score in the background has us expecting Jones to suddenly rise up and levitate into the heavens.  All the things that he did in the film he very well may have done in real life. However, when a film casually glosses over any faults he may have it destroys the credibility of the picture as a whole. This film also had the feel of a made for TV movie.  It was cheesy and simplistic, and in the end I just wanted this melodrama to be over.  The film tries to teach us that pride is more important that money.  To do so they paint this horrible picture of rich, white society where nothing matters so long as you are rich and religious.  But aren't those the people that idolize Bobby Jones, and who would be willing to watch this film? I've always thought it best not to insult your main customer. Above all this I also felt as though the film had no creativity. Yes, we know all athletes have family members who don't approve.  We also know that anytime we see a kid in a man's world he is accompanied by ice cream (see ""Little Big League"").

This movie was exemplary from the get-go---the acting, the story, the golf scenes---beatiful!  It is the story of Bobby Jones' personal journey to greatness.  It is not just for golfers, but for anyone interested in being entertained, inspired, and uplifted, all at the same time.

Of course, Bobby Jones' story is true as well.  The movie illustrates his struggles balancing family concerns with golf, struggling with physical pain and chronic illness, and the pressures faced by a great athlete.  Bobby Jones was an individual with courage and integrity.  Special features include an actual clip of a speech made by Bobby Jones.  Movies this good are not made often enough!

*****",1102550400,22,689,5.135135135135135
2160343,3,B00062IVOY,"Bobby Jones was to golf as Babe Ruth was to baseball, but unlike the Bambino his greatest legacy still stands secure three-quarter of a century later.  In 1930 he won what would come to be known as the Grand Slam, winning all four of the major golf tournaments in the same year.  The feat has never been duplicated, although Tiger Woods did accomplish what is being called the ""Tiger Slam,"" which is to hold all four titles at the same time although not in the same year.  But Jones accomplished this feat as an amateur, and as is amply evidenced in this film, an ""amateur"" in the truest sense of the word, not to mention one that has all but been forgotten in contemporary sports.

Since Jim Caviezel filmed ""Bobby Jones, Stroke of Genius"" right after he finished ""The Passion of the Christ,"" it has invited a lot of Jesus Jones/Bobby Christ jokes.  Given how the actor presented a very human Jesus in the flashback's in Mel Gibson's movie, it would be rather ironic if his performance as Jones constitutes more of a saintly figure.  But what really drives the notion that Bobby Jones is a holy figure in this movie is not Caviezel's performance but the musical score by James Horner, which sanctifies the character before he ever appears in the film and does not let up throughout the rest of the movie. From the time that the young Bobby Jones (Devon Gearhart) first picks up a golf club, to the teenager (Thomas Lewis) who first starts winning golf tournaments, the music makes it clear that he is destined for a greatness that amounts to deification.  As such, this is one of the most counterproductive musical scores I have heard in quite some time (to wit, it is sub-par, but not in the good way, like on a golf course).

It is also ironic that this film comes out on DVD at a time when the two biggest stories in the world of sports are baseball players like Barry Bonds taking steroids and other things to enhance performance and the basketbrawl between the Indiana Pacers and the fans in Detroit.  We see that Jones was plagued by physical problems as well as having a terrible temper, but he rises above such concerns in ways that seem beyond the capabilities of modern sports icons (the film hints that he might be an alcoholic but at the end we learn that he would eventually be crippled by a degenerative spinal disease).  For that matter, the decision of Jones to walk away from competitive golf at the age of 28, having set a mark that has never been equaled, is eminently laudable, even more so when compared to the recent decision of football player Ricky Williams to retire in order to avoid being suspended for drug use.

There are several standard sport biopic subplots in ""Bobby Jones"" as well.  He has an over protective mother (Clara Jones), and while his father (Dan Albright) encourages his love of golf, Bobby's grandfather (Brett Rice) strongly disapproves.  Fortunately winning golf tournaments and becoming famous helps to solve such family problems.  More important become Bobby's relationships with the woman he marries, Mary Malone (Claire Forlani), the reporter who covers his life, O.B. Keeler (Malcolm McDowell), and the man who is his arch nemesis on the golf course, Walter Hagen (Jeremy Northam).  For the most part all of these people sit around and watch Jones work his miracles on the golf course, and the most memorable moments in the film tend to come when Hagen's face articulates what he cannot say, which is that he is neither the golfer that Bobby Jones nor the man.

In comparison to ""Seabiscuit,"" the most successful sports biopic of recent years, ""Bobby Jones, Stroke of Genius"" is just too earnest in its depiction of greatness.  The title of the film alone indicates they are engaging in overkill and the fact that the film was produced by a company called Bobby Jones Films LLC provides a big clue as to why his life is depicted with a reverence that is usually afforded only to Biblical figures.  The final irony is that I watched ""Bobby Jones, Stroke of Genius"" the same day that I watched ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,"" because while both are loaded with sports clichs, the latter embraces them lightheartedly while in the former they become a burdesome cross to bear.  However, they did get to film on the Old Course at St. Andrews and we do learn why there are 18 holes on a golf course, which are both good things (especially since they bring Robin William's routine on the origins of golf to mind).",1102464000,8,4464,4.656488549618321
2160344,5,B00062IVOY,"This film is a rare jewel...something to treasure always.  What a great and inspirational story!  Why aren't there more movies of this genre?  Obviously, part of the answer resides in the subject matter itself: Bobby Jones was an exceptional individual.  The film portrays him as he evidently really was and does not sugar-coat the character.  We enter the world of Jones and we get to know the man-- his strengths, his weaknesses, his humor, his moral fiber, his incorruptible nature.  This movie is NOT about golf--the game was a vehicule for Jones' personal journey.  As Kipling is quoted in the film: ""...if you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors as just the same..""  and, indeed, Jones did!  This movie has such a warm glow and the actors are nothing short of magnificent.  Jim Caviezel slips into the lead character and incarnates Jones--even his golf swing is reproduced with remarkable precision!  Caviezel shares so many qualities with Jones: charm, humor, vulnerability, intensity, and strength.

Malcolm MacDowell is loveable as Keeler and always the voice of reason as Bobby's mentor and friend; Brett Rice is equally believable as Bobby's father; and Aidan Quinn makes an understated but memorable cameo appearance as Vardon.  And who can forget Jeremy Northam as Jones' counterpart...Walter Hagen--  the amusing, egocentric, incorrigible, and all-too-human opponent!  Add to this the meticulous attention to detail in the wardrobes and other 1920s period items(like the automobiles!), the perfectly synchronized musical score by Horner, and the breathtaking landscapes and you've got yourself a work of unusual beauty and grace--like poetry, only even better!",1102118400,5,1698,5.354716981132076
2160345,5,B00062IVOY,"I am a member of Robert Tyre Jones's family. We had no financial investment whatsoever in this film. The producers and writers were kind enough to ask for our input about some of the family background for the picture. As for the borderline alchoholism........ where'd you get that? Because he drank along with everyone else in the movie that puts him in line for the Big Book? I think you may have jumped to a conclusion that is not supported.

Now, as for the movie, the strongest critics have probably been our family. We very much liked the movie, the cast was top notch, the music by James Horner was superb, the scenery and costumes were meticulously in period. Mr. Jones did not lead a flamboyant life, he was an extremely well educated southern gentleman, he was a family man. Naturally this will make for a sedate and well mannered yet entertaining film. It would have been inappropriate to add sex and car jackings in there for ratings. He was given the Freedom of the City of St. Andrews, Scotland in 1957, the only other American to have recieved this honor was Benjamin Franklin. I give this movie a 2 thumbs up.
