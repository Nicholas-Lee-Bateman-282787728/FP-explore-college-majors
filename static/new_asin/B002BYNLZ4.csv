8362555,5,B002BYNLZ4,Fun Conan cartoon!!,1431043200,,19,5.666666666666667
8362556,5,B002BYNLZ4,"This series was not on the air for long and few fantasy or Conan fans remember it. It features a watered down version of Conan in temperant but the essence of the character is retained. They filled in his origin,gave him friends who are excellent allies,Needle his baby Phoenix is so humorous when he refers Conan as a ""Big dumb barbarian."".The main villian Wrath-Amon is along the lines of James Earl Jones from the original Conan movie in 82. Conan fans should be able to relate to this series and may develop the same soft spot I did. I would recommend this anyone who enjoys He-Man,comic books or likes Conan stories. I had to wait for months to obtain this and it was well worth the money and time.",1396915200,,703,4.457364341085271

8362558,5,B002BYNLZ4,"One of my favorite cartoons with an actual goal to the series.  This is the story of Conan of Sumaria's journey of self-discovery as he fights to restore his family and defeat a dark threat to the entire world.  Helping Conan in his quest are the friends he acquires along the way; friends who strengthen his resolve and make him stronger.  Not to mention his little guide...a baby phoenix.  Excellently animated and thoughtfully executed from the first episode to the triumphant conclusion, this is a series worth the purchase price.",1341100800,2,534,4.9
8362559,5,B002BYNLZ4,"Even though this DVD set seems cheaply produced, it is still great to have it on DVD, since my VHS tapes were wearing thin. The quality is definitely not digital, but its as good as you can expect since the original tapes were probably never remastered. Overall, I consider this a good buy if you are a fan of this cartoon.",1265760000,5,323,4.311475409836065
