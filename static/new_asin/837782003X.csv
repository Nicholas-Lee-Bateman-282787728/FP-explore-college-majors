7901051,4,837782003X,"OK, not the greatest script in the world, but I am a big Dennis Hopper fan, so I have some pretty bad DH movies. This movie is the drugged-out merry prankster side of hippies.",1391817600,,175,4.176470588235294
7901052,5,837782003X,"Unfortunately among them is not likely to be a proper U.S. DVD issue of the original film, ""Riders Of The Storm"". This is the ""over-seas"" version, No changes to the movie itself, just the title and packaging. The main change I'm talking about is the price. A Canadian NTSC version has entered the picture and along with it the price just went ""collector's grade"". I paid just 7.98 for mine but I was expecting a PAL-ONLY Australian version possibly even C-grade VHS to Disk bootleg. I was prepared for that, that's how bad I wanted it. I'd planned to try and convert it on my computer if I had to. GOOD NEWS IS, the one I got IS NTSC, Canadian. It doesn't SAY NTSC or ""region 1"" anywhere on it but it is, well, it's NTSC for sure, it's either Region 1 or Region free. The cover art is different than anything pictured on Amazon. (I'll post it) And I'm pleasantly surprised by the picture quality. While it's definitely NOT been remastered for DVD, I don't believe it's a VHS dub either. If it is it's damn good one. What it is, I think, it's a commercial burn, (Madacy) using an original, (ether analog or digital tape) ""master"" created for making commercial VHS copies FROM. Vs the original Master Print which could be used to perform effective ""Digital-Remastering"". None of those I suspect, have been preserved. No longer exists. It's not 16X9 but it looks a smidge wider than 4X3. (Further proof the master was intended for VHS) Sound is excellent, Dolby 2.1, best that can expected with what still exists I think. It arrived with the semi-flimsy case kinda busted up but the inserts were still fine so replacing the case was no wup. I haven't talked about the movie itself. I figure most of ya'll here are here because you already know the film and will be more concerned with the technicals. What I think of the movie is in my star rating.",1389398400,,1845,4.51044776119403
7901053,1,837782003X,"I did not like the fact that it is an ""international"" version, but sold here in America where it will not work, unless you have a newer model dvd player that plays dvd from both home and abroad",1358035200,,193,4.105263157894737
7901054,1,837782003X,I received the item and was unfortunately unable to enjoy it due to a lack of compatibility with my equipment :(,1341792000,,112,4.380952380952381
7901055,5,837782003X,"This is a strange brew of a film.  But everyone acting in it seemed perfect for their role.  Dennis Hopper plays the leader of a rag-tag group of Vietnam vets who earn their living by operating a pirate TV station - relying solely on viewer support.  And, they're tough pirates to catch.  Their studio is located in the innards of an old B29 aircraft that seems to be perpetually in-flight (refueling is not discussed).  Also, rather than having a regular broadcast schedule, the pirate station ""inserts"" its programming into the programming of legit TV stations by blocking/replacing their signals.  It's their way of making ""their truths"" (as they see them) available to the public at large.

Their foe is a U.S. Senator - Mrs. Willa Westinghouse.  Westinghouse wants to be President.  And she's running on a platform of re-arming the military with a dose of conservative Christianity added to the mix for good measure.  The pirates, however, see her as a danger - a politician who could lead the U.S. into future wars like Vietnam.  So, the pirates do whatever they can to interrupt or ""corrupt"" her political broadcasts.  In the meantime, Westinghouse uses her friendship with the military to convince them that the pirates need to be shot down.

Unfortunately for Mrs. Westinghouse, the pirates aren't ""ordinary"" Vietnam vets.  They're former ""psy-ops"" (psychological warfare) experts.  And, the film turns into a race against time - with the pirates trying to get some kind of proof of corruption or malfeasance on her part before they get shot down - evidence that will permanently derail her campaign.

One follow-up note.  The DVD I got (from an Amazon partner) did not seem like a VHS transfer.  The picture and audio quality were spot-on.  And, I feel fortunate to have acquired this DVD cheaply while it is still available.  The 4:3 aspect ratio, given the time it came out, was expected.  And I'm guessing it's the original theatrical aspect ratio as it was when it first appeared at the Cannes Film Festival in 1986.",1327363200,4,2030,4.894428152492669
7901056,3,837782003X,"If you are desparately seeking the ""riders of the storms"" like I am, buy this DVD at once.

I had an old french SECAM VHS tape of the movie lost somewhere in the attic and never watched it since... (oh my god !)

I loved this movie since day one !

BUT :

The video quality sucks. That's why I gave it only a 3-star rate.

If your are planing on replacing your old VHS by this DVD, don't buy this because it seems to be VHS master.

Now it's up to you to decide what to do. Remember the WHO's song (and others), the Eugene Lipinsky's wheelchair, Michael J Pollard going bananas, Dennis Hopper as the ""captain"". All together stuck in a bomber with this last job :

Find the dirt to put Mrs Westinghouse off her inauguration.",1143849600,,723,4.158273381294964
