8157243,3,B000KJTGE2,"Good performances from all the cast, especially Ericson. The downside was that it didn't portray much human drama. Would have liked to see some scenes with Floyd's family and more about the harshness of life in Depression Oklahoma.",1511568000,,231,5.105263157894737

8157246,2,B000KJTGE2,"PLOT: Charles ""Pretty Boy Floyd"" poorly done bio.

Pretty Boy Floyd aka Charles Floyd starts young by theft and one jail stay. He moves on to boxing and then decides he likes money. He begins his bank robbery ""spree"". He is a shares his stolen ""wealth"" with the poor of his home state of Oklahoma. This means the backwoods folks often hide him and decides he is a ""hero"" in spite of being public enemy #1~  This is a lousy movie. Cheap sets, over acting and bad plot make it at best a 2 STAR movie. Maybe worth watching once. 2 stars~",1438646400,3,534,4.2254901960784315
8157247,4,B000KJTGE2,"I was surprised how accurate this movie was in comparison to real life. I happen to be very good friends with a living relative of Charles Floyd, namely his sister's granddaughter. The movie did a great job of portraying actual events, from the way that he avenged himself on his father's murderer to his death in an Ohio orchard after robbing a bank in my home town and giving the FBI the clue they needed to track him down. Even as old as this movie is, and how relatively poor the quality of the cinematography was compared with modern standards, it was still quite watchable and engaging.",1426896000,3,592,4.542056074766355

8157250,2,B000KJTGE2,"Run of the mill video. Fair copy but nothing to write home about. Kind of lost interest halfway through, but managed to stay awake till the finish.",1390262400,2,147,4.481481481481482
8157251,1,B000KJTGE2,Did not come close to what his life was about...A lot of the people and incidents were made up. Very boring also.,1266105600,7,113,4.181818181818182
