7883258,3,6305103275,"A decent movie adaption of the 1974 series but it's not as good.  Problem is, the original series are not available in the U.S. as they are in Japanese or Italian format - and possibly other languages.

Here, while the action sequences and animation aren't up to par with the original series, the movie does give a nice modernized spin to the karate chopping, shape shifting, Japanese superhero.  The dialogue is very funny in certain parts as well.",1226448000,,449,4.730769230769231
