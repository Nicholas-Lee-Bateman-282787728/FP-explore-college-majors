I remember when it actually happened, the news headlines, court room dramas, later second inquests and ""wanna be"" forensic scientists without qualifications who are legends in their own minds. Many, many years later the dvd comes out. Did she really do it, or was the dingo the sole perpetrator, or did she do it with the dingo's help (a cunning plan for a cunning bitch perhaps)(Keep in mind there are a lot of cross breeds out there too, and what better way to have a reason for a dingo cull which happened afterwards). Not all facts are shown on the dvd, one cruical fact is missing. That fact gave her the motive. Other motives are present too, on both sides, and white man against black man. Who do you believe! If you want a mind twister and can read between the lines get this dvd if you still can.",1257206400,,831,4.473684210526316
