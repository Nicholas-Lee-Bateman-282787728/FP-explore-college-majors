7873300,5,6304479808,"Spin Out was rated a 5 star movie because it came in very good condition. Elvis is a race car driver and Bill Bixby, as another driver, is his opponent. In a major race Elvis comes in second place but at the final race in the movie Elvis and Bill really fly around the track. Elvis is the winner.",1363305600,,296,4.033898305084746
7873301,4,6304479808,"This movie was not and will not be remembered as great cinema... but one of the 50 worst films of all time?  Terrible?  You have got to be kidding.
  Simply put,  if you don't like Elvis, you won't like this movie.  If you are a fan of modern movies containing gratuitous violence, nudity, foul language and etc, you should avoid this movie because I guarantee you will not like it.  BUT, if you want a innocuous, family film with fun music and a star who could charm the birds right out of the trees,  you will enjoy this movie.
  Was Elvis out of touch in the mid and late 60's? YES.  And I for one am glad he was and appreciate the fact that he made music and movies that were entertaining, light-hearted and able to be played in the same room with children. In the 60's, Elvis' movies helped to create an escapism from a world that seemed to be falling apart and represented a gentler, more innocent time.

 CORNY?...YES!,  COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER?...DEFINITELY!,  but a bad movie...NO!  Compared to other star vehicles of the day (Frankie and Annette,  Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin's Matt Helm films, Don Knotts, and etc) it is a very good movie.",1077494400,5,1146,4.458937198067633
7873302,5,6304479808,"""Spinout"" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In ""Spinout"" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on ""The Donna Reed Show"". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single.",1037059200,2,722,4.395522388059701
7873303,3,6304479808,"Some will have you believe that Spinout was one of Elvis' worst movies (out of 33). Then again, some thing ""Stay Away Joe"" wasn't absolutely miserable. They're all wrong.
Elvis movies are made up of music, girls, fairly interesting characters, and lots of Elvis. This movie covers every area.
Look at the music. ""Adam & Evil"", ""Stop, Look, and Listen"", ""I'll Be Back"", ""Am I Ready"", and even the title song, ""Spinout"" are all good songs. The first three songs I mentioned, I absolutely love.
The movie takes place in Santa Barbara, but you wouldn't know it by watching the movie. That's a shame. Santa Barbara has mountains on one side and ocean on the other. State Street and the Beach are really, really cool. But they're never seen, and that's because the Foxhugh's and a racetrack are keeping Elvis from shopping and rollerblading down the sidewalk. He doesn't even have time to get an ice cream cone at the end of the pier! That's harsh.
Three characters in this movie come from the Donna Reed show, which was my favorite sitcom of all time: Carl Betz, Shelly Fabares, and Jimmy Hawkins, who started out on Donna Reed playing Mary's (Fabares) love interest, but by the end of the show's run, ended up being pals with Jeff (Mary's younger brother). Fast forward to Spinout. Fabares is a hot little brunette, Betz is her hip Daddy-O, just like in Donna Reed, and you even have Deborah Walley from Beach Blanket Bingo and Ski Party.
The movie will fascinate you as you won't be able to figure out how someone as cute as Deborah Walley (who was a hottie in Ski Party and Beach Blanket Bingo) can be so unappealing in this movie. But she is, which is unfortunate considering she's in competition with Fabares (who had excellent chemistry with Elvis in Girl Happy) and Diane McBain, a nationally known author and sexy older woman, who finds gypsy livin' Elvis to be the perfect American male...and wants to marry him because of it. Considering where Elvis has his gigs, I'm surprised this well known authoress has even heard of Mike (Elvis). But explanations are an afterthought in Elvisland. And rightly so.
Three women want to marry Elvis. Each one makes out with Elvis. Two women make him dinner. One woman runs him off the road into a creek. That pretty much levels the playing field as Walley isn't even cute in this movie, and McBain is too old.
Somehow, someway, through music, racing, kissing, and conivery, everything works out. And by the time Elvis is singing ""I'll Be Back"" with Jo from ""Easy Come, Easy Go"", the King of Rock n Roll and Racing (four racing movies, four movies where he's top dog on the track (or water) has everything figured out.
This movie makes you take a look at your values. And if that's not all, the auto racing scenes in the movie are better than Clambake's boat race and Speedway's ovals.
This movie rates among the best of Elvis' movies in music. It pairs Elvis with Fabares for the second of three movies. The ending is better than that of Viva Las Vegas, and Elvis still gets to be gritty.
All the formula ingredients for a fun movie. No reason to dislike it. Those who do have inner issues to deal with.",1017100800,5,3144,4.596085409252669
7873304,4,6304479808,"""I'm not going to marry you, I'm not going to marry her, I'm staying single, single, single, single, single."" That is what Mike McCoy (Elvis Presley) is tring to do. Mike has 3 girls wanting to marry him. (The 3rd person will start later on in the film).
An author named Diana St. Clair (Diane McBain) wants to marry Mike McCoy. She writes books, like Ten Ways to Trap a Bachler and the mating habits of the single male. While that a millionairess name Cynthia Foxhugh (Shelly Fabares) wants to marry him too.
Her father (Carl Betz) wants her to marry his worker named Philip (Warren Berlinger). Like Girl Happy, Elvis sings with a combo. This time the combo is made up of Les, Curly and Larry, (Deborah Walley, Jack Mullaney, Larry Hawkins, Girl Happy).
Cynthia claims she gets everything she wants. She even gets her old man to pretend to kick Mike and his combo out of town. A police officer (Will Hutchins) shows up.
Mike asks if they can leave in the morning, and the police officer replies, ""Sure, who does he think he is kicking people out of town in the middle of the night.""
He is Cynthia's old man.
But soon thier is trouble when Les makes a move on Mike. But does he stay single or marry one of the 3 girls? Watch to find out.",984182400,3,1237,4.359307359307359
7873305,2,6304479808,"SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.
Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled  brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own  drummer (Deborah Walley).
The music is actually listenable in this  picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and  ""I'll Be Back"".
Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this  one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair  looks like a big black ball on his head.
Again, not QUITE the worst, but  far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first.",960768000,5,685,5.008849557522124
7873306,1,6304479808,"The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2)  Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg;  and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues  ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant.",959904000,8,315,5.659574468085107
