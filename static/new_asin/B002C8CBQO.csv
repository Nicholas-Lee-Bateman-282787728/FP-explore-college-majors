8363568,3,B002C8CBQO,"99 starts in the year 99 and shows Cyrus Broacha as Zaramud and Kunal Khemu as Sachin on the run from the police because they have been busted in a SIM card cloning case. On the run they steal a Mercedes which belongs to AGM played by Mahesh Manjrekar and thus they end up being hunted and wind up eventually working for him as money collectors. They come to Delhi on a collection assignment and get embroiled in match fixing. The movie derives a lot of its inspiration from the old crime capers where confusions and mistaken identities run galore but falls short. If you watched just the first 30 minutes you would think that this 99 is definitely getting a 100 but.....I would settle for about 65. Mahesh Manjrekar is good, so is Vinod Khanna. Boman Irani is the best of the cast. All I can say that it this movie is interesting in parts. 3 stars. 3/7/10",1268006400,,856,4.389937106918239
8363569,4,B002C8CBQO,"This movie reminded me of Khosla ka Ghosla and Jane Bhi Do Yarron. Great acting by all -- especially the supporting characters. All in all it was a good fun comedy.

Story follows two small-time crooks who get stuck into the whirlpool of betting and cricket match fixing. Very little gori violence or maladrama usually so ever-present in Hindi movies. No songs either, I did not miss them ( I don't mind songs, I actually love them). There are some predictable moments, but a good gripping plot. A mild love story is somewhere in between. Mainly this is a comedy movie and carried nicely by Boman Irani alone, two lead charcters are not bad either.",1262736000,,648,4.6347826086956525
