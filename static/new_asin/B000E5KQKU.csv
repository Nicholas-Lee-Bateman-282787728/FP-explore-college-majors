8105838,4,B000E5KQKU,"I do not understand why this movie gets so much hate! I thoroughly enjoyed it! The story is full of hilarious black humor, and the relationships are complicated and interesting. I thought all of the acting was quite good and the music very enjoyable. Rik Mayall gets to show off his serious acting chops, breaking away from the manic creations of shows like ""The Young Ones"" and ""Bottom."" He creates a character who is thoroughly sympathetic and charming despite spending most of the movie attempting to murder the woman he loves. Jane Horrocks is alternately hilarious, annoying, and touching as his target and the object of his affections. Their chemestry is INCREDIBLE. They absolutely burned up the screen! If I have one quibble with the movie, I wish it had focused on their relationship a little more. There is a lot of food for thought buried beneath some of the silliness, questions about identity and the willingness to sacrifice your true self for the sake of fame. I think it might have been a better movie had some of that been focused on more. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film that does not deserve quite the amount of scorn that has been heaped upon it.",1410307200,,1173,4.699029126213592
8105839,1,B000E5KQKU,I am sorry I bought it; what a waste of money and time. Predictable made for television junk. Jane Horricks is a wonderful actor but has chosen poorly the films she has starred in. She would be better off for having passed on this.,1221177600,,231,4.2727272727272725
