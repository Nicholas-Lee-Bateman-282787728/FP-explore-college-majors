8340657,3,B001T6YKKU,"I enjoy Asian film because the stories are superior to anything Hollywood has been grinding out since the mid-'70's.  Unfortunately, this one was a little disappointing. This comedy/tear-jerker about a thrice-widowed mother of 12 children zips along for the first hour or so. It's the many-times told rag-to-riches-to-rags story about a struggling mom who wants her kids to respect her (they forget her 46th birthday) so she keeps working to find a job that will make her kids look up to her. Half-way through the film she eventually gets a pretty good job, no less than the President of the Philippines (I told you it was a comedy) but then it starts to drag. She's too busy (and always ""too tired"") to give her kids any motherly attention as she had more than enough time to do when they were poor. There's an assassination plot, a plan to overthrow  her administration, and a zany personal secretary (""Best Friend"") who runs around making things for the President crazier by the day (I stress the word, 'crazy' - not 'funny'). Just when I began to lose interest in the story, the crying started. I mean, a LOT of crying. I think the remaining 45 minutes were full of some of the most hilarious scenes in the film. The writers, actors, and director surely didn't intend for it to turn out this way, but the story is so poorly contrived by this point, that you don't even care about the characters. Everyone's crying and telling stories to try to make you cry, but in all the tears, I could only find humor - stark raving hilarity. Unfortunately this sequel is not the greatest, but it was good enough to watch on a Saturday night with my significant other, hence the three stars I more than graciously give it. This poorly-concocted movie could have turned out  to be much better. For one example, Ida (the mother) finally becomes a chamber maid to the current President of the Philippines. They become friends, and it is heart-warming and almost believable as these two middle-aged women strike up a friendship in the kitchen late one night after bumping into each other. Then they kill off the President. Dumb. There are several 'stubs' like this along the way, so if you are really into Asian comedies, this may not be your cup of tea, but if you enjoy loving bad movies made poorly and for all the unintentional humor along the way, you might want to check this out. Don't bring a hanky for this sniffle bag, bring a pail.",1235260800,,2428,4.6157407407407405
