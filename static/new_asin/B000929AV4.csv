2260464,3,B000929AV4,"When you stop to consider the Saved By The Bell franchise spans 15-seasons across multiple spin-offs (Good Morning Miss Bliss, The College Years, The New Class and so on), it can be a bit confusing to put a sense of order into the many releases.

That said, The New Class Season 3 is, as the name suggests, the third season of The New Class and the ninth season of Saved By The Bell if you're using 1988's Good Morning Miss Bliss as a starting point.

TNC Season 3 originally aired between 1995-1996 Saturday mornings on NBC and is typically regarded as an even lower point of the franchise than the season that preceded it. When the original gang moved on, NBC had contracted just two seasons of The New Class as well as two seasons of The College Years for prime time. When fans rejected the first season of The New Class, some pretty drastic changes were made during the off-season. In fact half of season one's cast were swapped out and the original show's geek Screech (Dustin Diamond) was brought on board in effort to bridge the gap between The New Class and The College Years; trouble is by Season 3 of the New Class, The College Years had already been cancelled.

Season 3 carried on the tradition of axing half the cast and keeping Screech and Belding in the foreground as a bumbling slapstick duo.  This time however Swiss lead character Brian Keller (Christian Oliver), Megan Jones (Bianca Lawson), and Bobby Wilson (Spankee Rodgers) are history without so much as a mention and in their place are the following characters; all said to have come over to Bayside from rival high school Valley: Ryan Parker (Richard Lee Jackson), Maria Lopez (Samantha Esteban) and RJ ""Hollywood"" Collins (Salim Grant).

Well, where does all of this leave us?  The Valley/ Bayside rivalry angle doesn't last long in this season despite a pretty solid initial set-up.  In fact by the end of the first few episodes, the new characters are pretty quickly slid into the slots left behind by the actors from Season 2.

What the show lacks in plotting and clever writing, it overcompensates for with bumbling and drops in character IQ.  The duo of Belding and Screech somehow manage to lower the bar with their apparent cluelessness but the biggest tragedy here may be the degeneration of the Tommy D character (Jonathan Angel) from tough, greaser to lumbering fool.  Why, considering the Screech/ Belding dynamic already added an unbearable degree of ignorance to the formula, the show's creative staff decided to downgrade Tommy D to a similar state is truly anybody's guess.

Additionally, while public outcry over casts that too closely mimicked the original gang were well documented and valid, the schemes of Ryan Parker are a far cry from the cleverness and entertainment found in Zack Morris's finer moments.

In keeping in the tradition of TNC Season 2, the 26-episodes that comprise this set do everything they can to keep the stories as far from the classroom as possible.  Part-time job episodes set at the mall, excursions to a ski resort, even a two-month semester spent on the deck of a cruise ship all add up to convince viewers that California high school students must have the most lenient scholastic requirements the world has ever known.

Sadly, even the few episodes that actually take place in the high school center on non-classroom oriented situations in favor of planning for musicals, plays, parades sporting competitions and so on.

Additionally this is perhaps one of the most ""moral lesson"" oriented of all the seasons with heavy-handed lessons integrated within nearly every episode: Maria convinces Screech to pass her in driver's ed only to crash, Tommy and Lindsay take up smoking, date-rape gets addressed when Rachel starts going out with a college guy, poverty even judging a person based on physical challenges gets tackled here.

Of course while my review seems loaded with complaints, the fact of the matter is there are a few enjoyable moments and lighthearted moments that make this season worthy of anybody's Saved by the Bell collection.  For one thing this season would be the end of many long-standing characters (Lindsay and Tommy D) and represents the RJ Collins character's only foray in the franchise despite some genuinely humorous moments.

The season that would follow it would actually end being a step in the right direction and perhaps that fact can be attributed to the feeling one gets that the writers had simply run out of ideas for this particular group's dynamic.",1322179200,,4512,4.875816993464053
2260465,3,B000929AV4,"School is back in session at good ol' Bayside high on Saved By The Bell: The New Class - Season 3. Out this season are Megan Jones, Brian Keller, and Bobby Wilson. In are schemer Ryan Parker (Richard Lee Jackson), sassy Maria Lopez (Samantha Becker), and starstruck R.J. ""Hollywood"" Collins (Salim Grant). Initially shunned for being arch-rival Valley high transfers, the new three inevitably befriend returning regulars Lindsay, Tommy D, and Rachel in ""Welcome to Bayside"". Dustin Diamond is back also as an even geekier administrative assistant Screech, adopting a Laurel & Hardy-esque rapport with Principal Belding. Activities outside of the school this season include jobs for the gang at the Palisades Mall, a trip to Sleepy Mountain ski lodge run by Screech's Grandpa Ernie, and a ""semester at sea"" aboard a cruise ship.

Guest stars include: Winifred Freeman (Mr. Belvedere) as Mabel in ""Boundaries""; Corbin Allred (Teen Angel) as Franklin in ""The Principal's Principles""; Kristen Miller (USA High, She Spies) and Gabrielle Union (Bring It On, Bad Boys II) as Robin and Hilary respectively in ""The Christmas Gift"".

The audio is fine and consistent with the previous sets while the video quality (again, somewhat lacking but acceptable) is apparently the best that Image Entertainment can muster.

2260466,4,B000929AV4,"I think this was the best of all the seasons. I like Lydnsey and Rachel a lot!. Now that is my hormones speaking, but I just though this was the season it gelled. Now I am probably more attached to this season then any other in SBTB history though I have seen it all. Why? This is the season that got me hooked. It was just funny and kinda (should I admit this) sexy",1147996800,2,366,3.9594594594594597
2260467,2,B000929AV4,"I actually think this is the second to worst season of the new class.(season one being the worst) Tommy D, RJ, and Lindsay were all god awful in this season. Ryan helped the show a lot, most notablly in seasons 4 and 5, but he is over shadowed by the previous 3 mentioned. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Saved by the Bell, I would skip this season and check out the new class seasons 4-7.",1130198400,,389,4.131578947368421
