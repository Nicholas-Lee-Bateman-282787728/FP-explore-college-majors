8156464,4,B000KGGO9K,"This DVD primarily discussed how the large and antiquated NYC subway system is maintained. It also includes a segment which describes the construction of the San Francisco BART subway system (which was quite an arduous task, given the fact that San Fran lies on the San Andreas Fault). The last part of the DVD talks about the East Side Access project (a tunnel linking the LIRR to Grand Central Terminal). The tunnel was supposed to be completed back in 2012, but it won't be completed until 2022 (if it's ever completed). This isn't the fault of the DVD.

I wish the DVD covered the DC Metro, given the fact that it's the second busiest system in the country. Overall, however, this DVD was great.",1516492800,,699,4.637096774193548
