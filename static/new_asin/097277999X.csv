It's designed for digital photographers, and is applicable to pretty much any digital SLR (less so for compact cameras as they tend to make all the exposure calculations for you, and don't give as much control).

A good introduction to zone systems and digital exposure, but two points off for the low quality production.",1300924800,3,963,5.0125
