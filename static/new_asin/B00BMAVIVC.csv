5647169,5,B00BMAVIVC,If you have studied and lost contact with your teacher this is the best video for review and refresher. I highly recommend; clear and the grid he uses is the best for perfect direction of the moves,1398384000,13,197,4.351351351351352
5647170,5,B00BMAVIVC,"Dr. Chuckrow has created a dvd version of his terrific video on Master Cheng Man-ch'ing's T'ai-chi short form. I've owned the video for some years and wanted to upgrade to the dvd version.
Dr. Chuckrow's approach is very thorough. He has broken the program into 3 parts. The first part we get to see Dr. C performing the 37 step form from the front with some relaxing music as background.
The second part is an excellent and thorough teaching of each step in the form. Dr. C has done something here I'd never seen before on any t-ai chi video and that is to do the form on a grid that he created on the floor. This provides even greater clarity of direction and movement. Interesting to is that Dr. Chuckrow for the most part narrates each and every movement with a little voice over as well, while doing the form and gives very thorough instruction all the way. The explanations and examples given are extremely helpful.
In the third part Dr. Chuckrow does the form once again; but this time you see him from the back as if you were following along with him in a class.
Although nothing is as good as taking personal instruction, this dvd comes as close as one can to taking a personally taught class from one of Master Cheng's original western students.
You can be a new or old student to this form and do quite well. I've lived for years now in one of those rare areas that literally has no t'ai chi classes nearby, so this for me is a most valuable tool in keeping up with my practice.",1372809600,34,1489,4.359712230215828

8570740,5,B00BMAVIVC,"This is the only dvd I could find for the Chang Man-ching set. Chuckrow has been doing tai chi for decades. He is a good instructor, but a dvd will teach you the forms but to really learn tai chi a good instructor is a must. That said, this is a helpful tool.",1513987200,,259,3.9056603773584904
8570741,5,B00BMAVIVC,"The DVD was very well thought out, how it is broken down into three parts helps the learning process greatly. The first part shows the form at normal speed. The timing of Dr. Robert Chuckrow's  movements and explanation in the second part of some of the subtleties of the form makes it a DVD of great value, you will see how it is a true study of motion. The third view is a rear view of the form as if learning in a class. Very well done and highly recommend. Thank You  !
Sincerely Jim McElroy",1504656000,2,495,4.145833333333333
8570742,5,B00BMAVIVC,"Great tai chi product; good for instruction, fine tuning, or regular practice.  The first part executes and describes the form and is really detailed -- very helpful for new students or those who want to brush up on fine points.  The second and third parts show the whole form from the front and back, which allows one to see what's going on from pretty much all vantage points -- critical for learning and review.  Showing the form from the back, it's worth mentioning, in and of itself, is a really great idea since it removes the mirror image problem and allows the viewer to follow along and do the whole form uninterrupted with the dvd.  This recreates the classroom / group environment, which is super for those who need help pacing or just want a break from doing the form on their own.

8570746,5,B00BMAVIVC,"There is no way I would be making such rapid progress without Dr. Chuckrow's DVD. Both the video and the verbal instructions are very helpful The way the DVD is divided into three sections is also helpful....Form at normal speed, form instruction and rear view of form. Very professional.",1416873600,8,288,4.8979591836734695
8570747,3,B00BMAVIVC,"This instructional video has some good ideas, but they are not well executed. The main question is, can you learn Cheng Man Ching's Tai Chi Chuan 37 form from this video. Yes, you can. But you will have to be patient with the teaching method and video production of Sifu Chuckrow. Also, I would highly advise that you get all of Cheng Man Ching's books on his method, especially ""Master Cheng's New Method of Taichi Ch'uan Self-Cultivation."" This book in particular shows the foot work involved, which is very important. Also you should see videos of Dr. Cheng doing his form on youtube. They are old and awful quality, but indispensable to get the original feel for it's practice.
In this video, Sifu Chuckrow has taped lines on the floor so that you can see the angles of his feet. Great idea. He refers to them often. But then he will jump around to a different angle, and carry on, which is quite confusing. As the video goes on, he tends to not mention some of the foot movements, that he can be seen doing.
Having a larger space and moving the camera would have been better. A few times he goes out of frame, then says ""re-positioning"" and backs up to do it again. For a total beginner, these things are confusing.
At times it appears that he can't quite remember what comes next. OK, I understand that he is talking, paying attention to shooting the video and all, but he could have redone and edited those segments. One segment suddenly has a voice over, apparently to correct something, then goes back to normal.
During ""Repulse Monkey"" he says that ""officially"" it is done 5 times, but can be done for 3 repetitions. Perhaps Dr. Cheng mentioned this in one of his actual classes, but in his books, and his videos, it is done 3 times. Where did the ""official"" 5 reps come from?
Some minor points: This is a production he is selling. His attire did not seem suited for doing Tai Chi Chuan as he kept having to adjust his pant legs. And whats in his pocket?
Recently, as of Sept. 2014, Sifu Mike Pekor has posted a video on youtube, showing a complete instructional set for Dr. Cheng's Tai Chi Chuan 37. This is very easy to follow, done in a spacious, well lit gym using the painted floor lines for orientation, and explaining a number of nuances not covered in Sifu Chuckrow's video.
Like I said, you can learn the form from this video, just be patient, rewind often, and work out his directional orientation. I live in a very small town, and there is literally no Tai Chi Chuan instruction done here. Having an accurate video from a qualified instructor is a must.",1414800000,13,2574,4.490405117270789
8570748,5,B00BMAVIVC,"I like this DVD, I can play it over and over again and maybe memorize the form ... it is well done.",1400112000,7,99,3.5454545454545454
