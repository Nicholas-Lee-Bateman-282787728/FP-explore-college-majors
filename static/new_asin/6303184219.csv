599752,4,6303184219,"Max Ophul's The Earrings of Madame De... is an essential film. Filled with Ophul's magical camara work and fine performances all around it is a film to be watched and cherished by all serious film goers.

The film tells the story of a love triangle between Madame de (Danielle Darrieux), her husband  (Charles Boyer) and an Itallian diplomat (Vittorio de Sica). On its face its a soap opera plain and simple but if one goes beyond the surface, the film is a play on the upper crust morals of Viennese society. Love is a thing that can be toyed with but never possessed. The earrings of the title enter the story on four occassions: first when they are seemingly unimportant and sold by Madame to pay some debts. They are then sold back to her husband who gives them to his mistress as she leaves for Constantinople. Sold there to once again pay gaming debts they come into the possession of Baron Fabrizio Donati who takes them to France.

The Baron begins a flirtation with Madame which eventually turns to love. He makes a gift of the earrings. The Madame who now cherishes the earrings because of their giver now must face the consequences of her having sold them and lied to her husband. The General demands the Baron take the jewels back and they are once again ought by the General. They make their way to a niece who sells them back to the same merchant. Finally purchased once again by Madame they are left on a church altar as an offering to save the Baron who is now involved in a duel with the General.

The travels of the earrings are used by Ophuls to represent the circularity of life. This favorite device of Ophuls was used in both Lola Montes and La Ronde. This is an excellent film that deserves to be seen. The film for some reason passed into the public domain and there is no American version of a restored print. The version I viewed was by Timeless Media and was truly horrible. The subtitles are often not readable. Much of the film is not translated and the print quality goes from merely bad to truly awful. But unfortunately this is the only version available.

If you want to see one of the greatest films by one of cinema's truly unique directors see this film. I only wish watching it were not so much a chore.

Highly recommended.",1184889600,3,2261,4.4624697336561745
599753,5,6303184219,"I first saw this movie in a dubbed version on the local CBC station.  (One of the benefits of living in a border town with Canada.)  At first I was put off because it seemed to be about the foibles of a rich, silly woman.  But then the camera work drew me in.  I'd never seen a camera move so beautifully.  It wasn't like watching a movie at all but rather eavesdropping on its characters.  Then suddenly this silly woman changes and the movie got darker and the characters more and more complex.  At its end I was so moved that I thought I must remember the title in case I ever get the chance of seeing it in a theatre.  Which I did about 10 years later.  This time in its original form at that temple to movies the Bleecker Street Cinema (alas, gone these many years) in NYC.  The print was probably terrible but that wouldn't have mattered.  If CHILDREN OF PARADISE takes place in the Paris of Balzac MADAME DE is in the Paris of de Maupassant.  It always reminds me of his story USELESS BEAUTY and the director Max Ophuls filmed 3 de Maupassant stories as LE PLAISIR just a few years before.  At the beginning of this movie Madame de hums lightly as she sorts through her jewels & furs looking for something she can sell without regret to pay off some debts which she means to hide from her husband, a general.  She settles on a pair of heart shaped diamond earrings.  'If only he hadn't given them on our wedding day', she muses knowing she will need to invent a very convincing lie to account for their disappearance.  She puts the lie in motion at the opera during a performance of Gluck's ORPHEE.  The irony here is not made apparent until later when Madame de meets a baron, a diplomat, and what begins as just another flirtation, entered knowingly to pass the time & amuse herself, grows and becomes so much more until finally Madame de, her husband & her lover are no longer the players in this tragedy but the played.  At the end the camera fades on the image of the heart shaped earrings placed upon an altar dedicated to the saint she often prayed to.  Max Ophuls isn't much known in this country although his Hollywood film LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN does have a following.  But this film belongs right at the top among the great films:  CITIZEN KANE, SHOESHINE etc. and THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC with whom Madame de might have something in common.  If Danielle Darrieux (Madame de), Charles Boyer (Monsieur de)and Vittorio De Sica (the Baron) have ever been better I should like to know where for THAT I wish to see.  I have kept from discussing plot & character because I think this is a movie that should be discovered on one's own.

I have seen this film at least nine times, and each viewing brings new things to discover and love.  The direction, set decoration, music, cast and photography always delight, but this time around I must also pay tribute to the screenplay.  Knowing it so well I spent time last night really listening to the nuances of the script, in particular that of Charles Boyer's general.  Unlike the showier cleverness of my previous favorite moments (""I don't love you, I don't love you, I don't love you"" must be the most passionate non-declaration of all cinematic history), I admired as if for the first time the restrained, dignified, tragic journey the general takes from amused tolerance to suppressed love to frustration and, finally, a soldier's resort to arms.

 The extras, as mentioned in other reviews, include an interview the author Madame de Vilmorin as well as her original story printed in the booklet. My only dislike is the pretentious commentary about ""the fetish object of the film"", the earrings, ""...defined by Freud as a substitute for the mother's missing phallus"".

600041,5,6303184219,"Edwige Feuilliere and Charles Boyer are an aristocratic couple in Belle poque Paris. Ophuls takes the lady's diamond earrings as a metaphor of their love situation. The earrings, the husband's wedding present to his wife, evolve, in their repeated transitions, from a valuable trinket, to a freighted love token and into a symbol of penance. The male ascendancy is asserted and reasserted, Vittorio de Sica introduces a suave and archetypal love object into the whirling social scene, and the female, in classic mode, pays for her transgression with her life. Taken as fable, satire or romantic potboiler, Ophuls light touch, and Feuilliere's and Boyer's portrayals make for delightful and satisfying viewing.",1388707200,,709,5.396396396396397

What luck to have found such an incredible film by chance at the New York public library!

The French used in the film is formal, but intelligible for the beginner - at least 60% of it is - after the first three viewings. Believe me, this is a film that can be seen again and again. As I continue studying the film, I keep discovering new words and phrases, and reviewing grammatical constructions I learned in class.

Danielle Derrieux is ravishingly exquisite and her costars give equally sublime and nuanced performances. Max Ophuls is an awesome director. What an eye! I cannot wait to see what his other films are like!

600202,5,6303184219,"I had a lot of resistance when I saw the initial Criterion release of a Max Ophuls film. The name ""The Earrings of Madame De......"" left me with little imagination and desire to inquire. The art work seemed daft and calculating. A few months later Criterion came out with three more of his releases with the same poster like art work. Cold sounding foreign names only added to my resistance. Who is this guy anyway? I didn't need him.

After all I was confident in my collection of the French New Wave directors, all the Russian thaw films, Italy's neorealism, the British pre/post WW II, including the Powell and Pressburger films, most of the Japanese stalwarts, plus the American film noir, and lastly, I had the silent films from Litz, Murnau, Pabst, Eisenstein. I even had most of the great Indian films by Satyajit Ray and Mira Narr. Who had time and room for some guy named Max who made period costume epics for dainty old ladies?

His name and films kept coming up though in my continued research and efforts to collect and obtain a decent library of classics, both domestic and worldwide. With the recent big sale from Barnes & Noble I chanced his best known film, the recommended The Earrings of Madame De............

Was I ever in for a surprise. Not only was this one of the best stories of the gem of one's loving devotion, but the tale of its travels and chances of return to the owner time and again provided a powerful story of love, risk, unbridled emotions, thoughtless impulses, incredibly lavish sets, and some of the best camera work regardless of era. Now I know who Max Ophuls is as I have since added Lola Montes to my collection and am now watching Le Plaisir as I write this this. With La Ronde up next. Now I am grateful and humbled into submission. Pleasantly so. He was a true genius whom planned every move, action, words, and sets with incredible attention to details. Thankfully I finally broke through my own stupidity and got with his program sorta' speak. He made wonderful films about the many loves from a different era. One he never experienced, but maybe, subconsciously wished he could time travel too. He certainly gave each film an accurate portrayal as far as look, dress, and language of the times. Each is also engaging with lively dialogue and social banter. There is a sense of humor at play even with the most costly life on edge. His insight into the human dilemma provides fuel for his intense and historically accurate recreations.

Take it from someone whom held steadfast in defiance of being swayed, only to relent to the charms and gifted talents of one Max Ophuls. All his films, especially those from the  Criterion Collection, all of which have lovingly been remastered and loaded with background interviews, historical innuendos, and audio commentaries, this is 1st class film making for your enjoyment plus time after time endless watching. His special treats come highly recommended.",1324339200,4,2945,4.755381604696673
600203,5,6303184219,"Despite finishing the film at nearly midnight and with work looming just hours ahead in the morning, an impromptu discussion was started and we ended up watching much of the film again with the commentary.  Now just be forewarned, this film is so masterfully created and so richly complex, that one can't really help but either discuss it or go back and revisit certain scenes.

Ophuls is masterful at modifying and bringing this short story to life.  Though much has been rewritten and revised from the short story, the heart of the story carries over to the film.  But where the story leaves the reader satisfied, the film leaves the viewer awed.

To sum the film up without any spoilers:  Madame de ... (you never hear her name, but that's unimportant) goes to the  local jeweler to pawn off a pair of earrings she received from her husband, the General, on their wedding day.  She then feigns as though she lost them (so her husband wouldn't find out) and considers the matter closed.  The jeweler, being friendly to the family, sells the earrings back to the General.  He figures that Madame de did not care for them, so he gives them to his lover as she departs for Africa.  His lover then loses the earrings gambling and they are purchased by Donati, an Italian aristocrat.  Donati comes back to Paris, sees Madame de, is smitten, starts a romantic affair and then gifts her the earrings.  This is where the film gets interesting.

Now you might think that all of this sounds a little contrived, but it does not come off that way.  Donati is played wonderfully by Vittorio de Sica (the famous Italian director no less), but the real treat is Danielle Darrieux's portrayal of Madame de.  She captures each and ever nuance of her character so beautifully.  Charles Boyer gives an amazing performance as the General.

The sets are marvelous, and very opulent, with the exception of the beach scene and a later outdoor scene.  That later outdoor scene near the end features de Sica in one of my all time favorite frames in cinema.  But needless to say, Ophuls is a master and it shows.

The only issue I might have is with some of the commentary.  The two ladies are very good at dissecting the film, and I agree with the one lady who feels that Donati and Madame de never actually had physical relations.  I believe that is why the earrings became such a center of focus for her love and desire after Donati gifted them to her.  But the commentary does have a VERY feminist slant and they really bash the General quite a bit, though I think he was the more innocent party; he didn't appear to be 'in love' with his mistress, which was often the case with aristocrats in that era.  He didn't seem to 'break the rules' by actually falling in love like Donati and Madame de did.

Without spoiling anything, the climax was beautiful.  So wonderfully shot, so moving, so tragic.  It's a love story that won't go out of style anytime soon.  If you are a fan of auteur directors or classic foreign cinema, then this is a must see.  Even if this is the first classic French film one sees, one would have to be a stone not to be moved by this complex, touching, and sad tale.  It's in my top 5 classic French films for sure!

PS! Criterion does their normal bang up job on the restoration and transfer. It's amazing what they can do with old films.  And the translation is very nice, and the subtitles easy to read.  Win win win.",1319673600,4,3424,4.4959481361426255
600204,5,6303184219,"This amazing, slippery and sophisticated movie is a meditation on three different and incompatible forms of love -- the light, amusing love of a French general for his beautiful, younger wife (the titular Madame de ...), the playful, slightly sinful love of the Italian diplomat Donati for Madame de ..., and her love of Donati that in time turns to a hopeless reflection on the loss of love due to her flippancy in telling a series of white lies about her earrings.

When Madame de ... tells Donati at first that he must not hope for anything from her, she is playing the game of love, as we see in much of the first part of the film.  She has many suitors, as her husband notes, saying he grows tired of them.  But they are not important either to her or him.  Then Donati starts to have hopes of Madame de ... and, most consequentially, she begins to have hopes that he will be her great love that will take her out of herself.  But her earlier habits of playing the game of love make her lose him, and she withdraws into her own world of memories and ruminations, one that is quite literally hopeless.

Hope can also be seen as a boundary keeping the characters within the limits of their social world.  When Madame de ... gives up hope and becomes a hopeless romantic, she exceeds those limits and ends up losing a great deal. In the movie, love itself is a retrospective, not a prospective, emotion.  Even the general, who is wonderfully played by Charles Boyer, seems to love his wife more once he's lost her to her world of memories. It's a dark view of humanity, but a beautiful movie, beautifully arrayed, staged and acted.  Give yourself a treat and watch it.",1291766400,,1670,4.449180327868852

600206,5,6303184219,"""The Earrings of Madame de"" is set in Paris during the early 20th Century.  It drips with beauty and grace as the elaborate camera shots track the stars and celestial sets through upper class homes and palaces.  Louisa (Danielle Darrieux) is a pampered and frivolous flirtatious wife of General Andre de (Charles Boyer).  She secretly decides to sell the beautiful diamond earrings he gave her on their wedding day to pay off a bothersome debt she has.  This inadvertently sets off a a chain of events that results in a whirlwind affair with an Italian Baron Donati (Vittorio De Sica).

Everything seems right in this movie, the stars, the timing, and an interesting story that shows how fate heads them all toward an ironic ending.  Boyer plays a strict, disciplined masochistic army general that keeps his emotions in check, Danielle Darrieux is a great actress and is  able to show how his frivolous wife, Louisa, evolves through her lies and deep love for Baron Donati.

A lie evolves and once the earrings are first sold, Louisa lies to her husband acting like she lost the earrings at the opera.  This leads to a story of theft and a fuss in Paris.  The jewelers become frightened, and the buyer comes to the General and tells him the truth.  Louisa sold the jewelers the earrings secretly to get cash for debts.  The general buys the earrings back again, not telling his wife, but giving them to his mistress, Lola.  Lola goes to Constantinople and loses everything she has in gambling and barters the earrings for payment.  The Italian Diplomat,  Baron Donati, then  sees them as a deal and buys them in Constantinople and returns to Paris.  Donati meets Louise and the earrings return to her with new meaning.

Overall this beautifully crafted drama is fascinating.  It has an interesting story, perfect casting and the camera tracking elaborate and difficult dance scenes.

600207,5,6303184219,"The Earrings of Madame de... is virtually a miracle of cinematic balance. The film gracefully moves along its comedic gestures towards a critique of aristocratic life.

Yup, Louise de Vilmorin herself dumps on the movie but good.  She says ""wrong"" (faux) so many times I lost track.  Apparently, Ophuls initially handed her a treatment for the movie that she thought was fine, then producers didn't think that was commercial enough and they had the story changed in so many ways that it no longer resembled the book.  de Vilmorin pulls no punches in her critique and the points are all well taken.

I too found the whole business hard to believe and not the least bit romantic.  The ending is awful and about as cliche as it gets.  The idea that a French general would challenge an Italian diplomat to a duel is just silly.  Why?  Can you spell ""international incident""?  There is no way the French Foreign Ministry would have allowed such foolishness, nor would a senior military officer even consider such behavior in real life = court martial.  Yes, I know there are stupid generals but the general in the film is not stupid.

This story was filmed again in 2001 with Carole Bouquet in the title role, and that's a much better movie.  Gone are the annoying tracking shots, there is no silly duel, and the ending actually make sense, ditto the moral of the story, which is what can happen when pride is put ahead of love.

600328,5,6303184219,"Even without the great performances of Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux as General de.... and his wife, even without the superlative use of camera movement and mise-en-scene, this famous 1953 Max Ophuls melodrama would be worth seeing just for its spectacular sets and costumes of the Parisian Belle Epoque (although based on a novella by Louise Leveque de Vilmorin, the setting is the same beau monde as in Proust's fiction). The wealthy spoiled beautiful wife of a titled French general, the title heroine (Darrieux) pawns the diamond earrings her husband gave her as a wedding present; the earrings change hands again and again, acquiring different meanings altogether as they circulate, and come back several times into the hands of Madame de...; they represent the only stability in her world of evanescent pleasures and loyalties and values. As the earrings travel we see Madame de... grow up and become first the celebrant--and then the victim--of her own mature passion for a titled Italian diplomat (the film director Vittorio de Sica). Few actors could have carried off this metamorphosis as believably and as poignantly as Darrieux, who genuinely makes us feel for the unfaithful heroine after her lover leaves her for insulting his honor; Boyer, as her well-meaning husband (who is slow to wrath but who can arrive at it eventually) is equally fine. As with most Ophuls films, it begins with an unforgettable sequence (a lengthy POV shot of Madame de... moving in and among her beautiful wardrobe, deciding which among her opulent effects to pawn) that is equaled by other effortless shots that show his incredible mastery of camera movement. The adjoining bedrooms and boudoirs of Boyer's and Darrieux's form one of the most gorgeous sets ever devised for a film; the way the camera moves through it is almost heartstoppingly beautiful.",1243123200,2,1852,5.135761589403973

600331,5,6303184219,"Anyone could see that Louise was an attractive but frivolous woman. Ensnared on her own volition in a loveless marriage to an aristocrat general, who showers her with fine furs and jewelry, and abides her petty flirtations whilst always maintaining the decorum proper for a military nobleman in high society, Louise too, adheres to the dictates and protocol demanded of a nobleman's wife in the elaborate, but meaningless and empty milieu in which she resides. Louise is a comely and innocuous creature, prone to fainting spells, whose marriage to the philandering Count is unremarkable and unmemorable. But into this very shallow, unremarkable existence, Louise will find passion, and it will complicate her life, and eventually destroy it.

MADAME de...opens with Max Ophuls' fluid camera taking Louise's viewpoint as it scans her jewelry cases, and wardrobe, searching for something of considerable value to sell. The woman has rung up a large debt, and she loathes to ask her husband for the money. Reluctantly, she decides on a pair of heart shaped diamond earrings, a wedding gift from her husband that she is not particularly fond of. The sale of those earrings sets in motion a chain of events that will lead Louise down a fateful road, where desire, misunderstanding, and deception, will culminate in tragedy. She finds love but at a drastic cost. In an Ophuls film, passionate love is a thing of beauty, the antidote to a shallow existence, the inspiration for art, and for life itself. It is also a kind of sickness that often clouds one's better judgement, causes one to neglect responsibilities and make rash, sometimes fatal decisions.

MADAME de..., Ophuls finest film, and one of the greatest ever made, is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. It is so perfectly crafted, and there are many subtleties that can be overlooked on an initial viewing. For example, it took a second viewing for me to realize that the earrings, although carried earlier through various peregrinations by Louise, the Count, his mistress, and Donati, were not fully shown in closeup until Louise's lover, Baron Donati, gave them to her as a token of his love. Once that happens, they take on a special significance, not only for Louise, who looks on them as a surrogate for her lover, but for her husband, who now associates them with his wife's infidelity and the man who is responsible for it. The Count becomes a complicated figure who remarks at one point to Louise that their marriage is in reality, superficially superficial. He may still have feelings for her, or perhaps a mixture of love and guilt, but his wounded pride will lead to actions that will ultimately destroy any hope of reconciliation. The Count is the military man and the Baron the diplomat, but it's the Count who tries diplomacy to save the marriage and his self respect until it becomes a hopeless endeavor, while the Baron, upon learning of Louise's duplicity with the earrings, resorts to a militant obstinacy in terminating the affair. Those earrings that Louise at first wanted so desperately to sell that she prayed in church for it, eventually become something she is so desperate to possess that she sells all her furs and jewels to buy back. They represent her lover and the memory of love that she now owns, that her husband cannot touch. In the final tracking sequence of the movie, the camera will return to the same cathedral in which she at first prayed for the sale, and finally, most desperately, for the life of the Baron, and slowly pan from the statue of the saint down to those fateful earrings, given up by Louise to expiate the imagined sin of the affair, and now church property. Poignant symmetry does abound in MADAME de...

To Max Ophuls, movement is life, and elegant tracking shots are of course, a hallmark of his movies. I think they are most effectively done in this film. The aren't as pronounced or exaggerated in MADAME de..There is a musical quality to them, like the waltz theme hummed by Louise in the beginning and repeated throughout the film. A classic example of Ophuls' genius with the moving camera can be found in the legendary ballroom waltz sequence that follows Louise and the Baron. At points in the dance sequence the swirling pair dissolve and reappear in different settings, time frames, from different perspectives, and with nuances in speech and expression, that ingeniously show the deepening of their relationship. Ophuls also delights in repeatedly using things like staircases, windows, doors, candles, and mirrors to facilitate the isolation or coupling of the characters and highlight themes as the plot develops.

MADAME de... is a movie to be enjoyed and marveled at, over and over..and the cast is superb. My God, has there ever been better ensemble acting in a film than what we see here from Danielle Darrieux, Charles Boyer, and Vittorio De Sica? Ophuls does not let his actors go overboard in their performances. No screaming or shouting. The method would be anathema in an Ophuls movie. Everything is under control, but the emotions seethe underneath, and are given away by an arched eyebrow, a turn of phrase, or a longing glance. Like a Mozart composition, everything is outwardly pleasing, but inwardly aching, but unlike Mozart, with Ophuls there are seldom happy endings. There are few exclamation points but many question marks in Ophuls films and MADAME de... is no exception. Was the affair or even the marriage ever consummated? Were the 2 fatalities a fait accompli, or merely a likely possibility? Assumptions and intimations are made, not statements of fact. This is not reality, but cinema, and Ophuls constantly reminds us of it. As a subtext to the major ideas presented in MADAME de...Ophuls deftly touches upon conflicting relationships existing in turn of the century France..between the sexes, between the classes, and even between the military and diplomatic corps. Also to note in this film are the exquisite sets and costume designs. MADAME de...is a work of cinematic art that will stand the test of time.

This Criterion package includes a booklet which contains an essay by noted critic Molly Haskell, as well as the novella (quite different from the movie), written by Louise de Vilmorin, from which the film was adapted. The DVD specials include an amusing interview with an indignant Mme. de Vilmorin (who ridicules the changes made and calls the film boring), interviews with various Ophuls collaboraters, and an introduction by Paul Thomas Anderson which I didn't find very illuminating.

600335,5,6303184219,"Let me start off like this....bear with me...

I detest Hollywood chick flicks.  They are simplistic, childish, silly, and completely unrealistic in their depiction of so-called romance.  The term ""romantic comedy"" makes me nauseaous.  Many friends and family members have come under the erroneous impression that I am not a romantic.  Far from it.  I prefer my romance of the old school, a deep, unshakeable romance, those feelings that if you're open to them, you cannot deny them at all.  A love that comes with maturity, with passion and intelligence, one that is so deep, so knowing, so consuming, so happy yet sad at the same time.  Many try and find this love in a superficial, uncaring world, and many are destroyed by it, others find it and die for it, yet they are the lucky ones.

I see this in the films of Max Ophuls.

The Earrings of Madame de... is one of Ophuls's greatest works.  It's a magnificent film of deep style and even deeper substance, something that is rarely achieved by any filmmaker.  Ophuls's mise en scene, with his incredibly camera work (especially for its time, before the invention of steadicams), beautiful performances, wonderful dialogue, and deep, deep wisdom about how men and women try and destroy each other, yet, must have one another as well.  This film has a small plot thread about a set of earrings that set off a chain of events that spiral out of control and consume the protagonists, and that leads the film to its stunning, unforgettable conclusion.

There's so much to Ophuls's films that it's almost impossible to do them justice in writing about them.  Criterion has released this one and La Ronde, another magnificent work, so if you are a real romantic (not a Hollywood one), you must witness these films.  They may change your life.",1214352000,12,1790,4.7817589576547235

Nevertheless, I'd still rather see this stunted version of 'The Earrings of Madame de...' than not see it at all.  There is an allure here, the possibility of being drawn into another world and another time, that makes me want to watch this again.  I hope we won't have to wait forever for Criterion or whoever to produce a DVD of this movie.

Particularly unforgettable are love and passion between sheer elegance Danielle Darrieux and classic blade Vittorio de Sica during the ballroom scenes. Though, it is safe to say that the main player is a pair of earrings as the title of The Earrings of Madame de indicates.

7841255,5,6303184219,"The General tells his wife that ""unhappiness is an invented thing."" Louisa earlier in their marriage would have agreed with him, when they both had the same view of French society. But love, and the burdens of love, have made her truly unhappy -- something far beyond her ability to communicate, or perhaps even understand.

Making it worse, neither the General nor her lover the Baron can ever understand. This is a story on one level of a love triangle -- as Roger Ebert wrote: This is ""one of the most mannered and contrived love movies ever filmed. It glitters and dazzles, and beneath the artifice it creates a heart, and breaks it.""

This is a film to watch at least twice, once focusing on the love story, a second to focus on its camera movements, its graceful style, its sets, its costumes and jewelry. And its writing: I always answered your letters, my love--but I lacked the courage to mail them.

One of my greatest movie experiences.

This movie played beautifully as it was downloaded from Amazon over a very fast home WIFI server and onto my Lenovo ThinkPad. Both sound and images were perfectly sharp and defined.

7841256,5,6303184219,"There are plenty of things that films, especially older films can do to portray various aspects of the lives of people who have inhabited this wicked old world. The film under review, Max Ophuls The Earrings of Madame de is almost a perfect expression of the Belle Epoque, the period of peace and stability for the upper crust before the ugly storm of World War I washed away all such illusions that the industrial age would bring unencumbered  progress and benefits to the Western world. To show rather graphically how the ill-thought out consequences of the moral decay of the period would bring the flower of the European youth to its knees before that conflict was over. At another level this film, for those who want to shy away from the political storms, represents an exceptional example of a master filmmaker at work using one simple thread to tell his story, to tell of the consequences of what the headline to this review points out-when you first practice to deceive-watch out for the blowback.

For those who want to accept the film for its latter view here is how things came to such a nasty personal end. Madame de (and the beauty of this film other than as an example of the decadent French aristocracy is we never learn, never need to learn really the rest of Madames surname-a brilliant stroke), played by Daniele Darrieux, a big star of the French cinema in the post-World War II period, a flighty and self-indulgent wife of a count and General in the French Army, played by Charles Boyer, in the post-Paris Commune period was in hock up to her pretty eyebrows to a party (or parties) unknown. To get out from under dear Madame had hocked an expensive pair of earrings that the good General had given her as a heartfelt wedding gift. From there it is a question of following the bouncing ball, following the trail of the earrings and what they mean to the receivers in various contexts.

Obviously to Madame they did not mean much in that stage of her marriage (she had plenty of other hock-able goods around her boudoir)  since she hocked them and then made up an outrageous story about losing them at the opera. Wrong move. Once the theft became public the jeweler who Madame hocked the jewels to got cold feet and sold them to the stiff upper-lipped general a second time. The General, in turn, used them as bait in his rush to get rid of an inconvenient mistress that he had tired of whom he was sending off to Turkey. She, in turn, hocked then when she got in over her head in gambling debts in some Kasbah casino. They were subsequently purchased by a Baron, played by Vittorio DeSica, who was on the way to Paris to take up a diplomatic post. Are you still with me?

This is where things got dicey. The Baron met and was enchanted by Madame who used every coquettish trick in the book to entice him, and to discard him like an old shoe. Eventually they do become lovers and as a token of that love the kindly Baron gives Madame, you guessed it, the earrings. Problem: she cant wear the things as a sign of her love for the Baron since the game would be up with the General. So the hair-brained Madame finds the missing jewels. Oops. The general already suspicious took the found jewels from Madame and confronted the Baron with the truth of Madames lies. Get this though. He wanted the Baron to sell them to the now obviously seriously wealthy jeweler so he could buy them a third time and present them yet again to Madame. Meanwhile the Baron seeing what the real picture was bowed, out of the scene. All very civilized, civilized indeed.

Done, right. Are you kidding. The irate General gave them to Madame but told her to give them to a niece who has just given birth to a child. She, the niece, in turn, sold those freaking earrings to the now over the top rich jeweler to pay off hubbys debts. The reckless if wealthy jeweler tried to sell them to the General a fourth time but he balked on this one. Madame stepped up to purchase them though after hocking some goods that she could have hocked to begin with. That purchase, that final purchase (at least in the film) was the tripping point for the General knowing that Madame was purchasing the jewels back out of devotion to the Baron. The General decided to confront the Baron with his indiscretions with Madame, with his wife. Such matters of honor were then settled in a very civilized way-divorce court. No, no on the field of honor among gentlemen-a duel. The Baron was doomed but would not back down. As a token trying to save the Baron through some miracle Madame placed the earring as a donation at her church. No go. The Baron caught the westbound train, was killed by the Generals single well-placed bullet. Madame, well, Madame, began to fall apart as usual when any slight or grand thing laid her low. A great film which you really must watch when you get a chance. And remember the moral too.",1474243200,,4887,4.503945885005637
