8251624,1,B0013KSAUI,"Let me say - this is the first time I have ever really had a problem with a seller on Amazon. The DVD was ordered early April, and still has not arrived. I tried three times to contact the seller to find out where my DVD was, but have not heard one peep from him/her.??
I filed a claim, and Amazon made good on it by refunding my purchase. Please understand - I'd rather have the DVD than the money - that is why I purchased it in the first place. If this DVD was somehow lost in transit - that is fine...but to not have a reply from the seller..and to not have him track the package (which I was not able to do) is simply poor customer service, and shows they don't care.
I will never buy from this seller again, and I caution anybody looking at anything he/she sells. Very disappointed in the lack of response!!
So - buyer beware!!!
A big thanks to Amazon!! They did right by the customer!!

8251625,5,B0013KSAUI,"OK, I'm new to djembe. Just got one; can't wait to get good at it and add that texture to our band. So, I've ordered several instructional dvd's to get me going. Of all the ones I've ordered, this was the one I needed most. I like Mattoli's enthusiasm and instructional style. And of all the videos, this was the one that was easiest to follow the instruction AND [just as importantly] to navigate.  I'm glad I got it & feel I'm finally off to a good start.",1300924800,4,457,4.193181818181818
8251626,3,B0013KSAUI,"This is not the best instruction video by this teacher. Paulo has a whole other series of great instruction videos under the name ""Hands on Drumming"" - Session 1-4. In my opinion, the material in the other series is presented in a much better fashion and is easier to understand.

I found this DVD hard to navigate. The links were difficult to spot and not labeled well. At first I thought it was mostly a perfomance DVD and gave it a poor review for it's instructional qualities. After a couple more viewings, I was able to locate the links to the instructions and did find it useful, although not nearly as easy to understand as his other instruction videos.",1300147200,,660,4.546218487394958
8251627,2,B0013KSAUI,The DVD is definitely not for those who are just starting out. It's not what I expected.,1232323200,4,88,4.235294117647059
