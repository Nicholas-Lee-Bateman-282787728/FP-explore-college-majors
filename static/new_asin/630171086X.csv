7814578,5,630171086X,My sons both watched this video so much that I thought we would have to buy the library a new copy.  Now I am looking for it to give my grandson.  It's a keeper.,1440979200,,161,3.7058823529411766
7814579,5,630171086X,"We've rented this video from the library several times and finally decided to buy it.  My 16 month old son absoultely adores it.  This is one of few children's videos I've seen with absolutely nothing annoying about it -- just simple trucks, pleasant music, no crazy antics or marketing ploys.  Highly, highly recommended!",1018051200,,322,5.037735849056604
7814580,5,630171086X,"When I found Moving Machines in our local library, I simply checked it out because my little boy (2 at the time) liked trucks and construction equipment. Ho-hum, another truck video...not so! I loved putting this one on. It contains NO irritating jingles or tunes that get stuck in your head at midnight, no irritating behavior your child might imitate, and no irritating introductions of ""also from studio blah-blah,"" or, ""coming soon to blah-blah home video"" - you parents know what I mean, you sit through 20 minutes of ads before the movie comes on.
Moving Machines is simply filmed, with an understated percussion background tailored to the action. Real trucks and machines are juxtaposed with children playing with toy versions, and the only dialogue is sparse commentary from children speaking naturally.
This video is such a welcome break from the fluffy, saccharine films out today. It does not pretend to teach a great moral lesson, nor is it aimed at hypnotizing your child into the world of brand-name demand (while your kid might want a dump truck after seeing this, you will be free to buy any dump truck you choose.)
Moving Machines also has staying power. My son still asks for it often, and it's been about two years since he first watched it. Kids adore this video, and you will too - by not noticing it's there.",1004313600,,1330,4.78695652173913
7814581,5,630171086X,"When our oldest child was one year old, we borrowed this video from our local library. He was riveted, but he didn't sit like a zombie. He was inspired to play like the kids and adults in the video.
 It portrays trucks and tractors in real-life situations interspersed with kids and their toy trucks and tractors doing the same things. Everywhere we went our son would recognize and name the trucks and tractors in the video.
 It is narrated entirely by children who explain what is going on in kid-talk and accompanied by charming music and sound effects. It is obvious that the producers know the interests and developmental needs of their audience. After checking it out 5 times we decide we needed to own it for ourselves.",986860800,,726,4.6640625
