8350044,5,B0023S49PE,"The series is one of the oldies, but goodies that is still entertaining after many years. Much better written and acted than any of the current US TV shows. We are slowly working our way through from the beginning to the end of the series. You quickly pick up the dialog and accent.",1408406400,,282,4.339622641509434

DVD = **** (no extras or subttitles/closed captions. )

This is volume 6 on the original series.  The series is at its best here!
""DEATH COMES SHORTLY"" (series 6 - December 3rd, 1990) 129 minutes - After an elderly man is found murdered, the relatives come under suspicion.
The 2+ hour format allows plenty of time for subplots & red herrings to keep you guessing. It is nice to see Jackie in her debut episode.
""ROGUES' GALLERY"" (series 6 - December 31, 1990) 79 minutes - Dead bodies are turning up in the trunks of cars in a junk yard about to be crushed.
Reduced to under an hour & a half, this story is still quite complex and full of red herrings to keep you guessing up to the end.
""VIOLENT DELIGHTS"" (series 7 - January 1, 1992) 79 minutes - A student stalking his beautiful teacher thinks he has witnessed a shocking murder.
Over a year has passed since the last Taggart episode was broadcast but the crew has not lost their edge.

The proper sequence to view these sets is:
1) KILLER set
2) DEATH CALL set
3) COLD BLOOD set
4) ROOT OF EVIL set
5) EVIL EYE set
6) VIOLENT DELIGHTS set
7) THE HIT MAN set
8) RING OF DECEIT set
9) DEATH WITHOUT DISHONOUR set
10) HELLFIRE set
11) PRAYER FOR THE DEAD set (the last Jim Taggart episode)

I saw the DCI Burke episodes first (which Jackie is also in) and was unsure how I would like the original Taggart.
Well my wife & I were extremely pleased to find that we like the original DCI Taggart version even more. Taggart has a wry sense of humor to offset the serious feel of the mystery. His team is top notch, following up clues & tailing suspects. The DCI Burke team seams a little sloppy compared to the original team, which makes Burke a bit cranky.

The audio is clear, but I would have appreciated some subtitles to help with the accents.",1307923200,,1808,4.2748538011695905
