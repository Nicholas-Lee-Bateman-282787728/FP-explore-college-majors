4667679,5,B005EVY8MQ,"Though he was an undisputed genius of the cinema, not everyone needs the complete Hitchcock features. If you're a keen fan, they're available on DVD in large, rather expensive box sets: the 15-disc Masterpiece, nine-disc Signature, and eight-disc Premiere Collections (these don't include his ""non-Hitchcockian"" silent films and talkies from the 1920s and early 30s). But many Hitchcock lovers recall the five films on this reasonably-priced five-disc set most fondly, and they are without question among his finest achievements, all of them produced in Hollywood between 1954 and 1963.

Presented with a few interesting extras and options, the DVDs will do nicely for many folks -- though not for the angry Blu-ray aficionados who've given the box single-star ratings. This may come as a shock to them, but some people who are just discovering Hitch have ordinary DVD players and 32-inch TVs and are not planning to spend thousands to upgrade their collections or their equipment. If you have a big TV and want Blu-rays, however, this and the Masterpiece boxes are both available in that format, offering excellent video and audio quality and far more supplementary material than their DVD editions.

Following is a brief review of each film in this set. All are in color except for ""Psycho,"" which is black and white.

Rear Window: Jimmy Stewart is a housebound photographer who thinks he's witnessed a neighbor (Raymond Burr) commit a murder. He enlists his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, to investigate, and they're both drawn deeper and deeper into hotter and hotter water. A master class in the art of suspense.

Vertigo: Stewart plays a detective haunted by loss, while Kim Novak portrays two women, one of whom is a doppelganger of the other. Is she a twin or a ghost? This is a mysterious, compelling tale of obsession, madness, and death, with one of the most brilliant climaxes in the history of film.

North by Northwest: Cary Grant is an innocent man on the run in this gripping spy thriller. Eva Marie Saint plays his love interest and James Mason his nemesis. The film is propelled by renowned set pieces -- a stabbing at the UN, a chase by a crop duster, and a literal cliffhanger atop Mount Rushmore.

Psycho: An embezzler played by Janet Leigh meets Anthony Perkins, a motel manager with maternal issues, in one of most influential horror movies ever made. ""Psycho"" is filled with twists that don't just shock; they chill you to the bone. You may want a hot shower after this one (or maybe not).

The Birds: Tippi Hedren follows Rod Taylor to a small town where birds suddenly start terrorizing the inhabitants. We never learn why; in fact, the randomness and lack of reason are among the most frightening things about the film. A terrific movie and a fitting conclusion to this must-see collection.",1319760000,182,2821,4.926315789473684
4667680,5,B005EVY8MQ,"These films are classics and it's about time that they have released these four movies in a single pack, i have been waiting for these to come out for a while now. Although I already have Psycho on DVD, I would thoroughly enjoy having these movies together in one package. Any body who appreciates film would understand that we are rating the product on DVD, those who have blu-ray complaints should take it out towards Universal or WB. Ragging on his for it's lack of overrated blu-ray capabilities is like beating up a man who didn't do anything wrong. It remains pointless. So please, check out these films if you haven't even seen them (yes i do know some people who actually haven't seen these movies yet), or especially if you don't own these movies yet! They are amazingly well crafted pieces of art!",1318291200,29,807,4.611111111111111
4667681,5,B005EVY8MQ,"This DVD box set is Beautiful, Great Art work! It is nice to see that this came with every movie on its own disk. Many company's are putting 2-3 movies on one disk. Also for never owning any of these movies there are many extras. I see that people are wanting it on Blue which I do not buy but I am sure it will come out eventually. I own about 12 Box sets and this is the nicest one I have bought and for 17 Dollars it was A steal.",1318118400,28,432,3.758241758241758

4667698,5,B005EVY8MQ,"Excellent collection of some of the best of Hitchcock. Any one of the five movies included in this set is well worth the price alone. Incredible bargain.  There isn't a bad movie in this set.
Vertigo...a mesmerizing film with an almost dreamlike quality to it.
Psycho... Hitchcock's brilliant take on horror.  This was probably the first movie of the slasher genre which became so prevalent in the eighties.  But to call this a slasher movie is like comparing Shakespeare's plays to a rom com.
North by Northwest...a thrilling classic
Rear Window...my personal favorite Hitchcock movie and one of my all time favorite movies.  I remember I was in high school when this movie was rereleased to theaters in the eighties.  My girlfriend at the time and I went to see it and we were spellbound by it.

4667702,5,B005EVY8MQ,"This is a solid DVD collection which highlights some of the best Hitchcock releases.  Quality is good throughout, and you will enjoy the special features.  Consider getting the Blu-Ray editions of the Masterpiece Collection if you want a lot more of what this collection promises.  Also, to be fair to yourself, pull the biography off the Internet (say Wikipedia) and read up on how amazing his career was during his lifetime.  Keep in mind all the ways he used music, staging, costuming, dialog, and set design, as well as the catchy titles to see why he is still studied and imitated today.  Some of the features which are based on popular books of the time are particularly well done.  Actors are, for the most part, at their best for Hitch.",1496534400,,744,4.684615384615385

Watch The Birds with the idea that the ""birds"" are actually a metaphor for fear of death/loneliness and losing control of one's life.  Hitchcock's films paved the way for suspense, atmosphere, and twist endings.  This is a MUST HAVE in anyone's film collection.",1440806400,,410,4.71830985915493

You could write a series of novels just containing every reason people need to see these films, and another just on how much pain staking attention to detail went into accessing the original, or earliest possible, assets. These are incredible films and they have survived the transition to the blu ray format wonderfully. This is the best way to see these films in your own home.
- Update
Also worth noting, each film contains an interesting commentary track and a couple extra features. This collection of films is in regular rotation at my house and I find not only the films but the bonus features all fascinating. I really can not stress how beautiful these movies are, especially Vertigo- the shots of late '50s downtown San Francisco are so vivid and vibrant.",1439337600,6,809,4.869565217391305

4667888,5,B005EVY8MQ,"I really wish I had blu ray, so that I could watch these classics in all their vibrant and luminous glory. I got a chance to look at some blu ray clips online and they're absolutely stunning compared to the DVD versions. Having said that, and as far as DVDs go, there's still pretty good quality picture and sound in all five films -- and for only 25$, that's quite a bargain! Still, blu ray simply takes it to a whole 'nother level!

All five films are Hitchcock at his best and brightest. As a native San Franciscan, Vertigo will always be my favorite Hitchcock picture. It's quite obvious, from the beginning of the first scene, that the real star of the movie is the city by the Bay, and Hitchcock places as much care and craft in photographing it as he did with all of his beautiful blonde starlets. It is a master class in creating perfect balances of technical filmmaking (color, sound, etc.) and plot, character and theme.",1433462400,,930,4.470588235294118

So, rather than spring for the whole set, just to finally get a dazzling VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW, this seemed to be the best bet. Had to re-buy another copy of N BY NW, which I didn't really need.  But, at it's bargain price, this can't be beat.  The three biggies mentioned above look truly dazzling. THE BIRDS looks like Universal mid-60s stuff and PSYCHO looks like black and white Paramount.

Seeing it in the glory of color that it deserves (with the exception of 'Psycho,' which looks lavishly improved for black and white on the big widescreen..

I finally purchased the Alfred Hitchcock the essential collection on blu ray. Seeing many good and bad about the set. The five classics from the previous masterpiece 15 disc collection. I have seen the blu ray twice and concluded the blu ray does have some flaws but overall it is a VERY GOOD set. Vertigo and North by Northwest are excellent transfers,sound is excellent and the picture is excellent. The Birds which is a favorite of mine does have its flaws but not much,it only appears when behind projection primitive special effects at the time was superior but does not mix well with todays technology on blu ray but Hitchcock was known to use this technique often in his movies. Some colors are off but most of the movie is crystal clear and still enjoyable once you get in the movie you won't even notice. Rear Window,picture and sound is excellent but there are some soft tone picture highlights but only a few. Psycho is crystal clear in most parts and some grainy soft tones in some passages. The five movies presented here are a few of his best. The set is a fold out booklet with each disc represented with original movie posters and the documentaries are plentifuls.

4668145,5,B005EVY8MQ,"The Movies:

It doesn't get much better than these five, at least when it comes to the suspense/thriller genre. What is particularly notable about Hitchcock is how he transcends the boundaries of just this genre, though, and creates movies that say interesting things about humanity.

Rear Window and North By Northwest are perhaps the most ""standard"" entries in that genre, which is not to say they are pedestrian in any way. They both display Hitchcock's mastery of pacing and tone, and are among the most entertaining movies ever made as a result.

Vertigo is the odd duck, in that it is much slower and more introspective, showing us one man's journey into his own fears and desires. Not that this is a bad thing - it is a mesmerizing melding of visual and story elements.

Psycho and The Birds may be the most interesting from a film appreciation perspective - they take very standard genres - the slasher and the disaster movie, and completely subvert viewer expectations of them. Psycho starts off as a typical ""average person in extraordinary situation"" plot, but then goes off the rails in its violent middle act. The Birds starts as a romantic comedy and then introduces the chaos of nature.

In summary: they are each classics, and if a director had been responsible for just one of them, he or she would be celebrated. Hitchcock was responsible for all five. I envy the budding film buff who gets to watch these for the first time, basking in the glow of legitimate genius.

The Blu-Ray:

The video transfers on display here are varied. Vertigo and North By Northwest look by far the best, which is probably predictable given that they were filmed in VistaVision, a format noted for its detail and color fidelity. They show vibrant color, strong detail, good contrast levels, and little or no visible post-production tinkering. Psycho looks good but its middle third is rather soft. Rear Window looks nice, but was pretty clearly subjected to some computer tricks in restoration, which lends a bit of a digital veneer to things. The Birds is somewhat problematic, veering wildly between beautiful HD imagery, strange digital monkeying, and visual problems that are the result of the plethora of period optical process shots used to create the effects. All in all, the set as a whole is not bad. You get 2 beauties, 2 average looking Blu-Rays, and 1 dud.

The audio is excellent, with DTS-MA soundtracks that range from 5.1 to 2.0 channel mixes (North by NW has a Dolby TrueHD mix). The dialogue is crystal clear, there is no hiss or crackle, and the music, especially the Bernard Hermann soundtracks on Vertigo, N by NW and Psycho, is totally immersive (the title sequence to Vertigo blew me away - turn it up!).

Extras include commentaries by experts (some involved in production) for 4 of the 5 movies (The Birds excepted). Each disc contains copious making-of features, many running over an hour in length. Unfortunately, all are in SD, and have been repurposed from previous DVD releases. Oh, well. They are still quite informative and are a great option for those who will want to dive deeper into the movies. There is a commendable lack of EPK fluff pieces that plague many modern discs (e.g. stars in front of a poster, talking about how happy they were to work on Project X with Director Y).

The packaging is pretty mediocre. The art looks nice, but the slipcase is thin paperboard and picks up dings quite easily. The interior is a folding (ugh) plastic tray (ugh) affair that really fails to impress. This is not the sturdy cardboard of, say, the Indiana Jones or Alien Anthology sets. Nor is it the durable blue plastic casing on many 5 disc sets (such as Star Trek TNG or Blade Runner). It feels cheap, and it is cheap. I guess this is what we get when we buy the smaller set and not the 15-disc mega set for much more money.

Conclusion:

Packaging aside and variable video quality aside, I basically don't think it is possible to beat the five discs here for average quality of content. 4 of these 5 movies are in AFI's Top 100 list regardless of genre, and *all* of them are in the Top 20 of AFI's Thriller list. It's the cream of the cream, there are no duds as in many collections. At its current price it is absolute highway robbery. Anybody who likes Hitchcock, suspense/thriller, or classic movies would be a fool to pass this up.",1387238400,4,4364,4.690196078431373
4668146,5,B005EVY8MQ,"Before Blu-ray, the very best home video version of Vertigo was the anamorphic DVD that Universal sold only as one of the 14 Hitchcock titles in the Masterpiece Collection. (I believe this collection also had the only anamorphic DVD version of Psycho.) It appears that Universal has released its Blu-ray version of Vertigo only as part of two collections: The Masterpiece and The Essentials collections.

I am glad that Universal has made Vertigo available in its far less expensive Essentials Blu-ray collection. In my opinion, Vertigo is not the greatest film ever made, but it is of special interest to me because of its San Francisco locations and overall Bay Area setting. Vertigo, along with Shadow of a Doubt and The Birds may also be of interest to Northern California natives. Anyway, here are my quality ratings of the 5 films contained in the Essentials Collection in order of their appeal:

1. North By Northwest: I have seen nearly every Hitchcock film and this one is my all time favorite. It features outstanding video quality in nearly every scene. The contrast is almost perfect, the picture detail is remarkably-clear and the color is about as good as it gets on Blu-ray. The North By Northwest disk in this collection is exactly the same as the Blu-ray disk from the Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary Edition, with two exceptions: The artwork on the disk is different and the option for selecting a music-only soundtrack is not available on the disk included in the Universal Essentials Collection. If you can do without Warner's 44-page book and the music-only soundtrack, the Universal Essentials Collection is the way to go for this title.

2. Vertigo: This film has very good to excellent color and picture detail. The Blu-ray version is a giant leap ahead of the anamorphic DVD and the sound is greatly improved. In view of the challenges encountered during the restoration of this classic, the quality of this latest Vertigo release is nothing short of amazing. As a result, Kim Novak's entrance in Vertigo is absolutely breathtaking. While it remains one of my favorite movies, Vertigo still has two insurmountable obstacles for me. First, I have trouble believing that shop girl Judy Barton could transform herself into a sophisticated Madeleine Elster. Second, I have no trouble believing that 50 year old 'Scottie' Ferguson could fall for 25 year old Madeleine/Judy, but I don't see how she could have fallen for him.

3. Rear Window: The elaborately-detailed set featured in this film requires fine detail and accurate color. This disk delivers on both counts. There are some variations in picture quality when scenes change, but the overall film presentation is very well done.

4. Psycho: The look of this black and white film is clear and well-detailed, with good contrast and enough film grain to avoid that pasty look so common in other black and white films transferred to Blu-ray.

5. The Birds: The dated special effects didn't transfer well to this high-definition format. Some scenes are very good, but others are not so good. This film is not one of my favorites, so I am not too concerned that it doesn't look all that great overall. Still, the film is highly-watchable and the great improvement over its DVD predecessor is a welcome change. If this is one of your favorite Hitchcock films, you will be able to overlook the flaws.

After reading the one-star reviews from 2011, I finally noticed that Amazon has mixed the Blu-ray and DVD reviews together. If I hadn't noticed this important fact, I would have been under the impression that these five Hitchcock Blu-ray disks from the Essentials Collection were made from out of date, vastly-inferior recycled masters. Then I discovered that Vertigo was first released on Blu-ray in October 2012. I already owned North By Northwest, which was released by Warner Bros. in 2009 and this disk is one of the finest Blu-ray releases that I have ever seen. So, when reading the reviews, keep in mind that many of them are for the DVD collection.",1386460800,137,4027,4.9219440353460975

4668156,5,B005EVY8MQ,"I have just received this item.  I already had owned all of these movies, all but one in the ""Masterpiece"" DVD collection, also offered by Universal.  My reason to purchase the present set was to own ""Vertigo"" in the High Definition  Blu Ray format.  It is one of my favorite movies, and recently named the best of all time by the British Film Institute.  Filmed in VistaVision,  the large frame format would seem to provide an excellent substrate for high resolution images.  Within a few minutes, it was obvious how wonderful this new Blu Ray transfer is, compared to the already excellent DVD version.  The mosquito noise, seen on the DVD, has vanished, revealing absolutely crystal-clear images-  one can read the license plates on most of the cars, and even the small newsprint Scotty is perusing, while eavesdropping on Kim Novak, as she leaves her  apartment.  As importantly, color fidelity, and particularly color saturation, is awesome.  Certainly, we have to thank Mr. Robet Harris for his miraculous restoration of the negative, which was in such poor condition that it was almost beyond recovery.  I know other very alert reviewers have found flaws in the transfer, particularly at the end of the film.  But, even allowing these imperfections, the overall improvement in picture quality derived from the Blu Ray transfer is more than worth the purchase price.

My only concern is what may be some very brief dropouts of the audio- I don't know if this is a disk problem or a malfunction of my player.  Otherwise, the audio quality is excellent, with a remarkably fine stereophonic reproduction of Bernard Hermann's magical score, which makes an absolutely critical contribution to this extraordinary motion picture.

I really look forward to seeing other disks,  including ""The Birds,""  ""North by Northwest, ""Psycho,"" and ""Rear Window,""  but even if all of them are unplayable, I'm still glad I purchased the new version of ""Vertigo""- for those who love this movie, as the title of this set says,  it's an ""essential"" addition to one's personal library!",1383523200,52,2066,5.017647058823529

4668161,5,B005EVY8MQ,"I believe the Alfred Hitchcock: The Essentials Collection is just that. These five films are essential films directed by Alfred Hitchcock. NORTH BY NORTHWEST, REAR WINDOW, PSYCHO, VERTIGO and THE BIRDS can certainly all be called Alfred Hitchcock essentials.

THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human heart as befuddled humans' fears are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony. Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions.

1954's REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.

Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out in this film and has become legendary in many ways as so many of the images are in the film. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene. Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film.

Sir Alfred Hitchcock was trying to make a statement that we as moviegoers are voyeurs and are just as fanatically obsessed by the images on the screen as ""Scottie"" Ferguson is with Madeleine in VERTIGO. VERTIGO is in effect a movie about people who love the cinema and are captivated by it. Those people who do not like VERTIGO state that it is not realistic and too improbable. That is just the point. VERTIGO is about an artificial world and the fascination of that world. Those who like VERTIGO are drawn to it over and over because it is about something that is inside each of us that is ever so fleeting and will always remain unobtainable. Bernard Herrmann, the film's composer seems to have understood the essence of this film as he captured the erotic passion and ultimate hopelessness of its characters with his haunting score. Herrmann had always expressed his desire to be a symphony conductor, yet the lure of the cinema was more than just a means of collecting a paycheck for him. I think he had a great understanding of the cinema and its power over human emotions, yet it seems to have remained an enigma even for him.

1960'S PSYCHO is probably one of Hitchcock's best known film. Its images and sounds are indelibly etched into the psyche of our culture. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the Bates Motel, Bernard Herrmann's score, Saul Bass' main title designs, the shower scene and many other elements are cinematic icons. One element of this film that has not been given due recognition is Martin Balsam's performance as Milton Arbogast the private investigator. Balsam embodied the personification of professionalism and determination yet he was cut off in mid stream. I think there is a statement being made about the very nature of justice and fate and that life is not always fair. I would call these five films essential Hitchcock.",1381104000,6,4145,4.9411764705882355

4668167,5,B005EVY8MQ,"REAR WINDOW (1954): Rear Window sounds so simple it shouldn't have worked. A film that takes place in a single room, in which an invalided reporter spies on his neighbours with binoculars? Only Alfred Hitchcock - the master of mood, suspense, and terror, and James Stewart - Hitchcock's favourite everyman actor could make it work. And boy do they ever. If you haven't seen it, do so immediately, and if you have, it's time to see it again. The dialogue is as sharp and witty as ever, James Stewart is still brilliant, and Grace Kelly is still Hitchcock's best Blonde. The screenplay is unbelievably tense and suspenseful; you will be wringing your hands in disbelief. This was not the first Hitchcock film I have seen, but it was the first to cement my opinion that Alfred Hitchcock was the greatest director of all time. And Rear Window? His most entertaining film. 9/10

VERTIGO (1958): If Rear Window was his most entertaining film, Vertigo was the film in which Hitchcock faced his deepest thoughts and fears. Obsession, mistaken identity, paranoia...these were Hitchcock's favourite topics, and Vertigo is the Master of Suspense at his most thoughtful, most brilliant, most mournful, most tragic, most haunting. Literally everything about this film is completely, utterly perfect. From the camera work, to Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score, to Stewart's crazed performance, to Kim Novak's icy blondeness, to the unforgettable climax...I would venture to call Vertigo Hitchcock's magnum opus. 10/10

NORTH BY NORTHWEST: Taking a break from all these deep movies, Hitchcock makes North by Northwest. The first Hitch film I ever saw, Northwest sees Cary Grant on the run from a mysterious organization, aided by Eva Marie Saint in a career making role. James Mason steals the scenes as the dapper villain out to get Thornton with all the doggedness of Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive. While much of this film has been copied and parodied endless times over (huge influence on early Bond films), when you watch North by Northwest (and then watch Psycho) you cannot help but feel that Hitchcock is just warming up for the next film to come. Extremely action-packed and entertaining, even very blackly funny, but not timeless, and not perfect. 7.5/10

PSYCHO: If Vertigo was the film where Hitchcock confronted his own deepest fears, Psycho was the one where he took our most primal fears and put them onscreen. Do not underestimate Psycho. It is damn scary. Like, grip-the-edge-of-your-seat, hold-your-breath-scary. It took me weeks to man-up and watch Psycho, and when I did I was not disappointed. Hitchcock has his finger on the pulse of the mood, and the film is scariest when you see nothing at all. The acting is absolutely phenomenal, with Perkins turning in one of the all-time greatest performances in cinematic history as the troubled hotel owner Norman Bates. This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen, and it might just be Hitchcock's masterpiece of audience manipulation. Utter, utter genius. 10/10

The text color of the menu choices are a light blue - when you select the desired menu choice, they change to a very slightly different light purple color.  Very slightly different.

Warner owns Tcm but never released the full image version, cutting it on 3 sides!

4668209,3,B005EVY8MQ,"If you don't have these movies. Buy this set. These are ALL five star productions and the extras are pretty cool. So, how can Hitchcock get 3 stars. Well, he didn't.
The ""collection"" packaging does.
This simple boxed set is pretty sad for some of the best movies ever made being released together.
First the 'outer box' that the collection sets in is simple cardboard with an old 'letter' flap on the back. Once you've removed the inner box once or twice (well maybe a third), that internal flap will begin to fold and wear. You'll have to tape it down to keep it out of the way. The inner box design makes keeping the outer box necessary.
Second the inner box is not in a book format but a flip out, like unfolding a map. Each movie has a specific place to set made obvious by the artwork behind where the DVD's set. But since there is an uneven number of movies, there is an uneven number of folds and it looks wrong when closed. I also suggest before trying to get to Psycho or The Birds you set the whole thing down on a table. It can be done but that triple flap foldout is awkward.
Third the added 'poster cards' included, although wonderful in themselves are a problem. They are double sided art which means more for us. But if you remove them from the packaging (which you must do to see them all), you now have no place to keep them. There is no 'designed slot' as part of the package where you can slide them and hold them in place. I promise you'll have to handle them every time you watch any of these movies whether you try to slide them between the inner and outer boxes or if you put them inside the inner box, they are going to slide out. This may seem no big deal, but if you consider it, they could easily have made the inner box even (6 spots, double flip out left and right), they would have had an extra 'backing' where a slot could have been made to hold these cards and at the same time made the inner box look better.
Now I realize that this ""collectors edition"" is priced as low as it is BECAUSE of the packaging. BECAUSE they didn't put a lot of bells and whistles into the wrapping. The price and the movies are the REASON why YOU have no REASON not to purchase. Some of the extras on the DVD's I have not seen before and I've enjoyed finding out more about these movies that I love. I love the fact that I own them and can brag about it.

4668225,4,B005EVY8MQ,"I bought this because I wanted to own a copy of Vertigo and I figured I might as well get some other classics. They're all good but they are so similar in their aesthetic that they feel like the same movie. The drama starts to seem silly in movies that otherwise seem serious (compared to contemporary films). It's great how much time is spent inside a general store making a phone call in ""The Birds,"" as it affords a kind of mundane credibility to the world of the film, but the same perspective can't be maintained when it's a bunch of birds terrorizing the town and nobody can do anything about it. Silly threats are fine for movies - over the top threats are everywhere - but they don't mix well with long contemplative shots of everyday reality.

I like Vertigo because it plays a psychological line the whole way through. Others, like North by Northwest and The Birds, don't pull me in as well.",1358985600,,901,4.460606060606061

The inference that the attacks could somehow be linked to a rich socialite is craftily woven into this tale. Psycho is one of Hitchcock's most famous films. If you've never seen this movie, you'll think twice about staying in a motel so far off the beaten path. North By Northwest is a breathtaking story of espionage that moves like a travelogue across the USA. Rear Window is the quintessential Hitchcock building a story out of nothing - or is it nothing. The glamorous Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter play excellent sleuths for a wheelchair bound James Stewart. And finally, Vertigo.

The Blue-ray ""To Catch a Thief"" is a wonder to the eyes, and I will throw it in for number six, just for the heck of it. However, I will add that ""North by Northwest"" is the best-paced and most entertaining of Hitch's movies.

Vertigo, North By Northwest, and Rear Window are fresh today as they were back in the 50's.

The extras in this package are not as thorough as some but we were not interested in much more than a good copy of the films and you get that here and at a much lower price than the ones with all the bells and whistles.,1331251200,6,496,3.97

4668248,5,B005EVY8MQ,"This is the ideal hitchcock collection for the average viewer like myself. Phyco, rear window, vertigo, north by northwest, and the birds. Hitchcocks best films in one set. Perfect! The packedgeing is also very good. Love this set and the price is a steal. Don't listen to the haters. They don't understand the point of this set. This set is for an average viewer who wants Hitchcocks most popular movies for a good price. This is not made to be a hudge set for a hardcore fan that cost $50-$100. The set is perfect the whey it is. 5 stars. :)",1327795200,7,543,4.3861386138613865

4668251,5,B005EVY8MQ,"This is an excellent set. While these five movies may or may not be my five favorite Hitchcock films (I would love to have seen Strangers on a Train and/or Shadow of a Doubt included), they are definitely up there, and are certainly his five most famous films. I've been having a great time watching these with my roommates, who seem pretty impressed by Hitchcock too. The transfers look as good as the individually packaged DVDs, which is to say, very nice. The packaging looks and feels very solid and attractive. As an unexpected bonus, there are miniature, card-stock, mock-ups of the original theatrical posters.",1320019200,3,617,4.885714285714286
