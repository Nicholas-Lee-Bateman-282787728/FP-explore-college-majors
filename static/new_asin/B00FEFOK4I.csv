5979513,5,B00FEFOK4I,"Great movie.  Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

Great Movie !!",1489190400,2,385,4.686567164179104
5979514,5,B00FEFOK4I,Vivacious Lady is such a good movie.  I love the old classic movies and this one does not disappoint.,1485475200,,101,4.315789473684211
5979515,5,B00FEFOK4I,"Contrary to previous statements, WB did a very fine job with the transfer of this to DVD. It's gorgeous quality for a gorgeous film. Vivacious Lady is perhaps one of the best and most underrated Jimmy Stewart films ever. I have seen this movie several times and every time it makes me laugh even harder. With the cast alone, it is worth checking it out. Ginger Rogers is the epitome of grace and charm in this film, and Jimmy plays the love struck botany professor, who has to tell his parents he married a showgirl after only knowing her for one day.  His mother is played by Beulah Bondy, one of many times where she played his mother. A young Hattie McDaniel even has a brief moment in the film, quite a few years before she would win the Oscar for Gone with the Wind.
I recommend this to everyone.",1485302400,,801,4.34

5979528,5,B00FEFOK4I,"One of the funniest romantic comedies of all time!  Too bad that until now it's been so difficult to find on DVD.

Ginger Rogers and Jimmy Stewart reportedly had an off-screen relationship while filming this movie.  Stewart plays a conservative college professor, son of an even stodgier University president when he crosses paths with Ginger Rogers, a high profile, free-spirited nightclub performer.  They fall in love right off the bat (this happens in the first 5 mins, so not too much of a spoiler here), and they spend the rest of the movie trying to let his stodgy, overbearing father and delicate mother know that they are married.

Watch for one of the very best girl fight scenes in movie history as Rogers (Stewart's wife) and Francis Mercer (Stewart's fiance) duke it out.

If you enjoy films like ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""You've Got Mail"", and ""While You Were Sleeping"", you'll eat this up.

All in all, I rate this film up there with other classic B/W romantic comedies that somehow got more airtime than this one.  There is one downside, and that is the blond and female stereotyping common in the 1930s.  Get past that and you've got yourself a great film to enjoy.

5 solid stars.",1428192000,6,1197,4.739130434782608

Jimmy and Ginger are actually already married at this point, but are hiding that fact.  I love Charles Coburn films.  He's not as fun here as in some films, but I just always enjoy having him in a film.  Jimmy Stewarts plays his son, and Stewart does a good drunk scene... rebelling against his dad.  This is a frothy comedy so just sit back and relax and smile.  :0)",1415577600,,521,4.309278350515464

5979551,5,B00FEFOK4I,"This is a cleverly done romantic comedy with Ginger Rogers and Jimmy Stewart in one of his earlier starring roles.  Ginger Rogers is a nightclub singer/dancer who falls in love instantly with the serious Botany Professor, as portrayed by Jimmy Stewart.  The Botany Professor was just there to find his rapscallion cousin, but falls madly in-love with the nightclub singer and decides to marry her right away.  There is just one problem when they go to meet his College Professor parents, he's engaged to someone else.  And his College President Dad is horrified by the thought of the ultra-attractive blonde being his son's wife.  After all, how can a nightclub singer be the wife of the future president of the college?  Naturally, all turns out well but we are treated to some wonderful laughs in the process.  Surprisingly, given the movie is from the 1930s, the professor does talk back rather strongly and disrespectfully to his Dad.  However, overall the movie is a nice light-hearted feature.  It does have lots of smoking and some alcohol, so I can't say it is truly suited for family viewing.  However, it is quite clean overall.  Another detail of the movie is that it includes a cameo appearance by Hattie McDaniel as the maid.  And even though her part is not a long one on screen, just her few seconds in the film are electrifying and give a hint of her future Oscar Winning role the next year.",1412380800,9,1407,4.721311475409836

8614783,5,B00FEFOK4I,"Of course, I love this film. It has all the elements of a great classic comedy, including a sweet romance between a night club singer and a college professor, an odd-couple pairing of in-laws, several amusing secondary characters, such as the typical spoiled-rotten and terribly mismatched prior love interest and the best friend/romantic rival, and, as always, two of Hollywood's greatest old-timey stars, the ones I love most, in this case, Jimmy Stewart and Ginger Rogers. If that sounds good to you, you'll enjoy this. But, as usual, I wanted to write this to let you know about the releases of this film or, more accurately put, the lack of releases.

Vivacious Lady is, for no reason I can fathom, one of the less popular Jimmy Stewart romantic comedies of the 1930s. It was finally released on DVD, for the first time, in 2013, by Warner under the Warner Archive Label. It had been restored, to a point, for HD broadcast on networks like my beloved Turner Classic Movies and, owing to that restoration, could have easily been put on Blu-ray. However, there was no market for a full remastering and Blu-ray release, which would have cost more for the company than they were likely to make back in sales. And so, Warner decided to release this as one of their MOD (DVD-R) releases, most likely at a loss, for fans like me, and I really appreciate that they did this even though I do wish there was more of a market for this film.

As to the quality of the release, it is actually pretty good, just as it is, even though it is not in high definition. To clarify, the picture is not perfect but looks far better than it would have, had they not done any work on it for the television master. The picture is clear enough, for a DVD, and the image is cleaner than had previously been available. The sound is very good, especially considering the age of this film, and the texture and grain of the film is preserved well enough to keep that cinematic quality, again, even though it is in low definition. The release preserves the original theatrical ratio of 1:37:1 and, of course, this is in Black and White.

As of now, in 2018, there is no digital version, SD or HD, for this film and no Blu-ray anywhere in the world. This is likely the best we will see of this film, unless it is, at some point, made available for digital purchase but, keep in mind, when Warner puts their MOD Archive titles out on digital, some of them are in HD and some are only available in SD, predictably in line with what the DVD picture would suggest people would want to see. This one strikes me as an SD only release, not quite clean enough for an HD version, unless they did a little more restorative work, and if it is released in digital format as SD-only, it will be identical to this release, using the same transfer. So, if you are interested in this film, my recommendation is that you go ahead and get this version. It just isn't likely to be released as a Blu-ray or in Digital HD anytime soon and it is well worth the viewing.

Good luck finding a film to perk up your day. This one brings joy every time I see it.",1524873600,3,3107,4.4171029668411865
