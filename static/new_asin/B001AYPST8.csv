Snuff: A Documentary About Killing On Camera (2015)

Special Anniversary Edition

Wild Eye Releasing

Director: Paul Von Stoetzel

Rating: 4/5

Initially released in 2008, this out of print film, Snuff: A Documentary About Killing on Camera, is not your typical documentary film. Upon its original release, Snuff was hit hard with many criticisms. Most of the criticism was focused on the level of brutality that this film shows. Documentary films surrounding this particular subject matter never go to the extremes of where director Paul Von Stoetzel takes us. Even for a seasoned veteran horror film junkie, Snuff pushes its welcome.

Snuff is well shot and well executed. Von Stoetzel has put together a documentary that is both beautiful and appalling that will burn into your brain for weeks. Had Snuff not gone so far to show us snuff and real violence, I may have rated it higher. But then again, it may not have had the lasting effect that it gives.

Without spoiling too much, Snuff shows graphic depiction of real life killing and challenges you to decide what snuff really is. Is it the movie that looks all too real? The war footage on television? Nightly news? Faces of Death? Snuff never answers these questions and it never pretends to. Ultimately it is your decision.

I am still on the fence as to whether or not I can recommend this film. I didn't enjoy it. Thats not to say it is not a competent and engaging documentary, it definitely is. The subject matter and footage used are extreme, even gore-hounds. However, I will recommend that if you do watch, watch the whole thing. Youll be tempted at times to shut it off. Do not. If you start it, you need to finish it. You need to see where the commentary takes you in order to get the full impact of the film. I also recommend that you watch Paul Von Stoetzel s interview with Dave Schrader. The interview provides answers to some of the questions or outrage you may have upon completing the film.",1432512000,7,1994,4.723342939481268

8280222,4,B001AYPST8,Snuff films are a taboo subject to be sure. They just seem wrong on every level which is probably why you don't hear them discussed much. They are the real dark side of humanity that makes people really uncomfortable. I give the producers their props for venturing into this dark subject.,1374710400,,288,4.666666666666667
8280223,1,B001AYPST8,"A rather sloppily slapped together documentary about the possible existance of real snuff films, explores the myths as well as the reality. There are some extremely disdurbing moments within some of the footage. Most of it is from films that have already been dismissed as fake but were once thought to be real because some people thought they might be real snuff movies, such as Itallian director Deodatos very graphic and realistic film Cannibal Holcaust. But the most disturbing moments involve real video shot of actual death such as the beheading of an american soldier by Iraqi terrorists. That is indeed pretty horrific even though this documenjtary cuts away just as the beheading begins. Also the footage serial killer Charles Ing and his partner shot of their captives before they abused then murdered them is very terrible to see. By the grace of God we are not subjected to having to see the actual deaths of any of their victims, but it is still pretty horrifying none the less. Though this documentary has some very disturbing moments it is still tame compared to another far more disturbing film I recently saw about real death called Death Scenes, which is so disturbing it makes Faces of Death feel like Peter Pan. None the less this film did manage to get under my skin even if it was rather poory produced.",1367625600,,1325,4.790393013100437

8280225,1,B001AYPST8,"Man, what a piece of junk this documentary was. Being someone who has somewhat of a slight interest in the idea of the existence of snuff films, I watched this expecting something that would maybe talk about the legend, where the legend came from, what the idea of snuff films say about our society, the numerous instances in which the urban legend came close to being a reality, and perhaps an investigation on these so-called pieces of evidence. Instead, what I got was one of the most numbskulled documentaries I've seen in a while. I'm not sure whose idea it was to put out this cheap piece of sensationalism, but on the plus side at least this isn't as bad as Buried in the Sand.

The documentary starts off alright. The first big question is asked. ""What is a snuff film?"" the definition of which, people to this day have a difficult time understanding. A snuff film is a picture in which a person is killed for the film as a means of profit or commercial distribution. Before I get into what this film does wrong, I want to say that I do believe that snuff films exist. I don't think that they exist in the mainstream, and I think the idea of their possible availability in the world of underground pornographic films (like in the Joel Schumacher film 8mm) is very limited. I think that the Paul Schrader picture Hardcore features a much more realistic possibility of how a snuff film can exist. As cheesy as it sounds, I do think that somewhere in some small little screening room in some shady apartment building, a rich person is paying a high amount of money to have a snuff film screened, personally, to them. The reason why I think this is happening is simple. If pornographic pictures depicting bestiality, pedophilia, simulated rape and torture, and pretend murder and necrophilia can exist in this world, why can't a film depicting actual murder for the sole purpose of the picture somehow have slipped under the radar? The only natural conclusion I can come to is that it has, and while I don't have the guts to actually spend a good six to eight hour block of time searching online for a link to one, I do think that if I did and I were smart about it and I looked in the right places I would find one, or at least something that might resemble one.

What I was hoping for this documentary to do was to explore that aspect of the legend. Instead it proceeds to do the exact opposite. It talks a lot about gory, violent films and shows scenes from aforementioned films, it talks about serial killers and shows selected sections of their home movies, it talks about conflicts overseas and shows footage of the al-Qaeda executions, the Abu Ghraib tortures, firefights, soldiers getting sniped from afar, and then it briefly touches on possible instances that suggests the existence of snuff pictures through storytelling. I don't know where to begin with my problems with the film.

I guess I should first mention the fact that the first large scale film clip they show is a scene from the cheap piece of low budget trash titled Snuff, which is basically a South American retelling of the story of the Manson family up until the end of the picture in which the actors walk away and the script girl is videotaped being murdered by the director. This film is infamous, and I do mean infamous, for being one of the biggest examples of how a film can survive on publicity alone. The film was picketed by family groups who wanted the film to be destroyed due to it allegedly being a real snuff film. The picture made money as a result and the rest is history. It was discovered that the producer actually hired a lot of these people and wrote the articles in newspapers discrediting the film as an immoral piece of junk. This film not only manages to skimp over a lot of this information, but also plays the infamous scene from the picture telling the audience to ""judge for themselves"". What the hell does that even mean? The scene is clearly not real. The effects are laughable, even by Herschell Gordon Lewis standards, and everyone knows that the clip is fake. Lets move on! Please!

Then, the documentary talks about Cannibal Holocaust, one of the greatest horror films ever made in my opinion. To me, this film is a milestone in horror cinema. It's a deeply shocking, horrific, and bizarre film filled from start to finish with intensity, suspense, and gore. The film is almost literally an orgy of violence, almost rivaling The Passion of the Christ in explicit violence. This documentary doesn't go too into detail about the film, but instead mostly talks about it's controversial nature. Yes, the film is controversial. Yes the director Ruggero Deodato was accused of actually killing his actors and was put in jail for it until the actors came forward. However, why not talk about the film itself? There's a lot to talk about with this film. The film is a horror film first and foremost, but it also explores a lot of things like sensationalism, the media, conflicts overseas, trauma, how far one must go to find the truth, and the philosophy of entertainment in documentary film making. No, instead the interviewees talk about how controversial the film is and then move on. The filmmakers had a golden opportunity to talk about something really interesting and they blew it, but not before doing two additional things wrong.

They forget to do a lot of things in this film's ""exploration"" of Cannibal Holocaust, but one thing they don't forget to do is to show us the live animal slaughter of a Coati featured in the film. There is no reason for this clip to be in this film except to briefly talk about how future serial killers kill animals, and how wrongheaded was it to actually feature that clip in a section about serial killers? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it's not something that I necessarily want to see, but don't worry. This soon proves to a continuing habit this film has. Personally, I think that the inclusion of that clip in this film is more exploitative than anything in the films that these people talk about, but whatever. And of course, the other mistake this documentary makes is including footage of 'The Long Last Road to Hell' segment featured in Cannibal Holocaust. It's not it's inclusion in the picture that bothers me, it's more the fact that the filmmakers here didn't do their research. They include it in the documentary thinking that it's faked footage. I regret to inform them that the footage they showed was, unfortunately, real.

Throughout the next fifteen or so minutes of the documentary, they show various clips from films like Faces of Death, Emmanuel in America, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, Trouble Every Day, and Bowling for Columbine. Sometimes the interviewees have some very interesting, insightful things to say about these films, but most of the time they say things that have already been said a million times. The most interesting part is probably when they talk about Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, although once again they miss a golden opportunity to actually explore what the film was saying, which is a shame because I would have loved to hear what these people have to say about it. They talk about the most infamous scene in the film in which Henry and Otis film their slaughter of an entire family and then bring it home and watch it and then start to rewind it so that they can watch it again.

The thoughts of these people when it comes to Faces of Death is particularly strange. A lot of them act like this film did something groundbreaking and significant by showing real death on screen for the viewer, but they're dead wrong. These kinds of films have existed for a long time now. Nobody ever mentions Mondo Cane here, though they do mention the book Killing For Culture, which is something I would recommend HIGHLY over watching this film. Even Cannibal Holocaust did it before Faces of Death did it, so why even bring it up? Faces of Death is simply one of the more shocking (and popular) in a growing series of death films. Of course this film gets a lot of facts wrong throughout, although I was personally more offended by this documentary's self-righteous high and mighty attitude throughout. The interviewees, throughout much of this film, look at the audience with disgust and disdain. They even accuse Michael Moore of ""playing the snuff card"" and then proceeding to call Bowling for Columbine a snuff film (which it is far from) and then criticizing Michael Moore for showing the video footage of the Columbine massacre. My favorite part is when they say that ""Michael Moore could have easily made his point without showing that footage"" while they are proceeding to show footage of the Columbine massacre. To me, it's fairly clear that Michael Moore's reasons for showing the footage are infinitely more relevant and sensible than these filmmakers' reasons.

Then the film totally decides to go for shock value by showing us the home movie footage of Charles Ng and Leonard Lake scattered throughout an exploration of their crimes. One thing these filmmakers fail to tell us, however, is that they never actually recorded their murders. They only recorded their victims and their tormenting of them. So basically, the existence of all this footage in this film is thus muted. I don't really particularly want to see this footage and I doubt very much that the families of these victims would appreciate this footage being reproduced and put in this exploitative and sensationalistic documentary, but hey it's not like this film is offering to educate anyway. By this point, the film has gone far off track as to what snuff films even are. None of this stuff really relates all that much to the original subject. It decides to go even further off track by then talking about the conflicts overseas and then showing us what amounts to a montage of death featuring soldiers getting executed on screen. All of it is very graphic, all of it is very disgusting, and above all none of it really has any relevance to this film's subject. I covered my eyes throughout a lot of it because I simply cannot watch stuff like that. It makes my physically sick. I can't tell you how regretful I am for ever watching anything like that, and these filmmakers simply don't have any feelings for their audience. There's not a whole lot one can learn from watching real death footage other than that death is ugly. The filmmakers don't even attempt to try and connect these ideas to the idea of snuff films. They don't even have the dignity to let the clips speak for themselves, instead offering soundbites from the interviewees talking about the horror and inhumanity of it all. Why are we watching this again?

As mentioned above, the film briefly also touches on two possible instances involving snuff films. Both stories are told by Mark L. Rosen who says throughout the picture that he represents Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, though his connection with the film is something I am somewhat unclear on. His first story details the crazy adventures of Dmitri Vladimirovich Kuznetsov, who you might remember was the guy who, according to an article in 'The Guardian' got busted in a child snuff porn ring. The videos apparently detailed child pornography and horrible child sexual abuse that eventually led to death, after which the bodies, in one recorded instance allegedly titled 'necros pedo' would sometimes undergo further violation. I have read the article in 'The Guardian' about the violent pornography, I've looked the guy up, I know he exists. However, the only legitimate article I can find on the case is that very article. There's not a whole lot I can find, even about his jail sentence in which he ended up getting out due to overcrowding. The film relates to us the transcripts of the sting operation, all of which is readily available online to read, and shows us two pictures, one of which is apparently him holding an award for a pool tournament, the other showing the producer of such films holding a dead child. Here's the thing. I don't doubt that there are people like this out there. This world has billions of people in it. There is bound to be at least one sicko who is capable of such madness. However, where do we get by talking about it? Why not actually investigate? There's nothing to be gained from actually talking about things we all know. I recall back in high school, years ago, I was at a friend's house and we were looking for weird videos to watch and we came across a film titled 'necros pedo', which, obviously, we didn't open because everyone on the internet knows to not open files with titles like that. I'm pretty sure, if I wanted to, I could find the clip file again However, that story right there is more proof of the possible existence of snuff films than these filmmakers and interviewees ever muster up.

The second story, however, is more intimate. Mark Rosen talks about an instance in which a group of shady businessmen from the Philippians come to him with a video that they are looking to distribute. He watched it in a dark room. The video, allegedly, featured a woman engaging in S&M play before being brutally murdered on camera. He freaked out and left. Now here's the thing. I don't doubt the sincerity of Mark Rosen's story. I believe him completely. The story was obviously very emotional for him to talk about and I'm glad he did. However, this story doesn't get us any closer to the existence of snuff films. All we have as evidence of the existence of snuff films are anecdotes and stories. That's all anyone has for a lot of urban legends. I give the film credit because Mark Rosen did a good job telling his story. He's a wonderful storyteller and if the story is true he did a terrific job recounting it. However, so what? Films like this don't prove anything. If anything, this film clouds what the real issue is. I don't hate this film because it's bad (even though it is). I hate this film because it is pandering, it is exploitative, it is self-righteous, it is meandering, and above all it is just cheap. If you want to see a good documentary on the subject of snuff films, watch the UK documentary The Dark Side of Porn: Does Snuff Exist? It does a much better job of being straight-forward about it's subject matter and it does it all in the span of an hour.",1328227200,7,14357,4.6644295302013425
8280226,1,B001AYPST8,"A ""snuff film"" is a film where an actor WILLINGLY dies during a scene in a film (as seen in the Nicolas Cage film 8MM).  The definition has been around for decades and the producers try to re-define it by ""interviewing"" some unknown filmmakers, film ""historians"", and one jerk that is so annoying you wish he would become a subject of what they are talking about.  No one you know and they have nothing interesting to say.

ZERO research went into making this.  Although they show a few scenes from ""the devil's experiment"" from the GUINEA PIG series there is no mention of the huge controversy and investigation by the FBI (probably because it was found to be fake and that snuff films don't exist).  If you're going to make a documentary at least present some information and not just lame talking heads.  Even the Russian-mob snuff film ring mentioned has never been supported by any evidence and that's why they are not in jail.

This seems more like an attempt at publicity for these unknown filmmakers than actually being informative.  Although one producer has ONE credential, his story about viewing a ""real snuff film"" is hard to believe and really annoying to watch him tell it.

Those that are familiar with this subject have seen this all before and this is a waste of your time while others will be misinformed on the subject.

Real snuff films do not exist and this dreck just wants to add fuel to the urban legend. 8MM is far more informative and easier to watch than this poor publicity stunt.",1221696000,7,1509,4.617977528089888
8280227,5,B001AYPST8,"Being somewhat of a horror film fan, I was in the mood for some nice splatter and fun gore.  However, I found, to my pleasant surprise, this film doesn't have any of those things.  Why that is so pleasant is because what it did deliver was a disturbing view on the human psyche.  It goes all over the map in terms of range of films covered, from early seventies ""real snuff"" to war footage.  If any one is interested in an intense psychological look into the darkness that is the human experience, this is never to be looked over.  Watch it.",1221609600,7,541,4.316831683168317
