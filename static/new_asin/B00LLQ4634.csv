Love Bill Nighy he's a great actor
This proves it
Comedy is not just his forte",1420934400,,127,4.12
6490522,2,B00LLQ4634,"...is that Johnny Worricker, despite the sympathy that Bill Nighy inspires in the viewer and all the tough but ethical characters he encounters over three episodes ends up not being anyone's idea of a proper hero. He jettisons the two genuine emotional relationships in his life in order to return to a job in a system where ""the establishment always wins"" and where it's revealed he was actually only a pawn.

I loved the legion of talent involved here, but the whole Worricker trilogy was a disappointment. David goes up against Goliath and at the moment of confrontation, he wimps out. Finally it was a true shame to blow all that jazz on just another cog in a corrupt machine. Cool music is for heroes....And just because it comes out of England and looks stylish, doesn't mean it's up to snuff.",1416441600,2,799,4.666666666666667

8666482,5,B00LLQ4634,"I loved this series. I lent the three episodes to a friend to watch. I was shocked that the series dealt with black sites built by American contractors and used by the CIA to torture suspected terrorists, also the Israelis' assassination of a man holding a white flag of surrender. This British series covers controversial topics that I cannot imagine American filmmakers touching.",1422144000,,381,5.063492063492063
