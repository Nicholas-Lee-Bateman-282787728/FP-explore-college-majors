2909676,5,B000TSTEPA,"It's difficult to believe that something this cruel and heartless could be so incredibly funny.  The premise is ideal: there's a snippy bookshop owner who'd rather read than sell anything.  Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) is the owner and he's quite vicious by nature and oddly enough also strangely endearing.  He has one employee, sort of, Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey), who willingly puts up with quite a lot of abuse from Bernard.  Their friend in common is Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig).  She helpfully tries to insert herself between the two but also isn't above pitting one against the other if it will work in her favor.  Booze features heavily throughout the series with hilarious results.  They are a colorful trio of misfits.  My only complaint is there simply aren't enough episodes.  I went through them all too quickly, loving them all, wishing there were more.  Oh well, I'll just have to watch them again.",1390176000,,917,4.934640522875817

2909679,5,B000TSTEPA,The Premise of a misanthropic alcoholic used book shop owner in London united to the outside world almost entirely through the efforts of his two equally eccentric friends works brilliantly to set up some incredibly funny and memorable episodes. If you view this from the beginning it is clear that the 3 main actors developed that chemistry over time because the show just gets better with each episode. Intelligent and incredibly witty scripts delivered by 3 comedians in top form make this an absolute winner of a show. As an aside the instrumental theme song is absolutely addictive once you hear it you will view the credits just to hear it again.,1388361600,2,652,4.830357142857143

Our teen and college age daughters enjoy the humour as much as we do and are currently sharing episodes with their friends. The primary actors give incredible performances and many of the bit character parts are memorable, too. The writing is clever, the scenarios are often a bit surreal, but easy to relate,too. Everyone has a little bit of Bernard  and/or Manny in them.",1372809600,,483,4.890243902439025
2909684,5,B000TSTEPA,"When I first saw this series, some jokes had me thinking, ""What?"" But I found myself thinking about the episodes and then seeing the true humor.  It's not an ""in your face, explain the joke"" comedy.  It's more subtle.  Plus, what more could you ask for than neurotic, hard drinking, somewhat unpleasant individuals finding themselves friends AND a bookstore environment?  It works! What fun!  Favorite episodes have to be ""The Blackout,"" ""Grapes of Wrath,"" and ""Manny Come Home.""  It's unfortunate that it's no longer available for regular purchase. But Spaced is still out there - similar in humor and another series with far reaching resonance and humor.",1369526400,,656,5.08411214953271

2909687,5,B000TSTEPA,"I'm a german girl, but this is not preventing me from watching english movies and series, especially the british ones. `Cause I really love this british sense of humour.
Last week I rummaged in the internet and came across the british series ""Black Books"". I occupied myself a little closer with it and concluded this is something for me. So I bought this series on DVD. Forwhy my English is not so bad and I own a good english-dictionary, and there is subtitle on the DVD, it's quite easy for me to follow the plot.

Now the contents:
""Black Books"" is the name of a book-shop, which owner is Bernard Black.
Bernard is that kind of person you don't want to know anymore, if you just got to know him. He is eccentric, pigheaded, grumpy, lazy, he's lying (especially if it's to his personal advantage) and he has a low opinion of hygienic - with his shop and flat, and also with his own person. His ""hobbies"" are drinking (too much wine), smoking and scaring customers out of his shop. He is a person you want to steer clear of. Anyway, he has real good friend: Fran. She lives in the house next to Bernard's and got a little downstairs decoration-shop. But she's hanging around in Bernard's shop almost the whole time, especially when she is unemployed and had to close her shop at beginning of series two. Fran loves drinking wine and smoking every bit as Bernard, but she is more lovely. Therefore she is a bit crazy and chaotic. The third one is Manny. He is an accountant, but got fired from his old job after a ""work accident"". At Frans insistence, he started workin in the book-shop. And, of course, Bernard had lots of doubts and contradictions but he hired Manny regardless. Manny is courteous, helpful, nice, compassionate and all the opposite of Bernard. And because Manny is also a bit naive, he just doesn't do his work as an accountant. Bernard pushes everything he doesn't want to do to Manny: to serve customers, clean up the shop and the flat, do the laundries, cooking, making breakfast and so on. ""As thanks"", Bernard practise on Manny's weaknesses, just to bother him. But Manny often don't realize that.
With Fran, Manny shares his interests in the ""world outside"". They like to go out, for example to cinema or to parties. If they ask Bernard to come along, maybe going out on Friday night, his standard answer is: ""Why? ... Well, it was Friday night last week and it'll be Friday night next week and every week until we're dead and even then the whole rotten business will go on and on and on."" (Bernard's quotation)
So, in every episode something absurd and weird happens - sometimes borderline situations, but mostly screamingly funny. Such as Bernard's try to sweep out the customers off his shop, or his try to write a children's book with Manny, or both want to integrate a restaurant-service into the book shop.

But aside from this really funny, well worth seeing plots, I'm really impressed by performing 80 to 90 % of this series at only one place - Bernard's shop. And that majority of stories are performed by three persons. That's filmic and acting peak performance. (I saw this just once in the movie called ""Moon"", with Sam Rockwell.)
So my conclusion is: absolutely unmissable!",1353542400,,3213,4.6252189141856395
2909688,5,B000TSTEPA,"Black Books is one of those British comedies with its own brand of quirky ""out there"" humor, so naturally I love it. You can sometimes catch reruns of the series on your local PBS station so you might want to give it a watch (I'd say at least 2 episodes) to make sure it's the right fit for you. The cast of characters are eccentric (and misanthropic, such as Bernard Black) and situations they get themselves into ridiculous. Highly recommended!",1349222400,3,446,4.5875
2909689,5,B000TSTEPA,"The combination of Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey is amazing. You really expect that there is a Black Books somewhere in London with these folks 'running' it, amidst their boozing and mania. There are some really great cameos as well, like Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Pete Serafinowicz. This is a must for any fans of UK Sitcoms (though I am rather reluctant to use that term). And the price was really great too!",1345680000,,409,4.54054054054054
2909690,5,B000TSTEPA,This is one of those shows I feel like I could rewatch at any time. I'd put it up there with SPACED and The It Crowd as one of my top comfort comedies. I also can get people easily hooked on it.,1345248000,,194,3.642857142857143
2909691,5,B000TSTEPA,"Awesome series, Absolutely loved it! Extremely funny show. This was recommended to me because I enjoyed ""Spaced"" with Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes. Very witty comedy.",1341878400,2,166,5.423076923076923
2909692,5,B000TSTEPA,If you like British humor and haven't seen Black Books you should fix that right away. It's a brilliant series that reminds me of Monty Python and the IT Crowd. Hilarious!,1341360000,2,171,4.548387096774194
2909693,5,B000TSTEPA,"My husband and I accidentally came across this series and decided to give it a shot. I have to say we were blown away by it. It was funny, sarcastic, unpredictable and addictive. I adore Bill Bailey, so when I noticed he was in it I was beyond happy. The three main characters in this show work wonderful together and I only wished there had been more seasons. This is one show that will never grow old.",1334275200,3,403,4.246753246753247

2909695,5,B000TSTEPA,"""Black Books"" is a comedic masterpiece. This DVD'set is highly worth it because one can replay it as often as they'd like. I've re-watched all seasons of this show dozens of times after purchasing the DVD's and I laugh hysterically every time as if new. No other show does that for me. Brenard, Manny and Fran are a hilarious trio whose comic personalities balance and compliment each other amazingly. It is no wonder that out of 60 reviews on amazon, this show receives almost only 4 and 5 stars. Those ratings surely reflect the quality of this wonderful show. For fans of this show, I highly suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Book-of-Calm/dp/014026065X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Book of Calm</a>.",1330300800,2,771,5.771929824561403
2909696,5,B000TSTEPA,"I loved reading the other reviews, which made me laugh...because I heartily agree that you do have to be a wee bit deranged or mad to appreciate all that ""Black Books"" offers. So true! I guess I'm ready for the looney bin myself because I loved the show - even thought I caught it rather late here in the States.

Great comedic timing, character-driven brilliance and excellent dialogue. I loved it!",1329782400,2,399,4.619718309859155
2909697,3,B000TSTEPA,"The first season is great. The second season is patchy. The third season is really poor.

This show starts really well - the first few episodes are complete insanity, nicely held together with fantastic writing and lovable characters Unfortunately, it starts to go downhill from there. The clever writing makes way for increasingly slapstick humor, and you get the feeling the show has run out of ideas and is merely running its course. This is highlighted by the increasingly annoying ""laugh track"" - by the 3rd season every little thing results in the ""audience"" clapping as if they have witnessed comedy gold....when actually the joke wasn't even slightly funny. Always a sign a show is on its last legs. By the end it was actually a little bit embarrassing to watch.

I would give the first season 4 stars. Second season 3 stars. Third season 1 star.",1325462400,9,854,4.802721088435374
2909698,5,B000TSTEPA,"Black Books is another of those distinctive British Channel 4 comedies brought to us by the prodigiously talented Graham Linehan. Set in a shabby London bookshop run by terminally dishevelled, permanently drunk, Irish curmudgeon Bernard Black (Dylan Moran), the series takes you on a surreal journey into the depths of... well if not darkness and depravity then, probably, squalidity. With laughs.

It's a very typical Linehan sitcom, set almost exclusively in a single location and rarely straying beyond the boundaries of the book-shop. The premise (if a single theme can be found in a three season series) is Bernard's deep aversion to selling books and his pathological disgust of anyone who might have the temerity to want to buy them. Linehan also seems to have a prodigious talent in bringing together small ensembles of eclectic lead actors and BB is no exception. Thus Bernard is very ably dogged by the naiive and eternally optimistic Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey, may his seed remain ever-fertile) and the socially inept and only slightly less wine-soaked harpy Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig - should she ever wish to mingle her DNA with mine, I shall be happy to oblige). The interplay between these three is what drives the comedy. It seems like Bernard is constantly on the verge of doing terrible violence to Manny, Manny is blithely unaware of how much Bernard hates him, but fully understands how much Bernard needs him. Fran's job, therefore, is both to keeps them apart, but also keep them together.

There are a number of excellent cameos from various other lights of modern BritCom; Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Lucy Davis, Colin McFarlane, Annette Crosbie, Rob Brydon, Peter Serafinowicz and Julian Rhind-Tutt, to name but a few, all drop into the shop for a little of Bernard's choicest abuse, Manny's wide-eyed idiocy or Fran's slightly degrading, predatory flirtations. I think these cameos are what gives the series it's edge. While they don't detract from the central relationship, they add a certain je-ne-sais-quois to proceedings.

It's hard to describe the humour, which has elements of surreality, slapstick, pop-culture, and general silliness. There is however a very strong thread of pathos which holds it all together and keeps it from becoming truly silly (and therefore unfunny). Bernard is (like all curmudgeons) a rather sad creature and he has a parasitic relationship with his two foils, without whom he would probably be dead by now. It's also interesting to note the common themes that can also be seen in Father Ted and The IT Crowd - the concepts of societal isolation and social inadequacy run deep and strong in Black Books.

I think that my favourite episode may be the last of the first series, in which Manny is driven from the shop by Bernard's appaling treatment of him. The poor lamb wanders the mean streets of London until he is ""rescued"" by Omid Djallili who has dubious designs on Manny's beard...

That's the best that I can do to describe it, I'm afraid. I think that, if you've never encountered BB, you can only take your life in your hands, jump straight in and experience it for yourself. Of course it's not going to be for everyone, but if you think that Channel 4 is the rightful King of Comedy, then you will love Black Books and will, I hope, agree that no DVD shelf should be without it.

Interestingly, Linehan relinquished directorship in the second and third series and indeed the writing duties were taken over by Moran and yet the quality did not suffer at all, in my opinion. All three series are equally fantastic a claim that cannot quite be made for the series' successor, The IT Crowd...

Fran: You are being very mean to Manny.
Bernard: I can't help it. He looks like a horse in a man costume!",1323216000,3,3766,4.865834633385336
2909699,5,B000TSTEPA,"Easily the best, the funniest TV sitcom I've seen in the last 10 years, Black Books on the surface appears to be a bookshop version of Fawlty Towers (Bad-tempered owner feels his establishment would be just fine if not for the customers) but Bernard Black is much more than a young Basil Fawlty.  Habitually drunk as well as bad-tempered, slovenly in appearance, home, and mind, he's his own worst enemy: played by series creator and head writer Dylan Moran (who could've been the love-child of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, having Cook's gait and sarcasm and Moore's sensitive face) in perfect pitch.  We applaud Bernard's nerve and iconoclasm and his cutting wit, but we see very clearly his anguish as well.

The supporting players are exceptionally strong; amiable Bill Bailey plays the much-maligned bookshop assistant Manny with an interesting blend of klutziness and sudden blinding ingenuity, while Tamsin Grieg plays neighbouring shop owner Fran Katzenjammer with a quirky reality I've never seen before or since in a female sitcom character, which is all the more remarkable considering the show is written solely by men.  Sometimes flakey but never annoying, Fran is perhaps the most sensible of the three, but never, ever in that awful ""Now boys, play nice"" condescending-mother sort of way that plagues American sitcom women (and doesn't really exist in any woman I've ever met).  Fran has her troubles  but she's far more resilient than Bernard and Manny without ever being cloying about it, which may be what makes her so likable and real.

For all Black Books' accessibility, it should be noted that it does have its occasional segues into the utterly bizarre (Manny swallows a book in the first episode, with consequences both hilarious and very, very weird); something which might put off viewers who prefer more ""normalcy"" in their sitcoms.  It shouldn't.  While Black Books admittedly lives in its own world (as does Bernard himself), it should be a familiar enough world to most of us and well worth visiting.

Besides which, it's just very, very funny.  Highly recommended.",1323043200,2,2094,5.058139534883721
2909700,5,B000TSTEPA,"We only had a few series of Black Books (18 episodes), but what a great show this was. Dylan Moran decided to leave the show, so it was cancelled early, and with a minor cliffhanger that was never and will never be resolved. But for those of us who love British (and Irish) comedy, this is a true masterpiece.

Unlike IT Crowd (the co-creator's later creation), Black Books is truly the genius of one actor with several good but not superb supporting characters. Moran plays Bernard Black, a drunk bookstore owner who loves books so much that he almost always refuses to sell them.

While the supporting cast is very good, they really serve as foils for Black. The others have their moments, but it is when Moran is on screen that the show is at its best.

I highly recommend this show for anyone who enjoys that dry, sarcastic UK style of wit. And the show contains my single favorite comedy moment ever. You'll know what moment when Bernard 'wants his lolli'. I fell off the couch I was laughing so hard!

Great series, one that ended too soon!",1318982400,,1046,4.489473684210527

This show is fantastic. The humor here is just the right blend of smart and slapstick. It's excellently written, perfectly cast and expertly acted. Dylan Moran is superb as the alcoholic misanthrope Bernard, and is quite adorable in a peculiar way.  At present I've only gotten almost through the first two seasons and already have lines and jokes stuck in my head  randomly making me laugh throughout the day.  Benard's frozen wine ""lollipop"" in particular had me cackling with glee. (Is that not the best idea ever?) It's really a shame that only three seasons were made, but this show definitely holds up to repeated viewings - and you will want to watch again and again just to catch all the jokes.

The writing is superb, the oddball situations hilarious, and the acting first-rate. I was delighted to buy my own set of the three series, as watching it more than once reveals myriad subtleties and details missed earlier.  What a treat.

It's a given that none do the smart, cheeky - and un-cheeky - stuff better.  Still, I had to read others' reviews on this all-too-unknown [in the Colonies]and under-appreciated series, and step out in trust with my fellow BBC devotees.  Even then, I wasn't sure what to expect from otherwise vague descriptors that struggle to characterize this work, and selfishly hope to keep the best a coveted secret.

What I found was sheer BRILLIANCE! I'd even go so far as to say that there's never been such a perfect confluence of comedic writing and acting, EVER!  The cast is utter perfection...The characters are so well done!...And who could forget Bernard's rosy, Vintage, frozen Lollie, among the myriad other bright spots?

It's rich and funny, and it leaves one either dying for a sip and a fag, or having some epiphany about how little they care about how far afield they've been led.  It's a total play on all things absurd...

2909707,5,B000TSTEPA,"How can I explain this show to someone who's never seen it? It's centered around three people that drink and smoke and do things that are bad for them, and they love it. They don't really give much though to the future or anyone other than themselves on a regular basis, they live in the moment, and they all have weird things about them that keep them interesting and their interaction lively. The writing is witty and fresh and I think it's hilarious!

Dylan Moran is great at observational humor and designed characters that shine in a simple setting. It's not as dry as a lot of British comedies and makes for a wonderful change. Observational humor, witty dialouge, physical comedy, and crazy (yet perfectly polished) guest characters create a great show with a wonderful sense of comedic timing -- you never think: they're setting up a joke here; the punchline is always a suprise. I laugh out loud every time I watch this show and I have my favorite episodes, but I never skip a single one.

And to my BBC comerades: if you like Chef!, Vicar of Dibley, or Father Ted you'll love this one, just snap it up!",1294531200,2,1112,4.527363184079602
2909708,5,B000TSTEPA,"It's not been a good day.  Nick The Accountant is a fugitive, Fran can't figure out what these round things she just bought for her gift shop are, and poor Manny has just swallowed The Little Book of Calm, which will either kill him if it turns to the left or cause permanent, painful scarring of his renal canal if it turns to the right, although he may be able to live up to ten years in unrelenting agony . . .  Oh, and Bernard is trying to find a way of getting someone to disable him so he won't have to do his taxes (on the plus side, his misc. receipts make a stylish casual jacket).

This is just the first episode of BLACK BOOKS, a casually outrageous sitcom about a lonely, tippling fellow named Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) who runs a bookshop despite the fact that he hates most of his customers.  His main consolations besides booze are friendship with fellow incipient-alcoholic Fran (Tasmin Greig) who runs the gift shop next door, and his twisted, dysfunctional relationship with his assistant Manny (Bill Bailey), who lost his job as an accountant after the whole swallowing-The-Little-Book-of-Calm thing.  I haven't even mentioned the Mormon missionaries who are amazed to actually be allowed into someone's home (Bernard's avoiding doing his taxes, and he's already sorted his socks), the house-cleaner, the rare bottle of wine, or any of the other misadventures that plague this triumvirate of hapless souls during the course of three seasons.  I would say that the central trio, Baker, Bailey, and Grieg, are three of the most appealing leads I've ever seen in a sitcom, and that the scripts (Some by Baker, some by Baker in collaboration with Graham Linehan, some by Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley), are wonderful not only because of the sheer accumulation of gaggage, but for finding ways to deepen and complicate the characters without ever allowing Bernard to go soft or anyone to accumulate anything resembling common sense or a capacity for survival.

Creative thinking can be a tax write-off.

If these rules don't make any sense to you,  watch Black Books and be enlightened.  You don't even need to ingest The Little Book of Calm.

2909721,5,B000TSTEPA,"I bought this whilst on foreign exchange in order to share the majesty of Black Books with some like-minded Americans. In that capacity, this modest dvd boxed-set was entirely competent. There is a reasonably-long compulsory advert for other such programs at the beginning, although we had already started on the wine by this point, so perhaps our inability to skip the pre-amble was not so much the dvd's fault as it was ours.
A criticism, if I am forced to find one, is that the plastic poppy centre bits that hold the snugly in place could fit a little better. If you were to, say, drunkenly drop this product down some stairs, you would inevitably find that the disks had come loose within the packaging, and this might result in scratching.

I'm sure that you're already familiar with Black Books. If you are, and find yourself in America, or even find yourself to be American, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.

2909723,4,B000TSTEPA,"The best part of BLACK'S BOOKS is Bernard Black (Dylan Moran), the owner. He takes being obnoxious and drunk to the nth degree.  Perhaps the only reason he owns a bookstore is to remain conscious on a daily basis.  His comic foil is his assistant Manny, (Bill Bailey), who is sober and nice.  Naturally, Bernard's chief joy in life is to make Manny's life as hellish as possible by antagonizing him at every turn.  These two work well as a comic duo but they are painted in even broader strokes than Edie & Patsy in ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. I never quite enjoyed the comedy in this show as much as I did the comedy in ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS or ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES.  I think BLACK'S BOOKS perhaps pushes the comic duo so hard that at times it goes too far and right over the edge.  The other two shows managed to not go over the cliff but go right to the edge of it.  Also, I could have eliminated the third character in his show, the woman shop owner next to them, Edie Fran (Tamsin Greig), their oldest friend.  This is a fun show, enjoyable, but I just don't adore the comedy in it the way the other reviewers here at Amazon do. Perhaps nothing varies as much though as each person's personal sense of the absurd.

There are, or rather, were (RIP Arrested Development) some amazing comedies in America but I find myself always coming back to the Brit shows like the beloved Black Books here or Absolutely Fabulous, and Green Wing to name a few.

I've got a friend that said this previously was not available in Region 1 (only 2--which is for most of Europe, some of the Middle East and a few other countries while 1 is for the US and Canada). This had been on my holiday with list for a while, and no one bought it but then I saw the price had dropped and I jumped on it. I'm glad to see more things previously unavailable to America (and Canada) that is quality TV.

This show is absolutely hilarious. Even from just the pilot, I knew I'd love this show. Bernard Black as an introverted bibliophile and alcoholic and his only friend Fran Katzenjammer, and the accountant turned assistant to his book store Manny Bianco who is delightfully complacent (for the most part) after accidentally swallowing The Little Book of Calm. As goes with many comedies, this is a recipe for chaos and amusement as only Britain could do it.

Every episode is funny and quotable in its own way, although the first episode is the best.  The only bad thing I could say about this show is they should have made more episodes!

This collection gives you all three seasons (series in the UK) for less than the price of buying them individually.  The minor flaw with this collection is that, unlike the collection released in Australia, this one consists of 3 full-size DVD cases in a flimsy box.  The Australian version is a flat-pack, where the DVDs sit in plastic frames in a foldout that slides into a sleeve.  That release is about half as wide as this one.

My American wife and all her family have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series many times it never seems to become old, the jokes and situations never cease to make us laugh.
Through this series my sister in law has become a great Bill Bailey fan and has watched Half Troll well over a dozen times.
The down side, we are the only members of the family with a multi region DVD player and until these DVD's were available in the US they could only watch when they visited.
Also, US prices do not seem to have any parity with UK prices probably because demand is less here. However, sometimes the relatively high prices must dissuade many people purchasing DVD's like this on speculation.
I read once that DVD prices were based the economy of each country where they were sold and the maximum the distributers thought that they could get away with charging in those countries therefore, reigonal coding was introduced to prevent people buying the same product a lot cheaper from elsewhere in the world.
Unlike analog reproduction digital reproduction is not area / system specific, its just that the players are coded to make it that way. However, that coding can very easily be removed.
Now DVD producers are encoding the DVD's so that they will not work in multi region players, seems freedom of choice and real commercial competition is only an illusion.",1231113600,2,1442,4.681102362204724

Each season of this show it great, and worth watching over and over again. After watching my downloaded versions of this, I decided to check it out on Amazon and see if they had it. Lo and Behold, they had it... and it was on sale. So, needless to say, I picked it up and eagerly waited for its arrival--just so I could watch it again.

This is seriously one of the best shows to ever come out of England, and it makes me sad that there's only 3 seasons of this.

2909737,5,B000TSTEPA,"The English have a genre no one else has anywhere in the world. They call that comedies on television. Short less than half an hour episodes of situational humor positioned in one particular social niche. In this case it is a marginal book store held by a social drop out who hates all other human beings and yet cannot survive without constant contact with some of these strange animals we call human beings. Unable to love, unable to have any sentimental life with any person that would approach a gender definition. Yet he recuperate in his book store that becomes a haven for stray cats, though he hates cats, a flunked and failed accountant who is fired from his job because he is kind of abnormal for the job, both in looks and behavior. And he has a neighborly relation with the next door shop lady who is soon going to get out of business and remain behind like an errant animal. And the three of them are going to live the daily life of this book store. But it is nothing close to a social drama or anything social. It is nothing like a soap opera or even a sitcom. Those are more American, more normal, banal and less out of the way, funny or strange. The fun in American sitcoms or soap operas comes from the wit of the characters. The fun of English comedies comes from the situation and the slight details in the behavior, appearance, reactions of the characters that make them weird. There is always something unforeseen and unforeseeable because so much out of the way that we could not even think of it as being possible. Each episode has one unifying element that may get some follow up in the next episode, but there is no obligation. So the episode is not supposed to end on any suspense but on a punch line that signs the end as inescapable. And that final touch or detail is so amazing that you can only sit there flabbergasted and laughing like a baboon in the jungle shade. Have you ever heard one? Very weird, the laughter of the baboon. If you haven't I would advise you to go fast to some jungle and hear it, record it and then multiply it one thousand time into a two or three hour long baboon laughter. That should make you both happy and sad for some time and give you some pleasant dreams. Just like Black Books if you can put your hands or your dirty grubby fatty fingers on the series.

2909738,5,B000TSTEPA,"Black Books as a profoundly comic British TV show.  Similar to Seinfeld, the show revolves around Bernard Black (Dylan Moran), Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey), and Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig) in Bernard's bookshop.

The combination of Bernard's rude, cynical demeanor toward customers and his friends is highly entertaining.  Manny has transitioned to the shop from a high-stress regular job and now spends his time minding the shop while taking constant flak from Bernard.  A wonderful dark comedy that you cannot find in America...anywhere.  There's many great quotes that are instantly memorized thanks to the sheer aptness and unmistakable abusive nature for the moment.  The constant wine drinking and smoking by characters is something rather absurd in American culture today, but Dylan Moran (also a writer of the scripts) manages to find many amusing methods to underline the characters' apparent addiction while keeping the show from dwelling on the fact through the episode.

Myself and many friends have fully enjoyed Black Books and plan on a marathon of the show.  It's just a shame that, ""The Complete Black Books"" is only three seasons long.  At only 6 episodes per season, it may seem a stretch for the price, but there are extra features available such as trailers for new seasons, outtakes, a few other shorts and additions, and commentary (which sometimes can get annoying and you don't get much that is interesting.  The characters just sound like they're talking you through the whole scene with some of their backstage anecdotes).  Commentary is the only real drawback for the seasons.

I highly recommend this to the audiences of British comedy.  If you haven't watched anything from this genre before, this is a good start if you're not the type to easily hold contempt for people's vices or first impressions.  The episodes are well written.

I saw some clips of this show online and I instantly bought the whole set when I found that I could get it for DVD Region 1",1212192000,10,1991,5.027439024390244

2909740,5,B000TSTEPA,"Watching ""Black Books"" is the cinematic equivalent of a nonsensical Woody Allen novel - nothing makes much sense, the plot is as dubious as the characters, and the one-liners keep coming at breathless speed. Still, it is this zany, goofy, flat-out bizarreness that makes ""Black Books"" such an unexpected treat.

Be forewarned however, that this may not be for everyone. You definitely have to be a little 'out there' to get it. If you like straight-forward comedy such as ""Fawlty Towers"" or more languid, slow-paced comedy such as ""Father Ted"", then you may NOT like this, primarily because the entire show is a bit deranged and set in a mad, mad world that is entirely dialog-driven. You MUST be a fan of the written word to 'get' most of the comedy here, and you certainly have to be a bit spaced out to appreciate the finer moments here. Fans of ""Little Britain"" and the morbid ""The League of Gentlemen"" will readily fall in love with this show.

On paper, ""Black Books"" looks rather unremarkable. A self-loathing lunatic book-shop owner hires a fat, squat, balding hippie as his book-assistant. Thats pretty much it. But to watch this highly uninteresting concept take flight and become one of the greatest TV shows ever to grace Planet Earth is a revelation indeed. ""Black Books"" is a certifiable classic - near flawless in every way, and lead actor Dylan Moran proves that he is a master of comedy, both situational and slapstick.

A true work of art - this is one collection that you need to have in your possession. ""Black Books"" still remains a 'cult' show that not many people know about. In fact, its nowhere near the huge popularity of ""Little Britain"", but get it, watch it alone, and savor the spirit of true comedy.

#1 - Black Adder. Black Books is this classic serial revisited in spirit, but certainly not copied. The dynamic between the lead and the supporting cast are similar, but setting, acting and plot development allow for a very well sown comedy crop.

#2 Red Dwarf. The brief span of Black Books almost automatically relegates it behind Red Dwarf in the standings. However, while Red Dwarf's Lister is as funny and endearing as any character created, Black Books Bernard Black is far more identifiable, equally clever, and far more sardonic.

Now, I have to say, I am open to enjoying many forms of comedy, but Black Books consistently has me going into seizures of laughter. I don't know why, but the unique and particular TIMING in their shows is the key to my personal HUMOR button. Mind you, I love FAWLTY TOWERS, and I LOVE Eddie IZZARD stand up, but Black Books never fails to throw me into hysterical fits of laughter when the afore-mentioned items have even grown cold.
Black Books touches a sarcasm bone I didn't know existed. Normally I enjoy the standard issue sarcasm and high-brow humor, but Black Books takes all that one step further and even adds a little Simon Pegg and his stark, straight-man-humor--as was so aptly illustrated in Shaun of the Dead-- and integrates that to Black books as well.
Black Books has a little of ""everything"" in it, as long as the everything is BRITISH humor. And I have to say it tickles my funny bone every single time I watch it. I can't say enough GOOD about BLACK BOOKS. But like all comedy, you have to see it yourself to determine if it is funny to you personally. So try an episode, give it a shot.

There was no talk of an American DVD distribution of this show at the time, so I bought the first season straight from Channel 4's store (Region 2), the french version of the second season (also Region 2 but with no extras) and finally the complete season a year and a half later.

I am seriously considering buying this Region 1 version of this show (so buying it for a third time) just so I can show it to friends that don't have region-free DVD drives. It's a shame that they only lasted 3 seasons!",1193529600,4,607,4.232758620689655

Bookstores are one of my favorite places to spend time in so it is a shock to watch bookshop owner Bernard Black (Dylan Moran)  antagonize folks (who are silly enough to darken his door).

When I finish the series -- usually by binge-watching -- I feel reassured that at least I'm a bit more sane than the three crazies on the DVD's. This is the funniest series ever and I'm so thankful I have the set.",1480809600,,567,4.127272727272727

Tried again with the 3 disk set.  First disk was fine. Second disk defaulted to captions on and the on disk menu wouldn't turn them off, luckily the dvd player settings would turn them off.  Third disk unrecognized format in DVD player, but our laptop could play it.  However it was corrupted and wouldn't play anything past the middle of the 4th episode.

8210780,5,B000TSTEPA,"Somewhere in London, there is a tiny indie bookstore run by the rudest and most misanthropic Irishman since Father Jack Hackett.

Nobody in their right mind would actually shop at Black Books. But watching it? That's a whole other story -- ""The Complete Black Books"" is one of the funniest and most underrated Britcoms in history, mixing gloriously wacky dialogue (""I ate all your bees!"") with characters so dysfunctional that it is amazing they can even stay alive. This is one of those rare shows that is practically perfect in every way.

Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) runs Black Books in the heart of London... except he seems to have started his business without the awareness that PEOPLE come to bookstores. As a result, he does whatever he can to avoid selling or buying books because that would be work he doesn't want to do. His only friend is Fran (Tamsin Greig) who owns a pretentious junk store two doors down.

And after a bizarre situation involving taxes, skinheads and ""The Little Book of Calm,"" Bernard drunkenly offers a job to mild-mannered ex-accountant Manny (Bill Bailey). But this sparks off a bunch of new problems for the odd little trio -- beard prostitution, papal wine, being locked out, mysterious injuries, piano lessons, ""Dave's Syndrome,"" illiteracy, cheap holidays, yoga and veganism, invisible critters, a chain bookstore, Manny's parents, gambling and an attempt to assassinate a cat.

""Black Books"" was co-created by Graham Linehan, who also made ""Father Ted"" and ""The IT Crowd. It's honestly a shame that it hasn't gotten the widespread love that those shows have -- this is one of those comedies where everything is just RIGHT. The cast, the characters, the writing, the mundane situations blossoming into sheer absurdity -- this is comic gold in every vein.

This is one of those shows that takes something mundane -- house-sitting, vacations, writing a children's book -- and explodes it into absurdity. In fact, the life of the main characters gets progressively weirder as the series goes on, especially when it makes an effort to address the surreal wonderland that is Manny and Bernard's home. When Fran decides to sleep in Bernard's bed, Manny hands her some bananas. Why? ""Oh no, they're not for you, just chuck them under the bed... We just call it... The Thing.""

It doesn't hurt that the dialogue is gutsplittingly funny (""Yes, it'll be some time before I want to sacrifice another monkey."" ""WE SAID WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT CANADA!""). Every scene and subplot is packed with this sort of interplay, like Bernard hanging out in a porn shop asking for the most obscure kind he can think of (""Senior Administrative Nurses""), just so he won't have to pennilessly wander the cold wet streets for a few more minutes.

But the real crowning gem is the cast. All three of them have superb chemistry with each other, and they fill their roles out nicely -- the hardcore misanthrope, the nice guy, and the sensible person who deals with them both. Series co-creator/star Moran is absolutely hysterical, with his mad-scientist hair and his constant efforts to keep people out of his store, but there's something weirdly endearing about Bernard's grumpy-cat face and constant complaints. Maybe he just voices some of the less-tolerable thoughts we all have (""Get your own human play-thing, you quartz-brained little cream puff!"").

But don't downplay how much Greig and Bailey bring to it -- Bailey plays a sweet innocent guy who balances out Bernard's sourness while sometimes living in his own little world, while Greig plays a hilarious woman who has a disastrous love life and a shop full of useless gadgets she can't even identify. And if you squint, you can find early appearances by pre-fame Martin Freeman, Simon Pegg, Rob Brydon and Nick Frost.

""The Complete Black Books"" is one of those rarest of sitcoms: the ones that are actually good and funny almost all the time. No one can truly call themselves a Britcom fan unless they've seen this one.",1403481600,,3990,4.943283582089553
