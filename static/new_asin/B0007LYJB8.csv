8159737,3,B0007LYJB8,"This is an interesting piece of work. I gave this three stars for this pseudo-documentary for showing us rare film footage of post WWII Germany and this comes with a suggestion. You might want to turn off the sound entirely and put on some classical music or something, because the film is very poorly edited. The entire background music is ""My Way"" by Frank Sinatra, repeated over and over again in an incredibly annoying loop, and what makes it worse is that it is a ""Muzak"" instrumental of the song. This will appeal to hard-core WWII buffs and scholars, but as ""entertainment"" it is nearly unwatchable. If this were actually produced by professionals, it would make great source material.",1478908800,,692,4.823529411764706
8159738,5,B0007LYJB8,We know so little how the Germans and most other Europeans needed to do to survive the devastion of Allied bombing during WWII. The remarkable recovery of Germany aided by the American Marshall Plan shows the resilience of Germans in the face of many hardships. Of course we cannot ever forget the horrows caused by the Nazis to Jews and other Europeans. The film gives a candid look at a destroyed Germany which most Americans have never seen other than the occupying forces.,1477526400,,476,4.746987951807229
8159739,1,B0007LYJB8,"Waste of my time.  There are so  many well produced videos on WW II. This is definitely not one of them.  As a 45 year production company, we'd be embarrassed to have this product on the market.  Repeating ""My Way"" music?  Go figure.  Hope the royalties were paid.  Write up on Amazon should not be allowed as it misrepresents what the video content really is.",1325462400,,360,4.446153846153846
8159740,1,B0007LYJB8,"Just thrown together footage not worth the price. And why impose a soundtrack of a never ending looping instrumental version of the Frank Sinatra song ""My Way""? Don't get taken, avoid this!",1233878400,,189,4.9375
8159741,3,B0007LYJB8,"This Movie shows the German city famous and non famous to the outsider how it looks like 28 months after the D Day !  so sad to see Germany become like that and nothing and it makes you even more sad if you see the newsreel and how Germany looks like before the war.
German city were famous for its traditional and cultural rich architecture but it's all ruin !!
some of the clips are simply private tour and they don't really take full round scene at each city but snap shots from her  and there which make you annoy some times . no narrator and just music "" my way"" on saxophone  repeated over and over ..

it is good to watch to give you somehow a close idea of how the German people suffer from the war and how their cities turned to rabble due to the Allied Air Raid which is  savages goes behind imagination",1184284800,,813,4.120253164556962
8159742,5,B0007LYJB8,"Who knew just how bad Germany was hit by world war 2? In school they taught us about the Marshall Plan but I didn't realize that we did that because we almost ruined an entire country.

I watched this DVD with my mouth agape. There is a lot of footage of complete rubble on the ground and people's lives were destroyed.

I didnt' think anything could make me feel bad for the Germans after WW2 but this disk did.",1146096000,9,412,4.2025316455696204
8159743,5,B0007LYJB8,"This DVD was very creepy, but I'm glad I ordered it. When I learned about WWII in history the videos we saw of the end of the war were all about American soldiers coming home victorious.

What I never thought about was what happened to the countries that lost the war.

When I watched this DVD it brought home to me that there were a lot of innocent German people who had their lives ruined and cities destroyed - even though they had nothing to do with the Nazis.

There is no narration or commentary on the DVD, but that just made it scarier for me - in a good way.",1146009600,8,567,4.09009009009009
8159744,1,B0007LYJB8,"This movie was put together piecemeal using old Army handheld footage.  The first two-thirds of the DVD is simply old footage of a bombed out Germany.  After 2-3 minutes it all looks the same.  There is no narration whatsoever.  The final third of the movie is an old documentary of a day in the life of a German family.  Very boring.  Uninspiring.  This could have been an opportunity to convey some insight using old footage; however the auther of this DVD obviously piecemealed a bunch of old footage together and slapped a price on it.  In fact, the guy that gave this five star review... has given a bunch of other videos similar ratings and similar misleading reviews.  Just read his.  This is a total rip-off!!",1130371200,14,717,4.619047619047619
8159745,5,B0007LYJB8,"At the end of World War I Germany surrendered. But the military was convinced that this was because of a failure of will on the part of the German home front rather than a defeat on the battlefield. During the second world war the Allies decided that this wouldn't happen again. The Allies insisted on unconditional surrender of the German Army. This happened only after the country was basically destroyed.

The famous air raids into Germany by the Americans during the day and the British at night really didn't do much in the early years of the war. But by 1945 the number of planes, the tactics, and the Allies long range fighters had all come together so that the ability to destroy large parts of any city existed. And this force was used.

One major target had been the fuel supplies. Germany was forced to greatly expand their use of synthetic fuels. And during the last months of the war virtually all of the potato crop was used to produce fuel. This left the prospect of starvation of the German people.

After the final surrender, Germany was starving, without shelter (and the coldest winter in many years). The Allies worked to rebuild Germany into a working nation, so as to not leave a festering sore to start the next world war.

This DVD is about the destruction and rebuilding of Germany.",1119830400,9,1307,4.620689655172414
