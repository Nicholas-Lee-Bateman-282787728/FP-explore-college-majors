7358551,1,B012UORWJ0,"Unless I see clear evidence that the DVD set for season 2 includes a replacement disk for Season 1's disk 2, which was missing from all the season 1 sets, I will not be getting this.  I bought the DVDs and could only view episodes 1-3 and 7-13 because the disk with episodes 4-6 was missing (actually, it was printed and included but had the wrong episodes on it so you got 2 disks with disk 4 content but no disks with disk 2 content).  This was true of both replacement sets, and I believe that the seller eventually discovered that all his copies were similarly affected, so it seems to have been a widespread problem, so unless the studio makes good in the season 2 set, forget it.",1447891200,5,685,4.3023255813953485

7358555,2,B012UORWJ0,Even the wonderful Ms Berry cannot save this rough prog script. Too poor writing and story and with several actors I just cannot like.,1496534400,,134,4.625

8726650,5,B012UORWJ0,"Season 2 is better than season 1 in my opinion, the addition of Jeffrey Dean Morgan really makes a difference. Both seasons were good, season 2 just better. I am sorry they discontinued this series, there is much that could have been done with it. Great series, great season.  I would have thought that with the star power behind this series it would be salvageable but not even Spielberg, Berry and Morgan could save it.",1498003200,2,421,4.613333333333333
