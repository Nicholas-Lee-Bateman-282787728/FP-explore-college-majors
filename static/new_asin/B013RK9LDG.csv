7370778,4,B013RK9LDG,"Contrary to the negative reviews and my low expectations going in I really liked the movie. Tobe Hooper obviously had the difficult task of making a ghost story/thriller/horror film by being respectful of Arab cultural mores within the movie as well having the actors move between using Arabic and English (which was done quite well and I actually liked). The movie does a good job of showing how deeply superstitious Arab culture is within the context of the modernity of Dubai. The movie humanizes the Arab characters and doesn't play to stereotypes or caricatures. There is a scene where the Arab American couple are speaking and the wife says ""I only spoke Arabic for my parents"". This movie is not only about scary ghosts but about the sometimes difficult cultural identity issues ethnic people face. I would recommend this for a Sunday afternoon. A definite popcorn movie",1464566400,3,877,4.9727891156462585

7370783,1,B013RK9LDG,I would give it less stars if I could. That would be my wish from a Djinn who would make this film disappear along with a few less star ratings!! What a pile of (middle eastern word for crap)! This one is as total stinker. Is it wrong for wishing bad mojo to happen to the script writer? I think not! You will agree there is not a mystical creature in the world that could grant you 3 wishes to put this genie back in that bottle! I think the actors might be cursed too!,1455235200,,470,3.957894736842105
8728563,4,B013RK9LDG,"My take is that this is a Middle Eastern ""Rosemary's Baby"".  Deals primarily with the Afrit and/or Ghul classes of Djinn, although not defined in the movie.  I suggest some research on the Djinn, which describes ""changeling"" babies and possession of humans per Arabic mythology or Islamic teachings; take your pick. I'm not a fan of single site horror movies, aka ""cabins in the woods, etc.""  But this version worked.",1531267200,,417,4.928571428571429

8728568,3,B013RK9LDG,"Very okay, and that's not meant as a bad thing. It definitely had some creep factor, but it's Tobe Hooper, so you expect that. A bit slow, a bit claustrophobic, but otherwise good.",1506643200,,180,4.484848484848484

8728571,2,B013RK9LDG,"To begin, I wasn't expecting much when I saw this movie - it seemed like it was going to be one of those typical horror movies that go for the cheap scares. However, I was *really* interested in the premise, because it was unique in that it contained arabic folklore as well as religion, cultural identity, a different type of location, and mixed Arabic with English language.

In a nutshell, an Arabic couple living in NY move back to the UAE after their baby dies. They go back because the husband is offered a job there, as well as to reconnect with the wife's family. She's deeply opposed to the move but goes along anyway. The high-rise they're staying in is built directly on an old village associated with a (female) djinn and her long lost baby. All kinds of horrible tales are associated with the old town.
This is the bare bones of the story pretty much.
What happens from that point on is a complete disaster in terms of storytelling. The story pretty much 'begins' when the couple leaves the US and arrives in their new location and everything seems to take place within basically the first 24 hours. The pacing is insane in that it doesn't leave any room for suspense, unless you count the cheap scares. The movie borrows heavily from Rosemary's Baby, Devil's Advocate, The Grudge, and probably some other stuff. Which is really sad, because it did not *need to* do that at all. It could have been its own unique creature - it already set itself up as unique in so many other ways - and instead leans on very tired, generic horror tropes.
The writing is fairly bad, the dialogue stilted, and the acting in couple of areas is outrageously awful.
At one point, right after the couple arrives in their new place, the wife sees her own family (whom she misses dearly) and reconnects with them. As soon as they leave to go home and the wife is with her husband, she starts complaining about how she hates coming back and doesn't want to be there. What the....?! It makes no sense!
There is no depth in this movie. It made me so frustrated to watch it, because it just felt like a huge, missed opportunity. I really wish there were other movies with arabic folklore I could watch, ones which have a bit more intelligence and thoughtful writing, but I've not been able to find anything.

I give this movie 2 stars for its original/unique setting/premise, and no other stars, because it squandered its chances.",1473292800,2,2415,4.549425287356322
8728572,5,B013RK9LDG,"A believable character/plot/story.  The story creates confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of Djinn, although without absolute proof there in lies the rub.",1473206400,,177,5.8076923076923075
