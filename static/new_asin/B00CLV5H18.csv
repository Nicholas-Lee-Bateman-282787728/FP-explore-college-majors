8583186,5,B00CLV5H18,"If you want to be happy and fit get on this bandwagon! Happy Couple Workout is incredible. Other fitness routines are fueled by this malcontent or negative energy around what is wrong and needs to be fixed. This program is based in a totally different focus/energy/culture of putting more momentum behind what's amazing and good in your life. I'm happily married, my husband and I are happy with my body, I'm happy with my energy levels-- I just never had enough negative motivation to really stick with a work out program because I wasn't that unhappy with my fitness level. Alana has completely inspired me. I work out 5-7 times a week now, am in the best shape of my life and have energy and motivation like never before. Get the DVD. Get the happy couple creed. Get inspired by the culture. Get fit. Get happy.",1422748800,2,814,4.582191780821918
8583187,5,B00CLV5H18,"Rickard and Alana have created a workout routine that is both rigorous and fun. As parents of a toddler, it's hard to find time to go to the gym. This video allows us to incorporate a 20-30 minute workout into our mornings--and we can all do it together. Our son started requesting ""Happy Couple Workout"" by name before he could even say many words because he has so much fun trying to imitate the moves (which frees us up to actually get a good workout in!). This is the perfect solution for busy families who don't want to sacrifice family time in order to stay fit.",1377043200,3,568,4.367924528301887
8583188,5,B00CLV5H18,"The care and thought that went into this video is incredible.  This couple takes away all the need for a gym and makes even a simple walk in the park an exercise experience when you are with another person.  No equipment needed.  Just you, another close friend/partner and a few simple moves.  Great idea!  I love it!",1368230400,2,317,4.491228070175438
