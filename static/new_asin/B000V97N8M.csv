8217378,5,B000V97N8M,"Even though I am one of the artists on this performance DVD, such a bias could go either way (I tend to be more self-critical). Viewing this performance so many years later, i have to say it is really great and holding up exceptionally well.  It is a great performance, it was an awesome evening and audience. A wonderful ensemble of women.  Lisa Otey does a fab job of herding a crew of irreverent, wild, incorrigible Divas together. get the DVD, watch it, share it w friends.  you'll like it.  and these prices!  i can tell you first hand it took Lisa about $25 bucks each DVD to produce these.  its not only an excellent concert, its a quality recording and editing job, too.  film Produced by Lisa Otey and Cindy Wing.",1324598400,,722,4.424242424242424
8217379,5,B000V97N8M,"This DVD of a 2004 concert by Lisa Otey's Desert Divas spotlights each singer in all her BOA-U-TIFUL splendor!  From the very first notes of ""I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl"", you know you're in for a great time!  Each song is more engaging than the last, from Hurricane Carla's sexy saxophone to Anna Warr's sultry ""When You're Good To Mama"" to Liz McMahon's sassy confession that ""He Ain't Mr. Right, (but he's Mr. Right-Now)""!  Lisa's own solo turn with ""I Hope You Dance"" amply demonstrates why she's been Tucson's favorite chanteuse for many years, and her powerhouse piano playing is dynamic and great fun throughout!  Another standout is drummer Jon Westfall's solo towards the end of the concert.  My personal favorite number is the Jon Hendricks classic ""I Want You To Be My Baby"" - but every song sparkles with Diva sauciness.  Additional original songs by Lisa are featured in the Bonus material, where Lisa, Carla, Anna, Kathleen, Liz and Regina the Queen let their hair down and play up their uniquely charming selves.  The concert footage is expertly recorded and filmed, and the tasteful editing make this a most rewarding DVD to own and enjoy again and again!  VIVA LA DIVA!!",1294185600,,1192,4.780487804878049
