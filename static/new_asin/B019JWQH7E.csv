I love horror movies, I love vampire movies, I love B movies, I love bad movies and this film had all that going for it and still this was hard to watch. A combination of a lot of things made it hard to watch but over all I think it was the hard to follow story, even though the storyline was simple enough I guess but the way it was presented was, ugh. The acting was bad and not bad/good except maybe a single person or two, hard to remember. Also the heavy accents made it hard to understand some people especially when the audio wasn't high enough on the flick.

The story follows three journalists who have learned of a vampire cult in Transylvania. Naturally they are looking for the story a get an interview with one of the cult members. Unfortunately they don't know how dangerous this will become as vampires are very much real and after them as well. Add on to all of that there is a woman that has went missing and posted a video of herself asking for help. Who is this woman and can they find her?

To be fair I like the idea behind the storyline and there are parts that do look cool because of how they were shot. But then you have a lead vampire who may be the sloppiest vampire ever as another reviewer pointed out. I also liked the scene with the missing woman, but whatever happened with .. never mind just wait and see. You get trailers on the DVD and that is about it. I would have liked a behind the scenes or something just see what everyone was thinking on this. A commentary by writer/director Attila Luca would have been great.",1464134400,2,1568,4.25503355704698
8745415,1,B019JWQH7E,"This movie undoubtedly is possibly the absolute worst movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life from childhood until now, and i'm 49 years old and have thousands of movies in my collection. For one thing, I don't know what country they cast these so called actors from, but they all either look friggin down right weird, anorexic, or just plain been beatin by an ugly stick! I've seen 5 year olds in commercials act 10 times better than these weirdos, an so far as the plot goes, there isn't one. Except for the fact that the entire movie is a few reporters trying to track down a vampire cult to get a one on one interview with a vampire cult. But the thing that bothers me is that even when they should realize that the vampires don't exactly want to sit down and have a chat, and their friends are being killed off left and right, they act mortified when they lose one another but can't figure out that the vampires aren't particularly chatty! So the movie goes on and finally get to Translyvania where the last one or two gets killed by the sloppiest blood drinking vampires who seem to waste more blood than drink it. And it ends in the most stupid way too. But hey! I'm not going to deprive you of having to sit and suffer as I did hoping it would at least finally make since by giving the ending away. And by the way, aren't vampires supposed to have super human strength? Hell at the very beginning of the movie you are dumbfounded by the fact that after a vampire finishes off a meal from one of the anorexic female actors, he tries to pick her up and carry her off, and you can clearly see the guy straining to get a good grip and lift her. Funny as s***!",1459468800,2,1672,4.228125
