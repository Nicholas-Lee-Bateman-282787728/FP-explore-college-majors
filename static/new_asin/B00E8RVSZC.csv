5896234,5,B00E8RVSZC,As was with the previous five seasons this was a well produced series.  Again great storys and super acting.  Warner Bros had a real winner in this series.  Clint Walker was the right choice to play the lead in this TV series.,1380672000,,226,4.333333333333333
5896235,5,B00E8RVSZC,Cheyenne was one of the first adult westerns.  The quality of the shows was right up there with Gunsmoke.  Clint Walker has been my favorite cowboy for almost 50 years.  Visit his website for up to date info on the big guy.,1380412800,,223,4.261904761904762

We find they have very good story lines, the quality of both the picture and sound are very good. We continue to watch for any further to be released in the future. Thanks to both Amazon and Warner Bros.",1379462400,,441,4.127906976744186

5896238,5,B00E8RVSZC,"I always loved the character of Cheyenne because he was truthful, moral, and had integrity, characteristics so lacking today.

5896292,5,B00E8RVSZC,"""Cheyenne"" is a western I didn't watch on TV until several years back when I caught it on the Western Channel. It features really good stories, is well written, has high production values, and a perfect lead in Clint Walker as ""Cheyenne"" Bodie. He is direct, yet kind, physically strong and well built, yet relies on his wits, common sense, and morals. I have been delighted watching the seasons, one by one. Again, good storytelling. There are seven seasons total and each season is terrific. Clint Walker is still with us and even runs his own website even though this series debuted in 1955. I wish him well and hope he is enjoying his fans' interest in his work. I highly recommend purchasing this season and all seven seasons.",1451692800,,731,4.674418604651163

5896299,5,B00E8RVSZC,"Clint Walker is a perfect character of the best moral character.
It's fun to join him in his journeys as he a outsmarts the bad guys and never harms unless necessary.
It's just fun.
I must have seen these fims when they first aired on TV, because they all seem somewhat familiar.",1442275200,,279,4.384615384615385

I bought all (I think) 7 seasons and enjoyed each and every one of them. Clint Walker is one of those actors who never gets ruffled and he plays his part in this series brilliantly. if you are a fan of the old cowboy films, then buy these box sets and sit back and relive a part of your younger days.",1439164800,,427,3.9195402298850577

5896317,5,B00E8RVSZC,"Eastwood is a tough Clint, but Walker is the original.  Clint Walker as Cheyenne is the best of the best.  No western hero is better.  The stories are interesting, and usually have lots of twists/turns/surprises.  The Big Man knows how to take care of business.  We have every season, and continue to watch them over and over, along with the others in the trio:  Bronco and Sugarfoot.",1428883200,2,384,4.656716417910448

The stories are well written and believable. They are different to keep your interest and of course take me back to the good old days of westerns. The baddies are bad but not evil. Cheyenne (Clint Walker) is a good role model for kids.

5896372,5,B00E8RVSZC,"Clint Walker doesn't talk fast or move fast, but he carries himself well in this role.  The shows are consistenly good - unlike some westerns that dropped into self-satire, losing their atmosphere.  Cheyenne Brodie can crack a smile, but you won't find big red shoes and a silly nose in any episode.  My father and I watch westerns all the time, and look forward to the quality of these shows.  Some of the reproductions of other shows have had image or sound issues, but Cheyenne isn't one of them.  You might as well have been transported back and be watching them in real time.",1386806400,,580,4.538461538461538
