8710008,5,B00VG3O98Y,"I have to say I honestly had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch Emancipation. At first I thought it was going to be a dark comedy, but was quickly absorbed in the sometimes dark, although sensitively written, topic and the really fine acting. It's a well-made film on all levels but I most appreciated the acting throughout. Philip Muller-Dorn does an admirable job illuminating a rarely publicized sociological issue with humor, empathy, and especially sensitive direction of a winning cast. There's not a weak link to be found. I highly recommend this very unusual film.",1477958400,,585,4.86
8710009,5,B00VG3O98Y,"eMANcipation examines a serious subject  domestic violence from the unusual point of view of a man being abused by his wife  but is still entertaining to watch.
The movie balances both elements of drama and comedy in a sensitive way. What could be at the expense of authenticity works very well in this case.  Though one can tell that this is an indie-production, the story really got to me, due to the brilliantly written screenplay.
Highlights are the whimsy characters like Holger, the unbelievably annoying (yet so funny to watch) supervisor of the Mnnerhaus, abused Dominik seeks shelter in.
eMANcipation is a movie definitely worth watching!",1435536000,,647,5.084905660377358
