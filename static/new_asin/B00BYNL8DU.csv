5682760,4,B00BYNL8DU,This was probably a good way to go since Family Guy has decline over the last 3 years. The only epsiode I disliked was the season finale. I would recommend this season over Season 10 of Family Guy.,1380499200,4,197,4.2105263157894735
5682761,2,B00BYNL8DU,"Don't let the rating fool you. I love American Dad. However, ever since the sixth season of the show, (2010-2011) it's been really inconsistent. This set just furthers the decline with more mediocre episodes than any other season. The premiere, ""Hot Water"", is fantastic. ""Hurricane"" and ""A Ward Show"" are pretty great too, so the season seemed to be off to a great start, and other season highlights are ""Stanny Tendergrass"", ""Wheels & the Legman"", and ""Dr. Klaustus"". The rest of the episodes aren't really too memorable, with tired plots, uninspired dialogue, and more feces, anti, and dumb humor. Sure, the flashes of brilliance are they and they are aplenty in some episodes, but this batch of episodes is definitely the worst in American Dad's history.

The special features are almost nonexistent. In fact, the entire presentation makes it feel like those Amazon-exclusive DVD-Rs of Cleveland and Bob. Thankfully the video and audio quality is about on par with the last release, but the special features are awful. Sure, there's a quite a few deleted scenes, but they were deleted for a reason. Most of them aren't funny. There are exactly three commentaries, an all-time low for this series, and there's only one commentary worth checking out, the ""Hot Water"" one, as the commentaries on ""Virtual Instanity"" and ""Toy Whorey"" aren't very fun. That may be for my personal preference, but I didn't enjoy those two commentaries. That's basically it, poor episodes, poor special features, etc. etc. Quite a sad release, actually. I have a feeling AD! may just go DVD-R next year with how bad this set was, which is a shame because season 8 was a vast improvement over this.",1380067200,4,1677,4.946808510638298

I don't think this is the best volume of American Dad but there are still some good episodes on here. The season starts off with Stan becoming addicted to a sinister Hot Tub and at the end of the episode he actually dies. Interesting episode, not bad just interesting. The Scarlett Getter features a woman Stan was attracted to before meeting Francine, but it turns out that she is just using Stan because she's an alien hunter who's after Roger. Then there's the annual Christmas episode which in this edition Jeff and Hayley adopt a young child who turns out to be the anti-Christ. There's a handful of other good episodes in here as well. This set is probably for the fans of AD and if you're new to the show I would recommend earlier episodes of the show.",1379376000,16,1238,4.4449339207048455

5682765,5,B00BYNL8DU,The most funny show ever!!! When I first watched this show about 6 years ago I wasn't sure about it but after watching it every night as well the new ones I fell in love. It's no kid show its 100% for adults. Owning these box sets I can watch whenever & picking which episodes I want to watch.

5682777,5,B00BYNL8DU,"This is my favorite adult cartoon, so i didn't mind supporting it, but if it keeps delaying it's seasons. Rick and morty might give it a run for it's money! Also it came with a free American Dad - Season 6 dvd so i was very happy about building up my AD collection. I got tired of having to wait till a specific time (cable) to view it. Big fan of the show, I absolutely love it..
Season 8 is a very witty, hilarious, entertaining & classic part of American Dad! If you're not familiar with it

5682812,5,B00BYNL8DU,American Dad is crazy and Seth Mcfarland has a warped sense of humor. I love it! Volume eight continues to detail the Smith family life and all the crazyness they experience.,1388448000,,174,4.645161290322581

5682818,4,B00BYNL8DU,We have been fans of American Dad for a long time and have all the volumes on DVD. This season held up to the unique sense of humor that is American Dad. However I do feel that show has declined slightly since seasons past. If you are an American Dad fan it is worth purchasing to complete your collection. Even though the show has declined slightly it is still a thousand times better than Family Guy which is so awful and has only gotten more and more ridiculous over the years. I just hope that how this volume of American Dad was isn't a glimps of it following the same path as Family Guy.,1382745600,11,593,4.2105263157894735
5682819,5,B00BYNL8DU,"I love this show SO SO MUCH! It has been my favorite for the past couple of years & I hope it continues airing new episodes for years to come! I've laughed out loud throughout every single episode so far! I never really got into this show back in the day when it first came out, but then I started to watch reruns every night on Adult Swim & then I really got into it. I currently own the first 8 volumes on DVD & plan to buy Vol. 9 when it comes out next year! Family Guy was my favorite show for years, but now it's not very funny anymore. I own the first 5 volumes of Family Guy, but I'm glad I stopped there since it started to become less funny after that & I'm not really into it anymore. This is a much better show than Family Guy & I highly recommend it for all of you Family Guy fans who haven't watched it yet! Don't listen to those people that say this show sucks now. It's still just as great & laugh out loud funny as it has been since Season 1.",1381881600,2,958,3.892857142857143
5682820,5,B00BYNL8DU,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewer about the preference of American Dad over Family Guy regarding the last few DVD releases/seasons
.  I do admit to still eventually buying FG but  the american dad releases are a must have once available.
  There may be some folks that sat ""what's the difference? It""s made by the same folks""  but fans know that it's two totally different shows each with their own flow.  What really amazes me is how they have managed on several episodes throughout the series to produced stories that not only make you laugh but have a strong storyline that pulls you in like a movie..  A great example of that is ""Rapture's Delight"" in season 6.
  All I can say is as long as they keep their formula, I will be buying AD dvds.",1381363200,2,759,4.364285714285714

5682822,2,B00BYNL8DU,"I am disappointed that they left out one of the most hilarious episodes of season 8: ""The Missing Kink"". I was ROFL when Stan discovers his own kinks, accepts his wife Francine's spanking fetish, and ultimately participates in some outrageous kinky sex that puts him in the hospital. Of all the episodes to cut from Season 8, ""The Missing Kink"" is a serious omission that, had I known it was missing, I probably wouldn't have bothered purchasing this mediocre DVD collection.",1381104000,3,475,4.8765432098765435
