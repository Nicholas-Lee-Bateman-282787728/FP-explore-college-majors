This is set in like a gym of a school, or dance class room with windows behind & wood floor. The production is great, good sound, lighting, angles with close ups only when needed & not on girl's stomachs though none are showing too much skin which is also good. The feel of the workout is that they did the entire 30 min w/o any stopping of video or at least tried to which gives a better flow & a good feeling of being there yourself & not taking a break yourself. During the teaching & practicing sections of the routine you'll learn as you go is a semi decent beat ""music"" that is a bit too low in volume, way too slow in speed & is definitely looped after only a min, which got on my nerves & wasn't much better then nothing at all & no music is bad as well.
Jillian leads the intro & introduces them, but admits she can't dance & was taught for a few weeks by a couple of them. It's great she admits this & lets two of the girls demonstrate the new moves as she gives out the verbal cues. She does this well, she actually calls out, ""left foot out, right arm to the side..."" unlike most dance routine videos that only have counting. She always counts to 8 before starting any section or starting from the top which got on my nerves, 3-2-1 is fine enough. Now considering the above, when teaching a new step, if one of the girls doesn't jump into the last move shown fast enough, she practically yells at them, then laughs it off like she's playing. Jillian still lets her ego get in the way & takes away from the great energy of the workout. Kind of like Kathy Smith.
Pros:
production, good cuing of what body parts to move as taught, the great energy of the girls, great talent of the girls, soome of the moves.
Cons:
Jillian's ego, they should teach in slow motion flowing, not fast, stop, fast stop, needs more complex moves or different moves, some were great, others I didn't like at all, more practice more often after a few steps before moving on even then this even though better then other dance routine videos, very looped basic beat music that feels slow so doesn't inspire you to want to dance more.

I'll admit hip hop isn't my favorite & I'm more at ease/natural with latin, hula & belly dancing.
Overall I'd say definitely worth a rental, try online rental, or your library first. The moves aren't THAT hard, definitely easier compared to most hip hop dance routines. The girls are great, I hope they make another one w/o Jillian & with more practice before a new move is taught, more like aerobic PACE w/o watering down the move like aerobics workouts do.

2660038,1,B000ION77G,"Not really that great.  I liked Jillian's other dvd's so I checked this out.  Perhaps it is because I get easily frustrated.  But I would have gotten just as good of a work out putting in some music and dancing around my house.  probably better because I wouldn't have had to try to figure out what they were doing.

important to note - while i enjoy hip-hop i have no hip-hop dance skills whatsoever.",1190851200,2,401,4.364864864864865
2660039,5,B000ION77G,"I loved this video, I happened to be in Wal-Mart and came across this video and I love hip hop, I know it sounds funny coming from a 26 yr old SAHM of 3 kids............LOL, my husband had doubt that I would do it more than once, but the workout is so much fun that I look forward to doing it, I have lost weight and inches and feel great about my self. Thank you Jullian!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1175040000,5,386,4.092105263157895
2660040,4,B000ION77G,"So, this isn't the best workout video ever, but for the price, it's definitely worth it, at least for teens.

To start, the whole DVD is pretty nice because it's broken up into four sections:  Get Real (a body image Q&A between Jillian and six teenage girls), Get Fit (a discussion about nutrition between the same girls), Get Fab (the workout section of the DVD), and Get More (some quick fitness and nutrition tips and a talk between Jillian and Susan Schultz, CosmoGirl! editor).  The three non-workout sections are nice to watch the first time because they do give some good tips and some insight into dealing with the problems that a lot of teen girls do face concerning body image, being healthy, etc.

The important part of this DVD though is the workout.  As the other reviewers stated, it is a cardio hip-hop routine and the moves are taught at a fairly fast pace.  This is because if they were taught and run through any slower, by the third or fourth time of doing this video, one would get incredibly bored with the routine and it would no longer give an efficient workout.  Now, if you have a dance background in hip-hop or even something like jazz, you should be fairly okay.  It's always a little hard to pick up on at first, but the routine is simple, and the more times you do it, the easier it will become.  I did hip-hop/jazz dance for about three years and was able to follow pretty well.  The biggest difficulty to overcome, as with all dance instruction videos, is the fact that the dancers are shown doing the moves opposite of you since you are facing them.  Once again, a dance background will help a lot in picking up on the moves even though this is a slight hinderince.  The workout is a half hour long with about ten minutes for the warm-up.  Make sure you don't skip through the warm-up; it really is essential once you get into doing the dance quickly.  You don't want to throw something out of place.  By the end of the workout I felt like I was getting a pretty good handle on the dance (this is my first time of doing the DVD) and I'd worked up a mild sweat.

In conclusion, this isn't the best fitness DVD in my collection, but it was fun and I felt that it gave me a workout.  I would recommend it for any teen girl, especially dancers, because it actually gives a dance routine that is easy to follow if that is your thing.",1172620800,4,2360,4.363844393592677
2660041,5,B000ION77G,"ITs cheap, and worth it. if you can bear with a long warm up, this is for you. the dances aren't the latest dances; cant really rollup in a club or party doin these but its great exercise.",1171152000,3,188,3.973684210526316
2660042,3,B000ION77G,"The ""Get Fab"" part of the video is a little complicated. They don't show you the moves enough to get used to them. However, after a couple of times doing the workout, it gets alot easier. Overall, it is a good and fun workout.",1168041600,3,226,4.159090909090909
2660043,2,B000ION77G,"On the ""Get Fab"" part of the DVD, the dancers only do the moves twice and expect you to know them. It's a dance, and it's very hard to keep up because it goes very fast. The dances do make you feel a burn, but it's very hard to keep up with them.",1167868800,3,246,3.660377358490566
2660084,1,B000ION77G,"This is definately geared toward a much ""younger"" group.  I was lost after 5 seconds.  It's very hip-hop - teen type dvd.  I gave it to my daughter - she likes it.",1324425600,2,163,4.03125
2660085,5,B000ION77G,"Jillian you got my 14 yr daughter attention she got this in the mail and she put it on before school and did the whole workout. there isnt' many dvd out there for kids or teens. We haven't watch the talking parts of the dvd yet. But I was happy that she like the hip hop. We have many of your dvds just pick up the one that came out Dec 6, 2011. I have to keep a list on my cell phone of all the jillian, bob and biggest loser dvds so I know which ones I have and which one I dont' when I see one that I don't have I get them. I actually bought 5 dvds the 2 biggest loser dvds, bob and your's of course Jillian. Getting a collection that is for sure. Variety is key!

Thanks Jillian for making a video for our teens. I watch I was like there is no way I could do the hip hop I wasn't even going to attempt doing it.",1323216000,4,815,3.7109826589595376
2660086,1,B000ION77G,"I consider myself a decent hip hop dancer, but this video is extremely too difficult if you are not an experienced hip hop dancer. I was thrown off the entire video. It was a waste of money and will be returning it since I bought it at a CD Exchange. I wouldn't recommend it for over weight teens with little to no dancing skills. The video will just frustrate you and make you give up!

2660087,4,B000ION77G,"This was a fun workout that makes you forget that you are excersising. And that's important for me since I'm not a fan of traditional workouts at all. You get to learn a cool dance routine that could be taken to the clubs as easily too. I do have to say that it is a bit challenging to learn. It takes several times watching the video to get it down. But that's why you have a pause and back up button on your remote. The extras on the DVD bring up some valid points that effect many women, not just teens. My only complaints are the looping music that gets pretty tedious and boring after awhile even if it does have a good beat. Also Jillian can get on your nerves with some of her mannerisms sometimes. I think she tries to fit in with the teens more than acting like the 32 year old woman that she is.",1293753600,,805,4.069182389937107

2660089,5,B000ION77G,This is a great dvd for teenagers. I loved how Jillian sat down and talked to a bunch of teenagers and problems that we face. I really related to what they had to say. I really enjoyed watching it and I did not want it to end.,1221004800,,226,3.8297872340425534

2660091,3,B000ION77G,"Starring Jillian Michaels of Biggest Loser fame-- and aimed towards teenagers-- ""CosmoGirl! - Get Fit and Fab"" is a cardio workout vid in which viewers are taught to dance in a hip hop style.

On the whole, I liked the casual, laid back, and fun atmosphere of the video; it felt less like an exercise video than a dance class. I also liked the fact that it was teaching you a genuine choreographed routine, as opposed to some videos that are really just aerobics moves with some dance moves thrown in.

In spite of its strengths, I found a few problems that knocked it down from a 5 star to a 3. First problem: learning curve. Like I said, the cardio workout teaches you a fully choreagraphed routine. It does this by going through it step by step. First, you're introduced a move in half time, then asked to practice it 2 or 3 times at actual speed. That's all well and good, but sometimes some of the more complicated dance moves are rushed through before you have a chance to really get them. As a result, there's a steep learning curve on this video. You might have to view it at least 3-4 times before getting your footing and even then it might be another 2 viewings before you can actually keep pace with anyone and have it all memorized down pat.

Another problem was the pacing and intensity of the workout. Basically, when you're taught the routine, you're not just performing each new move at least 3 times; every so often you're restarting the routine ""from the top""-- and you're doing all of this without a single break. Then right after you're taught all the moves, you're immediately asked to perform the routine from start to finish for something like 4 times in a row. As if that wasn't bad enough, the pacing of it all is extremely fast. Between the lack of breaks and fast pacing, you'll be sweating profusely and gasping for air halfway through the video.

One last problem I had with this video was the ""exuberance"" of the dancers. Many times Michaels would have you practice a new move from the position of the one you'd just learnt. Unfortunately, whenever she'd count down sometimes some of the girls would start showboating, strutting, and vamping for the camera instead of positioning themselves. This made learning the routine confusing at times. After all, it's very hard to remember what position to start from when practicing a new move, if all the dancers aren't taking up that position to begin with because they're too busy ogling the camera.

So all in all, this video was a mixed bag for me. On one hand, it offers a genuine dance routine with the right kind of atmosphere to motivate and inspire. On the other hand, it has a steep learning curve, can be confusing at times, and a little bit too physically challenging. I wouldn't totally pass on it, though. My suggestion is to rent this video first and if you like it enough to buy it, to keep that pause button ready when things get too intense.",1213747200,5,2933,4.536862003780718
2660092,3,B000ION77G,"I love Jillian Michaels and hip hop, so I thought this would be a good combo. I haven't watched the entire dvd, but it's only because you need to learn the moves over and over, and I haven't taken the time to do that. For a teen just starting to exercise and needing a moral boost, this would be good for them. (Saving for my little girl when she gets older.)",1208649600,,359,4.070422535211268
2660093,2,B000ION77G,"I purchased this video as part of a combo, so I wasn't really aware of it's target audience. I found out very quickly that I wasn't part of that audience. It is most definitely targeted towards young teenagers and the discussions are very narrow in focus because of the immaturity of the participants. I'm sure it is quite good for girls of that age who have yet to realize that their life can be mucher deeper than they believe.",1203206400,,429,4.443037974683544

8146841,1,B000ION77G,"This video is horrible, don't waste your cash. I thought I'd change it up and buy a JM video - I like her flashcards and have always thought she was pretty good - but this is not for a beginner.

After skipping through the body image / eating healthy parts (2/3 of the DVD) I finally got to the work out part. A full ten minutes was spent gently stretching, where you're walked carefully through each move and time is spent to ensure you're comfortable with the motion and then... WHAM! You're suddenly a hip-hop star! Now you watch as they demonstrate a series of four fairly complex (definitely tough for a beginner!) moves and then with barely a second wasted, you're on to the next four. It was actually comical. At several points JM mentions having spent a week learning from these hip-hop dancers and that she's only just getting it. I can believe it!! The workout part is not the issue, it's the fact that you have to be a frigging DWTS champ to get those moves and string them all together.
