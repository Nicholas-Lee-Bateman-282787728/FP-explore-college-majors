3517799,4,B001CT05JE,"It's a typical story about a guy searching for his brother on a ""road trip"". There are girls involved, and as usual, there's trouble attached.
The script is nothing special but Lou Taylor Pucci makes the movie. Sure it's low budget and you won't be wowed by any special effects. But the roller coaster ride here is your attachment to the protagonist and wanting to know how his plight unfolds. Not an ""E"" ticket but a ride worth taking.",1292630400,,436,4.531645569620253
3517800,3,B001CT05JE,"First of all, I thought the acting for this movie was pretty good from all the actors, especially Zooey Deschanel.  Too bad she wasn't in it more!  Mercer decides on a whim to steal a car and track down his older half brother (who he hasn't seen in 15 years or so).  He starts his journey the last place he knew his brother was at and keeps getting sent somewhere else.  The stolen car's owner continues to call Mercer and they form an emotional relationship through the phone.
By the middle I was wanting a resolution but it kept dragging on.  Parts of the movie are just so unbelievable it was hard to watch.  if you are a big fan of Deschanel or Malones, I'd say rent it.  Otherwise I'd skip this one.",1244073600,8,704,4.2481203007518795
3517801,4,B001CT05JE,"2007's under the radar independent film The Go-Getter tells the story of a somewhat feeble and mundane Mercer(Lou taylor Pucci) who's decided to take a road trip in order to find his brother and convince him to help spread their deceased mother's ashes. With almost nothing to his name, Mercer steals a car; that is owned by the lovely Kate(Zooey Deschanel) and begins trekking across the U.S., finding loophole after loophole.

Yes, it is similar to the typical plot of an independent film, about a coming of age experience but it is more enjoyable then most, and the acting by the young cast is enjoyable. Not to mention some of the crazy characters we come to meet and quickly find a distaste for.

The cinematography is brilliant, all the scenery was just near flawless; with gorgeous colors and whimsical feelings.

Although the film itself is fantastic, the true star is the soundtrack, mostly by M Ward, it is surreal, calming and the perfect companion to the enjoyable movie.",1242172800,8,983,4.839285714285714
3517802,2,B001CT05JE,"""The Go-Getter"" was not the movie its Trailer suggested.  There was a consistent story and competent acting, but parts seemed contrived and unrealistic.  After a while watching, both of us yawned and wondered how much longer the movie was.  If you are killing time, maybe a good item, but the pace was slow, no real drama nor adventure.  Could be titled ""Pacing Through Life After Stealing a Car"".  Not a recommended buy.",1242086400,6,421,4.791666666666667

3517805,5,B001CT05JE,I began watching this on On Demand over the summer and fell in love with the oddity of it all. I love Zooey Deschanel (as a rule) and this movie is no different! I suggest this more for people into independent films.,1384128000,,216,4.166666666666667
3517806,1,B001CT05JE,"Yes, she has a cute voice, which you get to hear regularly throughout the movie. But there is no better window on a chaotic, pathetic life as this one. One of the worst movies, plotless and pathetic.",1376438400,,199,4.405405405405405
3517807,5,B001CT05JE,"Unpredictably and sensitively told with fantastic acting all around.  There are a million ways to film a road trip and this is definitely a new one.  A shy 19 year old looks for his estranged half brother and deals with the psychological baggage of two very different girls along the way.  If you like a light quirky coming of age story that never telegraphs where it is about to go next, this one is about as good as they come.",1373241600,,428,4.325
3517808,4,B001CT05JE,"Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, one of only three film reviewers that I really listen too, says it best on the cover: ""Emotionally truthful, painfully funny and vibrantly alive."" Yep. Never heard of Lou Taylor Pucci before, but expect to see him more after this. Solid. Jenna Malone continues to be one of our best young actors. And I haven't seen Zooey Deschanel do anything I haven't loved. Nick Offerman, who I've become a big fan of, is excellent. A Sundance Official Selection. An independent with real heart. I only found out about it by chance reading an article. So glad I did.",1372464000,,585,4.689320388349515
3517809,5,B001CT05JE,"The casting for this story is flawless, the soundtrack (the reason i wanted to watch in the first place) synchronizes beautifully. Would like to see what other films Hynes has directed.",1369785600,,185,5.0

absolutely LOVE it.

3517811,3,B001CT05JE,"This is another Jena Malone movie that she turns in a truly unique and wonderful performance ,not her best,due more to the film itself,as she always makes the hair on your arms stand on end with her acting. The film could use a bit more help than what Jena could do. The actors du the best they can with what they have to work with! It is a very strange and tough to follow movie that you have to kinda see a few times in order to catch up to what is happening and it is a bit un nerving at times,it is a good resume for the perfonances by these very good actors however,the film itself can make you want it to end!!",1339804800,,616,3.975806451612903
3517812,3,B001CT05JE,"I want to support indy films. We need someone to balance out the Hollywood behemoth. But I look at this flick and wonder if it isn't just a Hollywood movie posing as an indy movie.

Here's the scoop. Mercer (Lou Taylor Pucci) steals a car to go find his half brother and tell him their mother has died. The car's owner (Zooey Deschanel) is in touch with him via her cell phone, which was left in the car, and they carry on a conversation as he traverses the West, Southwest and Mexico to find brother and deliver the news.

This IS a road movie, replete with odd characters, circumstances, trouble and soul searching. But it just seemed to be stuff I've seen too many times in other movies. The cast, as good as they were, were pretty high powered to inhabit an independent film. Zooey Deschanel, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jena Malone and Bill Duke must have chewed up a sizable portion of the budget. They did appear to use natural sets and a lot of hand held camera so my guess is there was some money saved there. But, again, it all seemed too familiar. Even the soundtrack, with all kinds of indy bands doing insightful-ish songs seemed calculated. Some of the scenes gave me the impression of being odd for odd's sake. You could almost feel the wheels turning in the writer's head.

This isn't a bad watch though I did feel myself getting antsy after a bit. I just got the feeling they were trying too hard to be too indy. It's like a cult movie. You can't set out to make a cult movie. It either turns out to be one or not. The audience decides that for you.",1336348800,,1556,4.321917808219178
3517813,5,B001CT05JE,"I never thought i'd be writing one of these reviews, but after watching the Go Getter last night it would be a crime not to tell you how wonderful this film is. This is without a doubt the most beautifully shot film i've ever seen in my life. You can get a feel for it if you watch the trailer, but you have to watch the film to actually experience how the director used colors and lighting in the most incredible way. This is easily my favorite film with Zooey Deschanel in it. (Yes, i liked it more than 500 days of summer, if you could believe that.) And the soundtrack done by M. Ward works perfectly for the film. Its a shame that more people won't be able to watch this film or are listening to the completely bogus negative reviews. If you're a fan of independent films or just enjoy watching an amazing, touching film, you cannot miss this one. Trust me.",1315526400,3,862,4.262195121951219
8289101,5,B001CT05JE,"This movie is indie, sincere and full of adorable interactions in very beautiful places. The cinematography and soundtrack alone are worth the watch to me, but you add in one of the best performances by Zooey Deschanel and you got a solid video experience.",1519344000,,256,4.840909090909091
8289102,4,B001CT05JE,"When a teenager's mother dies, his road trip in a stolen car to reunite with his long lost brother unexpectedly becomes a fun roller-coaster of self-discovery. He steals a car to go see his older brother who he has not seen in 10 years. The cavalcade of crazies he meets along the way is comical and Lou Taylor Pucci is amazing as is Zooey Deschanel. This was such a sweet story that tugs at your heart strings because you want this kid to have the very best of life and you know it isn't going to happen. Check it out and you will love it.",1489190400,,540,4.152380952380953
8289103,4,B001CT05JE,"Man I loved this movie!!  Okay first off its a little biased review because I had a small part in this movie.  Part of it was filmed at my hometown in Oregon.  I bought this movie knowing it was a low budget film, but I had high hopes for it.  This movie surprised me for being independent and ended up liking it a lot.",1484092800,,319,3.9375

8289108,4,B001CT05JE,"First of all, it's probably only fair to mention that I'm hugely biased when it comes to any film brilliant enough to cast Lou Taylor Pucci. He has the impressive ability to shift like a chameleon, taking on an amazing range of physical characteristics yet never losing sight of the subtle humanity behind each role. I also think Zooey Deschanel is enormously appealing, so seeing this movie became a foregone conclusion the moment I realized it starred both of them together. And it's such an enjoyable, heartfelt, thought-provoking trip. Like any roadtrip movie about self-discovery, this one contains more than its share of brief encounters (some quirky, some meditative) that allow the protagonist to grow. But where many movies of this sort slide into overbaked cliche, this one retains a great deal of heart thanks to the winning, winsome chemistry between its two leads -- which is really saying something, considering they don't even meet face-to-face until multiple miles in. The movie is also quite inventive in its use of framing devices (one sequence shows a succession of women's faces speaking in Deschanel's voice, as the protagonist tries to picture what she might look like). Another plus is that the photography is gorgeous, and the musical score is an evocative counterpoint to many of the scenes. Evan Rachel Wood is on hand to spice up an early leg of the journey, and we meet an amusing assortment of characters throughout -- three of which, interestingly, are played for subtle and not-so-subtle laughs by Nick Offerman. But in the end, I found myself actively rooting for Pucci's character, Mercer, to find a safe and sympathetic soulmate after losing so much. Sweet, touching, spirited and uplifting.",1427673600,,1725,5.077464788732394
