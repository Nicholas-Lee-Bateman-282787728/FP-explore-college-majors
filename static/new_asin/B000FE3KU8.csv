2562017,2,B000FE3KU8,"I'd waited for several years for this movie to be put onto DVD, as it rarely shows up on cable. I saw a variety of reviews here on Amazon, so I took a chance. Oops!! While sound was fine, as some of the other reviewers have commented the video qualuity as pretty poor. If someone produces a quality copy I'd puchase again, but if you are a fan of this movie stay away from this version until something better comes along.",1328054400,,421,4.209876543209877
2562018,1,B000FE3KU8,"This is a cheapie and bad copy of an excellent film. Avoid this one. As another reviewer noted, there's a UK set of restored Fields films that I own and highly recommend. The label is Universal so no cheapie rip-off. Unfortunately, US copyright often gets in the way of even a studio releasing their own films. Getting the UK set is reason enough to look into a region-free DVD deck, one of the best buys I've made. My Pioneer cost no more than a US-only deck but lets me play DVDs from all over the world. Go to ""amazon.co.uk"", find the Fields set, and get a region-free played from Amazon. You won't regret it!",1314057600,5,612,4.37719298245614
2562019,3,B000FE3KU8,"A classic W.C. Fields with great skits, but the quality disappointed me greatly-looks like a bad VHS tape was transferred.  My other CD's from this company were very good quality though.  Too bad because it was ""Mississippi"" that I wanted the most.  I would have rated it 2.5 if I had the option-just for picture quality.",1312675200,2,321,4.696428571428571
2562020,1,B000FE3KU8,"The disk sent to me by Northwest Traders skipped very badly, and it was very disturbing, especially in the many musical numbers.  Northwest was nice about sending me another copy, but it was defective exactly like the first.  Also, closed captioning was not available; no extras whatsoever, and this is not a cheap product.",1311724800,,323,4.962962962962963
2562021,4,B000FE3KU8,"When you consider how old this movie is, digital restoration can only go so far.  Having said that, this is great movie and the quality is surprisingly outstanding.  Enjoy old movies.  W. C. Fields is a riot in this one and Der Bingo his usual pleasant self.  Joan Bennett is one classy lady.  Buy it!",1301011200,2,301,4.4
2562022,2,B000FE3KU8,Might as well spend the extra money for the Bing Crosby set - it has to be better quality than this; very disappointing !,1291939200,3,121,4.083333333333333
2562023,3,B000FE3KU8,"Like others, I purchased this DVD-R, together with ""If I Had a Million"" and ""Tillie & Gus"". A week ago I was thumbing through some UK sites (AmazonUK) and discovered Universal has released a 17 movie box set of WC Fields.
Included are the 10 already released in the 2 Fields Box sets, plus ""Six of a Kind"", ""Big Broadcast of 1938"" AND RESTORED COPIES OF ""Million Dollar Legs"", ""Follow the Boys"", ""Mississippi"", ""If I Had a Million"" and ""Tillie and Gus"". Had been selling for 60-odd English Pounds, I bought it for @ $50 AU (about $45 American dollars). I'm stoked!!! Now, there's only ""Mrs Wiggs"", ""Her Majesty Love"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Songs of the Open Road"" and ""Sensations of 1945"" to go. (Fields' bits in ""Tales of Manhattan"" is already out on a Fox DVD).",1252368000,8,765,4.591240875912408
2562024,5,B000FE3KU8,"The Fact that it has W.C. Fields in it is Good Enough!
This is a forgotten movie that should be shown on TCM.
People tend to forget about comedians such as Fields.
W.C. had other little Gems of Films that deserve to be
seen Again!",1232150400,5,230,4.133333333333334
2562025,3,B000FE3KU8,"First off, it's a DVD-R, region 0, it's not a manufacturer's DVD, zero extra's, reasonably cheap CD case photo.  My rating of 3 star is due to this alone and not the quality of the movie or transfer which are both very good.

That being said and out of the way I'm happy as a clam to see a good transfer of Mississippi on DVD finally. I have a copy I made off digital cable a few years back with an S-VHS tape recorder and although that copy is very good, this DVD is much better. Not sure what their source material was but the picture is very clear, sound is very good too. Pausing the opening titles shows no artifacts around the titles edges which a low quality copy will always have.

Moving on to the movie itself, this is a rarely seen Fields movie that is very, very good. Bing Crosby takes some of the stage away from W.C., but W.C.'s  parts are great. His story about ""carving his way through a wall of human flesh"" and the resulting fainting woman is classic Field's. This DVD seller also has Field's Tille & Gus and If I Had A Million on DVD.

Hopefully Universal or whoever has the rights to the official release of the yet to be released to DVD Field's movies will get Mississippi, Tillie and Gus, Million Dollar Legs, & Her Majesty Love all out soon on a third Field's collection as well as the following bit part Field's movies: Tales Of Manhattan, Alice In Wonderland (1933), Song Of The Open Road, Mrs. Wiggs Of The Cabbage Patch, Sensations Of 1945, Follow The Boys as well as the silents The Old Army Game, Running Wild & Sally Of The Sawdust(uncut please, I have it uncut on tape it should be 124 minutes, NOT 113,110, or 92 minutes as most tapes/DVD's are).

Overall another great Field's movie that I heartily recommend for your viewing pleasure.",1199491200,36,1769,4.378048780487805
2562026,4,B000FE3KU8,"I LOVE this movie, it's nice to see Bing crooning, and Fields is in top form, the classic story he tells of himself ""carving his way through a wall of human flesh"" is a real riot. Too many times folks get caught up in analyzing a film and fail to take it in for what it offers in pure, simple viewing pleasure. This film needs no in depth analysis, no stuffy analytic viewing. Sit down, watch and enjoy it for what it is, great entertainment that never gets caught up in taking itself too seriously.

NOW...hello Universal...PLEASE issue a vol. 3 WC Fields collection and include this in it. While this VHS version is good, a DVD done up right would be fantastic!",1174608000,2,663,4.390243902439025
2562027,4,B000FE3KU8,"Entertaining 1935 musical-comedy with W.C. Fields in splendid form. Co-star Bing Crosby demanded that Paramount re-edit ""Mississippi"" in his favor, but the Great Man steals the show. Plenty of classic Fieldsian routines and Der Bingle croons a few memorable tunes. Breezy direction by the reliable A. Edward Sutherland. 100 Proof Dialogue: ""Never been frightened of liquor in all my life.""",1425513600,2,389,5.5
2562028,5,B000FE3KU8,"nostalgic I'll say, lovely film for the older, the kids who started swanee river especially the little girl really touched me,
it took me back to when I was 15, when it was a tanner to go into the dress circle at the local cinema
a bit corny story line but I loved it",1408665600,,267,3.962962962962963
2562029,5,B000FE3KU8,I thought this movie was never going to come out on DVD. I have it on VHS and tried to get it transferred to DVD with no luck. I just about gave-up on it and finally here it is. If you are a W.C. Fields or Bing Crosby fan you will like this movie.,1392681600,,247,3.5925925925925926
2562030,5,B000FE3KU8,"I had a VHS copy of this which was okay, the usual old movie with areas of fuzzy images and fuzzy sound. I have slowly been replacing my VHS movies with DVD versions because I can't seem to keep a VHS player longer than a year before it breaks down. And no one around here works on them because ""it's cheaper to buy a new one"". When I found this movie in DVD I hoped it would be a better version than just a VHS recorded directly onto a disc. It turned out to be a much better version and I'm so happy I bought it! Clearer images and sound than the VHS copy I have. I love the old movies and they are slowly disappearing so thank you for putting this on DVD! Now I need to take the old VHS tapes and crochet a rug or a tote bag or something out of them like I do grocery bags.",1389398400,,776,3.8260869565217392
2562031,5,B000FE3KU8,What can I say other than I have been a fan of W.C.Fields for over 50 years. I only hope all of his other movies will be available some time on DVD.,1386374400,,148,3.65625
2562032,5,B000FE3KU8,"This funny movie was made when Fields was at the top,  and his performance show's why he was/is one of the funniest men in the world.",1380672000,,133,4.115384615384615
2562033,4,B000FE3KU8,"This classic musical from the 1930's is fun to have on DVD and it is a very good print. W.C.Fields steals the movie and his card game is a classic. It's old, it's dated, but these great old movies are a joy to own and enjoy.",1379980800,,224,3.891304347826087
2562034,3,B000FE3KU8,continue to add to the collection for my husband. w.c.fields is old breed of vaudville comedy and my husband enjoys this kind of humor!!,1365379200,,136,4.708333333333333
2562035,5,B000FE3KU8,"One of our favorite movies.  We are so glad to own it on DVD!
If you are a W.C.Fields fan I highly recommend it!",1357084800,,112,3.6666666666666665
2562036,2,B000FE3KU8,"This looks like a bad transfer from an old VHS, or maybe a Beta tape. What gives it away: the grey fuzzy band at the bottom that you can't get rid of, the feeling you're seeing double or riding in a bumpy car, and - most of all - the TCM logo (Turner Classic Movies) that occassionally flashes on the screen. Is this borrowing or stealing? I don't know why this movie isn't available on a ""real"" DVD because it's one of my favorites, with W. C. Fields at his best along with great early Crosby singing. Why isn't it shown on TV? All I can think of is black stereotyping, which is pretty mild.",1356825600,2,592,4.156521739130435
8121351,5,B000FE3KU8,A great W.C.Fields movie!  Bought it more for that than for Bing Crosby.,1486339200,,72,4.538461538461538
8121352,1,B000FE3KU8,Have ordered two of these and they won't work on our DVD player. The Ad says DVD but what arrives is something that states DVD with the letter R under the icon,1482364800,,159,4.0

8121357,5,B000FE3KU8,"I recorded ""Mississippi"" on a VHS tape twenty-some years ago and as far as I know, it has not been available on DVD until now.  There is a good story well told and the transfer to DVD was very good.  People these days only know W.C. Fields from a few posters, but his performance goes a long way toward justifying what some have called him: the funniest man who ever lived.",1447372800,,373,4.23943661971831
8121358,5,B000FE3KU8,W c fields continues to be one of the funniest men ever and this DVD did not disappoint!!!!!!!!,1446681600,,95,4.333333333333333
8121359,5,B000FE3KU8,"I was a little skeptical at first since this isn't a professional studio release, but rather a DVD-R burn by an independent.  Well, it's obvious that they know their stuff because the print used was excellent and whatever cleanup they did made it better.

The five stars is mostly for the value on this disc.  The movie would have gotten that many regardless.  Of course, I'm more of a Fields fan than a Crosby fan, so whenever the old crooner would start belting out a tune, I'd get impatient and say ""get back to the riverboat captain!""  I'm sure Crosby fans would have the opposite reaction.",1443398400,,594,4.566037735849057
8121360,5,B000FE3KU8,This 1935 W.C. Fields Classic features a great performance by a very young Bing Crosby. It has all the elements of a Bill Fields film and if your a fan of this comic genius you'll surely love this DVD.,1428624000,,201,4.17948717948718
