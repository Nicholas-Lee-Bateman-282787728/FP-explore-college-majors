8316152,3,B0002OXV0U,"Volume 1 of Platinum's ""Comedy Classics"" series is perhaps more deserving of the title than Volume 2 in the series, with two Harold Lloyd classics, a Wheeler and Woolsey vehicle and Roland Young and Joan Blondell in the third Topper film.

Topper Returns is a predictable entry in the Topper series, but is charmingly acted by the likes of Joan Blondell, Roland Young and Billie Burke.  Possibly not a comedy classic, but definitely a stellar cast.

Hook, Line and Sinker has the zingy one-liners and zany characters typical of a Wheeler and Woolsey picture.  Bert Wheeler plays the elder member of a pair of confidence men, and Robert Woolsey the junior member who falls in love with a hotel heiress played by Dorothy Lee.

The Milky Way is definitely a ""comedy classic,"" and one of Harold Lloyd's best talking pictures.  So successful was the tale of milkman-turned-fighter Burleigh Sullivan that Danny Kaye remade the film a decade later as The Kid from Brooklyn, changing little.

The Sin of Harold Diddlebock was Harold Lloyd's last of 200+ films, released in 1947.  In it Lloyd manages to overcome the acting-with-animals curse by outshining 37 lions (including the famous ""Jackie""), 14 tigers, 9 jaguars and 1 puma.  Definitely a film worth looking at.",1127174400,,1259,4.957142857142857
