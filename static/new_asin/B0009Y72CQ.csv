8070235,5,B0009Y72CQ,"The Cosby Show... an all-time favorite TV series for many years across the world. This show ran from 1984 to 1992, and is still loved by many. Although now the classic episodes can be seen in syndication, meaning that 1-2 minutes are usually cut out due to time constraints. This DVD features 6 episodes in their ORIGINAL, UN-EDITED formats! Including their original opening and closing sequences, as well as the original brief trailor shown during the commercial break.

VIDEO

The video is clear, not too soft or sharp. Each episode has 4 chapters (Opening, Act I, Act II, Closing); with the acception of ""Denise gets a 'D'"", which has 5 chapters.

AUDIO

The audio quality is very good. No hissing, not too quiet or too loud.

COVER

The cover for this case features a big picture of Bill Cosby, and smaller pictures of the cast in the background. The main color for this DVD case is light blue, and the logo is written in brownish-white. On the inside of the case is the list of episodes and a brief description of the episode, as well as another shot of Bill Cosby. The back of the case features the credits and copyright of each episode.

What I don't understand is the dates written for when the episodes first aired. I have several volumes of this collector's DVD set, and many of them say the same dates:

- October 13, 1988

- December 8, 1988

- February 6, 1989

- February 20, 1992

- March 16, 1989

- December 14, 1989

These dates are obviously wrong. The episodes on this particular volume are all copyrighted in 1986. You can also tell by the opening sequences. To see the TRUE year each episode aired, look at the copyright year, or watch the end credits of each episode.

MENU

The main menu features the same shot of Bill Cosby as seen on the cover, and the same group picture of the family. In the background, you can see a later cast photo (with Geoffrey Owens and Erica Alexander). This makes no sense, considering that they are in none of these episodes, and most of the episodes for the entire Collector's Edition set have episodes from the first 5 seasons.

The season 3 opening theme song is played in the background. This makes sense for this volume, since 5/6 episodes are from season 3. However, some of the other volumes have no episodes from season 3 and still use the theme song.

The options to choose are ""PLAY ALL"", which is simple: play 1 episode, then the next.

""EPISODE SELECTION"" brings you into a new menu with each episode listed, and you can choose the one you want. IT will automatically start you at the beginning of that episode.

""CAST INFO"" is a special feature on this set. This particular DVD volume features information about Erica Alexander.

""NOTES AND TRIVIA"" is another special feature. It tells some little facts about the show that a long-time watcher of the show may know.

EPISODES-

""Off To the Race"" - This is the only season 2 episode on this DVD. It features the ORIGINAL season 2 opening, that is rarely seen in syndication. (The one seen in syndication is shorter and a symphesiser plays the music, not a saxaphone.) This episode was made in 1986.

""Mother, May I?"" - This episode is a season 3 episode. It, and all the other episodes on this DVD, feature the extended season 3 opening (The one seen in syndication is cut shorter). During the making of this episode, Phylicia Rashad was pregnant, and they tried to hide it (but you still can tell). This episode was made in 1986.

""The March"" - This episode is a season 3 episode. This was the last time Clair's parents (Joe Williams/Ethel Ayler) are seen until 1992. This episode was made in 1986.

""Theo's Flight"" - This episode is a season 3 episode. This is the first time Kenny, or ""Bud"" is seen. It was made in 1986.

""Denise Get's a 'D'"" - This episode is a season 3 episode. At the beginning of this episode, Bill Cosby talks about the dangers of drugs. This episode has 5 chapters, so you can skip ahead of Bill Cosby's announcement to the opening credits. This episode was made in 1986.

""War Stories"" - This episode is a season 3 episode. It has many war stories, one taken from ""The Good War"". (See the end credits). This episode was made in 1986.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

Overall, I really like this DVD, as well as the other volumes of the set. It is a good way to bring The Cosby Show's original episodes back to your TV without having to watch the syndicated versions on TBS or Nick@Nite, or wait for another season set to be released. On a scale of 10, I would give this DVD a 10. Order your copy now! You'll love it!",1128297600,4,4548,4.4709443099273605
