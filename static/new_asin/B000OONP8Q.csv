8185867,5,B000OONP8Q,"Ever since Gonzales ditched his baby-pink burlesque routine and started tickling the ivories, there's been no real doubting his talent - with his 'Solo Piano' being one of our best-selling records of all time and the kind of heartfelt gem that seems increasingly rare these days. Comprised of delicate piano pieces, the melodic threads that permeated the record made it an utterly addictive and sublime treat which can lay claim to the slew of ivory music that followed in its wake. Taking this album as its starting point 'From Major To Minor' is Gonzales' first DVD and isn't currently available! Overflowing with ideas, extras and friable creativity, 'From Major To Minor' opens through the fantastic 'Gonzales Masterclass' - a live show recorded in Paris that sees the man himself giving what is strictly speaking a demonstration-drenched lecture on playing the piano. Now whilst we realize that may sound a little dry, Gonzales prevents any dip into Open University territory through some wonderful touches and a dusting of special guests - meaning one minute we are being shown why certain keys sound appealing to the human ear, whilst the next Daft Punk are on stage bouncing rubber balls whilst Gonzales hammers out 'Da Funk' on the piano. Trust us here; it's brilliant. Next up is 'White Gloves', a straight up concert film that allows Gonzales to fully showcase his key-tickling skills alongside some caustic appearances from Feist, Jamie Lidell and Mocky. Clocking in at accumulated running time of nearly two hours, these features alone would be enough for most people - but not here, with the ethereal 'Pianovision' seeing Gonzales performing live at a classical piano festival in France alongside some stunning piano-projections from Ninja Pleasure, whilst 'The Piano Battle' gives a nod to his hip-hop past through a face-off with classical improviser Jean-Francois Zygel - wherein piano are pushed to breaking point through some melodious aggression. Elsewhere there are bonus features galore, including an Israeli TV appearance, the ""legendary"" Berlin press conference to announce his musical retirement, an organ-concert instillation, plus a ruck of videos including the award winning 'Take Me To Broadway'. Intelligent without becoming highbrow, mischievous without becoming puerile and most importantly straining with gorgeous music and visuals, this is a serious contender for DVD release of the year. Enjoy.",1421366400,,2429,5.361256544502618
8185868,5,B000OONP8Q,"I never really got into Gonazales first CD that much. I heard it, thought it was kinda cool, but then forgot all about it.

Then one day I heard about the solo piano CD, and downloaded it right away. It was so beautiful - so beautiful, in fact, that I almost immediately ordered the import version of it.

It's like a set of Satie or Debussy tracks. A perfect chill-out CD if you like gorgeous solo piano. My fiancee and I once listened to it while laying on our backs looking up at the blue sky over Central Park in NYC... such a lovely memory.

This DVD is really pretty great. There are many funny bits, several lessons on composition and melody - all with a great humerous tongue-in-cheek humor that is unmistakably Gonzales. It's not pretentious - it just shows that this guy knows his stuff and is probably a step ahead of the rest of us.

One scene during a concert right when he goes to play what is my favorite piano track from the CD all the lights on stage go out and a single spotlight illuminates an audience member - seemingly chosen at random. It's unlike anything I have ever seen in a live concert and it comes off beautifully.

First, buy the SOLO PIANO CD. Then, if you love that, buy this companion DVD. You will not be disappointed.",1194134400,3,1253,4.337606837606837
