8221373,2,B000W6Q1RS,We never made it past the first episode; it was boring. Nowhere near as funny as Corner Gas.,1435449600,,92,4.166666666666667
8221374,5,B000W6Q1RS,"This is a great as season one. All the characters, especially the gay couple are hoot to watch.  Their strange neighbor with a hair problem, can cause more humor then true friendship.",1395964800,,183,4.71875
8221375,5,B000W6Q1RS,"The second season of Robson Arms is also very funny. The action centers on the odd mix of tenants in this old apartment building. Gabrielle Miller is a delight as Bobbi. Other cast from season two include Alisen Down, John Cassini, April Telek, Laura Bertram, Peter DeLuise & Leslie Nielsen just to name a few. I've enjoyed watching all three seasons.",1341446400,,351,4.770491803278689
8221376,5,B000W6Q1RS,"Knew of some of the actors in this series from their work in Corner Gas.  Found the episodes in this series delightful.  Will order other DVD""s from this series.",1294531200,,161,4.517241379310345
8221377,4,B000W6Q1RS,"Season Two feeds the viewer's addiction to Robson Arms Season One.  This is a remarkably clever series which, sadly, ends after Season Three.

Most of the same loons from Season One are carried over into Season Two, but some new faces are introduced into this Vancouver apartment house setting with its microcosm of idiosyncratic personalities.

The same salty language and thematic frankness that appeared in Season One re-occurs in Season Two, but somehow it's not offensive, just honest.  It's not a show for children, largely because most of it will be over their heads.

I found Season One to be extremely humorous; however, the smile factor of Season Two is not quite as high.  Having said that, the viewer needs to watch Season Two in order to progress to Season Three which is right back to the top of its game.

After watching this series I got on the computer to see if there is anything more forthcoming from Robson Arms.  Alas, after Season Three, there's not.  I'm bereft.",1253923200,,985,4.781065088757397

After the first season, I though I'd give it a try but wish I hadn't -- too sexual and TOO depressing -- and I didn't see the humor at all.",1237852800,,334,7.564102564102564
8221379,5,B000W6Q1RS,This show is really fun to watch. Each episode deals with different tenants so you can get a feel for everyone who lives in the building. Definatly worth buying.,1232323200,,161,4.586206896551724
8221380,5,B000W6Q1RS,"This is a great premise for a tv show. This show could have gone on for years with different characters coming and going. It is a shame that several of the actors,writers,producers left to make Corner Gas,leaving this show to die after two seasons. Is it worth getting?Yes(atleast its two seasons, and not a one season wonder)Does it suck that it ended too soon?Yes,but now you get to watch Corner Gas...",1220832000,,404,4.704225352112676
8221381,4,B000W6Q1RS,"As with season one, we get to go behind the closed doors of the tenants of The Robson Arms in Vanouver, BC. The show is very funny, and helps fill my void of all things Canada here south of the border. Each week focuses on a different tenant and their story and laughter ensues. If you want to check out something a little different than the norm, check it out. This season gets stronger as it goes along. If you want to sit back and laugh, pick up this DVD.",1220400000,,458,4.1
