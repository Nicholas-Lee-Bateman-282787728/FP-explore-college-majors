8169234,1,B000MGTEHM,Very slow.  Too much talking.  Not enough exercising.  Geared toward very old people.  I'm 68 years old and I thought it was lame.,1436659200,,130,4.521739130434782
8169235,5,B000MGTEHM,"I have suffered back pain for years and it is like a selfish child that constantly wants your attention. But the only difference between a selfish child and back pain is a selfish child cries and has tantrums whereas back pain is constant stabbing pain. This best way to overcome back pain is to understand it and learn to control it. Dr. Paul Lam's Tai Chi for Back Pain - DVD is an excellent tool to start with in conjunction with your healthcare professional. After reading several books on back pain, exercises, and martial arts training, the Tai Chi for Back Pain - DVD gave me a tool that is effective and my healthcare professional approves of. The key to success is daily practice and perseverance.",1392249600,5,706,4.611111111111111

8169237,4,B000MGTEHM,"This is a good, gentle exercise for back pain sufferers and those who want to avoid back pain in the future.",1365552000,3,108,4.190476190476191
8169238,5,B000MGTEHM,"Please excuse the young dumb girl in another review, she knows not what she speaks. This dvd is for people of any age with serious back pain, not the occasional 'waah my back hurts'. Those people can take a tylenol and call someone who cares. If you are in the pain club, you know who you are and this dvd can help you. Unfortunately the video is obviously produced on a limited budget and if you've had no previous experience with Tai Chi, you may find it a little confusing. Just remember to breathe.",1365120000,9,502,4.351063829787234
8169239,5,B000MGTEHM,"This video is easy to follow and really does relieve back pain. For those with limited mobility, it even details how to do the exercises sitting down. After hip surgery and the loss of part of my leg, I was happy to find this. I built up the strength in my leg and eased the pain in my back.",1232409600,9,291,3.9491525423728815
8169240,2,B000MGTEHM,"I am 29 yrs old and I have recurring back pain.  I bought this hoping to find a method of exercise that would be safe for my back.  Well, it's safe alright, but not so sure it's ""exercise"" for me.  The setting of the video appears to be shot in a gym, bland, not appealing.  And the class behind the instructor is full of about 6 elderly people and maybe 2 middle-aged people.  I found it both hysterically funny and depressing that I was basically doing exercises with a nursing home!  The quality of the exercises were very slow-moving, several done while sitting in a chair, and because of the distraction of all the old people standing in front of me, I found it distracting and could not relax.  In summary, if you are older, this would be perfect for you (I actually want to give it to my grandmother), but if you are younger like me, I don't recommend it.  The instructor was very helpful though, it's a shame that the rest of the video was so distracting to me, and that it wasn't a bit more challenging.  By the way, I believe a lot of the work he was doing in the beginning was more Qi Gong rather than Tai Chi.",1202428800,6,1121,4.225352112676056
