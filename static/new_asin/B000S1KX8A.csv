2878607,5,B000S1KX8A,"Film about Moliere, his life and description of the creative process for one of Moliere's best known work.  This wonderful biography mixes comedy, drama and literature all in one.  We learn about beauty of French language, art of acting and lives of French upper class in 17th century.  This is not an every day comedy where you will be laughing out loud.  It is subtle and that is the beauty of it.  The costumes and textiles in this film are breathtaking.  Colors are rich all around: in the theatre, gardens, interior of the upper class homes.  This film will put you at the time and place for artist who wanted to reach outside of the world of comedy.  Romain Duris who has role of Moliere in this film is pure virtuoso in his delivery of this performance.  Must see foreign film of the year.",1201478400,2,796,4.472222222222222
2878608,5,B000S1KX8A,"Molire is the cinematic equivalent of a banquet of rich French delicacies. Every aspect of this film is exquisite - from the writing and directing to the sets and costumes. The cast is amazing.

This is a fanciful biography of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, a.k.a. Molire, the 17th century French playwright.  History tells us that a very young Molire was tossed into debtor's prison when his theater troupe went bankrupt. After his release from prison Molire disappeared for a period of time. After he reappeared he spent 13 years touring, practicing his craft and making his name throughout the provinces of France before he conquered Paris. The film deals with the period of Molire's disappearance. It takes the stance that the people he met and the adventures he had during this time were the inspiration for some of the most famous comedic plays in Western literature. Much of the action presented in the film combines characters, situations and devices taken directly from Molire's works, notably `Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme' and `Tartuffe.'

On the farcical side, our Molire has been freed from debtor's prison by Monsieur Jourdain who wants Molire to teach him to act in order that he may romantically impress a certain young widowed Marquise with a one act play he has written in her honor.  Jourdain needs Molire in his home, but he can't reveal the true reason to his wife.  So Molire is disguised as Tartuffe, a priest who will serve as tutor to the youngest Jourdain daughter.  Jourdain's plans for seduction also depend on the assistance of his confidante, the impoverished nobleman, Dorante.  Meanwhile, Molire/Tartuffe is developing a romantic interest in Jourdain's wife, Elmire. A pair of young lovers, Jourdain's daughter and her music teacher further complicate the action.

The story is modern, stylish and sexy, with comic and tragic elements that will charm you and hold your interest.  You don't have to be a fan of 17th century French theater to appreciate it. However, if you're familiar with the plays, this movie will have more meaning as the dialog is packed with quotes from Molire's work.

The DVD comes with a highly informative and entertaining commentary (in English) by director, Laurent Tirard. A ""Making of...."" feature is included, but doesn't add much to the package.

The film was mastered in HD. It's visually perfect.

In French with English or Spanish subtitles. Highly recommended!",1201305600,57,2416,5.0886075949367084
2878609,5,B000S1KX8A,"I found this film to be quite refreshing and beautifully done. Granted, there are several scenes in which the plot seems to slow down; however, I was impressed at how beautifully the acting was done. The comedy in the film was funny and clever; and anyone, especially those who truly appreciate literature and Moliere's work can find joy in watching this film. If you enjoyed ""Shakespeare in Love,"" I would highly suggest this.
The end catches you by surprise, and the music is outstanding!! This film is not too difficult to understand for Americans, and the subtitles are in perfect size. All in all, this movie is quite a masterpiece; and I recommend it highly!!",1198454400,3,665,4.791304347826087
2878610,3,B000S1KX8A,"Jean-Baptiste Poquelin known all over the world as Moliere, the great if not the greatest satirist and patriarch of the farce, was a man whose theatre came from life, and whose life was theatre. His life was in itself one big amazing soap opera of the 17th Century and his writings,most notably ""Le Misanthrope"" and ""Tartuffe"",were reflections of what he had experienced in life.

How then can such a colorful and larger-than-life literary figure be reduced to a film where nearly still-life shots lull the viewer into a state of boredom and weariness for two hours? This is all made  possible courtesy of Laurent Tirard's romantic Period Piece MOLIERE! No other film had I anticipated more this Summer than this fanciful and sumptuous telling of the young Moliere and what was conjectured to be his inspiration for his great works to come......I FELL ASLEEP!!! When I awoke, I pieced together what I had missed,left the theatre, got a cup of Starbucks, then went back a second time,paid my $9.50, sat down and settled in to be totally surprised and wooed by this sophisticated production about the world's foremost comedic writer.....I made it through this time....but barely! WHY? Posed scenes with virtually no movement fail to capture a viewer's attention and hold it. MOLIERE is like standing in front of art gallery paintings that speak! Though this film is capturing the time in which Moliere is only twenty-two years of age and has yet to reach his peak of fame, no excuse can be made for such dry-as-dust cinematography and actor blocking which make the most ardent moviegoer, much less a lover of Moliere himself,squirm uncomfortably in their seats as if they were watching the entire Ken Burns' CIVIL WAR in one sitting!

The script,which overflows with references to Moliere's plays, is really not the biggest problem with this film at all. Moliere has been thrown into debtor's prison. His only way out is to teach a buffoon-like merchant and aspiring author named Jourdain to win over a young beauty. Moliere, disguised as a priest named Tartuffe,ends up falling in love with Jourdin's wife,Elmire. There are usual Molieresque subplots also, but the entire script does not generate enough inertia and the farce falls pretty flat.

Frankly, the acting is admirable also (as much as it is allowed to be!).But unless you are fully awake,(and even then there is no guarantee!),be prepared to be lulled and cooed even if you don't want to be! MOLIERE stars Romain Duris as the young writer. Duris is given far more acting latitude in the recent DANS PARIS.Fabrice Luchini, as the nobleman who hires Moliere to instruct him in the art of wooing, fares much better. Laura Morante performs admirably as Jourdin's wife; but again,this film just does not ignite enough passion or comedy to recommend more than one viewing.

The English subtitles are large,white and extremely readable.

All-in-all,MOLIERE is a major disappointment....2.5-3 stars.

A much better film containing info on the life of Moliere would be MARQUISE starring Sophie Marceau. There is an excellent dvd/vhs series entitled MOLIERE, but unless you taped it off of PBS with its English subtitles, it exists only in the French.",1188691200,3,3201,5.016949152542373
2878611,4,B000S1KX8A,"This summer of movies has featured two historical romances in which two famous writers become who they are.  The first movie, ""Becoming Jane"" is based upon the life of Jane Austen and shows her discovering her themes as a novelist as a result of a failed romance.  The other movie, ""Moliere"" was released 2006 in France but was only recently released with English subtitles in the United States.  I found it much more inspiring and entertaining than its counterpart.

The story takes place at two times in Moliere's life: when he is on the verge of his artistic sucess upon being called to the court and thirteen years earlier when, as the leader of a wandering group of comedians, he is thrown into a debtor's prision.  The plot becomes elegantly tangled.  Moliere is rescued from prison by a nameless French nobleman who wants his assistance in producing a play to seduce a beautiful, fickle young coquette.  He is brought into the house in the guise of a priest named ""Tartuffe"" and immediately arouses the suspicion of the nobleman's wife.  The wife becomes attracted to the much younger Moliere when she chances upon some writing he has done for her husband, and, yes, the two begin an affair.  Meanwhile Moliere rescuses his rescuer from a conniving neighbor who takes his money, has designs upon his son as a wife for his daughter, and tries to foist his own attentions on the lovely coquette.  Moliere's cleverness thwarts these attempts, while Moliere also seeks forgiveness for cuckolding his benefactor.  The benefactor shows a great deal of character development from an fop and a seducer to one who realizes the error of his ways.

But the highlight of the plot is they way the experience, and his relationship with the Countess, influences Moliere.  Throughout the movie, Moliere is portrayed as a frustrated tragedian who longs to do great things but fears they cannot be accomplished through comedy.  The Countess twice forcefully tells him to persevere through all vicissitudes in his calling as a playright -- and to stick with his genius for comedy.  When Moliere says that comedy cannot be meaningful, she tells him to invent comedy that can.  The point is brought home convincingly.

The manners, set, and acting in this film are beautiful and the subtitles are easy to read.  I thought this movie an excellent period piece about the great French writer of comic drama with an inspiring moral for the viewer.

2878612,4,B000S1KX8A,"No question looking for muses to bail you out of a creative crisis is a tough dollar. Just ask the Greeks who started the whole business. That search can pretty well sum up the struggle of the 17th century French comedic playwright known as Moliere in this fictionalized French language film of the same name under review. For those in the know, those who have seen or read anything by the comedic master Moliere some of the scenes and themes in this film will seem vaguely familiar (vaguely here by this reviewer since it has been a long time since I have seen or read his plays), especially around the ideas of the cuckolded husband, the pretentious aspiring bourgeois, the perfidious aristocrat, and the errant wife.

Heres the skinny on this very easy to watch patchwork of themes from Molieres plays and fragments of his life. Moliere (played by dashing Romain Duris) like a lot of creative people was stuck in a rut, his rut being playing and writing farces and comedies for the masses out in the villages of France when what he wanted was to go into serious theater, wanted to write that one great tragedy that he knew he had in him after being on the road for a long while. But everything runs against him and his capacity to do such work, from the expectation of his royal patrons to his muse, the wife of a grand bourgeois, Elmire (played by Laura Morante).

The grand bourgeois, Jourdain (played by Fabrice Luchini), who had employed him on a secret mission to woo an aristocratic woman he is obsessed with had gotten more than he bargained for in two ways. First the aristocrat Dorante (played by Edward Baer), penniless and cunning, who was supposed to grease his path to his obsession had played him for a fool as he finds out through Molieres good offices. Secondly, Moliere under the name Tartuffe (from one of his plays), using cover as a tutor for his younger daughter had a whirlwind love affair with his wife, the fetching Elmire. She, the muse he must obey, tells him as they part that he must become the greatest comedic playwright of the day. He must follow what he was born to do, make people laugh.

That parting was the price that Moliere had to pay to insure Elmires happiness once Jourdain found out Moliere and Elmire were having an affair. He, in revenge, threatened an unhappy marriage of his elder daughter to Dorantes son if he did not break off the affair. All of this story was told in a flashback after Moliere found out that Elmire was dying some thirteen years later. Get this though, On her deathbed Elmire insisted that Moliere use her death, a tragic event, in a comedic effort to show just how great a playwright he was. He balked at first but you know what happens if you don't follow your muse. Yeah, just ask the Greeks. Watch this very fine two hour period piece.",1470441600,,2809,4.536489151873767
2878613,4,B000S1KX8A,"While I would not class this movie as a comedy, it is extremely entertaining and full of period costume and architecture. Elements of tragedy flow from Moliere's personality even though he is called upon to do comedy and apparently was well received in the area of farce. The figure of Jourdain is more of a pitiful fool and Moliere's sudden sacrifice of a devoted lover to save Jourdain's daughter from a bad marriage seems self-destructive and a bit out of character. The weakness of the movie seems to be the failure to expose sufficient motivation for the characters' choices and actions.",1465776000,,592,4.871287128712871

I bought it for my own personal collection simply to have access to it when the mood strikes to watch it when I wish.

2878667,5,B000S1KX8A,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for costume dramas set in this period. The costumes and sets ARE gorgeous, but they absolutely take second place to the story and acting. I hadn't realized the movie was French and that I'd be reading English subtitles, but it turned out not to matter - I had no problem following along. I was also unfamiliar with Moliere's story or his plays, again it didn't matter, although I'm sure someone who IS familiar with his plays would enjoy the references. What made the movie work for me was the writing and acting. Moliere's character came alive through Romain Duris - his frustrations, doubts, his areas of confidence, his unexpected love for Elmire. Not only is Romain Duris quite a pleasure to the eyes, but his acting is superb. In fact, all the actors in this film did an excellent job, especially Fabrice Luchine as Jourdain, a role which could easily have become a cliche, but certainly did not in this film. The story is particularly interesting in its look at the actor's life, how he must consider so many things when playing a role comedically or tragically, and how often comedy is used to explore tragedy. This is one of those films which is so much better than it had to be (and those are all too rare). I highly recommend it for Moliere fans, for costume drama fans, for those who are fascinated by the theatre, and for anyone who enjoys laughter through tears.",1389744000,2,1415,4.596837944664031

2878697,5,B000S1KX8A,"Easier said than done, of course. The beautiful Madame Elmire Jourdain provides a tragic curtain call, foreshadowed in the first scenes of ""Molire"", but most of the film is pure Comedie Franaise farce, and at times a farce within a farce, on the model of both Shakespeare and ""Shakespeare in Love."" And the farce is funny, consistently funny; the script is clever, the actors are generously skilled at physical comedy, and the director knows a great deal about comic timing. Add the attraction of gorgeous visuals and crafty camera-work, and you have a 'balmy night's entertainment.' Don't be fool enough to ask for more than that.

This is not a filmed rendition of a stage play by Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622-1673), known as Molire. There are elements of Tartuffe and of The Bourgeois Gentleman in the script, but the narrative is a fictional account of the young playwright discovering his true vocation of comedy amid a ludicrous double seduction. French theater of the 17th C was still solidly built on the Italian models of the commedia dell'arte -- Punch and Judy, if you will -- and this modern comedy revives the spirit of Baroque theater without becoming any sort of museum piece. The only flaw in the production, to my mind, is the goopy 'Hollywood' musical score. With such luscious sets and costumes of the highest authenticity, a score of equally luscious music by Lully would have given me raptures.

It's in French, of course, with well-done subtitles in English and Spanish. A lot more enjoyable, I'd say, than ""Die Hard XIX"" or ""Harry Potter and the Scrofulous Columbarium"".",1263168000,5,1593,4.940298507462686

2878699,5,B000S1KX8A,"Readers:  Please be aware that I intended to rate ""Moliere"" as four stars.  It is difficult to change the rating on a review here on Amazon once it is posted.  Otherwise, the review stands as written. Robin Friedman

The 2007 summer of movies featured two historical romances in which two famous writers become who they are. The first movie, ""Becoming Jane"" is based upon the life of Jane Austen and shows her discovering her themes as a novelist as a result of a failed romance. The other movie, ""Moliere"" was released 2006 in France but was only recently released with English subtitles in the United States in 2007. It was released as a DVD in 2008.

The story takes place at two times in Moliere's life: when he is on the verge of his artistic sucess upon being called to the court and thirteen years earlier when, as the leader of a wandering group of comedians, he is thrown into a debtor's prision. The plot becomes elegantly tangled. Moliere is rescued from prison by a nameless French nobleman who wants his assistance in producing a play to seduce a beautiful, fickle young coquette. He is brought into the house in the guise of a priest named ""Tartuffe"" and immediately arouses the suspicion of the nobleman's wife. The wife becomes attracted to the much younger Moliere when she chances upon some writing he has done for her husband, and, yes, the two begin an affair. Meanwhile Moliere rescuses his rescuer from a conniving neighbor who takes his money, has designs upon his son as a wife for his daughter, and tries to foist his own attentions on the lovely coquette. Moliere's cleverness thwarts these attempts, while Moliere also seeks forgiveness for cuckolding his benefactor. The benefactor shows a great deal of character development from an fop and a seducer to one who realizes the error of his ways.

But the highlight of the plot is they way the experience, and his relationship with the Countess, influences Moliere. Throughout the movie, Moliere is portrayed as a frustrated tragedian who longs to do great things but fears they cannot be accomplished through comedy. The Countess twice forcefully tells him to persevere through all vicissitudes in his calling as a playright -- and to stick with his genius for comedy. When Moliere says that comedy cannot be meaningful, she tells him to invent comedy that can. The point is brought home convincingly.

The manners, set, and acting in this film are beautiful and the subtitles are easy to read. I thought this movie an excellent period piece about the great French writer of comic drama with an inspiring moral for the viewer.

Robin Friedman",1262217600,,2619,4.804444444444444
2878700,3,B000S1KX8A,"This movie follows almost exactly the template created by ""Shakespeare in Love."" We meet a young playwright, Moliere, trying to figure out his gift and find the proper way to express his genius. He is hired by a pompous rich gentleman to teach him how to approach a haughty young widow. Moliere himself is presented as a rather greasy, scraggly young man who spends much of the movie disguised as a priest. Moliere falls in love with his employer's comely but neglected wife. Many complications ensue and the movie ends with Moliere pulling the story together to write his first great masterpiece, ""Tartuffe.""

It would help a lot if viewers of this movie were familiar with the play Tartuffe. I suppose much of the French audience undoubtedly would have been and most of the American audience, including me, undoubtedly would not be. The movie evidently includes many classic lines from the play (again in the style of ""Shakespeare in Love"" where the play in question was ""Romeo and Juliet."") Even without that background knowledge, the movie provides an entertaining romp without ever trying to go very deep into analyzing the true source of Moliere's greatness.",1261353600,2,1164,4.969230769230769

2878705,5,B000S1KX8A,"It's fitting that Moli&egrave;re is buried in Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise, alongside such poets and artists as Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Bizet, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Isadora Duncan, St&eacute;phane Grappelli, Amedeo Modigliani, Jim Morrison, Yves Montand, &Eacute;dith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gioacchino Rossini, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Oscar Wilde. At the time of his death actors by law were not allowed to be buried in the sacred ground of a cemetary, but Moli&egrave;re's widow begged the king, and he was buried in the part of the cemetery reserved for unbaptized infants. In 1817 his remains were transferred to Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise, close to the burial plot of La Fontaine.

The 2007 film, Moli&egrave;re, is based loosely on his life; think Shakespeare in Love--or maybe more like Moli&egrave;re in Love. In it the young actor/playwright Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (nom de plume, Moli&egrave;re) is sprung from debtor's prison to tutor Jourdain, a merchant, in the ways of stagecraft so that he might impress the lovely C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne (Ludivine Sagnier). To keep his wife Elmire (Laura Morante) from getting suspicious of his intended affair Jourdain has him masquerade as a priest, Tartuffe, who is ostensibly there to tutor his daughter. Hijinks ensue, no doubt the raw material Moli&egrave;re would later incorporate into his play, Tartuffe ou l'Imposteur, with more great stuff left over for Le Bourgeois gentilhomme, and lines and situations from the film show up in many of his other plays. If you are not familiar with his work, you can still enjoy the movie--it serves as a great introduction to his oeuvre. If you are familiar with them, all the better.

Romain Duris does a fantastic job portraying Jean-Baptiste Poquelin. He is an actor who never intended to be one, but was just spotted in a crowd and offered the opportunity and he hasn't looked back since. I remember him from 2005's De battre mon coeur s'est arrt&eacute;, aka The Beat That My Heart Skipped, where he played thug/Real Estate Agent/pianist Thomas Seyr. He is good at juggling complex personalities--i.e. sensitive thugs.

Fabrice Luchini is also very good as le bourgeois gentilhomme M. Jourdain. Laura Morante plays his lovely wife Elmire Jourdain well. She inspires the young playwright as he tries to seduce her, and by inspires, I mean she inspires him to reach higher in his writing, to invent a new kind of comedy that incorporates tragic elements as well.

Edouard Baer also stood out as the titled Dorante, and some of the exchanges between him and Jourdain provided superb comic moments.

Last but not least Ludivine Sagnier was stunning as C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne. She can be seen if not heard in the 2003 film Peter Pan as Tink, or seen and heard in many fabulous French films such as 2002's 8 Femmes.

C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne: What angel sent you to make us laugh like this? We're so dreadfully starved for entertainment.

The French followed in the footsteps of the movie Shakespeare in Love to come up with a delightfully funny movie about what could have happened to Moliere during the two years of his professional life about which nothing is known.  He spent a short time in jail for unpaid debts of his theatre troupe, dropped off the radar for a couple of years and then transformed theatre of the 17th century, later influencing such genuises as Oscar Wilde.  This movie is a silly, but brillant stab at what could have led to his comedic masterpieces, especially Tartuffe.",1238025600,,652,4.701754385964913

The film is entirely in French, with English subtitle option.  The story fictionally depicts what could have happened to Moliere during a short period of time early in his career.  The story involves events which were supposedly the basis for his famous comedies.

He represents this part of the universal history when some countries in Europe decide to improve their national lenguages. Shakespeare in Elizabeth's England, Moliere in France and of course Cervantes in Spain.

Today nobody can doubt about the fame of Shakespeare or Cervantes... But apparently the french writer came late in reafirming the importance of the french lenguage.

The movie remind me in moments the awarded movie ""Shakespeare in Love"". Similar topics: ambition to be known and respected by the society, love and romance; and of course you need to include comedy.

It's a good movie and a good way to try to rescue the french lenguage.",1210809600,,721,4.9421487603305785

As I watched the movie, I was thrilled to see how the producers came with an idea of what Moliere did during a 2 year period that is not documented in any of the historical references of the period. There is humor, there is love and there is definite passion in this movie. It mixes the most remarkable materpieces of Moliere. It is a movie to treasure for all of those who like me admire Moliere and his humourous wit!",1208217600,5,566,4.201834862385321
2878714,5,B000S1KX8A,"This film delivers in every possible way.  Like Moliere's farces this film is richly layered with meaning, beautifully edited and just simply satisfying.  The humor as befitting the subject is often poignant and all the more effective because of the emotional content.  The acting is flawless, the score soaring, and it is beautiful to behold as well.  The romance has an element of realism that is breathtaking and inspiring.  A must see!!",1207958400,5,440,5.055555555555555
2878715,4,B000S1KX8A,"What a wonderful film!  What better way to explain the wit and humor and humanity of a play by Moliere than to put the playwright in one of his own productions, as it were.  The actors are fantastic; it's as if they are inspired by the ghost of Moliere to give these glorious performances.  One must also mention the gorgeous sets and clothes--ooh la la!  Even the ""Making Of"" featurette is fun; whether consciously or not Director Laurent Tirard recreates the comraderie of Moliere's troupe 300+ years later.  I want to say this film is a jewel but it's actually too vibrant, too touching to be called that.  Not just one of the best French films in recent memory but it's one of my fave films from any country in years.  Merci beaucoup!",1207785600,5,738,4.503759398496241
2878716,4,B000S1KX8A,"In case you were wondering it is not official and there is now a sub-genre of historical fiction films that we will call ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00001U0E1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>.""  These are films in which case we learn that (gasp!) the life of a famous author parallels one of their most famous works.  For Wm. Shakespeare it was a mixture of ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night.""  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becoming-Jane/dp/B000ZIZ0RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becoming Jane</a>"" purports to find the real Mr. Darcy in the life of Jane Austen.  Here, despite a title suggesting that this is a look at the entire life of the celebrated French playwright, we discover that ""Tartuffe,"" arguably the best of the comedies of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (the artist known as Molire), was based on a personal tragedy.  This, of course, echoes the whole ""laugh clown even though your heart is breaking"" idea personified by Canio's ""Vesti la giubba"" aria from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pagliacci/dp/B000003EOH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pagliacci</a>,"" which is clearly a key element of this particular sub-genre.  I bring all of this up because if I had not seen the other films cited above, then I might have a higher estimation of ""Molire.""  Instead, I am wondering if there will be similar films made about the attendant ironies between creators and creations for the likes of Sophocles, Henrik Ibsen, or anybody else that comes to mind down to Stephen King.  Just imagine the existentialist trauma of ""Samuel Beckett in Love.""

""Molire"" begins in 1658, when the playwright and actor, played by Romain Duris, returns to Paris from touring France with his company of players.  He has been given a theater by the King and instead of doing one of the farces for which he has become well known, Molire aspires to write something better.  Then a young woman shows up and requests that he accompany her to the deathbed of her mother.  We then go back a dozen years when Molire troupe is so bankrupt that he is thrown into prison (but not after getting a lot of laughs from his audience).  Molire's is saved by the wealthy Monsieur Jourdain (Fabrice Luchini), who likes to hire experts to help with his various needs and who requires a playwright to help him rehearse a play he has written to seduce the beautiful widow Climne (Ludivine Sagnier).  The fact that Jourdain is married to Elmire (Laura Morante) requires the playwright to do so incognito.  Hence he presents himself to the rest of Jourdain's family as a priest named...Tartuffe.

As was the case with ""Shakespeare in Love,"" where the more you remembered about ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Twelfth Night,"" the more you could appreciate what was happening in the story, the same applies here with regards to Molire's ""Tartuffe ou l'Imposteur"" (""Tartuffe or the Hypocrite"").  For example, the name Tartuffe is not the only one to be recognized from the play and provides your first major clue as to who the playwright's love interest will be in the film.  Those who are familiar with Molire's work will also see echoes of scenes from both ""Le Misanthrope"" (""The Misanthrope""), and ""Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme"" (""The Bourgeois Gentleman"").  This is not to say that this 2007 film does not work unless you know your Molire, but rather to say that there are levels to these film only accessible to those few person.

Director Laurent Tirard (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Story-Of-My-Life-Mensonges-et-trahisons-et-plus-si-affinites/dp/B0009A2BJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Story Of My Life / Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinites</a>""), who co-wrote the screenplay with Grgoire Vigneron, is basically trying to turn the unknown part of Molire's life into one of the playwright's comedy of manners.  The trick, of course, is for the cast to act this out in a much more realistic manner than we would see watching a Molire play performed on stage.  Consequently the proceeding are relatively sedate and despite the inherent irony of the situation, not as comic as a Molire comedy.  However, that is necessary to set up the final scenes of the film, both in the past and the ""present,"" where things take a more serious turn.  I actually liked the ending(s), considerably more than the set up.  Duris' best moments are the few where his character gets to show his comic genius on stage, but it is Luchini who turns in the film's best performance as Jourdain.  Since the film is in French with subtitles, that probably increases the odds that those on this side of the Pond who decide to check it out will do so because these like Molire's plays and will appreciate all the nods and winks ot his work.  But those who are starting to overdose on these authors in love movies might not want to bother with another one.",1204243200,4,4990,5.339719029374201
2878717,3,B000S1KX8A,"Director/Writer Laurent Tirard and co-writer Grgoire Vigneron have wisely decided to make this film about a short period of Moliere's (a can this actor do no wrong, Romain Duris?) life rather than attempt to make a survey film about Moliere's entire life. As such this ""Moliere"" sketches in the mysterious lost years of Jean Baptiste Poquelin's life and mostly to good advantage.
Physically ""Moliere"" is an absolutely sumptuous affair: all plush velvet and silks, shot in remarkably gorgeous saturated color. Also on the plus side is the performance of Romain Duris (""The Beat that My Heart Skipped"") as Moliere as well as the Elmire Jourdain (wife of M. Jourdain who has hired Moliere to teach him the fine points of acting and seduction so that he can seduce another woman) of the perpetually sexy and sultry Laura Morente whose revealing bodice causes her husband untold consternation.
Duris plays Moliere in the grand style: artificial, over-the-top as if he were in a Moliere farce. In most movies this would be completely out of place but here it works as the writers have incorporated pieces of several Moliere plays herein and Duris merely goes with the proverbial flow. His Moliere is at turns confident, sure of himself and at others completely at odds with the world and flummoxed by pretty much everything. Duris's Moliere is a fine tuned performance: a completely controlled one full of absurdity and irony yet always human and thoughtful.
""Moliere"" goes on a bit too long and Tirard's attempt to make this a Moliere farce at times falls flat but nonetheless this is a good film with better performances and without a doubt a feast for the eyes if not always for the ears.",1203206400,26,1685,4.895104895104895
2878718,3,B000S1KX8A,"This flawed but pleasant film relates imaginary events from the life of the playwright Moliere.  It is a whimsical fantasy along the lines of Shakespeare in Love although it's hardly fair to compare the two.  Shakespeare in Love benefits from 1) better, more familiar characters, 2) a better more suspenseful story augmented by the deft touch of Tom Stoppard, and 3) packs a whole lot more star power to boot.  Moliere although visually pleasant, is somewhat plodding and overlong, and about as exciting as a drive through the French countryside.  You won't need your blood pressure medicine for this one because there's no drama here.  The characters and their problems were never real enough to compel me to care, nor was the humor funny enough to make me laugh.  But for some strange reason I still enjoyed this harmless little movie.  It might be there's a closet Francophile in me, it might be that movies based upon the lives of real famous people are always at least a little interesting, but probably I was just in the right mood for a slow drive in the country, or it's cinematic equivalent: Moliere.",1201996800,5,1109,4.774869109947644
2878719,4,B000S1KX8A,"`Molire' is delightful.  Yes, the man, the French playwright, who has given us great farcical gems, but the movie, too.  Whimsical, playful, and every bit endearing, `Molire ' draws from two historically missing years in the famous man's life and does fanciful conjecture much the way '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B000065KB3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>' did for the great Bard of Stratford.

In the ""Special Features"" portion, director and co-writer, Laurent Tirard, explains that they indeed fill in the blanks for his missing life by having the playwright meet the people who later will become characters in his plays.

At first we see the man starchily serious.  He tries to sell tragedies to an acting troupe who more objectively know their best suit.  The king offers his patronage, but is as wise as his actors for insisting he stick to farces.  On tour, people throw food at the writer, who is acting in one of his own plays, trying to play it straight.  It is only when a performance is interrupted by the police that Moliere comes to his senses.  Confronted about his debt, he makes sport of the police, earning his first laughs and cheers of the evening.

In a way he garners his ""out of jail free"" card.  For a wealthy patron, Mssr. Jourdain (Fabrice Lucini)  has seen his performance and sees his potential.  He gives Moliere an offer he can't refuse:  He'll support him and get him out of prison, but Moliere must perform a play he has written for his beloved wife.  He's loathe to the idea until Jourdain threatens to put him back in debtors' prison.  Yet, his biggest challenge is trying to stay hidden from his wife, so she will be surprised.

It doesn't take long for Moliere to be discovered by Caroline Jourdain, but he rises to the occasion by hiding under an assumed name, ""Tartuffe,"" and sports false pretenses as a religious zealot, sought for the family's spiritual guidance.  (`Tartuffe' is the only Moliere play I've seen although I've read another.)

From here it seems ever more like Shakespeare's own `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Comedy-of-Errors-Signet-Classics/dp/0451528395/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Comedy of Errors (Signet Classics)</a>' as romantic entanglements ensue and ripen, and people's motives for love and money are eventually sorted out. Maybe not of the same caliber, but much ado about something along those plot lines.

Not since the spirited '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casanova/dp/B000EDWKXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casanova</a>' has a film been so fun and handsomely decorated.  'Moliere' is a beautiful French film that is substantive enough to relish for its laughs as well as for its inspiring connections to Moliere's plays.

2878720,4,B000S1KX8A,"I haven't enjoyed a comedy so much in a long time. The acting of Romain Duris (Moliere), Laura Morante (Madame Jourdain), Fabrice Luchini (Monsieur Jourdain), and Edouard Baer (Dorante) outweigh some of the unevenness of the script.  Laura Morante gives a wonderful performance, combining sensuality, comedic charm, elegance, and tragicomedy.  Romain Duris' portrayal of Moliere is delightful, ranging from slapstick comic to bereaved lover.  The movie is a treat -- replete with humorous scenes, romantic intrigue, lovely scenery, and heartbreak. Strong 4 stars.",1201564800,2,563,5.759036144578313
2878721,4,B000S1KX8A,"'Molire' is a treat for the eyes as well as a tickler for historical manipulation and in the hands of writers Laurent Tirard and Grgoire Vigneron the cinematic version of the 'lost years' of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin AKA Molire's life abounds in superb entertainment.  If the story becomes a bit too convoluted at times, trying to paste together a story that parallels the French playwright's most famous plays, `Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme' and `Tartuffe' as the basis for the missing portion of Molire's life, and drags on a bit too long at two hours, it is never less that gorgeous to look at and witty to hear.

Jean-Baptiste Poquelin or Molire (Romain Duris) is an actor and playwright for a comedy troupe that tours the provinces of France, spending himself into debtor's prison. His mysterious disappearance from prison is the time this film uses to explain how Molire was enticed by the wealthy M. Jourdain (Fabrice Luchini) to travel to his estate for the purpose of teaching the dilettante  how to write plays and to act in order to win the affection of a wealthy young Climne (Ludivine Sagnier) while keeping his daughter and his wife Elmire (Laura Morante) at bay. There are many subplots that tend to distract but in the end the 'play' created by Molire's presence and interaction with all of the other characters provides the life lessons and food for material that leads Molire to be the greatest of French playwrights.

The cast is superb, the visual effects are opulent, the musical score  is period correct, and the cinematography finds a fine balance between the lush vistas of the countryside and estates and the grimy realism of the prison and small theaters.  Perhaps the story is not historically correct, but no one really knows the true events in the missing portion of Molire's life, and this version is at least plausible and thought provoking.
