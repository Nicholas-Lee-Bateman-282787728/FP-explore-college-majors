8302143,5,B001FME00S,"This is a classic from when I was growing up. Brings back good memories of a time when I was close to my parents and siblings; a time when TV was more educational, better drama, a good reason to spend family time watching great stories like this one.",1374537600,,250,4.229166666666667
8302144,5,B001FME00S,My wife had seen this movie as a child approximately 30 years ago.  She always mentioned it and we asked for the film at different stores.  I had given up trying to find about five years ago.  Now that I am shopping for movies online it is easier.  The film had a tremendous impact on us. Especially my grandkids. They will never have prejudice and indifference to people that are different in general,1369353600,,401,4.4520547945205475
8302145,5,B001FME00S,I have been looking for this film to give my mother for Mother's Day and I could not be happier to have been able to find and at a great price. I did not think it would arrive on time for Mother's Day but it arrived a day before which gave me enough time to prepare the entire gift. The seller was prompt and I had no problems at all. The film arrived carefully packaged and in amazing condition. Thank you for making Mother's Day awesome:),1368489600,,440,4.127906976744186
8302146,1,B001FME00S,"I was very disapointed with this movie.  Manuel Ochoa Lopez is a very good.  I have seen him in many other movies and love his acting; but in this movie, although he was very good the story line and most of the other actors were very poor.  Boring.  The review states that this movie was as good as the previous movie with Pedro Infante- - - NOT True; at least in the previous film the music was very good, and the actors made you feel their heartbreak.  The Father, Grandmother, and the priest were very believable, a real tearjerker, and the movie was far more believable and interesting.  This movie like so many other remakes, the acting feels like the actors just mimic their parts, making it feel very artificial and boring.",1289865600,2,730,4.492424242424242
