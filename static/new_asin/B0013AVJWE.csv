3102671,5,B0013AVJWE,Probably the best free movie on Amazon Prime that I've seen so far. In the car crash scene I laughed so hard that monkeys came out of nowhere. It was crazy.,1402272000,,156,4.064516129032258
3102672,1,B0013AVJWE,"quit watching, not entertaining.  I did not like this movie.  I did not like or continue to watch this movie.",1391990400,,109,4.4
3102673,3,B0013AVJWE,"It as a rate of R on it because for the Language, sexual content and Violence it is 88 mins long Not your average monkey business Beyond Funny! This is one Laugh out Loud film you do not want to miss! I do not real want to say to much about this movie.",1367971200,,252,3.7735849056603774
3102674,3,B0013AVJWE,"Ok, I gave it 3 stars because I watched the whole thing, and wasn't mad at myself for doing so.

I thought it to be a low budget film school ripoff of a Coen Bros/Tarantino genre' reject.

Still... throughout the movie I couldn't help but think of my running buddies from the old days who are all dead now due to un-natural causes.

I would never put this on a must see or favorite list, but I would also never say to not view it.  You just might see a few things that remind you of your own running buddies?",1362182400,,508,4.05
3102675,4,B0013AVJWE,"I picked this movie because it was partially filmed in Jacksonville, FL, in the neighborhood where I live. That was what sparked my interest in this movie.  It was a dark comedy, but all in all was an enjoyable movie.",1223164800,,217,4.425
3102676,5,B0013AVJWE,"You will have to keep rewinding the movie to catch all the things you missed while laughing. Had to do this many times during the film.
Great chemistry between all the guys. Solid acting from everyone.",1213920000,2,201,4.611111111111111
3102677,4,B0013AVJWE,"I bought this movie because I'm a Scott Grimes fan. Admittedly, my expectations for this movie weren't high, because of the poor name change (from Throwing Stars to Who's Your Monkey) and the lack of publicity, including the release directly to DVD. But I quite enjoyed the movie. The actors very naturally seem to be real friends, it's not super gross or offensive like I feared it might be, and it's quite funny.",1213920000,2,414,4.684931506849315
3102678,2,B0013AVJWE,"I rented this video and was disappointed. I thought it was going to be a comedy that starred a trained monkey. The package is VERY misleading. On the front cover is shown a monkey. The monkey has a limited role in the movie-- and of the little time it is on screen, it is not even a live monkey, but a stuffed animal strapped to a guy's leg. Further, the monkey in the movie is not even the same species of monkey shown on the cover. A large picture of an actress also dominates the package. This woman does a fine job but has barely a minute of screen time in the whole movie! About the only true thing said on the package is ""Beyond Funny!"" But that's only if ""beyond"" means ""nowhere near!""

This movie is a minor adventure, but it's definitely not a comedy. The acting is good, the story bland, and the DVD package belongs to a different movie altogether!",1211414400,4,858,4.263803680981595
3102679,5,B0013AVJWE,"Saw this movie yesterday and we're still laughing! Smart, Funny, the way every comedy should be written and acted! Cast had great chemistry and a perfect script! Movie was a low budget production, but you are too busy laughing to care. Can't wait to see the movie again to pick up lines we laughed over!",1206748800,3,303,4.527272727272727
3102680,4,B0013AVJWE,"I normally hate indie low budget movies but Who's Your Monkey avoids all the bad cliches and delivers an original story that is well written and acted.  4 childhood friends must band together to get rid of a lowlife's body. Sounds simple and like something you've seen many times before but this version, with its very true to life buddy dialogue and suprises stands way above the norm.",1206403200,2,386,4.676470588235294

8249615,5,B0013AVJWE,love it good for all ages,1507248000,,25,3.3333333333333335
8249616,4,B0013AVJWE,It's really a 3 1/2 star movie and thanks to Amazon Prime digital credits and a Friday night with not wanting to really do anything this movie filled the bill so to speak. It does start out slow but patience did win out when the monkey finally arrived in this move and Wayne Knight makes an appearance and the movie plot did go full circle. So for a kinda free movie it ain't bad and I don't regret watching it.,1492819200,,411,4.15
8249617,1,B0013AVJWE,"Mediocre acting, plot and continuity.
I would better have spent my time watching cartoons.
Not recommended by any means.",1476921600,,120,5.368421052631579

8249623,5,B0013AVJWE,It's hard to believe that this movie is just under an hour and a half! The plot is jam packed and the soundtrack is great. I don't laugh out loud at many movies but I did so several times while watching this. A bittersweet comedy with a feel good vibe.,1435190400,,252,4.06
8249624,4,B0013AVJWE,worth the time to watch 24hr version of breaking bad in an hour and a half,1410393600,,74,3.6875
