8513213,5,B007AAF34G,"Our middle daughter really enjoys Robot Chicken. The look on her face was all I needed to see to know I had given her the perfect (and very much wanted) Christmas gift.

From what I gather, Robot Chicken is a compilations of wild cartoon's that are most certainly geared for the late teen to adult crowd. Listening to her howl in delight as she saw the entire boxed set let me know that I had indeed given her exactly what she wanted.

(Disclosure: Our daughter is 26. An appropriate gift imo for her age. I have no watched this program and could not recommend for ages 18 and below.)
