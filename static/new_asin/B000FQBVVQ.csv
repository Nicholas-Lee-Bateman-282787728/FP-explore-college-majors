8166682,4,B000FQBVVQ,"This vhs takes 2 or 3 episodes of Waldo Kitty which ran only 16 episodes overall and was made in 1975. It combines live action and takes you on a journey into Waldo's mind which is the cartoon form and then back to live action with the villain(the bull dog) getting the worst end of things.
As for many old vhs tapes this product has a little wear-it's too bad that they have not made a dvd compiling all 16 episodes.",1371427200,,417,4.160493827160494
