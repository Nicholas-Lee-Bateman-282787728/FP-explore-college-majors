2443498,5,B000BWDC1G,"This Midsummer Night's Dream will surprise and delight you. The directorial choices of Bo Bergstrom will make you marvel at the richness of his homespun production AND wonder why conventional films are so conservative.

There is so much more texture that could be explored that most directors, in their slavish thrall to narrative, simply ignore. Notable exceptions are Julie Taymor and Peter Greenaway. Bergstrom's MND is a lot of fun. With the accessibility of effects in software editing programs why not explore the possibilities so the film becomes more painterly. The altered palette in the dance between Titania, Oberon and the changeling is really beautiful as is the music and the chorus work. The blurry distortions of faces adds to the psychological POV of a character. Bergstrom uses font play and graphic inserts to reiterate the script. ""What fools these mortals be"" and ""You minims...you acorn"" etc. are highlighted and often tied back to the titles.

I enjoyed the concept/settings: caves, New Mexico national park woods and the deserted industrial site. Theater has used off-gender casting to great effect and so does Bergstrom.

Don't resist the spell. May you keep reason and love in your company.",1292716800,8,1216,5.1938775510204085

2443507,2,B000BWDC1G,"Even though Midsummer Night's Dream is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, I don't like this production. One actor plays Theseus and Oberon, another (the same actress who plays Rosaline and Beatrice in the RSC's Love's Labour's Lost and Love's Labour's Won) plays Hippolyta and Titania. But she's way too aggressive. Nasty, even, as both characters. And Bottom, who is praised by the blurbs on the paper jacket, is just plain dumb. He can't even remember Peter Quince's name, and his performance as Pyramus isn't funny at all. Nothing in the play is comic in any sense. Bah. Humbug.",1462665600,5,584,4.909090909090909

It's performed on open stage with minimal use of props and backgrounds much like it would have been performed when originally written.

2443520,5,B000BWDC1G,A really funny production. Nick bottom is hilarious. The only weakness in the production was (to my mind) the part of Robin Goodfellow which was played by an actor who couldn't seem to get his breathing right and so his speaking of the lines was a bit jerky. Oberon and Titania were superb as were the Mechanicals. Well worth watching,1435276800,11,334,4.583333333333333
2443521,4,B000BWDC1G,"This is an excellent, straightforward performance of Midsummer Night's Dream, funny, and moving, and creating a fairy world no less magical for being primitive and earthy. Such conception of the fairy world is very much in keeping with the Globe setting as it is probably more consonant with Shakespeare's world than with our later post-Mendelssohn Victorian notions.  I have seen in movies and theatre more Midsummers than any other Shakespeare play and this is the clearest exposition of the play I recall. Central to the play is Puck, more so than any other character. Matthew Tennyson is outstanding with sure command of verse and given extraordinary yet subtle stage movement that at times evokes as much delight in the mischief he causes as exasperation with the royals. At the end he casts the proper enchantment in closing the play. The pairs of lovers are superb, funny and passionate in whatever iteration of coupling. The whole cast indeed is superlative. The rustics are very funny on their own. The reason I subtracted a star from my review is that the staging of Pyramus and Thisbe was disappointingly overdone, with emphasis on rather ordinary slapstick; it remained unfunny, and certainly not up to others I have seen. More importantly, it was not commensurate with the brilliant, swift staging of the various interactions between Lysander, Leander, Hermia and Helena. But such flaw is not fatal, and should not discourage anyone from purchasing this dvd, as there are many joys to be had in watching this performance.
NB: The DVD box says that the discs are subtitled in English, German and French, and that there is a bonus of a cast gallery. The discs contain neither subtitles nor cast gallery.",1433894400,42,1714,4.993006993006993

2443525,4,B000BWDC1G,"Warning: This review below was written for the 2010 Virus Theatre production , not for the 1968 Peter Hall directed performance with Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, Ian Holm,  and Ian Richardson. Amazon put the one review to the two very different productions.

***** Based on now having seen five films of the play, I would rate this Peter Hall direction with at least 4 1/2 stars, based mostly on strong acting from a cast, most of whom would become well known in British and American film. This production is nicely balanced, giving good emphasis to all parts of Shakespeare's play; however the lions share of talent is given to the fairy characters and to the two pair of young lovers. The Mechanicals subplot gets full time, but less name talent; however, they match the impression of stronger casts, without quite reaching the heights of James Cagney in the role of Bottom. The half star loss is mostly due to the weak acting by Michael Jayston and David Warner as Demetrius and Lysander, and the really weak realization of Bottom's ass's head. The fairy effects are nicely done with live children actors, although Ian Holm's special effects seem a bit strained.

 In the recent Hollywood version with Kevin Kline's being turned into an ass, they did it much better by just applying simple makeup and appliances to Kline's face, plus ass's ears. Ian Holm as Puck and Diana Rigg as Helena were good in those key roles, although Rigg does not put quite as much into it as did Callista Flockhart in the 1999 Hollywood version. Ian Richardson and Judi Dench were believable as Oberon and Titania, but those roles always seem to be difficult to pull off, as are the roles of the Duke Theseus and his bride Hippolyta.

*** I give the 2010 production only three stars with great reluctance, because any serious production of a Shakespeare play deserves serious attention. But this production should NOT be your first experience with this play. If you are new to Shakespeare, then the star studded production with Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer is the one you want. If you are familiar with Shakespeare, then perhaps the 1968 version directed by Derek Hall or the Royal Shakespeare Company version of 2005 with the same director, Derek Hall. There is also another Royal Shakespeare Theatre production from 1999, directed by Adrian Noble. There are also three or four other notable performances, some going back to the Hollywood of 1935 with Dick Powell and James Cagney.

I would also direct you to the fact that some of the four and five star reviews of this production are actually reviews of different productions such as the one starring Judi Dench and Helen Mirren.

When I saw that this was shot in the mountains and forests of the Southwest, I was not expecting that the opening scene between Theseus and Hippolyta would occur while they are rock climbing. This is imaginative, but it runs totally contrary to the roles these two characters have in the play. They are ruling nobility, not rock climbing hippies (not that the hippy theme could not work. It does not work in this film.)

The outdoors venue and the delivery of speeches has a seriously adverse effect on the clarity of the sound we hear. Shakespeare is hard enough when the sound is obscured by not facing the microphones or by lots of ambient noise. The actors seem to enunciate as clearly as they do on the stage of the Globe, but it does tend to get muddy now and then. Someone who has no idea what the play is about will have a really hard time with this.

Another adaptation which may confuse is when male parts are played by women. In many plays, this may not seem to make a big difference, but in this play, it is all about gender roles, and the four male - female pairings present in the story. Having women play men, especially a carpenter (Peter Quince) is confusing today, and especially confusing for a play taking place in ancient Athens, or even 19th century Italy.

This interpretation of the play has one solid positive mark going for it. It includes virtually all of Shakespeare's words, which is why it runs about an hour longer than most other productions. I would reserve this for your third viewing of the play, assuming you are as much in love with it as many have been.",1370649600,3,4258,4.672897196261682
2443526,4,B000BWDC1G,"A micro-budget production, and a charming bit of Americana. It's filmed in the wilderness, which offered some beautiful shots. The acting, on the other hand, is suburban in scope, starring everytown's local acting troupe, but scores some laughs. Don't expect the RSC, it's amateur fun.

The fairy scenes are lovingly composed, a real delight. The whole production is safe for children. Four stars, grading on a steep amateur curve, the mechanicals were that much the funnier for it.",1309392000,6,482,5.17948717948718
2443527,4,B000BWDC1G,"Having been present for most of the shooting of this movie, I am at once a biased reporter and a privileged witness.  In fact a fair bit of what appears on the screen passed through my camera.

Shakespeare's story has been in production more or less continuously for over 400 years.  It has its own life, incarnating upon innumerable stages through countless casts and directors.  It has lived into the time of motion pictures, appearing in diverse real and constructed locations.

This version unfolds in a fairyland lovingly evoked in rural New Mexico.  It burrows in caves, clings to cliffsides, dances in forests.  If you want your Shakespeare blocked out on stage, this one is not for you.  If you love the story and the permutations of it, you'll enjoy this telling.

If you are dedicated to extreme low-budget movie production or aspire to such work, the piece will be both inspirational and instructive.  It demonstrates how craft, imagination, skill and patience can work magic from almost nothing - especially in comparison to the production budgets of today's super-glossy ""real"" movies.

As is often the case with bare-bones productions, sound quality suffers at times.  A few lines are hard to understand, especially given the unfamiliar language and phrasing.  But the players ARE acting. If your ears didn't catch some words their body language conveys mood and meaning.

Occasionally a performer or interaction falters and I wish there had been another, better take.  But this happens also on stage, where there are no retakes.  In these bits momentum is quickly recovered...the ball may be fumbled but it is never dropped.

Story and locations are well seen but it is evident that this is a digital video production shot on locations, mostly by available light. It is far from studio gloss and I believe that's a good thing.  The show has just enough DV home movie quality to where we have no doubt that these performers are real people in real places, telling this story, drawing us deeper and deeper into its humor, beauty and wisdom.  No small thing.

Time and again the story rises to a magical plane - notably in the Fairies' Lullaby, in Bottom's transformation and his capture by Tatania.  Oberon's lair, Titania's fury, the sonambulastic dance of those two.  Hermia and Helena's bewilderment and rage.  The finale.  For all its humble origins there's potent cinema here.

I have some reservations about Bergstrom's use of overlaid titles but the device is employed sparingly and in a consistent fashion.  As a filmmaker I find myself pondering this element, anticipating that a response will someday appear in my own work.

Heather Costellos's perfermance as Hermia, Sam Bensusan's Bottom, Rory Gregory's Changeling, Becca Anderson as Puck - all stand out in my mind among the large, focused cast who gave a great deal over a long time to gift us with this playful play.

The score and musical performances by Joseph Rivers are potent assets.  A world-music flavor floating in today's world, it maintians a wonderful 17th Century mood, sustaining our ""Dream"" without ever becoming bombastic.  Songs by Maria Casler from the original Virus Theater production just melt my heart every time.

At 157 minutes this is a long show.  It rewards repeated viewing.",1299628800,12,3279,4.992619926199262
2443528,5,B000BWDC1G,"Shakespeare most famous comedy, ""Midsummer Night Dream"" narrated through the directing lenses of Bo Bergstrom's camera and the talented Virus Theater actors' interpretation is filled with fun, romance and mischief. The superb acting and the director's skilful framing of nature virtually moves the viewers into a world of fairies, royalty and romance. If Shakespeare could see this film, he will be very satisfied with both Bergstrom's directing and Virus Theater's actors' fine and unique interpretation of his romantic tale.",1294272000,4,526,5.670886075949367

Julie Tamor's production is absolutely wonderful and I was enthralled from the beginning even though I have always found the story a bit silly. The casting is excellent and Puck, played by Kathryn Hunter, is especially hilarious and charming. I went back and looked at a several other versions of Midsummer Night's Dream and found them dull and uninspiring compared to Julie Tamor's production.

Hippolyta/ Titania, Theseus/ Oberon and Helena spent the play Shouting. Puck made....a choice, and played it like an animated sawhorse on drugs. Bottom minced his way through the show with his pinky stuck in the corner of his mouth and actually thought the role would be funnier by making up his own lines and inserting them into the text. One of the fairies thought she added to the production by Screaming...OFTEN. (Of course I felt like doing so as well.) Lysander got no laughs with the lines, but managed to get quite a few by ""making mouths"" after he spoke. Just appalling. The best actor, and the only one who did what he should have done was Mustardseed; he was quite good and when I noticed Flute as Thisbe also in control, I looked up the credits and saw it was the same actor. I made the mistake of thinking a Globe production meant quality and was sorely disappointed.",1501372800,4,918,4.502994011976048
