8389227,4,B0035QBTH4,"I really like the DVD scenery and many times the scripture has been so uplifting and had the exact message I needed for that precise moment. The more you see the Word written and even if you glance at it It really stays with you and ministers to you. The music isn't exactly what I can listen to over and over depending on my activities but I have that on too sometimes. I do like to leave it on the screen and then put the christian music station on sometimes while in the same room so that I can still have the benefit of watching the WORD and receiving the MESSAGE.
the quality of the DVD is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money and I plan to get some for my friends who work in an office all day long.

8389229,5,B0035QBTH4,"A copy of this DVD was given to me by a nurse at Kaiser hospital when my mother was quite ill. Unhappily, for me, she passed away shortly after; I had played the DVD for her 24/7,even after she no longer seemed aware of it. I purchased extra copies to gift our Pastor and other friends. Her amazing act of kindness made an otherwise unhappy experience less so.",1353456000,,360,4.3088235294117645
