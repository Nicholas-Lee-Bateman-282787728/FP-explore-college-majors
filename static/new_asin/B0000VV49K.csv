8003881,3,B0000VV49K,"""In the film starring Christine Lahti is (sic!) about a scientist experimenting with DNA and accidentally creates a monster. It's a nicely done,must see movie!!""
It was this 2003 review (it is now 2013) by "" a customer"",  which stimulated me to buy and watch this film. To my surprise, there are no  ""monsters"" as most of us understand that word; the monsters are the potential hazards of the biochemical experiments (to simplify the proper designation) of Dr. Henderson. Instead of Boris Karloff rampaging through the Village and townspeople  taking up arms to destroy the Monster and his Creator, Dr. Frankenstein, we have a Town Council deciding upon whether (in effect) to prevent a Noble Prize Winner from proceeding with experiments which might endanger the health of its citizens.
Furthermore, it is not filled with wild-eyed radicals seeking to take over the laboratory, with force, being  attacked by Savagely Brutal Storm Troopers in policemen's uniforms, but a mild comedy in the tradition, but not with the quality, of Thurber and Nugent's delightful stage comedy, converted to a film starring Henry Fonda, Olivia De Havilland and Jack Carson, The Male Animal, which argued the right of an English Professor to read the letters of Vanzetti in his classroom, as an example of literature written by a non-professional.
It is a mild comedy, in which Stephen Collins and Nehemiah Persoff are forced into an embarrassing amount of overacting, while Christine Lahti, is allowed to look good and make a speech pointing out the dangers she precipitated while assisting the Great Man.
This is not a film which I would recommend you run right out to get (or the internet equivalent) but it does, despite itself and its convoluted, fragmented, way of presenting the arguments, raise problems which you may want to think about. It also has some amusing moments.",1367020800,,1861,5.052117263843648
8003882,3,B0000VV49K,"The film was interesting and had a lot of neat scenes from the time period in which the film took place.  However, the pace was a little slow, which made it a little boring at times.  Overall, I thought it was a good film and probably one that I will look at again.",1163116800,6,265,3.981132075471698
