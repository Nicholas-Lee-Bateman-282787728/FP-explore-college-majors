8304637,5,B001GAHW6I,"My niece LOOOOOOVES Pocoyo and before she could talk she was mesmerised by the characters, their simple forms and the great humor in all the videos.  A MUST have for any toddler- and fun to watch as a parent!  Stephen Fry's is the voice that helps all the characters in their adventures.  Magic.",1266364800,,295,4.528301886792453
8304638,4,B001GAHW6I,"The videos are excellent and the rating concerns language options of these particular videos, not quality or content of the videos. We were disappointed that these videos had only two language options and neither was the original language (Spanish).  These videos were produced in Spain and the original language is Spanish.  We already had two Pocoyo videos and since the mother's background is early childhood education especially like them for babies because the background is white (thus focus is on the characters).  We want to expose the children to as many languages as possible, but the parents now are teaching American English and Spanish concurrently.  However, the only two language options for these videos is English (British, not American, which is OK) and French. Some of the Pocoyo DVD's have more language options, so don't assume as we did that all do.",1263513600,,871,5.112676056338028
