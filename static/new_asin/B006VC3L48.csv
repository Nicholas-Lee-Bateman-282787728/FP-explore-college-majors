I don't like that they were,  but still, there are enough laughs too keep you busy for quite some time.....  One of the best tv shows ever.  I can't really add anything that hasn't already been said about these shows.......  Now,...  It's time to release the rest of this show ...",1353888000,5,363,4.3283582089552235
5020381,5,B006VC3L48,"Laverne & Shirley was just a great video.  We laughed through every episode.  Listening to the music before the episode started brought on a flood of good feelings.  Laverne & Shirley complimented each other, Shirley forever the wise, good girl and Laverne always looking for a date.  Laverne's loving father was a jewel and Mrs. Babish was quite the entertainer.  AND Big Rosie and Laverne had a relationship you could not find in today's modern women.  They fought, and remained friends,  I must not forget Carmin, his singing and dancing was pleasant to watch.  Each episode brought back memories of a time lost.  The skits were funny and realistic, sometimes conveying a message about life.  Linny & Squiggie, were absolutely charming & very funny.  ""Hello"" classic Squiggie line.  There was one episode where Laverne & Shirley had become older women, still unmarried and stumbling around as some older women of that time period were portrayed.  Later on that evening I saw Laverne (Penny Marshall) on a talk show, some 32 years later.  What an eye opener to the passage of time.  Laverne had aged and so had I.  My husband and I sincerely enjoyed this series of Laverne & Shirley.  5 Stars.",1351555200,5,1195,4.836633663366337

5020386,5,B006VC3L48,"I don't care if some people thought this show was silly and juvenile. I still consider it one of the funniest shows ever. Not just funny, but it really had a ""heart"" and there was always a little lesson or statement about trust, friendship, love, cooperation, tolerance--which are sadly missing from most of today's dismal TV comedies. I think Penny Marshall is the best comedienne at physical comedy since Lucy; there are some classics in this collection. It was great to find all the ""Milwaukee"" seasons together in a pack for such a good price.",1386633600,,547,4.768421052631579
5020387,5,B006VC3L48,"I bought this series for my mentally challenged brother,  He loves retro shows ans music.  Much of it is hard to find. Once he locks on to something he obsesses over it and  there is no letteing up until he gets what he is looking for.  Often I have to turn the table and realize that his request may be rediculous to me, but it is inortant to him.  His wants and needs sometime break the bank, But I do the best I can,  I recentky learned that Amazon is a pretty much one stop shopping. Over all I give this transaction 5 STARS for a job well done. From ordering; through processing; and all the way to delivery",1382918400,2,612,4.100840336134453

8504920,5,B006VC3L48,"One of the greatest comedy TV shows ofall time,and the 2 girls go together-1 is 1 of the world's best actresses,later to be nicknamed ""The Petite Actress"",the otherwho was 1 of TV's greatest comediennes and became 1 of the greats behind the camera,too. Both thought in terms of ""If we don't find it funny,chances are that they wont,either.""Life on Knapp Street in Miwaukee,working as bottlecappers,was heir forte. Moving to California for seasons 6,7,and 8 was just Paramount trying to reboot the show after they sent its ratings flying downhill fast by tearing it and Happy Days apart and selling L&S to a different channel. If you ask me, they just don't belong in Hollywood-people there aren't poor people that barely made it out of high school,they're spoiled brats with too much money and college educations or they're celebrities.",1458259200,,836,5.065217391304348
