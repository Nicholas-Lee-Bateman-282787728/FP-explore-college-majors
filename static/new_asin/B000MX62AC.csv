8173252,4,B000MX62AC,"This is a great show and features a series of matches pitting ROH vs AJPW. Match ups like Homicide vs Satoshi Kojima, Aj Styles vs Kaz Hayashi, and Great Muta and Arashi vs The Prophecy ( Chris Daniels and Dan Maff) are all enjoyable and entertaining. There is some really good storytelling in these matches and CM Punk on commentary is both insightful and hilarious. Not to mention Punk wrestles in a tag match!
