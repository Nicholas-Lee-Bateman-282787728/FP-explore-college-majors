2961565,4,B000W641W0,"The video quality and sound are very good for an early 70's low budget Hong Kong kung fu film. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the story is well paced. Bruce Lee fans will quickly notice the similarities between this picture, and The Chinese Connection, as both were produced by Raymond Chow (Bruce's long time business partner), and were made in the same style. I loved this ""blast from the past"".",1351555200,2,411,4.722222222222222
2961566,5,B000W641W0,"In my opinion this flick should be credited with TOP honors for world-wide kung fu-proliferation, alongside classics like ""King Boxer"" and, of course, Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection"", all from the same year.  This combines the former's fight-frequency and plot-feasibility with the latter's top-notch fight-quality!  If you like 70s kung fu, you CANNOT go wrong with this film!

Angela Mao (""Broken Oath"") plays Yu Ying, a Chinese girl studying Hapkido in Japan-occupied Korea with her two brothers, Fan Wei (Action director Sammo Hung, ""Knockabout"") and Kao Chung (Carter Wong, ""Story of the Dragon"").  After beating up a group of Japanese bullies, their master (Hapkido ultra-Grandmaster Ji Han Jae) urges the trio to return to Japan-occupied China and open up a dojo, spreading the art as a means of self-discipline and resistance to tyranny, though with a strong emphasis on tolerance.  They agree and head home, little dreaming that the Japanese Black Bear Karate school will threaten their peace, patience and, possibly, their lives.

Yeah, the plot is fairly formulaic but the fights are WAY ahead of their time!  Not only are the near-constant altercations fast but there are some groovy, legitimate Hapkido moves shown, particularly from Grandmaster Ji in the film's early moments AND in the form of a rare good-guy appearance from the always-impressive Whang In Shik (""Young Master""), standing-by for an early sparring session and one full-on bash later on!  The Japanese master (Yamane Turuo, ""Lone Wolf and Cub: Sword of Vengeance"") also gets to show some sweet Karate maneuvers! I should probably mention that our 3 leads are not too bad either!

I've been collecting Angela Mao movies for quite awhile and have been waiting almost as long for a decent release of this, mostly because Dragon Dynasty was supposed to distribute one a few years ago!  While they're asleep at the wheel, Bonsai Media finally offers up this remastered, widescreen version with an English dub OR original language with English subs!  Yes, it is a bootleg but it's the best you can currently get and, in my opinion, is totally worth the price!  And let's not forget some seriously funky opening credits!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I guess my standards are higher or I received a different DVD than the one's that got 3 stars or above in the other reviews. My DVD looked like it was copied from a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape. Picture quality throughout ranged from fair to poor and in many places there was static and lines in the picture. If that was the only thing wrong I would have been ok with it as I have collected many older videos that are so-so for their nostalgic value. The worst thing about this DVD is that its copied from a pan and scan version that has been re-centered and enlarged so anything that isn't in the exact center of the picture is cut off and cannot be seen. For example...when the credits roll at the beginning you can only see a part of a name or a credit. Throughout the film there are many scenes where two or more people are out of frame to the right or left (or both) of the picture then you might see half a face, part of a leg, or a sudden fist come flying in to frame not knowing who it belongs to.

It's the same formula.  It's predictable, but I still love it.  Besides Billy Jack movies, I don't know of any other HAPKIDO movies.  This dvd includes two editions of the same movie.

8221338,4,B000W641W0,"I'm not the best person to review this film, since I'm not its intended audience. My taste in martial arts movies is several years more recent than this 1972 production. But you know what? - I'm impressed nonetheless. ""Hapkido"" is a simple, questionably-proportioned fightfest that will push the buttons of Hong Kong action fans from this period who value hand-to-hand brawls over weapons and wirework...and mine, too.

The story: Three young Chinese masters of hapkido - played by Angela Mao (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Taekwondo-Strikes/dp/B0028MJH1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Taekwondo Strikes</a>), Carter Wong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Traitorous/dp/B00009IAXD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Traitorous</a>), and Sammo Hung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnificent-Butcher/dp/B00008WJE3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnificent Butcher</a>) - return to China from their tutelage in Korea to open schools of their own, but are quickly caught up in deadly trouble with a Japanese martial arts school run amuck over the local population.

There really isn't more to the plot than that. The occupation of Korea and Manchuria by Japan plays heavily into the plot, giving the film a very nationalistic slant: the Japanese occupiers are all racist troublemakers, and only the equally racist (but justified!) Chinese masters can stop them from abusing the defenseless population. The period setting of the film keeps this in perspective, but there's no denying that the movie's story is simplistic. Similarly, there's little nuance when it comes to the acting, and absolutely no ambiguity between good guys and villains, but this has its own retro charm - fans of ham drama will be rolling.

The fight content is where the real strength of the film lies, and is it ever mighty in this regard. For quantity, this one's hard to beat, with no less than 25 full-length brawls throughout - an amount that modern flicks have an especially hard time matching - and of pretty good quality as well. I admit, I don't really go for 70s-style kung fu choreography - the pacing just isn't my thing - but there are some definite exceptions to the rule here, thanks to the undeniable athleticism. I don't much care for the film's alternative ""Lady Kung Fu"" title, because although Angela Mao may be the main attraction, her partners Carter and Sammo have just as prominent a presence. Mao is used as the film's trump card, not fighting much until the last third, where she cuts loose with inimitable skill and grace. As he always would, Sammo defies the laws of physics and looks the best taking a fall. Carter's good, but he has the unenviable task of trying to live up to the extraordinary showings of his costars.

Some animal abuse about halfway through the film troubled me, but it doesn't weigh too strongly on the movie 40+ years later. I haven't been converted to the Cult of Classic Kung Fu yet, but ""Hapkido"" - whether or not it's actually a faithful representation of that particular art - is a lot of fun and worth a watch for all martial art fans. I recommend the Fortune Star release over the Bonzai version shown here, but in whatever way you watch it, the action at least will not disappoint.",1422835200,,3341,5.481553398058252
