Very low budget but weird and different, give it a shot.",1501891200,,155,4.571428571428571

8729261,2,B0141KAA1I,"There's a lot of reasons why some folks would like this movie.  I could've been one of them.  I enjoy Bad Taste, Premutos, Zombie Doom, Meat Market 1 and 2, Zombie Bloodbath 3, Sledgehammer, and many similar no budget insane shot-on-the-mega-cheap genre.

The problem with Bread and Circus, for one, is the majority of the dialogue is in a foreign language, which is fine, but there's no subtitles.  I have no idea what anybody is saying.  There's a narrator that speaks English every once in awhile, but they don't do much to piece together an already whacky off the wall plot.

There is some splatter, but I've seen so much in the past, Bread and Circus doesn't go as over-the-top as I wanted.  Plus, things get sexualized for no real reason.  It's more focused on poop jokes and bathroom humor rather than the grue and horror of it all.

I don't mind pointlessness, or plotlessness, but I was very confused during most of the movie.  Certain scenes are very artsy and random in nature.  You get that a lot in no budget movies (Insaniac, Shatter Dead), but this really takes the cake.

I don't want to completely dog on it, because the attempt has its few standout moments.  The scope of it is bigger than your average no budget horror film.  It's cool to see foreign small budget films.  I'm always ready to give things a chance, but I wasn't overimpressed.  For six or seven bucks, though, if you're dying to see it, and you've seen everything else, you might give this one a shot.  It's very hard to recommend it, though.",1451347200,3,1526,4.551470588235294

I hadnt even read that before sitting down here to type this out and I was already going to make the same comparison, because this movie is full of bizarre things, but above all else might be the closes thing youll find to classic splatter loving Peter Jackson movies out there on the market. This goes to show that the new RAW brand from Wild Eye Releasing isn't just here to give you cool covers for SOV loving indie flicks, it also is here to bring you some of the strangest and goriest movies from around the world, and this Norwegian mind trip brings to the table something that might not be easy to really label, but you won't be able to look away from the screen regardless of whatever genre or type of film you want to call this. Sure, I wish it was in widescreen and not the 1:33 it comes to us in, but I guess we should be lucky we have it at all and aren't trying to import a region 2 version of this you have to see it to believe it film.

The film is clearly on a whole other level as far as splatter movies go. This one will be called out for such things as the opening scene and the other rude and crude things that follow from start to finish, but this is also a very smart movie. One that makes you think, if you don't let it pass you by without putting more thought into it. And if you don't want to think, well you still have a whole lot of blood and weirdness in front of you to enjoy. And I think about anyone who loved the stranger side of cinema will certainly enjoy this one. I hope more things like this are on the way from Wild Eye Releasing, because you don't see stuff like this everyday and until now and this release I hadnt even heard of this one before. Now having seen this one myself, it makes me wonder just what other foreign goodies like this might be out there.",1451347200,,1886,4.083557951482479
