8492349,5,B006421JJY,It's still amazing to me how radio turned out such dazzling shows as The Adventures of Sam Spade week after week for eight years.  Especially in light of what network television has become.  These shows are still so fresh and fun sixty years on..,1362614400,,246,4.568181818181818
