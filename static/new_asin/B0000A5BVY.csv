7996166,5,B0000A5BVY,Great video,1468713600,,11,5.0
7996167,5,B0000A5BVY,It was for one of our nephews who wants to be a sniper in the military.  He like it very much.,1421971200,,94,3.4761904761904763
7996168,5,B0000A5BVY,This is a great book in the sense that it's a great reference guide on what to buy. It doesn't take the place of actually getting out in the field and working on your equipment.,1366329600,,177,4.085714285714285
7996169,4,B0000A5BVY,"SNIPER - UPDATED AND EXPANDED... OK. It's larger-size book
from his previous works. Larger print, larger illustrations,
larger type. But that's OK. It covers virtually everything
taught at Army Sniper School. It's as up to date as it could
be considering that the art is constantly being improved with
techniques and equipment. Nevertheless it's a thorough work.
What?  You expect a plot?  Nope. It's a text book and the
only thing it's missing is an index.  But you'd know where to
find it if you'd studied it, so get with the program or
you could become a target yourself without this knowledge.",1296691200,,597,4.833333333333333
7996170,2,B0000A5BVY,"This video is not as good as the book.  The training in this video is basic information, it does not really teach the ballistic challenges and how to compensate for them.  This is a good video for someone with no weapons training.",1235952000,,230,4.4523809523809526
7996171,2,B0000A5BVY,"If you've read the book, which has some descent information and building blocks for this topic, pass on this video. I'll give the Major the benefit of the doubt here and guess it's his first acting attempt. Some of the camo is geared toward hunting since anyone watching the intro would shoot his hookie camo wrap thing. His attempt to show you the real techniques which he described in the book is lost in this video. Half way through I was fighting to pay attention and feeling rather sleepy. That being said I do recommend the Advance Ultimate Sniper dvd. Read my review on that title.",1216425600,3,588,4.556603773584905
7996172,3,B0000A5BVY,"the dvd shows the basics of what snipers do. not an advanced course, more of  an intoduction.",1193961600,3,93,4.470588235294118
7996173,1,B0000A5BVY,"please if you have not expirience at all with snipers this dvd won't help you the guy just talks about many things that are not real important if you don't know how to measure your target and how to graduate your scope
you will loose your money because he do not teach that

besides really bad sound and image",1185235200,4,309,4.237288135593221
7996174,3,B0000A5BVY,"Very interesting content.  In my opinion, one of the better documentary on the basic makings of a Sniper.  The video quality is similar to VHS tape (that has been played more than enough).  It would have received 4  stars if the video quality was DVD or HD equivalent.  I hope the Major would release a better quality version as I would not mind spending on the same title that has a better video quality format.  It would have received 5 stars if the on-the-field diagrams are computer generated in sequence as to illustrate the effectiveness in range/target gauging, etc.",1184457600,19,573,4.737373737373737
7996175,2,B0000A5BVY,Very poor sound quality ruins the whole DVD. There is some good info but I could hardly stand to listen to it. This should cost only $5 or $10 at the most.,1130716800,41,155,3.875
