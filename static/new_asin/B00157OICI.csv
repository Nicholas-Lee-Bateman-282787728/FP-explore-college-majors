3140453,5,B00157OICI,"I remember the Curious George books pretty well from my own childhood, so when I first saw this animated series, I was skeptical. Would it be as fun and educational as the original books? The answer surprised me ... it's BETTER!

The DVD consists of a series of short segments that are perfect for toddlers AND their parents. Each episode is full of humor. Your three-year-old may not get all the jokes, but you will! Each focuses on a specific concept: balance, coral reefs, leverage, and even paleontology. Each has a positive, pro-curiosity, pro-science message. There is a brief ""reality"" segment at the end, where a group of real children expand on the concepts presented in the cartoon segments. Both the animation and the background music are first-rate.

I can't even put my two-year-old to bed nowadays without at least a few episodes of ""Cur George."" He loves it, and ... yes, I'll admit it ... I think it's fun too.",1236038400,12,926,4.745341614906832
3140454,5,B00157OICI,"My two year old daughter is obsessed with Curious George and all the dvd's that are available in the series, except the one about being scared of the dark.  I believe that scary episode is on ""Rocket ride"".  All the other George Dvd's including this one are really great for young children.",1225843200,3,290,4.5576923076923075
3140455,5,B00157OICI,"My 2.5-year-old daughter adores George the ""funny monkey""--his adventures are gentle and well-drawn.  One of the aspects of the program I like best, however, is that each animated segment is followed by a live-action segment showing elementary school-aged kids participating in some activity related to the story.  Balance concepts, for example, after a story of George and a high wire act.  This format adds an additional learning element to the stories, and recalling my own reactions as a child to kids slightly older than me doing neat things, they have an inspirational quality that I would hope encourages children to move beyond the televised stories and do their own experimentation.",1221436800,5,691,5.263636363636364
3140456,5,B00157OICI,My son loves curious george and I have to admit I don't mind watching them either! This video is fantastic!,1218758400,,107,4.4
3140457,4,B00157OICI,"George is always getting into trouble, but it's always okay in the end.  These stories are similar to all of the other Curious George episodes.  My 3 & 5 year old enjoy them, but don't ask to watch them over and over again like some other movies.",1218326400,,246,4.212765957446808
3140458,5,B00157OICI,"As a child I couldn't get enough of George.  I would check out as many of the books as I was allowed to and had a stuffed George that wore a red sweater with his name on it.  I could never bring myself to give the stuffed George away and now I am even more glad that I didn't.
My almost three year old daughter loves George just as much, if not more, than I did.  She keeps asking for us to turn the TV to the cartoon all morning until it is on and wants to watch the DVD I just bought her all the time.  If I let her, she'd probably watch it all day long.  She can't get enough of George and I've found myself falling in love with him all over again.
This DVD is the only one we currently own but I love it!  George is just too cute and the trouble he gets himself into is typical of a child.  I was so excited when I read in TV Guide that PBS was making a series based on the books but never got around to watching it until recently.  I think my daughter loves George because she is so much like him.  They are both little trouble-making monkeys.  I plan on buying my daughter more of these DVD's until she grows out of them or they stop making them.",1217289600,,1152,3.8638297872340424

Other dvds don't seem to keep her attention right now, but if I need to cook dinner or get ready to go somewhere, I can pop this in and know that she'll stay put. Some of the original Curious George books are dated and refer to a ""fat"" man or a ""bad"" monkey, which are labels we don't use. These DVDs are current and inclusive of different people. George always does something to create trouble, but the story focuses on problem solving. The stories are short and followed by a segment with children talking about the story.

George always does something to create trouble, but the story focuses on problem solving. The stories are short and followed by a segment with children talking about the story.
