1666341,5,B00005UO76,"I remember watching this show in 1989 as a kid, and was lucky enough to own several of the episodes on VHS.  I owned The Ringer, The Missing Link (with Cold Spells and The Moblins are Revolting) and four Mario cartoons (Butch Mario and the Luigi Kid, The Great BMX Race, King Mario of Cremelot, and Mario meets Koopzilla).
I will admit the packaging on the pack says the cartoons are from ""The Adventures of Zelda"".  There was no such game, no such series.  Unless they meant the CD-i Zelda's Adventure, which they didn't, it is a mistake.  It should be ""The Legend of Zelda"".  Also, it should be noted their are seven Mario episodes, and two Zelda.  The seventh is a bonus for completing the Trivia Game.
I don't know what DIC's obsession with Inspector Gadget is, but he is everywhere on this DVD.  Well, the menu is decent, and the quality of the video is quite good, better than the VHS versions.  I will say if you run this on your PS2, you will encounter skipping and freezes.  It ran fine on my conventional DVD player, but as with other DVDs, PS2 still has some problems.
There is the option to just play the episodes in order, or you can select an episode.  The bonus one is only available if you complete the Trivia Game, which asks questions about the cartoons.  Bit of a hassle, but still fun.  ...the commentary by Lou Albano does NOT run automatically, nor is it impossible to disable.
For any hardcore fan, this is a real treat.",1014854400,,1443,4.424242424242424
1666342,1,B00005UO76,"Now that I have more time....
There's not only the problem of the missing commentary, but the quality of the entire DVD.  It's awful.  Not only are 80% of the live action parts just plain NOT THERE now, but the sound doesn't synch up on some of the episodes, inspector gadget's constant presence through the menus is just awful and useless, and the dvd's box says that it contains ""8 complete episodes, stereo, exciting game, trailers, scene access, english subtitles, and much more.""  Well, it has 8 partial episodes, stereo, a lame 8 question trivia game, a sort-of trailer for their StH cartoon, subtitles, and nothing at all more.
And I don't know how the other reviewers even saw it in january, it just came out this week.  Shame on DIC and Trimark for releasing this in it's sorry state.",1014768000,,793,4.642857142857143
1666343,3,B00005UO76,"This is a much-beloved cartoon from my childhood, so it was pretty obvious I was going to get this. As I put it in the player, I had my fingers crossed. ""Please, don't cut out the opening live-action segments with Mario (played by Captin Lou) and Luigi in their plumbing headquarters, where they would often run into special guests, including Magic Johnson."" That whole quote, yes. But, it wasn't my day, or the day of any Super Mario Bros. Super Show Completist (oh, they're out there).
Here's what they cut out of each episode that I noticed:
The Opening Song that introduced the entire show (they included the song that introduced the cartoon segment, though only on ONE episode).
The Live-Action segments with Captain Lou and uh... Luigi.
The end credit Do-The-Mario song from nearly episode.
As soon as one cartoon ends it goes into the next cartoon, no credits or anything. That's something they used to do on cartoon VHS (ninja turtles, for example) that upset me, even when I was a kid. You think with DVD they would stop that. That's one of the nice things about DVD... if you don't want to watch the credits, you can skip them. GIVE ME MY LIVE-ACTION CAPTAIN LOU!
Other than that, it's pretty cool, because it does contain 6 episodes (most DVDs of TV shows only include 3 or 4 episodes per disc) of Mario (which aired Monday thru Thursday) and then 2 episodes of Zelda (which replaced it on Friday). So, for fans, this is all we have, so, I don't want to recommend or not recommend this disc, but I hope what I said helps.",1014681600,,1532,4.534296028880866
1666344,4,B00005UO76,"This is a great rendition of the original Mario Super show, and Zelda show. Cool animation, with great audio. Way to go, Nintendo!",1012694400,,130,4.695652173913044
1666345,5,B00005UO76,"Let me start by saying that this is by no means a really great cartoon.  I'd reccomend this to younger audiences and die hard Nintendo fans.  I have been playing Nintendo since I was 2.5 years old.  Mario was my first game, and I just bought Luigi's Mansion a couple of months ago.  I love Nintendo, and I have for the last 13 years.  The Super Mario Brothers Super Show was a TV show running around 1989 and was released on video around the same time.  I own two of these videos.  I also remember watching the show on television and have several episodes taped.  It's a really fun show for any Mario Brothers fan.  It has all the characters and they live up to their video game counterparts.  The great bonus for me is the inclusion of two episodes of the Zelda Cartoon.  Any Zelda fan wants to know more about the Zelda story and see Link and Zelda in action.  This is the place.  Included on this DVD are two episodes of the Legend of Zelda Cartoon.  They are very rare and very sought after by fans.  I am personally very excited to see these because I'm probably more of a Zelda fan than Mario fan.  If you like Nintendo, toss out your... bucks for this DVD.  If you have a toddler around the house, they'll enjoy it too.  I certainly snatched up my copy the minute I saw it go up for sale.",1012694400,,1295,4.195121951219512
7955074,4,B00005UO76,"Well, the Super Mario Bros. Super Show wasn't a bad show, but I wouldn't say it was the best cartoon back in the 80s. The jokes were okay for kids, but there were so many moan-inducing pasta jokes. Fortunately, each episode would show the Mario Bros, Toad, and Peach in an entirely different setting every time. Robo-Koopa (Robocop?) takes place in the future. Raiders of the Lost Mushroom (Raiders of the Lost Ark) takes place in a jungle.

There are also 2 Zelda episodes packed in here, featuring the characters of the epic game in all its somewhat epic and ear-plugging glory (EXCUUUUUUSE ME, Princess!). They don't spoof movies and they both take place in Hyrule. This series sticks to the game's setting in a nice way.

What I find REALLY weird about this DVD is that Inspector Gadget roams around in the menus. What the heck is Inspector Gadget doing on a Mario DVD? He is from a different show! Another strange thing is that you can click him so he can tell you what the choices do in the menu you click him in. Weird...if you knew how to click on him, I think you would know how everything works in a DVD menu.

There is also a trivia quiz in the DVD. It isn't bad, but it feels a bit bland. I also happen to notice a grammar mistake in one of the questions. Despite that, it's decent.

Overall, this isn't a bad DVD, but it sure is a really strange one.",1302134400,,1363,4.333333333333333
7955075,5,B00005UO76,"good to have these back in my house after all these years! yup folks,this is the o.g. stuff!!!",1179360000,,94,4.277777777777778
7955076,5,B00005UO76,"For those of you that do not know what this show was and, therefore, unaware of what watching an episode is like I can only describe it as this; it's like watching someone get kicked in the nuts, horrible yet satisfying and hilarious.

The acting fails to live up to the standards of most porno's, the sound effects are out of place and in certain situations horribly inappropriate, the dialog boarders on the surreal and inane, calling the ""artwork"" of the cartoons sub-par is more generous than Jesus at a leper convention, there are more plot holes here than in the last season of the X-Files, and the rap and dance, well, the less said about that the better.

Yet this all forms to create one of the best shows ever. I can't explain it, but yelling at your TV. ""WTF!!!!!"" over and over has never been more enjoyable. You'll laugh till your sides hurt, not at the jokes but at the lameness, and at times unintentional creepiness, of it all. If you have kids they'll enjoys it because it's Mario, Link, and all the other great Nintendo characters. If you don't, you and your friends have hours of stuff that is borderline too lame for Mystery Science 3000.

Buy this now!!!",1125014400,,1175,4.533018867924528
7955077,5,B00005UO76,"When you first put the DVD into your DVD player, it will say ""WARNING"" like all DVD's do.  Next, it will show a video of the many glorious cartoon videos/dvd's that DIC sells.
It will then say the title of the DVD, ""Mario's Greatest Movie Moments"".  Right after, it will play the first episode.  If you do not want to watch the first episode, you will have to press ""MENU"" on your remote control.  You may press MENU at any time after the ""WARNING"" message.
In the menu, it will say that you can PLAY the DVD, and will play every episode non-stop in order:
Robo-Koopa
Toad Warrior
Raiders of the Lost Mushroom
Kount Koopula!
Koopenstien!
Koopzilla!
And Zelda episodes:
The missing link
Kiss and Tell
My list of the episodes is not in the order that the DVD displays!
IN THE MAIN MENU, you do not have to click ""PLAY"", you may click ""EPISODE GUIDE"" and see all 8 episodes on the DVD, and pick which you want to watch.
Next, on the main menu, you can view the trailer for DIC DVD's.
LASTLY: You may click ""GAME"".  It is a eight question trivia game, where if you get them right, a NINTH [9] EPISODE UNLOCKS!  If you get a question wrong, you may try again.
The 9th episode is ""Sherlock Mario"".  After the episode, a real-life acting scene by Lou Albano and Danny Wells is played.  [only the portion AFTER ""sherlock mario"" from when it aired back in 1989].  You cannot see the first half of this acting scene.  After a few minutes of the acting scene, a commercial for The Legend of Zelda plays.  Lastly, the rest of the acting scene [a little over a minute worth] is played, and at the end, Mario and Luigi say goodbye and to ""DO THE MARIO!"".  The outro song is then played.
When the outro song is done, the DVD will direct you back to question number 8 and say that you got the answer wrong.  After 3 seconds, it will load question 8 again.  You may answer question 8 or click EXIT to main menu.
THERE YOU HAVE IT, ENJOY!",1036627200,,1920,4.282548476454294
7955078,5,B00005UO76,"This cartoon gives me the entire memories when i use to watch them as a little kid. The DVD may not have the great special features,But if you ever see this sucker available in a store don't think about it just buy it.",1033862400,,218,4.093023255813954
7955079,5,B00005UO76,This is an excelent dvd i like how it sticks to the games very well i like all the video game sounds. I like the game and hidden episode. The MArio dance is so...funny.,1024531200,,168,3.9705882352941178
7955080,4,B00005UO76,"Like the other reviewer said there are defects in this DVD. The bonus Epsiode comes only half and then repeats itself. But the rest is not bad the epsiode are great. This show use to rock when I was a little kid. Plus my opinion 2 of the Zelda epsiodes of all time. These 2 really explains what feelings Princess Zelda has for her hero Link. You love ""The Missing Link"". That is one of the best of all time. No matter what people said it the best period. They should make more DVD but they need to fix the defects.",1020988800,,514,4.099009900990099
7955081,4,B00005UO76,I am a fan of mario cartoons but I would say the super mario world cartoon was way better than the originals.  I mainly bought this dvd for the two bonus zelda cartoons and it was worth it.  The Sonic series is way better that tristar also offers on dvd!,1017100800,,254,4.06

Please Write To DiC, Try to get them to release some more
super mario episoids on DVD, and I hope that you buy this DVD..
The only bad thing is that they cut out some stuff, And

Based mostly on the ""Super Mario Bros 2"" video game, this series has all the best loved characters, Peach (then known as Princess Toadstool), King Koopa, Toad, Birdo, Luigi, and, of course, Mario.  Great, mindless fun!",1015286400,,345,4.913793103448276
