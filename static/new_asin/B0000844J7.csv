7979066,3,B0000844J7,The movie was slow and kind of quirky but I did eventually start to like it. I don't know if I would want to watch it again.,1382140800,,124,3.6296296296296298
7979067,4,B0000844J7,"There was no problem playing the DVD, however there were a lot of scratches on the playable side of the dvd.  So it wasn't ""Like New"" as stated.  However since it did get to me w/in a reasonable time frame and there were no problems due to the scratches, I give it a 4 star rating overall.",1360540800,,289,4.052631578947368
7979068,5,B0000844J7,"I read the book (1978) about two weeks ago, rated it 8/10, discovered
there was a movie version (1980), watched the movie last night while
""Irene"" was storming our neighborhood. The book was slow to start and a
bit difficult to get into. But, once the author ""set the hook"", I
couldn't stop reading. What a superb composition. But then comes the
movie... Hollywood did an outstanding job moving the book to film. The
last time I enjoyed a book/film combination as much as this was for
""Get Shorty"". Well done Wambaugh! Thanks much.

The character development within the film is excellent with plenty of concentration on the major & minor players... one reason the movie is as long as it is. Some may complain, but one can't really appreciate how well this development supports the overall thrust of the movie without reading the book or watching the movie a second time.",1314489600,5,870,4.723684210526316
7979069,5,B0000844J7,This movie is incredible.  I loved the book but had not seen the movie in years.  It was as good as I remembered.,1254268800,7,113,3.869565217391304
7979070,4,B0000844J7,"For a goodly part of the late 20th Century, the writings and the resulting
movie and TV productions of Joseph Wambaugh helped define for the nation the world of police work and law enforcement.  It started with the book (and the resulting movie) THE NEW CENTURIANS, and then continued through a
TV series, [i]Police Story[/i], which then produced a couple of spin-offs
involving undercover work and a female detective.

THE BLACK MARBLE tells the story of a cash-strapped gambler (Harry Dean Stanton) who is in deep trouble with his bookie, and who gets in deeper when bets the wrong way on the (actual, historical) Super Bowl XIII. A dog trainer and groomer by profession, the gambler decides to solve his problems by kidnapping for ransom a prize show dog. Things go badly wrong starting with the fact that the dog's owner does not have the kind of money he needs if he is going to solve his problems.

The police detectives who catch the stolen dog case are flawed heros indeed.  The male detective (Robert Foxworth) has transferred out of Homicide Division because he has burned out on the suffering he's seen, and is pretty well gone into alcoholism.  The female detective (Paula Printiss) feels that her partner is a drag on her career ambitions, and she keeps trying to get rid of him.  She thinks she has her chance when
he says goodnight at end-of-shift, and says he's going home to fix himself a nice Christmas dinner.  It ia mid January.  She reports this conversation in hopes of having him releived of duty; the wiley squad
Sergeant, who rocks no boats, does some scrambling research and varifies that the detective is of the Russian Orthodox faith, which puts Christmas on a different calander.

This story has pathos, realism and humor.  Especially funny is the final scene with the unlucky gambler.  He flees the country, to Mexico, with a reduced ransom, after being mutilated by a Doberman in his care.  He passes out on the plane, wakes up in a Mexican hospital, among fascinated
locals who think they've met the new Charles Manson.

I am very happy with the quality of this purchase. An the prices I get at Amazon are quite satisfactory.",1239235200,4,2157,4.750670241286863
7979071,4,B0000844J7,"The Black Marble (1979)...as best as I can figure, the title refers to something that isn't desirable...like when a group of people are trying decide which member has to perform an unpleasant task, they may draw straws, the person picking the short straw being the one chosen...and if done a number of times in a row, there will probably be one individual more likely to get the short straw more often than the others...in the film we see three individuals, not one, who are more than likely to choose the black marble...based on a novel by Joseph Wambaugh (The New Centurions) and directed by Harold Becker (The Onion Field, Taps, Vision Quest), the film stars Robert Foxworth (Damien: Omen II), Paula Prentiss (Last of the Red Hot Lovers,), and Harry Dean Stanton (Cool Hand Luke, Rancho Deluxe).  Also appearing is Barbara Babcock (""Hill Street Blues"", Space Cowboys), John Hancock (Airplane II: The Sequel), and the buxom Judy Landers, whom I'll always remember as the character of `Stacks' (because of her ample breastage, get it?  Aw, fergit it...), from the 70's television show ""B.J. and the Bear"".

Foxworth, who looks like he could be Mike Brady's older brother, plays Sgt. A.M. Valnikov, a Los Angeles police detective currently working in Hollywood's robbery division, transferred from homicide after some unpleasantness which is later gone into with great detail (not later in this review, but later in the film).  Oh yeah, he's also got a problem with the booze...he can't get enough!  Har har...but seriously, this is a man who lives alone (with the exception of a parakeet and a gerbil), as wife left him a number of years ago, taking their son with her, and this, coupled with what happened to his last partner, seems to have deterioration, going through life as a shadow of a man, living in the continual state of either being drunk or hungover.  Prentiss plays Sgt. Natalie Zimmerman, a no nonsense, career driven detective assigned to be Valnikov's new partner, much to her dismay as she has little time for a burnt out, hungover, stumblebum, cop whose only interest seems to be finding the bottom of the next bottle of Russian potato juice, constantly making her objections know to their superiors.  The third player in this story, sort of outside the circle of Foxworth and Prentiss but tied in nonetheless, is Stanton, as Philo Skinner, The Terrier King, a dog groomer with a gambling problem...he can't get enough!  Okay, that's getting tired...but seriously, he owes a great deal of money to people you don't want to owe a great deal of money to, so he concocts a plan to kidnap a valuable show dog from a rich widow and hold it for a hefty ransom (the back of the DVD case states $84,000 but in the film it's $85,000...strange...minor typo, I guess).

This was a really odd sort of film...it reminded me a lot of an early 80's television show called Hill Street Blues in that it would try to do many things like trying to present humanistic characters in situations that might make you laugh or cry, and sometimes even shock you...the opening sequences would indicate this would perhaps be a comedy (Foxworth, in a drunken stupor, ends up accidentally handcuffing his own `privates'), but ends up evolving into a sort of love story, drama, and comedy.  Prentiss and Foxworth were an interesting pairing as Foxworth's character seemed a charming and affable type (when he wasn't blitzed) while Prentiss' character was, well, for lack of a better term, bitchy.  Okay, I know...if a woman asserts herself, she's often termed this way, but I'm not being chauvinistic here...she really presented this `put offish' attitude through a better portion of the film, but her position does soften, as you can actually see her falling for her partner, despite her fighting it...the two develop a sort of weird chemistry, but I think it worked.  My favorite performance was that by Stanton, with his chain smoking (he better get that cough checked out) and leisure suit attire.  He's so greasy, seedy and lecherous, sort of a psuedo-comic character, one on the verge of breakdown from excessive stresses...and has some of the more memorable scenes in the film in my opinion, one involving him using a public phone just outside a motel, and a heated exchange between him and the motel owner, played by Anne Ramsey (she played Momma from the Crystal/DeVito film Throw Momma from the Train), as she gets annoyed with Stanton's character hocking lung butter on her sidewalk.  Another scene near the end involves Philo and Valnikov in a really funny case of mistaken identity, resulting in one of the more bizarre chase sequences I've ever seen, with Stanton's character getting the worst of it, in my opinion (and the punishment shall fit the crime).  A third scene, one that doesn't feature Stanton but Prentiss and Foxworth interviewing a criminal named Itchy Mitch (he gets the hives whenever he gets arrested) was truly funny in a very subdued way.  Some will find the pacing to be on the slow and stilted side (the film runs almost an hour and 50 minutes), especially some of the `interactive' scenes between Prentiss and Foxworth, but if you're a patient sort and enjoy character driven stories, this may appeal to you.  The film does have some a little bit of harsh language and a couple of rather shockingly violent scenes (both involving Stanton's character), so I wouldn't recommend this for everyone.  Also, keep an eye out for some cameos by Michael Dudikoff (American Ninja), in his first on screen role, Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future), and James Woods (Videodrome), as The Fiddler.

The Anchor Bay DVD features an anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs, looking very good, and the 2.0 Dolby Digital audio comes through cleanly.  Special features include a reproduction of the original theatrical poster on the inside, a trailer, and a commentary track by director Harold Becker.
