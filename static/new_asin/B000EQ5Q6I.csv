2527500,5,B000EQ5Q6I,An amazing story --- don't know how he did it.  I would recommend it to EVERYONE,1236124800,2,80,4.0
2527501,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Having read the book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" by Aron Ralston, I wanted to see the video of his story.  It was a very touching piece by a man who has been transformed.  Things happen in life that can make or break a person.  Aron was made new by his experience, and the energy comes across as he talks about his time in the canyon.",1229040000,6,340,3.9705882352941178
2527502,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Awesome movie. I read the book, than decided on getting this video as well.  Wow, it really feels like your their with him and what's going on. You also have a better prespective of how small the canyon was that he was in. Highly recommend if you like this type of adventure.",1211673600,2,275,4.288461538461538
2527503,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Gripping, inspiring, shocking, amazing.  We three adults sat stunned, riveted by this tv broadcast.  Equipped with a VIDEO CAMERA, Aron filmed his extreme situation; he suffered, fought back, resigned himself, considered the worst, thought about his family, the good life he was leaving, what would have/could have been, apologized, said his good-byes and thank yous, found unbelievable strength and courage, and, barely, survived.  And so, we are able to follow his incredible ordeal in real-time.  This young man is out of mythology; in former times, he would have been one of those storybook heroes.  What qualities make up such a man?  Sheer physical strength?  Will power?  Intelligence?  Confidence? Determination? Solid upbringing? Strong, loving family background?  An unforgettable video, well worth watching.",1196467200,10,818,5.68595041322314
2527504,4,B000EQ5Q6I,"Between Tom Brokaw's video and Aron Ralston's book, Tom does a much better job of giving us the heart of Aron's brush with death without getting pulled away by distracting details.

Aron's story of being pinned at the right wrist by an ""800-pound boulder"" and having to amputate his own hand to save his life, gripped the nation when it first hit the airwaves.  The original NBC broadcast of this video is what led me to purchase Aron's stinker of a book.

If you are curious enough to want to purchase a professionally edited story, then this this DVD is for you.  Avoid Aron Ralston's book, which suffers both from major plot divergences and poor writing.

If you simply cannot live without paying for the details of Aron's stunning fight for survival, then start and end with the NBC video.",1153699200,3,793,4.635714285714286
2527505,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Mountain climber Aron Ralston found himself trapped in a narrow canyon, arm pinned down by an 800 pound boulder. He was faced with a choice - die there in the ravine, or cut off his trapped arm and hope he could survive his escape. This feature-length NBC News documentary, reported by Tom Brokaw, lays out Ralston's story --  as he faces his horrible decision; as loved ones back home try to figure out what has happened to him; and as rescuers try to reach him in time. Stunningly shot on location, using everything from tiny cameras in small spaces to helicopters delivering panoramic scenes of natural beauty, ""Survivor: Aron Ralston"" is a real life thriller that bests anything Hollywood could do.",1141689600,17,702,4.801652892561983
8112695,4,B000EQ5Q6I,"Well told no frills.  I like that it's less ""Hollywood"" than other accounts I've seen.",1417392000,,86,4.733333333333333
8112696,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Years ago, I caught the end of this documentary with Tom Brokaw on TV.  The movie (127 hours) did not do Aron's story justice.  His book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, is very well written and engaging.  If you aren't going to read the book (or if you did), this NBC documentary is the real deal.  You get a brief feel for who Aron is and what he faced.  You see where he was trapped.  You see him overcome by descending Blue John Canyon with one arm only 6 months after he made it out.  It is a gripping tale told by the one who experienced it, interviewed by one of the best newsmen of the past century.",1388707200,,608,4.016666666666667
8112697,5,B000EQ5Q6I,We used this in a study at church.  It was easy to determine where to start and stop each segment. Shipped quickly.,1379462400,,115,4.2272727272727275
8112698,4,B000EQ5Q6I,I really like this documentary. Amazing story.  Students really get into this one!  Can be used for so many different purposes!,1374969600,,127,5.0
8112699,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"This featured the real Aron Ralston and his story of survival. It was very horrible what he went through. But you can see when he revisits the place where it happened how much strength he has. I still can't imagine what he went through but this is his story in his own words. All I can say after watching this documentary is this man never gave up,had incredible courage and a strong will to live. I highly recommend this documentary.",1370736000,,434,4.4375
8112700,5,B000EQ5Q6I,I teach a literature unit on Adventure and Survival. We read Into Thin Air and I wanted something a little more current and realistic for my students.  This was perfect. I love the reality as Aron retraces his steps.  My students connected to the story and several choose to do their reading/research project on Aron. Certainly a win-win in our classroom,1368835200,,354,4.786885245901639
8112701,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"Everyone should see this story as it is actually re-enacted by Aron.  Some of the film is during
the real time that he was trapped under the rock.  Well done show, well worth watching.
After seeing this tv film, I saw Aron on the tv show ""minute to win it"" 10 years after his
accident, he is married and does have a little boy that he had a vision of while he was trapped
in the cave.",1356566400,,384,3.9740259740259742
8112702,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"great documentary, inspiring story. a tribute to the survivor spirit. also teaches the importance of following established safety practices when traveling in back country areas solo or with others.",1312416000,,197,5.827586206896552
8112703,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"i loved this interview!  interview isn't even the right word, it was a touching trip back to a scary place.  i saw the movie, read the book, and was going to buy the dvd of 127 hours and came across this.
priceless",1311724800,2,214,4.071428571428571
8112704,5,B000EQ5Q6I,"I just finished watching this, and  having seen 127 hours was wondering how a documentary could be.  All I can say is this is my favorite documentary ever, besides Restrepo.  This captured what he was going through, his feelings and what he had to face clearly, and even knowing what happens, you still find yourself hoping for the best for him.  It's amazing what he was able to do while starved, dehydrated and in shock-he must have an iron constitution to go through what he did and come out of it intact.  In the video you can see that attitude, when the host gets help, but Aron insists on doing everything himself,which shows the same attitude which saved him.  If you liked 127 hours, I recommend this.",1311465600,4,709,4.543307086614173
