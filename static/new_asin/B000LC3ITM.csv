8161354,5,B000LC3ITM,"My 11 year old grandson walks 5 blocks home from school.  This video includes just the self-defense moves I want him to know...what to do if someone grabs your hair, grabs you from behind, and other moves to help him be able to get away from dangerous people.  I hope he never has to use any of the moves.  He lives in a small, relatively safe town, but you never know.  My 5 year old grandson practices with him.  Everybody needs to know how to get away, and this video will show you how.  I'm a grandma, and I even learned the defenses.",1268611200,5,538,4.174757281553398
