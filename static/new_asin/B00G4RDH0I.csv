8620711,5,B00G4RDH0I,"Lewis and Clark as it could have been. Shaquinna (Lisa Barbuscia) with Bartholomew Hunt and Leslie Edwards are challenged to beat Lewis and Clark to the Pacific. They face many challenges form bears, eagles and the mad conquistador, Hidalgo (Kevin Dunn.) Will they do so? And at what cost?
This movie consists of many comic scenes and slapstick sketches. The main theme is held together by Lisa, who plays the counter part of Sacagawea. She would not look bad on the golden dollar either.",1500854400,,488,4.821428571428571

8620713,5,B00G4RDH0I,"Is this movie dumb? You bet! But I love it. The dumber ""the better"" I always say. Well sometimes. Farley and Perry play off each other quite well with their own styles of comedic humor in this interpretation of the Lewis and Clark exploration. But then so does the whole cast of zany characters in this whimsical historical tale. Some of the situations and lines of dialog are absolutely stupid, but they are just so funny in their own way. After I recently viewed this film again I just thought it was absolutely gut wrenching funny and worth the 5 stars. It is still funny.",1414713600,,575,4.485714285714286
