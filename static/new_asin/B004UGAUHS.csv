4467190,5,B004UGAUHS,"If you are into Kiefer's work and have wondered: how does he do this, this beautifully made documentary lets you have a glimpse of how this man conceives, develops and executes his work. Awe inspiring, just like le Myst&egrave;re Picasso.",1364774400,,238,4.975
4467191,5,B004UGAUHS,"Just saw this film in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the Center for Contemporary Arts. It is BRILLIANT, as is the artist himself. Came to Amazon to buy a copy....none available for our region as yet. SEE it, buy it, rent it. Fabulous.",1316044800,4,227,4.3023255813953485

8441515,2,B004UGAUHS,"I have to say that as a visual documentation of an artist's work this documentary is successful, but as far as providing knowledge about Kiefer's work it is a pretentious failure. It is astounding to look at but provides so little information about the work or the artist I even went to the extras on the DVD hoping for a commentary track or further information of some sort (only to be disappointed to find nothing).

When I watch a documentary about any artwork I expect to be at least somewhat educated by the watching of it. This is basically like walking through Kiefer's art with a camera and annoying ""music"" accompanying me. No explanations, no insights, no education, nothing...just the art (and an annoying soundtrack).

I've never been so fascinated and so frustrated at the same time when watching a documentary about an artist's work.",1436400000,5,847,4.834482758620689
8441516,4,B004UGAUHS,"Beautifully filmed and documenting beautiful work, but frankly even as a scholar of art and avid art world follower, I found it to get a bit boring towards the end of the second half. It is beautiful though, and would be great to have on in the background continuously just for the looks (for those of us who can't afford one of Kiefer's real works). What it documents well beyond his work and the site, is his relationship with his artist assistants and how the work truly comes about.",1417219200,4,486,4.47191011235955
8441517,5,B004UGAUHS,"Great buy- a fantastic overview of his work. I wish it had more footage of him creating the art though.  Either way, an exceptional, moving documentary that helped me know more about one of my favorite artists.",1397520000,,210,4.675675675675675
8441518,5,B004UGAUHS,"Excellent film that gives a great insight into the working process and experience of Kiefer's work. I was hoping for a bit more information coming from the artist himself, but he leaves most of his motives and thought processes a mystery, despite an interview in the film (Kiefer seemed to be toying a bit with the interviewer as opposed to giving straight answers...). On the upside, his work remains as vast and powerful as ever, and we are left to research his subjects (kabbalism, Lilith, etc) and draw our own interpretations. I bought the film intending not just to watch and enjoy it, but to show it to my high school art classes. Alas, it is over the head of the average student due to the fore-knowledge needed to unlock Kiefer's work, and the slow pacing. I would reserve it only for very advanced H.S. or college students.",1389830400,,833,4.635135135135135
8441519,5,B004UGAUHS,"I loved this movie because I am so impressed with the way Anselm Kiefer can create an entire environment with his art. Everything he does is so profound and his art is so visceral and physical one cannot help but be completely moved by it. It is beautiful, ghastly, and  compelling at the same time.",1377216000,3,299,4.4363636363636365
8441520,5,B004UGAUHS,I have just recently visited Barjac and had a chance to see Kiefer's studio (which he has since left) in person - this DVD does a great job of capturing the spirit of Kiefer's massive space and the work (both the space itself and the pieces contained in this space). Highly recommended. *****,1373587200,,292,4.528301886792453
