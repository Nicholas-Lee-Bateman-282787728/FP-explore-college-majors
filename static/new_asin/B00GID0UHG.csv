8623529,5,B00GID0UHG,"I am 52 but am in good shape. I practice barre, pilates, and walk regularly. I've tried other yoga dvd's but was discouraged that not enough time and instruction was given to develop proper form for the poses. This set is perfect. Ashley is the instructor on two of the dvd's and she gives very thorough instruction throughout. The Yoga for beginners dvd instructor is Elena Brower. It is good, but not great.",1456617600,19,409,4.616438356164384
