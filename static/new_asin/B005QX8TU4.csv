8483897,4,B005QX8TU4,"This 2010 German sci-fi movie, made for German television, came out in the U. S. of A. and France a year before its release in 2011 in Germany itself. It is based on a story which the rolling credits cite as Elio Barcel's ""Tausend Euro, ein Leben"", even if in the film (in French and the English subtitles), at least, the ageing, wealthy married couple talk of paying a figure of one million for the bodies which they take over with the help of the Menzana Corporation's technology. There is a short but informative entry on Wikipedia's French Web site explaining the synopsis and most other matters. The North American edition viewed, from Mongrel Media (or simply "" Mo' "") DVD-4743, was one in French, with English subtitles.

The old white couple purchases two Africans, a man from Mali, a woman from Ethiopia, in order to have their personalities and memories transferred (hence the title) or, in computer language, ""downloaded"", into the young Africans, who, in return, have part of the sum for their purchase sent on the to their impoverished families back in Africa (although some financial scam comes to light, to the distress of all four). The ageing couple takes on these robustly beauteous Africans, for twenty hours of each day, but the black couple have four hours during nighttime in which they regain their own conscious minds for their own use. There is hostility between the old couple inhabiting these beautiful, physically perfect bodies and the host Africans, the latter scheming to resume their own bodies again full time. The Menzana Corporation scientist catches them in their attempt to carry out their scheme, but the old white-souled couple forgives them. The surprise (not to reveal here, to avoid a ""spoiler"") is that what both couples desire to do to set things aright does not come to pass, with the grimly weird resulting twist of fate at film's conclusion.

It takes some concentration to follow this story (obviously a nightmare scenario for medical ethics, at least of the 20th and early 21st centuries!). After all, the tale concerns four people in two black bodies and two of them also, off and on, in old white bodies as well. The French Wikipedia article helps the viewer to sort things out, not in great detail, but adequately enough to avoid losing his way. The conflicts of white souls in black bodies, but their prejudices initially intact, and of black resentment of rich whites, adds another layer of ironically racist and some moral tensions to the story. Then there is the question of which couple sharing the young black bodies has fathered the child with which the female black body becomes pregnant!

The film obtains glossy results on what, when one thinks about it, must have been a rather limited budget, but one which does not show its inexpensive seams. As one can tell, there is a lot of narrative and many conflicting values packed into the movie's screenplay, which adds up to some engrossing and frequently disconcerting viewing for those who watch this tart specimen of science fiction.",1436054400,3,3045,4.874517374517374
