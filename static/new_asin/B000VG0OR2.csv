2941454,5,B000VG0OR2,"I love this workout routine. I'm new to working out, and I also get bored with workout videos. So far this is my 4th week and I'm not bored yet. I've noticed a lot of muscle tightening and definition in my arms and legs. I have recommended it to all of my friends and family because it is very difficult (when you workout 5 times a week) but yet doable, which is what I like, I feel like I've really accomplished something when I'm done with a workout...I didn't buy the CardioWeights with my DVD set, I just use ones I have at home and they work just fine.

8218585,5,B000VG0OR2,I have always been a fan of the firm.  The workouts are just right for me.,1469059200,,74,3.625
8218586,3,B000VG0OR2,"After doing several FIRM workouts, I expected a certain level of intensity from them. This was a little disappointing. It's good if you're just starting to work out, but if you've been doing so for a while you may find it too easy and repetitive. I save it for days when I'm tired, but still want to workout. There are three DVDs that alternate between aerobic and strength, and one that's purely aerobic.",1465776000,,405,4.561643835616438

8218588,3,B000VG0OR2,I bought the firm workout with weights several years ago. I wanted to start working out again and purchased this as it had the same workouts as the one I had used several years ago. I would have given higher rating but one of the workout discs skips.( But I did buy that disc separately by itself. Glad I did because it is my favorite workout.),1435536000,,344,4.2272727272727275

8218590,5,B000VG0OR2,Cardio Overdrive & Hard Core Fusion are good cardio workout with intervals of weight toning.  Hi-def sculpt is all toning & cardio party is all cardio.  I love to use weights with my cardio & really enjoy all these workouts.  Most have someone for beginners to follow & can be done without weights.  I love that all but cardio party have an express version (20-30 minutes) for when I'm short on time.  Nothing is too hard & the instructors do a good job of showing you how to do the moves.  Most workout even have a chapter that show you some of the moves before you begin.  Good all body workouts.,1375315200,3,598,4.333333333333333
8218591,5,B000VG0OR2,"All these DVDs are great.  They provide a great mix of ""The Firm"" moves in different workouts that really get you in shape.  It's the variety I was looking for.",1282435200,4,160,4.3
8218592,5,B000VG0OR2,"The FIRM has changed a lot over the years.  The VHS videos used to cost $50.  Well, thank goodness that has changed!  These DVD's were a fraction of that.  Yes, the workouts have changed too; these are less intense and shorter.",1281398400,2,227,4.463414634146342
8218593,5,B000VG0OR2,"I own about 20 Firm DVDs, so I think I'm qualified to say this one is great! A little bit of dance with a lot of cardio and sculpting. You get four different work outs for a super low price, along with the option of express workout on each DVD, which is a shorter version of the regular workout when you're short on time. Challenging, yet easy enough to follow. If it's too easy for you, just pick up heavier weights or up your own intensity level. No need for a step either, which makes it nice for those who don't own one. Have fun!",1269907200,10,534,4.095238095238095
