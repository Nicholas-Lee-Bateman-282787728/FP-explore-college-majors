7758932,5,B01G8S1UTC,"Otto Preminger, the great humanist that he was, had wanted to reach the youth audience again after ""Skidoo"" with its rather far out screenplay by Doran William Cannon (""Brewster McCloud"") decided to make the film version of Marjorie Kellogg's sensitive novel, ""Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon.""  The screenplay by Kellogg was directed by Otto, as with all of his directorial efforts, has a sense of economy (his films were always brought in on time and under budget) and some that are so good, that it seems the novel has been brought to life.  This seems to be a successful venture that I can compare only other to Luchino Visconti's film of Camus's ""The Stranger"" that Camus's estate demanded that it adhere strictly to the way it was written, to Visconti's regret.  Liza Minnelli is very effective in a beguiling role of ""Junie Moon,"" disfigured by battery acid.  Ken Howard plays an epileptic, and Robert Moore, a homosexual paraplegic.  James Coco is also in the cast, as is Fred Williamson in a role that one must appreciate Preminger's daring, and an old Preminger veteran, Anne Revere has a role.  The fact that ""Warren,"" the homosexual spends a successful night with a young black woman seems to me to be pushing the limits, but I do not remember how this was handled in Kellogg's book initially.  But Otto's handling of ""Arthur's"" (Ken Howard) delusions and skewered flashbacks to the State facility he was confined in as a youngster are handled brilliantly.  Preminger bookends his film with Pete Seeger singing his ""Old Devil Time"" that is interwoven in the film's soundtrack by Philip Springer, and the song is a perfect blending here.  Boris Kaufman did the cinematography. The film is in Technicolor and was originally a Paramount film given a fine Blu-ray and DVD treatment by Olive Films.",1473897600,8,1810,4.85064935064935

8762518,3,B01G8S1UTC,"This is an odd film by Otto Preminger and not one I'd expect from a director with epic features like In Harm's Way, Advise and Consent, Exodus, and The Cardinal. It's an ensemble piece about three people suffering from different ailments who form a friendship in the hospital and try to live together in the outside world. Junie Moon's scars are explained in flashback and her backstory is especially horrific.

Mostly, I enjoyed the chemistry between Junie Moon, Arthur, and Warren. For me, the weakest part of the movie was when they go off on a vacation paid for by the lonely fish seller (James Coco). Rather than take this detour, the film should have continued with the development of the trio at home. It seemed that their struggles were solved a little too easily. For example, Junie Moon manages to convince a wealthy landlady to rent to them just by talking to her on the phone. Not very convincing.

The film manages to avoid being maudlin until the very end. I admit I had tears, but afterwards, thought it wasn't earned enough and somehow felt it was all rushed. As a result, it seemed more like a pilot to a TV series.

Overall, I liked the film and its characters, but wouldn't consider it a must-see.",1485129600,,1216,4.594470046082949

8762523,5,B01G8S1UTC,"I have been so happy to have found some of Liza's earlier films being released onto DVD format. This one was late in the offering, and I had to purchase this movie before it is not available again. Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon is a wonderfully fast paced movie based on the lives of three ""misfits"" who find each other and form a lifetime friendship pact together as a way to survive. Each one has their own little history of how they got to be a patient at the hospital that they meet at and form their plans to live together after each is discharged. It is funny, quirky at times though believably so, and tender and endearing. It never lags in action or change of story line from one character to the next. I fell in love with each of the characters and wanted to be a part of their world forever. Liza shows us her acting is superb and fun to watch in this movie. It is a shame, I think, that she starred in and won the Academy Award in ""Cabaret"" because her reaching stardom status deprived the movie public of what possibilities as an actress, without the singing, she could have shown us in more small budget B movies with other newly up and coming actors such as in this film. I loved this movie. I loved Liza's warmth.  I would have loved to have seen her in more vulnerable love stories. She is a star in so many ways. This movie is a classic in my book that I will cherish and view at least once a year as one of my favorites that will be endlessly loved and special to watch. All of the supporting cast gave it a unique quality and ensemble that all came together and to make a movie that is lovable, lovably unique, and fun to watch. It will stay with you for days after the movie ends. I highly recommend buying this movie. Thankfully, we American Liza fans have it on DVD from Amazon.",1474156800,5,1807,4.192528735632184
