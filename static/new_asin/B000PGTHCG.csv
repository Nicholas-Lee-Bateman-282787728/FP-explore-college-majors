8552695,4,B000PGTHCG,Wow! Classic. This takes me back. There used to be a law that independent movies had to have super hip dialogue. They don't make them like this any more. I wish they did.,1528848000,,170,4.181818181818182
8552696,5,B000PGTHCG,"I couldn't help but feel like I was back in the town I grew up in as I watched this film. A place where psychos proliferate, at a time when girls wore stockings and over-sized ties like they're supposed to, and it was hot, baby, hot. Rock and roll ruled the world, with Country/Western finishing second by a Florida count.

The first time I saw The Faithful and the Foul, I thought it was a good film. It was well acted, it had fun (sometimes surreal!) scenes, and it was creative. Better than most, I thought, and a great soundtrack, too - I ended up buying the DVD because I had to hear the songs again. The rock and roll songs are like good medicine that makes you feel better and the C/W songs are a hoot!

Anyway, it wasn't until the second time I watched it that I began to appreciate how clever the film is. The obsessions and behaviors of everyone involved all end up connected in one way or another and those moments of realization make for some good entertainment. Sometimes you have to ask yourself if the connection is intentional or accidental, and I can see why the film is being categorized as cult or cult classic.

The Faithful and the Foul is mostly a fun ride, like an earthquake, but at a really cool party. A good stocking stuffer for the stalker in your family.",1198108800,3,1283,4.3375
