8656267,1,B00K6FP2UC,"Oh MY God...I saw that Francis Ford Coppola was involved in this from 1959. it was painful. The actors and actresses looked to be regular people they found on the street, there is the one star after that...the performances were appalling, the sets? did they cost more than $11.50? The soundtrack was distracting. The plot was horrific. Don't be sucked in by FFC's name, run away. I understand it was early in his career but OUCH!",1404777600,,429,4.657894736842105
