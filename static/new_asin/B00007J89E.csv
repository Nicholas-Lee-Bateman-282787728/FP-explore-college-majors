1811722,3,B00007J89E,"After September 11, it's hard to reconcile the fear, hate and anti-Muslim bigotry with the seemingly beautiful religion of Mohammed as presented in INSIDE ISLAM.
Jews, Christian and Moslems -- the so called ""People of the Book"" -- share a common ancestry with Abraham (about 2500 BC).  Not only that, but Jesus, Mary and even the angel Gabriel are prominently featured in the Quran.
In the Bible, God makes a promise of to Abraham's seed -- that both Isaac and Ishmael would become a great nation.  They did, but a blood feud became religious and now, they still hate each other all under God's name.
Two thousand plus years after Abraham, Jesus said, ""Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.""  Maybe that's the only solution to a world engulfed in this very real spiritual war -- a blood-soaked jihad. An information war, if you will, that's increasingly over who God is and who's God rules -- the oil.",1048464000,19,913,4.658385093167702
1811753,2,B00007J89E,"Being a History Channel production, this seems aimed at mass of people who know some other religion and want to know what they could learn if they stepped inside Islamic world.

That said, I have traveled in the Islamic world and have good insight into various aspects of Islam from study and Islamic friends.  I was teaching a high school course on comparative religion and wanted something to broaden student understanding.

This film has beautiful imagery and does cover the basics of rise of Islam including divisions and such.  But, it was a puff piece more geared to avoid offending with anything that might trouble followers of Islam in my view.  I've seen similar pieces on Christianity from History Channel that included darker aspects including violence of Reformation, oppression of Jews and Muslims in Inquisitions, pogroms, oppression of women, sale of indulgences, crusades, etc.

I expect as an educator a product that is honest and allows students to learn a more complete story and allow them to thus grow.

Perhaps for a middle school audience this piece would be useful.  Otherwise, this video is too biased for teaching or anyone to learn what to expect inside history of Islam.",1356825600,4,1198,4.984924623115578
1811754,5,B00007J89E,"Even if you know a few things about Islam, you will learn something from this well-made documentary that traces Islam from its beginnings to the present. If that seems like a lot of territory to cover (almost 1400 years), it is. But the History Channel has put together a clear, fact-filled narrative that discusses the basic beliefs of Muslims and the long history of their religion. Expert commentators are religion scholars from the Islamic, Christian, and Judaic faith traditions. The film, produced in 2002 at the height of Americans' curiosity and alarm about Muslims following 9/11, confronts fear and stereotype by drawing important distinctions between the broad territory of this world religion (the very name of which, Islam, is derived from the Arabic word for peace, salaam) and those who distort the character of their religion by carrying out acts of violence in its name.

It focuses almost exclusivly on the positive aspects of Islam without confronting the equally real--and very negative--side of this religion.

I let a few watch it and they had nothing but good things to say about it. I also shared waht I learned with other Iraqis and there were very impressed with what I learned from this video. This video is also very unbiased, a huge plus. This video also shows a great respect for the religion becaus it never shows or depicts the Prophet Mohammed in any way (it is forbidden in Islam to show any images of Muhammed).

1811761,3,B00007J89E,"""Inside Islam"" was produced within a year of the 9/11 attacks, with the goal of educating Americans about this often misunderstood faith.  In some ways, I'd say it was successful, but in others, it fell short.

It does explain the origins of Islam and the story of the prophet Muhammad, who founded the religion and guided it in its early days.  The viewer also learns about the ""Five Pillars of Islam,"" the split between Shia and Sunni, some of the golden ages enjoyed by Islamic empires, and some of the contributions those societies gave to the world.  (And for those viewers who might have been wondering, there is even a brief explanation of the American group The Nation of Islam and its most famous disciple, Malcom X.)  With roughly 1400 years of Islamic history, there is a lot to cover in 100 minutes, so I would say the producers did a decent job in the time alotted.

On the other hand, I felt some areas would have benefitted from more analysis.  Altough some time was spent on the Shia/Sunni split, it could have been explored in more detail, both in the 7th century and the realities of that split today.  Even more importantly, the topic of Islam's link to terrorism was woefully under-reported.  Although it was stressed that Islamic doctrine does not advocate violence and forbids suicide (defied by today's suicide bombers), there was not enough of a discussion about why these terrorist factions exist.  Why is Al Qaeda targeting the west?  What policies have western governments pursued that have angered them?  Etc. etc.  This was a serious missed opportunity that would have helped Americans to understand what is happening in the larger world beyond our shores.

Three stars.  Helps the viewer understand Islam but falls short of explaining how it is used by terrorists to justify their actions.",1224892800,19,1819,4.841423948220065
1811762,4,B00007J89E,"This is a very informative presentation on Islam.  It presents the formative history of the religion.  There is an attempt to draw out similarities between Islam, Christianity and the Jewish faiths.  It does not put forth a clear distinction of how they are different and the implications of those distinctions.  The photography and editing of this work are excellent. The History Channel did a great job of editing and interviewing a number of people, but I felt it could have been more effective and scholarly, should they have included prominate orthodox Christian scholars in the discussion.  Some of those who they did interview seemed to miss the overwhelming significance of when someone does not believe that Jesus is both fully God and fully human.  Another perspective is that the DVD does not emphasize the centuries of Islam's hostility toward Jews that is the hallmark of its impact in the middle east.  They do not well treat the absolute prohibition of conversion to either the Jewish or Christian faith by Islam's adherents and the inevitable consequence of castigation and even death when someone chooses to do so.  One could easily watch the program and come away with the idea that it is one of the three great peacable religions of the world, of equal merrit, just different, from the other to major religions.  It postures that Islam is simply a new revelation of the same faith of the same God which originated with the Jews, was further revealed in Christanity, and reached its even more fuller revelation in Islam.  This might be a Muslim perspective but would never be that of either orthodox Jews or orthodox Christians. I would recommend it, but leave the caution that it is not as exhaustive in its research as I would like to have seen.",1202428800,4,1765,4.8533333333333335
1811802,5,B00007J89E,"Highly recommend this DVD.  It opens your eyes to true Islam and not the hype with the terrorists, by the way according to the infomation on this DVD are the infadels!! They are going totally against the teaching of the Koran.  They need to re-learn their own religion.  They have made up their own rules.  The Koran teaches peace, fairness, equality, generousity, and a love of education.  The terrorists are against all of that!!  The Koran teaches respect of life and only to defend, it teaches that killing of women, children and civilians is WRONG!  I don't know what the terrorists are following, but they should not claim it is Islam!!
They bring shame to a very honorable and respectable religion!  It brought a lot to our civilization and has made many valuable contributions to a human kind.  The terrorists are doing their best to bring shame to this great religion and because (like me) the general public don't know the true teachings, we re-act in fear and hatred.  But if everyone viewed this DVD and learned the true teachings, they would understand that true Muslims are valuable and the terrorists are FAKES!  Keep an open mind until you get the true facts!!",1182902400,2,1176,4.74384236453202
1811803,4,B00007J89E,"Inside Islam was released in 2002 in the aftermath of 9/11 to educate non-Muslims about Islam.  The documentary clearly explains which relationships exist among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Inside Islam also highlights the key events in the life of Prophet Mohammed.  Furthermore, the documentary covers the five traditional pillars of Islam, the much misunderstood Jihad, the essential contribution of Islam to the Western Renaissance, and the history of Islam from the 7th century CE until the beginning of the 21st century CE.

Despite its merits in painting Islam in a generally positive light, Inside Islam does not highlight enough the multiple contradictions existing within the Qur'an.  The Tanakh and Holy Bible are not exempted either from these contradictions.  The Qur'an has given a small, but influential minority of Islam practitioners the rhetorical firepower to justify the most barbarous acts against other human beings.

For example, Surah II, 256, mentions: ""Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from error: Whoever rejects Evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that never breaks."" Referring to Christians and Jews, Surah III, 113, mentions: ""Of the People of the Book are a portion that stand (for the right); they rehearse the signs of God all night long, and they prostrate themselves in adoration.""  Surah III, 116, continues: ""Those who reject Faith neither their possessions nor their (numerous) progeny will avail them aught against God: They will be companions of the Fire, dwelling therein (for ever).""

Terrorism cannot be successfully contained only through military means.  Moderate Muslims have a key role to play in acknowledging these contradictions and marginalizing the minority of Muslims who cannot practice Islam peacefully.",1178496000,7,1825,5.485714285714286
1811804,4,B00007J89E,"I thought this was a good intro to Islam.  I do agree with what a few of the others said tho, they do mention the whole 9/11 aspect and that it was Muslims who did it.  I see it this way, the people behind the WTC attack and Pentagon attack ""claim"" to be Muslim, but they are not.  A Moslem would not think to attack someone like that; they would not think to attack anyone at all.  The Koran is pretty clear on what does and does not constitute acceptable actions.  Starting a war simply because you are jealous of what someone else has is not a good way to influence people that your cause is just.

Any rate, good show.  The presentation was well done.  They don't try to overwhelm you with the information, yet they try to tell you what you need to know.",1169424000,6,758,4.1438356164383565
1811805,4,B00007J89E,"""Inside Islam"" is a 2002 documentary that provides a good introduction to Islam. I've used excerpts from it in teaching world religions to undergraduates and high school students. Topics include Islam's connections with Judaism and Christianity, the life of Muhammad, the Five Pillars of Islam (the profession of faith, prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca), the history of Islam, women in Islam, European colonialism, Islamism, the Nation of Islam, and jihad.

While this documentary may not provide an entirely balanced picture of Islam (leaning heavily toward the positive), if you're looking to get a basic literacy in Islam--to understand what the central practices are, who Muhammad is, and a bit of the history of Islam--I'd highly recommend this video.

I see that the other reviewers think it was biased. The point of the film was to introduce islam to people who don't know anything about it. I thought it was a wonderful film. It was not biased. The things ommitted had cause to be left out, because not all muslims share in the beliefs(Such as death penalty, that is not in the Quran!!!). The complexities can not be explained in one single film. I thought it was a very nice introduction, and quite accurate. I have been studying a lot on Islam and I definitely recommend this DVD.

1811809,1,B00007J89E,"The movie doesnt seem to mention some key elements of Islam.  THe Koran states that 'Take no christians or Jews as friends'.  How is that peaceloving.  THe documentary doesnt mention the widespread oppresion of women in Islam.  Bill Mar siad it best when he asked ""if a woman in Syria or Iran call the police and says 'my husband is beating me' the police will say 'and your point is?'"".  This book alse leaves otu any critique of Islam like critiques regarding the enslavement of Afircans in the Sudan and Mauritania and also the widespread atrocities committed in the name of Islam in Eastern Europe.  The movie is far to biased and not ane xploration rather it is a film that seeks to convert us to this 'fastest gorwing world religion'.
A bunch of lies.  A total fabrication of the reality.  Most documentaries of christianity mention the crusades so why cant we have some balance here and have this film mention the outright oppression of minorites in all islamic societies?
Is it a lie that in Afghanistan and Nigeria and Iran under Sharia law that Women are oppressed, not allowed out of the house and not allowed to go to college and that they must eb covered head to toe regardless of wheher they want to or not.  Islam opposes abortion, something not mentioned in the film.  Islam supports the ddeath penalty, also not mentioned.

Such misrepresentations and attempts to censor the truth are irresponsible, at best, as they influence peoples' potentially life saving decisions (e.g. a neighbor of the San Bernardino murderers refrained from calling the authorities on the Muslim couple before the massacre because she was afraid of being accused of ""racial profiling""; had she called, and a cursory search been performed where a cache of bomb making materials and weapons were strewn through the house, 36 people would not have been shot, 14 of whom would still be alive).

7976705,5,B00007J89E,"It is the second largest religion in the world, and the fastest growing. Islam, which comes from the root peace, is now recognized by terror. Inside Islam, unveils the mystery of a terribly misunderstood faith. The movie goes back to the early roots of the Hebrew Bible and explains how the Five Pillars, Islams fundamental practices, assisted in the spreading of the religion to the rest of the world. Here we find out what the Quran, the holy texts, say about violence, suicide and war, and how extremists have assimilated these words. Along with these, specialists like Khaled Abou el Fadl, the author of Speaking in Gods Name, dig deeper into the challenges that Islam is facing today. This documentary is intended to transform the U.Ss views on Islam, in order for them to realize the similarities between the doctrine and their preferable religion of Christianity.

Inside Islam proclaims that Islam is a harmonious, humane, and understanding religion, regardless of the brutality subsumed in its name. The movie contrasts the beliefs of violent acts that are known to all the ignorant people around the world with the writings inside the Quran. Akbar S. Ahmed, Chair of Islamic Studies at American University, describes how the terrorist attack committed on September 11, 2001 has nothing to do with the peaceful teachings of Islam. He says, Here we have a hijacker committing suicide, taking lives of people, violating the Quran, twice over.(Inside Islam) The Quran strictly prohibits the killing of other people and suicide, so a question many of us failed to ask our selves after the crash was, if these people were really doing these acts under the name of Allah, why would they violate the Quran? Its questions like these that could spare the ostracizing of millions of Muslims around the globe.

The Jihad is another concept that arose during the documentary. The original and greater meaning of Jihad is the inner struggle to rid yourself of desire, somewhat like the teachings of Buddhism.  The lesser Jihad however, is the one everyone seems to designate when talking about Islam, the struggle against an enemy, in other words killing everyone that doesnt believe in Islam. Its unfortunate to see many non-Muslims all over the world, no longer being to recognize the true meaning of Islam versus what other Muslims have done. Reverend Charles Kimball, Chair of the Religion Department at Wake Forest University clarifies, Even though people know there are a lot of things the Christians have done, they tend to talk about the teachings of Jesus as though that somehow represents Christianity, not what Christians have actually done. Then they look at Islam and don't know what the Quran says or what Mohammed taught through his sayings and actions, but see the behaviour of extremists and think that represents Islam. (Inside Islam) It saddens me to think that the overall representation of Islam is based on the acts of extremists. A crucial difference between Christianity and Islam is, Islam is able to acknowledge their wrongdoings during the creation of their religion and use their history in order to teach their people not to repeat it. Christianity however, ignores all their immorality in order to show that they are purely good. Little do they know though, that thats what shapes their beliefs.

The movie makes the important point however, that the establishment of Islam drastically improved the rights of many women. After all, before Islam, many young women that were born in Arab countries were tortured and killed just for being female. The Quran however, grants women the right to own property, to receive an inheritance, to have choice on who they marry and divorce, and the right to vote way before any Western countries. The concept of a Hijab has become an image of oppression towards women to many outside countries, when its actually just a cultural way of life and supposed to signify humility before God. Amina Wadud, Professor of Islam at Virginia Commonwealth University expands, Islam was never meant to be a religion that oppresses women Its manipulated by people who are really expressing their own culture, thats patriarchal and tribal, and is a reflection of what the society was like before Islam came to the world. (Inside Islam)

This Documentary was very informative and put an end to the ignorant stereotypes created by many non-Muslims, including myself. I learned many things that I didn't know made the religion so unique. One big realization that I experienced during the movie was the similarities between the other monotheistic religions, Christianity and Judaism, with Islam. Islam is just an extension of those two religions that has continued to speak the words of God in other forms. Another quality that makes Islam so distinct and that was unknown to me before the documentary, was their influence on the world regarding, medicine, science, and the number system. Concepts such as algebra, calculus, and trigonometry all come from Arabic backgrounds. Medicine however, is where Islam makes its grand distinction. While Christians in Europe used exorcism and bloodletting to treat the sick, clean hospitals in the Muslim world were practicing advanced surgical techniques, orthopedics and even treating mental illness. This movie was an inner realization for me, because it helped me realize how stereotypical I was being towards such an open and humane religion. After watching this, I now know to think twice when making quick judgments about things and people without knowing the story behind them.

Altogether, I give this documentary five out of five stars because it tells the story, the religion's meaning and what it represents in a captivating and clarifying way. It was very eye opening to things that I wasn't aware of before. I believe that if American viewers, most of whom are ignorant to Islam's culture, become educated on the resemblance and interrelationships between Christianity and Islam, then they too might change their perspectives on Islam. I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially people that are unaware of what Islam means and what a grand role it plays on our society today.",1449446400,,6180,5.089743589743589
