8558071,4,B00AVL7SJY,"Surprisingly, I liked this quite a bit. Sure, it's an in-name-only ""sequel"" to Herzog's masterful Nosferatu. It suffers from mid-1980s trappings: Kinski's hair metal band hair (plus extensions!), a cheesy and forgettable synth score, over-reliance on pre-existing sets (Venice), etc. But it's still kinda awesome. There are multiple impalements, bridging Nosferatu and Vlad the Impaler; rats, some really sexy full body nudity actresses Klaus has sex with, and a great scene in which Kinski (Nosferatu) expresses calmly (!) his contempt for Christianity. He skulks around menacingly, as he always does, and brings a kind of seasoned intensity to the role (he refused to shave his head or wear makeup for the role). In this story, he terrorizes Venice and becomes both vampyre and human -- his reflection starts to show up, he can tolerate daylight, etc. The filmmakers were obviously trying to capture something of the tone of Herzog's film, with mixed results. Donald Pleasence just eats for most of the film before getting really angry at the end. This is surely not really as good a follow-up as Herzog's film, but those are big shoes to fill. I think given that challenge, this film does surprisingly well.",1524355200,,1210,5.116161616161616

8558074,4,B00AVL7SJY,"Huge fan of the Werner Herzog 1979 Nosferatu, this kinda sorta sequel (in that it has Klaus Kinski as Dracula and its shot in Venice) has its merits. I'd seen this oddity in the '80s around the time it came out and had a craving to watch it again but it's hard to find. Strange fun and Klaus Kinski is always a good time. Also it has Donald pleasance, Christopher Plummer, Dracula and Venice. And lots of T&A! What's not to like?",1365033600,4,429,4.2439024390243905
