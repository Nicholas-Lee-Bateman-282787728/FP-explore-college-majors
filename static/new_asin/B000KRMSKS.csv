2697066,5,B000KRMSKS,"I had been thinking of buying a Universal DVD player for some time, just so I could buy and watch Golden Earring on DVD.  I bought ""Live From the Twilight Zone"" on tape when it first came out in the 80s - I loved it then, and still love it now.  Finally with the issue of ""Live in Ahoy 2006"" I took the big step (led in part by an early, erroneous listing of NTSC for this DVD on Amazon).  After receiving the DVD and seeing it was PAL I bought a Universal player - IT WAS ALL WORTH IT!  All the standards are here, plus great performances of ""Bombay"", ""Are You Receiving Me"", and Frank Carillo's ""What You Gonna Do (When The Levee Breaks)"".",1178064000,12,641,4.104

8158850,1,B000KRMSKS,I am A golden Earring fan. I purchased Golden Earring Live In Hanoi from Amazon. The DVD did not play (I tried 3 different players) They did refund my money but I still paid the return postage. Screwed again!!,1348876800,,209,4.384615384615385
8158851,5,B000KRMSKS,"Thank the powers that i had a region 1,2 dvd player and found out before buying one. THIS CONCERT ROCKS!!!From EVIL LOVE CHAIN to HOLY,HOLY LIFE there is not one lame song on this disc. After 40+  years together these guys are not only tight and they obviously love playing together. Barry is great on vocals and is also a compitant guitarist. George is great on guitar and good on lead & backing vocals.as far as Rinus goes I think he's one of the best bass players around. And then there is Cesar(yeah I spelled it wrong),one of my favorite drummers. This guy is enjoying the hell out of drumming. The only other drummer I know that looks like he enjoys drumming as much is Johny Barbata. Plus it comes with a cd of half the show. In short,if you like fantastic music,GET OFF YOUR ASS and get one of the best shows ever filmed. Of course I'm a little biased,I'm only missing 5 or 6 of their albums on album and cd. G.E.rule!",1289433600,,926,4.32183908045977
8158852,5,B000KRMSKS,"I love this band ""Golden Earring"", from the Netherlands, but I didn't have a Universal DVD player. This is not a region 1 DVD. So, I ordered a Universal DVD player thru Amazon, for only around $34. It is well worth the investment. This DVD is simply outstanding from beginning to end. It is good hard rock music, and very guitar oriented. This is a dvd and a cd combo. The approximate running time of the dvd is 123 minutes.

The line-up is:
George Kooymans - guitar,vocals
Barry Hay - guitar, flute, vocals
Rinus Gerritsen - bass, keyboards
Cesar Zuiderwijk - drums
Bertus Borgers - saxaphone
Frank Carillo - guitar

The song set is:
1. Evil Love Chain
2. Sky Scraper Hell of a Town
3. Another 45 miles
4. Watcha gonna do (When the Levee breaks)
5. Future
6. Twilight Zone (Super Outstanding with excellent guitar work)
7. Save Your Skin
8. Are you Receiving Me
9. Smoking Cigarettes
10. Just a Little Bit of Peace in my Heart
11. Kill Me (Ce Soir)
12. Gambler's Blues
13. Bombay
14. When the Lady Smiles
15. Going to the Run
16. Johnny Make Believe
17. Bass Solo
18. Radar Love (Outstanding)
19. Drum Solo
20. Long Blond Animal
21. She Flies on Strange Wings
22. Holy Holy Life

Overall, this is a great DVD/CD Combo, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!",1261872000,8,1257,4.432900432900433
8158853,5,B000KRMSKS,Being a fan of GE for years I never thought I would see a live show on DVD. This DVD was very good. I enjoyed seeing and hearing one of my favorite bands.
