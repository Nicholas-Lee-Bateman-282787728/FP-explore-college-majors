6432504,4,B00KITEHES,"Not his best work. But any new film by John Sayles is to be savored and explored. If you are a fan, you will enjoy this. If you have never seen any of his films, do not use this as your introduction to his work. Come at it after seeing something else first.",1413417600,2,257,3.8679245283018866

6432509,5,B00KITEHES,"Know this: I'm not a John Sayles ""fan"" as I find the majority of his films after (but not including) Lone Star to be unwatchable polemics.  His politically driven ""dialogue"" can be excruciating, even when he thinks he's being subtle.  Feel the same way about Ken Loach, too.

But Lone Star (and some of the early ones) are excellent.  As is Go For Sisters.  Here he highlights again his ability to bring out the best in actors (don't forget he knew early on that Matthew McConaughey could go deep). His sympathy for his characters is clear here but isn't overwhelmed by politics proper, it's just respect for humanity.

Most striking is Yolonda Ross.  Her performance is what people should mean when they talk about ""fearlessness"" in acting.  It's not about weight loss or gain, aping a developmental disability, playing ""against"" your sexuality, or any of that nonsense.  It's a removal of ego that's so complete that the audience has to catch themselves from thinking they're watching a documentary.  That's a credit to the writing as well, of course.  Ross and Hamilton definitely had me from the first scene (and I have found Hamilton kind of grating in the past, so good on her as well). Olmos is good, but don't watch this for Olmos.  You have to be open to watching these strong women carry the picture.

None of this is to say it is the best an independent film could possibly be, but y'know, when you're working with these budgets and deadlines and getting something so moving out of it, you deserve 5 stars.  If Sayles could pull this off every time he'd be more of an art-house fixture instead of a straight-to-art-video fixture.

P.S. Ignore the cover art.  I don't know what they were thinking with that sloppy paste-up job as the film itself is meticulously shot. The original poster (a long shot of the 3 on a highway) was much better.",1410220800,10,1850,4.66358024691358
6432510,4,B00KITEHES,"This is a hypnotic character piece starring Lisa Gay Hamilton & Yolonda Ross. I say hypnotic because what transpires in the film is captivating yet a backdrop to the actual plot. James Edward Elmos is a supporting actor whose character like the movie, seems out of pace on the surface, but powerful in its subtle and intentional direction.  The plot of the movie is truly just the means to and end.  The end is Lisa Gay Hamilton and Yolonda Ross demonstrating this interplay of tension, expectations, remembrance, and transcendence.  The film is equally about Lisa Gay Hamilton's character dealing with and experiencing the pain of a mother fearing and fighting for her child's life, as well as two women connecting beyond friendship and their past experiences.  I enjoyed the surreal effect of the film's pace and character interplay.",1408579200,11,835,5.028985507246377
6432511,4,B00KITEHES,I don't see Edward James Olmos very often now.  Glad he decided to do another picture.  Good script and acting from all parties involved.  I'd see it again.,1408060800,9,156,4.5
8659306,5,B00KITEHES,"Edward James Olmos can do NO wrong as far as I'm concerned.  From ""Zoot Suit"" to ""Wolfen""  to ""Miami Vice"" to ""Go For Sisters"" he rocks big time.  An incredible actor w/strong Hispanic views...I've admired him for most of his career.  He lends a ""presence"" to all his films.

8659311,5,B00KITEHES,"[No spoilers, other than conceptual]

Trust John Sayles to deliver believable characters in a meaningful story. And when I can't understand why or how something happened the way it did, it's my failure; I have learned to trust Sayles' impeccable cause and effect and his belief that the audience does not need to be led by the nose. It's worth watching twice in a short time to recognize how every scene matters in building the characters and the story.

I heard a critic on NPR say this film needed more action, especially that the resolution was anticlimactic. I say, that critic needed more depth of character, or at least should have viewed the film another time for a chance to understand it. A gun fight is a simple and trite device. (I grew up on westerns and crime shows. I'm not opposed in principle.) In a story about good vanquishing evil, they work. Go for Sisters is a journey during which the characters form lasting connections. The stakes are life and death, but the payoff is deeper than just the preservation of life. Evil exists, but it's not embodied by a simple villain. There is no magic bullet or golden gun that will make us feel like the world is a safer place, but the protagonists' actions make their world a better place, probably for the rest of their lives.

Sayles movies are about people and about the settings, because they're integral. You get few or zero views from above, by way of helicopter or boom, not only because of budget but because Sayles explores characters and settings from the ground level. Go For Sisters incorporates a complicated setting with multicultural, social, and criminal elements worthy of comment. But you are exposed to those elements along with the characters. Nothing is obligatory, gratuitous, or condescending. Sayles keeps exposition minimal, allowing the story to unfold around the characters, and everything is made meaningful. This film is about the people and the story, and how a dramatic event has dramatic impact on their lives.",1459296000,,2002,4.847953216374269
8659312,5,B00KITEHES,"THIS MOVIE HAD ME SCRATCHING THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR. THIS TRIO OF ACTORS HAD A CHEMISTRY THAT WAS REALISTIC. EDWARD JAMES OLMOS PUT JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ""MEANESS"" IN HIS ROLE. YET SOMEHOW I KNEW HE WOULD BALANCE EVERYTHING OUT.",1456617600,,230,4.5
