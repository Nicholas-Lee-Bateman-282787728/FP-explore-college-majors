7943040,3,B00005KARL,Choose Your Own Nightmare: Night Of The Werewolf is not a kindly well designed movie however it worth to watch. The special effects looked poor to me not very well besides the sound and the music is not so strong. It is your choice to buy or not to buy it. I can not tell anything clearly about this movie.,1007510400,2,306,4.116666666666666
