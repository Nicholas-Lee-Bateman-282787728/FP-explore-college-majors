8316692,5,B001KZVQF2,"Before I share my thoughts down here about this DVD, it is worth laying out on the table that this is not a stormchasing DVD or one on the science/technical details of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes. You will not see much current chasing footage or simulations to show what goes on in the events of tornadogenesis. There is however a lot of vintage tornado footage to be found here which goes to show that tornadoes were just as violent and deadly back then as they are today.
This DVD is an old documentary about some of the most notorious and devastating tornado outbreaks in history and the ensuing cost of damage and loss of life. There are sections on historic tornadoes such as the 1840 Great Natchez tornado, the 1925 Tri State Tornado, the Super Outbreak of 1974 in the Midwest (including the F5 that occurred in Xenia Ohio) and the Plainfield Disaster of 1990 and the extent of the damage path by the storms.
There are also lots of interviews with survivors of some of these outbreaks who vividly tell of what they did to survive and their losses as well as meteorologists and other weather experts to provide further understanding and is chock full of some of the earliest and most compelling tornado footage and photos ever documented.
All in all the thing to take away from this is an excellent insight into how these events unfolded and would ultimately become instrumental in shaping the course and evolution of tornado warnings and how those would go onto become ever more sophisticated in time and preventative of the losses of life. It is also a must have DVD for anyone interested in tornadoes.",1400889600,2,1619,4.704225352112676

8316696,3,B001KZVQF2,I expected more tornadoes pictures and videos. It is an historic review of some tornadoes events. I'm fascinate by tornadoes and I am disappointed by the DVD because it shows always the same tornadoes pictures... But the history part is still interesting...,1369353600,,257,5.142857142857143

8316698,5,B001KZVQF2,This is an awesome DVD on Tornadoes probably the best one since TVC (Tornado Video Classics). What struck me about this release is how detailed it was about history's worst tornadoes and the impact on it's survivors. The Tri-State tornado is the most detailed in this program but also explores the Super Outbreak of 1974 and tornado Forcasting. If you like tornadoes like I do go get this now.,1359849600,6,393,4.7101449275362315

8316701,5,B001KZVQF2,"This show was exceptionally well done. Tasteful, informative and it sparked my interest on learning more about events such as the Tri State Tornado, which was just devastating and bizarre.  The refreshing thing about this show is it took a break from the ""tornado chaser"" mentality and instead gave a graphic description with eye witness accounts, pictures and footage of some of the most catastrophic tornados to hit the U.S. since record keeping started.",1240617600,19,456,5.162162162162162
