8595313,5,B0006Q93RE,"T.S.O.L. are on top form here!
Filmed as if it were a home movie, they shred their way through all of the classics inc. ""Dance with me"", ""The Triangle"" and ""Code Blue"" on the island of Hawaii in 2003.
Jack Grisham is on top form with his quips and various stories between songs. Even bassist Mike Roche is the victim of Jack's playfull wrath for his inability to play ""Weathered Statues"" correctly anytime!
Ron Emory for me is one of the best ""riffers"" of a punk rock guitar ever, and shows it here by playing each song with deadly precision.
Let's not forget original drummer Todd Barnes (R.I.P.) for setting down some of the more complex punk rock drum rhythms ever, thus making T.S.O.L. one of America's best punk bands ever!",1378080000,,728,4.564885496183206
8595314,5,B0006Q93RE,"This T.S.O.L. video is the best live video of the band on the market. You won't be disappointed! Hawaiian Express did a great job on this release. There is a ton of great bonus footage and it has 16 of their greatest hits, like Code Blue, Triangle, WWIII, Abolish Govt, Man and Machine... get one now!",1104796800,6,301,4.392857142857143
