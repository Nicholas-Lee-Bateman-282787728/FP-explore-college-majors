534904,5,6302921384,"Ranger Hal (Michael Rooker) drags his soon-to-be-departed girlfriend on a dangerous climb high in the Rockies.  He injures his knee which forces another ranger (Sylvester Stallone as Gabe) to come to their rescue.  Faulty equipment and panic causes the girlfriend to fall to her death.  Refusing to take responsibility for his poor judgment, Hal instead guilts Gabe into quitting the rangers.  After a solid pout lasting eight months, Gabe returns just in time for recriminations, more guilt, and a high stakes treasure hunt in the snow.  A hackneyed bad guy straight from central casting, (John Lithgow as Qualen) wants the money he outsourced to other bad guys to steal for him.  Theres dissension in the ranks, sabotage from above, and trigger-happy lunatics who don't understand what stealth meansor what causes avalanches.

Excitement, melodrama, lovely scenery, and some pretty decent action sequences.  On the downside, this movie was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards:  Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actor (John Lithgow), Worst Supporting Actress (Janine Turner), and Worst Screenplay.  It was also nominated for three Oscars: Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, and Best Visual Effects.  Winning nothing but a huge chunk of money at the box-office.

John Lithgows pathetic attempt at a British accent aside, this is still one of my favorite action flicks.",1504656000,,1379,5.392523364485982

534909,3,6302921384,"Very over the top and pretty cheesy at times. But it is action packed and fun if that's what you're looking for and if the premise interests you. Many of the practical stunts were very impressing and the scenery sure looked nice.

Big problem with the movie is the over the top and loud villains and the lack of depth or connection with the characters in general. The plot is straight up over the top and goofy at times so it's something you have to accept when watching this. I really wish there was just more connection with the characters. It also seemed to me that maybe about half the actors were really trying to put forth a serious performance. The acting ranges from okay to pretty bad. I've got a soft spot for Sly and as far as over the top action movies go this is decent, but don't expect much more than that.",1499299200,,821,4.296774193548387

534942,4,6302921384,"Released in 1993 and directed by Renny Harlin from a script by Michael France & Sylvester Stallone, Cliffhanger is an action/adventure about a Rocky Mountain rescue team who are called in to assist a band of supposedly trapped hikers, who are actually thugs seeking millions of dollars in three suitcases after a botched skyjacking. Stallone, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner and Ralph Waite appear as the rescue squad while John Lithgow, Caroline Goodall, Rex Linn and Leon appear as the wannabe skyjackers.

If you're in the mood for serious mountain action you cant go wrong with Cliffhanger. Its marred by a comic book plot and over-the-top action sequences, but somehow the story & characters make you roll with it and relish it rather than mock it. The mountainous locations are spectacular and Stallone never looked better at 46. Also, anyone who doesnt think Lithgow could make an effective villain should see this film.

Cliffhanger is pure entertainment and should not be confused with authentic mountain climbing. However, its almost realistic in comparison to the ridiculously overdone action sequences of 2000s Vertical Limit.

The film runs 112 minutes and was shot in the Italian Alps with some shots of the Colorado Rockies and studio work done in Rome.

534981,3,6302921384,"Gabriel Walker is a man of many talents. He can climb mountains, he can repel from mountainsides, he can jump--make that leap over cliffs, he can fall down thin crevasses without being hurt, he can fight bad guys, he can even impale them on stalagmites after taking enough punishment that would cripple even a strong man, he can beat men up on the side of crashed helicopters and throw them back inside before the machine crashes to the Earth and he is all but indestructible in doing so. Come on, man!

When I first saw this movie I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I saw it in theatres. But then I was a kid. Now as an adult when seeing this movie I have to laugh at the absurdity of it all. There is no amount of money that would make me want to risk life and limb for all of that money. First and foremost would be getting away and writing the endeavor off. Qualen clearly was a man of means and money. So he could easily have written off the expedition and still not had to worry about paying off his henchmen. In my opinion after the first batch of money was lost any sane man would have called it quits and lured the chopper in and escaped.

Hal Tucker, Gabe's buddy, warns his friends of impending disaster not once, not twice but thrice and he is not slain by the baddies! Give me a break! The movie loses so much credibility after he was not killed the second time he warns the kids of impending doom. Unrealistic, as was how he dupes Delmar (Played Wonderfully By Craig Fairbrass) into letting him live long enough to disarm and then slay him. A hitman would have immediately put a bullet in between his eyes.

I give this movie a Three Star rating only because of the incredible scenery and aerial photography and mountain range cinematography. It's the best I've ever seen. Lithgow's portrayal as a ""heavy"" was fantastic too. He's come a long way since his days as a slasher in Blowout. Those things as well as the big explosions and a nice solid role for one of my former family favorites (Ralph Waite From The Waltons) make this movie Thee Stars. I'm the 23rd person to give this three stars and the 278th overall to review this film.

534982,1,6302921384,"First a Description of My Screenshots:

One is this great moment when Stalone swims up from the bottom of a frozen lake to seek his revenge, and the other is when the chopper pilot laughs his buttoff when a poor innocent climber dies. They are strange, strange moments in the movie.

Now the Review:

I'm a huge fan of climbing movies, but having seen all just about all of them I decided to dip back into the past and watch Cliffhanger. I think I missed it in the '90s, and now I know why. Let's just get the plot described briefly: Stalone and his Colorado mountain ranger buddies end up ensnared in a heist-gone-wrong that literally falls out of the sky. Stalone saves the day over and over (often with helpless women screaming) while climbing very skillfully up several ladders, bridges, cliff faces, and even the underside of a helicopter. Some of the finer lines in the film are given to his rival, John Lithgow, who says things like ""I told you so"" and ""The war is not out there, it's in here.""

You'll be shocked at the inconsistencies in this film. At one moment a character is at a river's edge, and the next on a mountaintop. Stalone himself if often filmed in tree-lined valleys that are then on mountain tops. At one point, a frozen lake is a 12 second stroll from a clifftop. There is even a moist cave (think Vietnam) nestled up there in the rockies. So that's all super laughable.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention: nearly everyone dies in this movie, mainly from gunshots but some from explosions and a few from catastrophic falls. If you want a climbing movie, you don't really get one here. It's more of a thugs-hit-the-Alps kind of a  flick.",1477699200,,1663,4.490066225165563

Probably the best movie Sly made in the 90s. See it just for the ending alone. You won't be disappointed.",1447545600,,502,4.08080808080808

535261,4,6302921384,"Last time i saw this was on 'VHS' i' knew i liked the film, but had forgotten how enjoyable it was.
'Sylvester Stallone' plays a mountain rescuer 'Gabe Walker' who after a tragic accident he blames himself for, leaves his partner and friends behind and disappears .
One year later he returns, can he re-kindle his previous life or is it too late ?
A call comes through for the rescue team, 5 people trapped on the mountain after a plane is forced to make an emergency landing, because of the weather the 'chopper' can't take to the air, 'Gabe' ( sly ) is asked to help because of his climbing skills.
The five stranded have a hidden agenda, and have a need for the mountain climbing skills of the team now on the way.
It turns into a fight to survive the brutal intent of those the team thought they had come to save.
Great action, great stunt work, great scenery, the latter of which is the main aspect of the film to benifit from it's 'Blu-ray' upgrade
the film is well worth owning or in fact re-visiting.",1446163200,,1008,4.338624338624339

535369,4,6302921384,"The  beginning  is  a  little  hard  to  watch.  At  the  very  beginning  before  Sarah's  death,  before  they  got  to  where  they  were  all  at  Jessie  says  Gabe  where  are  you  at?  He  says  oh  I'm  just  hanging  out.  That's  nothing  I'd  ever  do  believe  me!  Not  without  ropes.  So  Sylvester  Stallone  I  guess  you  are  braver  than  me!  Viewers  welcome  to  some  of  the  highest  mountain  country  in  north  America!
Sarah  was  not  an  experienced  hiker,  I  just  think  Hal  wanted  her  to  see  the  view!  Hal  insists  that  sliding  on  the  rope  or  cable  from  the  edge  of  the  cliff  to  the  helicopter  isn't  any  big  deal,  &  Gabe  says  to  Sarah  ready  for  the  best  ride  in  the  park?  She  starts  off  okay,  but  all  her  straps  were  coming  undone  &  she  starts  to  slip  with  only  the  belt  buckle  hooked  onto  that  turnbuckle.  Sarah  goes  into  a  terrifying  panic!  Gabe  makes  an  attempt  to  rescue  her, But  she  slips  out  of  his  grip  &  falls  to  her  death,  both  Gabe  &  Sarah  had  gloves  on  at  the  time  he  had  ahold  of  Sarah, If  he  didn't  have  any  gloves  on  his  hand,  its  possible  he  might  have  been  able  to  get  a  better  grip  &  save  Sarah.  After  she  fell  to  her  death  Hal  stares  at  Gabe  from  the  helicopter  with  a  blameful  look  on  his  face.
What the  movie  is  really  about  though  is  about  a  gang  of  terrorists  led  by  Eric Quallen  (John Lithgo)  from  Footloose.
Who  the  FBI  had  been  tracking  without  success.  Who  are  carrying  3  brief  cases  of  money,  &  they  lose  them  when  they're  accidentally  dropped  from  the  plane.  Hal (Michael Rooker) &  Gabe  (Sylvester Stallone) answer  a  distress  call,  where  before  Hal  releases  his  anger  onto  Gabe  for  the  death  of  his  girlfriend  Sarah.
Then  they  learn  the  distress  call  was  a  phony  &  are  forced  to  find  the  brief  cases  of  money,  Gabe  gets  free shortly  after  finding  one  of  the  brief  cases  &  throws  it  overboard  with  the  avalanche.
I  like  this  one  because  of  the  action,  Hal  &  Gabe  lose  a  lot  friends  in  the  movie,  2  kids  in  their  early  20's  then  Frank. I  think  the  movie  was  filmed  somewhere  in  Colorado.  Both  Hal  &  Gabe  must  survive  Blizzards,  &  outwit  Eric  &  the  terrorists. &  take  them  out  one  by  one.
I  didn't  like  the  part  where  Eric  Quallen  kills  one  of  his  own,  the  lady  called  Crystal.  To  send  a  threat  to  Travers.  That  was  harsh,  &  I  get  the  same  feeling  every  time.  What's  mostly  odd  is  Travers  was  pointing  the  gun  at  Eric  at  that  part  of  the  movie,  &  had  the  perfect  chance  to  kill  him.  Both  Hal  &  Gabe  get  the  s***  knocked  out  of  them,
By  a  black  guy  named  &  another  fellow  named  Delmar.  But  get  the  upper  hand!  Stallone  has  that  never  quit  attitude  no  matter  how  much  punishment  someone  gives  him. Brace  yourself  for  this  harsh  hitting  action  Movie!
Good  movie  from  start  to  finish.  That  was  one  wild  ride  in  the  Rockies,  Battered  &  Bruised  both  Hal  &  Gabe  survive!!",1431561600,,3250,4.236190476190476

I thought the movie itself was enjoyable. This is one of those movies where you will have to suspend some disbelief for a couple of hours, and what is so wrong with that? Not every film has to be boring, slow and take itself way to seriously. The cast was pretty good. Sly has proven he is a very effective action hero. Michael Rooker (the guy who plays Yondu in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) was pretty decent as Slys' best friend. John Lithgow, however, didn't make a very good villain. His European accent wasn't very convincing, in my opinion. I think his role would've been better played by Brian Cox, Anthony Hopkins, David Warner or Christopher Lee. The action by itself was pretty decent and intense enough that it had to be edited to get an R rating. I think in this day and age the uncut version would just get an R rating.",1421884800,,994,4.320855614973262

Stallone recues the male but not the female. As we watch, it appears to us that the woman dropped to her death because she did not act properly because she was too afraid. But Stallone blames himself and quits his job. The boyfriend also blames him.
Meanwhile, a master thief who is a psychopathic murderer and his gang steal $100 million during an air hijack, which is fascinating. But it goes wrong. There is a crash. The hijackers call for help and the dead girls boyfriend responds.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review - `Cliffhanger' is Sylvester Stallone and anybody alive in the 1980's remembers that bold billing of the star who basically singlehandedly started the great action craze of the decade. Sly Stallone is that star; with pictures like the Rocky sequels, the Rambo's and offbeat films like `Nighthawks' and `Lock Up', Sylvester Stallone confirmed that action hero image and was on the top of the game. With hit after hit, he became a larger than life figure, who could not only act when the situation called for it, but could also put out countless dumbed-downed action flicks that so many of us still crave. So here we are, in the early 1990's. Stallone has convincible wrapped up his career launching franchises, and is looking for something different. The question is; how is `Cliffhanger' different? It's probably not. `Copland' was more of a return to form, but one thing is clear about `Cliffhanger'; it has a hell of a lot more snow than anything we've seen from him before.

A gang of terrorists plan to hijack a plane carrying $100 million dollars in uncirculated US Department of Treasury notes. With no real easy way to pull off such an intricate plot against the government, a daring mid-air exchange between a freight carrier and a small plane is ultimately necessary to transfer the loot. The heist is to be executed in collaboration between a traitorous CIA agent Travers [Rex Linn] and the fearless gang, run by a crazed lunatic named Eric Qualen [John Lithgow]. Travers has turned sides and there is no going back, so it's basically carry out the plot flawlessly or die in shame. In doing so, he must kill everyone on board, even his fellow agents. One thing neither accounted for is a sloppy exchange that left one agent alive enough to shoot. So during the transfer, the cases were lost and spread out over hundreds of miles of the snow laden, mountainous terrain of the Rocky Mountains.

Enter our unknowing hero, Gabe Walker [Sylvester Stallone], who is a mountain guide by day, stud muffin by night. He is currently struggling with the death of his best friend's fiance, a death that he inadvertently caused. The question of what happens when an inexperienced climber, Sarah [Michelle Joyner], reaches the top of precarious peak is answered, as she dies a gruesome death. I mean come on, what else did you expect to happen? Her high-altitude plunge leaves her future husband Hal Tucker [Michael Rooker] and Gabe torn with regret. Their friendship suffers, as Hal is convinced that Gabe caused her to fall. It really doesn't make that much sense though, as Gabe tried to save her and Hal should have never put the novice climber in such a position.

After the terrorists crash land, because of damaged suffered in the brief firefight, they begin to search for the lost bounty. In the process they call the mountain rangers for a rescue team, in a brilliant play of assistance that turns out to be double sided ploy. Just so happens, that Gabe is back in town to reclaim a lost love of his own, Jessie Deighan [Janine Turner], and also to pack up the rest of his belongings into the back of his beat-up, Jeep Waggoner. Seriously, I mean what women in her right mind wouldn't want to run away from a snowy paradise to live out of the back of Gabe's crappy Jeep. It's a no brainer really. When

Jessie Deighan calls out Gabe, asking him to face his fears rather than to run away, he agrees on one more rescue, which could very well be his last. Eric Qualen and his crew of misfits; including obsessed soccer fan Delmar [Craig Fairbrass] who couldn't act himself out of a wet paper bag, as he is without doubt the worst actor to ever grace the cinema screen, explosives expert Kynette [Leon Robinson], Travers of course, and one psycho broad named Kristal [Caroline Goodall], who has a tendency for delivering pain through sharpened steel. They may not be the coolest bunch, but they are all hell bench on finding the cash and nothing; not even torturous cliffs, extreme weather, at least 25 inches of snow, Gabe, Hal and did I mention snow, yes lots of snow...can stand in their way. It's really all pretty strange, how inexperienced climbers almost always come close to finding the cash just before a professional, who has basically lived most of his life in the Rocky Mountains. In fact, Gabe is so accustomed to the area that he can go for hours with basically no equipment and wearing nothing but a burlap sweater, aged from the early part of the century.

Fresh off the success of the dramatic film `Lock Up' and the not so classy comedy, Stop! or the ghastly embarrassing Estelle Getty Will Blow Your Freaking Brains Out, Sylvester Stallone was looking to switch things up and steer clear from the typical Box Office behemoths of pictures he was associated with the majority of his career. So he went on to film the snowy action thriller in `Cliffhanger`. Don't worry about Sly though; he is never really in any danger or falling to his death or catching a cold from not wearing a jacket the entire film. Stallone is ripped for the film as always. It's amazing how good the man looks, as he is actually 47 years old during filming. Unbelievable really, how the man maintains a near perfect physic. Hell, I'm almost 30 and his body looks better than mine, not that mine is terrible, hey - I work out! Janine Turner ages faster than fine wine, but turns out to be vinegar. It's cruel and unnecessary, but I really can't believe how fast the actress went from being the young and sexy Jessie in `Cliffhanger' to aged broad we found in the nightmarish television series, `Northern Exposure'. John Lithgow delivers a quality performance as the crazed Eric Qualen, and the same can be said about the rest of the cast, who plays out their parts with decent efforts.

`Cliffhanger' is not a particularly bad film; but has it edge of your seat moments. Don't get me wrong, I personally love the film and have so for almost two decades now and I've always been a huge Stallone fan in general. Almost obsessive actually. The film does have great locations and cinematography, even though the majority of the stunt shooting was filmed on big budget sets. A little known fact is that `Cliffhanger' is actually in the Guinness Book of World Records. For the most expensive aerial stunt ever preformed. Simon Crane, a stunt man, was paid a million dollars to perform the intense aerial transfer scene in which he crossed between two planes at an altitude of 15,000ft. It garnished some respect and maybe more than I've given, as it was nominated for 3 Oscars; Best Visual, Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound. I still remember seeing the film in the theatre as a teenager and the nostalgia effect looms large in my screening of the film. This probably accounts for my generous score, as I rated the film 6, which seems harsh, but in reality, it probably reaches its peak at a 5. In any event, fans who loved the film then, will undoubtedly love it now as it really has aged pretty well. It's still packed with action and the storyline is well executed with little flaws or overall holes. It's a grand scale, fun film and that's all it really reaches for, and never claims to be anything else.

Blu-ray Video Quality - StudioCanal debuts `Cliffhanger' as an avalanche of thrills on Blu-ray with a stunning awesome 1080p encoded image and the results are anything but ordinary. Mostly shot through exterior locations and sets, the scenery is intense and realistic. Anyone who has seen the film countless times, as I have, will remember how dull and sometimes grey the exterior shots were in the original source. On Blu-ray we find the lifeless exteriors transformed into vibrant and naturalistic outlooks. The disc is clean and bright, with a freshness to it that is unmistakable. Some dulling effects are noticeable to background shots, especially long- range camera pans. Clarity is fine and the overall sharpness has been dramatically improved. A minor problem I noticed was that the actual snow wasn't really crisp enough and never really popped with detail or contrast. One never really gets the sense that you are in the mountain range, as altitude is minor at times and blunted. Colors appear bold and natural, sometimes glowing with intensity. Skin tones are a little bronzed at times, but never outright glazed. The transitions from the live action sequences to sets are noticeably and sometimes hinder the transfer in certain areas. The interior sets appear darker and the overcast changes in tone, with some loss of intensity. The `big-air' stunts appear a little grated and the overcast appears a bit darker and dulled, as do mountain cavern scenes.

Blu-ray Audio Quality - ""If you want me, I'm in here."" Those words have never sounded better than through the intricate 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track either in English or German. Overall, the Blu-ray sounds totally awesome and fantastic at the same time, with bold sensitivity to the background and concentrated bass throughout. Helicopters sound particularly intense, with wild flapping of the blades slightly inhibited for effect. Explosions slam through surrounds and ambiance is present with the correct amount of tone. Undoubtedly, one of the better sounding BD releases of 2010 so far. Honestly, despite the relatively low score that I felt was necessary for minor element flaws, I'm a fan of this transfer. It's clean, clear and sharp. A major upgrade from anything we've ever seen from the film. The overall effect is of the transfer is dramatic and powerful. I feel StudioCanal did right by the film and kept it natural. Never adding too much and taking away just the right amount of grain for impressive results. I can easily recommend this film and viewers can expect a beautiful experience on Blu-ray waiting for them.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Sneak Peaks: Flight and Cold Blood [German Voice Dub]

Documentary: ""Stallone on the Edge: The Making of 'Cliffhanger'"" [20:00] Sylvester Stallone, in costume for 'Demolition Man,' and Renny Harlin dominate this rambling, self-satisfied documentary that doesn't go into nearly enough depth about this daunting production. Sylvester Stallone talks about the importance of taking risks, expresses a fear of heights, and interjects some cheesy comments while on-set footage provides glimpses of life behind the scenes.

Interviews: Here you get up close and personal with short interviews with Sylvester Stallone, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Renny harlin, John Lithgow and Alle Abspielen [German Subtitles]

Theatrical Trailer [HD] [5:00] The classy original theatrical trailer is presented in high definition, that has only background music.

Trailers: Mann Beist Hund, Possession - Das Dunkle In Dir, Taratino XX, Total Recall, Universal Soldier - Regeneration and Vehicle 19 [German Voice Dub]

Finally, for diehard action fans, it really doesn't get much better than near vintage Sylvester Stallone, especially with all those bulging muscles. Now over 15 years since its release, `Cliffhanger' makes a darling comeback, with a dominating presentation that will sure knock your socks off, especially with the stunning visuals and detailed special effects. Sylvester Stallone remains true and pumps out another quality effort, as does the rest of the cast and the storyline read one of a modern classic. So much so, that a remake from `StudioCanal' was rumoured to begin filming in late 2010, but obviously they had second's thoughts or they could not raise the money? `Cliffhanger' on Blu-ray is sure to shock fans with its bold presentation and gorgeous transfer. It's really an easy buy and the only thing left to do is recommend it. Enjoy it, I sure did and to have this German Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray because it is a really beautiful stunning looking SteelBook and a great honour to add to my Blu-ray Collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Not unexpectedly it pretty much turned to vinegar in the intervening years.  Bad acting, bad script, bad story.  The only potential redeeming feature was some good cinematography which looks pretty in Blu-ray, but I'm not sure if the director understood the concept of continuity - one minute there is talk of an impending storm, the next scene is brilliant sunshine, then rain, and back (yes, I understand how variable weather can be in mountains, but this was just silly).

And  you've also got to hand it to Lithgow, who's equally convincing whether he plays a good guy, or a bad guy (he's a particularly cold-hearted bad guy in this one).

Looks like all of the Special Edition DVD features were ported over to this Blu Ray, and the picture quality itself is a marked improvement.

535969,5,6302921384,"Stallone, while considered a highly bankable action star (even into his 60s) is also a great writer (and in many respects very underrated...just look at Rocky or even Rocky Balboa) The action is suspenseful and at times intense. The dizzying heights only adds to the intensity. Add to that the impeccable performances by John Lithgow and of course Stallone, and you have one great movie. While not as in-your-face as say a Rambo movie or the Expendables, the action is well paced and believable. The story sets up everything rather nicely, and well John Lithgow, whether he is doing comedy or drama or in this case, playing someone you love to hate, is hard not to love. No one does over the top like John Lithgow. He just has a way of grabbing your attention and keeping it. With Stallone's star power it's hard to imagine anyone who  can steal a scene from him, but Lithgow is a worthy adversary and of course an exciting actor to watch. Some of the story seems a bit by-the-numbers compared to today's movies, but then again a lot of movies have been inspired by Stallone-written action pieces...so it's easy to over the look. But it's an easy Classic nonetheless",1366588800,,1166,4.660194174757281

536040,3,6302921384,"Well, this movie did not really live up to its title. To me a movie can't really be a cliffhanger because we are watching everything in one straight shot. Doctor Who on the other hand was brilliant at just simply leaving the story hanging drawing the audience back the next night, or week, to see how the situation was resolved. Cliffhanger was not like that. It did not keep me gripping my seat and the only thing I was waiting for was for the bad guy Qualin (John Lithgow) to die and the movie to end.

I could end here because to me there wasn't much in this movie that I have not seen before. The scenery didn't thrill me and the cinematography wasn't all that crash hot (unlike Bad Boys where it is brilliant). The reviewers seemed to have loved this movie but personally it may have been breathtaking in the cinema, but it was not at all breath taking for me. Stallone's character does not need a name because the character is simply Stallone. He is a very good actor but when directors cast him to be the typical brutal action hero then I am not really impressed. Tango and Cash was not Stallone and that is what I liked. Here he was a typical clich&eacute;d hero in a different role, where as he might be a cop in one movie, he is a mountain man here. No real point to it.

John Lithgow and his gang of thugs are pretty poor. They are just too brutal and evil to really catch my interest. They may have been cool and calculating in the air, but on the ground in the mountains they are just desperate, sadistic, and just running around with signs on their back saying ""kill me please!"" John Lithgow puts it aptly in his line, ""I guess you want to kill me, well take a number and get in line."" That is in line behind all of the audience who simply want to see him dead for being such a pathetic bad guy. Bad guys are supposed to have style and sophistication. They supposed to know what they are doing and have a goal in mind. They are also supposed to be intelligent, especially if they are able to pull off a mid-air heist such as the one the pulled in this movie. Lithgow is none of these, he even lacks the intelligence to know that you don't kill, or even intimidate your guides. You play it nice and easy. But if they were to do that then there would be little room for your stunts. Personally, I could probably rewrite this movie to make it much better.",1361145600,,2366,4.232300884955753

He returns about 8 months later to pick up his last remaining belongings when an emergency call comes in and his help is needed.  It leads him into a dangerous and action filled situation that involves the theft of 100 million dollars and the lives of those he holds dear to his heart.....

This is an intense action movie that takes place in the wintery Rocky Mountains and involves planes, helicopters and men armed that are ready to kill to get what they want.  Gabe must help them or face death or the loss of his friends.

I liked this movie and it contains a lot of excellent shots of the Rocky Mountains and of mountain climbers.  It also features and interesting storyline, suspense and a lot of good actors.  Stallone did a good job acting in this movie and of course many of the shots were set up to feature his muscular body.

536105,5,6302921384,"Forget about discussion of the plot and acting abilities.  You folk already know the story line, so let's discuss the most important part of buying a blu ray disc....the quality of the video and audio transfer.  Wish more people would review these aspects than telling me the story lines and their interpretations of such.

Many times older movies receive poor transfers to blu ray and often the excuse it is that ""They are older movies""  Cliffhanger on Blu ray proves that that excuse is bunk.
The transfer of the video on blu ray is exceptionally good.  The colors pop and are vivid with no grain, noise or any other video distraction.  It shows to me that some real effort went into transferring the original master to blu ray markedly improving it over the Standard DVD release which I also have.
The DTS HD audio is also a welcome addition and this is one disc where re editing for discreet channels, front and rears, is nicely used through out.  The sub is there when needed and if you have a hi end theater system, the Blu ray version makes it well worth your while.

The extras contain the regular documentary discussions and a couple of deleted scenes with excellent explanations by the director why they were not used.

If you are going to upgrade from a standard DVD or are just thinking about buying this on  Blu Ray, this disc will not disappoint.
All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

The story begins with two men and a woman on a snowy mountain. [Anyone underdressed for the cold weather?] A helicopter rescues them. ""Don't look down!"" There is a crisis, Sarah slips away! [Not a good beginning?] Eight months later Treasury Agents prepare to ship paper money by aircraft from Denver to San Francisco. Gabriel still feels guilty about that death. The airplane with the money shipment sees another jet following it. There is a surprise action on board! Can the lockers be transferred in flight? Yes. There is an explosive event to end this scene. Can those lockers be located? The jet lands on a snowy mountain top then calls for rescue. [Would those government agents discuss confidential matters in public?] The villains await the rescue team. They want to find those lockers and recover the money. [A well-planned operation?]

[Nobody wears a hat in cold windy weather.] The villains shoot at the rescuers and create an avalanche! Gabriel throws the locker over the cliff, it opens and spills its contents. Gabriel climbs to the station to get warm clothing. The find those $1000 bills and remove them from the locker. One villains uses nigh vision goggles but Gabriel overpowers him. Burning paper provides warmth. The story runs on with the usual dramatic threats and escapes. Can Gabriel and Jessie escape the overhead bomb? Yes. The rescue helicopter is decoyed into landing. Another killing. Gabriel and Jessie escape a booby-trap. One of the villains is sacrificed for power. Another one dies trying to kill Hal. The renegade agent follows a false lead. Travis complains about his choices. Gabriel escapes by jumping off a cliff. Travis walks on ice and meets his doom. Qualen has Jessie in the rescue helicopter and offers a trade. Qualen tries to get the bag of cash and gets a surprise. ""Run!"" Hal shoots at the helicopter, it falls. Qualen and Gabriel fight, only one survives. ""I'm out of here."" The good guys survive, of course.

The credits show a great number of names of those who worked behind the scenes. This is at best an average action adventure movie (or morality play) where the good guys triumph over the villains. It is an example where a better story would create a better movie. This background is unusual. [It reminds me of a 1940s film set in the mountains where bad guys try to recover hidden loot; I can't remember the name.]

When Nixon devalued the dollar in August 1971 he ordered a wage and price freeze and banned the production of currency that had a face value of over $100. McKinley was on the $500 bill, Cleveland was on the $1000 bill, and Madison was on the $5000 bill. The $10,000 bill was not in general circulation. In 1965 Johnson ended the use of silver in dimes, quarters, half-dollars, and dollar coins. The debasing of the currency usually occurs in wartime.",1333584000,,2850,4.810204081632653

It is a clear cut story with characters you want to succeed and villians you want to fail! Lithgow is so predictable but is effective in his roll as the mirthless bad guy.

The DTS soundtrack is crystal clear and rocks the room. The transfer shows very little grain and the colors seem natural and well balanced. There isn't a lot of evidence of DNR scrubbing though I'm sure there was some. A side note: I wish studios would start applying DNR a little more judiciously. They recorded movies on 35/65/70mm film and a little 'noise' adds both texture and depth to each frame (IMHO), but I digress. The bottom line for me: I really couldn't be enticed to trade-in my Superbit collection for new blu-ray transfers unless they offered something totally unresistable (like the new Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, etc.).",1322870400,,860,4.979166666666667

536190,3,6302921384,"I saw this in the theatres way back in 1993. I for one was suitably impressed by the trailer that promises epic action on the scale (no pun intended!) of 'Die Hard in the snowy mountains' with Stallone. With high expectations, I got what I want: R-rated action. Bloody of violent bloody and gratuitous cussing scenes. They don't really make this sort of high budget movies nowadays.

Renny Harlin is actually quite an adept in being an action movie director. His slo-mo scenes do reeked of John Woo's ballistic ballets, but no as gracefully done. In terms of all balls-out action, he's your man. Stallone practically sleeps walk through this role and adds nothing significant to action cinema, other than surviving 30 feet drops off cliffs.

All that is said and done, the picture quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent. So clear in fact, one could have fun nitpicking the horrible blue screen / green screen whatever it is that they were using in those days. One could tell that the planes were fake. The mid-air explosion is obviously superimposed. Stunt guys were easily identified and the helicopter at the end is obviously a model. The DTS-HD audio surpasses all previous home video editions, one could listen to the horrid Trevor Jones' 'melancholic' theme to this movie with extreme clarity. I still feel that age was not kind to this movie. Thanks to Blu-Ray, all special effects and audio deficiencies are out for the jury to judge.",1276473600,,1439,4.821862348178137

John Lithgow is a hoot as the head bad guy; he can play comedy and evil geniuses with equal panache and he is up to form here. Stallone is his rugged action-hero self and his performance is typical Stallone. If you love Sly, you'll enjoy this movie.
If you love beautiful scenery along with some fun action, you may also enjoy this movie and if you have a blu-ray surround sound home theater system, it should increase your enjoyment of the movie even more.
In short, this is not great movie but it's not awful either, so if this type of story is your cup of tea or if you are a Stallone fan, I think you'll enjoy it.
While this isn't exactly a 'movie-of-the-year' level film, it's a good trip for those who enjoy action adventure stories and I recommend it for a fun of it.",1269993600,,1049,4.357142857142857

They radio for help, and former ranger Gabe Walker and his partner Hal Tucker answer the call. Qualen and his men have a high-tech tracking device that shows them the locations of the three cases of missing money, but they need help traveling through the mountains, so they force Gabe and Hal to be their guides. Forced to scale a rock face in the middle of a snow storm, Gabe grabs some of the money and escapes. Gabe knows Qualen will kill Hal as soon as Qualen has the remaining cash, so, with fellow ranger Jessie Deighan, Gabe tries to reach the money before Qualen does. ""Cliffhanger"" is one of the most exciting action movies. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining, and one bad guy.

536242,4,6302921384,"In ""Cliffhanger,"" Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue who finds himself going after a gang of crooks, headed by Qualen (John Lithgow), who have hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane and crash- landed in the Rockies with millions of dollars. The underlying theme is about Gabe losing his nerve because of a tragic accident that occurred during a rescue attempt.  The mountainous location provides many opportunities for vertigo-inducing action scenes, with the nine-minute opening sequence easily the best.  There's an avalanche; a plane crash; rough, frigid weather; a thrilling rescue attempt; and an in-air, plane-to-plane transfer of the stolen money.
 Stallone fits his role nicely, but Lithgow steals the film.  Director Renny Harlin manages to keep the pace brisk and incorporate one thrilling sequence after another.  DVD/Blu-ray bonus features include commentary with Stallone and director Harlin, technical crew commentary, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, storyboards, and theatrical trailer.",1264636800,,1038,5.802631578947368
536243,4,6302921384,"In 1993, Renny Harlin (director of ""Die Hard 2') returned with a new action film starring Sylvester Stallone (""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" films), John Lithgow (""Dexter"", ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), Michael Rooker (""The Marine 2', ""Jumper"") and Janine Turner (""Friday Night Lights"", ""Strong Women"", ""Northern Exposure"").

The film would feature cinematography by Alex Thomason (""The Scarlet Letter"", ""Demolition Man"", ""Hamlet"") and music by composer Trevor Jones (""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", ""Around the World in 80 Days"", ""Dinotopia"").

The film which cost around $65 million to make did well in the box office as it made over $255 million worldwide and received fairly positive reviews despite many rock climbers felt the depiction of rock climbing was too Hollywood, unrealistic and had quite a bit of inaccuracies.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Cliffhanger"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 Widescreen) and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment did a great job in bringing this film to HD.  The Italian alps look absolutely beautiful and there is great detail for the rocks, surrounding scenery. The film is not too vibrant as there is overcast and there are not many vibrant colors seen in the film.  But there is extreme detail captured on the rocks and the ice/snow.

The scenery is just breathtaking and despite the cold and challenging conditions, director Renny Harlin and cinematographer Alex Thomson did a wonderful job in filming the location and various aerial views of people on the mountains.

There is a fine layer of grain on the film, skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and for a 1993 film, no sign of muggy DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) that I can see in this film, nor did I see any major compression artifacts.

But what fans of the film will enjoy is the lossless audio track for ""Cliffhanger"".  If you thought ""Air Force One"" sounded good on Blu-ray, Sony repeats the aggressive audio track for this film as helicopters, explosions and various sound effects are heard all around you.  The surround channel is utilized heavily during the action sequences of the film as well as a good amount of LFE coming from the subwoofer.  The film just sounds incredible!  Dialogue is clear through the center channel and music and effects sounds great coming from the front channels.

Overall, impressive PQ and AQ with subtitles in English, English SDH and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Cliffhanger"" was definitely one of the enjoyable films that Sylvester Stallone did in the 1990's (along with ""Judge Dredd"").  After the disastrous ""Rocky V"" in 1990, Stallone started to do more international films throughout the 1990's and in this case, both he and director Renny Harlin wanted to do something different in their careers and that was to have an action film that was more serious in nature.

Personally, I enjoyed ""Cliffhanger"" when it came out in theaters but there were certain situations that bugged me at the time and that was mainly Sylvester Stallone in the very cold weather without a jacket, high up in altitude and climbing the mountain with a t-shirt (it's further explained by Sylvester Stallone in the commentary) but it was one of the scenes that I had a hard time believing especially in freezing temperatures.

But it was definitely an enjoyable Stallone film.  Michael Rooker did a wonderful job in this film and the same with Janine Turner (and I'm glad that director Renny Harlin did not emphasize or use a major romantic sequence between Gabe and Jessie).

But I'm sure the question for fans of the film is if ""Cliffhanger"" is worth purchasing again?  Especially if you owned the two previous DVD's that were released in 2000 and the Superbit version in 2004.

If you enjoyed this film, my answer is yes.  The reason being is that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has improved with the picture quality and audio quality of their films.  Especially this 1993 film because in previous years, there was some DNR that made the film look to cloudy/waxy in appearance due to the DNR but with this film, you really can't tell it's 1993 when it comes to picture quality.  Video looks absolutely great compared to the original DVD.

You see the details of the rocks quite well but the location of where the film is shot, looks great!  The Italian Alps absolutely looks beautiful in this film and definitely an improvement from the DVD.

But the biggest improvement is the lossless audio.  For those who have a modern receiver that can take advantage of the lossless 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack and have a good speaker setup are going to love how this film sounds.  Since ""Sony Pictures Home Entertainmen"" released ""Air Force Once"" on Blu-ray, they have really found a way to take advantage of these older action films and ""Cliffhanger"" sounds remarkable on Blu-ray.  The soundtrack is quite immersive and you hear the audio all around you.

The Blu-ray features the same special features from the original DVD with the exception of the photo gallery but all-in-all, for those who own the previous DVD's will just love how this film looks and sounds on Blu-ray.

As for those who have never seen the film, ""Cliffhanger"" is not the best Sylvester Stallone action film but its one, if not the best action film he released in the 1990's.  Looking for an action film, definitely give ""Cliffhanger"" a try!",1264464000,,7455,5.027709861450693

536312,4,6302921384,"It's been a dozen or more years since I last saw CLIFFHANGER, but on a whim the other night, I took a new look at it.  Boy, times have sure changed!

This exciting action-adventure was made before backgrounds could be computer generated.  I remember that when it came out, it seemed fresh, gritty and realistic.  Now it is painfully easy to see how many of the scenes are played against fake backgrounds made of Styrofoam, or worse yet, against blue screens.  When characters are flying in helicopters, we see that the landscapes outside the open doors are really just movies of mountains going by.  And yes, that is more distracting than I care to admit...I've become spoiled by the far more seamless effects that are possible today.  Chances are, you will be too.

But this does not make CLIFFHANGER a bad movie.  It's such a clear, simple story that it still works tremendously well.  In a nutshell...some bad-guys (led by John Lithgow...more on him later) cause a plan full of money to crash into a mountain range.  They go to recover the money and essentially force one ""search and rescue"" kind of guy (Michael Rooker) to track their money for them.  They are followed by Rooker's colleague (played by Sylvester Stallone), who knows that once these guys have their money, they will kill Rooker.  Stallone works to thwart their plans by killing the bad guys off one by one.

It's a simple enough story, but what elevates it is the enormously successful opening sequence of the film.  We see Rooker and his girlfriend have climbed a mountain and are now kind of stuck on their high precipice.  While Rooker is an experienced climber, his girlfriend is not out of her league.  So these two need a little rescuing of their own.  A helicopter with Stallone, HIS girlfriend (Janine Turner) and their boss (Ralph Waite) lands on a mountain-top across from them, and a robe is passed between the two spots.  Rooker easily slides across the space, not fearful of the mile-long plunge below him.  But his girlfriend is understandably fearful, and Stallone persuades her to try the crossing.  She gets halfway across and then has trouble with her gear.  She is moments from death...so Stallone comes after her, and in a heartpounding, heartbreaking few moments, he is unable to save her...and she falls to her death.

In five minutes, we have established the main ""good"" guys, gotten us all well and truly to the edge of our seats, and created a dynamic between the two men that will haunt much of the rest of the film.  Stallone blames himself (and Rooker blames Stallone) for the death...even when we know that this woman had no business being up where she was, except that Rooker wanted to show off.

The film features many outstanding rock and mountain climbing sequences...and lots of snow.  No one ever seems to suffer from the cold...but other than that, it's a blunt, brutal, fast-paced film.  Each encounter between the good guys and bad guys is a little, exciting set-piece of its own.  The bad guys are a very typical cast-of-characters...frankly, they are taken almost directly from DIE HARD...a film which obviously greatly inspired CLIFFHANGER.  Stallone is like Bruce Willis' John McClane...capable of absorbing so much damage and still bouncing back.  However, Stallone is actually amazingly convincing in the role, both physically and as an actor.  He looks like a guy who could actually pull of the things he does...yet he plays it as a man unaccustomed to brutality.  He does what he does to save himself and his estranged friend.  As the movie progresses, he clearly comes to relish his role as ""avenger""...particularly after Lithgow and his crew pull a particularly sneaky stunt on Ralph Waite.

The DIE HARD comparisons continue with Lithgow's performance.  He is clearly modeled on Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber from that film...and unfortunately, he comes across as nearly laughable.  His performance is so over-the-top and his accent so hard to pinpoint that Lithgow falls short of being a criminal mastermind, but mostly comes off as a petulant little boy.  A psychopathic little boy, to be sure, but he doesn't quite generate the chills he is clearly meant to.  I often like Lithgow...but sometimes his oddness and acting-style do NOT serve the movie.  Such is the case here.

Rooker is perfectly fine in his role, and he gets a couple of good fight scenes in himself.  As with Stallone, he's also believable as a mountain climber.  He's also a noble guy, and we really empathize with him throughout.  Janine Turner, popular at the time for ""Northern Exposure"", looks convincing too with her short hair...but is really given little to do.  Carolyn Goodall, as Lithgow's girlfriend, plays the villainous role more convincingly than Lithgow.  Ralph Waite is always a pleasure to see...he radiates warmth and kindness.

But director Renny Harlin stages the action sequences so well, and Stallone gives one of his three or four best performances...and that's what makes the film hold up today.  The effects are ""old school,"" but the solid filmmaking overcomes this.  (A few years ago, VERTICAL LIMIT, a similar movie with far superior effects came out.  It sure looked great...but it totally missed the boat on creating genuine excitement.)  I think today's audience might have a hard time accepting the cheese-factor of CLIFFHANGER...although if anyone can get through the opening scene without breaking a sweat, I'd be surprised.  So, despite its flaws, I'm very glad I went back and took another look at this minor action classic.",1221696000,,5547,4.929881337648328

An hour later when they were still throwing it around like tomatoes at the La Tomatina festival, I wanted to turn it off and didn't for the sake of seeing how it ended.  The action is GREAT!  My only complaint is with the F-bombs.  Oh, and the pitiful acting done by the ""Third Rock from the Sun"" guy.  I liked him too. Man.  That was really poor casting.",1203724800,,624,4.19327731092437

I still chuckle at some comments - doesn't the viewers pay attention to the movie?
Gabe [Stallone] lost his best friends [Rooker] girl in the opening - he already has a thing for the female rescue pilot [Janine Turner] [if that is what she is]

Give or take - it has a lot of action - Lithgow [Erik Qualen] is an excellent maniac - it is the money or nothing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the money chase - and the slight humor involved, bunny rabbit and avalanche - the FBI? being left in the dust - they didn't seem to have any idea that their money could be stolen.  Silly guys.

I liked Gabe's apparent turn-down of Turner and then he shows up on the mountain ahead of Rooker - he may have lost his nerve but he is there for his friend [who doesn't want him there].

Great helicopter hang-up - just what Qualen deserved.  Was that the FBI to the rescue??? What slow pokes.

I started following this actor with all the Rocky movies, then Rambo, etc. This movie has the unforgettable death scene that hooks you in the beginning, and the stunts with the 'plane' that follow are excellent. When you mix mountain climbing with lots of snow and ice, and toss in some bad guys, there's bound to be a lot of action. The movie hasn't edged out the Rocky and Rambo movies as my favorites, but it's a good Stallone flick.

536331,4,6302921384,"Cliffhanger is an action thriller directed by Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2: Die Harder) and starring Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), John Lithgow (Blow Out), Michael Rooker (JFK), and Janine Turner.

The opening sequence of the movie is true to the movie's title. Stallone's character, Gabe Walker, hanging on a cliff of a mountain, and later, holding on tight to the hand of an unexperienced climber named Sarah as she's screaming and begging Gabe to save her life from the fall of death.

Gabe leaves his rescue work behind after the fateful death of his buddy Hal Tucker's, played by Rooker, girlfriend because he couldn't save her. Gabe happens to be back in the mountainous region to make amends with his girl, played by Turner, when Eric Qualen, played brilliantly by Lithgow, and his gang of theives hijack a government plane filled with millions of dollars, and crash land in the snow covered mountains of Colorado losing the cases of money in the process. Gabe and Hal are the first to arrive at the scene of the crash for rescue work only to be kidnapped by the gang and used to find the money. Of course, Stallone gets away and plays a cat and mouse game with the gang up and down the mountains.

Cliffhanger is spectacularly breathtaking, and one of Stallone's best action films. However, John Lithgow is the one who steals the show entirely with his menacing turn as the bad guy.

536332,3,6302921384,"The Good: great action flick, magnificiant scenery, loved Stallone doing the rock climbing. It looked real, like he was truly hanging hundreds of feet up in the air holding on by one hand. The expendable pilot, good actress, good part for her. Enjoyed a couple other of the good guys too.

The Bad: now why would you want to split the money with anyone but the necessary? The heist called for a pilot (the Lithgow character was a pilot as well as the leader). Why the woman? Ok, someone to pilot while the evil leader keeps tabs on everything. You got to have a guy on the inside to set everything up, kill the guards, transfer the money. Lithgow is there to get it, while the pilot flies the jet. Why the two badguy expendibles? And if you're going to hire muscle, you hire pros. Especially with that much money at stake. These were overly aggresive to the point of getting in the way of the heist. They weren't needed in the original equation. And when things didn't go as planned, all they managed to do was get killed. Some obvious mistakes here and there, like the cable holding the choper to the side of the cliff. Most of the mistakes, like that one, was just sloppy. No excuse.

The Ugly: Ah. We're back to Lithgow. Who on earth came up with the idea of him using a Gawd-awful British accent? He is NOT Anthony Hopkins, by birth or talent. He is merely an adequate actor. Not a great actor. Adequate. With that idiotic accent, he wasn't even that. And, no, calling everyone a ""boss-tard"" will not make us even remotely believe you're British. You just sounded like an American actor trying to do an accent badly. If you must have a British bad guy, next time hire one. My favorite would be Alan Rickman, who stole ROBIN HOOD and DIE HARD from their famous stars.

From this point on, CLIFFHANGER maintains that sense of dizzying tension and is one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies.  With gorgeous scenery and awesome ""cliffhanging"" sequences, CLIFFHANGER never lets up and is a pure adrenaline rush.  Stallone does well, as does his supporting cast:  John Lithgow (whom I will never forgive for killing Nancy Allen in Blowout); Craig Fairbass as the psychotic soccer player; Rex Linn as the repulsive Travers; Janine Turner as the lovely love interest; Michael Rooker as the onetime friend of Stallone's, and of course, Michelle Joyner as Sarah, whose plea for Stallone to save her life is as gutwrenching as ever.

Without Sylvester Stallone to be there, the show might be only worth watching for the fall of Sarah and the concentrated focus of Jessica in rescuing.  But even those, anybody can do the work.

Sylvester Stallone chose a tough career.  Acting is a fun but difficult living.  This actor must love acting.  The real sense of relieving from acting is again viewed in his final note where he held Jessica but showing all the signs ready to move on to either the reality of the life or to another acting role.",1100131200,,743,4.661538461538462

536337,4,6302921384,"A previous reviewer called CLIFFHANGER a ""guilty pleasure,"" and that is pretty much the way I see the film.
CLIFFHANER was a return to action form for its star Sylvester Stallone, after he had made his indelible mark on the genre with his RAMBO trilogy in '80s. His character here, Gabe Walker, is drastically scaled-down, befitting the film's ""high"" concept, which is basically ""DIE HARD on a mountain.""
Okay, so the premise (which is actually credited in this movie to a man named John Long) is not breathtakingly original---a nasty group of robbers led by evil Eric Qualen (John Lithgow, effectively playing his role to the hilt) lose three cases of American money in the Rockies and force Walker and companion Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker, he of HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) to help them find it. Director Renny Harlin---who also directed DIE HARD 2---brings all his action expertise to bear on the thin plot and actually succeeds in crafting a good action film out of it. He was lucky in getting cinematographer Alex Thomson on his team, and Thomson makes the most of the Italian Dolomites (standing in for the Rockies) mountain settings by creating shots that revel in its scenic grandeur and impart an appropriately dizzying sense of vertigo to the proceedings. And Harlin uses his penchant for fast action pacing to good effect here, generating an exciting sense of momentum that hardly ever lets up until the final showdown.
So, as action entertainment, CLIFFHANGER can be counted as a success. So why do I find it a ""guilty"" pleasure rather than simply a pleasure? Well, I have to admit that I found some of the violence in the second half of the film a little too much at times---not only gratuitous but sometimes downright brutal. The first half of the film is much more discreet with the bloodshed, relying more on genuine suspense-building and awesome special effects and stunts to make its proper effect (the first twelve-minute sequence is arguably the last word in sweat-inducing suspense and mounting tension). In the second half, though, the script (credited to Michael France and Stallone) and director let rip with gory abandon, and thus we get images of a black bad guy getting skewered upon a stalactite by the hero, and scenes like Tucker being kicked in the ribs and nose like a soccer ball for a good minute or so by a British terrorist (with some tasteless slo-mos to draw out the grand brutality). Did we really need to be subjected to such witless violence? Do the filmmakers assume that we are all so base in our tastes that we actually get turned on by this bloody stuff? Well, who knows? Maybe they have a point there, since I admit that the first time I saw this film I was shocked but hardly appalled by the violence on offer here. It is only after having seen it a few times since then that I am starting to question the validity of the violent scenes on offer here. Harlin started the film out so well, but then, after about an hour or so, it turns into a second-rate one-upping of icicle-in-the-eye scene in his superior DIE HARD 2.
Notwithstanding my unease about the violence in this movie, though, it must be said that CLIFFHANGER works. It is sometimes very exciting and suspenseful, the performances basically get the job done, and overall this is one of the better DIE HARD clones, thanks to some great cinematography and noteworthy action scenes. If neither of the first two DIE HARD films are available for rental, this will fit the bill. Just don't be surprised, after it is over, if you feel a little guilty about having enjoyed it as much as you did.",1089590400,,3603,4.711568938193344
536338,5,6302921384,"CliffHanger made in 1993 is one of the most exciting action films on screen. The stunts and location in the movie are unbelievable.
It stars Sylvester Stallone as Gabriel Walker, and (Michael Rooker)as Hal Tucker as 2 climbing experts whose friendship comes to an end, when Tucker's girlfriend , Sarah
falls to her death while climbing when Gabe tries to rescue her. Tucker blames Walker for the accident and hasn't forgiven him ever since.
Jess Dieghan ( Janine Turner) plays Gabriel girlfriend and coworker on these hi-risk rock climbing jobs.
The basic plot in CliffHanger is that a group of terrorists led by a madman named Qualin (John Lighgow) are stealing money from the Treasury Department and making their escape through an airplane. Mr. Travers is the Treasury Agent who is assigned the task of showing an FBI agent, Mr. Mateson, how to find the sum of money that was stolen from Treasury department. However, Mr. Mateson's true job is to find the traitor inside the Treasury Department. It just so happens that Mr. Mateson, is on the same airplane that the terrorist, and the traitor
is, and in a really great scene, blows away a couple of the terrorists and puts their plan to steal the money on hold.
Eventually, Mr. Qualin and his remaining terrorists friends escape, but not before the money they stole gets tossed into the icy mountains below them. Qualin and his friends, stranded on the mountains, and angry about losing their money, come up a with a plan to get back.
They pretend to be stranded on the mountains, and call in a rescue team to get them, and to eventually force them to get their money.
The rescue team answers and you guessed it, it's Gabe Walker and his ex friend Hal Tucker who answer the call.
Now the action really stars and Gabe, and his friends must try to find a way to stop the madman Qualin and his terrorists.
There are really some amazing stunts in Cliffhanger. There are great action scenes, including a big avalanche scene, there is also a great scene in which Gabe literally
surfs on the ice while avoiding the machine gun bullets of the terrorists chasing them.
Stallone's character, Gabe is also a very smart guy, he comes up with some pretty good plans to foil Qualin's plan, while at the same time using his strong muscles as an added weapon. Stallone is his usual calm and cool self, delivering the smart, but lethal Walker, and gives his character some depth throughout the movie.
John Lighgow is also great as Qualin. Litghow has made a good career playing the psycho. In the memorable Ricochet, his acting as the psychotic left a lasting impression with me.
Now there's probably some people who already have seen Cliffhanger before, but the DVD delivers the movie in a way you haven't seen before

*Special look at the special

The movie was directed by Renny Harlin, another one of those directors that don't get the spotlight but who have directed many blockbuster movies including:
*Die Hard 2
*Driven
Furthermore, the hits that Harlin has directed have been made into
games: Cliffhanger was made for the Sega Genesis, Supernes and Gameboy. The games for it, are actually pretty good. Likewise Die Hard 2 was made for the pc and Playstation, along with Driven for the Gameboy Advance.
So Cliffhanger is an awesome movie, and now with the special DVD for it, it's definitely worth seeing once again.",1088640000,,3417,4.74453781512605
536339,3,6302921384,"Since I am writing this review, I am also publicly confessing to having spent two hours watching Cliffhanger. After this, nothing I suffer in life can be a humiliation.
This movie received four Razzie nominations: Worst picture of the year, worst screenplay (Sylvester Stallone), worst supporting actress (Janine Turner) and worst supporting actor (John Lithgow). There are a couple of injustices here: Stallone was denied his rightful, annual Razzie nomination for worst actor. The jury must have been stacked with Stallone fans that year. And I enjoyed Lithgow's over-the-top turn as the leader of the crooks.
But you can't argue with Janine Turner's (Northern Exposure) nomination: I could have given a better and sexier performance as a female, in spite of being a bit, shall we say, well-nourished, and having a mustache.
This movie made a ton of money, which also makes sense. It's entertaining. Director Renny Harlin knows how to make action thrillers. In this one, the Treasury Department is transporting over $150 million in $1000 bills by jet; a band of crooks aims to rob the couriers. The money ends up on the snowy side of a mountain, so the crooks kidnap world-class mountain rescue experts Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, to track it down.
Norman Kent and Alex Thomson's cinematography is breathtaking, the stunts are truly death-defying, and some of the actors are good, most notably Rooker, Ralph Waite (as a rescuer), Lithgow and Rex Linn (as a treasury agent).
Since we live in a therapeutic society, I can't take responsibility for my actions -- it was all my 3-year-old son's fault. The movie came on late at night, after he had woken up (and while I was supposed to be working), and he insisted we see it together. It turns out, his judgment was excellent, as Cliffhanger is perfectly suited for the sensibility of a three-year-old boy.
In case you have too much money on your hands, you can order this from Amazon. If your neighbors see you taking the video package from your mailbox, you can just say, ""Oh, I thought I'd finally give Gone with the Wind a shot.""
Should you decide, instead, to rent Cliffhanger from a video store, you might try a trench coat, dark glasses, and a hat pulled down low on your face. Or as with other pornographic films, you could say to yourself, ""What the hell, my neighbors are buying the same trash,"" and go in as you are.

Armed this time with a pedigree to prove, and a director that knows his stuff (Renny Harlin), Sly became a box-office sensation once more, and wowed audiences all over the world with this phenomenal thriller.
The acting is average, with a few bright spots; John Lithgow (in his third incarnation as a villain--the others being ""Ricochet"" and ""Raising Cain"") overshadowing Stallone in a battle of one-liners, and Michael Rooker, who always manages to put in a solid effort in whatever film he's in.  The real star of this movie, however, isn't the superbly filmed action, but the cinematography.
Set in the Italian Dolemites, the scenery is breathtaking--some of the best mountain footage seen in theatres in a long time.

John Lithgow is the movie's main villain, and he works his stuff to great effect, and set up against Stallone's he-man heroics, the two are both tremendous.  And the action ante is set up far more than other Die Hard rip-offs such as Executive Decision. Renny Harlin's direction makes the film's tendencies toward brutal violence get rather extreme at times, and to see Stallone manage to beat the meatloaf out of the bad guys after getting wasted is sometimes beyond believable, but as the DVD's deleted scenes show, they actually toned down the film's superman-like qualities to good effect.
Action aside, the plot is silly at times and some of the characters are taken straight from the big book of bad movie stereotypes. But Stallone's devotees don't care, as this film can be seen now as nostalgic after seeing the big guy's recent flop movies (Get Carter).

A really really bad movie.",994204800,,323,5.0
536443,4,6302921384,"""Cliffhanger"" is one of those movies where the suspense sequences and action stunts outweigh everything else by a landslide (pardon the pun). There's really not much to the development of characters or plot, except that the movie uses the script as an excuse to put its characters in extremely dangerous situations one after another. On this ground, it works splendidly, and while the story and characterization are weak, there are still some good performances turned in by the cast.
The movie sets itself up with the promised white-knuckle action in a sequence that brings on the tension but fails to move us emotionally. On his way to retrieve his best friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) and his girlfriend, Sarah, from a 4,000 peak, Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) makes an attempt to rescue Sarah after she begins falling, without success. Hal blames it on Gabe, and Gabe's own self-torment keeps him from town and from his own love, Jessie (Janine Turner). This move, while meant to establish emotion and character depth, doesn't do a whole lot for the script.
The movie then transfers us to a U.S. treasury plane, where three cases of money, in bills unusable except by a select group of people in the world, are being flown across the country. The plane is soon hijacked by a group of terrorists, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). However, his plans are ruined once they lose the cases at high altitude and crash in the Rocky Mountains, where they call for help under the guise of being in danger.
Sparing the rest of the movie's twists and turns, once Gabe and Hal arrive on the scene, they are taken hostage and forced to climb mountains and hike through forests to find the three cases of money, soon bringing more people into the situation than the movie calls for.
The movie chooses to focus more on the action than on the story itself, which really isn't that bad a move. From the high-altitude stunts to the white-knuckle suspense generated by the scenes charged with high-octane suspense, the movie doesn't lose its ability to get our attention with actors hanging on the edges of cliffs and mountains, holding on for dear life.
The tension generated by the terrorists is, at best, mediocre. Even under the shadow of leader Lithgow, whose flair for turning a colorful phrase at every moment is funny yet unsettling, the movie never really gives us any reason to fear the henchmen along for the climb. There are certain moments, such as that in which the only black terrorist hunts Gabe and Jessie in a cavern, or when Gabe is trapped beneath an ice-covered lake. However, the only people the terrorists knock off we aren't given too much time to know, so what reason do we have to care?
Stallone is back in fine form, the action hero we've always admired from his earlier ""Rocky"" days. He's required to carry a lot of the heroism on his shoulders, and big as those shoulders are, that is no easy task. Yet, he is able to pull it off, with the help of Rooker and Turner, who give jobs well done in their roles.
While not the best action film ever made, ""Cliffhanger"" is a commendable piece of suspense that works due to its breathtaking action sequences and the altitude of its settings. It tends to drag in places, but really, with a movie that's so focused on getting us into a sweat, what does it matter?",992908800,,3324,4.674061433447099

There's even a few touching moments with Sly and his girlfriend (or should we say ex-girlfriend?).

This movie was absolutely awesome in its color, scenic beauty, suspense, and acting.  However, I was and am disappointed that the producers felt it necessary to use an overabundance of obscene language.  The overuse of this language was totally unnecessary as the storyline was novel and would have been wonderfully entertaining without every other sentence containing ""colorful metaphors"" (so to quote Captain Kirk).

536502,3,6302921384,"As a rock climber, don't get me started on all the technical/factual errors of this film; I'll just concentrate on the DVD features. The commentary from Harlin and Stallone are combined with mostly Harlin doing  the talking. I think Stallone makes comments in only 3 points in the movie.  The commentary from Harlin is interesting especially combined with the  comments from the crew. The art director and editor give the crew comments.  The art director gave very interesting comments on how most of the effects  were done, the editor's comments were very boring. There's an intro by  Harlin about why he made the trailer, as it is, which is a bit unorthodox,  but not much. Stallone hosts the making of featurette and is fairly  interesting giving info on how the major effects were done. There are  actually only 2 deleted scenes with a separate introduction by Harlin for  one which I guess counts as the third.  One is a completely unrealistic ice  climb by Stallone and I other I can't remember, regardless, they added  nothing to the film and were rightfully cut. The two special effects  behind-the-scenes are of the helicopter explosion and the introduction  fall. The three storyboard comparisons were of the helicopter explosion,  the air-to-air transfer, and the introduction fall; boring. The photos in  the galleries were too small and maybe on a huge screen you could see  detail, but probably not. For the climbers out there, Wolfgang Gullich was  Stallone's climbing double who died shortly before this movie was released  and the film is dedicated to him.  Ron Kulk (climbing double), Jim Bridwell  (rigger), Bob Gaines (safety officer) and David Breashears (camara  operator, IMAX Everest) also worked on this film. The only extra that  really makes this DVD worth it is the crew commentary otherwise everything  else is just fluff. I might add this to my collection mainly because I'm a  climber and as unrealistic as it is, the Italian Alps, where a lot of the  scenes were filmed, is just gorgeous country.",964396800,,2028,4.958333333333333

John Lithgow is excellent  as the baddy, although he does always look a bit to kind.

Stallone was cast as Gabriel Walker, a rescue ranger who is traumatized after failing to save a woman. Things get worse when a team of cold blooded, international mercenaries/terrorists search the mountains of Colorado for stolen money. There were a lot of Die Hard clones in those days. The Fox TV Network version removed a scene where Leon's character shoots a teenager to death with a gun. Gabe Walker(Stallone) sweats, bleeds, and almost freezes to death in the film.
