1062455,5,6305742030,"What a great movie for the whole family to sit down and watch together. I thoroughly enjoyed this Movie about what happens when the Daughter of the King of the Trooping Fairies falls in love with the Son of the Leader of  the Kerry Leprechauns, with the parallel story of the brash American and  the stubborn Irish girl falling in love at the same time. Completely  enchanting with great color,special effects and wonderful Irish scenery and  a fantastic cast of Actors from Ireland, England and America. Sit back and  let the Leprechaun Magic and Music take over your heart and ears. 5 out of  5.",956275200,22,597,4.6380952380952385

Quaid is excellent in the lead role, and the woman lead , whose name escapes me as I write here, was fabulous.

It is a very unusual plot with a war between the Leprechauns and the Fairies, but very well done.

I watched it so much, the video didn't work very well any longer.  So I was sooo happy to find it on Amazon, and at a great price.  Whoppie is just amazing as the Grande Banche - ruler of this magical world.  The world of the Faeries is so incredibly beautiful, from the swan shaped bed of the princess, to the underwater castle, to the ballroom with the faeries that float as they dance it is just a beautifully created fantasy.  The enhanced blue eyes of the princess, even made my football-playing-all-male-son, remark on their beauty.  Whenever, I had had a really bad week, I sit down with a large cup of my favorite tea, curl up in my favorite overstuffed chair, under my favorite blanket and put on this movie - I am immediately transformed to another world and all is happy and beautiful.

1064200,5,6305742030,"As a fantasy fiction author, the only problem with this movie is it's the abbreviated version. The full version, over 4 hours long, occasionally is on TV. This abbreviated version costs much of the magic and music to fit it to size, but the essence of the story is still there. Fairies dueling with fairies over an imagined slight that will cost them everything, with two humans unwittingly caught up in the battle, that will make or break their own romance. The characters, animation and story line are superb, and I would highly recommend it.",1388016000,3,544,4.7368421052631575

Needless to say, I was very disappointed especially because of the misleading information given on my original purchase.  The movie itself is a very good story with excellent acting; humor, romance, and fantasy all rolled into one.  The special effects are realistic.

1064538,4,6305742030,"I saw this on TV as an overly lengthy miniseries chocked full of even more tiresome commercials some time ago. The story was weak and the actors appeared plucked for their star power, however miscast. Top of the miscasting: as much as I love Whoopi Goldberg, she is implausibly cast as some sort of Irish fairy godmother, and she's good in comedy, but her straight acting is unconvincingly flat. Randy Quaid is the last person I'd cast as a convincing romantic lead. Roger Daltrey is a doddering mess, like an outtake from an old TV version of Alice In Wonderland. And call me mean, but I never cared for Colm Meaney, even on old Star Trek episodes. Zoe Wanamaker is actually quite wonderful in it. Kieran Culkin is wasted (why have they never cast him as Robert Downey Jr.'s little brother in any thing? They look so related). It's filled with schlocky Irish pop ballad music and river dance cliches.

That said, as a reference for fans of all things faery, The Magical World of The Leprechauns has perhaps the best set and costume designs of any faerieland I've ever seen on film. The details of fine-veined insect fairy wings and cockleshell armor as well as the Rococo embellishments of the fairy palace in the sky are truly breathtaking.

It also has some very lovely Irish countryside cinematography.

And for those reasons, I felt the need to have it in my collection, even if I have to sit through 170 minutes of dull plot and flawed romance.",1311379200,2,1450,4.634241245136187

Now let me state up front I love Whoopi Goldeberg. She was great in Star Trek series, and I love all her comedy movies. I own most of them. However, putting her in as the Banshee in this movie is like putting a Irishman in as a globetrotter in a movie about the Harlem Globetrotters. It doesn't fit, so please stop doing it whoever is responsible for this kind of off culture/race casting. It reminded me how they cast Will Smith as James West for ""Wild, Wild, West"". Next I suppose they will cast William Macy as ""Shaft"". I don't like racism, and I certainly don't like casting white or blacks in movies that aren't appropriate to the culture or the theme of the movie. It is like when they use to make up white men and women to be Indians, Chinese,  or blacks. Very inappropriate.

I like her as an actress, I just didn't like her performance here.  Randy Quaid on the other hand is great, and his relationship with his love interest and her crazy brothers, and even one of the Wee folk are what really make this movie.

All the characters are well developed--Randy Quaid's performance showing him to be a truly talented actor as he usually is--and with the supporting cast of seasoned and similar stuff--plus a few new faces who did well in their roles.  The special effects I give 4-Stars but taking into account that this film is dated, they were spot-on for the time it was filmed.  The sets were first class believable with the costume designers/makeup artists doing a fabulous job for this film.

There's humor, mischief being made, pathos and sorrow, two modern and magical romances (a strong ""Romeo and Juliet"" influence in the film), with fighting and death in the Fairy Kingdom--the latter reversed by the powers of The Grand Banshee (Whoopee Goldburg) at the climax, along with a true ""gusher"" of a surprise ending [all gold is NOT yellow] to leave you smiling as the film ""fades to black""...literally!

There is constant feuding between the faeries and the leprachauns. The Grand Banshee, played by Whoopi Goldberg, seems to be in charge of all the creatures (she is also sort of like a mother nature character). She tries to help them, but the adventure begins when the fueding sides fail to listen.

1064880,3,6305742030,"""The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns"" is an Irish fairy version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" with a dual romance going on simultaneously, perhaps a bit sappy and slightly flawed, but slightly entertaining none-the less in terms of delivery.

Randy Quaid stars as a man under the guise of returning to Ireland to seek his ""roots"" and take a long extended vacation when he in fact, is secretly making plans to convert a long stretch of the Irish country side around the town and cabin he rents. In the cabin he rents he discovers, it's already inhabited by the leader of the Leprechauns and his wife and family. In the background of the fairy tale, a feud is occuring between the faires (trooping fairies) and the leprechauns and other (solitary fairies), all of which are found within Irish mythology concerning ""the fae"" or ""fairies"".

What could have potentially been perhaps the best example of ""fae and faery tale myth"" come to life, is as was stated before a decidedly flawed piece of work. As was said by a previous viewer, Quaid instead of seeming uncomfortable, tries to add some zest to his character by attempting a pale inspiried version of ""The Quiet Man"" staring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. A wonderful film about a man rediscovering romance and his roots in Ireland, much like the character Jack Woods (i.e. Randy Quaid). Orla Brady playes Kathleen Fitzpatrick the firey dark haired beauty and love interest for Randy Quaids character. While Quaid seems subdued and notably lacking in terms of any kind of shine in the character of Jack. Orla Woods is a bit to snappish and shrill and fickle in terms of having any kind of real appeal. It's hard to sustain belief that these two have anything other then a simple attraction to each other rather then being deeply in love as we are supposed to believe they are.

Mean while in the realm of the Faery, Princess Jessica of the ""Trooping Fairies"" and Mickey Muldoon of the Leprechauns, meet and like Romeo and Juliet fall in love over the course of perhaps an hour or more when Mickey and his Leprechaun friends crash a fairy ball. What results is a rather complex and poorly plotted story line involving bumbling Fairy Kings and Leprechaun leaders, and their frustrated and much far far quicker wives. What is probably supposed to be, one imagines a kind of illusion to each of these men being no different from each other aside from race, isn't dwelt upon enough to give any kind of creedence and only leaves them seeming bumbling and foolish rather then enduring. Jessica is played with wide eyed and high pitched bathering by Caroline Carver.

Aside from Colm Meany the remainder of the cast of ""Irish"" seems pulle straight from the set of an Irish Spring soap commerical in terms of poor accents. Ireland itself is played off as a land that never moved beyond the early 20th century in terms of no cars, faint electricity and simple villagers that one could place in the background of a monster horror movie with pitch forks and torches.

To be fair, this story seems to be here for mere entertainment rather then any kind of deep messages and and relating tales of the irish fairies or the evils of coorperate development. What could have been an excellent story that is reminiscent of ""The Quiet Man"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" with twists of irish faeries is a poor movie that deserves perhaps a rental or a check out from a local library rather then spending the full amount to buy and own it.",1100217600,6,3455,4.675986842105263
1064881,1,6305742030,"Please, hear me out: We watched this movie and I have to say that it was very well put together with acceptable production design and a promising concept. But it's faults far outweigh it's virtues. The movie is LONG and it has too many story lines for any child to follow along with, and anyone old enough to follow along would rather watch something less childish as this is. It has brief moments of charm, too much irish spirit, which again children won't understand, and relys too much upon it's effects. None of it makes logical sense, granted it is a fairytale, but even still nothing is explained. There are too many characters, and the Romeo and Juliette story completely complicates everything to such a disaster that a war breaks out and nothing is accomplished. Why would a child want to see this nonsensical piece of work? Why would an adult. There are so many better family films that are gripping for both children AND adults. If you really want to see something that you will adore forever go and look at ""The 10th Kingdom"" because there are movies with morals, and movies who have stories that incorporate points. I prefer the ones with stories- logical stories- ones that one can follow without difficulty or a notepad. I hope this helped.",1099353600,17,1255,4.683257918552036

Several mentioned that this was poorly made, did not have very good computer imaging, stiff acting, over all not a great movie.  Well, I beg to differ.  Just as when reading a fairy tale, one must suspend their disbelief.  Of course it's not realistic- it's a dang fairy tale.  I found the characters to be colorful and enchanting.  The story line is classic- about star crossed lovers.  The shots of the county and woods are beautiful.  The substory about the humans is tender and sweet. The score was a wonderful Irish mix, it made the movie. As for the graphics, I didn't even notice if they were less then perfect because the story is wonderful.  Part of the charm is in the imperfections.  People waste too much time picking movies apart instead of just enjoying them. This is a movie for dreamers, poets, romantics.

1065120,1,6305742030,"First, let me state I am student of Mythology and Folklore of the British Isles, including Britain, Scotland, Ireland, Isle of Man, Hebrides, Isle of Jersey, as well as Breton, Normandy, Wales, etc. The word Faerie encompasses all mythological creatures from these areas, thus Leprechauns are indeed Faeries. Another note, if the writer and/or researcher bothered to pick up a single book on mythology and folklore, they would have noticed that there are NO female Leprechauns whatsoever. Leprechauns are also Non-Trooping Faeries. The so-called Faeries, which are actually more like Pixies or Pillywiggins.
In short, this movie is utter pap, having no research done whatsoever, but what can one expect from NBC, which featured a dreadlocked Calypso in The Odyssey and a completely uneducated retelling of the Arthurian Legend. (Queen Mab originates from Queen Medb of the Irish legend called The Tain, not Arthurian legend.)",1017619200,9,925,5.386206896551724

1065122,5,6305742030,"To start with I'll list the bad points, just to get them over and done with. The movie really has three story plots - one dealing with humans and one dealing with the fairies, and the last a mix of both that deals with the consequences of the war that ensues between the fairies and the leprechauns. You can never quite tell which one is meant to be the main focus of the movie, which makes it feel not quite stable. You would expect the fairies and leprechauns to be the main protaginists because of the title of the movie, but it really begins and ends with the humans. In saying that, this human story centres around Jack Green (Randy Quaid) who has come to Ireland on behalf of a building development company to see what the place has to offer. He falls in love with the lovely Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Orla Bradly) who is none to pleased to discover his true intentions for being in her beloved country. This half of the story is too grown-up for kids and too predictable and over-used for adults to be very interesting, and unfortunatly it tends to overshadow the far more interesting fairy-tale, which is as wonderful a fairy tale as you could wish to see.
The regal blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Trooping Fairies and the mischevious and fun-loving red-haired, green-eyed Kerry Leprechauns have never been friends, but for years have maintained an uneasy peace for the sake of Ireland's natural world, which they both help maintain. However, following a Romeo-and-Juliet storyline, the son of the leprechaun chief Mickey Muldoon (the adorable Daniel Bretts) and his friends sneak into the fairies' castle during their Midsummer Ball and promptly falls in love with the King and Queen's only daughter, the beautiful Princess Jessica (the equally enchanting Caroline Carver). Other parallels to Shakespeare's play are evident in Mickey's best friend Sean Devine, who is killed by Jessica's jealous cousin Count Grogan, and the two lovers flee captivity, leaving the mounting war between the fairies and leprechauns behind them.
It is this fairytale story line that far surpasses that of the human story, and makes the movie worth watching. The sweetness and charm of both Mickey and Jessica is wonderful to watch as they grapple with the guilt over the war they have caused and their reluctance to return to their homes and thus face separation. Their entire journey, from their meeting at the fairy ball, Jessica's seclusion in the underwater city, their travels through the swamp and the climb up Moonstone Mountain are accompanied by flawless special effects, lovely scenery and set designs and beautiful costumes, making it a classic fairytale.
The last story is of course this war that the two lovers inadvertantly cause, and starts when a surprised Jack rescues the chief of the leprechauns Seamus Muldoon (who else but Colm Meaney) from drowning. He vows to put an end to the war that is destroying Ireland and with Kathleen, Mickey and Jessica they seek the help of the Grand Banshee (Whoopi Goldberg). Never mind the rather strange fact that the leader of the Irish fairies and leprechauns is African-American, because Whoopi has great sarcasm and comic timing.
Lastly I'd like to mention the parents of both Jessica and Mickey, who provide most of the laughs for this movie - King Boric (Roger Daltrey) and Queen Morag (Harriet Walter) of the Fairies, and Seamus and Mary Muldoon (Zoe Wanamaker) for the leprechauns, who bicker in all directions - husband against wife, wife against the other wife, and husband against the other husband.
Two out of these three plots are a joy to watch and even my father who usually runs screaming from these types of movies warmed up to it and chuckled more than once. See this movie, as the true fairy-tale of adventure and romance is perfect.",1016409600,10,3787,4.891135303265941

1065191,5,6305742030,Hi everyone!  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It pulls you into the story and makes you want to see more.  The battle scenes are really good.  I love the fairies and the leprechauns!  My favorite  character is Princess Jessica.,958694400,,245,4.333333333333333
1065192,5,6305742030,"It was a great movie I loved the fairys and the Leprechauns!  Their costumes were outstanding! It had a very good storyline too!  I want to know where I can get the soundtrack?  Or the song ""We can Fly  away"" by Emma Townshend. anyone who knows e-mail me at  Siob13han@aol.com",957744000,,276,4.44
1065193,5,6305742030,"Fantastic fantasy action, great FX and stunt work by the British stunt boys. But I would say this as I was Mickies stunt double, which does give a slightly weighted opinion. Seriously great blue sceen and art work. John  Henderson portrays Peter Barnes' story with a great and magical touch.  Giving it a brilliant flow in mithical viewing. The boys playing the  Leprechauns were top knotch, even though Kieran's accent could do with some  fine tuneing. I particularly like the guest apperance from the one and only  CC Smiff, playing the charecter 'Head Door-Man'- Please do look out for him  bursting the bubbles of guests entering the fairies party.(gripping stuff)-  Tristan Matthiae also has a good little slot in the film with himself  appearing as a Pooka and in the stunt credit list. Tristan can also bee  seen this season at a theme park near you jumping from great heights. What  more can I say? But 'Good Luck -C- stage and Good Luck Every Body'",956793600,,957,4.745454545454545
1065194,5,6305742030,"I first saw this movie when it was on NBC, and instantly fell in love with it. I am not Irish, but the scenery was so beautiful, and the actors were divine. It broke my heart when it was over, and I didn't think it was going  to be released on video-Luckily for me, it was!  I was head over heels for  Mickey Muldoon! Anybody aware of the actor that portrayed him? I've looked  everywhere-and I haven't received my own copy-so someone check the credits!  Please! This was a terrific movie..I could watch it over and over again..",956448000,,528,4.346938775510204

I love most anything Irish/Gaelic and this was so heartfelt and at the same time hilarious and comical, that I guarantee you will love it.

It is so Great, and Fun to watch the Way they fight is Hilarious! Plus the way it Ends, is so Great No real Tragedy in it at All! I Highly 100% Recommend watching this film!

7893392,5,6305742030,"So cute! They did a great job. I tend to hate fairy tales that take place in the present (modern day) time, But the ""FilmRise"" company seems to have made some GREAT fairy tales (taking place in the modern day) that are just very well done. The best ones were made in the 90's. It seems to me like they've changed directors (or whomever imagines up the ""feel"" of the story they are creating). These days ""FilmRise"" series/films are more serious, less imaginative and quite dark in nature. (Sea Wolf for example... Couldn't even stand finishing the 1st episode.)
The only thing I HATE about ""FilmRise's"" 90's modern-style fairy tales are the use of CORNY modern-day music! Example from ""The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns"": the scene where the 4 leprechauns infiltrated the fairies' dance ball (episode 1 - 41:10)! JESUS that music clashes with the feel of the film so badly! Maybe this was a technique to keep younger children interested in the story. I've noticed young kids get really bored with old fashioned fairy tales these days. Shame really.
Other than that awful music here & there, this (and many others from FilmRise in the 90's) are WONDERFUL!",1523664000,,1157,4.79
