2589579,4,B000FUF7AI,The Real Rucker Park Legends is an interesting look into the history of the Rucker Park. However you don't get to see a whole lot of basketball footage. This is really more for those who want to learn more about this legendary court and it's players in the past.,1362441600,,262,4.36734693877551
2589580,1,B000FUF7AI,"I understand this is a documentary but it doesn't have action,
I was expecting at lest some highlights of Fly Williams or Manigault
or Fred Hammond. there was none. What's the point of this movie..
history?",1361923200,,206,4.75
2589581,3,B000FUF7AI,"I am originally from the new york/new jersey area and I found it interesting and needed however, I felt it lacked depth and strength in the diversity of interviews and people interviewed. This is good to have if you are a fan of b-ball and particularly if you are from the area. Excellent conversational piece for any true b-baller....good to have in the house no doubt.",1360972800,,370,4.621212121212121
2589582,4,B000FUF7AI,"True there might not be a whole lot of great footage from back in the day, but it's out there!  The makers should've waited till they got more video to make this DVD.  But good history of the Rucker and if thats whats out , true ballers will still appreciate it.",1234569600,,262,4.117647058823529
2589583,2,B000FUF7AI,"As a straight forward, no frills documentary offering historical insight into the importance of Rucker Park and its namesake, I give this title 5 stars.  However, this video is virtually devoid of highlights.  If you are interested in hearing stories of how great these players were (without video proof), this is the video for you.  I expected to see video footage.  I didn't see one ""helicopter"" move, Ron Artest is shown talking to one of the legends (after  he hangs up his cell phone), and Julius Erving is only shown in an interview, not in action.  Again, if you are interested in hearing the recalled oral history of the park, you will simply adore this DVD.  If you want some footage interlaced with the proclatmations of how great a player was, skip this title!  Moreover, this title should not be in the category of sports documentary - it should STRICTLLY be listed as oral history.  I once knew a guy who could jump from the free throw line, do 3 360's and dunk the ball with his elbow - believe it - although I can't seem to make this computer upload the video proof!",1212192000,12,1081,4.530927835051546
2589584,1,B000FUF7AI,"I Love Hoops! Usually anything basketball satisfies me, but I expected SOME action here and there was none! Respect for the legends of the game and for the Ruckers history, but it's impossible to not sleep through this one.",1196985600,3,223,4.743589743589744
2589585,5,B000FUF7AI,"This documentary might very well be the best work ever done on inner city basketball.  From former pro legends like Kareem Jabbar, Dr J, and Connie Hawkins to underground legends such as Earl (the Goat) Manigault & Joe (the Destroyer) Hammond.

I met ""The Goat"" in the late 70s when I was playing with the Bronx Gaucho's in the ""Goat"" tournament. The ""Goat"" was refing at the time.  Meeting the Goat was like meeting royalty; like meeting the King of a Nation (honestly).

I remember seeing Joe play in a tournament where he hit 30ft bank shots all day and tapped dunked sitting on someones back.  This documentary not only introduces the Holcombe Rucker story but it tells the story of the Harlem Rens and other basketball icons of the 1930s Harlem Renaissance.  Interviews with Hammond, Hawthorne Wingo, Dr J, Kareem and the old timers were superb.  I can't say enough about this DVD, it far exceeded my expectations.  I know major cities like Chitown and LA also have an inner city underground lore, but N.Y.C. is the Mecca and this DVD represents this to the fullest.  Many thanks to the producers and everyone that made this DVD possible.  It will give all viewers an education on inner city basketball on the East Coast.",1176854400,5,1226,4.686915887850467

8126756,5,B000FUF7AI,I sat frozen  listening and watching the first hand accounts of the history of rucker tournament . It was like sitting on the street corner listen to guys have been to war and come back. I'm from New York and I know basketball is war and life or death for  play I myself finish streetball champion the only criticism I have of video is it at the N one of those guys criticize West 4th Street Park which to me is the ultimate it's like the difference between an organized boxing match and a street fight life or death was at West 4th Street I not fear rucker but I bet you they feared coming to West,1377475200,,598,4.102564102564102
