characters and spectacular young cast. Another great one shoved to
the wayside. Somebody get rid of these TV execs.",1431388800,2,184,4.78125

8241387,1,B0011D7AEY,"It's in Dutch, there was no English subtitles available. I had to order another version with subtitles in English. The case was in Dutch, and the menus was as well.",1387929600,,164,4.5
8241388,5,B0011D7AEY,"This is a great spin off of Spooks, it's too bad it only got one series, and that the BBC cancelled other series. They left us with a cliffhanger that will never be answered.",1387929600,,174,4.147058823529412
8241389,1,B0011D7AEY,"A show that traded on the good name of Spooks, a far better series!

This series is very poor, in all aspects. The acting,the story line and whole production values. You have this 'group' of Child actor drop outs, pretending they are 'grown up' who party hard and think they are part of the intelligence community. How the British BBC approved the airing of this 'show' is beyond belief. A needless production that insults the intelligence.

Do not believe me look to Amazon.co.uk, and see its very poor reviews!",1366502400,2,512,4.741573033707865
